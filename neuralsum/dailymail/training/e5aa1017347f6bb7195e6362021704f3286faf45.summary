@entity0 was my idol in the fifties ... i was devastated after the @entity4 air disaster @entity5 , @entity6 and sir @entity7 all make my team of the sixties @entity0 joins @entity10 and @entity11 in my team of the fifties @entity14 is one of the game ’s most colourful and outspoken characters			1
here , in the final part of his brilliant book , he reflects on a footballing world before pilates , ice baths and prima donnas			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... @entity23 reminds me of @entity5 , the way he would run with the ball tight to his foot			1
tap , tap , tap			2
he would take the ball up to defenders like that , and then swivel and go past them			2
there were so many great players in that @entity37 team but , even then , @entity5 stood tall			1
he was fresh off the boat and straight into the first team			2
he did n’t really bother with youth football			2
i can remember reading the account by @entity43 , @entity37 ’s goalkeeper , of the first time he met @entity5			1
these days a midfielder receives the ball with a man marking him and we say he ’s brave			1
@entity50 was also a hard man who almost used to bully opponents			1
not the sort of chap that a young kid fresh over from @entity64 should be messing with			2
the first training session @entity5 had at @entity37 , he got the ball , ripped through the defence and made to shoot			1
@entity43 went one way , and @entity5 casually took the ball past him and rolled it into the net			1
next attack , the same thing happened			2
‘ do that to me again , son , ’ @entity50 warned , from his position on the seat of his pants , ‘ and you wo n’t be playing tomorrow			1
’ yet @entity5 just laughed it off			1
that was what made him so magnificent			2
there is a fantastic clip of @entity5 playing against @entity85			1
he is going through the defence , the mud is ankle deep , when @entity89 comes across and tries to cut him in half			2
@entity5 rides it , carries on and slots the ball in			1
best shoots for goal under pressure from former @entity85 hard man @entity96 best - pictured with his @entity98 car in 1969 - changed football forever @entity5 went out every game knowing there were players whose job was to hurt him , who actively tried to break his legs			1
yet they never stopped him demanding the ball , never stopped him running with it			2
i have n’t seen anybody as brave as @entity5			1
he was the best ; he had a style , a swagger when he played , that i do n’t think i ’ve seen since			2
girls screaming at him , boys trying to dress like him			2
there were other good players and good teams but also a pub mentality that did n’t really leave @entity120 football until the influx of foreign players			0
from the great @entity124 team to the @entity127 - winning @entity126 side and the @entity129 lot at @entity85 , just about every club liked a night out			0
most of the teams were made up of local boys and they all got on great			0
at @entity134 we mucked in together and roughed it when we had to			0
again on holiday in @entity49 , this time in 1967 , @entity5 enjoys a drink with boxer @entity138 i remember the terrible winter in 1963 , clearing the snow off the forecourt at @entity143 with the rest of the players so we could train			1
job done , we ’d play on it for two hours in silly little plimsolls , sliding everywhere			0
these days , the medical staff would have conniptions about the damage you could do to your calf muscles			0
but nobody knew , or cared , about that side of the game			0
these days , if a training pitch is n’t like @entity158 , the players complain			1
modern players moan about everything			0
they ’ll walk into a room with £ 200,000 of equipment and find some fault — no bananas in the fruit bowl or the temperature is n’t right			0
we used to spend a month running through forests , dodging cars on the @entity170			0
get back on the coach with everybody cramping up			0
nobody had heard of stretching exercises			0
we did n’t even warm up			0
@entity6 talks to young fans during a break in a @entity134 training session in 1962 the first time we saw the pitch was when the bell went to signal two minutes before kick - off			1
we might take the odd shot against the goalkeeper if we were feeling adventurous			0
there was no such thing as a warm - up			0
we thought a warm - up was standing by the radiator			0
once the game started , if you went down , a bloke would come out , put a sponge on your leg and that was the extent of his knowledge done			0
we did n’t know any different , we just got on with it			0
there were no agents to stir up a fuss			0
the manager called you into his office and gave you another £ 2 a week and you went home delighted			1
@entity0 was my idol in the fifties ... i was devastated after the @entity4 air disaster @entity5 , @entity6 and sir @entity7 all make my team of the sixties @entity0 joins @entity10 and @entity11 in my team of the fifties where are poor @entity217 's friends now he needs their help ? @entity219 had @entity134 stars standing and applauding at 15 ... then he signed for @entity221 ! @entity222 reminded me of @entity6 , that 's why he 's in my team of the @entity225 @entity226 , @entity227 and @entity228 make my team of the @entity230 @entity231 would have solved @entity126 's problems ... he was born to play left wing @entity234 heralded a change ... he introduced @entity236 and scouting reports to @entity126 @entity238 has the class of @entity240 but his attitude is holding back his talent @entity243 and @entity244 are warriors ... they were even prepared to do battle while on tv ! why @entity14 fears that the @entity120 manager is in danger of becoming extinct @entity243 nearly crossed @entity250 to join @entity251 ... and @entity252 was close to signing too pies in the canteen and throwing teacups at players ... the @entity253 killed all that ! @entity259 's @entity261 interviews @entity14 about his new book i was fortunate to spend the @entity264 working for one of the greatest football minds this country has ever produced : @entity268			1
it is no exaggeration to say that @entity89 changed the game in @entity126			1
i remember watching the 1966 @entity127 and i was able to pinpoint the moves and tactics that were straight from @entity134 ’s training ground			1
former @entity134 manager @entity268 oversees @entity126 training in 1970 as @entity227 stretches @entity134 players train at the @entity278 health centre on a dry pitch people talk about master coaches in football and i ’ll be frank and say i have n’t seen too many ; but @entity89 was among the few			1
the way @entity126 got @entity285 and @entity286 to get across defenders at the near post — i would credit @entity89 for that			0
the goals that @entity126 scored in 1966 were no accident			0
i used to watch @entity89 work for hours with the pair of them — when to pull away , how to time the return run			0
a lot of what @entity89 did stands up today			2
i ’m not ashamed to admit that i still use lessons from @entity89			0
