old - stager @entity0 scored a try double as @entity1 claimed a 20th successive victory over @entity3			1
the 37 - year - old @entity5 prop had not scored a try for almost 12 months but went over twice in the first half to help the @entity9 table toppers to their fifth win in a row			1
@entity3 's last home win against the @entity5 was a 21 - 12 @entity14 victory at @entity15 in november 1993 and their wait goes on after a 28 - 18 loss			1
but their depleted side turned in a battling show , trailing 16 - 12 at half - time , before slipping to only their second defeat in the last eight games			0
@entity0 broke his try drought with a double for @entity1 in their win over @entity3 on sunday full - back @entity28 followed up his two - try show against @entity31 with another brace with the @entity34 other touchdown from @entity35			1
@entity0 crossed for his side 's first two tries before @entity38 , the outstanding @entity39 and @entity40 went in to seal a hard - fought win in difficult conditions			1
@entity3 , already without the suspended @entity43 and @entity44 , were shorn of another six regulars but coach @entity46 was not taking the voluntary option to rest any of his players before saturday 's cup tie at @entity50			1
his hand was forced with @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and brothers @entity56 and @entity58 all injured			0
@entity46 handed debuts to under - 19 captain @entity61 - cousin of @entity62 - and 20 - year - old @entity63 with the back - row pair starting in the bench			0
apart from injured wingers @entity67 and @entity68 , the @entity5 were also missing @entity69 against the club where he started as a junior , @entity71 and @entity72			2
@entity73 used the strong wind to his advantage from the start with his kick off blowing back to give his side possession			0
but handling errors by @entity0 and @entity38 gave @entity3 confidence although @entity1 had the first chance to go ahead after 16 minutes			1
@entity82 spilled a pass in the wind with @entity84 pouncing on the loose ball 40 metres out but was hauled down by @entity86			0
the @entity5 did manage to go in front after 22 minutes when @entity0 charged over from close range after @entity3 conceded back - to - back penalties with @entity73 tagging on the conversion			1
but the @entity34 hit back immediately with @entity86 ' side - stepping run sending sub @entity35 over with @entity92 's kick levelling the scores			2
then @entity28 shot through the @entity1 defence to fire @entity3 into a 12 - 6 lead			1
@entity0 struck again to level at 12 - 12 after being the quickest to react to @entity97 's grubber kick			2
@entity3 thought they had regained the advantage four minutes before the break when @entity40 failed to gather @entity92 's towering kick in the gale and @entity103 collected the ball to race over			2
but referee @entity105 ruled @entity103 was offside before he was forced to hold up play when an advertising hoarding blew onto the pitch			0
the wind then came to the @entity5 aid with kicks by @entity112 and @entity113 held back by the conditions for @entity38 to cross in the corner and make it 16 - 12 at half - time			2
@entity38 looked suspiciously offside for his try and it had been a valiant effort by the @entity34 before the break			0
@entity1 have themselves some breathing space early in the second half with @entity124 slipping two tackles against his old club for the supporting @entity39 to scamper over and stretch the lead to 22 - 12			0
@entity3 refused to concede defeat and cut the gap back to four points when @entity28 out jumped @entity38 for his second try from a well judged @entity92 kick after 57 minutes			0
but @entity3 's elation was short lived when @entity39 's burst set up the chance for @entity40 to scythe past @entity35 and make it 28 - 18 on the hour and wrap things up .			0

@entity0 scored two tries for @entity1 in their win over @entity3
the victory is the @entity9 leaders ' 20th in a row over the @entity34
the @entity5 have now won their last five matches on the *bounce*
