it is often dismissed as part and parcel of growing up			0
but being picked on by your brother or sister can create deep mental scars , experts have warned			1
a study found that those who were regularly bullied by a sibling when a child were more likely to be clinically depressed or take an overdose in their late teens			1
the @entity15 researchers said that bullying at home is a ‘ hidden problem ’ – and one that victims find hard to escape			1
a study led by @entity20 found those who were regularly bullied by a sibling were more likely to be depressed or take an overdose in their teens ( stoke image ) they said parents must be aware that the phenomenon is n’t confined to the playground			1
some 3,500 children aged 12 were asked if they had been bullied by sibling and , if so , how often it happened			1
bullying involved more than simple teasing			2
the definition included deliberate nasty and hurtful remarks and being ignored and ostracised , as well as being kicked and pushed and being the subject of rumours and lies			0
six years later , aged 18 , the same youngsters answered questions about their feelings			0
they were also asked if they had ever self - harmed by taking an overdose or cutting themselves			2
almost 800 said they had been bullied several times a week when young			0
these young men and women were twice as likely as those to be clinically depressed as young adults as those who had n’t been tormented by a sibling			1
they were also twice as likely to say they had self - harmed within the previous year compared with those who had not been bullied			0
if the figures were extrapolated , sibling bullying could account for 13 per cent of depression and 19 per cent of self - harm among 18 - year - olds , the journal @entity52 reports			1
the study also found girls more likely to be victims than boys – with big brothers often the perpetrators			2
the study found big brothers were often the perpetrators and girls were most likely to be victims ( stock image ) lead author dr @entity67 , from the @entity20 , said : ‘ forms of bullying where victims are shoved around the playground or targeted at work have been well documented , however , this study uncovers a largely hidden form of bullying			1
‘ victims of sibling bullying are offered little escape as sibling relationships endure throughout development			2
‘ we are not talking about the sort of teasing that often goes on within families , but incidents that occur several times a week , in which victims are ignored by their brothers or sisters , or are subjected to verbal or physical violence			0
’ co-author professor @entity86 , of the @entity87 , said : ‘ it is important that parents set clear rules about what is allowed in conflicts and they should intervene consistently when their children maltreat each other repeatedly			0
’ @entity95 , chief executive of charity @entity96 said : ‘ being bullied as a child can have a devastating effect which lasts a lifetime			0
‘ parents who are concerned about this issue should speak to their children as early as possible before the problem escalates			0
‘ it 's important to tackle the underlying issues behind more frequent bullying behaviour rather than dismissing it as normal sibling rivalry			2
