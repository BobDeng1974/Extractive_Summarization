but after a long and faithful companionship , @entity9 may finally be about to call time on his relationship with his beloved @entity5 for a younger model ... a touch - screen @entity22 smartphone			1
the military unit responsible for @entity10 communications is testing a batch of new handsets for use by government staff , it was revealed today			1
and one of the most likely replacements is an @entity22 smartphone such as the @entity34 with beefed - up security to better cater for the @entity14 president 's phone and web - browsing needs			1
' we can confirm that the @entity43 , consistent with the rest of the @entity41 , is piloting and using a variety of mobile devices , ' a @entity41 spokesman told the @entity47			0
he declined to comment on the devices in the pilot test or in use at the @entity10			1
but the suggestion that @entity9 may have fallen out of love with his @entity5 months ago when it was revealed in december he had asked if he could switch to an @entity54 but was turned down amid ' security concerns '			1
however , his dream of using an @entity54 for his voicecall and web - browsing needs will remain unfulfilled after it was revealed the @entity10 is only testing phones from @entity34 and @entity61 , which both run on @entity64 ’s @entity22 operating system			1
he is still , however , allowed an @entity65 for reading , a source confirmed			0
a @entity34 spokesman declined to comment on whether its phones were being tested at the @entity10			2
' we have seen strong interest from the government sector and are working closely with various agencies to deploy pilot programs , ' he said			0
government orders have long bolstered @entity5 ’s revenue , but as the company ’s market share continues to wane , those contracts are becoming harder to secure in spite of @entity5 's best efforts			0
true love : after years of faithful companionship , the @entity14 president may finally be about to call time on his relationship with the button - laden @entity5 ( pictured together with wife @entity89 in 2011 ) ceo @entity91 held talks with the @entity10 earlier this month in a bid to shore up support for the smartphone through the @entity14 corridors of power , @entity90 reported			1
@entity5 shared closed down 1.3 per cent yesterday on the @entity97 , trading at $ 10.61			0
the company laid off more than 30 per cent of its employees last autumn after posting nearly $ 1 billion in losses			0
in 2009 , @entity10 press secretary @entity101 said a compromise had been reached to allow the president to use the @entity5 to keep in touch with senior staff and some personal friends			1
he did not say with whom the compromise had been struck			0
@entity101 said @entity9 will limit its use , and that security has been enhanced to protect his communications			2
downfall ? the @entity5 ( left ) has seen its share of the mobile phone market dwindle in recent years while @entity22 phones , such as the @entity34 ( right ) , have enjoyed a surge in popularity trouble ahead : @entity5 shares closed down 1.3 per cent yesterday on the @entity97 , trading at $ 10.61 previous presidents chose not to use e-mail because it can be subpoenaed by @entity120 and the courts , and may be subject to public records laws			2
@entity101 said the presumption from the @entity10 counsel 's office is that the e-mails will be subject to the @entity127 , which requires the @entity128 to preserve presidential records			2
but he also said some exemptions in the law allow for ' strictly personal communications			0
' he did not say how that classification would be determined , but made clear that the device could be used for both business and personal exchanges			0
@entity9 's @entity5 has been a constant companion , and he had noted publicly that he was negotiating to find a way to keep it despite security concerns and records - keeping issues			1
@entity101 said that @entity9 believes using the device will help him escape the ' bubble ' that surrounds the president .			2

@entity9 had to fight for his *blackberry* when he entered @entity10
