aid agencies have warned that sickening pictures of tortured corpses - allegedly victims of ' systematic killing ' in @entity6 jails - are just the tip of the iceberg			0
the shocking images , smuggled out of the country by a military police photographer , were described as ' clear evidence ' of crimes against humanity by a team of war crimes prosecutors			1
they show emaciated corpses with strangulation marks , cuts , bruising and signs of electrocution – evidence of extreme torture , claim investigators			1
some victims had no eyes			0
photographs : the report leverage : a report into alleged human rights abuses in @entity6 was made available to the @entity42 , governments and human rights groups just as peace talks are due to begin in @entity46 to try to end the three - year conflict and today foreign secretary @entity48 , as well as the @entity50 government , condemned the crimes shown in the photographs , and demanded that the perpetrators be brought to justice			1
mr @entity48 described the images as ' compelling and horrific ' , and said : ' it is important those who have perpetrated these crimes are one day held to account			1
' a spokesman from the @entity60 said : ' these reports suggest widespread and apparently systematic violations by the regime			0
these most recent images ... are extremely disturbing			2
they 're horrible to look at			0
' sir @entity66 , one of the lawyers who compiled a report on the credibility of the images , said that the evidence ' documented industrial - scale killing			1
' he pointed out that because the images purport to come from just one part of @entity6 , the human rights abuses could be much more widespread			1
‘ this is a smoking gun of a kind we did n’t have before			0
it makes a very strong case indeed , ’ he said			0
‘ it is the tip of the iceberg because this is 11,000 in just one area			0
' @entity37 denies the claims , insisting he is fighting terrorists , while a @entity6 government spokesman questioned whether the images were even taken in @entity6			1
the 31 - page report - released by @entity91 and @entity92 - was commissioned by @entity94 solicitors in @entity95 on behalf of the @entity97 government , which supports the @entity6 uprising			1
the dossier is being made available to the @entity42 , governments and human rights groups just as peace talks are due to begin in @entity46 tomorrow to try to end the three - year conflict			1
evidence supplied by the defector records deaths of those in custody from march 2011 until august 2013			1
the photos were smuggled out along with files detailing the victims on memory sticks			2
the images have drawn condemnation from international aid groups as well			2
graphic : the defector 's evidence , which records deaths of those in custody from march 2011 until august 2013 , were smuggled out along with files detailing the victims on memory sticks dossier of evidence : the photos will ratchet up the pressure on president @entity37 who the @entity50 and its @entity129 allies - including the @entity130 - say has committed war crimes against his own people allegations : the photographs allowed a death certificate to be produced without requiring families to view bodies , and also confirmed that execution orders had been carried out , the report claimed @entity140 , the director of @entity141 in the @entity142 , said : ' @entity143 must demand that the @entity144 and other human rights bodies be granted immediate access to all places of detention – formal and informal – in @entity6			1
' the allegations are consistent with aspects of @entity141 ’s own research into torture and enforced disappearance by the @entity6 government and must be taken seriously			2
' if confirmed , these would be crimes against humanity committed on a staggering scale			2
it certainly raises the question once again why the @entity160 has not yet referred the situation in @entity6 to the @entity162			0
' ' the report raises serious concerns over the safety of the thousands of individuals , including peaceful activists , currently held in state - run detention centres and those subjected to enforced disappearance			2
' today 's report was compiled by three lawyers , all former prosecutors at the criminal tribunals for the former @entity174 and @entity175 , examined the evidence and said they found the defector , who goes by the name of @entity180 , credible			1
according to the report , he said his job was to take pictures of killed detainees , though he did not claim to have witnessed executions or torture			1
‘ there could be as many as 50 bodies a day to photograph which require 15 to 30 minutes of work per corpse , ’ he told an inquiry team			0
the photographs allowed a death certificate to be produced without requiring families to view bodies , and also confirmed that execution orders had been carried out , he claimed			2
families of the dead were told cause of death was either a heart attack or breathing problems			0
the inquiry team said it was satisfied there was ‘ clear evidence , capable of being believed by a tribunal of fact in a court of law , of systematic torture and killing of detained persons by the agents of the @entity6 government ’			1
horrific : the inquiry team said it was satisfied there was ' clear evidence , capable of being believed by a tribunal of fact in a court of law , of systematic torture and killing of persons detained by the @entity6 government ' documenting death : @entity180 said his job was to take pictures of killed detainees , but did not claim to have witnessed executions or torture the evidence would ‘ support findings of crimes against humanity and could also support findings of war crimes ’			1
@entity180 's path to defection began in september 2011 , around seven months after the conflict broke out , when he was contacted by a relative who had fled the country			2
the man - known as ' @entity180 's contact ' - was working for ' international human rights groups ' , according to the report			0
@entity180 began sending him thousands of images , but soon became concerned for his safety , so the @entity6 opposition arranged for him and his family to be smuggled out of the country			0
their location has not been revealed , with the lawyers only saying they conducted their investigation in the @entity142			0
it is also not clear how the @entity97 regime came to be involved in the publication of the report			1
@entity97 has carved an influential role in @entity6 by being quick to help the rebels and , later , by helping set up the @entity261 a year ago with the aim of creating a credible alternative to @entity37			1
defector : @entity180 began sending him thousands of images , but soon became concerned for his safety , so the @entity6 opposition arranged for him and his family to be smuggled out of the country evidence of strangulation : a picture which appears to show a ligature mark on a corpse 's neck @entity97 and @entity273 are close allies in many respects			1
as @entity277 , they share an interest in thwarting @entity281 , @entity280 @entity279 and its @entity283 allies - @entity281 in @entity284 and @entity285 and @entity37 's @entity286			1
last year , however , @entity97 found itself under pressure from @entity273 and from the @entity50 over the way the war was going , and notably over the rising influence on the frontlines of @entity292 hostile to the @entity293 and to its allies in the @entity142 - like the @entity273 royal house			1
an expansion of the @entity261 to 120 seats diluted @entity97 control and handed leadership to the @entity273 - backed @entity300			1
on the ground , however , @entity97 is still a force , through groups like @entity304 , part of a new @entity305 that controls large areas and coordinates with the @entity308 - linked @entity307			2
a @entity310 source with knowledge of @entity97 policy said the new emir , in power since june , wanted a lower profile than his father who had strongly backed the @entity283 revolts			2
the new emir was also more open to @entity129 requests to stop supporting militants , though @entity97 still believed that arming rebels was needed to force @entity37 to compromise , however , the source said			1
the report 's authors are sir @entity66 , former chief prosecutor of the special court for @entity175 , sir @entity326 , the former lead prosecutor of former @entity328 president @entity327 , and professor @entity329 , who indicted president @entity330 of @entity331 at the @entity175 court			0
tension : an inquiry team said the images were ' clear evidence ... of systematic torture and killing of detained persons by the agents of the @entity6 government '			1
president @entity37 , pictured , denies the claims the @entity6 regime has also funded and co-operated with @entity308 in a complex double game - even as the terrorists fight @entity348 , it was claimed last night			2
western intelligence agencies , anti-rebels and @entity308 defectors claim two @entity308 affiliates operating in @entity6 have both been financed by selling oil and gas to and through the regime from wells under their control			0
rebels and defectors said the regime also deliberately released militant prisoners to strengthen jihadist ranks at the expense of moderate rebel forces			0
the aim was to persuade the @entity293 that the uprising was sponsored by @entity368 militants including @entity308 as a way of stopping @entity129 support for it , the intelligence report claims			0
doubt remains over whether @entity37 will attend tomorrow 's @entity374 conference in the @entity46 resort of @entity376 which is aimed at negotiating his exit from power			2
but in an interview released yesterday , @entity37 said there was a ' significant ' chance he will seek a new term			2
he also ruled out any power - sharing deal with the opposition which he dismissed as having been ' created ' by foreign backers			0
and he called for the peace talks to focus on what he termed his ' war against terrorism '			0
meanwhile , @entity390 's foreign minister says that the @entity42 decision to rescind the invitation to @entity279 to join the peace talks was a mistake but not a catastrophe			0
@entity396 said tuesday that @entity42 secretary general @entity398 's decision to withdraw his last - minute offer to @entity279 to attend the conference would have a negative impact on the @entity42 image			0
the @entity37 regime last night sought to distance itself from the photographs , and questioned their authenticity			1
@entity407 , from the @entity6 @entity408 , said there was no evidence they were taken in @entity6			0
he told the @entity412 : ‘ i doubt this report			0
we should check these photos			0
who are these people ? where are the names ? from which prisons ? who is this person who has the authority to have these photos ? ’ he added that he was ‘ astonished ’ at the figure of 11,000 victims , saying it had not been raised before .			0

warning : @entity426
witness said he was tasked to record deaths in custody from 2011 to 2013
there are 55,000 photos which lawyers say are evidence of extreme torture
report made by *ex-war* crimes prosecutors who deem witness ' credible '
one lawyer said abuses are likely to be even more extensive
foreign secretary said the images are ' compelling and horrific '
dossier commissioned by @entity130 lawyers for @entity97 which supports rebels
@entity37 regimes questioned the authenticity of the photographs
