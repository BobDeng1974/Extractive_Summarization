by @entity0 published : 04:04 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 14:45 est , 31 july 2013 a 50 - year - old @entity1 senator is the best - looking person in @entity3 politics , according to the latest edition of an annual list naming the capital 's hottest residents			1
@entity8 , from @entity9 , beat a number of younger contenders including @entity13 's goddaughter @entity14 to clinch the top spot in @entity18 's ' @entity17 ' list , which was released today			1
but overall it was the democrats who triumphed in this year 's rankings , taking 26 places on the list compared to 16 for the @entity1			1
as well as high - profile senators , congressmen and tv anchors , junior employees working in the legislative and executive branches are also eligible for the honour			0
just over half those named to the list - which was evenly split between men and women - were @entity71 , with 16 republicans and eight who are not affiliated to any party			1
however , this dominance is more likely to be due to the larger number of @entity71 currently working in the capital , with the party controlling the @entity79 and the @entity80			2
runners - up : @entity83 congressman @entity82 , left , and @entity79 chef @entity84 , right , came in sixth and third place respectively @entity86 : @entity87 and @entity88 of @entity89 are the first pair of twins the list , in fourth and fifth place 1 ) @entity8 , 50 , @entity9 senator 2 ) @entity14 , 27 , @entity94 3 ) @entity84 , 33 , @entity79 chef 4 ) @entity96 , 24 , @entity89 5 ) @entity88 , 24 , @entity89 6 ) @entity82 , 32 , @entity83 congressman 7 ) @entity97 , 26 , congressional aide 8 ) @entity99 , 30 , @entity1 strategist 9 ) @entity101 , 27 , congressional aide 10 ) @entity103 , 28 , @entity104 among the @entity71 lawmakers to make the list are 32 - year - old @entity82 of @entity83 in sixth place , dashing @entity109 @entity108 , and @entity111 's 70 - year - old congressman @entity110			1
in the @entity80 , by contrast , it seems to be freshmen from the @entity1 who are capturing observers ' hearts			2
mr @entity8 , elected last year to represent @entity9 , and @entity119 's @entity118 , the first @entity120 to represent the state for more than a century , both made it on to the list			1
number one pick mr @entity8 is known for looking younger than his 50 years , which he attributes to a healthy lifestyle , and also for his efforts in pushing immigration reform			2
he is a devout @entity129 , meaning he has never consumed alcohol , tobacco , coffee or tea - although he admits to having a weakness for ice cream and @entity135			0

less high - profile figures from the world of tv to make the list include @entity157 and @entity158 of @entity159 , while @entity87 and @entity88 , production assistants at @entity89 , are the first pair of identical twins ever to receive the accolade , placing fourth and fifth respectively			0
@entity79 nutrition adviser @entity84 will surely be one of the most sought - after names on the list - in addition to the good looks which propelled him to number three , he is an experienced professional chef			2
other heartthrobs who have caught the eye of their @entity3 colleagues include @entity172 , the daughter of @entity46 's @entity45 and @entity13 's goddaughter , who works at the @entity94 , and @entity176 , son of @entity178 pop star @entity177			0

' we 're extraordinarily proud to mark a decade of what 's become a mainstay for @entity3 and political enthusiasts , and look forward to 10 more years			0
