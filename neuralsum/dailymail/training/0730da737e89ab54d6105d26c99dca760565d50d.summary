president @entity0 leveled a new round of sanctions against @entity3 on tuesday , responding to president @entity5 's refusal to back down from his military interventions in eastern @entity7			1
@entity0 told reporters at the @entity9 that @entity3 is ' isolating itself from the international community , setting back decades of genuine process			2
' ' @entity3 is once again isolating itself from the international community , setting back decades of progress , ' he said minutes later			0
' it does n't have to be this way			0
this is a choice that @entity3 and president @entity5 in particular have made			2
' @entity0 said he does n't see his administration 's several rounds of economic sanctions against @entity22 as a new 1980s - style standoff			1
' no , it 's not a new @entity26 , ' the president said , responding to a question from @entity28			2
' the @entity29 means what it says ' : @entity0 spoke on the @entity31 of the @entity9 on tuesday , announcing new economic sanctions against key sectors of the @entity3 economy in the latest move to force @entity3 president @entity5 to end his support for @entity7 rebels ' @entity3 continues to support the separatists ... and train them , and arm them , ' he said , adding that @entity29 satellite surveillance has documented @entity3 forces launching artillery strikes directly into @entity7			1
' today is a reminder that the @entity29 means what it says			0
' the sanctions include a wide range of targeted moves aimed at banks , defense contractors and @entity5 ' cronies and oligarchs , ' a senior administration official said tuesday			1
and ' today we have expanded the list of financial institutions ' under sanctions ' to include three additional major @entity3 - owned banks			1
' ' there need to be greater costs imposed on @entity3 , ' the official said , in response to ' the flow of heavy weapons and support we 've seen from @entity3 into @entity7 in the last couple of weeks			1
' @entity3 is backing the separatist movement whose soldiers shot down a @entity71 passenger jet last week			0
@entity0 complained that @entity5 's government has blocked international inspectors from viewing the entirety of the crash scene			2
the @entity29 president devoted most of his 10 minutes of remarks to underscoring his administration 's hope that @entity5 will buckle under the weight of financial penalties , and withdraw from @entity7			1
' the main tool that we have to influence @entity3 behavior ... is the impact they 're having on its economy , ' he said			0
@entity0 dodged a reporter 's question , however , about whether the @entity29 will step in and arm the @entity7 government			1
' are you considering lethal aide to @entity7 ? ' came the question			0
' the issue is not the ability of the @entity7 military to outfight the separatists , ' @entity0 replied			0
he also noted a new round of sanctions from the @entity101 , calculated to emphasize @entity103 's preference for @entity7 over @entity104			0
standing alone ? @entity3 president @entity5 has maed his nation ' more isolated than at any time since the end of the @entity26 , ' a senior @entity0 administration official told reporters on tuesday those sanctions , announced hours before @entity0 spoke in @entity111 , include limits on capital market access for @entity3 state banks , an arms trade embargo and restrictions on the export of sensitive technologies to @entity3 oil companies â€“ including foreign companies engaged in @entity3 's petroleum markets			1
@entity0 's announcement came in conjunction with a series of @entity101 sanctions targeting banks , defense contractors and the oil industry in @entity3 ' it is meant as a strong warning , ' a statement from the @entity130 read : ' illegal annexation of territory and deliberate destabilization of a neighboring sovereign country can not be accepted in 21st century @entity103			1
' @entity0 highlighted the degree to which @entity3 's annexation of the @entity138 , and its continued arming of rebels there , has exposed @entity5 to consequences all across @entity103			1
' it 's hard to avoid the spillover of what 's happening in eastern @entity7 from affecting @entity103 across the board , ' @entity0 said			2
a second senior administration official said after the president boarded @entity148 on the @entity31 of the @entity9 that ' the @entity101 's steps are strong , they are significant , and they represent a new step for @entity103 ...			0
that we have taken together , ' ' that is very similar to what we have done			0
' ' @entity3 is not a very good bet right now for international investors , ' added a third official			0
asked what the administration expected @entity5 to do , he rattled off a list of expectations			0
' there still is an off - ramp available to @entity3 and president @entity5 , ' the official told reporters during a conference call			2
that would require @entity22 to recognize the legitimacy of @entity7 's newly elected government , stop the flow of arms across the @entity3 - @entity7 border , abandon its troop buildup there , and persuade rebels to enter a diplomatic dialogue			1
' we will continue to hold that door open , ' he said .			0

economic penalties will hit state - owned banks , @entity5 ' cronies and oligarchs , ' defense contractors and @entity3 's oil industry
@entity0 wants @entity22 to *reverse* its troop building on the @entity7 border , stop the flow of arms and bring @entity7 rebels to the *negotiating* table
he *insists* that @entity111 is n't entering a new @entity26 period with @entity3
@entity0 also deflected a question about whether the @entity29 will help arm @entity7 defending against the rebels who shot down @entity198 last week
