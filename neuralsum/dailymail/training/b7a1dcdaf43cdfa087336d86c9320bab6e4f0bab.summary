sadistic @entity0 was believed to have been executed in a filmed hanging but now historians say it was a different @entity3 butcher revelations about the execution of a notorious @entity3 war criminal , immortalised in @entity9 , have raised questions about how the mass murderer died and whether he was even hanged at all			1
for decades @entity0 , who was responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of @entity13 and @entity14 during @entity15 , was believed to have been filmed being executed in 1946			1
a black and white video shows executioners twice botching a hanging before he was eventually killed			1
but historians claim in a new @entity21 documentary called @entity22 that the video was from 1947 and shows dr @entity24 being hanged			1
worryingly , there is almost no detail about the sadistic mass murderer 's death in official records and no one knows what happened to his body			2
historian dr @entity33 and presenter @entity34 do not believe he escaped @entity35 like other high profile @entity36 such as @entity38 and @entity39 , and say he was killed			1
however the revelations surrounding @entity0 , who was known to carry out his own killings rather than order them , mean his death is now a complete mystery with records containing just two words : ' he died			1
' dr @entity33 said : ' we are pretty sure that he was executed			2
on some level there will be speculation but if it was a court of law it would be concluded beyond reasonable doubt			0
' he was a truly horrific individual			0
@entity70 , documentary director , said a combination of inaccurate records and the internet has perpetuated the myth that @entity0 was in the video of the execution			1
he said : ' we know he was executed and there was one unconfirmed account that said the executioners struggled because of @entity0 's height			1
' there is no record of where he was buried , he could have been cremated and had his ashes thrown in the river or his body could have been donated to a medical school			2
we just do n't know			0
' with @entity0 , he acted alone so we thought there may be records and reports of his death but there is nothing			1
the only record left about the execution of @entity0 , who enjoyed killing people himself rather than ordering their deaths , is a note saying ' he died ' ' he actually killed people himself , the war helped him exact his psychopathic tendencies			1
' @entity0 was chillingly portrayed by @entity103 actor @entity102 in the @entity106 's @entity105 - winning masterpiece @entity9			1
the @entity109 , the @entity110 in @entity111 , @entity0 's biographer and numerous online holocaust sites identified the man being hanged as @entity0			1
@entity0 , the @entity115 - @entity114 concentration camp commander in @entity14 , was convicted of killing tens of thousands of @entity13 in 1946			1
he was known to shoot babies for fun and got an extra kick when victims died slowly and painfully			0
@entity0 was chillingly played by @entity102 in the @entity105 - winning classic @entity9 in 1993 in @entity9 @entity102 ' @entity0 is seen being hanged , pictured , after giving a @entity3 salute but historians say very little is known about the actual execution and what then happened to the body as well as killing @entity13 and @entity14 , @entity0 also stole from them for his personal gain			1
at his trial he was found guilty of ordering up to 8,000 inmates to be exterminated , killing 2,000 more by closing the @entity130 ghetto , and ordering the murder of several thousands more by closing down the forced labour camp at @entity133			1
survivors told of the horror of living under @entity0 's command and testimonies said that he took a personal interest in the murder of prisoners			1
he would often set dogs on prisoners , who would eat them alive , before @entity0 personally shot them but only when they stopped moving			2
prisoners were counted lucky if they survived for more than four weeks			0
in 1943 on @entity146 , @entity0 and @entity147 officers shot 50 @entity13 and prisoners were regularly hanged in front of others			2
@entity152 's testimony at the trial of war criminal @entity38 is quoted on the @entity156 website : ' the case of @entity158 , whose daughter lives in @entity160 , and i know her			0
. he was summoned by the @entity163 commandant @entity0			2
' @entity164 had two dogs , @entity166 and @entity167 , and he set the dogs on him			0
the dogs ate him up alive			0
possibly a little breath still remained in him			0
he shot him and he was killed			2
' in another testimony , an older man received a beating and was then made to thank @entity0 for it			2
when he turned to leave , he was shot in the back			0
at @entity114 , @entity0 spent the mornings using a high - powered rifle to shoot children playing in the camp			1
documentary film director @entity70 said @entity0 , portrayed here by @entity102 , has been ' slightly forgotten ' @entity181 said : ' when you saw @entity0 , you saw death			1
' @entity0 was arrested by the @entity184 for theft in 1944 but charges were dropped as @entity59 faced defeat by the @entity188			2
he was arrested again in 1945 , this time by @entity190 forces and put on trial in 1946 at the @entity192 in @entity130			0
@entity0 was found guilty on september 5 , 1946 and executed on the 13			2
mr @entity193 added : ' the prison record only says two words : " he died "			0
the @entity14 archives have been 80 per cent sure that it was him			0
' we knew the @entity199 had the original film and when we went to them they said the film on the internet was theirs and they were 80 per cent sure it was @entity0			1
' when you think about the end of the war , @entity14 was a mess			0
' they were n't terribly concerned by the accuracy of the records so the video may have just been dumped on a table and mislabeled			0
' the clip was later used in a documentary about @entity0 and uploaded to @entity216 and it has all perpetuated the myth			1
' people in @entity130 are aware of @entity0 but he has slightly been forgotten			1
' @entity9 gave us a hero and a villain , but without remembering the villain we can forget the hero and what he fought against			0
' in @entity106 's 1993 masterpiece @entity9 , @entity0 was played by @entity102 - winning a @entity226 for best supporting actor			1
@entity229 ' portrayal led to @entity0 being named as the 15th biggest villain in movie history by the @entity232			2
@entity233 , played by @entity234 , was named 15th top hero			0
historians believe the video of the botched execution actually shows dr @entity24 dr @entity24 was a @entity3 lawyer , politician and war criminal , who was responsible for creating the @entity241			1
born into a @entity243 family , he joined the @entity244 in 1926 and rose to the senior rank of @entity246			0
he was elected to the @entity247 in 1937 - two years before the outbreak of @entity15			0
after the invasion of @entity14 in 1939 , @entity249 was appointed governor of the @entity252 and held the position until the withdrawal of @entity59 forces in january 1945			0
@entity249 issues anti-semitic laws and was responsible for mass executions , slave labour programmes and sending @entity14 @entity13 to concentration camps			0
he survived an attempted assassination attempt in 1944 before the @entity262 and was arrested a year later by the @entity188 forces and handed over the the @entity265 authorities			0
he was tried before the @entity192 and sentenced to death			0
