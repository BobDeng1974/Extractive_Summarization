by @entity0 last updated at 6:43 pm on 10th august 2011 if you look out of your kitchen window today and see a giant inflatable island floating towards your home - do n't worry , aliens are not about to land and you 're not going mad			2
you 've probably just found a runaway sculpture inflated with helium which a couple of tipsy revellers released when it was moored at @entity12 's @entity11			1
the £ 12,000 @entity13 , had been bobbing around in the sky to inspire party - goers having been built to represent the " slightly modified reality "			1
missing : the £ 12,000 @entity13 , had been bobbing around in the sky to inspire party - goers at the @entity19 however , around 3am on sunday , july 24 two youths were spotted crossing the lake in a dinghy under the cover of darkness , who then promptly cut all five of its tether ropes and watched it sail away into the night sky			1
now a man - hunt has been launched to track down the seven - metre wide sculpture - created by @entity32 graduates @entity33 and @entity34			2
data from the @entity37 @entity36 has predicted the inflatable land mass could now be as far as @entity39 , according to @entity41 - over the town of @entity42 in fact - although organisers of the event hope it is still in the @entity46			2
the island is due to be on display in the @entity37 at this year 's @entity50 festival in the @entity52 desert , pictured , later on this month it was last seen over @entity54 , @entity12 , 400 metres up - but no one from any of @entity46 's airports have spotted the unusual airborne art piece			1
some residents claim to have seen it in @entity60 - and one woman thought it was the @entity64 - whilst others thought extra-terrestrial life was about to touch down			0
a statement on the organisers ' website said : ' the @entity46 @entity71 , local airports as well as chartered air spaces were informed , and attempts have been made to calculate the wind speed and direction around @entity54 , @entity12 at the time of its release , any more accurate location updates will be published			1
under construction : the island is made of durable polyurethane , and is covered in green foliage ' however due to there being release valves on the balloon , the helium will have been slowly expelled over a long period of time , as opposed to rising quickly and rupturing , meaning the island could have reached great heights			0
' but what goes up must come down , so the hunt is on			0
if what looks like a floating chunk of earth turns up in your @entity95 ’s back garden , or if you think you see a new planet on your @entity100 flight to @entity101 , please do n’t hesitate to get in touch			0
' made of durable polyurethane , and covered in green foliage , organisers are desperate for it to be located - it has a date in the @entity37 at this year 's @entity50 festival in the @entity52 desert later on this month			1
into the ether : the sculpture floated off from the festival - and could be in @entity39			0
the festival attracts around 26,000 visitors the creation took six months to make - in @entity114 in @entity115			0
about 26,000 visitors flocked from across the @entity46 to the @entity11			1
the festival started in 2004 when just 1,000 people attended			0
the event takes place in the grounds of a country house in the village of @entity124 , near @entity54 and the lake becomes the centre stage for various sculptures and other art pieces			2
any sightings should be reported via is - land.co.uk			0

£ 12,000 art piece was released from its tethers by *vandals* at @entity12 's @entity11
