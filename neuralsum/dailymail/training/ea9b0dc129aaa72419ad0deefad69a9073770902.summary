@entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 ... do you really know how to pronounce these places ? it seems there are some place names that even the most well - travelled of us fail to say correctly , some exotic , some closer to home			1
who knew that the correct way to say @entity12 was ' @entity13 ' ? or that the best way to say @entity15 is ' @entity16 ' ? @entity17 , professor of phonetics at @entity19 and author of @entity21 on @entity22 and general phonetics , told @entity24 : ' the problems derive mainly from the opaqueness of @entity22 spelling , which does not enable us to predict pronunciation with any certainty , and also from people 's disinclination to study foreign languages			1
the ' ph ' is actually pronounced ' p ' rather than ' f ' , while the hard ' k ' is more like a ' g ' sound			2
for an @entity22 tongue ' pu - get ' is about as close as you will get to the proper pronunciation			1
@entity15 @entity39 's capital city is a popular haunt for @entity47 abroad , but how many are pronouncing it correctly ? the ' a ' is more of an ' ah ' sound , while the ' k ' is harder , again , like a ' g ' and the ' o ' should be said ' aw ' , making the correct pronunciation more like " @entity50 - gawk "			1
the stunning @entity39 island of @entity0 is a favourite with holidaymakers , but do we pronounce it correctly ? @entity1 @entity55 may be one of our favourite long - haul destinations , but it seems we ca n't pronounce one of their most famous cities			1
@entity1 , often pronounced ' @entity61 - born ' is called ' melb'n ' by the folks who live there			1
and while we 're at it , let 's get @entity66 right too , it is pronounced ' brisb'n '			0
@entity2 fancy a bargain ? @entity68 to @entity69 , an oasis of budget shopping in one of @entity74 's fastest growing towns			0
that 's ' @entity76 ' to you and me			0
@entity79 , @entity80 do n't be fooled by the @entity81 , the way to say this beautiful @entity80 state , is ' @entity84 - ha - ca '			1
yes , just like the @entity86 @entity80 restaurant chain			0
she clearly could n't trust us to pronounce the name correctly without a phonetic spelling to help us out			0
if you want to enjoy the delights of @entity55 's cultural hub @entity1 , make sure you also pronounce it the way the locals do the former @entity47 colony of @entity98 in the @entity99 is pronounced ' dommi - neeka ' @entity100 the @entity102 county of @entity100 has plenty to offer visitors , from beautiful @entity105 to the @entity107 's @entity106 , a late 14th - century moated manor house			1
but first you 'll need to be able to tell people where you are going			0
it may be tempting to pronounce all @entity22 counties ending in ' shire ' as if you are a @entity113 , but it is actually a softer ' sheer ' pronunciation you need			0
forget the ' r ' and the ' c ' and instead blend the word to say ' wuster '			0
and so you have the county ' wustersheer '			0
a recent survey revealed that 82 per cent of us regularly trip over our words			0
and place names can be particularly confusing , according to the study commissioned by @entity126 railway station @entity125 , which is itself frequently mispronounced by 33 per cent of people to sound like the gland ' pancreas '			1
it found the @entity132 city of ' @entity133 ' is the most commonly mispronounced word , with more than half of @entity136 ( 59 per cent ) getting it wrong ( it 's pronounced ' ee - lee ' not ' ee - lie '			1
and one in six ( 16 per cent ) speakers do not pronounce the south - east @entity126 district of ' @entity139 ' correctly			1
it should be pronounced ' gren - ich ' , not as it is seen			2
@entity142 a small but lively @entity145 town right in @entity146 in @entity147 , it sits beside the @entity148 and is surrounded by spectacular scenery			0
but just make sure that if you 're heading that way , you say ' king - yoossie ' , not ' kin - gussie '			2
@entity154 the capital of @entity156 in @entity157 and famed as the ' city of roses ' , @entity154 is often a stop - off for travellers crossing the country thanks to its handy central location			1
but if you 're heading that way , ask for directions to ' bloom - fontayn ' , not ' blohm - fon - tyne '			2
are you getting @entity170 , home to the beautiful city of @entity172 , confused with @entity175 university @entity173 ? @entity98 @entity98 , the former @entity176 in the @entity99 , is famed as an untouched corner of the @entity178 with beautiful scenery and amazing walks			0
and it 's pronounced ' dommi - neeka ' , not ' do - @entity182 '			2
@entity170 not to be confused with top @entity183 , @entity173 , the @entity185 country is actually pronounced ' col - ombia ' rather than ' @entity173 '			2
@entity187 is famous for its @entity189 heritage and for straddling the @entity190 ... and it is pronounced ' buda - pesht ' @entity191 it is one of the most beautiful cities in @entity195 , split down the middle as it straddles the @entity190 but connected through a series of elegant bridges			2
but if you 've been pronouncing it phonetically as you read the word , you 've been doing it wrong - the @entity204 capital is actually pronounced ' @entity205 '			1
@entity206 if you are in @entity126 and heading to the @entity207 , you 'll be viisting the @entity126 borough of @entity206			0
it 's well worth it			0
but if you 're asking for directions on the @entity212 , forget the ' l ' - this area of the capital , also famous for @entity216 recording studios and @entity217 , is actually pronounced ' ho - burn ' .			1

did you know that the correct way to say @entity12 was ' @entity13 ' ?
or that the best way to say @entity39 capital @entity15 is actually ' @entity224 - gawk ' ?
