it 's an old cartoon stereotype that has long felt outdated , but scientists think they may finally have evidence to justify the claim that women are more afraid of mice than men are			1
a new study suggests millions of experiments may have been ruined because rodents are ‘ stressed ’ by the smell of researchers - with a man 's scent far more distressing than that of a woman			1
this is likely to mean mice are less concerned about revealing their presence when a woman is around , and are more likely to confront a female than they are a man			1
a new study claims experiments with laboratory rats , which have been used for centuries , may be worthless because rats and mice are ' stressed ' by the smell of researchers , with the scent of man being more distressing than that of a woman			1
stock image pictured the study , conducted by @entity35 scientists at @entity36 in @entity37 , found that a researcher ’s gender can have a significant impact on tests of pain			1
stress blocks pain , which means that when a male lab technician is the room , a rat or mouse will feel far less pain than when a woman is conducting the experiment			1
the findings , published in the journal @entity53 , are significant for any experiment looking at the side effects of drugs or any test involving monitoring pain			2
some 95 per cent of all lab animals are mice and rats			1
psychology professor @entity61 , who conducted the study , said : ‘ scientists whisper to each other at conferences that their rodent research subjects appear to be aware of their presence , and that this might affect the results of experiments , but this has never been directly demonstrated until now			1
’ the study found that pheromones , which are secreted by men at higher concentrations than women , had a distinct impression on lab rodents			1
the chemical triggered a stress response in mice and rats equivalent to that caused by restraining the rodents for 15 minutes in a tube or forcing them to swim for three minutes			1
the study found that pheromones , which are secreted by men at higher concentrations than women , had a distinct impression on lab rodents			2
the researchers said the effects can be mitigated by staying in the room with the animal before testing , but the gender of the experimenter should be published alongside the research the study involved placing cotton t - shirts , worn the previous night by male or female experimenters , alongside the mice			2
the effects were identical to those caused by the presence of the scientists themselves			0
study leader professor @entity110 said : ‘ our findings suggest that one major reason for lack of replication of animal studies is the gender of the experimenter - a factor that ’s not currently stated in the methods sections of published papers			2
’ prof @entity61 added : ‘ the problem is easily solved by simple changes to experimental procedures			0
‘ for example , since the effect of males ’ presence diminishes over time , the male experimenter can stay in the room with the animals before starting testing			0
‘ at the very least , published papers should state the gender of the experimenter who performed the behavioural testing			0
’ scientists from the @entity137 replicated a casino environment by making rats gamble for sugar pellets using a slot machine - style device			2
it featured three flashing lights and two levers they could push with their paws			0
the rats responded to a series of three flashing lights before choosing between two levers			0
one combination of lights signaled a win and another combination signaled a loss			0
a ' cash - out ' lever rewarded the rat with 10 sugar pellets on winning trials , but gave a 10 - second ' time out ' penalty on losing trials			0
the ' roll again ' lever allowed the rats to begin a new trial without penalty , but provided no sugar pellets			0
interestingly , the rats showed a tendency towards choosing the cash - out lever when nearly getting the right combination suggesting that rats , like people , are susceptible to the the ' near - miss effect '			0
by blocking the @entity176 receptors with drugs , the researchers were successfully able to reduce the rat 's choice of the ' cash - out ' lever on non-winning trials .			0

laboratory rats have been used in scientific experiments for over a century
but @entity35 scientists say the results are *skewed* *due* to a hidden factor
study said rats are ' stressed ' by smell , and the scent of a man is more distressing than that of a woman
stress is known to block pain , which could significantly alter results
95 per cent of all lab animals used in experiments are rats and mice
