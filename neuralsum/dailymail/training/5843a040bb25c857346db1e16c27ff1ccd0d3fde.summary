by @entity0 the mother of murdered schoolboy @entity2 has slammed a decision to release the gangster who supplied his murder weapon - leaving just one of the seven - strong gang in prison			1
@entity2 was just 11 when he was gunned down by 16 - year - old @entity2 , aided by six others , on his way home from football practice in @entity13 , @entity14 , in 2007			1
but @entity15 - who supplied the @entity17 revolver used to kill the child - has walked free from jail this month to the outrage of @entity2 ' family			1
' horrendous ' : @entity15 ( left ) was one of seven people jailed over their involvement in the murder of schoolboy @entity2 ( right ) but he has now been released , leaving only murderer @entity2 behind bars murder weapon : @entity15 supplied the @entity17 revolver used to kill @entity2 it means only @entity2 , who was jailed for life with a minimum of 22 years , is left behind bars after seven people were convicted over their involvement in the horrific crime			1
@entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and a 16 - year - old who could not be named have all served their sentences			1
@entity41 ' mother @entity40 told the @entity42 : ' it 's terrible			0
it takes us back to the night @entity2 died			1
it seems like only yesterday that @entity15 was sent to jail			2
' he may not have pulled the trigger , but he was minding the gun			0
for us , @entity15 is the most evil of them all			0
he makes my skin crawl			0
' @entity15 was 21 when he was jailed for just seven years for supplying the gun used to kill @entity2 and helping @entity2 cover his tracks			1
he and two other members of the @entity57 , 18 , and @entity35 , 17 - winked , smiled , smirked and cheered in the bulletproof dock as they were handed sentences blasted as ' disgusting ' by @entity2 ' family			1
@entity2 ' mother @entity40 , pictured left with his father @entity61 , attacked the decision to release @entity15 the trial judge , mr @entity63 , told @entity15 : ' there is strong evidence you were an active gang member ' i have no doubt you were a willing assistant helping in any way you could			1
' @entity71 ' term was later increased to 12 years by the lord chief justice , who attacked the ' modern pestilence ' of gun crime			1
but because @entity15 spent almost a year in prison awaiting trial , that time counted towards his final sentence			1
baby - faced killer : @entity2 was jailed for life with a minimum of 22 years that means he has spent just over five years behind bars since being found guilty of assisting the schoolboy 's murderer			1
he has been released on licence midway through his sentence , as is commonplace , and will be monitored outside prison for the remainder of the 12 years			2
@entity2 died on august 22 , 2007 , when @entity2 , armed with a revolver , cycled to his estate to try to shoot members of the rival @entity93			2
@entity2 was struck by his second bullet , suffering terrible injuries			0
the ' wall of silence ' faced by police meant that while @entity2 's name swiftly emerged as the prime suspect in the shooting , months of painstaking detective work was required to charge him with murder			0
the gun itself , a .455 calibre @entity107 and @entity108 revolver with a six - inch barrel , may have been handed down through generations of @entity14 criminals			0
it was made during the @entity113 in about 1915 , but remained in good working order			0
the rifling in the barrel was worn and the bullets fired by @entity2 were slightly undersized , causing them to tumble end - over - end			2
that meant the round which hit @entity2 was side - on when it struck him in the back of the neck , splintering vertebrae and destroying his windpipe before exiting through his throat			2
the @entity124 also had an imitation @entity125 @entity127 converted to fire live rounds , a @entity130 revolver and a @entity132 7.62 handgun			0
murdered : @entity133 fan @entity2 , 11 , was gunned down on his was home from football practice in @entity14 a probation service spokesman told @entity138 he would not comment on individual cases			2
he added : ' public protection is our priority			0
serious offenders on licence are subject to strict conditions and can be recalled to prison if they breach them			0
' when released from prison , offenders managed through @entity149 ( @entity149 ) will be risk assessed , monitored and supervised by probation , police and other agencies			0

@entity15 spent just six years in jail *including* his time on remand
now *26* , he owned @entity160 gun used to kill schoolboy , 11
trial judge noted ' strong evidence *[* he *]* was an active gang member '
he smirked in the dock and cheered with *accomplices* at ' soft ' sentence
*original* seven - year sentence was later increased to 12 by @entity172 judge
@entity2 ' mother @entity174 said : ' it takes us back to night he died '
