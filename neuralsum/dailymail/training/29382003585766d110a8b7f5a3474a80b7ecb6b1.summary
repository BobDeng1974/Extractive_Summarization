@entity1 hunters in @entity2 are on the trail of 17 more former @entity5 guards who worked at the death camp of @entity7 in occupied @entity8 during the @entity9			1
four women are among the suspects said to have helped herd innocent victims into the gas chambers - or who were part of mass shooting parties - which claimed the lives of between 80,000 and 150,000 people , most of them @entity18			0
@entity7 was a hybrid facility which also served as a concentration camp and a source of slave labour			1
@entity7 ( above and below ) was a hybrid facility which also served as a concentration camp and a source of slave labour located on the outskirts of @entity28 in eastern @entity8 , it was liberated by the @entity29 in july 1944 and remains the best preserved @entity31 site with intact gas chambers and crematoria			1
@entity2 â€™s @entity34 for @entity35 recently tracked down several @entity37 camp guards in the country and handed files over to various regional prosecutors who are now mulling charges against them			2
@entity37 was first constructed to hold @entity8 political prisoners , who began to arrive in may 1940			2
the first extermination of prisoners took place in september 1941 @entity46 , the director of the agency based in @entity48 , wants to level charges of complicity in mass murder against the @entity7 guards			2
files on three of the suspects have already been handed to prosecutors with @entity46 admitting : ' the evidence is somewhat problematical			0
' by that he means that there remain no witnesses alive able to testify to the alleged crimes committed by the guards			0
but he hopes that the case of @entity66 will serve as the blueprint in any forthcoming trials			0
@entity66 was convicted of assisting in the mass murder of 28,000 @entity18 at the extermination camp of @entity71 , where 250,000 of the six million victims of the @entity31 were murdered			1
@entity66 ( in the wheelchair ) was convicted of war crimes without any evidence or testimony against him			1
judges decided that it was enough that he had served as a guard at @entity71 concentration camp			1
he died on march 17 , 2012 he was convicted in @entity81 in 2011 without a shred of testimony about what he did in the camp : judges ruled for the first time that it was enough for him to have have served there for him to be guilty of aiding the @entity91 in their criminal enterprise			0
@entity46 went on : ' @entity7 is a very complicated camp and for us because there were no demarcated areas for the killings as in other @entity1 camps			2
' indeed research is continuing at the site of the camp - now a memorial and museum - to try to ascertain the correct numbers of those murdered there			0
' we have little material , the information we have is not optimal , ' admitted @entity46 ,			0
age and infirmity could mean that some , perhaps all , of the @entity113 from @entity7 will not be brought to trial			0
of the recent @entity37 suspects rounded up with the help of the @entity1 hunters of the @entity118 in @entity119 , nine have been judged incapable of standing trial , four were let go because of lack of evidence , four more have since died , one was released because he had already served time for war crimes in @entity8 and 14 more cases are still being considered by public prosecutors across @entity2 .			1

@entity7 was a concentration camp on the outskirts of @entity28 in eastern @entity8 but also *provided* slave labour for the @entity2
it was liberated by the @entity133 @entity29 in july 1944
there are no *survivors* from the camp to testify
prosecutors hoping to use @entity66 *strategy* whereby the fact he worked at @entity71 was enough to convict him of war crimes
