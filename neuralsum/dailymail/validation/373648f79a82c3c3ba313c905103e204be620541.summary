@entity1 boss @entity0 has criticised @entity2 , claiming they should not be taking @entity3 on a 21,000 - mile post-season trek to @entity5 if they think he needs a rest			1
@entity3 gushed with pride on thursday after being rewarded for his fine form with a maiden @entity1 call - up			1
the 21 - year - old is in line to make his international debut against @entity14 on march 27 or in @entity15 four days later			1
@entity3 has been called into the @entity1 squad for the first time by @entity0 @entity3 is set to play for the under 21 side in summer ' it is an honour to be called up to the senior side , something i always dreamed of as a kid , ' @entity3 told @entity25			1
' i 'm excited , when i got the message i was going to be in i was full of joy and hopefully it is the first of many			0
' having started the season as @entity25 ' third - choice striker , few expected @entity3 to score 26 goals for the club			1
but now he is the club 's poster boy and , for that reason , the north londoners are determined to take him on their post-season jaunt to @entity5 , where they will play @entity39 in a friendly on may 30			1
@entity0 is not so keen on the idea , however			0
@entity3 will , more than likely , be included in the @entity43 squad for the @entity44 - which takes place from june 17 to june 30 - as @entity0 wants him to experience international tournament football			1
@entity48 's team will play at least one friendly between the end of the season ( may 24 ) and the start of the tournament on june 17			0
@entity0 has noted @entity54 's concerns about @entity3 's potential tiredness , but he thinks @entity25 have a perfect opportunity to rest the striker by leaving him out of the squad for the 42 - hour round trip to @entity5			1
' this is a marketing game as far as i can understand , ' the @entity1 manager said			2
' personally speaking , playing for @entity1 at under - 21 level at a tournament is more important than a friendly in @entity5			1
' i would be very hypocritical if i did n't give that answer			0
' if he needs a rest , there 's a great opportunity when the season ends before our under - 21s get together to give him a rest			0
' you ca n't expect me in good faith to say : ' oh no , i understand he should n't be resting for the @entity5 trip , he should be doing that and then resting when the under - 21s pitch up			2
' i ca n't go along with that			0
' having represented @entity25 across four competitions , @entity3 could amass well over 50 appearances for the club before the end of the season			2
and the @entity88 expects the forward to push himself to the extreme to impress @entity0			0
@entity54 will relay his concerns to @entity0 when @entity1 train at the club 's @entity94 base next week in the build - up to the two internationals			2
' i will see @entity54 , ' @entity0 said			0
' i do n't think it 's a problem there			0
do n't forget these decisions are sometimes commercial and taken out of a coach 's hands			0
' @entity54 will take his @entity2 side to @entity5 at the end of the season			2

@entity3 was called up to the @entity1 squad for the first time
he will join up with the side for matches against @entity14 and @entity15
but he is likely to go on a *pre-season* tour of @entity5 with his club
and @entity3 is set to play at the @entity116
