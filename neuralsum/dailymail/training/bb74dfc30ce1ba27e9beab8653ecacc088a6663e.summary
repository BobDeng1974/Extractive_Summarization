by @entity0 published : 20:47 est , 8 may 2013 updated : 07:44 est , 9 may 2013 @entity1 said last night that she would prefer to be given the death penalty rather than life in prison after she was yesterday found guilty of first degree murder			1
because of her emotional state , @entity7 is now on suicide watch as she awaits her sentencing hearing which begins today			1
' the worst outcome would be natural life because longevity runs in my family , ' she told @entity16			2
i would much rather die sooner rather than later because @entity29 runs in my family , and i do n't want to spend the rest of my natural life in one place			1
i 'm pretty healthy , i do n't smoke and i 'll probably live for a long time so that 's not something that i am looking forward to			2
' i believe death is the ultimate freedom and i 'd rather have my freedom as soon as i can get it			2
' the interview took place in a holding room inside the courthouse just 20 minutes after the verdict was rendered			0
and now , because of the suicidal comments she made in the interview as well as prior threats , police have put her under psychological watch to insure that she does not hurt herself while in court custody			1
the moment : @entity7 showed little reaction when the verdict was read welling up : @entity7 had tears in her eyes when she looked back at her family sitting behind her in the courtroom since she admitted that she killed @entity59 , there was no chance that she would have been found innocent , but the question of whether or not she planned the murder or whether it was committed as an act of self defense			1
today five members of the 12 - person jury found it was premeditated and the seven others found that it was both premeditated and a felony murder			1
' it was unexpected for me yes because there was no premeditation on my part , ' she said in the interview			0
' the whole time i was fairly confident that i would n't get premeditation because there was no premeditation			0
' she said that she would have understood if they simply found her guilty of felony murder ' because of the way that the law is written ' but also attributes some of her own actions that caused the jury not to believe her			1
' i can understand that because of the lies i told in the beginning , to try to cover this and hide that , ' @entity7 said			2
spectacle : court officials told the public that the verdict was going to be read three hours before it actually happened , giving followers time to gather outside of the @entity99 victory : crowds cheer when they heard @entity1 was convicted of first degree murder wednesday afternoon she took shots at prosecutor @entity105 , who she sparred with for weeks during her questioning			1
' prior to trial , i respected @entity105 as a capable attorney even though he ’s done some very shady things in my case as far as hiding evidence , ' she said in the @entity114 interview			0
' in the end what does it matter it does n’t help my case			0
' some of the hundreds of @entity59 supporters who gathered outside of the courtroom awaiting the verdict held posters praising @entity105 , one even suggesting he runs for governor of @entity123			0
@entity7 said that she was ' overwhelmed ' and ' went blank ' following the verdict , but showed little emotion			2
closure : the victim 's sisters @entity130 ( left ) and @entity131 ( right ) were visibly relieved she did not apologize to the @entity59 family , saying only that ' now that a verdict has been rendered that they can find peace , or some semblance of peace			0
' when asked what she would do if she were to go back to the moment when she was standing by her car in the desert with her hands covered in @entity59 's blood , she said that she would drive directly to the @entity145 , @entity123 police department			0
in the courtroom , she repeatedly said that she did not know what she would have done			0
though she has been separated from her original pod of cellmates , @entity7 said that she got a sense of how big the trial was getting when new inmates would enter the prison and seek her out			1
' they want to shake my hand , they want to give me a hug			0
they want my autograph - i 'm not going to sign anything , ' she said			0
@entity7 was originally scheduled to speak to @entity162 ’ @entity163 at 10pm on wednesday , but now that she is on suicide watch , she may not be able to grant media requests			1
the jurors will reconvene tomorrow to begin the two - part process of deciding whether or not she will receive the death penalty			2

found guilty of first degree murder and the jury will now decide whether she will spend life in prison or be put to death
@entity7 now on suicide watch after speaking about how she wants to die
