by @entity0 published : 09:19 est , 9 december 2012 updated : 08:51 est , 10 december 2012 @entity1 is set to set up camp in a luxury @entity4 home with husband @entity6 and plot her moves for a widely - expected run for the @entity9 in 2016			1
she will step down as secretary of state after the president 's inauguration in january , and aides have revealed how she will retreat to the @entity15 seaside famous for its wealthy residents			1
mrs @entity1 is also set to discuss whether or not she will run for president in 2016			1
mrs @entity1 got an unexpected endorsement from former @entity20 speaker of the @entity22 @entity21 , who said that his party has no one that could match her if she does step up for the nomination			1
weighing her options : @entity1 is likely to command hefty fees on the speaker circuit after she leaves her post as secretary of state , though it is unclear if she will run for president again in 2016 ' if their competitor in 2016 is @entity1 , supported by @entity35 and presumably a still relatively popular president @entity36 , trying to win that will be the @entity38			1
and the @entity20 today is incapable of competing at that level , ' he said during an appearance on @entity41			1
the compliment is particularly surprising considering that @entity43 and @entity35 famously sparred when they were rivals in the 1990s , and @entity43 was the one to push for the investigation of the then - president 's affair with intern @entity48			2
' first of all , she 's very formidable as a person			2
she 's a very competent person			2
she 's married to the most popular @entity50 in the country ; they both think ( it ) would be good for her to be president			0
it makes it virtually impossible to stop her for the nomination , ' he said			1
his prediction is backed up by numbers , as a recent @entity61 poll reports that 57 per cent of @entity62 would support a @entity1 campaign			0
according to multiple reports , mrs @entity1 has echoed her denials of plans to run for office in both private and public , but that does n't mean that she can just go ahead and truly let loose in her new - found state of unemployment			1
with any and all positions that she decides to take , she will have to weigh the optics of if it would look appropriate for a presidential candidate			1
that said , another concern is shoring up a steady income , because it does n't come cheap to live like the @entity80			0
the good life : the @entity80 have been frequent visitors to the @entity4 in the summer , seen here this past august , though it is now thought that they may be buying a place there longtime fans : president @entity35 ( seen here in 1999 ) has previously rented homes and stayed with some of their famous friends - like @entity90 and @entity91 the @entity92 reports that one of her first moves out of office would be to look into buying a home in the @entity4 , as she and former president @entity6 have frequently vacationed in the tony beach getaway			1
a home befitting two of the country 's biggest political heavyweights would easily run in the multi-million dollar range , any the couple are known to enjoy the benefits of a lifestyle that allows private jet use			0
much of her hesitation in deciding about 2016 comes from the failed bid in 2008 , and it comes as little surprise that those mistakes are also influencing her financial decisions			2
as recently as september 30 of this year , @entity1 still has $ 73,000 remaining of her campaign debt			0
@entity116 reported that her husband sent out multiple emails to supporters in hopes of earning back some of that money to have that number decreased - if not deleted - by this month			0
aides to mrs @entity1 say a continued working partnership between she and @entity6 is one of the likely steps after she takes some immediate time off from her taxing travel schedule following her leave of office			2
the @entity131 , which has occupied much of the former president 's time since he left the @entity22 , is seen as an ideal place for @entity1 to ease her way back into public life and find a way to work on causes closest to her			0
fighting for women 's rights has always been at the top of her agenda , and it is considered a given that she will be working for that cause in some form for the rest of her career			2
time together : aides think that @entity1 will spend some time working with her husband 's foundation as she finds her footing outside of the constraints of formal political office for the first time in decades who knows : she reportedly thinks that one of her biggest mistakes in her last presidential bid was announcing too early , so if she goes for it again , she likely wo n't say so publicly until mid- 2015 speaking engagements and a new book about her time as secretary of state are two other options for the ways to fill the time - and her bank accounts - but the frankness of those potential opportunities will be limited if she does eventually decide to run for president again			1
if her words are being seen as keys to a possible political agenda , as opposed to candid reflections on her time as the @entity62 emissary abroad , she will be forced to leave the candor for private conversations			0
realistically though , such a decision will not come for some time , as she has told insiders that one of the biggest mistakes she made in her last campaign was announcing her candidacy too early , effectively making the race longer and less manageable			0
that time , she announced two years before the election , so if she heeds her own advice , that means that she likely will not publicly discuss the option until mid- 2015			0
for now , however , she continues to keep all of her options open - and decidedly vague			0
' i â€™m frankly looking forward to returning to living a life that enjoys a lot of simple pleasures and gives me time for family and friends and other pursuits , ' she said during her latest trip to @entity195 .			0

leaving office in january and is considered a *frontrunner* for the @entity200 presidential nomination in 2016
@entity21 says *republicans* are ' incapable ' of running against her
