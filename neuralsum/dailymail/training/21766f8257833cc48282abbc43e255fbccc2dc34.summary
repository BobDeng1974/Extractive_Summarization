what a gamble : statisticians calculated a system to virtually guarantee a win a group of science and mathematical experts won almost $ 8million on a state lottery after discovering a fool - proof way of winning			1
the group , which included a biomedical researcher and @entity12 undergraduates who were ' looking for an interesting school project ' , bought more than $ 40million of tickets over seven years but won approximately $ 48million - an $ 8million profit			1
statisticians calculated that , during brief periods when the unclaimed jackpot of the @entity19 game total reached $ 2million , players buying $ 100,000 worth of tickets would almost certainly win			1
and their gamble paid off			0
using these small windows of opportunity , the group bought as many tickets as they could , using a loophole in which lottery officials failed to limit the amount that could be sold in one day			1
during these high payout intervals , the gambling syndicates won most of the lottery 's prizes			0
officials at the @entity37 state lottery knew one of their games had essentially been taken over by the group of highly - intelligent gamblers but did nothing because their syndicate generated $ 16million			1
the gambling group included graduates from the @entity12 ( pictured ) who were looking for an interesting school project the @entity12 researchers capitalised on the way the @entity19 game worked			2
unlike most lotteries , the jackpot was limited to $ 2m , and once this was surpassed the excess redistributed to smaller prizes – known as a ‘ roll - down ’ week			1
the smaller jackpots won by matching five of six numbers became five to ten times bigger on roll - down weeks – with the typical $ 4,000 win becoming up to $ 40,000			2
the group calculated if they bought $ 600,000 of tickets on rollover weeks , they would most likely make a 10 - 15 per cent profit			1
as the success of the scheme became clear they began buying enough tickets to force a roll - down week themselves			2
their system became an almost full - time business as the sophisticated gamblers snapped up hundreds of thousands of lottery tickets at $ 2 each			1
by 2005 they had essentially monopolised the game			0
the group 's scheme came to light in a recently - published report by the state 's inspector general , the @entity74 reports			0
it is thought lottery officials found out about the loophole in 2010 - or maybe earlier - but did not act because it was bringing in so much money , the report added			1
however , when journalists began looking into the loophole last summer , lottery chiefs introduced a $ 5,000 limit on the number of tickets retailers were allowed to sell every day			1
the @entity19 game was finally halted by @entity37 state treasurer @entity92 earlier this year			0
@entity92 told the @entity74 : ' i feel it is important to essentially apologise to the public because a game was created that allowed syndicates to gain special opportunities that others did not have - using machines themselves , partnership with lottery agents , using them after hours			2
we ’re sorry some gained unfair advantage			0
' revenues were tremendous and the lottery benefited , but there were practices that were not appropriate and things done that were not right			0
' the report into the @entity37 syndicate concluded that , while it had been a financial success for the lottery , no officials personally benefited financially from it			2
officials were simply guilty of failing to manage the game and enforcing the rules			0
@entity37 is not the only state to be targeted by gambling networks			0
the same loophole was used and exploited in a similar lottery in @entity124			0
one group was said to have netted $ 8million profit before the game was shut down in 2005 .			0

gamblers virtually took over @entity132 lottery , officials admit
statisticians , including biomedical researcher and @entity12 *students* , calculated a system to guarantee wins
@entity140 waited until unclaimed jackpot reached $ 2m - then snapped up hundreds of thousands of tickets
