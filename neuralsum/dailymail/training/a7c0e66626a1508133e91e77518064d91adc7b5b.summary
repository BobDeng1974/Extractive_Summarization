by @entity0 published : 09:32 est , 5 october 2012 updated : 10:53 est , 5 october 2012 @entity1 modelling her first ever lingerie collection called ' @entity3 ' designed in partnership with @entity5 she is earned her fortune thanks to her phenomenal figure and her passion for lingerie			1
but @entity11 - born model , actress and now designer @entity1 , 25 , has revealed she did n't always have the assets she does today			1
in fact , she earned the nickname tit - lips at school , because she had more padding on her mouth than she did on her chest			2
discussing the new line of lingerie she has designed for @entity5 , the @entity20 said she was given the moniker during her younger years because she had big lips and no cleavage			1
happily for her career , those days passed , and @entity27 - who has modelled underwear for brands including @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 - is these days very well - known for her fine feminine form			2
' it was n't a plan			0
it 's just naturally my look , i guess , ' she explained to @entity38			2
' i felt really empowered doing lingerie shoots			0
' lingerie is the ultimate feminine buy and i love the feeling it gives women , the empowerment			0
i love that it 's for women only and then men afterwards			2
' @entity27 had been approached by other brands to design a line of underwear , but none of them felt right for her to put her name to			0
then along came @entity5 , to whom the model felt a very personal connection since it was the shop where she had , despite her tit - lips nickname , bought her very first bra			1
' i love @entity5 : it 's so iconically @entity61			1
everybody shops there , it does n't matter whether you 've got a massive income or not			0
it just told a nice story for me			0
i brought my first bra there			0
' @entity27 said she bought her first ever bra at @entity5 , which motivated her to design a range for the company @entity27 's range of 1920s - inspired underwear for @entity5 , comprising a 33 - piece collection , went on sale last month and the pieces have proved to be extremely popular			1
she said : ' to find inspiration for the collection i trawled my favourite vintage shops and flea markets in @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity30			1
' i found a treasure trove of gorgeous clothes and ornate pieces of jewellery , as well as pictures and patterns in old design books and fashion magazines			0
' i was particularly drawn to the opulent elegance of the @entity92			0
' @entity27 , who is dating @entity61 actor @entity93 , 45 , delighted her 117,612 @entity95 followers recently by posting pictures of herself modelling her various newly released designs			1
