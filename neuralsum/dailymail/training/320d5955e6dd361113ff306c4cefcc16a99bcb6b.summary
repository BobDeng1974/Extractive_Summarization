a student who ended up stuck in a tree after plummeting 3,000 feet when his parachute failed to open has spoken about his terrifying near - death experience			1
@entity4 , 18 , walked away with only a few cuts and bruises after he narrowly missed a church , a metal fence and other obstacles on his first - ever parachute jump			1
the @entity12 student said : ' it was my first jump ever - i do n’t normally like heights			0
’ near - death experience : firefighters rescue @entity4 who landed in a tree after his parachutes failed to deploy properly mr @entity4 , who is originally from @entity21 in @entity22 , had recently joined the @entity23 and was jumping at the @entity24 in @entity25			1
he described how his first chute got entangled and then , after instructors used a radio to tell him to deploy his second chute , that got tangled up with the first			1
he said : ‘ everything was going ok but then after the parachute came out , my hand got caught up in it			2
‘ i managed to free my hand but as i looked up , the strings had twisted around the main parachute			2
to the rescue : the team of firefighters spent 45 minutes working to disentangle @entity4 stuck : the teenage parachutist narrowly missed a church , a metal fence and other obstacles on the way down before a tree broke his fall ‘ i tried kicking out to get them to unravel but i just started spiralling out			1
’ mr @entity4 , who had completed just eight hours of training the day before , performed the emergency procedures and tried to get rid of the main parachute to no effect			1
he added : ‘ both parachutes were open but only one had inflated - and that is the one that was caught			0
there was no way i could do anything			0
‘ i could n’t stop and started to spin again			0
i knew i had lost control			0
fortunate : emergency services said mr @entity4 was lucky to survive such a fall after falling 3,000 feet and getting stuck in a tree , he finally starts to descend after his terrifying ordeal ‘ i had no idea how bad the landing was going to be as i did n’t know how low i was			1
‘ the parachute collapsed in on itself and i pulled myself towards a tree			1
‘ i was suspended up in a tree , and i was swinging towards the trunk			2
‘ i had no idea how big the tree was or whether it would be able to hold my weight			2
’ @entity71 , a former soldier , who runs the @entity24 said that mr @entity4 had done a six to eight hour training course before doing the jump			1
he explained : ' we familiarise them with the exit position , which they practise a number of times			0
' they need to be in an arched position so that they move away from the deploying parachute when they jump			2
miraculous : despite falling a huge distance at speed , mr @entity4 managed to walk away with only a few cuts and bruises ( pictured ) ' unfortunately @entity4 did not adopt the arched position			1
' this happens from time to time when due to nerves , jumpers do not do it properly			0
' when the parachute opened the lines became caught under @entity4 ’s arm			1
' on occasion parachutes can become tangled so we teach people how to disentangle - but unfortunately @entity4 did not realise that he was tangled			2
' when people are struggling we have a cut off point where we have to get involved and do something about it			0
' over the radio we told him to deploy the reserve parachute			2
' he did and the reserve worked fine			0
' but the first parachute was still trapped under his arm			0
' he added that mr @entity4 was unable to control the reserve chute because it had become tangled up in the first chute which was wrapped around his body and flapping in his face			1
he said : ' because two of the parachutes were open , even though one was tangled , @entity4 travelled slightly more slowly than he otherwise would have done			2
' but speed was not the issue ... the problem was he had no direction control			0
' lucky : @entity4 ( left ) managed to walk away from the incident unscathed with only minor injuries ( right ) he added that @entity4 had probably been travelling at around 20 miles an hour when he landed			1
mr @entity4 was left suspended 30ft above the ground until emergency services arrived to free him			1
it took firefighters forty - five minutes to rescue him and when he finally touched ground , there was a round of applause from onlookers			0
@entity131 , from @entity132 and @entity133 said : ‘ he was fortunate , there ’s no doubt about it			0
' you ’ve got everything from a church to fencing and all sorts of stuff round there			0
’ safe and sound : the fire brigade and paramedics acted quickly after @entity4 's ( pictured ) fall mr @entity4 was left with just a bruise under his arm and a scrape to his hand , which was caused by the tree he landed in			1
his jump came just a day before @entity154 , 43 , performed a 128,000ft jump from the top of the stratosphere to break the sound barrier , making it the highest and fastest skydive in history			0
he said : ‘ it ’s pretty cool how this happened to me the same weekend that @entity154 broke the record			0
‘ i did n’t realise it at the time but when i watched his jump last night , i thought it was quite funny it was the day after i nearly died from parachuting from a much shorter distance ! ' the life - defying experience has not deterred mr @entity4 from having another go at parachuting in the future			1
he said : ‘ i ’m planning on going again , it ’s the only way to do it i think or i ’ll never get back up there			0
