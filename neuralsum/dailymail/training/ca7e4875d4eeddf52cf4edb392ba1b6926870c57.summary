by @entity0 published : 11:27 est , 27 november 2012 updated : 17:52 est , 27 november 2012 boasting the latest in design and tech , the @entity2 headphones from @entity3 claim to offer the definitive audio experience for gaming			1
indeed , if judged on looks alone , it ’s clear the x-rays mean business			2
sporting chunky lines with aggressive black styling and an attractive @entity15 power switch , and they resemble something kitted out to the @entity17			2
cutting edge : the @entity20 headset is packed full of the latest technology look a little closer , though , and you ’ll notice the quality of the materials – for example , the leatherette headband and memory foam ear cushions			1
they ’ve been marketed as the official headphones to @entity30 : @entity31 2 , a game that perhaps better than any , shows off the x-ray 's impressive features			2
immediately noticeable is the @entity36 5.1 surround sound			1
with crisp pitches and thundering bass , it brings audio to life with remarkable aplomb			0
you ’ll hear the tiniest details , and shudder at every crack and whoosh of explosions			1
the depth of sound is wonderful , too – with the 360 degree audio allowing you to pinpoint the direction of every sound			1
surround sound angles can be adjusted to optimise the audio experience			0
if things get too loud , the @entity57 function lets you reduce the amplitude of explosions and gunfire , while optimal sound quality is achieved through a digital audio connector			1
the x-rays also use 2.4/5 ghz @entity66 wifi , which virtually eliminates interference , while duel @entity69 pairing allows you to chat wirelessly			0
retailing for around £ 179 means that they are by no means cheap			0
but given the quality of the materials and state - of - the - art tech , the x-rays make a brilliant alternative to a vastly more expensive home cinema			1
cheaper option : the @entity80 may be around half the price , but they still provide excellent audio there are also the cheaper kilo versions , which retail for £ 69.99			0
although they are not as tech heavy as the x-rays , the @entity80 have n't skimped on quality			0
the @entity89 function , coupled with their massive 50mm speaker drivers , ensures immersive sound whatever the amplitude - making them a perfect purchase for the more causal gamer			0
