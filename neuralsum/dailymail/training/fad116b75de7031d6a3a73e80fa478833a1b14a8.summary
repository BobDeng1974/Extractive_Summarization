by @entity1 reporter published : 10:34 est , 8 september 2012 updated : 11:26 est , 8 september 2012 it ’s no secret that the @entity3 run a tight ship when it comes to parenting 14 - year - old @entity3 and 11 - year - old @entity6 , especially now the girls are fast heading into the tumultuous teenage years			1
as well as recounting endless anecdotes about their daughters , the first couple have mentioned various household rules they set for their girls over the past four years			2
but , when it comes to campaigning , it seems the girls number one rule is to be seen and not heard			0
smiling and waving - yes , and lots of it			0
talking - no , thank you			0
smile and wave : @entity3 , left , and @entity6 , right , appear with their parents during the final day of the @entity25 ; it seems the girls number one rule is to be seen and not heard cosy : the @entity30 released a heart - warming photo of @entity3 and @entity6 snuggled up on a couch with their father as they watched their mother give her moving convention speech on tuesday night and the two girls , now all grown up , excelled themselves on thursday night when they made a composed appearance at their father 's @entity25 speech			1
when not on the political trail themselves , the girls are frequently referenced by their parents , appear in campaign videos and on promotional posters			0
but , as the @entity47 pointed out , the sisters are barely ever heard speaking			0
' they are a bit of a mystery , ' @entity48 , an @entity49 donor and @entity51 writer - director , said of the sisters			2
' but they ’re authentic , and we ’re starving for that , ' he told the @entity47			0
indeed , as @entity49 ’s re-election campaign forges ahead , his daughters will be his not - so - secret but silent weapon			2
the girls clearly help @entity49 portray a family - man image and the president recounts carefully selected stories about them whenever he can - to the chagrin of his opponents			2
family man : @entity69 and @entity49 have always picked carefully selected stories to tell about their daughters , @entity6 , centre , and @entity3 , left			1
this 2009 picture shows just how much the girls have grown up since their father entered office back then : @entity3 ( left ) and @entity6 ( center right ) were only 10 and 7 years old respectively when they appeared at the @entity25 in @entity80 in 2008 on the night their father accepted the nomination the discipline to be seen and not heard , the oldest in the book , will be easy for @entity3 and @entity6 who are known to have strict rules set at home			1
those household rules , largely set by mom - in - chief @entity49 , which have been compiled by the @entity47 , offer a glimpse of what home life is like for the youngsters			0
here are some of the rules that @entity49 and @entity69 have confessed to laying down : ( incidentally , when they do watch tv , the girls are said to enjoy @entity97			2
) laying down the law : it is no secret that @entity49 and @entity69 set strict rules for their daughters , including no technology during the week color coordinated : on election night 2008 , it was clear that someone else picked out the girl 's outfits			1
more recently , it appears that the girls have had more of a say in their attire as they begin to experiment most changed : while both girls have obviously matured , @entity6 , who wore peach at the inauguration ( left ) and was only 7 when she moved into the @entity30 , looks much older now ( right ) vacation time : this past @entity120 , in 2011 , the first family traveled to their father 's home state of @entity124 the girls were back in the spotlight this week when they made an appearance at the president ’s poorly - received speech in @entity130 , @entity131 on thursday night			1
the day before , the @entity30 released a heart - warming photo of @entity3 and @entity6 snuggled up on a couch with their father as they watched their mother give her moving convention speech on tuesday night			1
the girls were unable to join their mother in @entity130 on the night of her speech - which has received almost universal praise - because it was their first day of school			2
@entity6 is now in sixth grade at @entity143 , which they chose to attend once their father was elected and they moved to @entity145 , @entity145 @entity3 just had her first day of high school on tuesday , reaching a milestone in her education thus far			1
president and first lady @entity49 sat down with @entity150 during a campaign stop towards the end of august and at that time they said how there was a lot to think about in terms of back - to - school preparations and @entity3 's transition to high school			1
' she 's going to be great			0
the truth is my girls , they do n't seem to have all the flaws i had when i was their age			0
they 're just good kids - smart , hardworking , kind , and respectful			0
they 'll adjust really well , ' mr @entity167 said			0
daddy daughter time : @entity49 was seen lifting @entity6 out of a car in 2008 ( left ) and walking with @entity3 very recently ( right ) as they left the @entity30 loving dad : @entity49 , pictured with his daughters , @entity3 , left , and @entity6 , far right , helps with homework at the @entity30			1
