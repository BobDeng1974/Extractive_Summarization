by @entity0 published : 12:01 est , 5 june 2012 updated : 04:45 est , 6 june 2012 the @entity1 said last night that she was ‘ humbled ’ by the reaction to her @entity7 celebrations , as more than a million cheering wellwishers surged into @entity3 to pay their respects			2
indeed , so moved was the monarch by the unbridled public euphoria surrounding four remarkable days of national festivities , that she chose , almost on the spur of the moment , to make a rare public address			2
@entity18 just before the start of monday night ’s @entity7 concert and broadcast around the globe yesterday evening , the @entity1 said she was ‘ deeply touched ’ at the way the celebrations had brought communities around the country together			1
‘ it has touched me deeply to see so many thousands of families , neighbours and friends celebrating together in such a happy atmosphere , ’ she said			1
the @entity1 's speech in full : the events that i have attended to mark my @entity7 have been a humbling experience			1
it has touched me deeply to see so many thousands of families , neighbours and friends celebrating together in such a happy atmosphere			1
but prince @entity46 and i want to take this opportunity to offer our special thanks and appreciation to all those who have had a hand in organising these jubilee celebrations			0
it has been a massive challenge , and i am sure that everyone who has enjoyed these festive occasions realises how much work has been involved			0
i hope that memories of all this year ’s happy events will brighten our lives for many years to come			1
i will continue to treasure and draw inspiration from the countless kindnesses shown to me in this country and throughout the @entity27			0
she also expressed her gratitude to all those who had helped to organise events , including sunday ’s @entity69 , and concluded : ‘ i hope that memories of all this year ’s happy events will brighten our lives for many years to come			1
‘ i will continue to treasure and draw inspiration from the countless kindnesses shown to me in this country and throughout the @entity27			0
’ the last time the @entity1 addressed the nation outside her annual @entity75 speech was following the death of princess @entity77 in 1997			1
filming took place in the private @entity79 at @entity28 , with one of the @entity46 and @entity81 of @entity83 ’s official engagement portraits behind her			1
the @entity1 wore a pale blue day dress by @entity85 and her stunning @entity88 aquamarine and diamond clips , which were an 18th birthday present from her parents in 1944			0
aides said she made the decision to film her address only last wednesday after witnessing the groundswell of public support in the run - up to the jubilee weekend			2
she also stoically chose to go ahead hours after her husband , the @entity46 , was taken to hospital with a bladder infection			0
the couple have been married for 64 years and the @entity1 openly credits him as being her ‘ strength and stay ’ for the six decades of her reign			2
her husband was clearly on her mind throughout yesterday ’s @entity105 which saw her attend a @entity106 of @entity107 at @entity108 before a carriage procession through the streets of @entity111 and a fly - past over @entity28			1
as she stepped on to the balcony at the palace to a deafening roar of applause , she turned to her grandson @entity117 and said wistfully : ‘ i wish @entity46 were here			0
’ ' @entity118 ' : the @entity1 is joined by @entity119 and the @entity46 and @entity81 after the service of thanksgiving at @entity108 , one of several events held today to end the celebrations awash with royalists : lines of police officers lead thousands of revellers up the @entity3 to the gate of @entity28 to watch @entity1 appear on the palace balcony grand finale : the @entity132 perform a flypast for the @entity1 over @entity28 watched by a thrilled crowd below then , as the @entity136 echoed out , the normally restrained sovereign appeared to blink back tears			1
yesterday ’s balcony scene was a tight - knit affair with just the @entity1 , the @entity119 , the @entity140 , the @entity46 and @entity81 and prince @entity142 present			1
it was markedly different from the @entity144 , when more than 30 royals appeared with her at the palace			0
sources suggested it was a conscious effort by the sovereign to focus attention on her immediate successors			0
prime minister @entity152 summed up the mood of the nation when he said the celebrations had shown the ‘ best of @entity157 ’			0
he hailed the @entity1 as ‘ a real inspiration ’ , and , in a reference to the @entity46 ’s illness and the wet weather , praised the ‘ great resilience ’ of both the sovereign and her subjects			0
he said : ‘ i think what we ’ve seen , frankly , is the best of @entity157			0
we ’ve seen people coming together in tremendous unity and spirit to celebrate the @entity1 ’s jubilee , but we ’ve also seen a great resilience ; people wanting to celebrate , even though the weather ’s been pretty bad , and an extraordinary resilience on behalf of @entity1 , who in spite of all the problems and difficulties has kept going , and with such incredible spirit			0
she ’s a real inspiration			0
’ @entity183 president @entity182 , with whom the @entity1 has developed a warm relationship , sent a video message from the @entity186 , saying : ‘ while many presidents and prime ministers have come and gone , your majesty ’s reign has endured			2
’ the queen was due to stay at @entity28 last night because she has a lunch with @entity27 heads of government at @entity196 in @entity111 today			1
in the absence of the @entity46 she will instead be escorted by one of her ladies - in - waiting			2
appreciation : a fan shows their support for the @entity1 with a banner reading ' @entity205 : she 's a diamond ! ' during the @entity207 along the mall her loyal subjects : in her message from @entity28 , the @entity1 said she hoped memories of the jubilee celebrations will brighten people 's lives for many years to come much - loved : the @entity1 receives a kiss on the hand by @entity119 after her son paid a moving tribute to her at the end of the @entity220 on monday night lighting up the capital : a spectacular fireworks display brings the curtain down on the @entity220 , which attracted around 500,000 people to the streets and parks surrounding @entity28 ' massive challenge ' : the @entity1 has shown her appreciation to the organisers of jubilee events , which included the 1,000 - strong flotilla ( above ) which sailed along the @entity232 on sunday for the river pageant			1
