police officers failed to spot that an elderly widow whose throat had been cut had been murdered			2
@entity3 , 86 , was repeatedly stabbed in the neck and then set on fire in the horrific attack at the bungalow where she lived alone			1
but detectives , paramedics and firefighters trampled through her home , ‘ severely contaminating ’ the murder scene , after concluding that she had somehow set herself alight after falling on her cooker			1
police had found the body of the retired postmistress , pictured with late husband @entity20 , covered in blood and with her clothing ' burnt to a crisp ' in the hallway muddy footprints were left on the floor , a detective touched her front door key with his bare hand and her grieving family was even allowed into the property to clean it up			1
concerns were only raised two days later by a mortuary technician			2

‘ i have to say the handling of evidence by the police has been unfortunate , ’ he said			2
a theory was formed relatively early on by acting detective sergeant @entity55 that @entity3 had fallen on the hob or cooker and somehow set fire to herself and panicked , and had a heart attack and collapsed in the hallway			1
‘ in this suspicious death , foul play was too readily dismissed by police officers			2
’ not treating the area as a full crime scene prevented a ‘ proper forensic examination ’ from being carried out			0
mrs @entity69 ’s niece , @entity68 , told the hearing she was lost for words			0
‘ i can not understand why this evidence was n’t picked up , ’ she said			0

@entity102 pathologist @entity101 told the hearing : ‘ this was clearly a homicide from the wounds i saw – that ’s not to say that ’s how it was treated			0
‘ i concluded that she died from multiple stab wounds to her chest and neck			0
’ police cordoned off the home after the original officers , paramedics and firefighters who attended the scene on january 13 2013 all decided the widow had died in an accident forensic teams finally investigate the crime scene outside mrs @entity69 's home - four days after her body was found senior investigator detective inspector @entity127 told the inquest : ‘ the scene was severely contaminated by the police , firefighters and paramedics because this had not been initially picked up as a murder investigation			1
’ a paramedic had prodded the body and transferred mrs @entity3 ’s blood to a light switch before rummaging through a chest of drawers			1
