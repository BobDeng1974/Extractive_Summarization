the admirable show of respect between players when they swap shirts is usually reserved for the end of a match , not half - time			1
but during the break between @entity9 and @entity10 on sunday , a few of the players saw fit to get in early and bag themselves their opponents ' shirts with 45 minutes left on the clock			0
after referee @entity16 blew his whistle for half - time in @entity9 's thrilling win at @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity10 defender @entity22 and @entity9 star @entity23 swapped shirts while making their way down off the pitch			1
really ? @entity23 ( left ) and @entity22 ( right ) change shirts at half - time at @entity20 and they were n't the only ones			1

former @entity58 defender @entity57 provoked outrage from fans when he approached ex-gunner @entity61 for a half - time swap in the @entity64 's first game against his former club after joining @entity66			2
the @entity33 defender did n't endear himself to the travelling @entity58 fans after a torrid half at @entity70 that saw @entity72 net after just three minutes for @entity66			0
