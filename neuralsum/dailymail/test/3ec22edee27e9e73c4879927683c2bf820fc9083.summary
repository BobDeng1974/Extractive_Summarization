@entity0 is responsible @entity1 , the lyrics of which have been puzzled over for decades there has never been a popular song quite like it			1
for more than 40 years , its lyrics have been an enigma wrapped in an eight - and - a - half minute long rock ' n ' roll puzzle			1
argued over by generations of geeky fans , deciphered and re-deciphered by code - breaking rock nerds and considered to be poetic reflections on mid- 20th century @entity17 social history by even groovier academics , it 's called @entity1			1
and this week its lyrics , hand - written in 1971 by a young folk singer called @entity0 , were sold at auction in @entity22 for more than $ 1 million			1
that 's a lot of money for 18 sheets of paper , albeit with a lost seventh verse			2
but , to be honest , i rather think that whoever bought them got a bargain			2
because , in this age , when song lyrics have all but become meaningless , @entity1 illustrates , in a series of images , metaphors and allusions , just what can be done within the frame of a melodically straightforward pop song			1
it 's also a paean to education			2
@entity0 loves words , he says , ' almost as much as life '			2
that may be a slight overstatement , but it shows			2
of course , like all poets , @entity0 did n't give us a key to the riddle of what his song was about when he released his multi-million - selling single			2
that would have spoiled it			2
' it means i 'll never have to work again , ' he would joke about how much money the song had made him , leaving us to work out for ourselves what the ' sad news on the doorstep ' was exactly , and why he ' could n't take one more step ' when he read it			2
that was the easy part , of course , for anyone of my and his generation who learned about the death in a plane crash in 1959 of one of the first great singer - songwriters of rock , @entity73 , when we read about it in the morning newspaper			1
as @entity0 sings , it was truly ' the day the music died '			2
i was on a ribble bus going to school in @entity81 , peering over the shoulder of the man in front of me when i saw the headline			0
@entity0 , according to his song , anyway , was 14 and delivering papers in the rather smart @entity22 suburb of @entity89 where he grew up			0
it was a strange , wistful opening for a pop song , but then , as the beat kicked in , the lyrics began to portray the innocence of @entity96 - fearing , teenage high school in @entity97			1
listing pop song titles like the @entity100 and a @entity101 and a @entity102 , and dances in the gym where the worst that could happen would be that the girl you fancied was dancing with some other guy , it painted a picture of what by 1971 was already a bygone time			0
then , in between every verse , would come that cryptic chorus about driving his ' @entity114 to the levee but the levee was dry '			0
for years , i thought that was something to do with the raised earthworks — levees — that run along the banks of the @entity123 in @entity124 , until i discovered that a ' levee ' can also mean a party			1
so the parties that kids would attend in the non-threatening @entity129 would always have been dry — that is , without alcohol			0
yes , same in @entity131			0
on the surface , it might seem that @entity1 — especially the first half , which was the section mainly played on the radio because the record was far too long to be played in full — was just a misty - eyed lament for an untroubled @entity139 and @entity141 youth			1
but , suddenly , the mood changed as @entity0 — jaundiced almost , and certainly disappointed — looked around late - @entity143 and saw how the ' jester in a coat he borrowed from @entity146 ' ( thought to mean @entity147 in his leather jacket ) stole the @entity150 's ' thorny crown '			1
or , as you and i might say , knocked @entity153 off his top - notch perch			0
almost everything is seen through youth icons			0
in the line ' while @entity157 read a book on @entity159 ' , was he teasingly criticising @entity161 for appearing to be espousing @entity163 revolutionary theory in his solo songs ? i think he might have been			0
and was ' helter skelter in a summer swelter ' a reference to the murders of actress @entity169 and friends by the ' @entity171 ' in @entity172 in the summer of 1969 ? it has to be			1
in an absurd defence , murderer @entity171 maintained that he had interpreted @entity176 innocuous lyrics in their song @entity178 as instructions to go out and kill			1
@entity171 is still in jail			1
even after all these years , much of @entity1 is still opaque			1
was the reference to @entity183 ' record @entity182 a comment on the carpet - bombing by @entity17 jets in @entity187 ? only @entity0 knows — and he is n't saying			0
when asked to give a few hints as to the meaning of the lyrics for this week 's auction catalogue , he simply said that ' the song was not a parlour game ' , but ' an indescribable photograph of @entity97 that i tried to capture in words and music '			1
and metaphor , he might have added , as , in my interpretation of the lyrics , a game of @entity200 becomes a student demonstration , probably at @entity204 , over @entity97 's military extension of the @entity206 to @entity207 , to the music of @entity176 ' @entity210 album			2
to this day , songwriter @entity0 has refused to divulge what the lyrics of @entity1 refer to ' the half - time air was sweet - perfume ' , which probably means that everybody was smoking pot , and wanting to have a nice , quiet time , when the demo was broken up violently by the @entity219 , who shot four students dead			1
then there 's the question of @entity224			0
is he ' @entity226 , @entity225 be quick , @entity225 sat on a @entity227 ' ? maybe			0
but there is confusion because it is n't @entity176 ' famous last @entity17 show at @entity231 , @entity232 , that @entity0 is singing about , but @entity234 ' performance at nearby @entity235 in 1969			0
at that concert , the @entity234 performed @entity238 and then watched helplessly as , before them in the crowd , @entity236 beat a man to death			0
' and as i watched him on the stage , my hands were clenched in fists of rage , ' go the lyrics of @entity1			1
' no angel born in hell , could break that @entity251 's spell			0
' dancing to rock ' n ' roll was never meant to get like this , he seems to be saying			0
i 'm not sure that if i were @entity224 , i 'd want to hear that sung about myself			0
although @entity0 said before the auction of his song 's lyrics that the pages would ' divulge everything there is to divulge ' about this ' mystical trip into my past ' , they clearly do n't			1
but the material does cast some light on how the song changed before he recorded it			0
originally , he had intended a positive ending , suggesting an extra verse that the music he once loved would be reborn in happier times			0
but in the end he settled for the more worldly-wise : ' the three men i admire the most , @entity276 / they caught the last train for the coast / the day the music died			0
' a bleak ending , yes , but apart from the reference to the @entity282 , is there also perhaps a nod here to @entity286 , @entity287 and @entity150 , whose assassinations occurred in the @entity289 ? again , @entity0 is n't saying			1
what he does do , however , is give excellent advice to songwriters who are just starting out : ' immerse yourself in beautiful music and beautiful lyrics and think about every word you say in a song			2
' were the lyrics ' @entity276 ' a nod to @entity286 ( left ) , @entity287 and @entity150 ( right ) , whose assassinations occurred in the @entity289 ? it seems so obvious , does n't it ? but then you turn on the radio and realise that , with just a few exceptions , an appreciation of good music and lyrics has played little part in the education of so many of today 's songwriters			1
as @entity0 showed , the right word can mean so much			0
most people will probably think of 69 - year - old @entity0 as a one - hit wonder — now living in semi-retirement , and no doubt the lap of luxury , with his wife in @entity320			0
and he certainly was n't able to ever better @entity1			1
but at around the same time , he also wrote two other pop classics			0
@entity322 , about @entity324 's painting @entity323 , as well as @entity325			0
this week 's buyer of the lyrics of @entity1 unfortunately prefers to remain anonymous , and that suggests to me that 's he 's a billionaire who wants to frame them and stick them on his study wall			1
i 'd far rather they had been bought by an university so students of @entity17 literature and social history could spend another 40 - odd years poring over them , and discussing what can be done with a popular song , and how @entity97 was , as it says in the lyrics , a ' long , long time ago ' .			1

for more than 40 years , the lyrics of @entity1 have been puzzled over
this week the *handwritten* lyrics sold for more than $ 1 million at auction
the verses contain hidden references to seminal events of the 50s and *60s*
it *includes* nods to @entity73 , @entity171 and @entity150
