by @entity0 published : 23:24 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 02:32 est , 13 june 2013 doctors have become so casual about their work attire that patients struggle to identify their position at a hospital unless they return to a more traditional uniform , they risk ‘ eroding ’ the patients ’ trust in their competence , a senior consultant has warned			2
medical staff in white coats and ties have become a rare sight since they were banned by the @entity16 in 2007 , restricting the wearing of the classic attire to private practices			1
dress to impress : unless they dress in proper uniforms , doctors risk losing the respect of patients as they struggle to identify their position at a hospital following a decision by the @entity27 , doctors were ordered to remove ties , watches , coats and shirts and remain ‘ bare below the elbow ’ in order to make it easier to wash their hands and prevent spreading bacteria			1
‘ i hear that patients complain that they do not know who the doctor is : no tie , no white coat , no jacket and no presence , ’ @entity37 , consultant microbiologist at @entity24 , @entity36 writes in the @entity38			0
‘ @entity45 erodes the image of doctors as responsible and competent			0
’ ‘ [ @entity48 ] gives confidence to patients who might be facing life or death decisions			0
’ dr @entity37 writes that the 2007 ban has been seen as a ‘ green light ’ for doctors to dress casual and adds that there is no evidence that wearing a white coat helps spread infection			1
@entity59 versus smart : casually dressed dr @entity60 , played by @entity62 , is surrounded by his properly attired colleagues in the popular @entity65 television series however the @entity27 stands firm in their ban of white coats			2
‘ @entity16 staff should wear short - sleeved tops and not wear white coats during patient activity – being “ bare below the elbow ” makes it easier for staff to wash their hands and lower arms regularly , ’ a spokesperson told @entity79			1
‘ however , @entity16 staff should also dress in a way which inspires public and patient confidence			2
dr @entity37 argues the opposite , saying that casual attire may have the opposite effect as ‘ street clothes ’ may not be washed regularly enough , compared to a white hospital coat			0
‘ it could be argued that ditching the white coat and tie for hygiene purposes has had the converse effect , in that the informal attire now gracing our wards has encouraged a less robust view of infection control			0

the ban on white coats for medical staff is *confusing* @entity16 patients
doctors in casual dress also ' risks losing patients ' confidence and trust '
@entity16 banned doctors from wearing ties , coats , shirts and watches in 2007
