@entity0 need to start playing with their heads and not with their hearts			1
against @entity6 they seemed to allow the emotion and pressure of the situation affect their football , they looked to be strangled by fear			1
i know they ’re not a typical @entity16 team of the past - with all the tricks and samba skills - but the amount of long balls on saturday evening , along with the lack of organisation defensively , meant they were not too difficult to play against			1
@entity23 will have taken note			1
i ’ve never seen a @entity0 team play so directly before and the tension definitely affected them against @entity6			1
their opponents on friday , @entity23 , will not approach the game with any concern			1
they have to stop @entity44 , yes , but they will fancy their chances			2
they will come into the game with confidence and they will believe they can beat the hosts			1
@entity0 need more organisation and control of their emotions as only @entity44 has that typical @entity16 x-factor we have seen in their teams over the years			1
@entity59 man : @entity29 believes @entity44 ( right ) is the only current @entity0 player with their trademark x-factor flair do they look hard to beat ? not right now			1
@entity63 and @entity64 are obviously valued by the manager , @entity65 , and i ’m sure they give something to the team , but we ’ve yet to see the evidence			0
@entity72 , a gifted player for @entity74 , played well in the first game against @entity76 , scoring the thirdgoal , but he has drifted and was on the fringes of the following matches			0
i ’d like to see his @entity81 team - mate @entity80 come in to add more energy and power			2
the supporters ’ role has been huge and i think they dragged the team to penalties against @entity6 , as they looked drained			1
fervent backing : @entity0 's fans have been vociferous in their support of the host nation this summer @entity93 : @entity0 when a team and the crowd come together like that it can feel unstoppable for a player			1
i have witnessed it at @entity99 on those big @entity101 nights			0
i can remember @entity102 making fast starts — scoring early against @entity74 in 2005 and 2007 , @entity104 in 2005 , @entity105 in 2009 , feeding off the crowd			0
you ca n’t play like that for 90 minutes , but they influenced the results and the performance in a positive way			2
it ’s not always the case , however			0
@entity115 was the @entity74 manager in those @entity101 games and , during @entity117 recently , i spoke to him about this very subject			0
we talked about the game at @entity99 last season when @entity74 won and effectively ended @entity102 ’s chance of winning the title			0
until that point , it looked as if @entity102 would be champions			0
@entity115 said he felt @entity102 were too emotional that day , too hyped up			2
he cited players tryingto wrestle the ball off him on the touchline after ten minutes			0
he said they became desperate and were shooting and crossing from stupid angles			0
tear - jerker : @entity44 ( front ) was crying in delight after @entity0 's last - 16 penalty shootout win against @entity6 i saw similar signs of such desperation in @entity0 ’s play on saturday			1
when the emotion cascades down from the crowd , the players need to show cool heads			2
right now , they are too wrapped up in the passion as the host nation			0
i know they want to avenge the 1950 tournament where they lost to @entity146 at home , which istotally understandable			0
but the head has to overrule the heart			0
after the @entity6 victory , there were scenes with @entity44 crying and @entity65 looking close to the same reaction — but it was a last - 16 game , not a semi-final or a final ! danger : @entity23 's @entity157 will pose a threat to @entity0 having scored five @entity32 five goals so far they need to get themselves in check because there is a long way for them to go if they are towin this and more emotional examinations			1
they have not yet put in a top - class performance in four games — if it continues they will come unstuck , possibly on friday when @entity157 , who has been brilliant , and his team arrive			1
watching the @entity16 players sing their national anthem has been the most inspiring thing for me in this tournament , but the emotion in that - the build - up and atmosphere around the games as the hosts and favourites - can be very draining			2
they need to deal with that better than we have seen so far or they will be out			0
video the secret histroy of @entity0 's inconic jersey			2
