but the world 's scallops and oysters are mysteriously dying out , new figures have revealed			2
the creatures , which have been successfully farmed in pristine , deep water sounds off @entity9 in @entity10 since the 1970s , are now being killed off in dramatic numbers			2
this is causing suppliers in area - once responsible for nearly two - fifths of @entity17 ’s farmed shellfish - to warn of shortages and producers to worry about the future of their businesses			1
decline : @entity10 was once responsible for nearly two - fifths of @entity17 ’s farmed shellfish			1
but as the area 's scallops and oysters are mysteriously dying out , it now supplies only 20 per cent of the country 's total dying out : oysters and scallops , which have been successfully farmed in pristine , deep water sounds off @entity9 in @entity10 since the 1970s , are now being killed off in dramatic numbers alarmingly , scientists do not know what the culprit is behind the mass die - offs			1
however , the increasing acidification of the ocean has been widely cited as the main suspect			2
in the past two years , eight to nine - tenths of baby oysters have died in @entity43 farms - a shocking rise from the normal mortality rate of around 50 per cent , @entity40 reported			1
' it ’s a remote area , the water is clean ... we have n’t had any environmental concerns , so i ’m not sure what ’s going on , ' @entity46 , who annually harvests half a million oysters at the farms , said			0
' to be frank , we do n’t know a lot about it and that ’s what ’s scary			0
' meanwhile , scallop farmers off @entity9 have reported hatchling die - offs since 2010			2
earlier this year , one - third of the workforce ( 20 employees ) at @entity63 were laid off because the business lost more than 10 million scallops before they reached maturity			2
when asked if he had ever seen such a mass die - off before , @entity69 , ceo of @entity63 , told @entity70 : ' nothing like this - continual mass mortality			0
' rise : the increasing acidification of the ocean has been widely cited as the main suspect in the mass die - offs			1
above , the falling ph levels in the sea are directly linked to the rising levels of co2 in the atmosphere making cuts : earlier this year , one - third of the workforce at @entity63 ( pictured , employees farming shellfish ) were laid off because the business lost more than 10 million scallops before they reached maturity some people have pointed to warming coastal waters as a potential reason for the shocking figures			1
this shift in temperature is altering the timing of zooplankton blooms , which the shellfish feed off			0
others believe changes in the environment have worsened the devastation caused by an oyster herpes virus , which has been wiping out oysters in @entity105 and @entity106 , @entity98 reported			1
the virus has killed 26 percent of @entity105 ’s oyster production since 2008 , while it was reportedly responsible for the deaths of a staggering 10 million oysters in three days in @entity106			1
and some , including mr @entity46 , have suggested that there may be too many scallops and oysters in the waters off @entity9 , and not enough food to feed them , putting them under stress			2
affected : when asked if he had ever seen such a mass die - off of scallops before , @entity69 ( pictured ) , ceo of @entity63 , told @entity70 : ' nothing like this			0
' he added that he is convinced the ocean is more acidic however , the main culprit in the mass die - offs of scallops and oysters is believed to be the ocean 's acidification , with the ph levels at @entity9 having fallen drastically in recent years			1
the levels slipped from an average of 8.1 in 1974 to 7.2 by 2001 ( a ph of below 7 - on a scale of 0 - 14 - is considered acidic ) , according to the @entity135			0
this is increasingly depriving baby shellfish of the carbonate ions they need to grow tough shells , which could leave them more vulnerable to parasites and disease , experts claim			1
mr @entity69 said : ' i ’m convinced the ocean is getting much more acidic , and much more acidic than anyone anywhere believed it could happen that fast			0
' according to the @entity151 @entity150 , the falling ph levels in the ocean are directly linked to the rising levels of co2 in the atmosphere			1
as carbon dioxide levels increase , so do those in the ocean , altering the seawater ’s chemistry			0
@entity160 , a research scientist , said it is clear oceans are becoming more acidic - but that more research needs to be done into the oyster and scallop die - offs to confirm a link			0
@entity167 , of @entity168 , agreed that further research is urgently needed to keep the shellfish industry afloat - adding that it is a ' global ' , not national problem			0
every year , @entity17 produces more than 12,000 tonnes of oysters , worth a staggering $ 18million			0
@entity10 was formerly responsible for 40 per cent of the country 's shellfish crop			1
now , it supplies just 20 per cent .			0

scallops and oysters are dying in drastic numbers off @entity9
since 2012 , nine tenths of baby oysters have died at @entity184
this is causing suppliers in @entity10 area to warn of shortages
experts do not know what culprit is - main suspect is sea 's acidification
falling ph levels are *stopping* baby shellfish from growing tough shells
oyster herpes virus has wiped out oysters in both @entity105 and @entity106
@entity10 used to supply 40 **%** of @entity17 's shellfish - it now supplies just 20 **%**
