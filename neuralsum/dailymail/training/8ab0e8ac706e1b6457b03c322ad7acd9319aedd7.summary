by @entity0 published : 14:17 est , 5 april 2013 updated : 14:38 est , 5 april 2013 multi-millionaire @entity2 stars are more often than not dismissed as mercenaries who are happy to wear the colours of whichever club is offering the biggest pay cheque or winning the most trophies			0
but in a stunt aimed at inspiring @entity12 supporters , kit makers @entity8 want to show fans that the club 's galaxy of stars really are true blue			1
the ‘ it ’s @entity19 ’ campaign sees players covered in blue liquid in a bid to get fans of the @entity25 club to buy the new kit before they even see it			1
it is based on the idea that the club is not just a team but something much more emotive than that			0
an @entity8 spokesman said : ' the campaign was created based on the insight that @entity12 can clearly own blue as a colour			1
' not only do they sing about it , but they are the only club in the @entity2 that call themselves the @entity81			2
' seeing the players take part and show their commitment to the colour and the lengths that they will go to will inspire the fans and show the club as they have never been seen before			0
' the 90 second film that has been created for the campaign features @entity44 , @entity91 , @entity53 and club captain @entity45 among other big name stars			1

@entity45 ’s feet are then seen being covered in blue as a suspended barrel of the blue starts to slowly pour creating a wall of paint			0
the clip then cuts back to @entity45 , @entity44 and @entity53 , who are all bare chested , sizing up the blue liquid in front of them			1
skipper @entity45 is then pictured falling back into a pool of the blue liquid , a scene that had to be shot in one take , and the locker that was bleeding the three stripes suddenly explodes over @entity44 , who does not flinch such is his commitment to being blue			1
dramatic : @entity91 , left , bursts out of a vat of blue at the end of the clip while @entity62 is also pictured in action covered in blue on display : the pictures from the advertising campaign will be placed around @entity25 in time for sunday 's visit of @entity144 defender @entity53 walks through the wall of paint in a dramatic scene before the climax of the film shows @entity91 as he bursts out of a vat of blue which he was submerged in			0
the players who took part spent more than two hours on set to create the campaign			0
and while being doused in blue paint is a bit of a contrast to the normal daily training routine , the shoot was a welcome change for the players involved			0
@entity163 defender @entity91 said : ' i have really enjoyed being part of this day , i would do anything for this club and to show my passion for being a @entity19 means everything to me			0
