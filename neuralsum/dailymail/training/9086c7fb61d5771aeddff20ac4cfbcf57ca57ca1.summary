by @entity0 as an @entity3 country manor in the centre of @entity5 , it has been at the heart of diplomatic relations between @entity8 and the @entity9 since the 1920s			1
for 80 years a visit to the grand , sweeping ballroom of the @entity8 ambassador 's residence has become the ultimate statement of power and style			1
yards from the official residence of the vice president , the building has played host to figures from @entity24 and @entity25 to @entity26 and the @entity27			1
now the building - the only one in @entity29 by sir @entity30 , who designed the @entity31 in @entity33 's @entity32 and the @entity35 building in @entity36 - has been paid lavish tribute in the first book of its kind			1
an @entity3 's home : a butler carries an urn of tea outside the main entrance to the ambassador 's residence in @entity5			1
despite its scale , some inhabitants complained about the dark entrance elegant : in invitation to dine at the @entity8 ambassador 's residence in @entity5 is the ultimate symbol of power			1
a new book explores the history of the @entity3 - style manor which helped forge the special relationship special guests : as well as political leaders the building has hosted stars of the silver screen such as @entity26 , pictured left with her husband @entity66 meeting @entity69 and president @entity70 in 1976 relationship : prime minister @entity24 with general @entity72 at the embassy 's door in 1952 in his study @entity76 , renowned historian dr @entity75 tells how the building became a haunt of both nations ' brokers of power and popular culture over 80 years			1
@entity84 sipped tea on the terrace with the banker @entity87 just months before the outbreak of the @entity89 , which would cement a permanent alliance between the two nations			2
months after the war broke out , he hosted a garden party for 5,000 people which saw a ferocious scramble for tickets and helped to secure @entity29 's loyalty in what has been known ever since as the ' special relationship ' between the @entity9 and @entity8			1
@entity25 held two dinners in the ballroom for president @entity103 , as their world view brought them together in the closest ' special relationship ' until the controversial one between @entity106 and @entity107			1
the palatial home has remained a powerful symbol of @entity111 relations despite the original complex becoming too small for the administrative side of the embassy , which moved to a purpose - built centre next - door in the late 1950s			2
but it was not just a place for @entity8 leaders to hold court			0
@entity9 took it on as their own too , including @entity121 , who hosted her last dinner as secretary of state inside its grandiose rooms			0
months before war : @entity126 chatted to the banker @entity87 on the terrace in june 1939 pop stars : even the @entity27 visited the embassy in their prime , attending a charity ball in february 1964 special relationship : @entity25 greets @entity133 and @entity103 at the @entity8 embassy in 1981 star guests : @entity137 with his wife @entity136 and @entity139 with @entity140 prime location : the embassy is a stone 's throw from the official residence of the vice president a redbrick palace with an entrance like one of a museum , the residence was deliberately designed in the style of @entity154 country manor			1
it was the first of many diplomatic centres in the road now described as @entity158 , stretching almost from the @entity159 to the @entity160			0
set back from the street , it has eight acres of rose gardens , lawns and greenhouses , presided over by a statue of @entity24 clutching his trademark cigar			2
it does have @entity111 touches : @entity30 used @entity171 limestone and @entity173 bricks to show partnership with the @entity9 , and its enormous scale is a tribute to @entity111 style			2
those lucky enough to be invited as guests are presided over by an attentive staff , who serve tea in immaculate @entity183 china			0
the building has not always been so popular , however			0
in his new book @entity185 , the headmaster of the famed private school @entity186 , reveals how its first residents bombarded the renowned architect with complaints , partly about the gigantic portico over its entrance			0
grand : the ambassador 's residence was built like a @entity154 manor on a vast scale in the heart of the capital leafy : the home is set in eight acres of gardens and is round the corner from the vice president 's residence now infamous , the phrase was coined by none other than sir @entity24 , who gave a speech in the @entity9 in the aftermath of the @entity89			1
standing before a crowd in @entity212 , @entity213 , in 1946 , he called for ' a special relationship between the @entity215 and @entity216 and the @entity160 ' , who can ' work together at the common task as friends and partners '			2
since then the message of the speech , which also coined the phrase ' @entity224 ' , has more or less been taken for granted			0
it resurged particularly strongly in the 1980s , when @entity25 and @entity226 shared a political view of the world and a strong desire to end the @entity230			0
but it has , of course , been strained in the past			0
when @entity236 refused to send @entity8 troops into @entity238 , the relationship between the two nations was weakened , though it never broke to due @entity8 backbenchers emphasising their support			2
and when @entity107 co-operated with president @entity106 to send troops into @entity243 , the nature of the relationship took on a new , sinister significance for millions			0
sir @entity246 , the famed @entity8 ambassador to @entity5 of the 1920s , complained that the dark , imposing doorway ' resembles the entrance to a tube station or a mortuary chapel ' , the @entity245 reported			1
his successor 's wife , meanwhile , complained in 1930 that the newly - opened residence was ' overrun ' with rats			2
but despite initial grumblings , the grand home has become a nationally - registered historic building in the @entity9 and a cornerstone of what has been termed the ' special relationship '			1
in a speech to journalists to celebrate the book 's release , @entity8 ambassador to @entity5 sir @entity265 said the building was still something ' really rather special '			1
' the reason why this book has been produced is because for [ my wife ] @entity272 and me it is such an enormous privilege to live in this extraordinary house			0
' here we were at a time when the @entity8 government decided that it needed to make a bold statement about its relationship with @entity5 and @entity29 , recruiting probably the best - known of the @entity8 architects at the time to make a very brave and deliberate statement about the relationship			2
' here we are with a house which is built for purpose			0
' iit 's not like most of the other great embassies , of which there are a number in this city , which were houses built by someone else for their own purposes and then bought by government			0
' it has lots of space and a design which allows us to have lots of people in here			0
' power and royalty : prince @entity303 and princess @entity304 at the embassy in 1985 with @entity72 and @entity306 haunt : princess @entity308 in 1995 ( left ) and @entity309 with @entity121 in 2008			0
@entity310 chose to hold her final dinner as secretary of state in the ambassador 's residence as a tribute to the continuing special relationship modern times : @entity309 , then prime minister , with future president @entity318 in 2008 grand : @entity107 speaking to the media on the steps of the @entity8 embassy in 1996			1
the invasion of @entity243 and @entity107 's co-operation with @entity106 allowed the relationship to take on a new meaning for many			0
