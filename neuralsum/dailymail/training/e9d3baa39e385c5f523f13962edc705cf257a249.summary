by @entity0 published : 12:30 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 02:43 est , 10 september 2013 discovery : @entity2 found documents which had been signed by @entity4 when veteran bargain hunter @entity6 noticed some tattered pieces of parchment at a garage sale , curiosity got the better of her			1
she bought the documents for a measly $ 3 , but later discovered they date back to the @entity12 and that state officials from @entity14 had spent decades searching for them			2
the 52 - year - old from @entity17 found the 250 - year - old long - lost papers at the sale in @entity20 , @entity21 , but was unaware of their significance			1
she then discovered one document was written in 1710 and had the royal seal of the @entity26 court of @entity27 on it , while the other was signed by @entity4 , the illegitimate son of @entity29 in 1771			1
@entity6 thought she had ' hit the jackpot ' but now has to return the documents because they have been reported missing to a number of law enforcement agencies , including the @entity34			1
the garage sale had been one of several the veteran bargain hunter had visited that day			1
she asked how much the documents were and immediately purchased them , despite having no idea about their historical value			0
' i thought i hit the jackpot ; i was all excited , like i had a winning lottery ticket , ' @entity6 told the @entity46			1
' never in my lifetime would i have expected to come across anything like this			0
' then , i looked at the @entity14 website and felt like i was holding a lottery ticket that had expired			0
it has been suggested at least five of the six documents were reported stolen by the state of @entity14 to the @entity34 and other law - enforcement agencies			0
@entity6 added : ' that 's my kind of luck			1
' i thought ( the discovery of the 18th - century materials ) really knocked it out of the park			0
' but the @entity14 says , ' it belongs to us "			0
' officials have since requested for the materials to be returned and have asked @entity6 to post the documents so they can be authenticated			2
she has already emailed images of the papers and was told by officials ' they appear to be the real @entity69 '			2
history : the documents found dated back to the @entity12 which with the @entity72 in 1775 ( illustrated ) where the first skirmish between the @entity74 and @entity26 took place ' i want to do the right thing , ' she said			2
' but i do n't want to mail the documents			0
i do n't trust the mail			0
' @entity6 hopes to be compensated in some way for recovering the historic papers			1
@entity83 , vice president of the @entity84 , a firm that specializes in @entity74 and presidential historical documents , said : ' these pieces give a glimpse into the relationship between @entity89 and her colonies , in this case specifically @entity14			0
' if they are original , they are significant documents for this reason			0
' however , compared with the number of people who collect revolutionary war material , for example , the market for colonial @entity14 material is not as broad			0
' moreover , since these were acts passed annually , they would not be unique			0
' setting these documents aside , pieces signed by @entity4 are generally not particularly valuable , ranging from a few hundred to a couple thousand dollars ' this is primarily because to the general public @entity4 is famous only for being @entity29 's son			1
' one of @entity6 's documents , marked with the royal seal , gave the @entity112 's approval of ' @entity113 for ascertaining the @entity114 of the representatives to meet in @entity116			1
' other pages approved funds for ' doctor @entity29 , agent of this colony at the rate of one hundred pounds per anum , ' and for his ' excellency @entity121 at the rate of sixty pounds per @entity124 aforesaid for @entity125 during the @entity126 , provided he makes @entity128 or @entity129 the @entity127 of his residence			2
' @entity6 said the sellers of the papers were going to give any leftover documents to a good will store , so she believed she saved the historic papers .			1

@entity6 , 52 , was *browsing* a garage sale in @entity20 , @entity21
she found the papers in a *cardboard* *box* lying on a table
one was signed by @entity29 's illegitimate son , @entity4
