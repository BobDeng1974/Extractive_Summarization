one - eyed police killer @entity0 has had a £ 20,000 bounty placed on his remaining good eye by a criminal underworld boss who wants him attacked in prison			1
police believe the violent underworld feud behind @entity0 ’s killing spree is far from over now he has been jailed for murdering @entity9 and @entity10 , as well as pcs @entity11 , 23 , and @entity11 , 32			1
as the jury was considering its verdicts , @entity9 and @entity10 ’s grave at @entity14 was vandalised in a hammer attack			1
pictures of the shorts and flowers left by loved ones were scattered all over the plot			2
the rival gang leader is said to be sympathetic to the shorts , and has made the contract payable on the destruction of @entity0 ’s good right eye in prison			1
@entity0 is starting his whole life sentence segregated from other prisoners because of the continuing threat to his safety			2
in his criminal life @entity0 ’s false black onyx eye became a badge of pride and a mark of his hardman image on the streets of @entity57			1
he knew the false eye and the empty socket behind it – which had to be searched every time he came into court – looked menacing			0
attack : the father and son 's final resting place has been targeted with a hammer recently vandals : whoever attacked the grave also left these photographs strewn across the cemetery criminal associates say he would use it to intimidate other drug dealers			1
but mystery surrounds how he lost his left eye			1
some say it was badly damaged by a knuckleduster in a drunken bar - room brawl while others say it was knocked out in a fight with gangsters in @entity85			2
but a police source said officers were suspicious of the stories because there is no marking or scar tissue around his eye socket			2
they suspect his eye may have been ‘ plucked out ’ by a knife - wielding crime rival			1
the source added : ‘ he thought it made him look like a baddie out of a @entity99 film			0
he was definitely looking for a dramatic image and this fulfilled it			0
’ first crime scene : the first victim , @entity25 , was killed at the @entity106 pub in @entity14 at just before midnight images : police took pictures of these walls where @entity0 's grenades pitted them with shrapnel and smashed nearby window throwing glass everywhere @entity0 was subjected to twice - daily checks behind his false eye as part of the security operation surrounding his trial			1
during the trial , a source at @entity122 , better known as @entity122 , said : ‘ every time he comes in and every time he goes out of the building he must be searched and checked – including behind his eye			0
‘ because he is a category a prisoner , each time he leaves these walls he is strip - searched and he must take his eye out so we can look behind it for drugs or some sort of weapon or anything he should n’t have			0
‘ and every time he comes back from court he gets strip - searched again and he has to take his eye out again – and it p * * * * s him off			0
’ cold - blooded : @entity0 decided in advance he would kill the police , and eventually took lives of pc @entity11 ( left ) and pc @entity11 ( right ) after calling 999 claiming there was a burglary where he was hiding @entity0 's use of grenades during his killing spree was ‘ incredibly worrying ’ , said sir @entity146 , chief constable of @entity147			1
he said : ‘ it was military - style weaponry – grenades from a former war zone			0
the worry is that there are huge numbers of these weapons out there from other parts of the world and it is relatively easy for certain individuals to import them into this country			0
’ sources revealed that hand grenades , machine guns , bullets and even rockets were among a shocking array of firepower available on the black market			0
attack : @entity0 emptied the magazine of this @entity172 handgun and then dumped it by the bodies of the officers he had just fatally injured extraordinary : @entity147 discovered this stash of grenades inside a storm drain during @entity0 's 17 - week trial the ‘ shopping list ’ available to criminals means they can buy grenades for as little as £ 150 each , while semi-automatic handguns with bullets cost £ 250			1
military - issue assault rifles cost £ 500 to £ 1,000 while a magazine of bullets for the weapons costs anything from £ 5 to £ 50			0
grenades are the latest addition to the arsenal of criminals as they ramp up the ‘ terror quotient ’			0
@entity0 had an arsenal of @entity198 hand grenades and used four during his murderous spree which claimed the lives of four people last year			1
only last week police found a cache of ten grenades believed to be linked to @entity0 at an address in @entity57			2
police say the grenades used by @entity0 came from the former @entity207			2
the @entity198 is a fragmentation grenade which has 3,000 tiny steel balls packed into its shell which explode over a 50m radius			0
