a nurse has had her visa application rejected because her son has autism and , according to the @entity4 , would be a ' burden on the @entity7 health system '			1
@entity8 has lived in @entity7 since 2007 , when she arrived in the @entity10 town of @entity11 - a single mother wanting to become a nurse , in the hope of finding a better life for herself and for her baby			1
her son was diagnosed with autism at the age of two , six months after they arrived in @entity7 , but ms @entity20 says ' @entity22 is not a burden , he is a joy			1
' ms @entity20 ' worked for years ' , juggling part time jobs while she studied			2
she has worked her way up and has been promoted to a clinical position at @entity30 , working hard to help rehabilitate stroke and amputee patients			2
she says it is the only place he knows , and he only knows @entity49 being a nurse was not possible in the @entity40 , where university is only possible for ' the well - off families			0
' ' being in @entity7 changed everything for @entity22 and i , being a nurse was always a dream , ' ms @entity8 told @entity57			1
' coming here and becoming a nurse has given me assurance for our future and a sense of fulfilment			0
' but ms @entity20 explains the life she worked so hard to build for her little family could be taken away at any moment			1
' all of it could be taken away because the government thinks that children with autism are going to be more of a cost to @entity7 society than a benefit – but that 's just not true			1
ms @entity20 has made a petition and is appealing the decision to send herself and her son back to the @entity40 - a place where she has no family and no network of support			1
' everything is here for us			0
my work , our family , our home is here , @entity22 's school ... ' ms @entity20 's application for a @entity89 visa subclass 489 has been rejected by the @entity90 due to @entity22 's autism			1
the rejection letter states that @entity22 ' has a severe autism spectrum disorder , a condition that is likely to be permanent in nature '			2
it stated that he would likely need special education services , state disability services , @entity101 disability services and residential care services			0
' @entity22 would be likely to result in a significant cost to the @entity7 community in the areas of health care , ' the rejection letter said			1
a spokeswoman for mr @entity109 released a short statement to news.com.au about mrs @entity20 's case			1
' the visa was refused because the child did not meet the health requirement , ' the spokeswoman said			2
' the applicant was advised of her options for independent review of the decision			0
people can only seek ministerial intervention once a refusal decision has been upheld at merits review '			0
@entity22 is a ' very cheeky , happy little boy ' who is thriving at his specialised school in @entity11 ms @entity20 is appealing the decision – fighting for the life she has worked so hard for			1
but she says she is n't angry about the decision – she 's sad			2
' i feel sad , not angry , that they do n't know or understand what @entity131 is			1
' as a mother of a child with @entity131 , i know it is n't a disease you have to cure , but one you have to manage			1
' i have received so many messages from mums of children with @entity131 ; it 's very prevalent in @entity7 , ' ms @entity8 told @entity57			1
' @entity22 is a happy child with full of life attitude and can lighten the mood of a room with his presence			2
' the idea that he ca n't contribute because of his condition is just wrong			0
people with autism can be excellent at a whole range of things ; he just needs to be given a chance ! ' @entity22 loves bike riding , scootering , water – and @entity160 ! ' he loves to watch @entity163 videos of @entity160 and to borrow his uncle 's golf clubs and pretend to be @entity166 ! ' ms @entity20 is sad , not angry , that the @entity4 does not understand @entity131 , and says that her son deserves a chance due to @entity22 's autism , even minor changes to their routines troubles him , meaning having their deportation would cause enormous issues for the little boy			1
' @entity22 notices any change to his routine			2
even if i drive him a different route to school , he 'll notice and react with a tantrum			0
but once you calm him down he 's fine			0
' but if we 're asked to go back to the @entity40 , we 'd have to start from scratch			0
he only knows life in @entity7			2
' when asked about their possible deportation , @entity8 is lost for words			0
' i have no answer to that question			0
i ca n't think about it			0
' i ca n't see myself going home			0
i probably just have to cross that bridge when i get there			0
ms @entity20 lives with her brother and his wife , with her mother only fifteen minutes away - or as ms @entity20 explains it ' just a phone call away '			2
they are a crucial support for her and adored by @entity22			0
ms @entity20 says there is no support for them in @entity22 , compared to @entity7 , where her beloved mother , brother , sister - in - law , aunty , uncle and cousins live			1
@entity22 is very happy with them , and are a crucial support for ms @entity20 , including caring for @entity22 when ms @entity20 is on night shift			1
' i have found a better life for my family in @entity7 with my close family			2
my mother , stepfather and @entity22 's uncle and aunty are so important for @entity22 and @entity222 ' they are a big help , as any single mum would understand			1
' but to go back - the @entity40 is a third world country			0
ms @entity228 ( pictured second from the left , in pink ) and her son @entity22 ( centre , in blue cap ) say they have ' never felt lonely ' in @entity7 , despite their challenges , because of all the support they have been given the mother has been ' overwhelmed ' by the support since she made her change.org petition , and hopes the @entity4 reconsider their decision to deport her son			1
' i 'm hoping for compassion form the tribunal and from the minister for immigration			0
' i 'm wondering if they can change the immigration law about people in situations like this			0
there must be other people who have been affected by it before me			0
' ms @entity20 says that through all her challenges , @entity7 has been a safe , caring place for her and her son			1
' i have a lot of support from the community			0
i have never felt alone			0
