for most people , winning the lottery means living the rest of their lives in the lap of luxury			2
but for @entity6 - who won £ 1.2million - splashing the cash on designer clothes and sipping champagne all day was n’t for her			1
instead , the mother - of - one decided to become a pig farmer - and , although she is up at the crack of dawn and often knee - deep in mud , she has never been happier			2
cradling a piglet @entity6 , 46 , said : ' winning the lottery was amazing but the first time i brought a piglet into the world , i felt i ’d hit the jackpot			1
@entity6 won £ 1.2million on the lottery but decided to become a pig farmer rather than lead a lavish life ' friends think i ’m crazy			1
it ’s a dirty seven - day job in all weathers			2
some of the piglets need 24 - hour attention and there are days when i only manage to get a few hours sleep			2
but the pigs bring me more satisfaction than any money ever could			2
' before her numbers came up in january 2010 , @entity6 was a hairdresser in the village of @entity36 , near @entity37			1
she said : ' then although i struggled financially i was perfectly groomed - my clothes and make up were always carefully picked out			1
' now i always smell of pigs and ironically these days i buy most of my clothes from second - hand charity shops			1
' a typical day for @entity6 begins at 6.30am when she gets up with partner @entity41 , 47 , to tend the 7,000 pigs on his family farm near @entity44			1
when @entity6 won the lottery in 2010 , she was a hairdresser but decided to become a pig farmer with her partner @entity6 , who has invested her winnings in property , added : ' i always imagined if i won the lottery i 'd buy a new car and clothes			1
but the reality is i still love hunting for bargains - and i ’ve discovered i love pigs ' she said : ' every three weeks around 1,000 new piglets are born			1
some of them need bottle feeding hourly to survive			0
so it ’s often midnight before i sink into bed			0
' it ’s definitely not the usual life of a millionaire lottery winner and if you ’d told me before i won the lottery this was how i ’d spend my days , i would have said , " no way "			1
' @entity6 was a single mother desperately trying to save up enough money to get a mortgage when her numbers came up			1
' it was teatime and i was just about to have dinner when i glanced at the tv and saw the winning numbers , ' she recalls , ' they looked familiar - i always used the same ones - and i got my ticket out to check			2
' to say i could n’t believe my eyes is an understatement but i suddenly could n’t eat a thing			0
' after verifying she had indeed won £ 1,182,714 , she celebrated with a drink in the pub and some karaoke			1
@entity6 was a single mother desperately trying to save up enough money to get a mortgage when her numbers came up - now she 's penned a book , too ' all i could think of was that i no longer had to fret about whether i ’d get a mortgage as i did n’t need one , ' she said			1
. in fact , it was n’t a total surprise to friends as just weeks before @entity6 had posted on @entity92 that she was sure she was going to win the lottery			1
' a few weeks earlier i was at a party when i had my tarot cards done for fun			0
after the last card was revealed she actually told me the world was my oyster			0
all my dreams were within reach and i should buy a lottery ticket			0
' a few weeks later i met her again and she made the same prediction			0
she was so sure i would win soon that i believed her and made sure i bought a ticket every week			0
' even so , at first she could n't come to terms with her win			2
' most lottery winners take a holiday but for the first six months i just kept on going to work at my hairdressing salon as normal			0
' nine months before her win she ’d begun dating pig farmer @entity41 , an old friend			0
but with 220 miles between them it was difficult to see one another regularly			0
she explained : ' six months after my win - and wanting desperately to see @entity41 - i suddenly thought what am i doing ? i ’ve been given this wonderful gift of a lottery win and i need to make the most of it			1
i put the salon up for sale that day			0
' she and son @entity121 , now 22 , moved to @entity41 ’s farm but she had no desire to become involved with the pigs			0
' while it was wonderful to live on his father ’s pig farm , i found the smell of the pigs overwhelming , ' she says , ' and i could n’t imagine being in muck all day			0
' however , one day she had an overwhelming urge to see how a female pig was getting on giving birth			0
' at first i could n’t bring myself to touch her but @entity41 's dad @entity135 said if i did n’t help , both the mother and the piglets would die			0
i eventually pulled the piglet out alive			0
the sense of relief and joy was overwhelming and i ’ve never looked back			0
' @entity6 , who has invested her winnings in property , added : ' i always imagined if i won the lottery i ’d buy a new car and clothes			1
but the reality is i still love hunting for bargains - and i ’ve discovered i love pigs			2
