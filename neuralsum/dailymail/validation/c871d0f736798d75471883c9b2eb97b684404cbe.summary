@entity1 gov. @entity0 tops likely @entity4 voters ' 2016 lists for second week in row			1
a handful of flubs and a flip - flop that were heavily covered by the media do n't seem to have slowed down the second - term governor 's momentum in the invisible presidential primary , and in a national @entity14 poll released on thursday @entity0 came in first with 18 percent			1
former @entity16 gov. @entity15 , previously considered the @entity4 front - runner , was right behind him at 16 percent			1
@entity1 governor @entity0 addresses the @entity19 's @entity18 ( @entity20 ) at @entity21 , @entity22 , last week			1
@entity0 did n't win the @entity20 straw poll , but he has topped national 2016 polls for the last two weeks just two weeks ago it was @entity15 who was leading @entity0 by an average of two points in early primary states			1
but by the time the right - wing of the party made its annual pilgrimage to the @entity33 metropolitan area for the @entity18 last weekend , it was @entity0 who was carrying the @entity4 's torch			2
a @entity36 survey released a day before the soft start of the convention found that 25 percent of the @entity4 had coalesced around @entity1 's chief executive			2
retired neurosurgeon @entity40 , who earlier this week became the first @entity4 to launch a presidential exploratory committee , made a surprise second showing in that poll , taking 18 percent of the vote , as @entity15 slipped to third place			1
this week @entity15 was back on @entity0 's heels , though , as the @entity1 governor took flak over comments he made about president @entity51 's patriotism and religion , protesters in his state and illegal immigration			1
as pollsters for @entity14 began their survey , @entity0 was asked by the @entity58 if believes that @entity51 loves his country			1
the question was related to remarks former @entity63 mayor @entity62 made at a @entity63 dinner honoring @entity0 during which the failed presidential candidate suggested the commander in chief does n't have the same level of deference to @entity69 as the rest of his countrymen			2
' you should ask the president what he thinks about @entity69 , ' @entity0 told @entity58 when he was approached about @entity62 's comments during a @entity33 meeting of the nation 's governors			2
' i 've never asked him so i do n't know			0
' that same weekend @entity0 told the @entity80 he could n't possibly know whether @entity51 is a @entity81 or not			2
' i 've never asked him that , ' @entity0 said			0
' you 've asked me to make statements about people that i have n't had a conversation with about that			0
how [ could ] i say if i know either of you are a @entity81 ? ' @entity15 shakes @entity20 attendees ' hands at last weekend 's convention			2
@entity15 , previously considered the @entity4 front - runner , was right behind @entity0 in this week 's presidential survey , taking 16 percent to @entity0 's 18 percent from there , his week did n't get much better			1
asked at @entity20 what qualifies him to take on terrorists , @entity0 brought up his 2012 fight with public sector unions			0
democrats in @entity1 tried to recall him over measures , however @entity0 won statewide election again , with an even wider margin of victory that he did the first time			0
' if i can do that with 100,000 protesters , i can do the same across the world , ' he said			0
the comments were interpreted by some reporters as a comparison between his home state critics an savages in the @entity112 - something his political action committee told @entity114 in an email that was neither fair nor true			0
then , on sunday , he walked back his position on immigration , saying he no longer believes in a pathway to citizenship for illegal residents			0
' i do n't believe in amnesty , ' @entity0 told @entity122			2
' my view has changed			0
i 'm flat out saying it			0
' still , other @entity4 whose names were tested by @entity14 attracted less than half as much support as @entity0 did in the recent poll			1
tied for third were @entity132 gov. @entity131 and former @entity134 gov. @entity133 with eight percent each			0
@entity40 took 7 percent of the mock vote , and a trio of senators who are expected to run - @entity138 of @entity139 , @entity136 of @entity140 and @entity141 of @entity16 - received between five and six percent of @entity4 ' support			1
@entity138 's showings in surveys throughout the last month have n't been as strong as some of his likely competitors ' , @entity0 and @entity15 included , but at @entity20 it was the freshman lawmaker who claimed victory as his team showed off its organizing prowess and secured him his third straw poll win in three years			1
straw poll winners rarely go on to wrap up the nomination			0
@entity138 's unique ability to turn out his supporters will prove beneficial in caucus states like @entity158 , however .			0
