by @entity0 former @entity2 mp @entity1 said he was ' ashamed ' as he announced he was to quit @entity3			1
@entity4 faces the prospect of a nightmare by - election showdown with @entity8 after shamed @entity2 mp @entity1 quit last night			1
the former @entity2 frontbencher said he would step down immediately after a sleaze inquiry ruled he should be suspended from @entity3 for six months over his involvement in a lobbying scandal			2
his decision will spark a @entity2 showdown with @entity16 this summer in what is normally a safe @entity19 seat in @entity20 , @entity21			1
@entity16 leader @entity8 said last night he would ‘ seriously ’ consider standing himself , despite facing a @entity19 majority of more than 16,000			2
the seat went to @entity24 in 1997 during the first @entity26 landslide but returned to the @entity2 in 2001			2
local @entity2 scotched suggestions of @entity28 being selected , saying they had already chosen businessman @entity29 to fight the seat			2
it is unlikely that a by - election would be held before next month ’s @entity34 elections			1
senior conservatives privately urged mr @entity1 to serve out his term as mp rather than sparking a damaging by - election			1
but the bitter personal enmity between mr @entity1 and mr @entity4 meant their pleas fell on deaf ears			2
in a statement last night , mr @entity1 said he was ‘ ashamed ’ of his behaviour			1
the former @entity45 colonel said that as an ex-soldier he believes that when you have done something wrong you should confess to it			0
he added : ‘ no point in shilly - shallying or trying to avoid it			1
what has happened has happened , i ’m ashamed of it			1
therefore , i ’m going to do what i can to put it right			0
i ’m going to resign my seat			0
’ former @entity2 mp @entity1 speaks outside the @entity57 , @entity58 , as he announces his resignation @entity2 mp @entity1 faces being kicked out of the @entity61 for six months mr @entity1 resigned the conservative whip last year after he was caught in a lobbying sting			1
he was filmed agreeing a £ 2,000 - a - month contract to represent undercover reporters posing as lobbyists representing businesses seeking to end @entity69 ’s suspension from the @entity70			1
@entity1 spent 25 years as an army officer with the @entity72 and @entity73 , serving in @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			0
as the youngest colonel since the @entity78 he left the army in 1999 and soon after joined @entity82 's today programme as their defence reporter			0
he was elected as @entity2 mp for @entity20 in 2001 , and served on the frontbench under @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity4			1
but he was sacked by mr @entity4 in 2007 for an interview in which he suggested that being called a ' black b * * * * * d ' was a normal part of army life			0
he also claimed to have met a lot of ' idle and useless ' soldiers from ethnic minorities			0
since then , mr @entity1 has been an outspoken critic of the @entity2 leader			0
in 2011 he was reported to have called mr @entity4 ' an a * * * ' and ' a despicable creature without any real redeeming features '			0
a recording obtained by @entity99 suggested he also said of the pm : ' i ’ve never , ever come across anyone less suited to the job in my life			0
i would take a beggar off the streets and put him in that position rather than have @entity4			0
' however , mr @entity1 denied the veracity of the account and accused the newspaper of subterfuge			1
he is said to have tabled five parliamentary questions and a @entity61 motion on behalf of the bogus lobbyists after they paid him £ 4,000			1
he was caught on film telling them : ‘ i do not charge a great deal of money for these things			1
i would normally come out at £ 500 per half day , so £ 1,000 a day			0
’ a @entity120 on mr @entity1 ’s case is due to report tomorrow			0
but its conclusion that he should face a six - month ban from @entity3 leaked to the media last night			1
mr @entity1 was once seen as a rising star of the @entity19 , but had a catastrophic falling out with mr @entity4 the @entity2 leader fired him as shadow homeland security minister in 2007 after he was reported saying he had met a lot of ‘ idle and useless ’ ethnic minority soldiers during his @entity45 career and he claimed that racism was ‘ part and parcel ’ of @entity45 life			1
the sacking created a lasting enemy on the @entity2 benches			0
in 2011 mr @entity1 reportedly described the prime minister as a ‘ despicable creature ’			1
his decision to force a by - election is viewed by some in @entity2 central office as a final act of spite			2
in recent years , the main parties have called by - elections as quickly as possible to prevent @entity16 having time to gather momentum			2
but last night @entity2 sources confirmed the by - election could not be held on the same day as the @entity3 elections on may 22			2
the earliest it can be held is may 29 , but it could well slip into june			0
the timing means the @entity2 will now have to fight the contest in the wake of the @entity34 elections , in which they are widely expected to trail behind @entity16			0
last night , a @entity16 source said : ‘ we are watching the situation with very close attention			0
if there is a by - election very soon after the @entity34 elections it would be a big deal , particularly if @entity16 has given the @entity2 a bloody nose			2
we would want to run a serious and impressive candidate			0

@entity20 mp *referred* himself to the @entity61 *standards* *comittee* last year
shadow minister was caught up in cash - for - questions probe
accused of agreeing to set up group at request of undercover reporters
now admits he is ' ashamed ' telling reporters there was ' no point in shilly shallying '
