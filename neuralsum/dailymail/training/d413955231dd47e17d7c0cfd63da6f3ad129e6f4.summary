by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 could have pioneered the world 's first 3d image by painting two similar portraits of the @entity7 , it has been claimed			1
the @entity9 artist produced two almost identical copies , which when viewed next to one another would create the impression of depth , according to @entity15 art researchers			1
the effect would reportedly be similar to superimposed images used today to create the impression of three - dimensional drawings , which are often viewed with red and blue tinted glasses			1
artworks : @entity3 could have pioneered the world 's first 3d image by painting two similar portraits of the @entity7 - the famous @entity7 at the @entity23 ( left ) and the ' @entity24 ' ( right ) , it is claimed the extraordinary theory was revealed in a paper by @entity27 and @entity28 , according to the @entity29			1
it relies on a similar painting to the @entity7 - unveiled in 2012 - being produced by the artist himself rather than a student , as has been theorised			1
the researchers analysed the copy , called the ' @entity24 ' , at the @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity39 , as well as the famous portrait of @entity7 that hangs at @entity42 's @entity23 museum			1
they discovered there was a slight perspective shift between the artworks - with the painter ( or painters ) having created them from different vantage points			0
difference : @entity15 reseachers discovered there was a slight perspective shift between the artworks - with the painter ( s ) having created them from different vantage points of around 2.7 inches in horizontal distance these points measured around 2.7 inches in horizontal distance - which is similar to the average distance between a person 's eyes , they found			2
' when i first perceived the two paintings @entity65 , it was very obvious for me that there is a very small but evident difference in perspectives , ' mr @entity27 , of the @entity62 in @entity15 , told @entity70			0
' this is particularly clear if you observe the chair on which @entity7 sits : in the @entity37 version , you can still see the end of the end corner of the chair at the background of the painting , which you can not see in the @entity23 version			2
' copy : the theory relies on the ' @entity24 ' being produced by the artist himself			1
the difference in vantage points is reportedly ' particularly clear ' if you observe ' the end of the end corner ' ( circled ) of @entity7 's chair he said this was because the painter of @entity37 @entity7 - supposedly , @entity3 himself - had been positioned more to the left than the creator of the @entity23 artwork			1
the researchers then cited the manner in which our eyes perceive objects at varying perspectives , before sending individual , flat images to our brain to be translated into one three - dimensional picture			2
using this notion , they concluded that the two paintings , when viewed together , could present the first stereoscopic image in the world			2
study : the researchers used a red - cyan anaglyph to combine the two paintings of the @entity7 ( pictured ) the researchers added that they had used a red - cyan anaglyph to combine the two portraits - and it had backed their theory that the finished product portrayed depth			1
but they admitted it was impossible to know whether the stereoscopic masterpiece was a coincidence , or whether @entity3 had knowingly created it as part of a science project			0
three - dimensional ? they claimed the finished product ( pictured ) backed their theory that the paintings , when viewed together , portrayed depth as well as creating artworks such as ' @entity128 ' and ' the vitruvian man ' , @entity3 is also renowned for his work in the fields of anatomy , geology , mathematics and literature , among others			1
he was one of the greatest anatomists the world had ever seen - with his intricate knowledge of the human body demonstrated in a collection of notebooks which he filled with detailed studies of organs , bones , vessels and muscles			0
in february this year , it was revealed that @entity151 art detectives are a step closer to identifying the lady behind the artist 's famous @entity7 portrait			1
dna tests are underway on bones that may belong to a @entity158 noblewoman , named @entity159 , who is widely believed to be the model for the painting			0
historian @entity162 has taken samples from a skeleton in @entity165 near @entity158 and is comparing them to @entity166 from the bones of some of @entity159 's confirmed relatives			0
if a dna match is made , professor @entity162 will make a 3d reconstruction of @entity159 's face from the skull , as well as details in @entity3 ’s @entity7 painting			1
the results from the analysis should be ready by may or june , the professor told the @entity178			0
@entity159 is thought to have posed for the painting between 1503 and 1506			0
@entity3 is best known for his stunning artwork but the @entity181 had many talents			2
he was also a sculptor , architect , musician , mathematician , engineer , inventor , anatomist , geologist , cartographer , botanist , and writer			0
the @entity7 is his most famous and most parodied portrait while his painting of @entity128 is the most reproduced religious painting of all time			1
@entity3 's drawing of the @entity198 is also regarded as a cultural icon - being reproduced on items as varied as the euro coin , textbooks , and t - shirts			0
only around fifteen of his paintings survive because of his constant , and frequently disastrous , experimentation with new techniques , and his chronic procrastination			0
@entity3 is also revered for his technological ingenuity			0
he conceptualised a helicopter , a tank , concentrated solar power , a calculator , and the double hull , also outlining a rudimentary theory of plate tectonics			2
relatively few of his designs were constructed or were even feasible during his lifetime , but some of his smaller inventions , such as an automated bobbin winder and a machine for testing the tensile strength of wire , entered the world of manufacturing unheralded			0
he made important discoveries in anatomy , civil engineering , optics , and hydrodynamics , but he did not publish his findings and they had no direct influence on later science .			0

@entity9 artist painted two similar images of @entity7 , it is claimed
when viewed together , works reportedly create the impression of depth
effect similar to superimposed images used today to make 3d drawings
theory relies on the copy of famous @entity7 being produced by artist
the artwork , known as ' @entity24 ' is housed in museum in @entity38
