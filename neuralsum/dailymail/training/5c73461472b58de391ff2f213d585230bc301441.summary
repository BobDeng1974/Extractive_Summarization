shadow chancellor @entity0 said wants to hit better - off homeowners with the mansion tax in the next financial year @entity3 has asked the @entity4 to start drawing up plans to levy its mansion tax on 100,000 expensive homes from day one of regaining power			1
despite a revolt from some @entity11 over the annual levy , shadow chancellor @entity0 said he aimed to hit better - off homeowners in the next financial year			2
although it is unusual for a tax to be introduced in the course of a financial year , mr @entity0 said he wanted to start raising money from the rich in order to plough it into the @entity22 as quickly as possible			1
he said @entity4 officials were already working on the proposals , in line with the civil service practice of making plans to implement the policies of parties that could win a forthcoming election			0
@entity3 and @entity32 plans for a mansion tax had been in doubt after @entity36 ’s dramatic reform of stamp duty at the @entity38 , which have made buying a home worth £ 1million or more far more expensive			1
@entity41 dem business secretary @entity40 said his party would stick with its policy of an annual levy – but suggested it may have to be amended following the chancellor ’s changes			0
labour opponents of the party ’s own mansion tax scheme have also stepped up their campaign to persuade mr @entity0 to shift his position			1
but the @entity0 insisted in an interview with the @entity53 : ‘ saving the @entity22 will be at the heart of our first budget			2
i would like to see that revenue coming in in the first year of a @entity3 government , before the end of the financial year			2
we will have to see the practicalities			0
’ mr @entity0 denied charges could be imposed retrospectively			2
‘ a charge is paid in that year on the valuation on a date in that year			0
no one will have any doubt about our intentions , ’ he insisted			0
the @entity69 has sought to undermine mr @entity0 ’s pledge to raise £ 2.5billion for the @entity22 through a combination of the mansion tax , a levy on tobacco firms and reducing tax avoidance by hedge funds by announcing its own £ 3billion boost			1
critics also pointed out that revenues from these measures were unlikely to start flowing in until the middle of the next @entity83			0
however , mr @entity0 said @entity3 could legislate for the mansion tax to start in the following financial year of 2016 - 17 ‘ as a backstop ’			1
@entity3 ’s mansion tax will be about £ 3,000 a year for homes in the £ 2million to £ 3million bracket			1
experts say an average charge of £ 11,000 a year will need to be levied to raise the £ 1.2billion a year @entity3 predicts			0
the @entity92 claim it will be extended to cover cheaper properties .			0

it is unusual for tax to be introduced in the course of the financial year
