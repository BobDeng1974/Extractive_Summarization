by @entity0 the watching world were treated to a celebration of colour , dance and music as @entity6 officially unleashed the @entity7			1
the location ? @entity9 , @entity6			1
the reason ? kick - starting the world 's greatest tournament , and in some style too			0
much was debated as to whether @entity6 would be up to hosting the @entity7 but , judging by this opening ceremony , they seem to be off to a fairly good start			1
host commentator right , that 's my bit done for now			0
i 'll hand you over to @entity22 , who will bring you full live commentary on @entity6 vs @entity24 here			1
and with that , @entity25 and her co-performers run , smiling and waving , from the field and the opening ceremony draws to a close			1
that was a short affair , but very sweet and colourful and we now have just over an over until the match between @entity6 and @entity24 gets underway			1
and now the ball in the middle of the pitch has split into segments to reveal , oh yes , @entity25 belting out the official @entity7 song ' we are one ( @entity40 ) ' alongside @entity41			1
she 's wearing a very revealing green sequin dress and looking very fine indeed			0
he 's wearing white trousers that look uncomfortably high			0
we 've also got the delightful @entity45 on stage in a blue sparkly dress			1
now , at last , the ceremony acknowledges that a football tournament is about to take place as kids in the colours of the 32 nations make their way into the middle and show off some juggling skills with a ball on an elastic string			2
the colourful globe in the middle going mad now , showing the flags of all the countries and then the @entity62 , the official ball of the competition			0
now a demonstration of the traditional and very exciting @entity6 martial art of @entity67			1
@entity69 's players tried their hand at it when they toured @entity71 the other day			0
we 've now moved on from the nature phase to celebrate the rich diversity of @entity6 , with hundreds of performers in bright costumes twirling around and dancing to a classic @entity6 rhythm			2
the preparations for the opening ceremony as thorough as for the tournament itself			1
workshops to find and train those taking part tonight started back in march and there have been some 84 hours of rehearsals to get them fully drilled and in sync			0
at the moment , the rather mesmerizing ball continues to swirl and glow in its many colours as everyone dances around			0
some are on trampolines and some in canoes , each aspect designed to reflect a part of @entity6 life			2
the opening ceremony underway now in @entity9 and , at the moment , we have lots of people dressed as trees and flowers striding their way across the very colourful stage			1
in the centre of it all , a swirling multi-coloured ball serves as an eye - catching centrepiece			0
each of the props used in tonight 's ceremony has been designed with an even weight distribution so as not to cause any damage to the playing surface here			2
if you 've seen the shocking state of the pitch in @entity120 , where @entity69 will play @entity121 on saturday , you 'll know this is very wise indeed			2
a little bit of time - keeping for you - the opening ceremony is expected to get underway at 7.15pm @entity127 time ( so very shortly indeed ) and will last about 25 minutes or so			1
there will then be quite a lot of time for @entity131 and his @entity133 colleagues to fill until the actual kick - off at 9pm			0
@entity135 : while coaches speak of the value of experience at a @entity7 , it is inevitably the lesser heard - of young players who provide some of every tournament ’s stand - out moments			2
@entity143 has made the effort to inject his squad with young talent to spring a surprise on @entity69 ’s opponents , but across the competition other countries are doing the same with not - so - big names looking to make an impact			0
so looking ahead , here ’s 10 players you might not have heard of who can light up the @entity7			2

from referees squirting shaving foam on the pitch to mystic turtles , here 's @entity163 with a top ten of things you will see at the @entity7 for the first time this summer			2
and , yes , he has included @entity69 winning a penalty shoot - out			0
to be fair , we are long overdue a taste of success from 12 yards			0

the @entity7 kicks off this evening , the pomp and pageantry of the opening ceremony at the @entity9 leading in to the first course - @entity6 vs @entity24			1
