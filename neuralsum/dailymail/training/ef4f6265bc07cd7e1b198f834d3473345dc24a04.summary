few things in life frighten me , but dying before my time is one of them			1
to achieve my dream of longevity , i lead a relatively healthy life , exercising daily , drinking in moderation , eating plenty of fruit and veg , and — most important of all — shunning fatty foods including butter and dairy products to reduce the risk of heart disease			1
well , that ’s turned out to be a huge waste of time ! the truth is , i shall probably die at exactly the same age as my mum and dad , and i will have wasted decades on a virtuous eating plan based on a lie			2
this week , we were told that the advice dished out by doctors in 1983 — that to avoid heart disease we must cut our fat intake drastically , and increase our carbs correspondingly — turns out to be based on flawed evidence			1
( just as shockingly , women were n’t even included in the original survey ! ) i ca n’t tell you how annoyed i am by this news , having spent all those years since 1983 eating slimy , flavourless , low - fat spreads , cutting down on meat and never roasting my spuds in beef dripping , completely taken in by ‘ official advice ’ from ‘ government health advisers ’			1
drinking black tea , not eating trifle , spurning custard and never dripping cream on my crumble			2
i was totally brainwashed about butter , along with millions of you			2
the dairy industry never recovered from the dietary warnings of 1983 — milk sales plummeted , along with those of butter , and supermarkets drastically increased the amount of shelf - space devoted to low - fat spreads , zero - fat yogurt and skimmed milk			1
unsurprisingly , the dairy industry is now in crisis , and in @entity80 , poor @entity79 has had to flog off four of his cows because he ca n’t make a living from the herd , while @entity84 ca n’t find a buyer for his milk round			1
it ’s not surprising when on any given day you ’ll hear yet another celebrity proudly announce that they ’ve given up dairy as part of their healthy eating regime			2
@entity95 has become horribly , unfairly demonised — and all because of bogus medical advice			1
@entity34 says that spreads such as @entity98 taste like ' taste like slimy muck ' but then , when it comes to lifestyle advice , why should anyone bother listening to the medical profession ? doctors are usually over-weight , middle - aged men with flushed faces and paunches , although my own @entity109 doctor is the opposite			1
he ’s a fitness fanatic , a fell - runner so scrawny he looks on the point of death every time i walk through the door			0
he ’s always got the fat - measuring callipers handy , to check my body mass index			2
( another discredited method , incidentally , of measuring how near to death we are )			0
for years now , both @entity125 and @entity126 governments have decided to interfere and tell us what we should eat , what we should weigh , and how often we should exercise			0
sod the economy , they seem to be thinking , let ’s focus on the nation ’s blood pressure ! politicians have become like the extra foster - mum we never wanted			0
by the way , both my parents ate thick slabs of butter on white bread with every meal			0
they loved salad cream slathered over their lettuce			0
they gorged on tinned ham , tongue , huge joints of red meat every sunday , potatoes roasted in animal fat , and meat and offal at least five times a week			2
yes , we ate fish on fridays — usually in batter from the chippy , with chips cooked in dripping — and the idea of a wholemeal grain or a low - fat vegetarian meal was a completely alien concept back in @entity164			2
they took sugar in tea , and salt was always on the table			0
yet , both parents were as thin as rakes and walked for miles well into old age , even if they did smoke			0
but then i regularly meet healthy pensioners over 80 who survive on full - fat milky tea and bread and butter , interspersed with the odd ciggie and a glass of beer or gin			1
my generation of baby boomers decided we did n’t want to age like them or get wrinkly and stooped , so we adopted every life - extending fad going , starting with no saturated fat			1
i love the taste of butter — particularly on crumpets — but a packet of butter now lasts three months in my fridge			0
it sits unloved on a special shelf , next to that other devil food , creamy @entity199 , which i only eat when i ’ve had several glasses of red wine too many			0
@entity34 says although she loves the taste of butter on crumpets , a packet of butter now lasts three months in her fridge full fat cheese is like a class a drug to me — a super-evil			1
i am a total food snob , so how i ever persuaded myself that low - fat spreads were delicious is a mystery , no matter what twaddle @entity211 claimed in her advertising campaign extolling the benefits of the @entity216 ‘ cholesterol - lowering ’ range			1
let ’s be honest , all these spreads taste like slimy muck			0
and now we ’re told we have been smearing them over our wholegrain for no reason at all			0
this strategy of demonising fats was shown to be a sham last year when the @entity227 concluded that @entity229 dietary guidelines on fat needed rethinking			2
and yet the government did nothing			0
common sense dictates that eating too much fat ca n’t be good for us , but the advice in dietary guidelines — which substituted carbohydrates for fats — just seems to have been scribbled out on the back of an envelope			1
and if the levels of obesity now plaguing the population are anything to go by , the advice has been totally counter-productive			2
@entity34 says full fat cheese is a like a class a drug to her and that @entity199 is reserved for when she 's had several too many glasses of red wine my beef with all this is that it ’s just tinkering around the edges			1
instead of promoting cookery lessons in schools ( they ’re starting this year at long last ) and encouraging people to enjoy all sorts of food and use unprocessed ingredients , the government prefers to waste millions of tax - payers money trying to encourage us to change our behaviour using ‘ nudge ’ tactics like giving people vouchers for free slimming classes			1
@entity267 said he would slash government advertising when he took office , but spent a whopping £ 90 million in the 11 months to november 2013 , up from £ 64 million during 2013 , and almost double what was spent in 2011			0
we are bombarded with public health messages about ‘ healthy eating ’ in every ad break on telly			1
@entity275 was set up by @entity276 in 2009 and made a big expensive fuss about the benefits of eating five fruit and veg a day			0
last june , the @entity281 and @entity282 concluded that only ten per cent of boys and seven per cent of girls had heeded that advice			2
yes , a million people have downloaded the app , and 1.9 million families joined the scheme — but when it came to actually eating fruit and veg , the average number of portions a day we consume remains at three — and , like the great @entity296 , experts ca n’t agree whether it should be five portions , or seven , or what even constitutes a portion			1
as for me , i ’m too set in my ways to change			0
my longevity breakfast will remain raw tomatoes or mashed avocado on a slice of heavy , seed - laden wholemeal bread , with chopped anchovies , slathered in olive oil			0
i ca n’t remember what health ‘ advice ’ brought me to this point , but i ’m not stopping now			1
@entity313 forbid that in a moment of terrible weakness i might even start living dangerously and buy another packet of butter			0
the moral of this saga ? eat a little of whatever you like , do n’t listen to government busybodies — and remember that butter ’s not only delicious , it ’s also officially good for you .			0

@entity34 leads a healthy life , *excercising* daily and shunning fatty foods
advice from doctors suggested cutting fat intake to avoid heart disease
medical experts have reversed their opinion , given the poor data
only a small number of ‘ unhealthy men ’ were *questioned* originally
