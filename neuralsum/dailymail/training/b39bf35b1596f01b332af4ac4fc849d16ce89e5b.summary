by @entity0 for @entity1 a pioneering crook got away with £ 24,000 after @entity4 fake cashpoints facades , only to be caught because he used his own card to test them out			1
the thief , named @entity8 , used the printer to make fake fronts for atm machines so he could clone hundreds of people 's cards			1
when unsuspecting members of the public put their cards into the cashpoints in @entity19 and @entity20 , southern @entity21 , they also put them through a ' skimmer ' which was hidden by the 34 - year - old fraudster			2
the machine would then dispense cash as normal , leaving the user completely unaware that their details had been stolen			0
a police source told @entity39 : ' the fake fronts were of a good quality and were different to those we normally see			1
' @entity8 was on the run with £ 24,000 of stolen money before the scam came to light when the bank discovered the false fronts			1
police tracked him down as he had used his own credit card in the machine to test whether it worked			1
he was arrested in @entity53 this month			0
when the police found the 3d printer at his home he admitted to the scam and has been charged with fraud			2
in september 2011 an @entity60 gang were prosecuted after stealing more than £ 241,000 by using the same 3d - printed fake atm fronts scam			2
a gang in @entity63 were also caught out after scamming £ 56,000 from card users with a similar ploy			0
criminals have also used the revolutionary printers to make keys and guns			0
however the machines have been put to good use too , to make objects including houses , replacement knees , and even ' mini-me ' models			0
3d printers , such as this @entity78 , can now be bought for home use			0
it is thought that the thief used a much larger 3d printer to make the fake @entity84 fronts , which were used in @entity19 and @entity20 , southern @entity21			1

*man* , known only as @entity8 , made atm facades with a 3d printer
