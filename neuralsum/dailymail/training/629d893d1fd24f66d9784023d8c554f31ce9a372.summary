by @entity1 reporter with a globe of light illuminating each wingtip , and a fierce tongue of fire spouting from beneath , this hovering aircraft has been compared to an extraterrestrial visitor			2
it is the latest test of the high - tech warplane that the @entity11 and its allies are funding to maintain the @entity14 's aerial dominance far into the 21st century			1
a video shows the @entity16 making its first night landing at sea , using its vertical landing capabilities to gently touch down on the deck of the @entity21			1
the jet combines advanced stealth features with fighter speed and agility , with its @entity37 capabilities enabling it to operate from a wider range of ships			0
the landing shown in the video was carried out by @entity55 test pilot lieutenant colonel @entity53 ' @entity52 , a @entity56 pilot by training			1
' it all went extremely well , ' he said			2
' eight successful landings in one night , so we ’re tracking favorably along the learning curve			0
' during the 18 - day long ship trials , which began on august 14 , two @entity62 were to conduct a series of tests to determine the aircraft ’s suitability for sea - based operations			1
they also included the first take - off and landing at sea by an @entity74 test pilot , squadron leader @entity73 , with the @entity75 earmarking £ 250billion for a fleet of the jets due to be in operation by 2018			1
squadron leader @entity73 said : ' it 's exciting to see the integration of this new plane with the amphibious assault ships			0
' after a year leading up to this evolution , it 's awesome to get here and start			0
and the crew has been especially accommodating and efficient at running these tests smoothly ' take - off : during the 18 - day long ship trials , which began on august 14 , two @entity62 were to conduct a series of tests to determine the aircraft ¿ s suitability for sea - based operations the movable afterburner at the rear of @entity96 means it is also able to take off from very short runways captain @entity99 , director of test & evaluation for the @entity101 , added : ' it 's a significant milestone for the f - 35 programme			1
' we 're providing an envelope that will be utilised by @entity55 and @entity75 aviators when they go out and employ the aircraft in a real environment			0
february 19 : all f - 35s grounded after crack found on low pressure turbine blade of @entity113 variant warplane january 16 : @entity55 ' @entity114 suspended for nearly one month after single engine failed during test flight in @entity117 january , 2012 : defense secretary @entity118 took @entity55 version of warplane off probation august , 2011 : flight and ground operations suspended after electrical problems on @entity113 aircraft march , 2011 : @entity126 grounded after dual generator failure on @entity113 test aircraft january , 2011 : then defense secretary @entity129 placed probation on warplane threatening to cancel fighter jet unless costs and problems were sorted within two years ' the ability to operate at night is critical and so certainly the testing we 're doing here will provide a significant amount of data so we can clear the envelope and clear the aircraft to operate day and night , when the @entity55 takes the @entity114 to initial operating capability in 2015			1
' success in the latest round of tests is crucial in a weapons development programme which has been dogged with technical problems and demands on the @entity150 to slash costs			1
after a year of pressure to revise its estimate of maintaining a fleet of more than 2,000 f - 35s over 55 years , the agency finally caved in by slashing the number by more than 20 per cent , a move that could boost international support for the programme			2
the new estimate of $ 857billion could help ensure the new plane turns out to be as affordable as advertised			0
the @entity38 is the costliest weapons program in @entity11 history			0
the @entity150 estimates it will cost $ 392billion to develop and build 2,443 of the new jets for use by the @entity113 , @entity167 and @entity55			0
@entity16 is developing three models of the radar - evading warplane for the @entity11 and eight countries that are helping fund its development : @entity75 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 and the @entity180			2
the @entity16 is shown during an unveiling ceremony in @entity182 , @entity183			0

video shows the @entity186 in its latest set of sea trials aboard @entity21
' it all went extremely well , ' said test pilot lieutenant colonel @entity53 ' @entity191 ' @entity52
tests also included first take - off and landing at sea by @entity74 pilot
