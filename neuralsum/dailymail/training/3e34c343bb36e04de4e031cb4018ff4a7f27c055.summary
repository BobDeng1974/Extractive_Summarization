by @entity0 published : 17:03 est , 1 december 2012 updated : 17:03 est , 1 december 2012 responding well : @entity1 had her womb transplant in august last year a woman who had the world ’s first successful womb transplant is set to undergo @entity6 in a bid to fulfil her dream of motherhood			1
thousands of @entity11 women born without a womb will be given hope if the breakthrough treatment succeeds			1
speaking in @entity17 last week , her surgeon professor @entity15 revealed that the married housewife has responded so well to treatment that his medical team is confident the first ‘ donor womb ’ pregnancy is now possible			1
but some @entity11 experts , including @entity24 , claim that a pregnancy could cause potentially fatal complications			1
and the baby would have to be born by caesarean , which carries the risks of surgery			2
prof @entity15 , who performed the pioneering transplant on 22 - year - old @entity1 in august last year , announced her @entity6 treatment at a conference attended by the world ’s top transplant specialists			1
the event was organised by @entity37 , a consultant at @entity38 who could be ready to perform similar operations on @entity11 women in just two years			1
prof @entity15 , from @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity43 , also revealed three more women are to undergo transplants at his clinic , providing mrs @entity1 has a healthy baby			1
prof @entity15 said : ‘ this is the longest time any woman has gone without rejecting an implanted womb and we wanted to reach the year - and - a - half mark before going ahead			2
that will hopefully happen in three months ’ time as things are looking good so far			2
’ he described mrs @entity1 ’s health as ‘ absolutely normal ’ , adding : ‘ it ’s not only important for us to have this contact for the patient , it ’s also important for future cases			1
’ mrs @entity1 , who is married to 35 - year - old @entity61 , has said : ‘ if i had a magic wand , i would want to be pregnant now			1
i just want to hold my baby in my arms , to be a mother			2
’ prof @entity15 and his team will take two out of eight embryos frozen before mrs @entity1 ’s treatment , thaw them and transfer them into her uterus			1
the hope is this will lead to at least one baby – or even twins			0
there are at least 15,000 women in @entity11 alone who were born without a womb or who have had theirs removed as a result of cancer or other medical issues			1
tv presenter @entity81 revealed in 2009 that she had undergone a hysterectomy to stop her agonising periods			0
@entity84 already has two children			0
however , many women are childless when they have the drastic surgery			0
those in favour of womb transplants argue it is the only way to meet the desperate desire of many of these women to ‘ carry ’ their own baby			0
this need can not be met if they use another woman as a surrogate , a controversial process that is strictly regulated in the @entity11 and illegal in some countries , including @entity101 and @entity102			1
many @entity11 couples end up travelling to @entity104 , where clinics hire out women as surrogates			1
however , this is fraught with legal issues			0
for example , couples whose surrogate children are born abroad have to go to court in the @entity11 to ‘ prove ’ they are the legal parents			1
adoption does not give a woman the chance to have a child who is genetically her own and , again , there is a strict vetting procedure			0
artificial selection : mrs @entity1 had eight embryos frozen before her treatment			1
doctors will will thaw them and transfer them into her uterus danger : fertility expert @entity24 says the risks are not worth taking			1
surrogacy is an alternative option surgeon mr @entity37 has spent more than 15 years researching the possibility of pregnancy among women who have had womb transplants			1
in july , he revealed his team had achieved the first successful pregnancy in a rabbit with a transplanted uterus , although the animal went on to miscarry			1
he now plans to carry out the procedure on five more rabbits before it is trialled in sheep			0
only then will mr @entity37 approach @entity11 ethics committees for approval to try it on humans			1
women who have lost their wombs to cancer need to have been free of the disease for at least five years before they can be considered for a transplant			0
but womb transplants have been criticised by experts because they are not carried out to ‘ save a life ’			1
risks include rejection of the new womb and potential side effects during pregnancy from the powerful anti-rejection drugs			1
after the first womb transplant , carried out in @entity160 in 2000 , the donated organ ‘ failed ’ after three months because the blood vessels used to connect it were too narrow and became blocked by clots			0
however , prof @entity15 does not doubt womb transplants are worth the risks for thousands of women otherwise unable to have a ‘ normal ’ pregnancy			2
trials : @entity11 surgeon @entity37 could be ready to perform similar operations on @entity11 women in two years he said : ‘ many people think that womb transplants are n’t necessary because they ’re not lifesaving operations and that women have the option of adoption or surrogacy			1
‘ but we ’ve had applications from women all over the world wanting womb transplants			0
this is absolutely necessary for these women : you just have to ask them to realise this			0
’ a total of 100 women have now been screened by @entity187 in addition to @entity189 , who received her healthy organ from a car - crash victim			0
ten of these have been selected as possible recipients			0
of these , three have been approved for a transplant and have undergone fertility treatment			2
this has resulted in viable embryos , which have been put on ice			2
prof @entity15 could now have a race on his hands to become the first doctor to achieve a successful pregnancy from a womb transplant			2
@entity205 experts carried out two procedures in september , both involving the world ’s first mother - to - daughter uterus transplants			2
this week , they announced another two operations – a mother - to - daughter and an aunt - to - niece – with more transplants scheduled for early 2013			0
all involve live transplants , whereas prof @entity15 ’s @entity43 team used wombs from dead donors			0
the scientists and doctors at the @entity224 have received approval to complete ten procedures in total			2
the remaining six procedures , scheduled for next year , include a woman donating to her son ’s wife and another giving her womb to her younger sister			0
the next step is to begin embryo implantation at the end of 2013			0
professor @entity240 , who is leading the research team , told @entity242 that some of his patients have bonded over their shared dream of becoming mothers : ‘ the first couples had wanted to meet so three are now really good friends			0
when the first one had the transplant , she was straight on to the internet telling the others			0
’ all his patients are @entity205 , although at least one @entity11 woman has been assessed for treatment			1
@entity254 , who lives in @entity255 , had hoped to have her womb transplanted into her daughter @entity257 , 26 , who lives in @entity205			0
but she has been rejected on medical grounds			0
doctors are divided over whether to use living or dead donors			2
some experts are uncomfortable with taking the womb from a living woman when it is not for life - saving reasons			2
with live transplants , there are risks to two living patients			0
however , an organ from a living donor can be a better match .			0

doctors will implant two embryos frozen before @entity1 *'s* treatment
but @entity11 experts warn pregnancy could cause potentially fatal complications
