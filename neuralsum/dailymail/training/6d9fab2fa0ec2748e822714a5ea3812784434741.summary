the former @entity1 figure skater that lit the @entity4 flame during the @entity6 opening ceremony has deleted a racist photo of president and mrs @entity9 that she had previously posted			1
@entity10 is a triple @entity4 champion figure skater and is close with @entity1 president @entity11 so it came as little surprise that she was chosen to be one of the two athletes to have the key role in the opening ceremony			1
a scouring of her @entity19 account by @entity20 found that she had posted a photo of @entity22 and mrs @entity9 looking at someone who was holding up a banana , which has racist implications			1
starting a firestorm : @entity10 lit the @entity4 flame alongside @entity27 at the @entity6 ceremony friday doctored : she posted the image in september and took it down friday but did not apologize for it after being questioned about the photo , the 65 - year - old former politician said that there was nothing wrong with the image and refused to apologize for posting it			1
she said that she had been sent the photo from friends in @entity38 , and used their rights as a reason to justify her use of the photo			2
' freedom of speech is freedom of speech , and you should answer for your own hang - ups , ' she wrote according to @entity20			0
the @entity38 government did n't see it the same way , as the outgoing @entity38 ambassador to @entity1 posted to his own @entity19 account , saying that ms @entity10 's ' outrageous behaviour ... only brings shame to her parliament and country '			2
the tweet no longer appears on his account			0
neither of the @entity58 are attending the @entity1 games , which is largely understood to be a reflection of the frosty tensions between the two countries			0
taunting black people with bananas is a racist ploy that has been reported in other parts of @entity1 by visiting athletes through the years			0
this was just one of the controversies surrounding the opening ceremony that took place friday night in @entity1			0
the @entity6 games have been mired in debate over the country 's anti-homosexuality laws , yet two of the lead singers that were featured were the former girl pop group @entity80 who first shot to fame for pretending to be lesbian lovers and regularly kissing during performances			0
and one of the @entity4 rings failed to open on the display screen at the beginning of the show , which was seen as an embarrassment to organizers			2
central role : @entity10 is a 3 - time @entity93			1
