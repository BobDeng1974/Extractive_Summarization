thanks to beautiful celebrities such as @entity3 and @entity4 , who 've perfected the use of @entity6 and @entity7 to share new images of their enviable faces and bodies , we 're always on the hunt for new ways to perfect our own shots			2
but for many of us , it is n't a case of ' i woke up like this ' , as a recent study revealed that women spend a total of 753 hours taking , deleting , retaking and touching up their selfies to look picture perfect - and it seems we may not be alone			2
certain celebrities and their all - too - perfect social media snaps have come under fire , with fans accusing them of giving themselves a digital do - over			1
i am guilty of putting a filter on , which changes the lighting of the image , but i have never changed my body shape or retouched out any imperfections			2
' @entity40 downloaded @entity58 , an app that lets you retouch your skin , body shape , whiten your eyes and teeth , and had a play around on a few images of herself to see exactly what others are up to			1
' i actually think i look weird in the after shots , ' she said			2
' i think i look better before but that could be because i have n't got the hang of the app yet			0
' it is so sad that we are in a digital age where this is even possible as it makes us all insecure when we see these perfect women on @entity7 and @entity77			1
' @entity40 , pictured , left , naturally , and , right , after enhancing her snap , downloaded @entity58 , an app where you can retouch your skin , body shape , whiten your eyes and teeth @entity40 says that @entity4 is a prime example of this			1

the 33 - year - old posted some racy selfies to her @entity91 while wearing a leotard printed with the words ' 99 problems but my a * * ai n't one '			0
fans , however , called foul			0
according to @entity99 there was something fishy about how the curtains behind @entity4 's hips curve inward			0
@entity40 , who thinks she looks worse in the after shot , right , said it is ' so sad ' that we are in a digital age that makes us all insecure when we see seemingly perfect women on @entity7 and @entity77 @entity40 , pictured , left , before , and , right , after using the app , shows how skin can be smoothed using it a month earlier , in september , the @entity112 singer was accused of photoshopping a thigh gap into snaps of her on a yacht for her birthday celebrations			1
and in yet another instance she was accused of altering a photo of her playing golf in a bikini in april last year			1
@entity40 said : ' @entity4 changes her body curves a lot in images			1
it 's sad to see possibly one of the most powerful women in the world , who claims to be a feminist , bowing down to the pressures of trying to look perfect in every single picture			1
' @entity40 says that @entity4 changes her body curves a lot in images and says it 's sad to see possibly one of the most powerful women in the world doing it she continued : ' there is too much pressure on young girls growing up in today 's society with a fake impression of how they should look as they grow into a women			1
' the celebrities of our age who are on @entity6 and @entity7 are editing their images into better versions of themselves			2
this makes other women feel inferior and unattractive			0
this can lead to all sorts of problems for others including eating disorders , drastic plastic surgery and non-surgical enhancements			0
' now , @entity40 is pledging to hashtag all of her images with @entity160 - and she 's asking others with a big social media following , as well as celebrities , to do the same			1
' that way , ' she adds			0
' we are nâ€™t fooling our followers			0
on top of that it would be great to see all women embracing their looks and hash tagging their images with the same			0
' @entity3 often showcases her trim figure on her @entity6 page via a series of selfies but it has been pointed out by her followers that her waist appears smaller in her selfie ( left ) compared with pictures later taken by the paparazzi ( right )			0
