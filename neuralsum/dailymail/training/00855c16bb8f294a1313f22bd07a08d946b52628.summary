by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 was back home in @entity4 with a tee time booked but , had he been sitting in his usual coach ’s seat , he would have quietly purred his approval at @entity10 ’s return to @entity11			1
fifty weeks have passed since the grand old arena was last open for business but , in these vastly different circumstances , we got a similar level of sangfroid from the great home hope as he exhibited on that heady afternoon last july			0
@entity19 walked out looking like he had just come off the set of an x factor audition , but his boy - band appearance hid a significant threat on what can be a treacherous afternoon for a first - time defending champion			2
with a new mentor replacing @entity2 in the box , @entity10 turned in an excellent performance , his 6 - 1 , 6 - 4 , 7 - 5 victory suggesting he can again reach deep into this tournament			1
the nation has been in the grip of a sporting malaise , but thankfully @entity53 ’s no 1 tennis player seems immune and , with this potentially awkward occasion negotiated , it can be expected that he will still be around this time next week			1
@entity10 was rightfully pleased afterwards , although did not wish to discuss his place in the wider pattern of the country ’s fortunes , noting drily : ‘ i ’m yet to hear @entity60 discuss my matches at @entity62			1
’ he was , though , unusually bullish about his form , and clearly touched by the rousing standing ovation given to him upon emerging from those famous double doors : ‘ that reception was very nice to come out to			1
i enjoyed the walk to the chair and then when i sat down it was time to get down to business			2
‘ i played very well			0
i hit the ball clean from the beginning of the match			0
i thought the second and third sets were a very high level when he was playing aggressively			0
’ absent : @entity77 coach @entity2 was back home in @entity79 after parting ways with @entity10 defending champion : @entity10 is looking to win the @entity62 title for the second successive year breather : @entity10 wipes sweat off his forehead in between games history will record that the opening point of an occasion that has not been seen for 78 years — a @entity53 man defending the @entity62 singles title — resulted in the diminutive @entity92 firing the ball into the tramlines with his forehand			1
it very quickly became apparent that there were not going to be echoes of his fellow @entity99 from 2013 , @entity100 , who knocked out world no 1 @entity102 in such dramatic fashion			1
as on that day , the court looked totally different to the one which greeted @entity10 when he faced @entity107 in the final			1
the virgin surface was a thing of verdant beauty , which can bring challenges all of its own to those not used to it			0
@entity19 is a nimble mover , but it was notable how the much heavier @entity10 was so much more footsure			1
bar an early slip while serving in a third game , extracting an evil stare at the ground , the 27 - year - old @entity119 fairly glided around while the @entity92 took four tumbles on the slick new carpet			0
this contributed to him spraying his groundstrokes all over the place in the first set , and @entity10 was a grateful recipient as he was clearly under strain			1
you rarely hear him exhaling so noisily at the start of a match as he did yesterday , which told you this was no ordinary contest			0
overwhelmed : @entity19 was outclassed by @entity10 on @entity11 @entity10 's girls : @entity10 was watched by his girlfriend @entity136 ( left ) and new coach @entity137 ( right ) feel the love : @entity10 acknowledges the crowd as he heads for the changing rooms his ease of movement on the turf is just one indicator of how he has become such a reliable fixture at @entity62 , so supremely at ease that he has won 20 of his last 21 matches at @entity148 ( the exception being the 2012 loss to @entity151 )			1
most measures on his barometer indicated that his comfort level here has survived the twin blows in the passing 12 months of back surgery and the departure of @entity2			0
@entity10 is always dialled in mentally at the @entity159 in a way that he is not , for example , at @entity162 , where he is less sure of the fundamentals in his game			2
this was a good start for @entity137 but you could put @entity168 in prime position on his bench and still be almost guaranteed immaculate behaviour			0
if anyone looked unnerved by the occasion then initially it was @entity19 , the player with nothing to lose and who has previously shown that he can lift his game when faced with the sport ’s aristocracy at the @entity179			0
he only started to play to his full capabilities halfway through the second set , by which time the no 3 seed had secured his third break of the match			2
hello mum : @entity185 was in her customary seat to watch her soon charge through thereafter @entity19 provided an excellent test , which showed off just how versatile a player @entity10 is , and how his relatively flat groundstrokes and ability to keep the ball low work so well on grass			1
any match when your serve is not broken is a good one , and he may even have welcomed the challenge of needing to save two break points in the fourth game of the third set , when his opponent was playing at a level that made his world ranking of 104 look a nonsense			0
the @entity11 crowd , which only seems to bare any teeth when @entity107 plays @entity10 ( as happened in last year ’s final and the very different @entity208 semi-final ) almost encouraged @entity19 to come back into the match			2
yet from 40 - 0 up at 5 - 5 a shred of complacency seeped in and @entity10 pounced to seal the decisive break			2
all very encouraging , because that is just what champions do .			0

@entity10 returned to @entity62 for first time since winning the 2013 championships
@entity53 no 1 was given a standing ovation as he made his *entrance*
@entity10 made light work of and girlfriend @entity136 watched from the *sidelines*
