@entity2 , the chief constable of @entity3 , said society was becoming ‘ quite intolerant of young people ’ in public spaces			1
she said detectives had to decide whether annoying or noisy behaviour in a small group merited police action that could ‘ antagonise ’ teenagers			2
and she warned that new legislation against yobs could lead to childhood behaviour that was tolerated in previous generations being criminalised			2
under home secretary @entity26 ’s new antisocial behaviour bill children as young as ten can receive injunctions for ‘ causing nuisance ’ , and older children can be jailed for breaching such injunctions			1
the chief constable , who speaks for police chiefs on children and young people , said : ‘ what ’s antisocial to one person is just what i did and what many young people do			1
‘ we ’ve closed down a lot of places that people are allowed to go to			0
' we ’ve fenced off school grounds , i get it , but where do people collect ? when you ’re in a crowd of three or four it can get a bit noisy , is that antisocial ? ' when you ’re walking down a street and might be having a bit of a laugh and joke , is that antisocial ? ’ @entity2 was speaking to the @entity59 for children which is conducting an inquiry into the relationship between children and the police			1
she added : ‘ i ’m not saying that we will tolerate behaviour that is harassing , that is making people feel fearful , that is preventing other young people from going out because they do n’t want to walk down that street or through that park			0
‘ that is our job			0
we are here to protect everybody			0
but we need to be careful where the line is			0
' i think we are too ready as a society - as the police and particularly with some legislation coming up on the books - to label what looks like			1
growing up to me as antisocial behaviour			2
' ' we 've closed down a lot of places people are allowed to go to ' : ms @entity2 spoke to the @entity59 for children which is conducting an inquiry into the relationship between children and the police ( file photo ) the police recorded 2.3million incidents of anti-social behaviour in 2012 - 13 , down from 3.7million on a year earlier			1
however @entity97 has warned that there is wide variation in the way different forces treat offences , with some recording crimes wrongly as anti-social behaviour while others over-report minor incidents			0
campaigners have warned that the government 's @entity108 will criminalise more youngsters			2
the asbo introduced by @entity112 will be replaced , with a much lower test to prove anti-social bejhavour			0
offenders will only have to commit conduct ' capable of causing nuisance and annoyance ' rather than being likely to cause ' harassment , alarm or distress '			1
@entity122 , chief executive of the @entity123 , predicted that the antisocial behaviour bill would have perverse and harmful consequences			1
she said : ‘ we are concerned that children and teenagers will get into trouble with the law just for being annoying , and that it will penalise them from doing things that all children do as part of growing up – playing in the street , kicking a ball around in a public space or hanging around with their friends			0
‘ it threatens to further increase the divide between generations , alienate children and divert the police from fighting genuine crimes			0
’ @entity146 ministers say new ‘ streamlined and flexible ’ measures are needed to replace antisocial behaviour orders , more than half of which are breached at least once			2
other measures have proved ineffective or inadequate .			0

@entity3 chief @entity2 warns of intolerance towards youths
new laws mean 10 - year - olds could face injunctions for ' causing nuisance '
but ms @entity2 says what 's antisocial to one person is just a laugh to others
her *intervention* was welcomed by @entity123
