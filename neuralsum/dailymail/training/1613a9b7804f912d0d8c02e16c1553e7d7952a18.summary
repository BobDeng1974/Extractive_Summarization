fashion label @entity0 has been slammed by industry insiders for featuring photographer @entity3 in its latest campaign , despite the series of shocking allegations of sexual assault that have been made against him by more than a dozen models			1
it is the fourth time that the 49 - year - old has appeared in a @entity0 ad , having helped to showcase the brand 's accessories collections for the past three seasons			1
and while his face is not featured in the campaigns - just his arms and legs , which are easily identified by his distinctive tattoos - many critics have been left horrified that the brand has continued to show its support for @entity3 and his work			1
' personally , as part of the younger crowd they ’re trying to tap into , i prefer rape vibes as a removable feature rather than inextricably connected to the product			0
' @entity45 's @entity44 added : ' while [ @entity48 ] @entity47 's nearly 50 plus year career and clean cut image has been destroyed in under 2 weeks , [ @entity3 ] has continued to work within his industry , despite the public confession of several models who to have been taken advantage of			1
' this marks [ @entity0 's ] third time collaborating [ with him ] and although the photos are aesthetically pleasing , we ca n’t help but wonder if the truth behind the @entity3 claims will ever come out			2
' according to @entity62 , the first allegations made against @entity3 came to light in 2005 , when he faced two lawsuits from models accusing him of sexual assault			2
he settled both cases out of court			0
since then , dozens of models have come forward to accuse the photographer of abusing his role and taking advantage of young women and men while working with them			0
in october last year , a young woman from @entity76 started an online campaign calling for brands to cut ties with the photographer once and for all			0
' more awareness needs to be brought to light that @entity3 is negatively influencing media with his supposed exploit & abuse of certain models , mainstream degrading pornographic imagery , and inappropriate and unprofessional behavior , ' londoner @entity84 wrote on her petition			2
considerate and respectful ? the 49 - year - old has continued to deny all allegations made against him ' why if we are aware of these allegations are big companies still using @entity3 as a photographer and still giving him positive press if he is an alleged sex offender ? ' these allegations need to be looked at more closely and the appropriate justice received			1
they should not be ignored			0
by continuing to employ him for editorial fashion shoots , or to run advertising campaigns shot by him is to condone his behavior			0
' and while @entity0 has continued to show support for the photographer , both @entity108 and @entity109 have publicly distanced themselves from @entity3 , with a @entity108 spokesperson confirming in april that the magazine has no plans to work with him again			1
in a statement made to @entity117 , the publication said : ' the last assignment @entity3 had for @entity119 @entity108 appeared in the july 2010 issue and we have no plans to work with him in the future			1
' @entity3 has continued to deny the allegations made against him , writing on his blog : ' i just want to take a moment to say i ’m really hurt by the recent and false allegations of insensitivity and misconduct			0
' i 've always been considerate and respectful of the people i photograph and i view what i do as a real collaboration between myself and the people in front of the camera			0

it is the fourth time that the 49 - year - old has featured in the brand 's campaigns - despite *numerous* calls for him to be *dropped*
