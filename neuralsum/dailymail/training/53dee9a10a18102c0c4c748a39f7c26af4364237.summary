by @entity0 the many roles that teachers are expected to fill beyond the bounds of educator seem to be increasing every year			0
now there is greater pressure than ever for them to take on the role of a doctor too , as the number of children who need regular medication during school hours continues to rise			2
however the perils of this were proven earlier in the week when a young boy was given another student 's medication by accident , the @entity21 report			1
teachers are now taking on more responsibility than ever and at many schools are administering their students ' medication a six - year - old boy called @entity28 who needed ritalin - which is used to treat attention deficit disorder - was apparently given another child 's medication by accident			1
the child 's teacher apparently figured out what had happened very quickly , but he had already swallowed the wrong tablet			0
@entity28 's dad @entity37 told the publication he understands that accidents occur but he was not happy with the way the his son 's school - @entity41 in @entity44 's west - handled the situation			2
this week a young boy was given the wrong medication at school when it was mixed up with another child 's ' as humans we can make mistakes , but it was the way it was handled ' , mr @entity37 said			1
the teachers apparently did not keep an eye on the boy to check for any potential side effects			2
however @entity60 @entity59 branch president @entity58 pointed out that the demands on teachers are increasing and the responsibility they have is much greater than a decade ago			0
ms @entity58 also said as some children need various doses of some medications at various times throughout the day - this can be very difficult to keep track of			0
some students require medication more than once a day and this places pressure on teachers the issue is a complex one and in some cases teachers are taking on the role of doctors , when they are not necessarily trained to do so			1
the increase in children taking medication is said to be due to a rise in the number of kids with either allergies or behavioral issues which require medication as part of their treatment			1
@entity41 's principal said the mix - up occurred because one of the medication was n't labelled properly and therefore got combined with another student 's			0
the school is now apparently looking at a new system which could see children 's pictures attached to their medication to avoid any further issues .			0

a young @entity44 boy was given the wrong medication this week
teachers mixed up the medicine due to incorrect labelling
*highlights* the fact teachers are taking on greater responsibilities
however most are not trained medically to administer certain medications
