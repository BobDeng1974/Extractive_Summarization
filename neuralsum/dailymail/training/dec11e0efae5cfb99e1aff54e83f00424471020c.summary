by @entity0 last updated at 4:07 pm on 15th december 2011 the entry - level phone is the first @entity2 from @entity3 in the @entity4 and is targeted at the 150 million @entity4 who have yet to make the transition to smartphones it 's a pairing of two also - rans - @entity3 , the @entity8 phone company whose phones have lost market share to rivals such as @entity13 and @entity14 , and @entity15 , the no. 4 @entity4 mobile service			1
but @entity3 's ' starter ' smartphone , @entity17 , might have the secret sauce required for succces - it 's just $ 50			1
it 's aimed at the 150 million @entity4 who have yet to use touchscreen ' smartphones ' such as @entity24			1
@entity3 's ' comeback ' phone - running @entity26 's colourful , simple @entity2 software - will launch in the @entity4 on january 11 , exclusive to @entity15			1
it has a 3.7 - inch colour touchscreen and five - megapixel camera - which puts it behind technology leaders such as @entity32 and @entity34 's @entity33			0
but it offers internet , email and downloadable apps , just like its rivals - and also @entity39			0
the phone will miss the crucial holiday sales season , though			0
it 's the first @entity3 smartphone running @entity43 in the @entity4 @entity44 has also failed to make a dent in the market so far - analysts @entity47 said that the software only accounted for 1.6 per cent of the market worldwide earlier this year			1
it 's a make - or - break launch for both @entity3 and @entity26 - and aimed squarely at first - time smartphone buyers			2
@entity3 's @entity17 will be available on @entity15 's @entity52 on january 11 next year - priced at just $ 50 , and aimed at the 150 million @entity4 who do n't use smartphones such as @entity24 the $ 49.99 price could be crucial in luring some of the 150 million @entity4 consumers who still use more basic phones			1
but @entity3 needs to convince bigger national operators to carry its handsets if it wants to be back in the game			0
@entity3 ’s share of the @entity4 smartphone market will be around 1 percent in 2011 , according to @entity63 analyst @entity62			0

@entity17 will offer hi - tech features such as apps , mapping , email and internet at a much lower price than rivals such as @entity13 's @entity32 @entity75 , the head of @entity3 ’s @entity4 business , said the company would push hard to give operators a reason to carry @entity3 devices			2
since @entity82 is the smallest of the national @entity4 operators , @entity3 investors will be anxious to hear when it expects to sell the smartphones with the bigger carriers like @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			0
