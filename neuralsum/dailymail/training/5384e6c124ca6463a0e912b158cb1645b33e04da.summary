by @entity0 published : 08:34 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 09:28 est , 7 march 2014 the terrifying risk of sinkholes opening up without warning has increased in large parts of the world			0
in the @entity8 , a sinkhole recently swallowed eight rare cars at a @entity11 sports museum and in the @entity13 , scientists have warned that more sinkholes are expected to swallow up @entity13 - and perhaps unsuspecting @entity13 - following the recent flooding			2
now @entity16 has revealed that its radar data , routinely collected by satellites , may be able to predict these strange geological formations months before they appear			1
aerial photo of a sinkhole that formed unexpectedly near @entity22			1
new analysis of @entity16 airborne radar data collected in 2012 reveals the radar detected indications of the sinkhole before it collapsed and forced evacuations the space agency claims that signs of a sinkhole that is now 25 acres large ( 10.1 hectares ) and growing were caught by its radar before it opened			1
the technique , while not able to detect all sinkholes , could help spot them in areas where sinkholes are likely to form			1
sinkholes are depressions in the ground formed when the @entity42 ’s surface layers collapse into caverns below			1
they usually form without warning			0
@entity16 made its discovery after analysing data from a special kind of radar aboard a jet flying over the @entity52 coast in 2011 and 2012			1
the team used an @entity54 ( @entity54 ) to measure subtle lumps and holes in @entity42 's surface			2
their study showed the surface layer deformed at least a month before the collapse , moving mostly horizontally up to 10.2 inches ( 260 mm ) toward where the sinkhole would later form typically , sinkholes have no natural external surface drainage , and they form through natural processes and human activities			1
they are usually the result of what are known as @entity71 processes			0
they occur when a layer of rock underneath the ground is dissolved by acidic water			0
in many cases rainfall get through the soil , absorbing carbon dioxide and reacting with decaying @entity80 causes the water to become acidic			0
the acidic water causes the erosion of the soluble rock layers beneath the surface - eventually creating a sinkhole			0
the deepest is @entity86 's @entity85 at 2172ft ( 662m )			0
the @entity87 in @entity88 is roughly 50 miles ( 80km ) by 75 miles ( 121km ) in surface size			0
the radar detected a huge sinkhole before it collapsed near @entity22			1
researchers @entity92 and @entity93 analysed something known as interferometric synthetic aperture radar ( @entity97 ) imagery			0
this imagery uses an @entity54 ( @entity98 ) to measure subtle lumps and holes in @entity42 's surface			2
their study showed the surface layer deformed at least a month before the collapse , moving mostly horizontally up to 10.2 inches ( 260 mm ) toward where the sinkhole would later form			1
these initial surface movements covered a much larger area - about 1,640 by 1,640 feet , ( 500 by 500 metres ) - than that of the sinkhole , which measured about 2 acres ( 1 hectare )			0
‘ while horizontal surface deformations had not previously been considered a signature of sinkholes , the new study shows they can precede sinkhole formation well in advance , ’ said ms @entity92			2
a 50ft - deep hole appeared in the central reservation on a section of the @entity122 in north @entity123 earlier this year @entity16 made the discovery after looking at data from a jet flown over @entity52 ‘ this kind of movement may be more common than previously thought , particularly in areas with loose soil near the surface			1
’ the @entity22 sinkhole formed unexpectedly in 2012 after weeks of minor earthquakes and bubbling natural gas that provoked community concern			1
it was caused by the collapse of a sidewall of an underground storage cavity connected to a nearby well operated by @entity140 and owned by @entity141			0
the sinkhole , which filled with slurry - a fluid mixture of water and pulverised solids - has gradually expanded and now measures about 25 acres ( 10.1 hectares ) and is at least 750 feet ( 229 metres ) deep			0
a sinkhole opened up on february 12 beneath the @entity148 in @entity11 devouring 8 corvettes typically , sinkholes have no natural external surface drainage , and they form through natural processes and human activities			1
they occur in regions of terrain where the rock below the surface can be dissolved by groundwater , most commonly in areas with limestone or other carbonate rocks , gypsum or salt beds			0
@entity16 said continued radar monitoring of the area as recently as october 2013 has shown a widening area of lower ground , with the potential to affect other nearby storage cavities , continued growth of the sinkhole threatens the community and @entity174 , so there is a pressing need for reliable estimates of how fast it may expand and how big it may eventually get			1
‘ this kind of data could be of great value in determining the direction in which the sinkhole is likely to expand , ’ said ms @entity92			2
‘ at @entity22 , it appears that material is continuing to flow into the huge cavern that is undergoing collapse			1
’ mr @entity93 says there are no immediate plans to fly radar over sinkhole - prone areas			2
‘ you could spend a lot of time flying and processing data without capturing a sinkhole , ’ he said			0
‘ our discovery at @entity22 was really serendipitous			2
but it does demonstrate one of the expected benefits of an @entity97 satellite that would image wide areas frequently			0

@entity16 made discovery after looking at data from a jet flown over @entity52
the radar detected a huge sinkhole before it collapsed near @entity22
@entity42 moved horizontally 10.2 inches ( 260 mm ) a month before the event
@entity16 said the technique , while not able to detect all sinkholes , could help spot them in areas where sinkholes are likely to form
