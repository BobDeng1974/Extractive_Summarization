by @entity0 , political correspondent @entity1 has admitted he looks less like a prime minister than @entity3 – and highlighted his resemblance to @entity5 of @entity5 and @entity5 fame			1
declaring that ‘ there ’s more to politics than the photo op ’ , the @entity8 leader attempted to portray himself as a politician of substance , compared with mr @entity3 ’s political ‘ posturing ’ and focus on appearance			1
but within minutes of finishing his speech yesterday , it emerged @entity8 is to hire an £ 80,000 - a - year spin doctor to improve the way mr @entity1 looks on television			2
photo flop : @entity1 ( left ) admitted to his rather unfortunate likeness to @entity5 ( right ) of @entity5 in @entity5 and critics pointed out that he left the country this week – missing a debate on the @entity28 plane crash in the process – for a photo opportunity with @entity32 president @entity31			1
social media sites lit up with cringeworthy pictures of mr @entity1 posing for ‘ selfies ’ with celebrities including @entity38 star @entity37 , singer @entity39 and artist @entity40			2
the speech marked the start of a six - week campaign by senior @entity8 figures designed to reverse the party ’s slide in the polls and shape mr @entity1 as a potential future prime minister			1
as he attempted to change the terms of political debate around his appearance , mr @entity1 admitted that if he fought the campaign as a ‘ photo op contest ’ he would not win the @entity53			1
food for thought : that bacon sandwich photograph ( left ) ( and @entity5 , right , fares no better in his attempt ) labour leader @entity1 has struggled to shake off criticism of his public image , most notably after he appeared to struggle to eat a bacon sandwich during a photo opportunity at @entity63 he conceded he was neither ‘ square - jawed ’ nor ‘ chiselled ’ and did not look like a politician out of ‘ central casting ’			1
mr @entity1 added : ‘ i am not trying to win a photo op contest in the next ten months			2
and i would n’t win it if i tried			0
’ @entity3 repeatedly mistook @entity68 for @entity69 yesterday – during an interview with @entity71			2
the prime minister listed what he thought were the government ’s economic achievements in the area , but repeatedly referred to @entity69			1
the presenter @entity77 snapped : ‘ you keep mentioning the @entity79			0
that ’s not our region , prime minister			1
i ’m sorry , we are the @entity84			0
’ the @entity79 runs through @entity85 , while the @entity84 lies 30 miles to the south			0
mr @entity3 , who was conducting one of half a dozen back - to - back local radio interviews from @entity89 , replied : ‘ i ’m sorry , i thought i was doing … ’ @entity90 , @entity8 mp for @entity91 and @entity92 , said it showed mr @entity3 was ‘ out of touch ’			2
and , extraordinarily , he said the changes he wanted to make to the country would take more than two terms of @entity75 – an apparent pitch for three consecutive @entity8 terms			0
in his speech to @entity8 supporters in central @entity89 , mr @entity1 attempted to present himself as serious and principled compared to mr @entity3 ’s ‘ superficial ’ and image - driven approach			1
the photo opportunity , he said , is ‘ not where my talents lie – as you may have noticed ’			0
he said : ‘ i am not from central casting			0
you can find people who are more square - jawed , more chiselled , look less like @entity5			2
‘ you could probably even find people who look better eating a bacon sandwich			0
if you want the politician from central casting , it ’s just not me , it ’s the other guy			0
‘ and if you want a politician who thinks that a good photo is the most important thing , then do n’t vote for me			0
but here ’s the thing : i believe that people would quite like somebody to stand up and say there is more to politics than the photo op. and that culture diminishes our politics			0
’ he said mr @entity3 was ‘ a very sophisticated and successful exponent of a politics driven by image ’ , who had posed with huskies before the election to highlight climate change – but went on to turn his back on green issues			1
this week mr @entity1 flew to @entity137 for a ' brush by ' meeting and photo opportunity with @entity31 in april this year mr @entity1 managed to squeeze into a celebrity selfie with @entity38 star @entity37 , artist @entity40 , actress @entity143 and author @entity144 mr @entity3 said mr @entity1 ’s speech proved he was the leader who lacked substance			1
‘ on a day when our national output has recovered to where it was before the great recession , which was brought to us by @entity8 , i think it was an extraordinary thing to say , ‘ said the prime minister			1
@entity154 chairman @entity153 said : ‘ if he wants to be taken seriously he should be talking about the economy and how we can secure a better future for our children and grandchildren			0
not why he struggles to eat a bacon sandwich			0
’ during last year 's @entity8 conference , mr @entity1 posed with his @entity162 and sons @entity164 ( centre ) and @entity166 ( @entity167 ) for a walk along @entity170 beach			2

@entity1 admitted he looks less like a prime minister than @entity3
also highlighted his resemblance to @entity5 of @entity5 and *gromit* fame
he *insisted* image is not everything , and wants to focus on bigger issues
