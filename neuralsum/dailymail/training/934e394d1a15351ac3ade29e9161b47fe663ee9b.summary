by @entity0 it may look like an modern art installation in a gallery , but this shell - shaped clock is designed to make telling the time easier			1
according to two designers , @entity6 read in a straight line and often calculate mathematical equations in a long string too , so can find it unnatural to navigate a circular clock face			1
to solve the problem , the @entity14 - based artists created the @entity16 , which features a revolving ‘ shell ’ indicating the passing hours			1
time for a change ? two designers in @entity14 , the @entity21 , have created the @entity16 , which features a revolving ‘ shell ’ that indicates the passing hours while the shell slowly rotates around a central point like the hands of a clock , it points out the hours on a linear plate , so people only have to glance at the arty timepiece to tell the time			1
of course digital displays already offer people a quick way to tell the time , but most are not so aesthetically pleasing			0
sadly there is no way to mark the passing of seconds on the shell clock but the object is a thought - provoking art project , rather than a commercial offering , @entity38 reported			2
designers @entity47 and @entity49 , of studio @entity46 said : ‘ this unique time display offers a playful alternative to one of the most known objects to men and may draw some more attention and increase awareness to our advance through time			1
’ playing it straight : while the shell ( pictured left and right ) slowly rotates around a central point like the hands of a clock , it points out the hours on a linear plate , so people only have to glance at the arty timepiece many designers have put their own spin on the clock – from a menagerie of smartwatches offering functions as well as telling the time , to giant installations that track the lunar cycle			1
the world 's first moon clock is being planned , that will use tidal power to display the moon 's phase on its ' face '			2
it is intended to sit at the historic centre of time at @entity86 , @entity87 and would be made of three concentric glass rings with leds beneath the surface , producing light powered by tidal turbines if it is built			0
sadly there is no way to mark the passing of seconds yet on the shell clock ‘ face ’ ( pictured left and right ) but the object is a thought - provoking art project , rather than a commercial offering @entity86 moontime : many designers have put their own spin on the clock			1
the world 's first moon clock ( illustrated ) is being planned , which will use tidal power to display the moon 's phase on its ' face ' meanwhile , a robot clock has been designed in @entity110 that writes the time using a dry wipe pen on a miniature white board			2
its mechanical arms then erase the time from this board , before starting again - and each time the robot writes , the numbers correspond to the real - world time as its being written			0
designers in @entity124 have recently launched a watch that replaces hands with ball bearings so that it can be used by visually impaired people – as well as those who want to tell the time subtly			0
the ball in the central groove of the @entity132 timepiece rotates to mark the minutes , while another set into its side travels round the face to denote the hours			0
it costs around $ 275 ( £ 164 )			0
the @entity137 , pictured , was designed by @entity139 member @entity138 , also known as @entity140 from @entity141			0
it writes the time , in hours and minutes , on a white board using a dry wipe pen , before erasing it and starting again touch the time : as well as helping visually impaired people live independently the @entity132 timepiece has been a hit with people with perfect sight too			0

two designers in @entity14 created the @entity16
it features a revolving ‘ shell ’ that indicates the hour on a linear plate
there is no way of marking seconds on the clock , which is a ' playful alternative ' to a *standard* circular face
