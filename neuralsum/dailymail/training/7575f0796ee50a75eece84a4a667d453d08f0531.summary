he 's the self - made millionaire who has succeeded at everything he 's taken on - from court cases against foreign governments to mastering emerging technologies and playing the stock market			1
he was @entity6 's richest politician long before @entity7 arrived on the scene			0
now , the ultimate prize may be in sight for @entity11			2
while @entity14 mps today defeated a spill motion that would have brought on a challenge to prime prime minister @entity17 , the leadership crisis is almost certain to continue			1
and while it does , mr @entity11 will stay the man most likely to take over as leader , and prime minister			2
observers interpreted the result as meaning mr @entity17 's leadership is still in dire trouble			1
while mr @entity11 has remained publicly silent on the issue , mps have reportedly said he was ready to challenge mr @entity17 for the leadership if it came to a vote			1
he is almost universally considered to be the only realistic challenger to mr @entity17 , who defeated him in a leadership ballot six years ago - by one vote			1
mr @entity17 went on to win the 2013 election and become prime minister			2
while mutinous @entity14 mps see mr @entity17 as having lost touch , a belief fuelled by the @entity56 prince @entity55 knighting incident , mr @entity11 regularly scores well in opinion polls and is considered a colourful and cunning character with his head in the game			1
his love for technology and his constant online presence stands in contrast with the prime minister 's recent comparison of @entity68 to ' electronic graffiti ' which he said was ' a big mistake to pay too much attention to '			0
the communications minister displays his phone during @entity74 question time at @entity75 , @entity76 , in 2014 mr @entity11 is an avid user of the medium , and has 327,000 @entity68 followers compared to the prime minister 's 440,000 as reports circulated that he was holding a secret meeting with potential leadership plotter @entity82 last week , mr @entity11 responded by tweeting a photograph of him smiling as he sat , alone , on a train miles from where the supposed meeting took place the then former environment minister pictured with a journalist at his house in @entity91 in 2007 mr @entity11 is an avid user of the medium , and has 327,000 @entity68 followers compared to the prime minister 's 440,000			1
in one example of mr @entity11 using social media to his advantage , as reports circulated that he was holding a secret meeting with potential leadership plotter @entity82 , he responded by tweeting a photograph of him smiling as he sat , alone , on a train miles from where the supposed meeting took place			2
' @ @entity103 you need to improve yr [ sic ] surveillance ! i am on the train to @entity108			0
@entity110 2nite , ' the caption read			0
the technology obsession stems from way back for @entity11 , who co-founded @entity112 - which at one point was one of the largest internet service providers in the country - back in 1994			1
it was an investment that reportedly made him $ 60 million when he finally sold it in 1999 , @entity117 reported			2
but the former investment banker 's fortune was evident long before the sale , when he purchased his first million dollar property in @entity91 's exclusive suburb of @entity124 , also in 1994			0
a second purchase next door , for over $ 7 million just a few years later , allowed him to expand his exclusive section of the waterside even further , according to @entity117			0
mr @entity11 and his wife then sold that property in 2011 for $ 13.6 million			2
his current harbour - side @entity124 estate is close to the @entity134 mansion which sold for about $ 52 million , @entity117 recently reported			0
despite his great wealth - he was valued at $ 186million on @entity137 's rich list in 2010 , @entity117 reported - mr @entity11 is keen to dispel the ' silvertail ' tag and portray himself as a self - made man who rose to the top from next to nothing			1

' on a number of public occasions , he has also recalled his turbulent childhood , in which his parents divorced and his mother took off with most of the family 's belongings			1
' i know what it 's like to be very short of money			0
i know what it 's like to live in rented flats , i know what it is like to grow up with a single parent , ' he said back in 2008 when he was chosen to lead the @entity188 , according to the @entity6			0
raised by his father and reliant on scholarships for his education at @entity192 , and as a @entity194 at @entity195 - an honour he shares with mr @entity17 - there are now predictions that if he become prime minister , mr @entity11 would revisit the @entity200 education reforms			1
a father - of - two himself , @entity11 is well known as a family man , and a romantic one at that			1
he has been married to @entity205 - the daughter of one of @entity6 's leading barristers and former conservative attorney general @entity208 - for more than 30 years			2
@entity11 ( left ) with then local mp @entity209 ( right ) at a morning tea in @entity211 , @entity212 's east , in 2009 @entity11 with his wife @entity205 , whom he met at the age of 23 the family man with ( from left ) his wife @entity146 , daughter @entity148 , son @entity149 at the @entity6 premiere of the film ' @entity221 ' at the @entity222 in 2003 mr @entity11 recalled how the pair met , in an @entity225 article last year			2
' she was 19 and i was 23			0
our first encounter was not across a crowded room , or on a dance floor , but in the otherwise thoroughly unromantic environment of her father 's legal chambers where she was working over the summer holidays , ' he wrote			0
' i was so in love and so worried i would lose her that i asked her to marry me soon after we met			0
she said we should wait until we grew up			0
thankfully , we did n't ( it is not entirely clear that men ever grow up , of course ) and we were married two years later , in 1980			0
' over the years , we have grown together			0
it is almost impossible to imagine , let alone remember , what it was like not to be together , so much so that i have a much clearer sense of ' @entity146 and me ' than i do of ' me '			0
' @entity205 is no shrinking violet herself , becoming @entity91 's first woman lord mayor in 2003			0
mr @entity11 's views on climate change , his leadership of the campaign for @entity6 to dump the @entity254 monarchy and become a republican at the 1999 referendum , and his liberal views on gay rights and other issues have stamped him as an iconoclastic conservative			1
the former investment banker back in 2004 as the @entity14 candidate for the seat of @entity266			2
he is pictured at @entity267 during vote counting mr @entity11 speaks to the prime ministers ' chief of staff @entity270 during question time in the @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 as an investment banker in the 1980s , mr @entity11 's partners included former @entity276 premier @entity275 , a @entity278 stalwart , and former @entity278 prime minister @entity155 's son @entity279			1
mr @entity11 has said he was approached by @entity278 to join that side of politics , and that he politely turned them down			2
it was as a lawyer that mr @entity11 first came to public notice , as a brash and confident young barrister who took on the @entity254 government in the 1986 @entity290 trial			1
fighting for former @entity254 spy @entity153 , whose book was accused of revealing top secret information , @entity11 's victory meant the book and its excerpts were allowed to be published			1
he later famously defended @entity296 against drug trafficking and tax evasion accusations			0
in some ways , mr @entity11 's past is not unlike mr @entity17 's - both of them studied at the @entity303 and @entity195 and both of them went on to work as journalists			1
in policy however , they are worlds apart : @entity11 for one , once supported an emissions trading scheme , has clarified his stance as a firm believer of climate change and has voiced his support for gay marriage quite openly			1
when mr @entity17 won their first leadership contest in 2009 , a devastated mr @entity11 initially indicated he would quit politics , before changing his mind and accepting the role of opposition communications spokesman , and later minister			1
on monday , @entity6 will watch if he is forced to bite back the promise he once uttered during an interview with @entity160 : ' i resolved , when i decided to stay in parliament , that i would do everything i could to give @entity326 a loyalty and a consistency that not all my colleagues gave me			0
' i 've done that			0
if @entity326 is unsuccessful — and i do n't think he will be — no one will be able to say @entity11 was anything other than supportive			0

*failure* of today 's spill motion unlikely to end @entity14 leadership crisis
@entity11 will stay the most likely contender to *replace* @entity17 as pm
@entity11 's colourful past and charm have made him *popular* with voters
@entity11 was a high - *profile* lawyer and *merchant* banker before politics
he co-founded internet service provider @entity112
was valued at $ 186million on @entity137 's rich list in 2010
had a turbulent childhood , raised by his father and reliant on scholarships
views on climate change , the @entity254 monarchy and gay rights make him an iconoclastic conservative
