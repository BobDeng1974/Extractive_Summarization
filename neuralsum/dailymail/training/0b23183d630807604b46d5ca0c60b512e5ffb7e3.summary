they included causing suffering to a pony which had to be put to sleep after a horrifically - bodged castration			2
he was originally given a six - month suspended prison sentence by @entity61 magistrates but he was later jailed for breaching the terms of the order			0
@entity9 had a sweatshirt with his name on it , business cards and he employed a woman who was supposedly a veterinary nurse - but he did not have any premises of his own			1
mr @entity50 said : ‘ in reality , he was not registered to practise as a vet			0
‘ he had no qualifications but he told her he wanted to expand into the field of domestic animals			0
’ in september 2012 , @entity9 became friendly with @entity76 , who at the time had been running a small cat rescue scheme , called under @entity79 , since 2008			2
one cat , called @entity81 , was injected on several occasions by @entity9 after being examined			0
@entity81 was put to sleep by him in november 2012 after he claimed she was suffering from a stomach tumour			0
in december that year , @entity9 offered to treat a @entity86 terrier , owned by @entity87 , but told him the dog had liver failure and should be put to sleep			0
mr @entity87 agreed and because he believed that @entity9 had done him and the dog a good service , paid him £ 20 instead of the £ 10 fee requested			0
mr @entity87 later became aware of bad @entity96 comments about @entity9 and contacted the @entity97 , which had never heard of the supposed vet			2
@entity9 cruelly inflicted excruciating pain on animals by carrying out botched operations and several had to be put down afterwards because it made them so ill. two of the cats he unnecessarily injected later died ( above ) he is believed to have contacted @entity105 because of a @entity96 campaign she started about the fraudster and he was caught after an investigation by the @entity109			1

but , the injection of one of the cats belonging to @entity123 went wrong and the needle snapped or bent , causing blood to spray out			1
the cat became very distressed and was ‘ literally coughing up its guts ’			0
miss @entity117 believed the cat ‘ must have suffered horribly ’ before it died and said the sight would stay with her always			0
she claimed @entity9 later ‘ seemed to delight in what he was doing ’ in showing her the cat ’s innards			1
@entity9 later gave a booster injection to one of mrs @entity113 ’s cats and he also told her to give it a full syringe of syrup of figs. its condition did not improve and a proper vet told her the cat was suffering from organ failure			2
