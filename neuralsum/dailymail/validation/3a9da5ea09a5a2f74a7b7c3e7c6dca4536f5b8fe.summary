more than 200,000 @entity1 second home owners are celebrating a decisive victory over @entity4 tax laws			1
the @entity6 has ruled that president @entity8 's eye - watering charge targeting second homes violated @entity11 law , the @entity5 reported			1
as a result , @entity1 who have rented out or sold second homes in @entity4 over the past three years can look forward to receiving tens of millions of euros in reimbursement from the @entity4 government			2
@entity17 : @entity1 citizens who own second homes in @entity4 , like this attractive stone manoir in @entity21 , southern @entity4 , left , will no longer have to pay the large ' social contribution ' charge levied by @entity4 president @entity8 , right , and can apply to the @entity4 government for a payout in 2012 , @entity8 's @entity26 government introduced painful new charges on second home owners , which hit hundreds of thousands of @entity1			1
tax on rental income from second homes was raised from 20 per cent to 35.5 per cent , while capital gains tax was increased from 19 to 34.5 per cent			1
a mandatory , 15.5 per cent ' social contribution ' was introduced on both capital gains and rental income , raising an additional € 250 million a year for the @entity4 welfare system			1
this , the @entity4 finance ministry said , would ' remove an unjustified tax advantage ' for ex-patriot owners			0
the measures caused uproar among @entity1 owners of @entity4 property			2
it meant they were paying towards a social security system from which they would not benefit , on top of paying towards the welfare state in @entity1			2
moreover , since the charge was categorised as a ' contribution ' rather than a tax , it did not qualify for @entity1 's double - taxation treaty with @entity4 , meaning that @entity1 second home owners were effectively being taxed twice			1
according to calculations by the @entity5 , this meant that a @entity1 couple who bought a @entity4 home for € 200,000 20 years ago and sold it for € 750,000 would be forced to pay a painful € 60,000 ' social contribution ' on top of standard capital gains tax , which would not be acknowledged by the @entity1 tax system			1
but now the @entity6 in @entity63 , the @entity65 's highest court , ruled that the ' social contribution ' charge violated @entity65 law because it is illegal for @entity65 citizens to contribute towards the social security systems of two member states at once			1
' a person exercising an activity in one @entity74 is only subject to social security regulation of that @entity74 ' , said @entity76 , the @entity65 's top legal advisor			2
experts in @entity4 tax law are advising anybody who may be affected by the ruling to submit a claim to the @entity4 tax authorities as soon as possible , also demanding a refund of fees charged by tax agents			0
@entity1 couples duped into buying illegal @entity89 homes finally have a reason to celebrate after a decade of campaigning led to a change in the law			0
during the property boom , @entity1 who dreamed of spending their retirement in sunny @entity89 forked out their life savings to buy new homes - only to find they had been built illegally and could be demolished and were not guaranteed compensation			0
but thanks to years of campaigning by heart - broken @entity89 homeowners , the law now states homes will not be demolished until they receive a payout			0
at the beginning of the last decade , new homes were built in abundance in @entity89 and buyers from northern @entity11 were keen to snap them up			0
but thousands had been built without planning permission and property promoters were ordered by the court to demolish the homes at their own expense , despite having already sold them			0
although the court would acknowledge the existence of a buyer , there was no guarantee they would receive compensation			0
on tuesday , the @entity120 made an amendment to the law meaning those who bought their properties in good faith must be compensated before demolition			2
this is , in part , thanks to determined @entity1 expats who have campaigned for change for many years .			0

in 2012 , @entity8 's @entity26 government introduced painful new charges on @entity1 second home owners
a mandatory , 15.5 per cent ' social contribution ' was introduced on both capital gains and rental income
this meant that @entity1 were paying into two social security systems , and effectively being taxed twice
the @entity6 has ruled that this violated @entity65 law , meaning that thousands of @entity1 are in line for *substantial* payouts
