by @entity0 and @entity1 for @entity2 scorching lava from one of the world 's most active volcanos on saturday continued to creep slowly but steadily through cracks in the earth toward a rural community on @entity11 's @entity10			1
scientists warn that if the lava flow from @entity15 continues on its path , it could reach a small patch of residential homes in about a week			1
@entity15 , the youngest volcano on @entity10 , has been continuously erupting since 1983			1
the @entity20 estimates @entity15 's first eruption happened between 300,000 and 600,000 years ago			1
@entity33 has been flowing underground , filling cracks and then reappearing above ground farther down the flank			1
the lava has flowed about 8.2 miles from the vent , coming within a mile of the eastern edge of the @entity45			2
officials have estimated that with the lava moving about 820 feet a day , it could reach homes sometime next week			1
on friday , @entity51 officials took a helicopter flight over the area and said the lava was moving very slowly with very little vegetation burning			2
they said the flow had advanced only about 150 yards since the previous day			2
while the agency has yet to issue an evacuation order , some people are trying to move livestock out of the subdivision , including cattle , pigs and horses			2
some residents decided not to tempt fate and leave the area before it is too late			0
' i 'm afraid the lava will head towards the highway , ' @entity68 tells @entity72			2
' otherwise , we would n't be leaving			0
' but some local residents announced during a town hall meeting thursday that they are intent on staying put and letting @entity78 take its course , @entity74 reported			2
' we 're feel like it 's @entity81 doing what @entity81 does , ' said @entity84 resident @entity83 , referring to the volcano goddess ,			2
gov. @entity86 on friday signed an emergency proclamation in preparation for lava crossing a major highway , which could cut off access to communities in the lava 's path			1
his proclamation could allow officials to open abandoned roads as alternate routes			0
this is not an eruption at the caldera , the things that make for stunning pictures as deeply red lava spews from the mountaintop			0
instead , it is lava slowly moving down the volcano 's flank through a heavily forested area			1
the forest 's thick tangles of vegetation and tall trees make it difficult to see , said @entity116 , a spokeswoman for the @entity117			0
this map shows the direction of the lava flow from @entity15 directly towards the community volatile : @entity15 , the youngest volcano on @entity10 , has been continuously erupting since 1983 under threat : the subdivision that lies in the path of the lava flow is in @entity127 , a lush , agricultural district where papaya is a major crop officials do not yet know exactly how many homes could be threatened by the lava flow , and they are conducting door - to - door interviews in the @entity134 to get a count			1
the subdivision is in @entity127 , a lush , agricultural district where papaya is a major crop			0
everyone in the district about a 30 - minute drive from the coastal town of @entity143 lives on the volcano			1
officials have warned residents in the greater @entity127 region to be on alert because the lava could change direction and threaten other communities			0
the state @entity152 advised residents near the lava flow to prepare for smoke from burning vegetation and low levels of sulfur dioxide			1
the smoke could trigger respiratory conditions			0
why would someone live on an active volcano ? unlike @entity165 , the state 's biggest city on the island of @entity168 , the @entity10 's @entity127 region still has affordable land and can offer a more rural way of life			1
located on the island 's southeast side , the area is made up of subdivisions like @entity34 that have unpaved roads of volcanic rock that are not maintained by the county			0
' it 's got a country - style living that appeals to people and that 's somewhat rare in @entity11 , ' county spokesman @entity179 said			1
' people there live off the grid on solar and catchment water systems			0
it 's sort of an independent type of person who 's willing to rough it a little bit			0
' people who live there also know the risks			0
@entity179 said there are special insurance requirements to buy land in certain lava zones			0
no one knows for sure if the lava flow will stop , change direction or hit homes			1
it also is difficult to predict when the flow will stop or if it will start again from another vent			0
this aug. 12 , 2014 photo released by the @entity20 shows a fluid lava stream within the main tube of the june 27 lava flow from the @entity15 volcano slow but deadly : officials have estimated that with the lava creeping about 820 feet a day , it could reach homes sometime next week in the 1990s , about 200 homes were destroyed by lava flows from @entity15			1
the last evacuations from the volcano came in 2011			0
one home was destroyed and others were threatened before the lava changed course			0
@entity15 is home to @entity81 , the @entity224 volcano goddess			1
at a community meeting thursday , some residents expressed anger at suggestions to divert the flow			0
they say it 's culturally insensitive to interfere with @entity81 's will			0
officials with @entity11 's tourism industry say there 's no need for potential visitors to alter their vacation plans			2
the lava flow is an isolated event and wo n't affect plans to snorkel , surf or tan .			1

@entity33 flowing from @entity15 volcano is threatening the @entity31 subdivision and the town of @entity26 on the @entity10
scientists warn if the lava flow continues on its path , it could rural homes in five to seven days
