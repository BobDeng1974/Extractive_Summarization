published : 19:37 est , 15 october 2012 updated : 06:31 est , 16 october 2012 amateur astronomers have discovered a new planet that not only orbits two suns but is simultaneously being orbited by two other suns			1
the incredible four sun solar system , the first of its kind ever discovered , was found as part of the @entity9 project led by a team from @entity11			1
amateur enthusiasts work alongside professional scientists to analyse data collected by @entity16 's kepler space telescope and find evidence of new worlds the planet , called @entity20 , a gas giant slightly bigger than @entity21 , has being likened to @entity22 , the fictional two - sun planet and childhood home of @entity26 from the @entity28 films			1
deep space discovery : an artist 's illustration of @entity20 , orbiting its two ' parent ' suns with its other two suns far off in the distance the @entity9 project is a citizen science project run by @entity11 and the @entity39 web site			1
participants help sieve through data taken by the @entity44 space mission			0
these data consist of brightness measurements , or " light curves , " taken every thirty minutes for more than 150,000 stars			0
users search for possible transit events , which appear as a brief dip in brightness that occurs when a planet passes in front of the star , with the goal of discovering a planet - hence the name ' @entity9 '			2

but while @entity22 is a circumbinary planet , the likes of which have been known to scientists for some time , @entity20 takes things even further with an extra two suns orbiting the entire set - up			1
it means if someone were able to stand on @entity20 , they would be able to see a double sunset as well as two extremely bright stars far off in the night sky			2
the quadruple star system , roughly 3,200 light - years from @entity74 , has been named @entity75 4862625			2
' it 's fascinating to try and imagine what it would be like to visit a planet with four @entity80 in its sky , but this new world is confusing astronomers - it 's not at all clear how it formed in such a busy environment , â€™ said dr @entity85 , of @entity86 , one of the @entity88 team			2
@entity89 , a professor of astronomy at @entity11 , and one of the founders of the @entity9 project said : ' this unique system might have been entirely missed if not for the sharp eyes of the public			1
' @entity20 was discovered by @entity9 volunteers , @entity98 of @entity99 , @entity100 , and @entity101 of @entity102 , @entity103 , who were using the transit method			2
this involves noticing faint dips in light as the planet passed in front of , or transited , its parent stars			2
mr @entity101 said he was ' absolutely ecstatic ' about the finding adding : ' it 's a great honor to be a @entity9 , citizen scientist , and work hand in hand with professional astronomers , making a real contribution to science			0
' the newly discovered @entity20 planet is depicted in this artist 's rendition transiting the larger of the two eclipsing stars it orbits			1
in the distance are a second pair of stars bound to the planetary system			0
mr @entity98 said in a statement : ' it still continues to astonish me how we can detect , let alone glean so much information , about another planet thousands of light - years away just by studying the light from its parent star			0
' after being discovered through planet hunters , @entity20 's existence has been confirmed by a team of professional astronomers , who present their findings at the annual meeting of the @entity142 of the @entity143 in @entity144 , @entity145 @entity20 is roughly 6.2 times the size of @entity74			1
it spends 138 days completing a single orbit around its two suns , one of which is 1.5 times the size and the other 0.41 the size of @entity74 's sun. those two suns circle one another every 20 days			0
the two other suns orbit @entity20 's twin suns at a distance of roughly 93,000,000,000 miles - 1,000 times that between the @entity74 and the sun. science fiction : @entity20 is being likened to @entity22 , the fictional two - sun planet and childhood home of @entity26 from the @entity28 films @entity20 's temperature is estimated to range from a minimum of about 484 degrees @entity167 ( 251 degrees @entity168 ) to a maximum of 644 degrees ( 340 degrees c ) , far too hot to bear life			1
so far scientists have identified six circumbinary planets but none of these have further suns orbiting them			0
in a draft research article the @entity11 rearchers noted : ' although @entity20 is a gas giant planet , even if there is a possibility of rocky moons orbiting the body , their surfaces would be too hot for liquid water to exist			1
' one of the team @entity185 explains : ' @entity187 planets are the extremes of planet formation			0
' the discovery of these systems is forcing us to go back to the drawing board to understand how such planets can assemble and evolve in these dynamically challenging environments			0
' the @entity44 telescope was launched in march 2009 and has already evidence of more than 2,300 possible alien worlds .			0
