with her phone turned off during her 11 - hour flight , @entity0 had no idea of the furore her tweet had caused or that people were now baying for her blood			1

she was subsequently sacked and the public humiliation did n't stop there			2
people continued to troll her and more dirt was dug from her deleted @entity1 account with @entity58 posting an article called ' @entity60 '			0
now more than a year on , @entity0 has spoken of the negative impact the incident has had on her life and how she never intended the tweet to be taken literally			1
' only an insane person would think that white people do n't get @entity13 , ' she told best - selling @entity68 writer @entity67 as she features in his latest book so you 've been publicly shamed			1
' i thought there was no way that anyone could possibly think it was literal			1
' she added that she bitterly regrets posting the comment : ' unfortunately , i am not a character on ‘ @entity78 ’ or a comedian , so i had no business commenting on the epidemic in such a politically incorrect manner on a public platform			0
@entity0 's tweet , pictured here , enraged thousands of people who said she was racist and ignorant ' to put it simply , i was n't trying to raise awareness of @entity13 or p * * * off the world or ruin my life			1
' living in @entity93 puts us in a bit of a bubble when it comes to what is going on in the third world			0
i was making fun of that bubble			0
' @entity67 , whose previous works include @entity103 and @entity104 , interviewed @entity0 as he sought to investigate the impact a social media storm has on the ordinary people lambasted			2
describing his motivation for the book , he wrote in the @entity110 : ' as time passed , i watched these shame campaigns multiply , to the point that they targeted not just powerful institutions and public figures but really anyone perceived to have done something offensive			2
' i also began to marvel at the disconnect between the severity of the crime and the gleeful savagery of the punishment			0
it almost felt as if shamings were now happening for their own sake , as if they were following a script			0
' @entity0 tells how her public shaming left her jobless and affected her health and wellbeing			2
she said : ' i cried out my body weight in the first 24 hours			0
you wake up in the middle of the night forgetting where you are			0
' while she regrets sending her tweet , she 's also resentful of the way its interpretation led to her downfall - and how people she did n't even know seemed to take pleasure in her misfortune			2
@entity67 , left , has interviewed @entity0 for his latest book so you 've been publicly shamed , right ' i had a great career , and i loved my job , and it was taken away from me , and there was a lot of glory in that			1
everybody else was very happy about that , ' she said			0
she added that it has also ruined her love life : ' i 'm single ; so it 's not like i can date , because we @entity160 everyone we might date			0
that 's been taken away from me too			0
' @entity0 told @entity67 that she realised she ' could n't sit at home and watch movies every day and cry and feel sorry for myself ' forever and she needed to ' make steps to reclaim my identity and remind myself of who i am '			1
as a result , she now has a new job and is wary of what she shares on social media			0
she told @entity67 other than contributing to his book , she wo n't be speaking out about her story again			2
shame : miss @entity0 pictured after landing in @entity11 as the scandal broke ' anything that puts the spotlight on me is a negative , ' she told him			1
in his book , @entity67 compares social media condemnation to the public floggings of centuries ago			0
he urges people to consider what they post online both in regards to sharing their own views or commenting on the views of others			0
he said of @entity0 's journey : ' when i first met her , she was desperate to tell the tens of thousands of people who tore her apart how they had wronged her and to repair what remained of her public persona			1
' but perhaps she had now come to understand that her shaming was n't really about her at all			0
' social media is so perfectly designed to manipulate our desire for approval , and that is what led to her undoing			0
' her tormentors were instantly congratulated as they took @entity0 down , bit by bit , and so they continued to do so			2
their motivation was much the same as @entity0 's own - a bid for the attention of strangers - as she milled about @entity210 , hoping to amuse people she could n't see			1
' @entity67 's book so you 've been @entity214 will be published by @entity215 on 12th march			2
