' you could see it shrivel up right away			0
the crew had very little to offer in terms of treatments or medication			0
' there were some foam pads and some cream but there was no first aid cubicle on the plane so we had to treat the wound in the toilet			0
' it brings up a whole load of health and safety issues			0
there were big cracks in the flask and the seal had come off			0
these things should be checked			0
' @entity90 : mr @entity8 had just boarded the @entity5 flight to @entity10 with his wife when he had the hot water poured on him accidentally cabin crew arranged for a paramedic to meet the couple when the flight landed in @entity97 before @entity8 was taken to a first aid station within the airport			1

' mrs @entity100 added : ' i feel we have been brushed aside			0
we just want things to be checked properly - and the toilet is not the best place to treat an open wound			0
