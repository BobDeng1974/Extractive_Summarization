every blue - chip firm listed in @entity9 fell in the worst single day of trading since the dark days of 2008 when investment bank @entity11 imploded			0
as analysts spoke of ' a tidal wave of selling ' , the @entity12 fell 239.37 points to 5092.23 – a drop in value of £ 62.3billion			1

the @entity11 debacle tipped the global economy into recession – and fears are mounting that the developed world is on the brink of another devastating downturn			1
one reason for the panic was the revelation that a lender in the eurozone was forced to go cap in hand to the @entity41 for £ 300million in emergency funding			1
analysts said the ' worrying ' development showed banks are too nervous to lend to each other – just as they were at the height of the financial crisis			1
@entity50 giant @entity49 warned yesterday that the @entity22 and the eurozone are ' hovering dangerously close to recession '			1
despair may have engulfed the markets , but one @entity7 entrepreneur found himself £ 300million richer yesterday			1
dr @entity56 , the son of an @entity58 fireman , saw his software firm @entity59 sold to @entity22 giant @entity60 for £ 7billion			1
the deal values his 8.1 per cent stake in the @entity12 firm at £ 567million			1
it was worth just under £ 284million before the takeover bid was announced			0
it is an extraordinary success for dr @entity56 , who began work on the firm when he was writing his post-doctoral thesis at @entity70 on 18th century theologian @entity71 , who tried to prove the existence of @entity73 through mathematics			0
@entity59 now has more than 16,000 clients worldwide including @entity76 , @entity77 , and the @entity22 @entity78			1
the technology dr @entity56 developed allows computers to analyse data across a range of media , making it useful for tracking down fraud or even searching for terrorists			0
investors are also increasingly concerned about the health of the banking system in @entity90 as the debt - crisis crippling the single currency bloc rumbles on			0
officials at the @entity94 said the exaggerated sense of fear in the markets may be holding back the recovery			1
the man who became a hate figure to many in @entity7 for designing the modern @entity102 yesterday admitted that it was now ' on the edge of the precipice '			0
@entity106 , 86 , a federalist @entity107 , used his time as @entity110 chief in the 1980s to expand its power over national governments and pave the way for the single @entity90 currency			1
@entity115 , at @entity116 in @entity9 , said : ' panic selling accelerated in the biggest losing day yet of this summer sell - off			1
' the fear factor has reached boiling point			0
banking stocks have been decimated across @entity90 , with indiscriminate selling even in banks that maintain that their exposure to the crisis is slim			2
' no sector is surviving this tidal wave of selling			1
' damaging confidence : analysts say @entity24 chancellor @entity132 and @entity107 president @entity134 's plans to bail out debt - ridden eurozone members would disproportionately hit the @entity7 the financial markets have been rocked by a crisis of leadership in recent weeks as politicians on both sides of the @entity142 failed to come up with policies to tackle debts and promote growth			1
the @entity12 has lost 1,000 points , or £ 260billion of its value , since its 2011 peak in february			0
dark days : today 's jobless figures have done nothing for @entity153 's domestic standing the majority of the slump has taken place this month in one of the most bruising episodes in stock market history			1
it has hit the value of retirement pots for millions and left investors across the country nursing heavy losses			2
@entity7 bank shares were the worst hit in @entity9 yesterday with taxpayer - supported @entity168 down 11.3 per cent and @entity169 down 9.3 per cent			1
the shares are worth less than half what they were when the government bailed the banks out – meaning @entity7 taxpayers are sitting on losses of £ 34.5billion in the two companies			0
the @entity90 banking sector has lost 30 per cent of its value this year			2
@entity107 banks were back in the firing line yesterday with @entity182 down 11.6 per cent			1

' this shows that the situation has escalated , ' said @entity190 analyst @entity189			0
@entity49 cut its global growth forecasts for this year from 4.2 per cent to 3.9 per cent and for 2012 from 4.5 per cent to 3.8 per cent			1
' the path now looks even more bumpy , below - par and brittle than previously thought , ' said @entity193 , who co-heads @entity49 's global economic team			1
he said the main reason for the downturn was the failure of politicians and regulators in @entity202 and @entity90 to tackle the sovereign debt crisis crippling the world economy			0
hundreds of thousands of families in the @entity7 are over-indebted and ' vulnerable ' if financial conditions get worse , a senior @entity94 director said last night			0
@entity208 , the @entity41 's executive director in charge of ensuring financial stability , said one in 14 @entity7 households is in negative equity			0
analysis by @entity215 , associate city editor ' the only thing we have to fear is fear itself ' : president @entity220 signing the @entity221 at the @entity222 in 1933 during his inaugural address in 1933 , newly elected @entity22 president @entity220 famously told the @entity22 people : ' the only thing we have to fear is fear itself			1
' today , the world is clouded with economic and political uncertainty just as it was in the dark days following the @entity229 and the @entity230			0
as people are forced to watch impotently as stock markets lurch once again into turmoil , wiping billions of pounds off the value of their savings and pensions , it is understandable that many are riven with anxiety			1
fear is stalking the trading floors and it is contagious , casting an ominous shadow over all of our lives			0
but the question is whether the extreme reactions we have seen on the stock markets over the past few weeks are justified			1
as @entity208 , a senior director at the @entity94 , pointed out yesterday , the fear factor is rampant on the markets			2
not all of it is rational , and these waves of terror engulfing the stock exchanges are actually making matters worse			2
during the boom , traders were swept along by a wave of euphoria and loaded themselves with risks that proved to be wildly over-optimistic			2
@entity208 now believes the markets may have switched to the opposite pole , with traders abnormally reluctant to take risks because the psychological scarring from the losses of the last meltdown is still fresh and painful			2
that exaggerated fear of risk – equally irrational as the mindless exuberance of the boom years – is in itself a brake on economic recovery			0
when stock markets plunge , companies become reluctant to expand or invest			1
consumers cut down on their spending and stay out of the shops			0
instead of applying our energy to creating growth , building new businesses and embarking on new ventures , firms and individuals retreat into a paralysing state of gloom and timidity			0
with markets in the paranoid state of the past few weeks , even minor or quite predictable pieces of news can produce enormous swings on the trading screens			2
no - one should underestimate the power of herd - behaviour on the markets , which are driven by the opposing forces of greed and fear			2
driven by greed and fear : a man walks past the @entity305 in the @entity306			0
a @entity70 study found hormone levels significantly affected traders ' behaviour @entity70 researchers even found in a study of saliva from @entity315 workers that hormonal activity among young male traders magnified the booms and busts			0
they discovered that when dealers hit a winning streak their testosterone levels soared , making them overconfident and intoxicated with their own success			2
but when markets dipped , the researchers saw a rise in the stress hormone cortisol , which made the dealers shy of risk and magnified the downward slide in markets			2
but there are some very good reasons to be fearful			0
the banking crisis that caused the market meltdown in 2008 has transformed itself into a sovereign debt crisis			2
question marks now hover over the indebtedness not only of smaller nations such as @entity339 and @entity340 , but even the @entity22 , whose @entity342 bonds were once considered impregnable			1
many households , banks and countries remain dangerously mired under the weight of their own foolish borrowings			2
keep calm and carry on : a stock market trader grips his forehead as shares tumble in this picture from the 2008 crash			1
dealers can and do wipe millions from the value of shares as the mood takes them but panic does not help			0
we should not allow the economic recovery in this country to be held hostage to hysteria in the dealing rooms			0
the dealers can and do wipe billions of pounds off share values as the mood takes them – often for the points slashed from the @entity12 to be restored the next day			0
but whatever their frenzy leads them to do , most of the real assets that are vital to our economy remain unaffected			0
our homes , offices and factories are still standing ; we still have our brainpower and most of all our resilience			0
to use another catchphrase from the 1930s , when markets succumb to a bout of madness , we need to ' @entity385 .			0
