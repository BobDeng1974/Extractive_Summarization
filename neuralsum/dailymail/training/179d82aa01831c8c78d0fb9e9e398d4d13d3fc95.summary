veteran @entity0 , 55 , wants to meet the family of the @entity3 soldier he claims he killed with a bayonet during the @entity5 a @entity5 veteran who wants to meet the family of an @entity3 soldier he claims to have killed during the 1982 conflict was accused last night of fabricating his story			1
former guardsman @entity0 , 55 , made international headlines last week after issuing an emotional appeal to come face - to - face with the relatives of @entity14 – who he says he stabbed to death on @entity17 , near the islands ’ capital , @entity20			1
in a story published by @entity22 , the guardsman , who has suffered mental health issues since the campaign , said he wanted to achieve ‘ closure ’ and to explain his actions to the deceased soldier ’s family			1
but last night a senior @entity31 army officer said @entity0 ’s account was ‘ completely untrue ’			1
@entity0 , who served with @entity33 , @entity34 , gave an interview during which he described graphically bayonetting an @entity3 soldier			1
‘ i stabbed him through the neck with my bayonet , ’ he said			1
‘ he was screaming in @entity40			0
i had to put my foot on his face to get my bayonet out			2
the blood came rushing out			0
i was covered from head to foot			0
’ @entity0 said he was now trying to trace the victim ’s family using details on his helmet , which he has kept ever since			1
@entity0 , from @entity51 , @entity52 , added : ‘ i ’d like to return the helmet , for closure on my behalf			1
they may not want it			0
they ’d probably hate me			0
but i would like to explain to them why it happened			0
’ @entity14 was identified as the owner of the helmet by an @entity3 newspaper , which then tracked down members of his family , who apparently burst into tears			1
the story was subsequently published by @entity22 under the headline ‘ @entity31 @entity70 veteran to meet family of @entity3 soldier he killed			1
’ a retired commander said the company of the @entity34 ( file picture ) @entity0 was in did not have bayonets fixed to their weapons but @entity0 ’s account has been challenged by several @entity70 veterans , including a retired commander who led the @entity34 on @entity17			1
the senior officer told @entity82 : ‘ i am afraid that this is completely untrue			1
the guardsmen of @entity33 did not see any enemy and therefore did not have bayonets fixed			0
for 200 yards around us there were no @entity3			2
’ told of the doubts about his account , @entity0 said : ‘ they are wrong			2
why would i lie about something like that ? my company was the first to reach that position and there were no casualties			0
it was after the rest of the battalion moved up that we were left dealing with pockets of @entity3 soldiers			2
that is when it happened			0
’ @entity0 also claimed one of his colleagues from the battle , @entity107 , witnessed his actions			2
but mr @entity107 , who has now left the @entity109 , said : ‘ i was not with @entity0 and i never saw him that night or witnessed any such action			2
‘ also , i do n’t know of anyone in @entity33 who engaged the enemy			0
i would take what he ’s saying with a pinch of salt			0
it ’s a shame as everyone has their demons to deal with			0
’ the @entity121 and @entity122 declined to comment .			0
