in 2009 , six - year - old @entity5 was at the center of a media storm after his parents claimed he had boarded a homemade helium - filled flying saucer which had broken free of its restraints and floated away			2
tv cameras captured the frantic chase , until the silver balloon dramatically touched down and the young boy was nowhere to be found			0
with a traumatic experience like that under his belt and still only ten - years - old , it perhaps is n’t that surprising that young @entity5 now appears to have grown into an angsty young boy who has chosen to express himself through the medium of heavy metal music			1
four years on from the balloon incident young @entity5 is fronting the @entity5 , the self - proclaimed ' @entity46 's @entity45			2
' the power trio consist of @entity5 on vocals and bass , @entity50 , 13 , on guitar , and @entity52 , 12 , on drums are playing @entity55 's @entity54 later this month as they celebrate the launch of their second album ' @entity60 '			1

' the band do n't shy away from their hoax - related past and their website proudly makes reference to their ' storm chase adventures ' , plus appearances on tv show @entity94			0
the website also claims that @entity5 ' was born with an unusually high pitch voice that is unique and adds to the metal sound of the band			2
' however that might just be because his voice has n’t broken yet			0
the band list their musical influences as ' @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , to @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and most everything else that is @entity112			0

commentators branded @entity5 ' a shameless self - promoter who would do almost anything to advance his latest endeavor '			0
after that incident the family moved from @entity29 to @entity137 - where @entity5 and his family have been supposedly trying to put the ' @entity5 ' scandal behind them			2
but since then @entity5 has unveiled several further attempts to win fame and wealth			0
in 2011 he launched an idea for a bizarre lifting machine for trucks , while he currently advertises a back scratching device called ' @entity148 , ' through a campaign on @entity150			0
