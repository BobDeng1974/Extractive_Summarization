@entity1 goalkeeper @entity0 insists he does not feel the pressure which comes with the scrutiny of virtually each one of his performances			1
the @entity6 international was dropped in december after a run of shaky displays but since returning on @entity10 - somewhat fortuitously after deputy @entity11 ' was injured - he has looked a different player			1
he has kept six clean sheets in 13 matches since returning to the side , and the two he conceded in tuesday 's midweek win over @entity17 were the first conceded from open play since @entity19			1
@entity1 keeper @entity0 ( right ) celebrates beating @entity17 on tuesday with his team - mates ' day in , day out you are in the spotlight but the main job is to focus on the football , ' he said			1
' you are always going to be under pressure but it is our job and you get used to it			2
' it is not really pressure , it is something you enjoy as everyone likes to play in front of a big crowd			2
' the last few weeks have gone really well so we have to continue in the same manner			0
' we are still battling on all fronts : we have the @entity38 this weekend and then there is the @entity40 and so there is still a lot to play for			0
' @entity0 , attempting to save @entity44 's strike at @entity45 , has made six clean sheets in his last 13 games the @entity6 , working hard on crosses during a training session on thursday , was dropped in december while @entity0 is comfortable being in the spotlight for his goalkeeping he is less so when it comes to his non-football activities			1
the @entity6 , along with @entity54 and @entity55 , is the star of a new television advert after the club announced @entity59 had signed a multi-year agreement to become their official grooming partner			2
as a result , at the launch event at @entity45 , he had to field questions about his pre-match grooming routine			0
' before every game i have a cold shower to wake me up , ' was the extent of his response			0
he found it easier explaining how he coped with the big - match pressure			2
the 26 - year - old has been in impressive form since returning to the @entity1 side on @entity10 last year ' as a goalkeeper especially you have to prepare yourself mentally so i try to keep the same routine from the night before to kick - off , ' he added			1
' you prepare yourself in the same way and if you get a certain routine it makes it easier as well			0
' @entity55 , who has yet to sign an ' incredible ' new contract being offered by the club , revealed he had taken up yoga to help with dealing with all the focus of being one of the hottest young talents in @entity89			0
it is not going as expected for the winger			0
' i 've started yoga but it is nothing like i thought it would be , ' he said			0
@entity0 will face competition for the no 1 jersey from @entity11 ( second left ) who has returned to training ' they 've got me doing press - ups and stuff like that - i thought it was more for meditation			1
' @entity54 , as the principal player in the television advert , was asked whether he could rival @entity108 goalkeeper @entity107 - who has a high - profile shampoo contract - in the @entity111 modelling stakes			2
' i 'd probably have to work on my acting skills a bit , i think @entity114 has got that down to a tee , ' said the @entity118 vice-captain			0
@entity0 was speaking at an event to announce @entity59 , the world 's number one men 's skin care brand , has become the official men 's grooming partner for @entity1 .			1
