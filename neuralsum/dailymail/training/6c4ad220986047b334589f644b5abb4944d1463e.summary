by @entity0 glow - in - the - dark trees could soon be a natural alternative to electric street lighting , according to scientists			1
researchers at the @entity7 project from @entity8 have transferred the glowing genes seen in fireflies , in to plants to make them glow - in - the - dark			1
the team is now hoping to extend the technique to larger plants and trees , and use them to replace electric lights			1
they have taken genes from fireflies , glow worms and other bacteria that create naturally - occurring light and added it to household plants			1
the team is hoping that luminescent trees could replace electric street lighting the genes used in the @entity7 project are taken from glow worms and fireflies that create natural light through what 's called bioluminescence			1
the genes are added to agrobacteria , and this agrobacteria transfers these genes to the plants , which makes them glow - in - the - dark @entity48 is an enzyme used in bioluminescence			0
the name comes from @entity52			0
@entity52 is @entity53 for lucem ferrem , which means ' light - bearer '			0
fireflies , glow worms and jellyfish can regulate how much light they produce by using different lucieferases in a range of ways			1
the enzyme can also be found in some bacteria and @entity66 mushrooms			0
@entity67 from the @entity68 , with @entity69 and @entity70 have been creating glow - in - the - dark plants in a @entity73 biolab in @entity8			2
the team were inspired by fireflies and glow worms that both produce what 's called bioluminescence			1
bioluminescence is the process that makes these creatures produce naturally - occurring light from their bodies			0
the team start off by getting glowing protein enzymes called @entity48 , from the genes of fireflies or from bacteria			2
they then use software called @entity92 to make it possible for the plants to read what those genes are			0
the genes are then made in labs and shipped to the team in @entity8			2
this chart from the @entity7 project shows how the team creates the glow - in - the - dark plants , which could be used to replace electrical street lighting the @entity8 scientists have tested their technology on a range of plants in their diy biolab			1
anyone who pledges money to the project 's @entity113 campaign can get a glow - in - the - dark rose , or be given the chance to buy one before anyone else @entity67 and his team put these genes into liquid agrobacteria and the bacteria is poured over the plants			2
@entity123 is able to transfer genes into plants , and when these glowing genes are added , they are transferred to the plants , which makes them glow - in - the - dark			2
to create these genes , the scientists have had to redesign the dna sequence			0
they have successfully managed to create small glowing plants and are now asking for extra funding , via a @entity113 campaign , to use the technology on larger plants and trees			1
the campaign ends on 7 june			0
so far it has had more than 5,000 backers and raised over Â£ 183,000			0
video : @entity143 's idea to develop glowing plants to light streets			0

scientists in @entity8 have used genes from fireflies and glow worms to create glowing plants
the team wants to extend their research to larger plants and create an alternative to electric lighting
