captain cook may not have been the first @entity1 to settle in @entity2 after all			2
a 16th - century - style @entity4 cannon , that was discovered by a 13 - year - old boy off a remote beach in the @entity7 in 2010 , has reignited the debate over who first arrived in the country			1
research has shown the lead that the cannon is made from is linked to an ancient @entity15 mine , meaning the historic artifact could have arrived in @entity2 before lieutenant @entity0 stepped off @entity17 in 1770			1
the @entity4 may have even brought the swivel gun to the country before the @entity20 made the first official @entity1 sighting of @entity2 in early 1606			1
rare find : the 16th - century - style @entity4 cannon ( held here by an unknown man ) was discovered by a 13 - year - old boy off a remote beach in the @entity7 in 2010 teenager @entity28 unearthed the historic swivel gun at @entity30 , about 120km southwest of @entity31 , four years ago , when tides dipped to exceptional lows in january 2010 meaning he could walk out a long way from shore			1
he saw the 107cm - long gun , an anti-personnel light artillery piece , poking out of mud , dug it out with his father and took it back to his home			1
@entity42 occupied @entity43 from 1515 until 1975 and it has long been hotly debated whether @entity4 explorers made it all the way to @entity2 , about 700km away			1
discoverer : in 1770 , @entity0 made the first @entity1 landing on @entity2 's east coast			2
here he is shown in a 1776 oil canvas by @entity50 , displayed in the @entity51 claimed : @entity52 became the first @entity1 power to officially claim any area on the @entity2 mainland thanks to @entity0 research by the @entity57 has shown that the lead in the cannon most closely resembled metal found at the ancient @entity62 mine in the @entity64 region in @entity15 's south			1
the historians compared lead in the cannon to ore samples obtained from 2000 @entity1 sources and ruled out the theory that the gun was a later @entity74 copy of the @entity4 swivel			1
a @entity31 - based heritage group , @entity77 , said yesterday that the findings showed the lead in the gun was mined on the @entity80			1
' it is simply likely therefore that the gun is of similar origin			0
@entity1 origin should n't be discounted just because it is obvious			0
' this truly is the smoking gun of the @entity4 discovery of northern @entity2 , ' a spokesman for the group , @entity87 , told @entity90			1
last year , @entity2 scientist @entity91 - also a member of the @entity93 - said the find will help rewrite the nation 's history			2
historical : this is one of the first ever maps of @entity2 and shows an adventurer 's ship and what looks like a platypus off the coast ' the cannon is one of the most significant historical artifacts ever found in northern @entity2 , ' he said			1
however , the man who tested the lead - @entity111 , of the @entity57 - said that even if it was from the @entity15 mine , it remained a possibility that the lead could have been recycled from another object and used to make the gun in @entity74			2
' lead objects were frequently melted down and recast , so the gun could have been manufactured elsewhere , ' he said			0
the cannon went on display in @entity31 this week			0
mr @entity28 claimed he and his father knew that cannon was ' old ' when he found it , back in 2010			0
' as soon as we got it back into @entity31 my dad got an angle grinder and nicked a little bit of it			0
we saw it was bronze , so we knew it was old , ' he told the @entity133			0
the cannon is n't the first artifact that has suggested @entity2 might need to rewrite its history books			0
ancient @entity140 kingdom @entity138 coins , believed to date from about 1100 , came to be discovered on the @entity141 off the @entity7 in 1944 and have long posed questions about foreign visits to far off @entity2 shores			2
@entity145 @entity2 are thought to have first arrived on the @entity2 mainland by boat from the @entity148 between 40,000 and 60,000 years ago			0
@entity149 , 16th - century @entity151 world maps which depict a large land mass between @entity153 and @entity154 , have led some to believe that the @entity151 then became the first @entity1 to discover @entity2 in the 1500s			1
@entity151 navigator @entity156 claimed to have landed at ' east of the @entity157 ' in 1504 , after being blown off course			0
but the place that he reached , which some believed to be @entity2 , has now been proven to be @entity159			0
there have also been persistent theories that @entity4 navigators reached @entity2 between 1521 and 1524 , in part because of the @entity149 maps which are thought to be based on @entity4 charts			1
a number of relics and remains - including the cannon - have been interpreted as evidence that the @entity4 reached @entity2 first			1
what we know for certain , is that @entity20 navigator @entity172 made the first documented @entity1 landing on the @entity2 continent in 1606 , at @entity175			2
the first @entity176 to land on the @entity2 mainland was @entity178 , a former pirate			2
he reached the northwest coast , near @entity180 , on 5 january 1688 after his ship the @entity183 , a small trading vessel , was beached			0
then , in 1770 , @entity0 made the first @entity1 landing on @entity2 's east coast			0
@entity52 thereby became the first @entity1 power to officially claim any area on the @entity2 mainland .			0

@entity4 , 16th - century - style , 107cm - long swivel gun was found in 2010
boy , 13 , discovered it on a beach about two hours from @entity31
researchers say cannon 's lead was mined on @entity15 @entity80
suggests the @entity4 reached @entity2 before the @entity20 and @entity176
