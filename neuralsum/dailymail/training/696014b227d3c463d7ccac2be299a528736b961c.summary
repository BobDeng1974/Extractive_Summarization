by @entity0 published : 10:51 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 09:29 est , 19 april 2013 from bright crimson to eye - popping cerise , there are few shades of lipstick that beauty blogger @entity6 wo n't try			1
now , the blogger has set herself the challenge of wearing a completely new hue everyday for an entire year , and is documenting her make - up challenge on @entity11 and her blog , @entity13			1
@entity6 , who is on her 182nd new lipstick said : ' i never thought i get this far , but indeed i have and it 's been a pleasure everyday			1
yes , there have been days when i did n't really want to put on any make - up , days when the lipstick i chose just did n't look right and days when , gloriously , it all came together			1
' the lipstick fan , who also writes for @entity24 ! @entity26 and online magazine @entity25 added : ' but most of all , each and every day has made me realise how just a slick of lipstick can change your mood			1
' a bright lipstick and suddenly , the world seems a little less hostile			2
people smile as they pass you in the street , ask you what shade you 're wearing and new conversations are struck up - all because of a lipstick			2
