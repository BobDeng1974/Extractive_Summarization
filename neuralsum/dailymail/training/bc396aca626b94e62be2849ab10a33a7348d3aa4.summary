the style set is once again embracing a rather risqu√© take on the traditional tuxedo trend by wearing the low - cut style without anything on underneath			1
the look , which rose to fashion fame six years ago thanks to @entity8 and @entity9 , was seen on @entity10 and @entity11 on the red carpet at the @entity13 last night and has recently been worn by everyone from @entity15 to @entity17 star @entity16			1
while some stars choose to style the low - cut jacket by itself , accessorizing only with jewelry and a handbag as @entity10 did with her @entity23 design at the @entity24 , other fans of the trend prefer to model a full tuxedo , as often worn by @entity15 and her fellow @entity29 model @entity30			1
while @entity15 chose a beaded @entity29 gown for her red carpet appearance at the star - studded event , at which she picked up the award for @entity66 , the model - turned - actress has often made clear her fondness for the tuxedo trend in the past			2
during the past year , @entity15 has been spotted out and about sporting a number of tuxedo - style ensembles			2
favoring @entity29 's classic colored designs , the star wore a burgundy numebr at @entity76 's @entity75 in @entity77 - where she matched her look to close friend @entity30 , who also wore a @entity29 design - before choosing a blue style to wear to @entity29 's @entity81 show in september			0
switching it up : @entity84 executive creative director @entity83 is also a fan of the tuxedo trend the style has also been seen on the likes of @entity16 - who wore a black @entity54 tuxedo dress to the premiere of her film @entity91 at the @entity92 earlier this year - and @entity50 - who opted for a quirky zebra - print jacket when she stepped out at @entity94 in february			2
meanwhile @entity51 styled her chic @entity96 tux with a matching pair of trousers at the 2014 @entity99 in october			0
it is not the first time that the low - cut look has been worn by such a variety of high - profile fashion icons			1
designer @entity9 , who picked up the coveted award for @entity106 at last night 's ceremony , wore a sequined tuxedo jacket to attend @entity110 's 2008 @entity109 alongside her former @entity112 bandmates			0
number one fan : @entity15 has worn a number of different tuxedo styles during the last few months , including at an event in @entity118 ( @entity43 ) and at @entity81 ( r ) @entity120 style : the @entity29 model also opted for a tuxedo when she attended a @entity29 event in @entity124 former @entity126 star @entity125 turned heads when she arrived at the 2012 @entity128 wearing a revealing white tuxedo dress by designer @entity130			0
but , while the popular trend has helped many stars to showcase the perfect amount of skin , the low - cut style in not without its risks			1
in march 2009 , @entity8 suffered an unfortunate wardrobe malfunction when she slipped out of her @entity139 jacket shortly after leaving @entity141 mogul sir @entity143 's 57th birthday party in @entity77			0
fashion favorite : the style was previously favored by the likes of @entity9 ( r ) and @entity8 , who suffered an unfortunate wardrobe malfunction when she slipped out of her @entity139 tuxedo at sir @entity143 's birthday party			0
