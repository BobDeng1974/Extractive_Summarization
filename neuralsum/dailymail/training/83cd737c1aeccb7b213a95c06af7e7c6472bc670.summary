by @entity0 published : 09:14 est , 12 june 2012 updated : 18:55 est , 12 june 2012 she was a world - class athlete and one of our top medal hopes for the @entity5			1
modelling her @entity8 kit earlier this year , triathlete @entity6 appeared to be in peak physical condition			1
but she shook the sports world when she announced she was ending her career – revealing that she was suffering from an overpowering eating disorder			1
single - minded : triathlete @entity6 , pictured on the @entity14 , was one of @entity16 's top triathletes before her eating disorder forced her to give up the sport now the 22 - year - old has revealed the full extent of her battle with food , admitting perfectionism caused her to be ‘ her own worst enemy ’			1
she said her five - year struggle with weight loss stemmed from an off - the - cuff comment by a coach			1
she explained : ‘ when i was 16 i competed at the @entity29 , coming 11 out of 80 girls			1
i was really chuffed but my coach said , “ @entity32 wo n’t make you faster @entity6 , losing weight will make you run faster			1
you need to watch that weight of yours ”			1
‘ i was shocked , ’ she went on			2
‘ nobody had ever mentioned my weight before and i did n’t think there was anything wrong with it – but i instantly took it to heart			2
‘ in the weeks that followed i weighed myself constantly and cut down my food			2
i did n’t for a moment realise that what i was doing was abnormal			2
’ troubled : the 22 - year - old would watch recordings of races to compare her shape to that of her competitors ‘ i was my own worst enemy			1
i trained at the weekend with senior athletes and i would look at what they were eating			1
‘ i ’d notice they would n’t have butter on their bread and would only eat salad			2
i thought , “ well if they ’re doing it , i should too ”			2
’ the coach ’s comment saw the teenager drastically reduce her calorie intake			2
while female athletes typically require around 3,000 calories a day , @entity6 cut her meals down to only porridge , made with water rather than milk , a whole lettuce and a cereal bar			1
but her high - powered three - hour daily workout would leave her feeling weak			0
she told @entity76 magazine : ‘ my training definitely suffered because of my diet			0
in swimming i was so thin i ’d get too cold in the water			0
i also struggled to float as i did n’t have the buoyancy			0
but i was addicted to not eating and kept getting thinner and thinner			0
’ after winning the @entity81 in 2007 , she began to think that eating less was the key to her success			0
but then the disease began to eat away at her			0
she was tired and agitated and suffered from repeated colds and illnesses			0
she only realised that she needed help after her parents saw her bony spine protruding from her kit			0
painfully self - conscious : left , at the @entity91 and right , with @entity92 after winning the @entity93 in @entity94 she was persuaded to see a nutritionist , but it was n’t until she suffered stress fractures that she decided to abandon her 2012 dreams last month			0
although she has described the decision as heartbreaking , @entity6 now says she is relieved to have escaped the pressure of top level sport before she did permanent damage to her health			1
between 2006 and 2007 , she dropped more than a stone before her trainer @entity105 realised that she had a problem and pushed her towards recovery			0
he discussed the disorder with her parents and showed her statistics that proved she was faster when heavier			0
her condition improved and in 2007 and 2008 a series of wins meant that she was ranked world number one in the triathalon – a multi-sport discipline involving swimming , cycling and running			0
but an unrelated illness wrecked her hopes for the @entity91 and she suffered a recurrence in 2010			0
stress fractures , probably caused by her reduced bone density , and the pressure of @entity125 , caused her final spin into self - doubt , leading to her retirement			0
eating disorders are not unusual among top athletes , according to experts			1
up to 60 per cent of female athletes suffer from eating disorders , according to a 2011 study by researchers at @entity136 , @entity137 .			1

@entity6 , 22 , would compare her body to those of other athletes
ate so few calories she looked like skin and bones in her @entity146
