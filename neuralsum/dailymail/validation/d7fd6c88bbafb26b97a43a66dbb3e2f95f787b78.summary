@entity1 defender @entity0 has ' no doubt ' @entity3 will claim the @entity5 title after witnessing their winning habit first hand			1
@entity12 's men restored their six - point lead over @entity14 with a 3 - 2 victory at the @entity16 on sunday , substitute @entity8 grabbing the winner after the @entity10 let an early two - goal lead slip			1
relegation battlers @entity1 pressed hard for an unlikely decider of their own with the scores tied but @entity3 held on and took their chance when it came			1
@entity3 's @entity22 is stopped by @entity1 's @entity0 and @entity23 and for @entity25 international @entity0 , those are the qualities that will stand them apart at the end of the campaign			1
' there 's no doubt @entity3 will be champions , ' he said			2
' i ca n't see past them and to be honest i have n't been able to see past them for a while now			0
' if they 're not at their best they have a manager in @entity12 who gets them to grind out results and that 's what they 've done again , that 's the side they are			2
' it 's three more points and a step closer to the title			2
' at 2 - 2 we were able to press them higher and make chances , which they did n't deal with too well , but they ground it out and that 's why they are going to be champions			1
' @entity8 scored @entity3 's winner minutes after coming on in the second half @entity8 's shot crept past @entity61 and over the line to give @entity3 a 3 - 2 win the @entity64 may not have improved their own position at the wrong end of the table , but the manner in which they took on the front - runners can at least leave them in good heart			1
they have arguably the toughest run - in of the bottom five , with @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 still to come , and the ability to compete with the top sides will be a must			2
' i do n't think we can fault our performance after going 2 - 0 down to the soon - to - be champions in the first 10 minutes , ' said @entity0			2
' our two strikers had their centre - backs on toast , they could n't deal with our lads at all			2
@entity89 fired @entity3 into an early lead but they were pegged back by @entity1 before half time hazard celebrates his excellent strike that put @entity3 ahead early on ' @entity94 and @entity95 are two very good defenders but credit to our strikers , they made them look very ordinary			1
unfortunately for us their keeper was on great form			0
' if you look at our results we 've already picked up points against @entity74 , @entity14 , @entity73 and we 've run @entity3 close twice now , so we take a lot of positives from that			1
' a point would have been a bonus but we 're glad nobody else picked anything up so we 've lost no ground			0
' had @entity3 lost points , @entity114 ' first - half gaffe for @entity1 's equaliser would surely have become a bigger talking point			1
the @entity119 goalkeeper inexplicably miscontrolled @entity121 's back pass straight to striker @entity122 , who was left with an open net for his first goal since october			0
@entity12 's side are six points clear at the top of the @entity5 with the benefit of the three points , not to mention an otherwise superb display from @entity114 , @entity12 was able to sweep the incident aside			1
' if you tell our goalkeeper every time he has a back pass to kick the ball to the stands the second goal does n't come , but we do n't say that , ' he said			0
' he tried to play , lost the rebound , the defenders did n't open a passing line to play from the back : goal			0
' everybody is unhappy , obviously , i am probably the first one			0
' but i told the players at half - time , there is no point now in analysing details and mistakes of the first half			0
the point is to go back to our football			0
' the first minute of the second half the team went back to quality football , to creation , to movement			0
' i think we deserved to win			0

@entity3 beat @entity1 3 - 2 at the @entity16 on sunday
the win means @entity3 lead second place @entity14 by six points
