by @entity0 published : 14:08 est , 6 march 2013 updated : 17:31 est , 6 march 2013 the distance to our nearest galaxy has been accurately calculated by scientists for the first time			1
it is known as the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) and it lies 163,000 light years away - or 49.97 kiloparsecs to be precise			1
the @entity7 is a dwarf galaxy and it floats in space in a long and slow dance around the @entity13 - a similar relationship to that between @entity16 and our moon			1
the small and irregular galaxy includes the @entity36 - the brightest stellar nursery in our cosmic neighbourhood - and is scattered with others , the most noticeable sign new stars are being born			1
the new finding , published in the journal nature , could hold the key to determining the scale of the universe - a mystery that has dumbfounded the world 's greatest minds for decades			1
previous measures of this distance have had limited accuracy to around five to ten per cent but the latest is accurate to 2.2 per cent			0
astronomer dr @entity54 and colleagues said the distance of 49.97 kiloparsecs can be used to calibrate longer cosmic breadths			0
it could also improve the determination of the expansion rate of the universe - known as the @entity34 constant			1
it is named after astronomer @entity64 who stunned the world in 1929 by discovering our universe has been growing continuously since its inception			2
this artist 's impression shows an eclipsing binary star system			0
by studying how the light changes , and other properties of the system , astronomers can measure the distances to eclipsing binaries very accurately			2
a long series of observations of very rare cool eclipsing binaries has now led to the most accurate determination so far of the distance to the @entity7 , a neighbouring galaxy to the @entity13 and crucial step in the determination of distances across the @entity86			1
determining the @entity34 constant is critical for gauging the age and size of our universe , and the exact distance to the @entity7 is one of the largest uncertainties plaguing past measurements			2
dr @entity54 , of @entity96 in @entity97 , said they are confident they can improve further on the accuracy of their measurements			0
the researchers made their calculation by observing rare close pairs of stars - known as eclipsing binaries			0
the @entity109 stellar nursery in the @entity7 , which is our nearest neighbouring galaxy these pairs are gravitationally bound to each other and once per orbit - as seen from @entity16 - the total brightness from the system drops as each component eclipses its companion			2
by tracking these changes in brightness very carefully and also measuring the orbital speeds of the stars it 's possible to work out how big the stars are and other information about their orbits			0
when this is combined with careful measurements of the apparent brightness , remarkably accurate distances can be determined			0
the study used 16 years - worth of observations to identify a sample of stars with extremely long orbital periods - perfect for calculating precise distances			2
this new measurement can be used to decrease the uncertainty in calculations of the @entity34 constant to three per cent with prospects of improving this to a two per cent uncertainty in a few years			1
dr @entity54 said : ‘ in the era of precision cosmology it is essential to determine the @entity34 constant to an accuracy of three per cent or better			0
‘ the @entity7 distance we derive from these systems is accurate to 2.2 per cent and provides a firm base for a three per cent determination of the @entity34 constant with prospects for improvement to two per cent in the future			0

large @entity156 is 163,000 light years away from us
it is a dwarf galaxy and it floats in space around the @entity13
the measurement could help determine the scale of the universe
