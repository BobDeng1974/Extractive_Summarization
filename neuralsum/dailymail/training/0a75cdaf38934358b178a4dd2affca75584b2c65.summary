@entity0 has been taken to task by some psycho - babble fitness guru for failing to understand that @entity3 , at coming up to 20 , needs more rest between football games than stars just a few months older than he is			1
the @entity10 manager ’s only real mistake was sending on @entity11 as a second half substitute in @entity13 and thereby giving a cap to a player who had announced himself too tired to give his all for his country			1
@entity3 ( right ) told @entity10 boss @entity0 that he was too tired to start against @entity13 @entity0 started @entity3 ( second right ) on the bench for @entity10 's 1 - 0 @entity20 qualifying win in @entity13 if @entity3 was being that precious he ought not to have been granted an honour which should be deemed priceless			1
the trolling to which this young man has been subjected on the internet has been unpleasant , unnecessary and in some cases downright sick			2
however , he did need reminding that it is a privilege to pull on the @entity10 shirt and that great players do not pick and choose their international appearances			1
@entity3 ( centre ) came on as a second half substitute for @entity32 against @entity13 in @entity33 of the players @entity10 used against @entity13 , only @entity34 has played more minutes this season than @entity3 ... @entity34 1164 minutes played @entity3 1079 mins @entity37 1064 mins @entity32 1035 mins @entity38 995 mins @entity39 990 mins @entity40 990 mins @entity41 919 mins @entity42 836 mins @entity43 758 mins @entity44 741 mins @entity45 538 mins @entity46 , a surprisingly outspoken commentator after spending his distinguished playing career saying next to nothing , performed that service by confirming that he would never have failed to turn out for @entity10 unless he was really sick or injured			1
@entity51 ’s record talks louder than words			1
at the age of 17 he shook off the injurious effects of an arduous club season with @entity56 to lead @entity57 to 1958 @entity59 glory in @entity60 with six goals in four matches , including a hat - trick in the semi and a brace in the @entity66			1
he then collapsed with exhaustion at the final whistle but the effects of his exertions did not prevent him going on to score more than a thousand goals in a career overflowing with honours , including more @entity74			2
but then not even the greatest footballer of all time was pampered in those days			0
and it is difficult to resist the conclusion that it is the money which spoils today ’s young players			0
if our @entity82 princelings were not banking hundreds of thousands of pounds a week would any of them even consider pulling out of an @entity10 match ? @entity46 ( centre ) , training here in his @entity87 days , claimed rest days should be for older players @entity51 collapsed with exhaustion at the end of the 1958 @entity59 final after scoring a brace for @entity57 @entity51 , aged just 17 , scored six goals in four matches at the @entity59 following a gruelling season with @entity56 not , i would suggest , if they still needed international fame to cement their fortune			1
also - and never mind that it risks abuse from the ' twitterers ' for saying this – it is worth drawing to @entity106 ’s attention that younger men than he fight and die for this country			0
the war - zone is no place for feeling a mite too tired for action – and the rewards are nothing like as enormous			2
with @entity3 volunteering for @entity10 duty in the @entity120 - 21 @entity119 championships next year , it does seem he has got the message			1
so when @entity0 bumps into @entity122 at @entity123 this very sunday , i trust he will not be making any apologies			2
@entity126 ’s manager is never slow to make excuses for his players			2
@entity126 boss @entity122 ( left ) is set to meet @entity0 at @entity129 on sunday for the clash with @entity123 like so many , he puts the interests of his club first			1
he can hardly be blamed for doing so , especially in this case where there are unsettling suggestions that @entity11 may already be fidgeting for a move elsewhere			0
but that does not mean that @entity122 paints the full picture			0
@entity3 is a precocious talent and i for one will be disappointed if he does not develop into a vibrant force for both @entity126 and @entity10			1
yes , he may need nurturing to some extent – but not over-protecting			0
since @entity10 could pretty well qualify for @entity20 even if they failed to turn up for the rest of their group matches , there was no need to send him on in the second half last sunday			2
better to have sent him home to bed			0
@entity3 returned to @entity126 's @entity150 training ground on tuesday ahead of the @entity82 's return as @entity43 closes in on sir @entity154 ’s record of 49 @entity10 goals , there are many who would begrudge him usurping such a legend of the beautiful game			1
so it is worth putting on record that @entity161 is not one them			2
as a director of @entity87 , sir @entity154 is a frequent and inspirational visitor to the @entity165 dressing room and has struck up a warm relationship with @entity43			0
@entity43 closed in on sir @entity154 's scoring record of 49 @entity10 goals by netting against @entity13 @entity154 , pictured with @entity43 in 2010 , has struck up a warm relationship with the @entity87 striker 1 ) sir @entity154 - 49 goals ( 106 caps ) 2 ) @entity172 - 48 ( 80 caps ) ( @entity175 goals - 47 ) 3 ) @entity176 - 44 ( 57 caps ) 4 ) @entity43 - 43 ( 99 caps ) 5 ) @entity179 ( 89 caps ) 6 ) @entity181 - 30 ( 33 caps ) = 6 ) @entity183 - 30 ( 63 caps ) = 6 ) @entity185 - 30 ( 76 caps ) 9 ) @entity187 - 29 ( 23 caps ) = 9 ) @entity189 - 29 ( 106 caps ) sunday ’s penalty in @entity13 brought @entity43 to within six goals of that magic number and @entity161 will be applauding if he closes the gap still further when @entity10 meet @entity196 at @entity197 on november 15			1
and why not ? memory may insist that @entity176 and @entity172 – who are also in the throes of being overtaken - were sharper goalscorers but there should be no denying the magnitude of @entity43 ’s impending achievement			0
not that he should count those chickens yet			0
as @entity172 discovered when he missed the penalty from which he should have equalled @entity161 ’s record , there can be many a slip between opportunity and delivery			0
nor do statistics alone assert who is the greater			0
the circumstances in which those goals are scored brings its own perspective			0
not until his third tournament did @entity43 score his so - far solitary goal at the @entity59 finals – that mere consolation tap - in during defeat by @entity223 this summer			2
@entity176 and @entity172 are third and second respectively in the list of @entity10 's all - time goalscorers @entity43 celebrates after scoring his so - far solitary goal at a @entity59 - against @entity223 during the summer @entity154 shoots and scores against @entity227 in @entity10 's 2 - 1 semi-final victory at @entity197 in 1966 @entity161 celebrates and runs with arms upraised as @entity10 progressed to the 1966 @entity59 final @entity154 scored three in @entity10 ’s winning of the 1966 @entity59 , two of them against @entity227 in the semi-final			1
his @entity10 record is one of the longest - standing in world sport – at 44 years and five months , so far			1
given today ’s context of so many more matches against tiny football countries – some of which used to be but corners of the giant @entity244 against whom @entity154 played – @entity43 will have to score plenty more than 50 if his record and stature are to stand the test of him			0
but like sir @entity154 , we wish him well			0
@entity11 rest row rumbles on			0

@entity3 started @entity10 's @entity254 with @entity13 on the bench after *complaining* he was too tired
@entity0 's only mistake was putting @entity3 on as a substitute
if @entity126 *wideman* was so tired he should not have been given a cap
@entity51 , aged just 17 years old , collapsed with exhaustion as @entity57 won the @entity59 in 1958
