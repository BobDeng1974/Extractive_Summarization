when you feel blue , or something goes wrong , what do you do ? most would say put on a brave face or looking on the bright side is best			1
after all , what ’s the point in crying over spilt milk ? but a revolutionary new book says such a stiff upper lip could do you far more harm than good			1
in @entity14 , renowned @entity13 psychologist @entity12 makes the extraordinary claim that dwelling on our bad feelings is , in fact , the key to health and happiness			1
all by myself : even film character @entity23 ( pictured ) recognised the importance of a good wallow to recuperate after a heart - ache @entity12 discovered this method after seeking therapy for her own depression , and realising she had always held in negative feelings as her parents had discouraged her from crying as a child			1
it was only in accepting them , and allowing herself to feel her sadness and pain fully , that they finally started to dissipate and she began to recover			2
when she became a therapist , she started to encourage her clients to try such ‘ constructive wallowing ’ themselves , and noted how beneficial it was			0
dr @entity42 , a @entity44 - based consultant clinical psychologist , believes her method is convincing			1
she says : ‘ we @entity46 have a reputation for holding our emotions in			2
‘ as well as a fear of judgment — such as being seen as a “ hysterical woman ” — strong emotions can feel scary			1
but if we do n’t deal with them they will only rear their heads again , potentially leading to deep - seated psychological problems			2
’ of course , there ’s a difference between self - destructive moping — comfort eating , drowning your sorrows in alcohol or lashing out — and constructive wallowing			2
indeed , @entity12 says her step - by - step guide to wallowing constructively , without shame , could help you avoid this kind of destructive behaviour altogether			1
it could even be the key to happier relationships , more energy , greater confidence and even good health , as it can reduce the kind of chronic stress that leads to high blood pressure , a lowered immune system and loss of libido			1
here , in this exclusive adaptation , we show how constructive wallowing can help you safely beat bad feelings by allowing yourself to have them in the first place — leaving you happier than ever			1
this quick quiz will give you a sense of your relationship with your emotions — and how those feelings are influencing your life			1
give yourself a point for every statement you agree with , and half a point where you find yourself on the fence			2
once you ’ve done it , cut it out and keep it so once you ’ve tried constructive wallowing for a week or two , you can take the quiz again to see how your outlook has changed			0
how to wallow : try to set aside at least an hour and find a private place such as a bedroom or a bath			2
avoid alcohol , food and other distractions such as the radio or your phone score of 0 - 4 : you already have a great deal of self - compassion and allow yourself to wallow when you need to			0
score of 5 - 9 : you have some positive feelings about yourself but could enjoy the extra energy that constructive wallowing will bring			2
score of 10 - 14 : you ’re too self - critical			0
learning how and when to wallow will boost your self - esteem and improve your relationships			0
score of 15 + : you ’re probably exhausted from trying not to let your emotions show			2
wallowing could be life - changing for you			0
wallowing is like brushing your teeth ; it ’s a great thing to do , but not at a cocktail party			2
try to find a chunk of time between all your obligations , but remember if you ’re feeling stuck or emotional , the only constructive use of your time is to pay attention to your emotions , as they wo n’t let you go until you do			1
try to set aside at least an hour and find a private place such as a bedroom or a bath			2
avoid alcohol , food and other distractions such as the radio or your phone			0
spend as long as you need and take tissues with you			0
but a little bit of wallowing , even five minutes , is better than never wallowing at all : you can even do it while queuing , stuck in traffic or hoovering			0
constructive wallowing is a formal five - step process @entity12 has christened the truth technique			1
it ’s not a one - time fix , but a blueprint for a new way of living that you must constantly practice			2
before you begin , take at least ten breaths and let your body relax			0
go through each step as slowly as you need to , and stop when it feels natural — it could take a minute or an hour			0
let your emotions spill out and feel each one fully			1
for example , if a friend has let you down or you ’re upset about what someone has said to @entity166 what you ’re feeling			0
try to put words to what you ’re experiencing , for example : ‘ i feel humiliated , ’ or : ‘ i ’m dreading my sister ’s wedding			1
’ uncover self - criticism			0
often negative feelings like envy , dislike or disappointment make you feel like you ’re an envious , hateful , weak person — but you ’re not			1
good people feel angry , jealous and impatient , too			1
so root out impatience with yourself and do n’t think you ’re too sensitive			1
you ’re allowed to feel how you feel			0
look for reasons why a good person would feel this way			0
it ’s ok to want that promotion over someone else , even if they did deserve it			0
just sit with it , cry about it , talk to yourself about it , hug or punch a pillow — whatever you need to do			0
many people worry that if they allow themselves to fully experience their negative feelings , they might fall into a metaphorical black hole and never get out			1
others think it ’s a sign of weakness to mope and , of course , it can be painful to cry			0
but when we ignore feelings , they get stuck inside us and multiply			0
this , @entity12 explains , is known as the ‘ escalation cycle ’ , and it goes like this : when you have a bad feeling — anything from losing a friend to getting angry over a late train — you may suppress it because it seems inconvenient , too painful or too big			1
do despair : many people worry that if they allow themselves to fully experience their negative feelings , they might fall into a metaphorical black hole and never get out instead , you might turn to food , alcohol , shopping , sex or another activity that blanks out your true emotional state with temporary good feelings			1
or you might have trained yourself to ignore unpleasant feelings altogether			0
either way , feelings get stuffed inside , festering and piling up until one of two things happens			1
either they eventually explode in a form of destructive behaviour ( just think of how you can erupt into a temper over something seemingly minor after a day full of niggles ) , which gives some brief relief , but may well leave you feeling full of remorse			0
or , they are buried even deeper , which can eventually lead to chronic emotional and even physical pain , leading to breakdowns , anxiety or stress			1
constructive wallowing stops this cycle			0
it ’s much healthier to acknowledge each bad feeling so you can deal with it , get over it and move on			1
it sounds strange , encouraging you to do something which feels bad to make you feel better			1
but according to @entity12 , mentally crying ‘ ouch ! ’ when life hurts you will make you feel more peaceful and less anxious			1
contrary to conventional wisdom , wallowing over something that happened months or years ago is good if it ’s bothering you now			0
while nothing can change the past , it does n’t mean you ’re not allowed to have feelings about it			2
you ’re not hanging on to the bad things — it ’s the other way round : your feelings still have hold of you			1
in order to help those memories disappear , you have to deal with them properly			0
remember , feelings are not values			0
if you feel indignant about something , it ’s not because you ’re an indignant person — you ’re just indignant about a particular thing			2
tackle your hang - ups : contrary to conventional wisdom , wallowing over something that happened months or years ago is good if it 's bothering you now do n’t make a moral judgment out of having an unpleasant feeling			2
only judge yourself by your actions			0
we often forget that having an emotion is not the same as acting on it : feeling angry is not the same as swearing			0
we can feel one way and act another			0
this means we should n’t keep a stranglehold on negative emotions			1
allowing yourself to experience them without judgment is at the centre of constructive wallowing and , says @entity12 , one of the most liberating things you can do			1
wallowing does not mean holding on to anger			0
forgiveness and moving on comes naturally after a period of constructive wallowing , when you have allowed yourself to experience bad feelings , and then let them go			1
it ’s not necessary to make yourself feel forgiveness towards someone who ’s hurt you , it happens naturally			1
in the same way , if you ’re worried about opening the floodgates of your emotions and not being able to stop crying once you ’ve started , trust that wallowing has a natural end			2
just make sure you give yourself enough time when you sit down to do it			0
you ’ll be amazed by the difference it will make to your life .			0

' @entity313 ' is a new theory on coping with unhappiness
says dwelling on our bad feelings is key to health and happiness
new method is *pioneered* by @entity13 psychologist @entity12
when bad things happen , i try to look on the bright side ;
i ’d rather not see friends when i ’m *unhappy* ;
there ’s no sense in crying over spilt milk ;
i hate it when i get emotional over small things ;
dwelling on negative feelings just makes them worse ;
i like to lead with my head , not my heart ;
anger is a toxic emotion ;
sometimes , i find my own feelings *ridiculous* ;
it ’s not healthy to dwell ;
i get annoyed when i ca n’t snap out of a blue mood ;
when i ’m down , i think of the things i ’m *grateful* for ;
i should n’t complain as other people have it worse than me ;
it ’s best not to think about things that make you upset ;
i often do n’t understand my own feelings ;
i can be hard on myself ;
l ’m not comfortable with anger ;
i ’m not comfortable with tears ;
i can be very overly sensitive ;
i feel anxious or depressed *fairly* often ;
i should be able to control my emotions .
