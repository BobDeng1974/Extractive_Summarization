by @entity0 published : 10:59 est , 31 january 2013 updated : 11:23 est , 1 february 2013 forward - thinking architects have come up with a new way to solve the @entity5 's chronic housing shortage - converting garages into tiny homes			1
a row of out - of - use lock - ups on a council estate are due to be turned into cosy bedsits for young professionals and people unable to find a home			1
tenants will have to pay just £ 11 a week for the mini houses , which are set to cost around £ 13,000 to convert			2
community : an architecture firm plans to convert disused garages into a row of miniature homes the designs were inspired by a row of garages which have been standing unused on the @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26			1
architecture firm @entity27 has proposed to set up its ' pop - up ' homes in spaces like the garages which are awaiting permanent redevelopment			2
each home will measure 11.5 square metres , and contain a bed , kitchen and bathroom , with room for a small table and two chairs			0
every fifth garage is set to be turned into a communal area , with a laundry , extra kitchen equipment and a dining space			0
innovative : @entity27 hopes the unusual move will help alleviate the @entity5 's housing crisis plans : these artist 's impressions show how the 11.5 square metre homes will look the homes will be built off - site and assembled by apprentices - and if the site is redeveloped , existing units can be dismantled and used elsewhere			1
the project is known as pop - up @entity57 through @entity59			0
it was the winner of a housing design competition organised by the @entity62 , a charity which aims to encourage sustainable architecture in deprived areas			2
if it is successful , the scheme will be expanded to other parts of @entity26 and throughout the @entity5 , concentrating on areas where there are lots of homeless people or a shortage of housing for the young			1
the architects are already in talks with a number of local authorities in hope of launching similar schemes			0
blueprint : detailed instructions show how the homes can be assembles without much difficulty @entity84 , one of the architects who designed the project , said : ' the proposal targets under - used spaces in high density areas where land value is high and rising			2
' we believe it offers a creative and practical interim solution between other development opportunities and we 're really excited about the potential to develop the scheme with @entity62 and our partners			0
' ' the proposals not only offer a home but education opportunities in construction techniques , ' said @entity102 from @entity27			0
' it is a way of regenerating street frontage and a practical interim solution between other development possibilities			0
' now : the garages are currently standing unused on the @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 however , some experts have criticised the proposal for seeking to pack residents into the smallest spaces possible			1
architect @entity112 said : ' personally , i think " pop - up " housing is morally bankrupt			1
' any architect who is serious about homelessness should be addressing the causes of the problem , rather than using developer - speak consistent with the commercial forces making housing unaffordable for so many			1
' there is political capital in presenting this as temporary solution to underused land , as much as to homelessness but the houses are pretty much caravans			0
