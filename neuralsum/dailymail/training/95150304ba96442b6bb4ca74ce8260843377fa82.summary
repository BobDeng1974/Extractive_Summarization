a homeless charity has warned of a ' crisis ' after figures revealed the number of new homes being built is at its lowest level since records began			1
the number of new homes built in @entity9 has dropped by 6 % on the previous year , government figures have showed			1
just 121,200 new homes were built in @entity11 which means this year will see the fewest homes built since 1923			1
worrying decline : the number of new homes being built in @entity11 this year is at its lowest level since 1923 @entity15 , @entity16 's chief executive , said : ' these figures will be a huge disappointment for millions of people up and down the country			1
' decades of failure to build enough homes has n't just resulted in sky - high house prices , but is also responsible for an increasingly expensive rental market , with recent shelter research revealing average private rents are now unaffordable for ordinary working families in over half of local authorities in @entity11			1
work to do : housing minister @entity30 said the government is taking ' radical action ' to address @entity11 's housing need ' in this country every two minutes someone faces the nightmare of losing their home as more and more people struggle to keep up with their rent or mortgage			1
' we are now at crisis point and the upcoming @entity45 must step forward with a long - term vision to build more homes to tackle our escalating housing crisis			1
' this years figures represent a 6 per cent decrease on the 128,680 new homes built in the previous year , and compares with a steeper 23 per cent fall the year before that , the @entity49 said			1
@entity54 saw the biggest decrease of new homes , with a 27 per cent fall on the previous year to reach 17,830 in the latest figures			1
the @entity58 saw the biggest supply increase at 26 per cent , reaching a figure of 4,710 more homes in 2010/11			1
after tailing off slightly between 2000 and 2002 , housing supply increased for six years in a row , peaking at 207,370 additional homes in 2007/08			1
the overall fall in the latest figures was due to 6,500 fewer new - build completions , 1,180 fewer conversions , and 2,060 fewer extra dwellings resulting from changes of use			2
the figures were offset by an increase of other types of accommodation , such as mobile homes and temporary dwellings , which rose by 840			1
fewer homes were also knocked down , with a fall in demolitions of 1,440 on the previous year			1
@entity80 , @entity81 director of economic affairs , said : ' the figures are very concerning at a time when we already have an acute housing shortage			2
' @entity31 needs to work with the industry and lenders to address lack of mortgage availability			2
' it must also end the ongoing vacuum in planning policy and implement a planning system that delivers enough land to build the homes the country desperately needs			2
' the annual report shows the supply of housing in @entity11 by measuring the absolute change in dwelling stock , including the number of completed new house builds and gains or losses through conversions and changes of use , minus demolitions			1
the latest new homes figure includes 117,700 new - build homes , 5,050 additional homes resulting from conversions , 11,540 extra homes resulting from a change of use , as well as 1,810 other gains and a loss of 14,890 homes through demolitions			2
housing minister @entity30 said : ' today 's figures clearly show that we are still living with the legacy of a draconian system of top - down targets that pitted communities against developers			1
' we 're already taking radical action to turn the tide , and will shortly publish a @entity45 outlining both the measures we 're already taking and some new moves we 'll make to get @entity131 building again			1
' these include scrapping targets and instead ensuring that , for the first time , local people see the benefits of growth in their area through the @entity139 , which matches the council tax raised on new properties for six years			0
' it also includes our @entity144 programme , which is set to exceed original expectations and deliver up to 170,000 homes , on top of the 100,000 we want to help get built by making public land available to developers			2
' the construction sector enjoyed a surprise expansion in october but economists today warned of more challenges ahead as confidence hit a three - year low			2
the growth was driven by a surge in new orders from businesses , with civil engineering broadly stagnant and housebuilding in decline for the fifth month in a row			0
but confidence dropped to its lowest level since december 2008 - when the @entity131 was in the depths of the recession - amid @entity31 cutbacks and uncertainties about the strength of private sector demand			2
a closely watched @entity173 / @entity172 survey , in which a reading above 50 represents expansion , hit a five - month high of 53.9 , up from 50.1 in september			0
economists had expected it to flatline at around 50 , which marks no growth			0
the figures , although improved , will not significantly allay fears that the @entity131 economy will contract in the final quarter of 2011 , after woeful manufacturing figures released yesterday			0
@entity172 chief executive @entity186 said the survey indicated that the sector had accelerated ' at some pace after a broad stagnation in september ' but was ' nothing to get excited about '			0
he added : ' due to current economic conditions , it may be some time yet before we start seeing the sustained growth the sector really needs			0
' across the sector as a whole , confidence about future business activity plunged to its lowest in almost three years , with optimism fading as constructors come to recognise that there are more challenges yet to come			0
' official figures released yesterday revealed the @entity131 's gdp increased by a better - than - expected 0.5 % between july and september , up from the 0.1 % rise in the previous quarter			0
but these were overshadowed by a @entity173 / @entity172 survey that showed the manufacturing sector contracted at the fastest rate since mid- 2009 in october			0
today 's survey showed the construction sector continued to recruit more staff in october , although at a slower rate than before			0
inflation on goods rose markedly in october , having hit a 10 - month low in september			0
it was driven upwards by the rising cost of fuel and raw materials			0
@entity222 , chief economist at @entity223 , said the sector is ' far from racing ahead and it clearly faces an extremely challenging environment ' as the government cuts spending on schools , hospitals and infrastructure			0
he added that housebuilding activity will continue to be constrained amid soft prices and ' a worrisome outlook '			0
he said : ' while the pick - up in activity in october is to be welcomed , it does not hugely dilute fears that the economy could contract in the fourth quarter			0
' worries over the state of the @entity131 's economy will be heightened tomorrow if a survey for the powerhouse services sector , which accounts for three - quarters of the economy , shows a weaker performance .			0
