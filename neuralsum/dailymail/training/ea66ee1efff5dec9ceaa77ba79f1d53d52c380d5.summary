a green sea turtle was today enjoying a new lease of life thanks to the world 's first dive belt built exclusively for endangered sea creatures			0
@entity6 has managed to dive properly for the first time in 11 years , since she was hit by a boat which left an air bubble under her shell , stopping her from submerging and causing her to float bottom up			1
the metre - long turtle , who weighs more than 10 stone , had found herself stranded on the surface			0
suited up : a team at @entity21 in @entity22 have created a pioneering belt with 2.5lbs of removable lead weights that works just like those used by scuba divers help : @entity6 's giant shell was split open by an engine propeller and she was left for dead after being hit by a boat in her native @entity31 in @entity32			1
now a team at @entity21 in @entity22 have created a pioneering belt with 2.5lbs of removable lead weights that works just like those used by scuba divers			1
the new invention is believed to be the first of its kind - and means @entity6 , named after boxer @entity6 , can dive again			2
@entity41 , curator at the @entity42 , said : ‘ the common thing to do is to stick weights to injured turtles ' shells to allow them to dive			0
' but where @entity6 's shell was in slightly worse condition because of her accident it was n't that easy			1
‘ my team and i started thinking about how else we could attach the weights , and came up with the idea of a harness			2
‘ we took the idea to a nearby dive shop and they came back to us with a custom - built dive belt we could slip weights into			2
it needs a few tweaks but otherwise it is ideal			0
special project : the new invention is believed to be the first of its kind - and means @entity6 can dive again ready to go : a protected endangered species , green turtles breathe oxygen but spend most of their lives under the water feeding and sleeping ‘ it will take a little time for @entity6 to get used to wearing her new jacket but eventually we see her wearing it all the time			2
poor @entity6 used to float like a butterfly and swim like a bee			1
' this new invention will make life so much better for her			0
if the belt is successful it could pave the way for the other turtles ' @entity41 , @entity21 ‘ but this new invention will make life so much better for her			0
if the belt is successful it could pave the way for the other turtles			0
’ @entity6 's giant shell was split open by an engine propeller and she was left for dead after being hit by a boat in her native @entity31 in @entity32			1
luckily she was rescued and nursed back to health at a special hospital for turtles - but when her injuries eventually healed an air pocket was left under the shell giving her unwanted buoyancy			1
she 's back : @entity6 has managed to dive properly for the first time since 2001 , when she was hit by a boat which left an air bubble under her shell , stopping her from submerging and causing her to float bottom up thought to be 15 to 20 years old , @entity6 was one of five hospitalised green turtles transferred to @entity21 to ease numbers			1
all five had weights glued to their shells to help them dive but her shell was so badly damaged the weights would n't stick , prompting work to start on the special belt			1
a protected endangered species , green turtles breathe oxygen but spend most of their lives under the water feeding and sleeping			0
they can dive for up to five minutes and sleep underwater for more than an hour			0
in the wild , green turtles – known as chelonia mydas - can live for more than 80 years .			0
