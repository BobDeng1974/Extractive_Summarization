@entity60 led three of those earlier operations when he previously worked at the @entity67 , including the only above - elbow transplant that had been done at the time , in 2010			1

hero : @entity93 greets @entity8 after winning on the 18th green in the final round of the @entity97 golf tournament at @entity98 in @entity99 , @entity100 , july 5 , 2009 @entity8 pictured around 10 - months after he was injured in a roadside explosion in @entity5 - clearly visible is the scar running along his carotid artery it was on @entity105 of 2009 in @entity5 that @entity8 lost all four of his limbs when his vehicle ran over a roadside bomb			1
' it just took both arms , my left leg off completely and my right leg was still attached a little bit , ' @entity8 said to @entity115 , ' and killed my gunner - my best friend			1
' ' i severed my carotid artery , ' @entity8 said			1
' that alone should have killed me			0
' indeed , the cruel irony of the gruesome incident meant that @entity8 did not bleed to death within minutes because the heat of the blast cauterized the same wounds it had caused			2

' i was n't expected to live , ' @entity8 recalled			2
' i died three times and came back			0

@entity8 is greeted by ( @entity149 ) @entity148 right fielder @entity150 , center fielder @entity151 , first baseman @entity152 and @entity147 @entity8 relaxes on duty in @entity5 before his devastating accident in april 2009 minimizing anti-rejection drugs is important because they have side effects and raise the risk of cancer over the long term			1
those risks have limited the willingness of surgeons and patients to do more hand , arm and even face transplants			0
unlike a life - saving heart or liver transplant , limb transplants are aimed at improving quality of life , not extending it			2
quality of life is a key concern for people missing arms and hands - prosthetics for those limbs are not as advanced as those for feet and legs			2
