police have raced to the home of hate preacher @entity3 and evacuated his family to protect them from attack , it emerged today			1
officers helped them flee their @entity9 terraced house after threats from people wanting vengeance for the @entity14 murder of @entity15			1
@entity3 , who believes that ' war monger ' @entity17 's ' crusade ' in @entity19 is turning young @entity21 @entity20 to terrorism , allowed his wife and children to be rushed to a car and whisked away to a secret location at around 2pm yesterday			1
help : critics say the police should stop @entity3 's hate - filled speeches on the internet , rather than running up costs protecting his family from threats following the @entity14 terror evacuation : a member of @entity3 's family carries two pink bags before the children are ushered out as police shut the property 's door baby : a woman , believed to be @entity3 's wife , is escorted from the house by a female police officer , while carrying a young child two @entity49 officers then stood guard at the property for several hours afterwards			1
@entity3 himself was not at home , with a neighbour saying he had left the property earlier that morning			2
@entity49 today refused to discuss the operation , but it is understood that it was linked to a threat of violence			2
a group called @entity60 posted a video message online calling on police to arrest @entity3 by 6pm or they would come to detain him themselves			1
members also claimed they knew where he lived and security sources confirmed they decision to move his wife and children was because of safety fears			1
@entity3 today blamed @entity17 for a ' crusade ' against @entity73 which is turning young @entity21 @entity20 into potential terrorists			1
aggressive foreign policy in @entity19 and oppressive tactics employed by police and security organisations in @entity21 are responsible for isolating @entity21 @entity20 and leading them to adopt the extreme ideology that results in violent attacks , according to @entity3 , who admitted knowing @entity81 who butchered soldier @entity15 in @entity14 last week			1
' by ignoring the link between what took place in @entity14 , by blaming @entity20 , by trying to silence voices who oppose him and by justifying his rotten foreign policy , @entity17 has foolishly and inadvertently become the biggest radicalising tool for @entity20 youth both in the @entity21 and abroad , ' he said			0
' for the war monger @entity17 and his lackeys to suggest that no one can make such a link is not only complete rubbish but also highly irresponsible			0
' after all the @entity21 regime is supposedly charged with the security of the @entity21 people as opposed to being charged with engaging in some sort of @entity101 against @entity73 and @entity20 on the behest of the @entity104 regime around the world			0
' rally : @entity81 ( circled ) pictured at a demonstration in @entity108 , @entity9 , in 2007 with @entity3 suspects : @entity110 are investigating links between the two @entity14 murder suspects @entity81 ( left ) and @entity113 ( right ) and controversial preacher @entity3 yesterday @entity3 backtracked on comments he previously made about his links with one of drummer @entity15 's suspected killers in the face of an @entity110 investigation			2
@entity3 said he has not been in touch with murder suspect @entity81 since ' before 2007 ' after it was revealed @entity110 investigators were looking into the amount of contact , if any , he had with the two suspects			2
but last week @entity3 said he last saw him in 2011 and described him as a man of ' impeccable character ' in interviews with @entity130 and @entity131			2
refusing to condemn the killers of @entity15 , the @entity21 drummer crushed by a vehicle and then hacked to death with machetes , @entity3 even suggested that ‘ one man killed in a street ’ was hardly proper vengeance for those killed by ‘ @entity21 and the @entity104 ' in wars overseas			0
on @entity142 , @entity3 said : ' i can challenge the war monger @entity17 to an open debate on ' whether @entity20 should promote hatred or love against @entity21 foreign policy ? ' ' in reality @entity17 is clearly not able give any cogent argument as to why the @entity21 regime continues to follow the @entity104 in killing @entity20 ! ' meanwhile @entity113 has arrived at court for the first time since being charged with the murder of drummer @entity15 who was hacked to death outside his army barracks in @entity14 last week			0
fallen hero : father @entity15 , 25 , from @entity159 , was described as ' cheeky and humorous ' in tributes			0
he was executed by two suspected @entity73 terrorists in @entity14 last week accused : @entity113 arrives at @entity162 yesterday in the back of a police van after being charged with the murder of soldier @entity15 @entity113 , 22 , from @entity165 , was driven in the back of a police van to @entity162 , where he also faces a charge of possessing a firearm			0
he is due to appear before magistrates this morning detectives from the @entity173 's @entity172 said last night they had been authorised by the @entity174 ( @entity174 ) to charge him over last wednesday 's attack			0
his alleged accomplice , @entity81 , 28 , remains in a stable condition in hospital under armed guard , after being shot by police .			0

officers took away his wife and children to safe house after alleged threat
far - right groups demand he is arrested or they will detain him themselves
