by @entity0 published : 06:52 est , 27 march 2012 updated : 07:41 est , 27 march 2012 the @entity2 was the world 's fifth most prolific executioner and only western democracy to put a prisoner to death last year , new figures have revealed			1
forty three convicts died for their crimes in @entity2 in 2011 , ranking the world 's richest country fifth on the global execution league table			1
the figures , released by @entity14 , came as the rights group announced that 18,750 people are currently languishing on death row around the world			2
penalty : most executions in the @entity2 are carried out by lethal injection , in death chambers like this one capital punishment has become a polemical issue in the @entity2 in recent years			1
@entity28 - race flop @entity25 , who has signed the death warrants of 234 convicts in 10 years as @entity32 governor , was cheered at a @entity34 debate when he called it the ' ultimate justice '			1
most recent : @entity37 of the @entity37 crime speaks in the @entity40 prison in @entity41 , @entity32 , two weeks before his execution on february 29 @entity32 accounted for 30 per cent of all executions in @entity2 with 13 people put to death in 2011			1
the most recent was @entity37 , though he is not included in the figures as he was put to death on february 29 this year			2
@entity32 ( 13 ) 2			2
@entity49 ( 6 ) 3			2
@entity50 ( 5 ) 4			2
@entity51 ( 4 ) = 4			0
@entity52 ( 4 ) 6			0
@entity53 ( 2 ) = 6			0

@entity56 ( 1 ) = 9			0
@entity57 ( 1 ) = 9			0
@entity58 ( 1 ) = 9			0
@entity59 ( 1 ) = 9			0
@entity60 ( 1 ) the 41 - year - old , leader of the notorious ‘ @entity37 ’ , was killed by lethal injection for gunning down police officer @entity37 during a violent raid on a sports store on christmas eve 2010			2
but there are signs that @entity2 is edging away from the death penalty			1
last year , @entity69 became the 16th state to abolish the practice , and a moratorium was announced in @entity73			1
while @entity14 said @entity75 and @entity76 are close to abolition , 36 states still retain the death penalty			0
globally , there were more executions last year than in 2010			1
a surge in @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 is the cause of the rise , @entity14 said			2
' @entity88 , executive director of @entity89 , said : ' we do not believe that governments should be in the business of executing citizens			0
' that 's an inappropriate role for the government to play , regardless of the circumstances			0
' various countries subject a wide array of crimes to capital punishment			0
in @entity82 , death can be the punishment for adultery , sodomy and religious offenses such as apostasy or ' treason against @entity108 '			0
to death : a convicted murderer in @entity82 awaits his execution			0
@entity82 's most usual form of execution is hanging meanwhile , blasphemy in @entity116 , ' sorcery ' in @entity84 , trafficking in human bones in the @entity118 , and economic crimes in @entity120 such as selling fake drugs or tainted foods or soliciting deceptive organ transplantation carry the death penalty			1
@entity120 executes thousands of people annually , many more than the rest of the world put together			1
but figures are a state secret , @entity14 said , and it has stopped compiling them from public sources because those numbers lead to under - reporting and a gross underestimate of the true total			2
@entity120 ( ~ 1,000s ) 2			1
@entity82 ( 360 ) 3			0
@entity84 ( 82 ) 4			0
@entity83 ( 68 ) 5			0
@entity2 ( 43 ) 6			1
@entity85 ( 41 ) 7			0
@entity135 ( 30 ) 8			0
@entity136 ( 10 ) 9			0
@entity137 ( 7 + ) 10			0
@entity138 ( 5 + ) @entity14 challenged @entity140 to publish figures on sentencing and executions ' to confirm their claims that various changes in law and practice have led to a significant reduction in the use of the death penalty over the last four years , ' the group said			1
the wave of executions in the @entity153 - a 50 per cent regional increase - pushed the global total higher for 2011 , with 149 executions more worldwide than in 2010			1
@entity82 executed at least 360 people , many of them under harsh new anti-drug laws introduced last year			1
@entity82 executions are usually conducted by hanging , sometimes in public from a construction crane , which @entity14 said led the @entity161 construction equipment company @entity162 to cut off exports of cranes to @entity82 last july			1
@entity83 executed 68 people while @entity167 's former foreign minister and deputy prime minister , @entity169 , awaits his execution this year			1
@entity84 executed at least 82 ; and @entity85 executed at least 41			2
@entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 accounted for 99 percent of the executions in the @entity153 and @entity171 , @entity14 said			1
although all the @entity153 and @entity171 nations had very different governments and political dynamics , the 50 per cent increase in executions came against the backdrop of the @entity179 protests and upheaval			1
chaos in @entity182 meant that @entity14 was unable to account for any legal executions , though torture , detention and summary killings by pro-government loyalists and by opposition militias who ousted @entity191 's regime are widely reported			2
@entity191 himself appears to have been videotaped being shot to death by members of a crowd that apprehended him			0
@entity14 recorded no executions by stoning anywhere in the world in 2011			1
the rights group criticized @entity82 , @entity135 , @entity84 and @entity136 for staging public executions			2
@entity161 , which also retains capital punishment , recorded no executions for the first time in 19 years , @entity14 reported			1
@entity207 also conducted no executions for the seventh year in a row and @entity116 none for a third year , @entity14 said			1
@entity211 also had no executions in 2011 , but 362 people were on death row			1
@entity211 has sought to hire a hangman and received several applications for the job , @entity14 quoted @entity211 's @entity219 department as reporting .			0

@entity2 executed 43 prisoners in 2011
at least *676* recorded executions worldwide in 2011 ( compared to *527* the previous year )
steep rise in recorded executions in @entity153 blamed for global rise
@entity120 rank top with 1,000s but state secrecy means know way of *knowing* exact figure
@entity161 executed no prisoners for first time in 19 years
no executions by stoning recorded anywhere
