targeting the ' hunger ' nerve may help obese people lose weight , according to scientists			0
researchers from the @entity6 have created a new device which uses electrodes to block the vagus nerve from communicating the feelings of hunger to the brain			1
their aim was to develop a new treatment for obesity , as effective as bariatric surgery , but less invasive and without the risks			0
researchers found that blocking the vagus nerve - which communicates feelings of hunger - did lead to weight loss in a study of obese people , but was n't as effective as hoped the vagus nerve runs the length of a person 's torso , from the brain to the abdomen and tells the body when it is full			1
but in obese people , studies have shown that the vagus nerve becomes desensitised , causing them to overeat			0
the @entity35 researchers took 239 severely obese participants whose body mass index ’s ( @entity38 ) were between 35 and 45 , and who had one or more obesity - related condition			1
they implanted the device , blocking the vagus nerve in 162 of the participants			2
the other 77 participants had a ‘ sham ’ device implanted , which was inactive and did not block the vagus nerve			1
they were used as the control group			0
both groups underwent a course on weight management			0
the vagus nerve runs from the brain to the abdomen and regulates hunger by telling the body when it is full the study , published in the @entity59 , found that the device blocking the vagus nerve was mildly effective in reducing weight over the short term			1
after 12 months , those with the device fitted lost an average of 24 per cent of their excess weight , while those in the control group without the device fitted lost only 16 per cent			1
looking specifically at the group with the device fitted , researchers found 52 per cent of these participants lost a fifth of their excess weight , while 38 per cent lost at least a quarter of their excess weight			2
therefore though there was certainly weight loss , the procedure fell short of being as effective as the researchers had hoped			2
the study concluded : ‘ additional studies are needed to compare effectiveness of vagal nerve block with other obesity treatments and to assess long ­ term durability of weight loss and safety			0

@entity6 researchers developed a device which used electrodes to block the vagus nerve from communicating feelings of hunger
@entity98 nerve tells the body when it is full , and can causes overeating if it becomes *de-sensitised*
researchers took 239 participants with @entity38 's of between 35 and *46* and one or more obesity related condition
some participants were fitted with an active device , some were fitted with an inactive ' sham ' device
after 12 months , those with the device lost more weight , but the procedure was not as effective as researchers had hoped
