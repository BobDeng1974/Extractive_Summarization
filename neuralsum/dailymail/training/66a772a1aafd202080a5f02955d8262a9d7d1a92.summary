by @entity0 published : 16:22 est , 8 march 2013 updated : 16:25 est , 8 march 2013 conservationists scored a major victory over the wind farm lobby yesterday after plans to build giant turbines near one of the nation ’s finest surviving @entity8 gardens were halted			1
a high court judge ruled preserving historic settings was of greater importance than renewable energy targets			1
mrs @entity14 said the bid to build four 430ft high turbines on farmland owned by the @entity19 ’s cousin the @entity20 was legally flawed			1
how the wind farm may have looked ...			2
she ruled the planning inspector had failed to ‘ accord ‘ special weight ’ or considerable importance to ‘ the desirability of preserving the setting ’ , and said the case must now be reconsidered in light of her judgement			0
the case , which was brought by the @entity33 and @entity34 , alongside @entity35 , was hailed as a significant victory by conservationists , who had warned approval would undermine protection of other historic sites			1
the giant turbines at @entity43 , would have overshadowed the historic gardens at @entity45 in @entity46			2
it is described as one of @entity50 ’s oldest garden landscapes and features an unfinished 17th - century tudor garden lodge , ‘ steeped in @entity53 symbolism ’			0
@entity33 director of conservation @entity54 , said : ‘ of course we are pleased			1
@entity33 ’s mission is to preserve what is very special to so many people			1
it is a huge judgement in favour of conserving of our historic landscapes			2
’ the charity is currently opposing or monitoring around 25 applications for wind farms due to concerns over their impact on the surrounding countryside or heritage sites			0
out the window : prince @entity71 , the @entity20 , will now not have a wind farm built on his land mr @entity54 said yesterday ’s ruling would strengthen the @entity33 ’s hand when it came to future opposition			1
‘ it sends an important signal that area of outstanding beauty or national significance need protecting and are unsuitable for these types of developments , ’ he said			0
‘ although it is not a legal precedent , this can only help in the context of preservation			0
’ earlier this week , the @entity33 ’s chairman sir @entity89 said communities were complaining on an almost daily basis of a wind farm or housing development proposed in a sensitive @entity94 said that far from stimulating the economy , the reforms ‘ will produce not more housing , but more conflict ’ and spark ‘ warfare ’ in @entity101 ’s countryside			1
plans for the @entity43 wind farm were rejected by the district council in the first instance in 2010 , after strong local opposition			1
but the developers appealed and in march last year public inquiry inspector @entity108 allowed its construction			0
the inspector said he recognised the case had wide implications for listed buildings and conservation areas , but said the government ’s green targets - to produce 15 per cent of energy from renewable sources by 2020 - must come first			2
yesterday , mrs justice @entity14 ruled the inspector had failed to ‘ properly interpret and apply the relevant planning policies on the effect of development on the setting of heritage sites ’ and quashed the decision			0
she said the planning inspector was wrong to treat the ‘ ” harm ” to the setting and the wider benefit of the wind farm proposal as if those two factors were of equal importance			0
’ reacting to the ruling , @entity34 chief executive @entity136 said : ‘ we are very pleased with the judgment			0
we brought our joint challenge because we felt the planning inspector ’s decision did not strike a proper balance between the conservation of outstandingly important historic sites and wind energy			2
‘ the effect of the proposed turbines on one of the most important , beautiful and unspoilt @entity8 landscapes in @entity50 would be appalling			0
’ no go : plans to build a wind farm on @entity43 , owned by the @entity20 , have been thrown out but @entity154 , deputy chief executive @entity155 , which represents the wind farm industry , said : ‘ it would be wrong to suggest that any kind of precedent has been set on this occasion , as each wind farm application is considered on a case - by - case basis			1
‘ the fact that this application went to the @entity166 shows that , at times , decisions are finely balanced and difficult to reach			0

plans to build ' energy farm ' on land owned by the @entity20 thrown out
@entity33 and @entity174 delighted with the ' victory ' to *safeguard* historic site
