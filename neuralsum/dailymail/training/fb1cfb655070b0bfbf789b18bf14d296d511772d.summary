it was the moment when the oldest female hostage , being held inside the @entity3 chocolate cafe for hours by a crazed gunman , had enough and confronted her captor because ' no one else had '			1
mother and daughter were part of the @entity11 's television special on sunday , recounting the ordeals of eight survivors : @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
when quizzed about her confrontation with @entity24 , @entity21 , 72 , told @entity25 on the @entity11 's siege special ' i just thought no - one else had ( stood up to him ) and i thought , well , i will have a go '			1
' i just wanted to let him know that i was n't impressed with what he was choosing to do with all of our lives			1
mother and daughter were trapped inside the @entity3 cafe by gunman man @entity37 with 16 other hostages last december heavily armed @entity40 police storm the building after @entity24 shot @entity42 @entity20 suffered foot injuries in the climax to the @entity46 siege on december 16 throughout their ordeal , the pair knew they would be unable to escape his clutches , with @entity20 confined to the use of a walking stick			1
i 'm not exactly able to run and my mother is elderly , so you know , reality , our reality was was that we really did have to wait for the police to come , ' she said on the @entity64 program			2
the 72 - year - old said to him : ' i just do n't like your attitude			1
it 's not an attitude of how we run			1
we do n't need this			1
we come in here for refreshments			2
' the hostage - taker then turned to @entity20 and said : ' @entity20 , keep your mother quiet			1
' when quizzed about her confrontation with @entity24 , @entity21 , 72 , told @entity25 on the @entity11 's siege special ' i just thought no - one else had ( stood up to him ) and i thought , well , i will have a go '			1
she was trapped with her daughter @entity20 , who has ms one of the last images of @entity88 siege gunman man @entity37 , seen inside the @entity3 cafe but she would not and was determined to be heard by @entity24			1
' i want to go to the bathroom and my daughter needs her medication , ' she told him and for a moment , he seemed to relent , offering to allow @entity20 to take her medication			1
but then his mood shifts again and he focuses on the barrister @entity96 , who he came to refer to as ' white shirt '			2
@entity20 recalls how her mother stood up to the crazed gunman survivors of the @entity88 siege told their story to 60 minutes in a two - hour special on sunday ' you , white shirt man , no talking , ' he demanded			1
a short time later mr @entity96 would follow @entity106 out the door , the first two taken hostage , to escape			2
@entity111 and @entity96 were the first hostages to escape the clutches of @entity24 but there would be no escape for the mother and daughter			1
they were left inside , sitting with @entity42			1
as the last group ran , @entity20 remembers : ' i heard a bang and i looked up and i opened my eyes and they were all gone			1
now , in the moment , in that moment , i assumed that the police had come			0
i did n't realise that they had escaped			1
then , i saw the door and i went it 's time to go			0
' but she could n't			1
' i stood up from my chair and went forward , ' she said			1
' but at the same time , went but mum 's not coming and @entity42 , why are they not moving ? in that moment , i went i ca n't go			1
' you know , i ca n't go			1
i ca n't leave mum here			1
so what am i going to do ? so i just laid down on the floor			0
i laid down face first and put my hands above my head , on the floor , and waited			0
' she had seen @entity138 and @entity16 lead the group of six out			0
' oh yes , and i also tried to encourage @entity42 to go			0
he is seated directly beside me			0
' @entity20 could n't explain why she and @entity42 did n't try to get out			1
' well , it was all so quick , you know , ' she said			0
' look , truly , unless you are in the room , the experience of the quickness of the end was unreal			0
' he came out and he was leaning over me and shouting " why are you there ? why are you there ? " and he grabbed me then by the - by my back , by my bra strap and hauled me up and i 'm trying to get up and i 'm saying " i 'm trying			1
' he drags me over to the middle of the room and says " you stand here			0
you stand here " and then " no , no , you sit here			0
" ' then he calls me			0
he calls " you " and indicates to mum			0
and he 's hyper by this stage and he is anxious and , you know , alert and , you know , he has got his gun and he you know , he has got his gun and he - he is directing us and pushing us and , you know , you here			2
@entity46 manager @entity42 seen here at the open of the store in 2013 was one of two hostages killed in the @entity175 siege on december 16 ' and you to this side and me to the other side and he is spinning			2
and the back pack that he 's wearing that supposedly had the bomb in it is moving and knocking me and probably knocking mum as well			0
and so it is all kind of go , go , go			0
and then , he says to @entity42 , he says " you " and he calls him over and says - says " @entity184 down " and , um , " put your hands on your head "			2
' but what i heard was him then going back and saying " get down on your knees			0
get down on your knees "			0
and time was just ticking , ticking , ticking again			0
i did n't know who was left			2
' @entity42 , um , knelt down			0
and then the gunman scanning the room			2
and looking , he is expecting the police to come in the front door , seems to be blind that the back door is there and open			0
so he 's looking for the police to come in the front and he 's got the gun up high , holding it high and he 's scanning and moving around and shuffling			0
' and then his demeanour completely changes			0
it 's like he 's suddenly , like , steels himself , like suddenly goes very firm and very hard and very absolute in his body and feeling			0
' and then he shoots @entity42			0
so from the time that @entity42 was told to kneel , was some minutes			2
i ca n't remember how long those minutes or seconds were			2
but it was n't immediate			2
it was time enough for @entity42 to steady his heart and then he shot him			0

@entity21 , 72 , was the oldest of the remaining hostages inside the @entity3 cafe
she stood up to gunman man @entity37 because ' no one else had '
' i just do n't like your attitude ' she told him
ms @entity20 was trapped with her daughter @entity20 , who has @entity226 , for the *duration* of the 17 - hour ordeal
