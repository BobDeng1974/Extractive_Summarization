ridiculous : @entity1 mother of two @entity2 was shocked when she received a $ 10 fine from her kids ' daycare because they 're lunch did n't have any @entity8 crackers a @entity1 mom was slapped with a $ 10 fine because the lunches she packed for her kids ’ lunches did n’t have any @entity15 crackers			1
@entity2 sent her children @entity16 and @entity18 to daycare with lunches of leftover roast beef , potatoes , carrots , milk , and oranges			2
the daycare providers evidently did n’t think the wholesome lunch fit the nutritional bill because @entity2 was subsequently charged for the @entity15 crackers that the lunches had to be ‘ supplemented ’ with			2
according to @entity30 , @entity1 laws require that daycares provide children with a nutritious meal as prescribed by the @entity34			2
that means one milk , one meat , one grain , two fruits			0
but the daycare workers seemed to believe the lunches @entity2 sent with her kids lacked a grain			2
they have certain legislation that they have in place where you have to follow these food groups , but it does n’t matter how processed the foods are or if they ’re junk food , ’ the 33 - year - old @entity44 , @entity1 mom told @entity30			0
‘ @entity15 crackers count as a grain			0
’ @entity2 was angry , not just because she fined after sending her kids off with what seemed like a well - rounded , home cooked meal , but also because she was actually sitting on the board of the daycare when she was fined			1
unbalanced : she got the note , right , because @entity1 law requires that children at daycare be provided with a ' balanced ' lunch of one milk , i meat , one grain , and two fruits / vegetables			1
for each missing item , parents are charged $ 5 per child ‘ i phoned the daycare worker and said “ you know , potatoes , surely i can get away with this , ” and they did n’t actually end up charging me the $ 10 , ’ she said			1
the incident actually happened late in 2012 , but has only now gained wide media exposure			0
now @entity2 can look back and laugh			0
at the time , though , it felt anything but funny and seemed to point to a major disconnect between what is healthy for kids to eat and legislation that encourages eating nutritious foods			0
' they have certain legislation that they have in place where you have to follow these food groups , but it doesn ¿ t matter how processed the foods are or if they ¿ re junk food ¿ so @entity15 crackers count as a grain , ' @entity2 said ' but it was just the principle of the thing , that it was not considered a healthy lunch that i found ridiculous , ' said the mom and teacher who always believed she knew what 's best for her kids ‘ you could send microwave @entity105 everyday and that would count as a grain under the guide , ’ @entity2 said			1
‘ i would encourage parents to not just blindly follow the @entity34 , but really think about eating more real food and not packaged food			0
’ according to @entity114 blog , which first reported her story , @entity2 says the @entity117 province has moved to a hot lunch program in daycares in order to remedy the problem of parents sending less than ‘ balanced ’ lunches with their kids			1
she says she likes the new policy much better			0
' you could send microwave @entity105 everyday and that would count as a grain ' : @entity2 complains that the food guide rules in @entity1 are too easily misconstrued .			1

@entity1 @entity117 mom @entity2 got a note when her kids came home from *school* that said her kids ' lunches were n't balanced as per @entity34 rules
the rules say that for each item missing from the child 's lunch , the parent will be fined $ 5
