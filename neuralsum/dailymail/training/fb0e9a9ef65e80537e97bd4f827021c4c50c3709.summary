by @entity0 published : 12:59 est , 1 april 2013 updated : 12:11 est , 2 april 2013 gamers have waited for years for a @entity3 title to arrive			0
and just as patience was beginning to wane , two come along			0
@entity5 is composed of both @entity6 and @entity5			1
@entity6 takes place after the events of the previous @entity11 game - acting as a prologue to @entity13 , in turn , takes place nine years after the @entity15 falls into a coma			2
welcome back : the latest game uses the in - house @entity18 allowing @entity15 to be rendered better than ever powered by @entity20 ’ @entity18 , the game follows @entity15 and @entity22 investigating an organisation called the @entity24 – who are responsible for destroying the @entity26			1
although the gameplay trailer initially looked beyond current generation hardware , the @entity18 is capable of running on both @entity29 and @entity30			2
there has been no word yet on what next - gen platforms the games will be available on			1
although details are being kept under wraps , @entity5 creator @entity36 has described @entity5 as an open world game – giving the player more choice than ever before			1
fan - favourite @entity42 , however , will not be featuring in the games			1
speaking to the website @entity44 , @entity36 did n't involve @entity42 because he wants to create a ' completely new type of @entity5 game '			1
strange : on watching the gameplay video ( below ) , expect to see imagery not yet seen in the series @entity52 , who played @entity53 in 24 , is speculated to be playing @entity15			0
@entity54 is not the only long - standing voice actor to be replaced			0
notably last year , @entity56 dropped @entity57 for the upcoming @entity58 : blacklist			0
the 63 - year - old voiced lead character , @entity60 , since the series ' inception in 2002			0
the @entity5 games have sold more than 30 million copies worldwide , amassing widespread critical acclaim and awards in the process			2
@entity68 : @entity68 was @entity15 's only outing on current gen hardware - bar hd remakes - while the spin - off , @entity72 : @entity72 , features @entity73 as the main character			1
both ( especially the former ) rank among the console 's best - scored games			0
see the game in action here : follow us on @entity81 : @ @entity82 and on @entity83 : @entity84 .			0

@entity5 *consists* of two games - @entity5 and @entity6
powered by the in - house @entity18 which will work on current gen , although no word on next - gen platforms
@entity5 *strongly* **rumoured** to be an open - world game
fan favourite @entity42 - the voice of @entity96 since 1998 - will not feature and @entity52 **rumoured** to take over
