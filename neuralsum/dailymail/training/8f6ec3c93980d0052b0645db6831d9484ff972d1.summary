by @entity0 it has long been the bane of travellers ’ lives : the bag which is with you when you check in at your departure airport , yet is mysteriously and frustratingly absent when you land at your destination – leaving you gazing forlornly at the luggage carousel as everyone else leaves			2
an end to carousel woe ? the gps tags would let passengers check the whereabouts of their bags but help is at hand for every passenger who has ever had to make a frantic dash to the shops to buy emergency clothing , or endured a long argument with airline staff : the ' intelligent ' baggage tag which knows where it – and your suitcase – is at all times			1
@entity30 air giant @entity29 is currently working on tags that would use @entity32 ( @entity32 ) and bluetooth technology to keep track of a bag ’s location			1
this means that the whereabouts of a suitcase that has missed its connection could be pinpointed immediately – or that lost luggage could even become a thing of the past			2
the tags would also help guard against the problem of bags being delivered correctly , but stolen before passengers caught up in passport - control queues can retrieve them			1
@entity51 of @entity29 thinks that the tags could revolutionise air travel – and envisages the devices being rolled out by all airlines in the near future			1
‘ we have worked closely with our suppliers and with [ @entity61 airline ] @entity60 to try to make this an industry initiative , not just an airline initiative , ’ he told @entity57			0
‘ we thought it would be useless to just develop something for us			0
‘ we wanted to develop something that will benefit the industry and the passengers			0
‘ the idea was to create a product that can be used by a passenger flying with @entity29 , @entity73 , @entity60 , @entity74 or another airline , ’ he continued			0
‘ why would a passenger buy a permanent tag that can only be used on one airline ? ’ the tags are still in development , but the airline aims to start trials by the end of the year			1
a small group of passengers could be testing the devices by as soon as december			2
not lost anymore : the tags are still in development , but could be in use by the end of this year two types of tag are in development			1
the ‘ @entity97 ’ is a visible label which would be attached to the outside of the bag , and would communicate using @entity96			0
the ‘ etrack ’ would be placed inside a suitcase , and would operate via @entity32 as well as @entity96 – and could be traced by a passenger ’s smartphone			0
in theory , travellers would be able to check on the status and location of their bags throughout their journey – with , for example , the fact that their luggage has been checked - in registering on their phone within five seconds of the process ’s completion			1
@entity29 - @entity73 is not the only company experimenting with this concept			0
bag manufacturer @entity116 is working on a ‘ @entity120 ’ range , which would also allow passengers to keep an electronic eye on their luggage .			0

@entity30 air giant is developing luggage tags that can be tracked *remotely*
devices use gps and bluetooth technology , and can be traced by phone
two types of tag are in development - and could be in use by december
