if you ’re lucky enough to look about 18 , there ’s a good chance you ’ll be asked to provide @entity3 at the supermarket to buy alcohol , knives or glue			1
now an addition has been made to that list of potentially hazardous items – chocolate pudding			0
@entity12 was amazed when he was asked for @entity3 while buying a microwaveable pudding at @entity14			1
proof is in the pudding : shopper @entity12 was stunned when he was asked for @entity3 as the dessert posed a risk to the roof of his mouth mr @entity12 , 24 , was going through the self - service checkout when an on - screen warning announced that his purchase had to be ‘ approved ’			1
a member of staff at the store in @entity27 hurried over and asked mr @entity12 to produce identification			2
when asked why , the female assistant told him that the @entity30 would get hot when cooked and may burn him			0
mr @entity12 , a photographer , yesterday described the policy as ‘ crazy ’ health and safety			1
he said he did not have any id on him because he had just ‘ nipped to the shop to buy something sweet after work ’			0
@entity14 said the machine should not have requested proof of age for the dessert ( file picture ) a member of staff at the store in @entity27 demanded mr @entity12 produce identification showing he was over 18 luckily the shop worker approved the purchase anyway , saying she was satisfied he looked old enough to be trusted with the £ 1 dessert			1
mr @entity12 , from @entity27 , said : ‘ i scanned through a pint of milk without any problem and then the pudding			2
‘ the machine beeped , flashed up a warning on the screen and an annoying automated voice warned “ approval needed ”			0
‘ i only bought two items – and they were n’t alcohol , cigarettes , solvents or sharp – so i was clueless as to why they would need approval			0
the 24 - year - old described the request for his age as ' health and safety gone mad ' ‘ the woman who was monitoring the self - service checkouts came over and asked me for identification showing i was 18			1
i asked her why and was stunned when she told me : “ it gets hot when you cook it – and you may burn yourself ”			0
surely the same can be said of many of the products they sell in any supermarket ? health and safety has gone crazy if you now have to prove you can be trusted with a chocolate pudding			2
’ he added : ‘ i explained that i did n’t have any @entity3			0
thankfully she agreed that i looked over 18 and she scanned her staff pass to approve the sale			0
’ mr @entity12 managed to cook and eat the dessert that evening without injury			2
@entity14 said : ‘ the self service machines can be temperamental			1
the pudding should not be an age - restricted product			1
it ’s a mystery why the machine prompted staff to ask for @entity3			0

@entity12 *'s* purchase had to be ' approved ' at self - service checkout
staff member asked for @entity3 to buy the £ 1 dessert in case he burned himself
he described the policy as ' crazy ' health and safety
@entity14 said self - service machines can be ' temperamental ' and that the pudding should not be ' an age - restricted product '
