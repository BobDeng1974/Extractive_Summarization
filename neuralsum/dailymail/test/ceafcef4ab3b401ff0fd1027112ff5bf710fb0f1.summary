it was heralded as the world ’s oldest musical instrument ; a bone with two holes in it seemingly made by @entity6 to serenade their companions			1
but now a study says it ’s not an instrument at all - but rather , simply a bone chewed by hyenas and left in a cave			1
the research suggests historians have been fooled by these phoney objects - and , in fact , all such ‘ instruments ’ attributed to @entity6 are simply chew toys of animals			1
a researcher says a ' bone flute ' found in @entity23 is not an instrument - instead , he says it is simply a bone chewed by a hyena with teeth marks			1
the bone is shown here , believed to be the oldest musical instrument discovered in @entity31 , on show in @entity33			2
the bone was discovered on 18 july 1995 in @entity23 the latest analysis was conducted by dr @entity36 from the @entity37			1
in a paper published in the @entity39 of @entity40 , he took a look at several ‘ musical instruments ’ that had been attributed to @entity6			1
neanderthals may have created and worn the world 's first jewellery 130,000 years ago , according to scientists			0
researchers examining eight talons taken from a white - tailed eagle found at @entity50 in @entity51 say they were used to create necklace or bracelet			0
the claws bear multiple cut marks , notches and signs that they had been polishing by the @entity6 that once inhabited the site where they were found			1
anthropologists at the @entity61 say the talons appear to have been made into symbolic jewellery 80,000 years before modern humans arrived in @entity31			0
the findings add to evidence that @entity6 were not the slow - witted and primitive creatures they are often portrayed as			2
one in particular , the @entity68 , is often said to be the world ’s oldest musical instrument			0
the cave bear femur , pierced with two holes , was found in 1995 at the @entity73 near @entity74 in northwestern @entity23			2
dr @entity36 said analysis of the bone shows the holes are teeth marks , and the shape is just the result of the bone not breaking when it was chewed			1
in most caves , carnivore damage like this can be seen in about 20 per cent of animal remains and 80 per cent of bear cub remains			0
but while adult remains were often ‘ crushed to pieces ’ , bear cubs often had certain patterns like this			0
‘ these are not instruments , nor human made , but products of the most important cave bear scavengers of @entity31 , hyenas , ’ dr @entity36 wrote			2
‘ @entity99 left bones in repeating similar tooth mark and crush damage stages , demonstrating a butchering / bone cracking strategy			0
‘ @entity99 produced round - oval puncture marks in cub femora only by the bone - crushing premolar teeth of both upper and lower jaw			2
’ one instrument in particular , the @entity68 , is often said to be the world ’s oldest musical instrument			0
the cave bear femur , pierced with two holes , was found in 1995 at the @entity112 ( shown ) near @entity74 in northwestern @entity23 the latest analysis says that many bones found in caves can simply be attributed to animals around 30,000 years ago , rather than @entity6			1
shown is an exhibit of the life of a @entity6 family in a cave in the @entity122 in the northern town of @entity50 in @entity51 the first ‘ neanderthal flutes ’ were discovered in @entity23 in the 1920s and , since then , many others have been identified			1
sadly for those who thought @entity6 might have played music in this way to one another , though , it seems the earlier analysis may have been wrong			0
shown is the ' @entity68 ' bear bone , believed to be the oldest musical instrument discovered in @entity31 , in the @entity136 in @entity33 dr @entity36 derides all the research that has gone into these bones so far			2
he also points out that there is no evidence on the bones that tools have been used to make the holes , further cementing the idea they were made by hyena teeth			1
what ’s more , he also said that most of the ‘ bone flutes ’ do not actually date from @entity6 times - 200,000 to 30,000 years ago			1
rather , he says they can more closely be attributed to the @entity152 culture 38,000 to 29,000 years ago - sometimes said to be the first modern humans in @entity31 , owing to their grasp of using tools			0
‘ the “ cave bear cub femora with holes ” are , in all cases , neither instruments nor human made at all , ’ he concludes			0
‘ all cave bear pseudo-bone flutes are not dated to @entity163 layers , but instead , if possible to date , to @entity164 , @entity152 / @entity166 layers			0
’ he added : ‘ @entity99 left , therefore , “ pseudo-bone flutes ” during the @entity168 to @entity169 all over @entity31 in cave bear dens , and on different cave bear species / subspecies			0
‘ this is known due to lack of breakage on most of the cave bear cub femora , which generally show additional diagonal zigzag margins ( from chewing joints by scissor teeth of hyenas ) or have triangular or smaller scratch tooth marks			2

researcher says a ' bone flute ' found in @entity23 is not an instrument
instead he says it is simply a bone chewed by a hyena with teeth marks
he claims all such instruments were made by hyenas , not @entity6
and the bones do not even *originate* from @entity6 times
