@entity1 coach @entity0 will return to @entity2 for the fourth test against @entity4 this week to find himself embroiled in @entity6 membership unrest on and off the pitch			0
the county ’s poor form this season , coupled with major concern from members at their inadequate facilities in a ground revamped for the corporates to win back @entity16 , has led to calls for wholesale change			2
the rebel members , who have enough signatures from a rapidly dwindling membership to demand a special general meeting and a vote of no confidence motion , report that @entity6 ’s management have blamed @entity0 for leaving the side in a poor shape when he took the @entity1 job for a second time in april			1
trouble : @entity1 's @entity0 ( pictured with @entity29 ) is at the centre of a @entity6 membership unrest the fans ’ concerns centre on a flawed structure in which director of cricket @entity36 reports on playing matters to board member and close friend @entity39 , with the club failing to appoint an overseas batsman at the start of the season while making poor signings and depending too much on young players			1
@entity47 , one of the action group leaders , said : ‘ we have already voiced our serious worries to the club hierarchy but they fully support @entity36 as well as @entity39 ’s role			1
they intimated that @entity0 was at fault for the playing policy and not doing enough to sign a top overseas batsman			2
’ members ’ grouses over @entity2 involve their pavilion view being greatly obscured by a giant sightscreen that was n’t see - through as first promised			1
@entity6 chairman @entity59 has said that if members were unhappy with what he had accomplished with the ground development he would consider resigning and taking his board with him			2
scene is set : @entity2 hosts @entity1 's fourth test against @entity4 to start this week oops ! @entity67 's first minister drew barely a dozen journalists at his @entity70 wrap - up @entity67 ’s first minister @entity71 , who attracted barely a dozen journalists to his @entity70 wrap - up press conference , said one result of his self - ban on making political capital out of the event was that the @entity77 had never been more positive towards him			1
but he fully expects the usual hostilities to resume			0
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
@entity79 , @entity1 chief executive who seemingly had little or no role to play in @entity81 , is being remarkably well looked after in his new job as ceo of the grass - roots @entity84			0
@entity79 is understood to be earning a salary of around £ 150,000 a year in addition to bonuses , first - class travel and the use of a facility to work in @entity92 despite the @entity84 ’s hq being in @entity94			0
this largesse , paid for by @entity96 , comes after the extravagant decision to split the management of the participation - focused @entity84 with elite @entity100			0
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
@entity101 is the only sport that @entity103 have failed to win a medal at over two @entity70 despite the huge riches of the @entity106 compared to most of the other sports competing			1
and if @entity1 qualify for the debut @entity110 sevens in @entity112 as the @entity113 mandated team , they are unlikely to be able to call on @entity67 or @entity116 players			2
the two countries are showing no appetite to join a @entity113 side , just like for the football in 2012			0
really ? @entity121 described @entity81 as the ‘ stand - out games in the history of the @entity124 ’ @entity121 ’s blinkered view @entity121 , the @entity124 chief who deals only in huge positives , described @entity81 as the ‘ stand - out games in the history of the @entity124 ’ while passing the buck on the arrest of two @entity130 sporting officials for assault on the police			0
meanwhile , the @entity133 may have attracted a healthy peak of 8.4million to watch @entity136 ’s @entity135 win the 4x100m relay but their unkempt trackside interviewer @entity138 should be ashamed of toadying up to bolt by sympathising with him about being approached by the media while watching netball			0
journalists asking questions , whatever next ? ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... when @entity1 ’s @entity146 went on holiday to @entity148 , he was pictured smoking and having drink poured down his throat during a swimming pool party			1
in contrast , when his @entity154 team - mate and @entity157 @entity156 winner @entity155 was spotted in @entity148 last week he was shooting some hoops with the @entity161 ’s national basketball team on the @entity163 campus			1
big stars : basketball fan @entity155 met @entity166 star @entity165 on his visit to the @entity161			1

@entity36 and @entity39 also *infuriating* members
@entity67 's first minister @entity71 attracted few journalists to his @entity70 wrap - up press conference
@entity155 enjoyed time off by playing basketball after @entity146 's ill - *advised* ventures in @entity148
