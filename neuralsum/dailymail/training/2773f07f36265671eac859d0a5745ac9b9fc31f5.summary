rising from a dry dock , this is @entity2 's latest and possibly costliest piece of military machinery ever constructed			0
the world 's only superpower has released details of its new generation of aircraft carriers - the first of which costs a staggering $ 13billion - which it hopes will enable it to dominate any battlefield for decades to come			1
but that sort of money buys an incredible amount of firepower , with the ship stuffed with cutting - edge and top secret technology			0
the @entity32 also plans to buy another three such carriers , at a cost of $ 43 billion , to complete its fleet			1
but the project to build the most advanced aircraft carrier every made has come at a high price , with costs overrunning to the tune of nearly $ 3billion and major delays			1
@entity42 , spokesman for @entity43 , the maker of the ship , told @entity45 : ' the structure has been rearranged to accommodate new technology and meet all of the @entity32 ’s operational requirements			2
superpower : the new generation of aircraft carriers incorporates a host of top secret technology which is designed to secure dominance of any battlefield deadly : @entity22 will hold 4,000 sailors and marines and is designed to be virtually invisible to enemy radar the ship ’s structure and exterior are now 100 per cent complete , @entity58 said			1
but internal connections and features inside the ship are still being added			0
the ship began construction in @entity67 , @entity68 , in 2007 , but is unlikely to enter sea trials until 2016			0
the carrier would be fully capable by february 2019 , according to a critical watchdog report			0
delays ranging from between two and a half and four and a half years in testing three of the ship ’s most important new advances : its dual band radar , arresting gear and the @entity79 that will catapult jets off the carrier have become serious issues			1
power : the @entity22 is the new generation of aircraft carriers capable of launching 220 airstrikes a day rising costs : the @entity22 is expected to cost taxpayers more than £ 13billion when it is finally completed new generation : the giant 1,106 - foot ship is currently under construction at a dry dock in @entity67 , @entity68 , but will not be commissioned until 2016 and the spiralling costs come at a time when the @entity32 is seaching for ways to plug a $ 14 billion cut in the upcoming fiscal year as a result of the automatic federal budget cuts known as sequestration			1
the state - of - the - art carrier has provoked strong criticism from some quarters , including the government 's own watchdogs			0
in a report earlier this month the @entity107 wrote : ' key ship systems face reliability shortfalls that the @entity32 does not expect to resolve until many years after [ @entity111 ] commissioning , which will limit the ship ’s mission effectiveness during initial deployments and likely increase costs to the government			2
' it added : ' the @entity32 faces technical , design , and construction challenges to completing @entity22 that have led to significant cost increases			1
' national security experts at the @entity123 , the @entity124 , have also called into question the value of the aircraft in future conflicts			0
' i ’m not persuaded they ’re worth twice what the old carriers cost , ' @entity129 , of @entity124 , told @entity45			2
christening : relatives of former @entity2 president @entity111 salute a model of a new aircraft carrier named the @entity22 during a naming ceremony at the @entity25 in 2007 state - of - the - art : this graphic illustrates the cutting edge technology in the @entity22 aircraft carrier			0

@entity22 will cost $ 13billion when finished
carrier will be *equipped* to launch 220 airstrikes per day
ship holds 4,000 sailors and marines and is virtually invisible to enemy radar
project faces criticism after becoming beset by delays and cost overruns
@entity32 plans to buy another three carriers , at a cost of $ 43 billion
