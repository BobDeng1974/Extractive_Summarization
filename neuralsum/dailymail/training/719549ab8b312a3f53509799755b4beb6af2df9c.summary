@entity3 , who was beaten by mr @entity5 in the 2012 @entity13 presidential election , gave the damning verdict during an interview with @entity19			2
scroll down to watch video critical : @entity3 has claimed @entity5 is being ' outperformed ' by @entity9 president @entity8 ' again and again ' on the world stage unflattering verdict : @entity3 claimed @entity13 's stature on the international political scene has diminished while president @entity5 , pictured left , has been in power while @entity9 's has elevated under @entity8 he said : ' i think most observers of the international political scene suggest that @entity9 has elevated itself in stature and @entity13 has been diminished			1
' mr @entity3 , who managed the 2002 @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33 , just months after the september 11 terrorist attacks , made the comments as he expressed his confidence the @entity36 will be safe for visitors			1
mr @entity3 added he would have no qualms about taking his own family to @entity9 to watch the @entity40			2
in spite of the @entity43 rhetoric he adopted during the 2012 campaign , mr @entity3 was also very complimentary of the @entity9 government ’s efforts to secure the site			2
he said : ‘ there 's never been a games that i know of that has been so targeted for specific threats as you 're seeing at @entity52			2
at the same time , the level of security preparations appears to be at an unprecedented level			0
‘ i believe the @entity40 will be safe			0
that does n’t mean there ’s a 100 per cent guarantee anywhere in the world today			0
but this is , after all , a dangerous corner of the world			0
speaking of the past : @entity3 was in charge of the @entity64 in @entity33 in 2002 , just months after the september 11 terrorist attacks , and said @entity9 seems to be handling security threats well ‘ the specific threats that have been leveled suggest that this is an area that could be targeted and therefore there 's a degree of risk associated with , well frankly life today in a world where terrorism exists			1
’ @entity3 said that while the warnings about the @entity76 terrorists and other specific women that appear to pose a threat to the safety of the @entity40 may come as shocking and scary to some , he sees them as examples of the efficiency of the organizers			2
‘ @entity86 intelligence work - that 's what happened with our games that gave me confidence that they 'd be safe , ’ he said			0
‘ now and then we 'll hear reports of an individual they 're looking for - that suggests they have pretty good intelligence so all in all , it seems to be a very effective security program , but again , no 100 per cent guarantee			0
’ changing tune : in spite of his harsh rhetoric against @entity9 during the 2012 campaign , @entity3 said that they were taking ever possible precaution in the lead up to the @entity36 one point that he parsed out was that he has a high level of confidence of the security at the ‘ hard sites ’ where the physical events will take place , keeping the athletes and spectators safe during the tournaments , but soft sites will remain an issue - just as they do throughout the world - because there is no way for security officials to check everyone in public areas			1
‘ terrorists can move almost wherever they want to go			0
it only takes one person to go through a sieve of some kind and so a place like @entity52 can be surrounded if you will , ’ mr @entity3 said			0
‘ i think that people can recognize that the hard sites and the athletes will be safe and spectators when they 're in the venues will be safe but it ’s the soft places that you ca n’t be 100 per cent certain will be entirely safe , but my guess is that @entity9 have done everything humanly possible to protect the @entity40			1
’ he maintained that while he still views @entity9 as a ‘ geopolitical adversary ’ of the @entity13 and the world since ‘ their friends are some of the world 's worst actors ’ that is not justification enough to keep the @entity40 away from the country			1
