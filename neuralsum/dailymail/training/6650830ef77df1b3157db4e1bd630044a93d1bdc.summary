by @entity0 , deputy political editor for @entity1 tens of thousands of middle class parents are being sent letters ordering them to repay hundreds of pounds of child benefit - even though many have already returned the cash			1
the letters , which say ‘ you need to act now ! ’ , have been sent to 30,000 families where one earner receives more than £ 50,000 a year			1
since january last year , families with someone earning between £ 50,000 and £ 60,000 a year lost a proportion of the child benefit			1
where one parent earned more £ 60,000 a year , the child benefit was lost altogether			1
a family with one child would owe £ 263 and £ 438 if they had two children			2
parents had to opt out of receiving the benefit - or fill in a self - assessment form if they were still entitled to some of the cash			1
around a million parents were hit by the benefit cut			1
but the government has sent letters to around 30,000 who it believes have yet to pay back the cash			2
a @entity39 spokesman said : ‘ those who have paid the tax charge due need not be concerned and can simply disregard the letter			2
@entity45 mp @entity44 said the benefit cut for middle class families was a ' nightmare ' ‘ the letter reminds taxpayers to include the charge on future tax returns and we would encourage couples to discuss between themselves which partner might be eligible for the charge			1
‘ if that is not possible , we can provide guidance to allay any concerns about who is to pay the charge			0
’ but @entity45 mps , speaking to the @entity62 newspaper , said the letters were ‘ disproportionate ’			0
@entity44 , a senior conservative mp , said : ‘ the nightmare of this new tax on families who want to do the right thing is far from over			0
' we knew it was going to be an administrative nightmare – and so it has proved			0
’ @entity73 , chief executive of the @entity74 ’ @entity72 , said : ‘ our tax and benefit system has become so complex that even @entity39 ca n't make head nor tail of it			2
‘ the taxman got 5.5 million bills wrong last year			0
until both our tax and benefit systems are radically simplified , mistakes will continue to be made and ordinary people will feel the pain			0
’ the tax office @entity39 has previously faced criticism for its use of blanket mail outs			0
in may , letters were sent to savers asking them to explain why their rate of tax was ‘ lower than the average for people with a similar amount of income to you ’			0
@entity39 admitted sending 1,000 letters to customers with an income of more than £ 150,000			1
proposals to hand the taxman the power to raid the bank accounts has also faced intense criticism , with critics pointing to @entity39 ’s track record of errors over the past decade .			0
