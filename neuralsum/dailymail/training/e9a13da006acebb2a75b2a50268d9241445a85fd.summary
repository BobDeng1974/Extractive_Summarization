@entity0 ' never doubted ' @entity1 would remain as captain for the @entity3 , according to @entity4			1
paceman @entity4 hailed @entity1 's show of character to disregard widespread calls for his head as skipper and lead @entity0 to @entity11 victory over @entity12			1
@entity0 bosses last week confirmed @entity1 's place as one day captain for next year 's short - format @entity3 , with 50 - over series to come against @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity12			1
@entity4 admitted that off - field distractions hurt @entity0 in a battling @entity21 summer against @entity18 and @entity12 , but said opening batsman @entity1 remains the right skipper			1
@entity4 said that @entity0 never doubted that @entity1 would remain as captain ' for us it was never a question really , it was all speculation with the captaincy , ' @entity4 told @entity28			1
' from the players ' point of view we never thought anyone else was going to lead us to that @entity3 , we never doubted			2
' for him i think he 's had more low points than most this summer , the amount of chat that was going on about his captaincy in the @entity21 matches then the one - dayers			2
' so to show the character he has to come through those , it speaks a lot about the guy			0
' it was a huge test of character : it 's a credit to himself the way he 's handled it all			2
' i 'm sure he had a lot of doubts in his mind of whether he should have captained the test team or the one day team			0
despite speculation he may be removed as captain , @entity1 will lead @entity0 in the upcoming @entity3 ' but all i can say is from a player 's point of view there was never any doubt over who should be captain			1
' @entity0 started their summer with a dismal 1 - 0 @entity11 defeat to @entity18 before grinding back to form to dispatch @entity12 3 - 1			2
@entity0 have lost five of their last six one day series , but @entity4 still insists the 29 - year - old @entity69 batsman is the ideal figurehead			1
' the person who will benefit most is cooky of course , because the players had no issue with who was going to be captain , ' said @entity4 , speaking at the @entity78 's awards night			1
' so for him it 's nice that chat wo n't be a distraction now			0
@entity1 's @entity0 side lost both their home 50 - over series this summer against @entity18 and @entity12 ' from that point of view when the distraction of people talking about it goes , it 's a good thing for us			1
' it 's a really exciting winter , with the @entity3 at the end			0
' the two series we 've got , in @entity18 and then against @entity19 and @entity12 , it should give us a good chance of preparing well for the @entity3			0
' it 's an exciting prospect for any player , so all the players are going to do their utmost to get in the @entity3 squad			0
' there were quite a few distractions throughout the summer , and the way we dealt with it , especially going one - nil down to @entity12 then coming back , it was a huge response for us			0
' the one day series as it was , with questions being asked about the captaincy , as players we just got on with it			0
' things like that are down to the selection panel not the media			0
' we 're really excited about the winter and hopefully we can put in a good show			0

@entity1 to lead @entity0 in next *february* 's @entity120
@entity4 says talk that @entity1 would be removed just ' speculation '
