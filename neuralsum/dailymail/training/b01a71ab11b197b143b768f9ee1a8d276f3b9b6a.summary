however brief this @entity1 has proved for @entity2 , it is developing rather nicely for @entity3			1
undeniably so , given the bond that appears to exist between @entity5 and @entity6 here in @entity8			1
a bond between coach and captain that has been central to the success the @entity14 have so far enjoyed , first in crushing @entity15 and then seeing off a spirited @entity17 team			2
what is good for @entity19 is also , you would imagine , going to be rather significant for @entity3			1
‘ unfortunately , ’ the former @entity36 forward then added with a smile			0
it is a fascinating dynamic , and one that goes someway to exploding the myth that @entity3 ’s new manager rules only with an autocratic approach			2
the truth is that as well as consulting @entity6 on the tactics for the @entity14 team , he has even sought his opinion on when it would be appropriate to invite the players ’ families to the team hotel			2
such dialogue might be something that concerns @entity21 when he likes to be ‘ the big man ’ but it is likely to be a source of encouragement for the @entity3 players who were slightly baffled by the way @entity60 indulged the @entity2 striker when sir @entity62 had lost complete patience with him the previous season			2
@entity60 would probably agree he gave @entity21 too much attention , given how disaffected his treatment of the 28 - year - old is thought to have left individuals like @entity6			1
as @entity62 revealed in his autobiography last year , he grew increasingly frustrated with @entity21 on a number of fronts			0
most notably with the way @entity21 ’s ability could be ‘ swallowed up by a lack of fitness ’ , adding that he had ‘ lost some of his old thrust ’			0
he also confirmed that he had indeed had to reprimand him for turning up at @entity80 on one particular occasion in no fit state to train			0
the relationship between @entity62 and @entity21 began to erode as far back as 2010 , when @entity21 handed in a transfer request			0
@entity62 covered the episode in great detail in the same autobiography , just as he confirmed that @entity21 had asked to leave for a second time , albeit verbally , towards the end of the 2012/13 campaign			0
understandably , the players were more inclined to side with @entity62 and it meant they were somewhat disappointed to see @entity60 ’s making @entity21 the focal point of the team when that role had been occupied by @entity6 the previous , championship - winning season			2
with @entity5 now coming in , @entity6 ’s status is sure to be restored			1
in fact there is every chance he will be made club captain			0
this is not to say @entity21 will be ignored			0
on the contrary , @entity5 knows @entity21 remains a talented footballer			2
but he would have also noted how @entity6 has comfortably upstaged his club colleague at this tournament , even if @entity21 was among @entity2 ’s better players against @entity109			2
it sure to lead to a culture change at @entity3 , with the @entity14 calling the shots in a collective effort to guide @entity3 back to the summit of the @entity116 game			0
popular : @entity31 with his @entity19 boss in training rally : @entity5 overseeing a training session together @entity5 and @entity6 already appear to have made great strides for @entity19 , despite the fact that the relationship that exists between them took time to evolve			1
it actually started rather badly , @entity5 emerging from his first encounter with the squad - a meeting designed to establish what had gone wrong for the @entity14 at @entity130 under the guidance of @entity132 – distinctly unimpressed with @entity6			1
@entity5 wanted the players to be candid but @entity6 stayed silent			1
‘ because it ’s all in the past and a lot of rubbish was written about it , ’ @entity6 is said to have replied in reference to suggestions he was part of a divisive clique that developed within the squad at that tournament			2
as a consequence @entity5 omitted @entity6 from his first game in charge , instead selecting @entity148 for a friendly against @entity150			1
that night news of @entity6 ’s move to @entity3 would emerge			1
on the same evening @entity5 would note how @entity148 struggled to operate in tight spaces			0
having declared he was a coach who would give a player three or four games to establish themselves , he dropped @entity148 for @entity6 for the opening @entity1 qualifier against @entity157			1
by then @entity5 had observed how well @entity6 had started the new season at @entity29 and within 17 minutes of the game against @entity157 he had scored to cement his place with @entity19 too			1
‘ the real love began on a summer tour of @entity164 at the end of the season , ’ recalled a leading @entity14 sports writer this week			0
with then captain @entity167 struggling for fitness , and @entity5 noting how supportive @entity6 was of some of the younger players in the squad – in particular the @entity174 players @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 – an important decision was made			1
for a friendly against @entity180 on june 7 last year , @entity6 was appointed @entity19 captain			1
by the following @entity182 was being consulted on tactics			0
after a difficult game against @entity185 , a contest in which @entity6 enjoyed @entity19 ’s one decent chance in a 2 - 0 defeat , @entity5 and @entity6 sat in the bar in their @entity192 hotel and discussed the possibility of switching from their traditional 4 - 3 - 3 formation to a back three			1
the idea was to employ a system that would create more space for @entity6 and @entity201			0
something that certainly worked against @entity15			0
\ pained : @entity6 's performances have outshone that of team - mate @entity21 @entity205 : the fortunes of @entity19 will rest largely on the shoulders of @entity6 's partnership with @entity201 with @entity6 in @entity19 to rehabilitate from injury soon afterwards , @entity5 took the opportunity to take him to matches to see @entity14 club sides already using the system			1
and @entity6 liked it so much he and @entity167 convinced @entity5 to stick with a back three when the former @entity216 coach had suggested 4 - 3 - 3 would be better suited to playing @entity17 this week			1
‘ if they say that i ’m going to listen to them , ’ said @entity5 on the eve of the match , although as it turned out he should have gone with his instincts			0
shortly before the end of a difficult first half he abandoned 3 - 5 - 2 and went back to 4 - 3 - 3 , winning the game as a result			1
prior to the @entity15 game @entity5 asked @entity6 how he felt about families visiting the team hotel on the day of the match			1
@entity6 thought it a good idea , not least because the players were feeling anxious ahead of a meeting with the defending world champions			2
so five hours before kick - off around 50 family members , among them @entity6 ’s wife and children , arrived in the lobby of the @entity240 in @entity241			2
a few hours later and @entity6 would celebrate a stunning goal against @entity15 by high - fiving his coach			1
‘ he is a good teacher ; very direct , ’ @entity6 has said of @entity5			1
‘ he has already studied the opponent before the training session so he has all the answers before we start			0
i like that about him			0
’ his door , say his players and coaching staff , is always open			0
‘ if you watch every player the relationship with the manager is very , very good , ’ said @entity31			2
‘ but everyone can see @entity6 has a great connection with him			0
‘ the manager has an open style			0
if you want something to change you can speak to him			0
you just have to have a very good argument ! ’			0

@entity6 and @entity5 relationship will benefit @entity3 , believes @entity31
@entity19 have won their first two games at @entity1 and sit top of @entity266
30 - year - old forward has scored three times so far in the tournament
two of which came in 5 - 1 destruction of reigning champions @entity15
