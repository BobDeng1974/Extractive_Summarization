by @entity0 you might think the future of driving will be limited to ‘ boring ’ driverless cars that take us from place to place			1
but @entity7 has other ideas in mind with their @entity11 bike that looks like something out of the film @entity14			1
they claim the bike , while autonomous , will be ‘ driving fun in the future ’ by reading your emotions and providing information on its augmented reality display			1
if you think it looks like something plucked out of the realms of science fiction , you would n’t be wrong			0
the @entity11 , which stands for ‘ @entity28 2 , ’ is intended to give us a glimpse of a future where vehicle interaction between man and machine is greater than ever			1
length : 3 @entity36 ( sleep mode ) : 0.99 @entity38 ( driving mode ) : 1.78 @entity40 : 2.36 @entity42 capacity : 1 the bike has four wheels : one at the rear , two in the middle and one at the front			2
at the top of the bike is a sliding panel that closes when the bike is not in use			2
‘ unlocking ’ the bike will slide the panel up , allowing you to sit in the middle and also provide an interactive display on the panel ’s interior			1
using this display you can then give the bike a destination you wish to travel to			0
the 2010 movie @entity14 : legacy features ' light cycles ' that look fairly similar to @entity7 's @entity11 the bike 's display uses augmented reality to display real - time information , and the windshield also changes colour from red to green according to your mood the bike seems to offer a number of different positions for a rider to be in , from kneeling to standing			1
how the rider would remain stable in some of these positions is unclear , but perhaps @entity7 are planning to include safety handles of some kind			2
it ’s also unclear what will power the bike , although an electric engine seems most likely			0
the sizeable rear of the bike could house the engine , or perhaps provide space for luggage as well			0
from the specifications the bike also seems quite large and fast – this is certainly something intended for road use rather than bike lanes or pavements			0
while the hardware specifications are still unknown , @entity7 has been busy touting the interactive functionality			2
as mentioned earlier , the interior of the upright panel has an interactive display on which , among other things , you can enter destinations and view traffic reports			2
but the @entity11 also reads emotions and can adjust its driving accordingly			2
the windshield , for example , changes colour with your mood			0
if you ’re angry it will appear red , alerting other drivers to your agitated state of mind			0
it will only turn green when you ’re in a better mood			0
and if you were upset , the @entity11 might suggest going to one of your favourite spots to relax			0
whether this will be more distracting than innovative remains to be seen			0
a model presents a @entity11 concept vehicle on the media day of the 2014 @entity125 at the @entity126 in @entity127 , @entity128 , 13 feb 2014 the @entity11 is seen during the 2014 @entity23 in @entity129 , @entity130 on 16 april 2014			1
the auto show will be open to the public on 18 april and will run through to 27 april but do n’t think the bike is all about automation			0
you can also direct the bike to enter ‘ driver mode ’ , where you can control it by tilting your body from side to side			1
about halfway through the video , @entity7 also shows how the interactive screen can be used to display augmented reality directions			1
no release date for the bike has been announced yet , and whether it would be allowed on main roads is unknown			1
but the design at least provides a glimpse of a future where driverless vehicles may be commonplace			0
for now , there is a ' @entity11 ' app available on @entity154 and @entity155 that lets you try driving the bike in a virtual environment			1
@entity7 says their unique interactive @entity11 bike design will be ' driving fun in the future ' the @entity11 bike can read your emotions and take you to your favourite places , according to @entity7			1

the car giant has unveiled its futuristic @entity11 automated bike design
revealed at the @entity23 , it looks like something out of @entity14
the ' @entity171 ' can take you to destinations at the touch of a button
a panel rises up when you sit in the bike with an interactive screen
you can also steer by shifting from side to side in ' driver mode '
@entity7 says the unique vehicle will be ' driving fun in the future '
no release date for the bike has yet been announced
