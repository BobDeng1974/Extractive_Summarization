a firsthand account of the @entity2 raid that killed @entity3 contradicts previous accounts by administration officials , raising questions as to whether the terror mastermind presented a clear threat when @entity2 first fired upon him			1
@entity3 apparently was hit in the head when he looked out of his bedroom door into the top - floor hallway of his compound as @entity2 rushed up a narrow stairwell in his direction , according to former @entity2 @entity15 , writing under the pseudonym @entity17 in ' @entity15			1
' the book is to be published next week by @entity19 ( @entity20 ) ’s @entity22 imprint			0
@entity23 says he was directly behind a ' point man ' going up the stairs in the pitch black hallway			0
' less than five steps ' from top of the stairs , he heard ' suppressed ' gunfire : ' bop			0
' the point man had seen a ' man peeking out of the door ' on the right side of the hallway			0
@entity23 says the point man pulled the two women out of the way and shoved them into a corner and he and the other seals trained their guns ’ laser sites on @entity3 ’s still - twitching body , shooting him several times until he lay motionless			1
the @entity2 later found two weapons stored by the doorway , untouched , the author said			1
@entity3 as wearing a white t - shirt , loose - fitting tan pants and a tunic			2
in the account related by administration officials after the raid in @entity45 , the @entity2 shot @entity3 only after he ducked back into the bedroom because they assumed he might be reaching for a weapon			1
tension : the raid of @entity3 's @entity44 compound was watched by president @entity83 and his closest advisers in the @entity85 of the @entity86 watching : in this undated image from video seized from @entity3 's compound , the @entity88 chief watches a tv programme showing an image of president @entity83 it took approximately 15 minutes to find -- and kill -- @entity3 in his @entity44 compound			1
involved in the mission in the early morning hours of may 2 , 2011 were 79 commandos that arrived in off in military helicopters from @entity100 , @entity101			2
the first helicopter foundered above @entity3 ’s compound and crash - landed in the outer courtyard			1
the other helicopter landed outside the house			0
the seal team forced their way into the compound by blowing the door with explosives			2
the commandos shot three men and a woman -- whom @entity20 officials said had lunged at them -- as they went up floor - by floor			2
on the third level , three of the @entity2 saw @entity3 standing at the end of a hallway as they reached the top of the steps			1
two women in the room took positions in front of the terror leader to protect him			0
one of the soldiers grabbed the women and shoved them away while one of the seals behind him fired at @entity3			2
the @entity88 boss was shot once in the chest and once in the head			2
code - word ‘ @entity138 ’ is sounded to @entity134 , a signal that their target is dead			0
the @entity2 then photograph the body for identification			2
on their way out of the compound , the soldiers blow up the broken - down chopper			0
the teams fly back to @entity147 in @entity101			0
@entity3 ’s body was then flown to a waiting naval ship , that buried at sea			2
@entity86 spokesman @entity151 would not comment on the apparent contradiction late tuesday			0
but he said in an email , ' as president @entity83 said on the night that justice was brought to @entity3 , " we give thanks for the men who carried out this operation , for they exemplify the professionalism , patriotism and unparalleled courage of those who serve our country			1
" ' ' @entity15 ' was due out september 11 , but @entity22 announced the book would be available a week early , september 4 , because of a surge of orders due to advance publicity that drove the book to the top of the @entity171 and @entity172 best - seller lists			2
the @entity173 purchased a copy of the book on tuesday			0
the account is sure to again raise questions as to whether the raid was intended to capture or simply to kill @entity3			0
@entity179 writes that during a pre-raid briefing , a lawyer from ' either ' the @entity86 or @entity181 told them that they were not on an assassination mission			1
according to @entity23 , the lawyer said that if @entity3 was ' naked with his hands up , ' they should not ' engage ' him			0
if @entity3 did not pose a threat , they should ' detain him			0
' in another possibly uncomfortable revelation for @entity20 officials who say @entity3 ’s body was treated with dignity before being given a full @entity195 burial at sea , the author reveals that in the cramped helicopter flight out of the compound , one of the @entity2 called ' @entity200 ' -- one of the pseudonyms the author used for his fellow @entity2 -- was sitting on @entity3 ’s chest as the body lay at the author ’s feet in the middle of the cabin , for the short flight to a refueling stop inside @entity45 where a third helicopter was waiting			1
this is common practice , as troops sometimes must sit on their own war dead in packed helicopters			0
space was cramped because one of the helicopters had crashed in the initial assault , leaving little space for the roughly two dozen commandos in the two aircraft that remained			0
when the commandos reached the third aircraft , @entity3 ’s body was moved to it			1
@entity23 writes disparagingly that none of the @entity2 were fans of president @entity83 and knew that his administration would take credit for ordering the may 2011 raid			1
one of the @entity2 said after the mission that they had just gotten @entity83 re-elected by carrying out the raid			1
but he says they respected him as commander in chief and for giving the operation the go - ahead			0
@entity23 writes less flatteringly of meeting vice president @entity236 along with @entity83 at the headquarters of the 160th @entity238 after the raid			1
he says @entity236 told ' lame jokes ' no one understood , reminding him of ' someone ’s drunken uncle at @entity245 dinner			1
' terror house : @entity3 's compound has since been torn down mission : @entity3 was killed during the 40 - minute operation by the elite @entity40 in his @entity44 , @entity45 , compound , seen here beyond such embarrassing observations , @entity20 officials fear the book may include classified information , as it did not undergo the formal review required by the @entity181 for works published by former or current @entity181 employees			1
officials from the @entity181 and the @entity259 , which commanded the mission , are examining the manuscript for possible disclosure of classified information and could take legal action against the author			1
in a statement provided to @entity173 , the author says he did ' not disclose confidential or sensitive information that would compromise national security in any way			0
' @entity23 ’s real name was first revealed by @entity271 and confirmed to @entity173			0
jihadists on @entity88 websites have posted purported photos of the author , calling for his murder			0
video : @entity279 ' @entity278 ' attacks @entity83 for bragging about @entity3 ...			1
