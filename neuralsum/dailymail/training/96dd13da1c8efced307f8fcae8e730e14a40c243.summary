it 's not often you hear of fears of a zombie invasion - and if you do , it 's almost certainly on television			2
but in the event of an apocalypse brought about by an army of the undead , civil servants would co-ordinate the military 's efforts to ' return @entity13 to its pre-attack glory '			1
the country 's contingency plans for a zombie onslaught emerged in a response to an enquiry from a member of the public			1
in the event of an apocalypse brought about by an army of the undead , the @entity22 has a plan in order to ' preserve the sanctity of human life ' among all the ' non-zombie humans ' a freedom of information request has shown the surprising level of readiness for the eventuality			2
the @entity35 would not lead efforts to plan for such a horror attack or deal with the aftermath , reported by the @entity40 , because that role would rest with the @entity42 , which co-ordinates emergency planning for the government			1
the @entity35 replied to the @entity46 request : ' in the event of an apocalyptic incident ( e.g. zombies ) , any plans to rebuild and return @entity13 to its pre-attack glory would be led by the @entity42 , and thus any pre-planning activity would also take place there			1
' the @entity35 's role in any such event would be to provide military support to the civil authorities , not take the lead			1
' consequently the @entity35 holds no information on this matter			2
' it is not unusual for the @entity62 to be called upon to save the day in zombie films			2
in 2004 comedy @entity65 , soldiers arrive just in time to save the film 's hero			2
earlier this year , troops in the @entity70 were trained using a mock zombie invasion			0
hundreds of military , law enforcement and medical personnel observed the @entity76 - style production of a zombie attack as part of their emergency response training			1
in the scenario , dubbed ' @entity82 ' , a vip was trapped in a village , surrounded by zombies when a bomb exploded			0
the vip was wounded and his team had to move through the town while dodging bullets and shooting at the invading zombies			0
an attack of the zombies in the 2004 film ' @entity65 '			0
in the film the @entity62 comes to the rescue at one point , some of the team are hit by zombies and have to be taken to a field medical facility for decontamination and treatment			0
last year , an official from @entity105 city council replied to a question asking what it would do in the event of a zombie rampage with a copy of a ' top secret ' internal strategy document setting out its response			1
@entity115 , service director of communication and marketing , wrote : ' in response to your request for details of @entity105 city council 's contingency plans for dealing with zombies , i can now release to you the following strategy document			1
' please note that this document contains various redactions as it has been considered that some information contained therein must be redacted for the purpose of safeguarding national security			0
' marked top secret , the document set out four alert states , from ambient zombie level where business would proceed as usual to the highest level - zombie pandemic level - where infection levels would be over 30 per cent			0
to avoid ' widespread panic ' , staff would be asked to listen for codewords on radio and television broadcasts to warn them that a zombie attack is under way			0
under ' health and safety ' guidelines , the document urged staff to remember the correct zombie - killing procedure : ' fully disconnect the brain - stem from the body through either blunt force or full head removal			0
