the @entity9 cartel in western @entity3 has long been known for making money from the production and transportation of drugs , such as methamphetamine , or ' crystal meth '			1
but now , it has turned to illegal mining , logging and extortion for its income , according to a government official			1
new source of income : @entity3 drug cartels have moved beyond drug trafficking as their main source of income , it has been revealed			2
above , a confiscated iron ore mining operation near @entity27 in @entity3 confiscated : the @entity9 cartel has turned to illegal mining , logging and extortion for its income			1
above , the same mining site conflict : two former informants of the pseudo-religious @entity9 are pictured in @entity35 state today , @entity36 , a special envoy of the @entity3 government in the @entity9 - controlled state of @entity35 , said the extraction and transportation of iron ore was now the cartel 's biggest moneymaker			1
' they are charging $ 15 ( £ 9 ) [ a metric ton ] for the process , from extraction to transport , processing , storage , permits and finally export , ' he told @entity52			0
it has long been known that @entity3 cartels , such as the @entity9 and its predecessor , @entity56 , engage in other types of criminal activity , such as the trafficking of people and pirated goods			2
but this is the first time the government has acknowledgement that a major organised crime group has moved beyond drugs			1
patrol : the extraction and transportation of iron ore is now the cartel 's biggest moneymaker , according to government official , @entity36			1
above , federal police fly over the @entity73 near @entity27 making money : ' they are charging $ 15 ( £ 9 ) [ a metric ton ] for the process , from extraction to transport , processing , storage , permits and finally export , ' said mr @entity36			1
above , the @entity84 port of @entity27 ' it is a criminal organisation like the mafia , ' said @entity87 , the @entity3 and @entity88 representative to the @entity89 on @entity90			0
' @entity56 , the @entity9 and , in part , the new , smaller cartels that have developed , like the @entity92 , are copying this new typology			2
' @entity3 authorities have counted at least 12 major drug cartels now counting illegal mining , logging and extortion among their main sources of income - but also estimate there are a large number of of smaller splinter groups			0
taking cover : since january , authorities have seized 119,000 tons of iron ore stored at several yards in @entity27 and have taken over the farming hub of @entity108			1
above , vigilantes in @entity35 lookout : this is the first time the government has officially acknowledged that a major organized crime group has moved beyond drugs			1
above , members of community police patrol a highway near @entity118 and the implications of the move are enormous - with organised crime in the general in @entity3 standing to diversify and become even more entrenched			0
federal prosecutors have not seen similar shifts in other cartels , according to an attorney general 's office official , who insisted on speaking anonymously because he was not authorized to speak about the topic			2
however , experts have disagreed - citing the @entity130 cartel , with its strongholds along the @entity133 - @entity3 border , as among the first to change the business model from merely production and transport of drugs to migrant smuggling and controlling territory through terror			2
drugs : the @entity9 cartel has long been known for making money from the production and transportation of drugs , such as ' crystal meth ' though drugs still tops their list , the @entity130 likely make as much from kidnapping and extortion , said @entity152 , director of @entity154 security consulting firm			1
' i 've never looked at [ @entity3 cartels ] as drug - trafficking organizations , ' he said			0
' they are multinational corporations that will react to market pressures and do what they have to do to stay in business			0
' the pseudo-religious @entity9 cartel has taken the model to another level - exploiting the main industries of the territory they control			2
@entity168 , president of the @entity169 of the @entity170 , recently told local journalists that he estimated drug cartels earned $ 1billion ( £ 600.75million ) in profits from selling iron ore in 2013			1
the federal government has issued 900 concessions in @entity35 to mine iron ore , mr @entity36 said			1
in 2008 , only 1.5 per cent of the iron ore exports to @entity179 went through the state 's port of @entity27 , but by 2012 nearly half of the exports to the @entity185 country were processed there			1
in relation to extortion , information from victims led government experts to estimate that the cartel earned $ 800,000 ( £ 481,145 ) to $ 1.4 million ( £ 842,000 ) a week just from that crime , he said			0
many of the @entity9 's extortion demands were made on @entity35 's lime and avocado producers , while the cartel even controlled the wholesale distribution center where prices were set and growers sell limes to the rest of the world			2
former president @entity204 warned against such a stranglehold when he first sent troops to @entity35 in late 2006 to fight @entity56 , the predecessor of the @entity9			0
clashes : vigilantes armed with guns prevent members of the @entity212 from escaping from @entity108 he said the cartel was trying to infiltrate all levels of society - and by the time @entity56 morphed into the @entity9 in 2010 , it seemed to control the entire state , including politicians and police who failed to act			1
more than seven years of military - style strikes failed to dislodge them , but the federal government was notably more successful after targeting the cartel 's financial resources			0
it took over the port of @entity27 in november and named mr @entity36 in january as a commissioner with special powers to try to clean up @entity35			0
violence : a man steals beer from a truck burning in a road block allegedly set up by fans of the @entity9 since then , authorities have seized 119,000 metric tons of iron ore stored at several yards in @entity27 , as well as liberating the wholesale lime center by taking over the farming hub of @entity108			1
the government has also arrested or killed many of the cartel 's leadership , but they did the same to @entity56 , only to see the cartel remake itself into something even more menacing			0
because of financial hits , the cartel is believed to now be struggling to pay informants and assassins			0
during its reign , the @entity9 's hold was so tight that vigilante groups eventually formed and armed themselves to fight back			0
with fighting escalating between the cartel and the ' self - defense ' groups , federal security forces finally moved in early this year			0
' @entity130 , @entity257 , the @entity9 are , for the most part , predators and parasites that become rejected by the communities , ' mr @entity87 said			0
the @entity9 's reception contrasts with that of traditional drug - trafficking cartels , which typically generate jobs and wealth for local people - buying loyalty and protection			2
the classic example is the @entity271 , the only pure drug - trafficking organisation left in @entity3			0
the recent capture of its leader , @entity274 ' @entity273 ' @entity272 saw hundreds of locals line the streets to protest his arrest .			0
