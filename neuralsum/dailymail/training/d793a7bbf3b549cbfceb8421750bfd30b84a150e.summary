historical documents expert @entity93 , of @entity95 , said the booklet shows how the @entity21 were wrong to believe they were safe from invasion after accommodating the @entity98 during the war			1

' they were clearly wrong and it is a very sobering reminder that no one in the world was safe from the evil of @entity5			0
' despite the fact that many @entity21 were sympathetic to @entity23 throughout the war , they were clearly earmarked by the @entity112 for invasion and for the same fate as all the other countries in @entity116			1
mr @entity93 said it was also possible that @entity5 might considered invading @entity6 first to establish an invasion force there for a later attack on the @entity72 mainland			0

' @entity6 had strategic links to @entity127 as well so it would have made tactical sense for them to occupy the country swiftly			0
' we have naturally come across invasion plans for @entity72 before but i have never seen one for @entity6			0
' we are really expecting interest from @entity136 collectors - it is , after all , part of their history that more than likely they were completely unaware of			0
' among the postcard set is this image of @entity143 , in @entity144 , which is now the home to the @entity146 this grainy image shows the docks area of @entity144 which would have been a key port for @entity5 to seize to launch any attack on the country although historians have discovered invasion plans for @entity72 before this is the first time a detailed plan for taking @entity6 has been uncovered expert @entity155 said the document shows how the @entity21 were wrong to believe they were safe from invasion after accommodating the @entity98 during the war this picture shows the built up centre of belfast - experts are expecting interest from @entity136 collectors as the dossier provides a chilling reminder of what might have been had @entity5 followed through with plans to invade the country it made military sense for the @entity23 to invade @entity6 as it was a perfect location to set up for an invasion of @entity63 the 2,464ft @entity172 situated near @entity173 in @entity174 the quiet spot of @entity176 , a glacial valley in @entity177 , was also highlighted in the document the contents page for the document highlights the detailed extent to which the @entity98 had planned an invasion of @entity6 @entity6 had strategic links to @entity127 so it would have made tactical sense for the @entity98 to occupy the country swiftly the front page of the dossier which shows that no one was off limits for the @entity98 when it came to @entity5 key spots were plotted on a series of eight fold - out maps , which would have been used during ' @entity59 '			1
