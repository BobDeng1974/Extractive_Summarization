@entity1 , who is the half - brother of former @entity9 prime minister @entity8 , lives in @entity10 and is dating @entity11			1
it is unclear why the 44 - year - old banker is interested in a @entity15 race in @entity7 , hinting that he may be trying to make inroads with another famous political family			2
political activist : @entity1 ( seen here with his girlfriend @entity11 in november ) is hosting a fundraiser in @entity10 for congressman @entity22 from @entity7 famous families : @entity1 is the brother of the former @entity9 prime minister and @entity6 is the grandson of former attorney general @entity25 congressman @entity6 is the only member of the former president 's extended family serving in @entity29 at the moment			1
the @entity31 reports that @entity1 - who has dual @entity4 and @entity9 citizenship - sent an email inviting guests to his home for a fundraiser on october 7			1
' i believe @entity22 is the kind of new leader we need in @entity29 , ' he wrote in the email			2
' he is pragmatic , principled , and willing to look past party labels in the interest of getting things done			0
he brings fresh energy and much - needed perspective to our long - term economic and social challenges			0
' @entity50 ties : the only other political donations @entity1 has made have been to senators @entity52 ( left ) and @entity53 ( right ) , both of whom are @entity50 and neither of whom represent @entity1 's home state of @entity10 it is unclear how many guests have been invited , but each has been encouraged to contribute between $ 1,000 to $ 5,200 to attend and be named as a co-chair			1

@entity72 reported that in 2004 during his marriage to his now - ex - wife @entity76 , the couple donated $ 5,000 to the @entity78 presidential campaign and the @entity79			0
' they were really the first political couple in @entity9			0
they were always compared to the @entity83 , ' showing another interesting overlap to the dinner fundraiser for @entity6			0
together : @entity1 , 44 , is dating the 27 - year - old actress and fashion designer and the house in @entity10 's @entity89 that they bought together is now on the market @entity6 , 32 , assumed office just nine months ago but because of @entity15 ' two - term cycle , apparently the october 7 fundraiser is already needed			1
when he came to office in january , his family name returned to the @entity96 as his cousin @entity97 's retirement from @entity15 in 2011 was the first time since 1947 that there was no @entity6 holding elected office			0
