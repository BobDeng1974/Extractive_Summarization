@entity0 celebrates scoring against @entity9 to put @entity1 two goals ahead at @entity27 @entity0 's goal was vital in earning @entity1 all three points , but he insists his team must n't look too far ahead @entity0 , who scored @entity1 's second goal just before half - time , insists focus must be completely on the here and now			1

' despite @entity48 's deflected header , @entity1 held on to win 2 - 1 and move above their hosts @entity51 's fabulous volleyed goal had earlier been controversially disallowed for offside after seeing an early 25 - yard effort from former @entity7 midfielder @entity51 somewhat controversially ruled out for offside , @entity1 took the lead through a penalty from @entity56 on 41 minutes , with @entity0 sliding in a second at close range just before half - time			1
