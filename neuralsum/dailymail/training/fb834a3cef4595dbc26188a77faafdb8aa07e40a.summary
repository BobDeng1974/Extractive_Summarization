brightly - coloured primary school classrooms are being toned down with shades of beige to calm rowdy pupils - but fed - up teachers say the bland tones make them feel like they are working in @entity6			1
some schools , including @entity9 pre-prep school in @entity10 , are choosing to replace garish primary colours with neutral tones to calm children down while improving their behaviour and attainment levels			1
several schools and councils have employed @entity18 , an education expert who specialises in creating effective learning environment to help improve their classrooms			1
traditional , brightly - coloured primary school classrooms are being replaced with a muted palette of beige in a bid to calm rowdy pupils , particularly in younger classes - but some teachers do not like the changes @entity9 head teacher @entity29 told @entity30 : ' not all staff like the look of a beige , natural classroom and are comparing it with a @entity36 store showroom			1
' she went on to explain that they made the changes to a blander environment after noticing children appeared to prefer being taught outside in a natural environment			1
they replaced brightly coloured display boards to hessian and swapped colourful tables for natural wood - and ms @entity47 says the changes have had a clear impact on pupils ' focus and behaviour in the classroom			2
some teachers do not approve of the blander classrooms and say it makes them feel like they work at @entity6 ' children who are easily distracted are able to concentrate for longer periods if the spaces around them are uncluttered			1
' we have noticed this particularly when teaching early reading			0
' ms @entity18 , who has a background in teaching , told @entity68 : ‘ we know so much more about children ’s brains now and they are critical ingredients when we are thinking about environments			2
‘ we need to challenge some of the historical stereotypes about the way that environments have traditionally been set up for children , based on what we know today about brain development , language acquisition , child development and attachment theory			2
’ when asked about the @entity6 comment , ms @entity18 said : ‘ i would agree			1
a lot of the thinking we challenge , people hold onto because that ’s how they ’ve always done it and that ’s what you expect to see			0
‘ when you look in toy shops and the environments children are spending time in , they just give them sensory overload			2
‘ we need to get the balance right , that is so important			0
‘ in a world of information overload we need to be thinking about where are the places you can be still , reflect and consolidate your thinking ? we need to create more of that			0
’ in 2006 research claimed brightly decorated classrooms covered with colourful displays can damage children 's education and some primary schools were told to tone down their environments			1
the report from the @entity110 warned that classrooms which were too ' cluttered ' with colour could disrupt young children 's concentration			1
the report said : ' over-stimulating environments are not always the best			0
' that has implications for the use of displays			0
sometimes it is a visual overload for children			2
' it can make it very difficult for them to concentrate			0
' schools are replacing bright colours and de-cluttering classrooms to make them calmer places to learn the study focused on how the school environment can affect children 's speaking and listening skills			1
the report added : ' spaces should take account of environmental factors that can impact on learning , for example , light , colour , noise			0
' the environment should not be over-stimulating			0
' cosy , small areas , where children feel safe and able to chat in privacy are necessary			0

schools are choosing neutral colours in classrooms to calm rowdy pupils
they say method improves learning , especially in younger children
but some teachers say bland new environment is like working in @entity6
