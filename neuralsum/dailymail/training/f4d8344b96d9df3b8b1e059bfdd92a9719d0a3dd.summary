by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 insists it is a formality that @entity4 will get a new @entity6 contract as he looks to play into his late thirties			1
@entity4 brought an end to his 114 - cap @entity10 career on monday , saying the time was right for him to step aside in order to maximise his chances of being a dominant influence in @entity6 ’s midfield for the next ‘ three or four ’ years			1
that contract now has 11 months to run , but the club have been working on a deal through the summer			1
@entity2 was a key figure in discussions with @entity4 when he was deciding what to do about @entity10 and @entity6 ’s manager is looking forward to the opportunity of continuing working with a player who he has regularly said has ‘ given him everything and more ’ since he ’s been at @entity37			1
‘ a lot has gone on over the summer , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ i am very happy that @entity4 is now going to commit to @entity6 and i am sure that ( his contract ) is something we will look at			1
i know he can continue to play beyond this season			0
focus : @entity4 's decision to step down from @entity10 can help prolong his @entity6 career video @entity6 everything to @entity47 ‘ i have always said that			1
now he does n’t have international football , he will have that freshness			0
listen , for his own mind , i ’m sure he will want it sorted out , absolutely			0
you never want to leave players with not too long to go on their contract			2
it is something i am sure will get sorted			0
’ though @entity4 turned 34 in may , his importance to @entity6 can not be understated and last season he recorded the most assists in the @entity59 ( 14 ) and scored 13 goals of his own			1
if the @entity62 did not go according to plan for him , there is no sign that it has left his mark and @entity4 has looked sharp as @entity2 has put @entity6 ’s squad through their paces on the training fields at @entity69 this week			1
the intention is to give @entity4 his first action of pre-season on sunday in @entity73 , where @entity6 face @entity74 , and @entity2 is expecting his players to take another step forward after they lost 1 - 0 to @entity77 at @entity78 in the early hours of morning			1
@entity79 : @entity4 could make his first action of pre-season against @entity74 on sunday ‘ there was lots of encouragement from the game , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ we are going to be in the @entity87 , which is why we have taken games like @entity77 and @entity89 ( in august )			0
’ one issue arising from the match with @entity77 was the shoulder injury to @entity93			0
the striker , who could make a £ 14million move to @entity96 , will miss the rest of the tour but it is not thought the injury would prevent the transfer going ahead			0
aside from launching @entity4 back into action , @entity2 will also use the workout in @entity73 to give @entity103 — a £ 20m signing from @entity104 — his first appearance			1
@entity106 , the legendary @entity107 midfielder who is now @entity104 ’s sporting director , told @entity108 : ‘ @entity103 is a huge talent and has the speed and skills can make a difference in the @entity59			0
he ’s not a physical player , but he has the ability and the flexibility to escape defenders easily			0
challenge : @entity2 hopes @entity103 can fill the void left by £ 75m sale of @entity120 ‘ apart from that , he ’s a really focused player			1
he loves football and enjoys playing and watching the game			0
‘ @entity103 is also very cold blooded when he ’s in a one - to - one ( situation ) and he ’s not afraid on facing the opponents			0
he ’s always eager to learning , so i think he will adapt himself very quickly			0
’ @entity103 is one of a number of players who have been signed to help @entity6 progress and show there can be life after @entity120			2
@entity6 handled his £ 75million departure to @entity134 , quickly , quietly and efficiently and the club ’s principal owner @entity135 felt the moment was right to sell him			2
‘ it was time for @entity120 — and time for the club — to make a break , ’ said @entity135 , who along with chairman @entity138 has sanctioned @entity6 ’s heavy summer spending			2
‘ he brought so much to the club but we brought a lot to @entity120			0
’ and as a message to any fans who might be fearful , @entity135 promised : ‘ i think ( next season ) you will see a very explosive @entity6 offense			2

@entity6 midfielder can be a dominant force for next ' 3 or 4 years '
@entity4 has 11 months left on contract he signed last july
@entity2 was key in @entity4 ending his @entity10 career
