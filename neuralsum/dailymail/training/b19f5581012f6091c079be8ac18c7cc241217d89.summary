immigration authorities are reviewing the case of a @entity3 veteran and @entity5 native who recently discovered he is not an @entity7 citizen despite having lived in the country for more than half a century			1
@entity9 , 58 , served in the @entity3 during the @entity10 and worked for the federal government , using a social security number he received when he arrived in the country as a child fleeing @entity14			1
the @entity16 man always believed he was a @entity7 citizen , and ironically , only made the startling discovery when he sought a passport to take a cruise with his wife celebrating his retirement after 22 years working in the @entity22 - an agency that requires citizenship and frequent background checks			1
citizenship nightmare : @entity9 , who has lived in the @entity7 since he was a nine - year - old , only recently discovered he is not a citizen - or even a resident that @entity30 cruise would have been his first venture out of the @entity7 since coming here nearly a half century ago			1
instead of a well - earned holiday , suddenly @entity9 was in limbo and under investigation by the @entity7 government , unable to leave for fear that he may be denied re-entry to the country he 's called home for almost his entire life			1
' i feel like my heart 's been ripped out of my chest , i really do , ' he told @entity45			0
' it is difficult to even speak about it , it really it , ' he said , choking back tears			0
since the @entity5 revolution , those who leave the communist - run island generally get fast - tracked to @entity7 residency , after which they can apply for citizenship			1
@entity9 arrived in 1965 as a nine - year - old with his mother and always assumed she had filed immigration papers			1
he married here , and had two children , one of whom is an @entity66 war veteran			0
' i served this country , ' @entity9 said			1
' i 've always tried to prove i 'm a good @entity7 citizen			1
i have always taught my children and grandchildren we need to be good stewards of this country			0
my parents came for freedom			0
we owe a lot to this country			0
' @entity7 dream : @entity9 arrived as a refugee from @entity14 and was issued a social security number and temporary paperwork , never realizing that his parents had not filed the relevant paperwork for him to become a permanent citizen serving his country : @entity9 served in the @entity10 war and worked for the federal government for 22 years - and no one ever questioned his citizenship the @entity87 points out that as a @entity5 refugee and military veteran , @entity9 wo n't face deportation , but he can no longer vote , nor can he leave the country			1
he faces prison and fines for falsely claiming citizenship			1
' i thought i was a citizen - i â€™ve always been proud of being a citizen , ' @entity9 told @entity87			2
' this has really messed with my head			0
' @entity7 citizens and immigration services spokesman @entity99 said thursday his agency is reviewing the case and will meet with @entity9 and his attorney , @entity103			1
@entity103 said a meeting was scheduled for next week			0
' when an error is discovered , either through the appeals process or by other means , we work diligently to review the case and take steps to correct the error and prevent similar issues from occurring in the future , ' he said in a statement			2
@entity103 said @entity9 's years of service in the military and his work guarding criminals , including @entity119 bomber @entity118 , should be rewarded not punished			2
in recent months , however , she said officials have been asking detailed questions about why @entity9 voted , suggesting they might be interested in filing charges related to voter fraud			2
retirement : it was n't until @entity9 and his wife decided to take a cruise to celebrate his retirement after 22 years working for the @entity22 that a passport application revealed the secret bureaucracy : now , instead of relaxing in the @entity30 , @entity9 may face prison and fines for voting when not a citizen she described the bureaucratic process as ' inefficiency in the extreme			1
' citing @entity9 's clean record , work history , tax payments and military service , she said , ' i 'm hopeful and optimistic , but it 's cautious optimism			0
' ' i think they are gravely embarrassed , ' @entity103 said of the @entity148 , ' and are trying to shift the burden on him now to make him look like a criminal			0
' @entity151 , a @entity152 immigration lawyer told the @entity87 that she had encountered similar cases but none as extreme as @entity9 's			0
' it goes to show you how broken the system is for a federal and a state agency to have not even checked his background - his criminal background , yes , but not his immigration background , ' she said			0
for @entity9 , his name being stripped from voting rolls was akin to having part of his identity removed			2
he broke down crying and could n't tell friends about it			0
' we should be enjoying this time in our life , ' said @entity9 's wife @entity171			2
' not living in fear that something bad might happen to him			0
