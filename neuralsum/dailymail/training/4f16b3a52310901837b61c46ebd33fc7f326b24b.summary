by @entity0 @entity1 want £ 12m from @entity2 for @entity3			1
two summers ago , that would have looked cheap , now it is another expensive gamble			0
@entity3 ’s form has been in steady , inexplicable , decline of late			2
@entity9 could join @entity2 big sum : @entity1 want a figure of £ 12million from @entity2 for the signature of @entity3 on the stretch : @entity3 is currently away at the @entity14 in @entity15 with @entity16 from a position as captain , he lost his starting place as a centre half , and could barely make the team as reserve left back			1
if @entity3 can recover the form of his earliest years at @entity1 he will be a snip			0
if not , this is more good money after bad at @entity27			0
worry : @entity3 looks to be in decline and has often been injured for @entity1 on the way : @entity30 seems happy to lose @entity1 's former captain			2

@entity3 looks set for a £ 12million move to @entity2
the @entity36 *defender* has *fallen* out of *favour* at the north @entity39 club
@entity3 's high figure makes him a big gamble for @entity2
