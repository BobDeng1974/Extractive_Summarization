by @entity0 published : 16:40 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 19:08 est , 17 october 2013 when a fan fell ill after trying to make @entity4 ’s recipe for chilli con carne , he set off a celebrity feud that is continuing to simmer more than 30 years later			1
miss @entity4 has become embroiled in a war of words with former @entity10 presenter @entity9 over accusations that the cookery writer failed to warn readers to pre-boil kidney beans to make them safe to eat			1
miss @entity9 reheated the row this week by claiming she was ‘ leaned ’ on by her @entity17 bosses to apologise for broadcasting the claim in the consumer programme in the 1970s			1
feud : @entity4 ( left ) became embroiled in a war of words with @entity9 ( right ) after a row over a chilli con carne recipe a viewer had written in to say he fell ‘ terribly ill ’ after trying out the chilli recipe in @entity28 , a best - seller published by the @entity17			1
it was discovered that he had failed to cook the red kidney beans in @entity32 ’s recipe thoroughly enough			0
the beans need to be boiled for at least ten minutes to destroy high concentrations of lectin , a harmful toxin			0
recalling the incident this week , miss @entity9 , now 73 , said @entity32 threatened to withdraw publication rights for the book from the @entity17 unless she received an apology			1
‘ at the time @entity4 was the biggest money - earner for the @entity17 , ’ she said			1
‘ she was the @entity42 of her day			0
‘ her cookbooks were a huge money - earner for the @entity17 and she was about to launch another book , and i am told , and i do n’t know if this is true , that she said to the @entity17 , “ unless @entity10 apologise i am going to take my book to another publisher ”			2
‘ the bosses said i had to apologise			0
it was the most obscure apology you have ever heard			0
i am not sure we did not put it to music			0
‘ what we said was [ the viewer ] made the mistake … and we told viewers they would have to make sure [ the beans ] were cooked , and @entity4 changed her recipe			1
i think honour was preserved on both sides			0
’ despite the passing of the years , @entity32 , 72 , remains furious over the suggestion that her recipe made the viewer ill. she also denied the suggestion that she had threatened to withdraw publication rights from the @entity17			2
she told the @entity68 last night that miss @entity9 ’s remarks in the 1970s were ‘ very damaging ’ because her original cooking instructions were ‘ perfectly safe ’			1
a spicy dish with a dash of controversy : @entity4 's chilli recipe tasty dish : the recipe for chilli con carne was ' perfectly safe ' according to @entity32 ‘ the recipe stated that the mixture should be brought up to simmering point in a flameproof casserole over direct heat , then transferred to a pre-heated oven , ’ she said			2
‘ this meant the kidney beans did not come off the boil for two hours			0
‘ the one person who had complained to @entity10 had not actually followed my recipe			0
the chilli had been made in a porcelain dish ( ie not flameproof ) and therefore placed in the oven cold			0
’ miss @entity4 said there was ‘ never any question ’ of her withdrawing publication rights			2
‘ i have always assumed that it was the production team that finally realised they had acted irresponsibly and committed a libel , whatever miss @entity9 thinks she now remembers , ’ she said			1
@entity4 ’s @entity99 , which has been reprinted many times , now contains a clear warning on the importance of cooking kidney beans thoroughly .			2
