@entity0 have been warned they could face the nightmare prospect of a move to their proposed new ground shelved until 2020			1
chairman @entity5 has secured a compulsory purchase order on the land surrounding @entity8 , but the last remaining tenant has been given leave to appeal to the @entity11			1
the decision forced @entity0 to admit this week that they were ‘ highly unlikely ’ to move into a new stadium for the start of the 2017 - 18 season			1
watch scroll down for ' @entity16 on his club 's ownership and potential stadium move ' @entity0 have revealed it 's ' highly unlikely ' they will move into their new stadium in 2017 @entity22 capacity : 60,000			1
distance from @entity8 : 4.95 miles			2
likelihood : it fits the bill , but @entity0 ’ rivals @entity28 , who will move into the stadium in 2016 , would oppose the idea			1
distance from @entity8 : 40.05 miles			2
likelihood : the capacity is n’t much smaller than the 36,240 - seat @entity8 , but the distance between the grounds is even greater than that travelled by @entity40 fans to see their team play in @entity42 last season			2
and that went down very badly			0
however legal experts believe the delays could be even longer and that @entity0 could find themselves tied up legally for another four years if the case goes all the way to the @entity48 courts			0
in addition to resolving the dispute , it is expected the new 56,250 - capacity stadium will take two years to complete once construction work begins , meaning the club wo n’t be able to move until the 2020 - 21 season			1
spurs have been wrangling with a local business for seven years over the final piece of land on the stadium site before work can start at @entity8			1
@entity62 , which is run by the @entity64 family , are refusing to leave until they are given adequate compensation for the inconvenience of relocating			0
@entity68 , a planning and compulsory purchase expert at law firm @entity71 explained : ‘ @entity0 face the prospect of an appeal to the @entity11 and @entity62 could appeal that decision too			1
this whole process could take up to two years in a worse case scenario			0
@entity0 will have to play away from @entity8 for one season @entity78 and @entity79 : the west @entity81 clubs shared @entity82 for two season between 2002 and 2004 while @entity84 was being redeveloped			1
@entity85 / @entity87 / @entity86 : @entity85 shared @entity88 with @entity87 between 1985 and 1991 before playing hosts to @entity86 until their extinction in 2003 @entity91 and @entity92 : both called the @entity95 home since 1947 in a move that his little impact on the success of either club and the two @entity91 teams have acquired almost 100 major titles between them			0
‘ @entity62 may even decide to pursue the @entity103 , which would bring another two year delay			0
this all means the club may not be able to begin stadium construction for another four years			0
‘ in 99 per cent of these types of cases a deal is agreed between the two parties			0
' it seems inevitable @entity0 will have to do a deal with @entity62 if it wants to avoid these delays			0
' the question is how much will it take to reach an agreement ? ’ as well as holding back the construction of the new stadium , legal experts estimate @entity0 ’ legal bills are likely to exceed £ 1million before the issue has been settled			2
@entity123 ' @entity32 has emerged as a likely temporary home for @entity0			0

@entity0 could have to wait until 2020 to move into their new ground
