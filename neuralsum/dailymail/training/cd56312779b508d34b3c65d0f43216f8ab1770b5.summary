a new stage show featuring a cast of plus - size performers is challenging society 's stereotypical views about what a dancer 's body should look like			1
nothing to lose , a boundary - breaking new @entity10 production by dance company @entity11 , shatters the perception that a performer must be slim and taut in order to be beautiful			1
the company 's artistic director , @entity15 , teamed up with filmmaker and fat activist @entity18 in order to explore and celebrate the movement of bigger bodies in the show , which will premiere at the @entity23 on january 21			1
ms @entity15 said she was inspired to work with a ' full cast of big - bodied dancers ' after noticing that her eyes were often drawn to the movements of larger people whenever she was near a dance floor			1
the choreographer recalled realizing that she ' needed to find someone who lives in the bigger body ' in order to move forward with her idea			2
she later enlisted ms @entity18 to ensure the show would n't be voyeuristic or exploitative			1
' i had no idea the level of abuse that a lot of [ the show 's dancers ] experience daily and how they have to prepare themselves to go out in public all the time , ' ms @entity15 said			1
' that 's quite shocking			2
' ms @entity15 , who will be ending her term as artistic director of @entity11 following this show , explained that she wanted to strip away all the judgement that people have ' around fat bodies '			1
she added that she hopes to create a space where the audience can view the plus - sized dancers in a ' different way and actually just enjoy the physical form moving ’			0
dancing queen : the choreographer said she was often drawn to the movements of the larger people on the dance floor , and thought : ' why are n't we seeing that on stage more ? ' mean girls : ms @entity15 said she was shocked to learn about the level of abuse that many of her plus - size dancers experience daily innovative moves : she also noted that the performers were the ones who showed her that they could use their flesh and shape choreographically the preview video for @entity34 shows the performers shaking their full figures and grabbing their bellies , and ms @entity15 noted that the dancers were actually the ones who first showed her the possibilities of using their flesh and their shape choreographically			1
ms @entity18 added that it has been wonderful to see the transformation of the seven core dancers who star in the show			2
' the opportunity to be in a dance theater show as a fat person is incredibly rare , so watching that kind of understanding of self and embodiment has been an incredible joy , ' she said			2
to accompany their stage performance , the dancers were also photographed for a series of still shots , which show them twisting and contorting in front of a grey cement wall			0
the haunting images , which were taken by photographer @entity128 , capture the performers graceful movements and defy viewers ' preconceived notions of what a ' dancer 's body ' should look like			0
body acceptance : ' the opportunity to be in a dance theater show as a fat person is incredibly rare , ' ms @entity18 said model ready : the dancers were photographed by @entity128 as they stretched and contorted their frames in front of a gray cement wall ballet beautiful : the plus - size performers prove that you do n't need to be model thin in order to create beautiful movements with your body flaunt it : the dancers show off their figures in dresses , leotards and lingerie in the series of still shots ' i do believe that there is a noticeable groundswell in body positivity and fat activism here in @entity10 , much more than there was ten or even five years ago , and it ’s long overdue , ' ms @entity18 told @entity165			1
' and for sure social media is playing a huge part in that by creating access to communities that encourage each other to critique dominant cultural ideas around fatness			0
' it ’s like this collective tipping point and i think people , regardless of their size , are sick of feeling pressured by a prescribed standard of ‘ physical perfection ’ , whatever that means			0
' she added : ' i believe audiences are eager to see a broader scope of bodies on stage			0
' that ’s what is so refreshing about @entity190			0
' bend and snap : the images celebrate the performers ' shapes along with their graceful poses time for change : ' i believe audiences are eager to see a broader scope of bodies on stage , ' ms @entity18 explained body revolution : ms @entity18 believes that the dance show is a sign that society is becoming more understanding about weight and size issues @entity190 is another example of how body acceptance movements and campaigns have gained popularity over recent years			1
last october , radio producer @entity214 showcased her amazing dance moves in a series of weight acceptance videos titled a fat girl dancing as a part of her @entity221			2
@entity214 is now starring in her own @entity223 reality series , @entity222 , which premiered on january 13			0
and in 2014 , a number of women took to social media to share photos of their bikini bodies after plus - size fashion blogger @entity230 posted a picture of herself in a two - piece swimsuit with the hashtag # fatkini			0
