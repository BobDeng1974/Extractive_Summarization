by @entity0 published : 06:05 est , 23 january 2014 updated : 07:02 est , 23 january 2014 a massive 36 years of scientific data generated by @entity4 ’s voyager spacecraft has been transformed into a powerful piece of piano music			1
the melody was created by a talented musical manager at @entity9 , the pan-european data network , which claims to be the most advanced of its kind in the world and serves 50million research users at 10,000 institutions			1
launched in 1977 , both @entity16 and @entity17 are now decommissioned but still record and send live data to @entity19			1
a very modern data - driven alternative to @entity23 's planets suite : orchestral work was created from 320,000 measurements taken by @entity16 and 2 to compose the spacecraft duet , 320,000 measurements were first selected from each spacecraft , at one hour intervals			1
dr @entity30 used proton counts from the cosmic ray detector over the last 37 years from @entity16 and 2			2
then that data was converted into two very long melodies , each comprising 320,000 notes using different sampling frequencies , from a few @entity38 to 44.1 khz			1
the result of the conversion into waveform created a wide collection of audible sounds , lasting from just a few seconds to a few hours			0
he used different groups of instruments and different sound textures to represent the two spacecraft			0
they continue to traverse different parts of the universe , billions of kilometres apart and @entity16 left our solar system last year			2
@entity30 , network services product manager at @entity9 , @entity55 , @entity56 , who is also a trained musician with a phd in physics , created the classical duet to find a new way to represent data through the use of high - speed networks utilised by scientific researchers			1
he used proton counts from the cosmic ray detector as a basis for the composition			0
' i wanted to compose a musical piece celebrating the @entity16 and 2 together , so used the same measurements ( proton counts from the cosmic ray detector over the last 36 years ) from both spacecrafts , at the exactly same point of time , but at several billions of kilometres of distance one from the other , ' said dr @entity30			1
' i used different groups of instruments and different sound textures to represent the two spacecraft , synchronising the measurements taken at the same time , ' he added			0
@entity30 , network services product manager at @entity9 , who is also a trained musician with a phd in physics , created the classical duet to find a new way to represent data through the use of high - speed networks used by scientific researcher			1
here he talks about the composition at the @entity90 2013 conference to compose the duet , 320,000 measurements were first selected from each spacecraft , at one hour intervals			1
then that data was converted into two very long melodies , each comprising 320,000 notes using different sampling frequencies , from a few @entity38 to 44.1 khz			1
the result of the conversion into waveform created a wide collection of audible sounds , lasting from just a few seconds to a few hours			0
using the computing facilities at @entity105 ( @entity105 ) , @entity9 was able to create the duet live at the @entity4 booth at the @entity90 2013 conference in @entity109			2
the result is an up - tempo string and piano orchestral piece			0
a massive 36 years of scientific data generated by @entity4 's voyager spacecraft has been transformed into a powerful piece of orchestral music			2
@entity16 's current mission ( illustrated ) along with @entity17 , is to explore the outermost edge of the @entity121 's domain and beyond while this project was created as an accessible way to demonstrate the benefits of networks to society , data sonification - representing data by means of sound signals – is increasingly used to accelerate scientific discovery , from epilepsy research to deep space discovery			1
dr @entity30 said : ‘ analysing the melody is exactly the same as looking at data in a spreadsheet , but using the ear			2
‘ the information content is exactly the same : represented by regularities , patterns , changes , trends and peaks			0
‘ in fact , data sonification makes it possible to get information about long - range regularities and correlations that are hard to spot just by inspection			0
’ @entity153 scientists are generating an ever - increasing amount of data - for instance at @entity158 ’s @entity157 – and @entity9 supports scientific projects so that researchers across @entity153 can use a super-fast network , which is the most advanced research network in the world			2
@entity16 crossed a new frontier , becoming the first spacecraft ever to leave the solar system , it was reported in september of 2013			0
thirty - six years after it was launched from @entity19 on a tour of the outer planets , the plutonium - powered probe is more than 11 1/2 billion miles from the sun , cruising through what scientists call interstellar space — the vast , cold emptiness between the stars , the space agency said			0
@entity16 actually made its exit more than a year ago , according to @entity4			0
but it 's not as if there 's a dotted boundary line out there or a signpost , and it was not until recently that the space agency had the evidence to convince it of what an outside research team had claimed last month : that the spacecraft had finally plowed through the hot plasma bubble surrounding the planets and escaped the sun 's influence			0
@entity16 now studies exotic particles and other phenomena in a never - before - explored part of the universe and radios the data back to @entity19			1
the interstellar ambassador also carries a gold - plated disc containing multicultural greetings , songs and photos , just in case it bumps into an intelligent species .			0

@entity30 , a musical manager at @entity9 , @entity55 , @entity56 , created the classical duet , which has been performed by an orchestra
the music is based on 320,000 measurements taken by @entity16 and @entity17 , which although decommissioned still send data back to @entity19
@entity212 was converted into two melodies , each comprising 320,000 notes using different sampling frequencies , from which the piece of music was formed
