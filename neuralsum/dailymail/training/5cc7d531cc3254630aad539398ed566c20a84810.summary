' @entity9 teenager @entity8 realized her dream of playing college basketball earlier this month , but has admitted it is unlikely she 'll get to play in another game as her condition worsens two weeks ago the 19 - year - old mount st. joseph freshman made the national spotlight when she took to the basketball court during a @entity24 basketball game in front of more than 10,000 fans			1
' it seems like it was just yesterday , ' she said in her school 's gymnasium , with the final score — mount @entity32 66 , @entity33 — displayed on the scoreboard ( the game was held at @entity37 's arena )			1

' as the inoperable tumor squeezes her strength and energy , @entity8 squeezes back , holding to life as tightly as she can			1

she sleeps a lot and has to use a wheelchair sometimes			0
' every day or every hour can be different , ' said @entity87 , her mom			0

' @entity87 said her daughter 's spirits fluctuate with her physical struggles			0
struggle : the teenager was a standout backetball player and former prom queen in high school , right ' if her right side is n't working , she gets very frustrated just because her body is n't cooperating , ' she said			0
