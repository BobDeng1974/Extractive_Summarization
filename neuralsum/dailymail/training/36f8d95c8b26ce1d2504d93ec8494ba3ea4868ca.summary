with the @entity1 taking place this sunday , we ’re all looking forward to seeing the stars in their finery on the red carpet			1
everyone always talks about the dresses , but no one sees the hard work that goes into creating the make - up and hairstyles that provide the sparkling finishing touches			1
@entity14 , head make - up artist for @entity15 , has worked with countless celebrities , including @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
before : @entity21 , 54 ( left ) , and her daughter @entity20 , 24 ( right ) , were thrilled to be given a makeover by @entity14 , head make - up artist for @entity15 as a celebration of sunday ’s ceremony , @entity14 met readers @entity21 , 54 , a nursing home administrator , and her daughter @entity20 , 24 , a vascular nurse			1
with a big family anniversary coming up , they were thrilled at the chance of a makeover to suit the red carpet			1
@entity21 is a lipstick lover , but does n’t normally wear foundation as she prefers to go barefaced			1
she sometimes wears brown sparkly eyeshadow and mascara for a special occasions			2
@entity20 , meanwhile , does n’t usually wear make - up — only moisturiser — because she has dry skin			1
her favourite cream is @entity42 ’s @entity41 ( £ 3.09 , waitrose.com )			1
@entity43 choose matte shades in flattering tones such as taupe , brown , bronze or khaki to give a smokey eye			2
use the medium tone all around the eyes to frame , and add definition into the lash line by smudging it with kohl pencil			2
for @entity21 , @entity14 recommended @entity58 's @entity57 to define your eyes try @entity61 , @entity62 ( £ 37 , boots.com )			1
a good budget alternative is the new @entity65 in @entity66 ( £ 3.99 , superdrug.com )			2
emphasise the eyes with mascara — take time to get perfect lashes rather than rushing this , as it gives a lift to the eye			1
it ’s best to avoid messy , glittery eyeshadow , as it falls down into fine lines on your face			2
also , steer clear of black — use it only to define inside the water line or with your mascara			2
try @entity85 ( £ 23.50 , lancome.co.uk ) or the new @entity86 ( £ 7.99 , boots.com )			2
keep your lips and cheeks neutral , but warm with rosy pink shades			0
teaming a warm nude lip with rosy pink cheeks is brightening for the face			0
@entity94 ( £ 21.50 , lancome.co.uk ) is perfect			0
the @entity95 ( £ 28.50 , lancome.co.uk ) is also a good multi-tasker , as it can be used for eyes as well as contouring and highlighting your cheeks			0
@entity100 for @entity20 , @entity14 recommended @entity101 in @entity102 for a bold lip colour when you are in your 20s or 30s the rulebook is there to be broken — why not try a bold lip and eye ? for subtle glamour , do n’t over-do the cheeks			1
@entity15 limited edition @entity112 160 ( £ 23.50 , lancome.co.uk ) is a perfect red - carpet choice			1
or try @entity101 in @entity102 ( £ 9.99 , boots.com )			0
it ’s important to use the right brushes , but it ’s imperative to make sure you have the right products , such as primer for the skin			1
use a primer underneath your foundation to give you an understated dewy finish			0
disguise any dark circles by applying concealer in a triangle formation			0
this will reflect the light and lift your eyes			0
the new @entity132 ( £ 29.50 , lancome.co.uk ) is great to use when you are trying to do your base in a rush , as you can dab it on to problem areas when you ’re on the go			0
opt for a taupe matte or peachy bronze eyeshadow , and smudge a waterproof kohl pencil into the lash line			0
try @entity142 waterproof @entity144 crayon ( £ 5.99 , boots.com ) in @entity147			0
the verdict after : both @entity21 ( left ) and @entity20 ( right ) were over the moon with their transformations @entity21 says : ‘ it ’s amazing ! i will definitely start to use browns and coral			1
i often wear blue and grey — but these shades have made my skin look radiant , without looking too sparkly			0
i love the warm pink lipstick too			0
' @entity20 says : ‘ nobody will recognise me ! i love it			0
i have tried to wear red lips , but they never look this good			0
’ this year @entity15 celebrates its 15th year as the @entity164 for @entity165			1
