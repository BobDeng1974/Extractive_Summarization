@entity14 mayor @entity71 , a @entity49 @entity45 , noted the city 's role in the two wars that framed the last century when unveiling plans for the centenary last month			1
' the eyes of the world will be focused on @entity14 once more and it is important that we send messages completely different from the messages of war sent in 1914 and 1992 , ' he said			1
such comparisons have riled @entity32 in @entity49 and neighbouring @entity32 , for whom @entity10 is a @entity86 hero , the shot he fired marking the death knell for centuries of foreign occupation over @entity32 , @entity92 and @entity49 alike			1

to some , like the woman at the museum , the two events were part of the same arc of @entity32 nationalism			0
according to that narrative , @entity10 was a ' terrorist ' bent on uniting @entity151 lands at the expense of @entity49 's @entity153			1
this was the official narrative for decades in socialist @entity156 , when @entity10 was venerated as a freedom fighter for all the nations and faiths gathered together by @entity160			2

organisers of the @entity14 commemoration , who are hoping to get funding from the @entity185 , say it will steer clear of the issue of whether @entity10 was terrorist or hero			1
the centrepiece will be a concert of the @entity217 in the city 's much - loved @entity218 , @entity14 's city hall - turned - @entity220 that burned down at the start of the 43 - month @entity69 siege of the city			2

the @entity32 events will be choreographed by filmmaker @entity267 , a @entity268 born into a @entity49 family but who later took on the @entity272 @entity151 faith , who plans to stage an opera about the assasination and show a documentary about @entity10			2

' we once all lived in one state ( @entity156 ) , and we never looked on it as any kind of terrorist act , as some historians try to present it today , ' said @entity289 , the @entity32 mayor of @entity14			2

100 years after 19 - year - old @entity10 assassinated archduke @entity11 and his wife , @entity12 , as they rode through @entity14 the act continues to divide opinion the demands of each side in @entity49 have changed little since its war - while the @entity153 want a more centralised , unified state , the @entity92 say they need their own entity like the @entity32			1
@entity32 leaders , meanwhile , look east to @entity32 , saying they have little need for @entity49 at all , much as @entity331 forces now in @entity203 are looking to @entity111 and rejecting @entity204			0
the political system put in place in @entity49 by a @entity335 - brokered peace deal in 1995 divvied up power along ethnic lines , fuelling corruption , stifling development and triggering unrest last month unprecedented since the war			0
the historian @entity133 , her office unheated since the war because the state @entity346 ca n't afford the bills , said all the centenary plans were inappropriate given the far more pressing economic and political problems facing @entity49			0
