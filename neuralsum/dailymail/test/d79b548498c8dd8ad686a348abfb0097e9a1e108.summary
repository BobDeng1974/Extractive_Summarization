police have dropped an investigation into a vicious assault on a huntsman just three months after it took place – despite a wealth of evidence pointing to the identity of a suspected attacker			2
last night the victim , @entity10 , 40 , who was beaten by balaclava - clad protesters armed with iron bars on ropes , condemned the decision by police as ‘ pathetic ’			1
he said : ‘ they could have made more effort			0
i ’ve been told that unless further evidence comes forward , the attackers are not likely to be found			0
’ attack : @entity10 , 40 , who is joint master of the @entity25 , on the ground during the confrontation with hunt saboteurs a video of the incident and a dossier of evidence , including some names of saboteurs and their car registration numbers , was given to @entity35 after the assault			1
the attack at @entity38 , near @entity39 , took place even though the 30 riders and their hounds were chasing only an artificial scent , rather than a fox			1
during the incident , mr @entity10 , who is joint master of the @entity25 , was sent flying to the ground , before being kicked in the head			1
he was admitted to hospital with concussion and broken teeth and his face was swollen			0
since the attack he has suffered memory loss			2
the face of the thug who kicked mr @entity10 was captured on video			1
following the attack , @entity35 issued the suspect ’s photograph , although he has not been identified			1
in an exclusive interview with @entity61 , mr @entity10 said : ‘ i ’ve been told by police they are shelving their inquiries due to insufficient evidence			1
it ’s angered us because we gave them evidence			0
i ’m beginning to lose my trust in the police			2
’ @entity35 confirmed they had stopped the investigation pending further information , but their failure to identify , charge or prosecute anyone involved has dismayed hunt supporters across the country			1
this is the face of the main suspect on the day of the attack , january 24 , about 15 protesters sprayed hounds with the perfumed chemical citronella to distract them from the scent			1
mr @entity10 said : ‘ i noticed they parked about 250 yards away			1
then five came towards us			0
they were looking for trouble – it was a hardcore element we ’d not seen before			0
‘ they were abusive and then one spat at me and then punched me in the face			0
a scuffle broke out and i slipped and one started kicking me in the head , stamped on me and the heel of his steel toe - capped trainer stuck in my mouth			2
i was knocked out for a few minutes			0
then the chap started swinging a rope with an iron bar			2
’ mr @entity10 , who has paid £ 500 for dental treatment since the attack , added : ‘ i feel let down and think the police could have done more			1
’ @entity106 , 42 , who made the call to police , is furious that the case has been dropped			0
‘ it ’s disgraceful , ’ she said			0
‘ if you had people assaulted in a city centre , something would be done , but in the countryside people forget about it			0
’ @entity118 , 53 , vice-chairman of the @entity25 , added : ‘ their decision is disappointing , but this highlights how difficult it is for police to do their job when saboteurs turn up wearing face coverings			1
’ the @entity125 is campaigning to ban saboteurs from wearing a face covering so criminals can be brought to justice			0
last night a spokesman for @entity35 said : ‘ we have been unable to move the inquiry further forward			2
at this stage the case has been recorded as undetected , however should other evidence come to light then it will be re-opened			0
