yesterday , the usually sedate world of bridge was in turmoil over the news that two world champions have been found guilty of cheating			1
cheating ? at bridge ? the complex , classy card game for sophisticates , much loved by maiden aunts with high morals and retired military men in the shires ? surely not			1
on the face of it , the two cheats — @entity15 , as it happens , who play together as a pair — could n’t have been more respectable			1
@entity18 , 61 , and @entity19 , 71 , are both eminent medical doctors — known , somewhat unimaginatively , as ‘ the @entity15 doctors ’ in the bridge world			1
@entity19 , 71 ( left ) and @entity18 , 61 ( right ) , were caught cheating by coughing to each other during bridge matches , giving themselves an unfair advantage last september , they spearheaded @entity15 ’s triumph in the world bridge championships , held in the luxury resort of @entity30			1
but now an official report into the victory by the game ’s governing body — the @entity33 — has been published , revealing that the @entity15 doctors apparently used a complex series of coughs to indicate to each other what cards they had been dealt			1
as a result , pending a possible appeal , the @entity15 will be stripped of their gold medals , and the world championship will be awarded to the runners - up , the @entity46 team			1
the case has striking similarities to that of the ‘ @entity50 ’ — major @entity51 who , in 2003 , was found guilty of cheating in @entity53 ? by communicating with his wife and another accomplice in the studio audience			1
all three were convicted of deception , and @entity51 was forced to leave the @entity58			0
one expects a certain amount of bad behaviour among players of other card games , such as poker , with its rather raffish image			1
but bridge has impeccable credentials			2
it has its origins in a 16th - century game called @entity70			0
as it evolved over the centuries , it has become ever more upmarket , perhaps because it tends to be the leisured and monied classes who have the spare time necessary to master it			0
it is a game played in the elegant drawing rooms of grand country houses or in smart flats in @entity80			0
a game played in one ’s club — and we are not talking about a @entity85			0
famous bridge players include @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			1
cheating is all but unknown			2
the pair were caught cheating during both phases of bridge , giving away their weakest suit during the initial bidding phase , then announcing their best card during the playing phase i have been playing the game for 30 years , and have never seen anyone cheat			1
and , of all the deceptions scoundrels might try to pull off , the ones allegedly perpetrated by the @entity15 doctors hit a new , horrendous low			0
bridge is a fiendishly complicated game but , in essence , there are two halves to it			2
first , you ‘ bid ’ — that is , the two pairs of players examine the cards they ’ve been dealt and they predict how many ‘ tricks ’ , or rounds of cards , they think they ’re going to win			1
they then play their cards and see if they achieve their predictions			1
that ’s why the official name of the game is @entity128 — you bid a contract , and then you see if you can make it			2
the @entity15 apparently cheated during both phases			1
they allegedly coughed during the bidding phase to reveal which suit they were weak in , giving them an unfair advantage			1
it ’s claimed they then coughed again during the second phase of the game , indicating the best card to play			1
they might have got away with it , but for an eagle - eyed opponent — one with pretty acute hearing , too , it seems			0
one of the @entity46 players , @entity149 , noticed the unusual amount of coughing and started writing down the frequency of coughs and what bids and cards they coincided with			1
his evidence was then passed to the referee , who allowed video and audio recording of the rest of the game			0
subsequent computer analysis of the recordings apparently revealed the deception			0
as @entity168 in the official rules of the game solemnly states : ‘ the gravest possible offence is for a partnership to exchange information through prearranged methods of communication			0
’ given the gravity of the offence , it is no wonder the @entity33 is throwing the rulebook — and what a hefty rulebook it is — at the @entity15 doctors			0
they have been banned for life from playing together in a @entity33 game			2
they also face individual playing bans of ten years each			2
if they are guilty , these bans are wholly appropriate			0
for bridge to work properly as the extremely enjoyable game it is , an exceptional degree of trust is required between opponents			2
because so much of the art of bridge depends on signalling to your partner what ’s in your hand through legitimate means during the bidding phase of the game , any illegitimate shortcut is particularly effective — and is just simply not done			1
the last time anything so scandalous rocked the bridge world was in 1965 , when the @entity204 pair , @entity203 and @entity205 , were accused of cheating in the @entity206 in @entity207			1
they were cleared , but the allegations were similar to the current ones			0
they , too , were accused of indicating what was in their hands , although they were accused of using finger signals			2
by a strange coincidence , a radio 4 play , recreating the story , is being broadcast this wednesday			2
one of the reasons amateur bridge is largely free of cheating — aside from the fact that it is played by upstanding pillars of the community — is the fact that it tends not to be played for money or , if it is , it ’s played for pennies , not pounds			1
only at the top end of the game do they play for a fortune or , as in this latest case , for high - level competitive glory			2
as with any human endeavour , when big money is involved , big crooks often are , too			0
the greatest bridge scene in literature revolves around huge amounts of money staked at the green baize table			2
during @entity245 's @entity244 novel , @entity242 cheats villain sir @entity244 out of £ 15,000 by signalling to boss m during the game by wiping his brow with a handkerchief in @entity244 , the villain sir @entity244 has been found to have been cheating , and making big money , at @entity250 , the @entity251 of @entity242 ’s boss , @entity253 @entity242 spots that @entity244 is using the old ‘ @entity255 ’ cheating routine — @entity244 places his gleaming , silver cigarette case on the table while he ’s dealing , so he can see the other players ’ cards in its reflection			1
@entity242 gets his own back on @entity264 by cheating in an even more sophisticated way			2
he fiddles the hand so that @entity244 apparently has very good cards , and he , @entity242 , has terrible ones			0
@entity242 then makes what looks like a wildly stupid , over-confident bid			0
@entity264 gambles a fortune , reckoning that @entity242 is drunk — during the evening , @entity242 drinks a dry vodka martini , a straight @entity274 vodka from @entity275 , nearly two bottles of @entity277 ’ 46 and a fat measure of pale brandy from the @entity281 estates in @entity282			0
but @entity242 keeps his wits about him by slipping a stimulant , @entity285 , into his champagne			0
like the @entity15 doctors allegedly did , @entity242 signals what he has in his hand to his partner , @entity291 — this time , by wiping his face with his handkerchief			0
and then he proceeds to win every single round of cards — and fleece @entity244 of £ 15,000 , around £ 330,000 today			1
@entity245 , no mean bridge - player himself , borrowed @entity242 ’s fiddled hand of cards from a famous con played on the @entity301 , @entity303 ’s son , two centuries ago , which cost the @entity301 £ 20,000			1
it ’s been known as the @entity305 ever since			0
so , cheating in bridge is nothing new			1
but , usually , it ’s only in fictional accounts of the game that anything crooked happens			0
in @entity316 ’s 1936 @entity315 novel , @entity313 , the villainous dr @entity312 even uses bridge to commit murder			0
under the strange rules of bridge , at any one time one player is the ‘ dummy ’ who does n’t take part in the game			1
this is usually an opportunity for the dummy to organise the gin and tonics and whisky and sodas , but when dr @entity312 is dummy , he uses his break to kill his host			0
as i said , i ’ve never witnessed cheating			0
nor have i ever witnessed murder			0
some bridge aficionados might argue over which offence is the greater crime .			0

@entity18 , 61 , and @entity19 , 71 , found cheating at bridge
@entity343 involves two phases , a bidding phase and a playing phase
players look at cards and bid on how many rounds they think they can win
they then play the rounds to see if they can match their own bid
pair cheated during both , giving away weakest suit and *strongest* card
@entity46 player @entity149 *suspected* foul play , so hands were recorded
pending an appeal , the pair will be stripped of gold medals and world title
