she 's convinced that hamburgers were invented by @entity2 , thinks @entity3 is a man and refuses to ride a bicycle on the grounds that it 's dangerous and would ruin the shape of her legs			1
meet 20 - year - old miss @entity2 , a student studying @entity9 at @entity11 's @entity10			1
as a reward for good behaviour , she was given the task of escorting @entity16 photographer @entity15 as he toured @entity17 earlier this year			1
' she had never previously left @entity11 , ' explains @entity15			1
' it was a unique opportunity for her to visit her own country and to get to meet and speak to a foreigner			0
welcome to @entity17 ! @entity9 student and tour guide @entity2 stands in front of the @entity23 in @entity24 , capital of @entity27 province hitting the shops : miss @entity2 , who says hamburgers were invented by @entity2 , in front of a grocery shop in @entity27 's capital , @entity24 essential sight : during his tour of @entity17 , the patriotic miss @entity2 took photographer @entity15 to see @entity24 's @entity37 proud : miss @entity2 with her collection of stamps showing @entity17 leaders both living and dead , and right , a poster of @entity17 leader @entity43 ' she was shy at first , but became quite talkative as the days went on and told me what life in @entity17 is like for younger people , albeit without ever deviating from the party line			1
' miss @entity2 , who says her favourite place in @entity11 is the dolphinarium and her favourite animals the dolphins , told @entity15 of her penchant for @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 and was baffled when he asked if she liked @entity3			1
' i do n’t know who he is , no , ' she told him			0
perhaps her @entity59 nationality might have had something to do with it , with miss @entity2 insisting she only speaks ' @entity61 ' and telling the photographer that she ' hates @entity59 '			1
unsurprisingly , she 's also convinced that the hamburger was invented by @entity2 in 2009 , while @entity64 is the creation of @entity66			1
' they talk nonsense mr @entity15 , ' she said of the inhabitants of the @entity59			1
' i hate @entity59 ! ' she also declares herself to be less than enthusiastic about @entity69 , saying that while those crossing the border from the south would be welcomed , travellers going the other way ' would be shot '			1
troubling : miss @entity2 said she was unable to smile for this photo taken in the demilitarised zone because , she says , the sight makes her heart bleed divided : miss @entity2 tries her hand at using @entity81 's @entity80 ( left ) and ( right ) stares out across the demilitarised zone at @entity69 technology : although @entity15 's @entity80 left her baffled ( and horrified when she heard about @entity84 ) , miss @entity2 was happy to show him her polaroid camera favourite place : miss @entity2 's top tip for anyone planning a trip to @entity17 capital @entity11 is a visit to the dolphinarium - her favourite attraction unimpressed : miss @entity2 was annoyed to hear of an @entity59 website that claimed people on the metro are actors			1
' i hate @entity59 ! ' she responded miss @entity2 is , however , a fan of films , according to @entity15			1
' my favourite film is @entity100 , ' she told him			0
asked what it 's about , she added : ' it ’s about the mass killings perpetrated by the @entity105 against our people			0
' gladiator is another favourite , although she did reveal that some scenes proved to make for uncomfortable viewing			0
' some scenes were embarrassing , ' she said			0
' the scenes where you see a couple together			0
' @entity17 take a relatively old - fashioned approach to dating , with girls reluctant to even dance with a boy they 've only just met , while according to @entity2 , pregnancy outside of marriage and @entity121 are both unheard of			1
' that [ pregnancy ] never happens , ' she insists			0
' it never happens ! ' what about @entity124 ? ' we do n't have @entity124 here			0
' while miss @entity2 is happy to talk about her feelings for the @entity128 ( ' he was a pillar of my heart ' ) , she reacts with outrage when asked whether current leader @entity43 is attractive to women			1
' that 's an outrageous question ! ' she remonstrates			0
trying something new : miss @entity2 tries her hand at using @entity15 's camera and says she loves playing computer games when she 's at home burgers explained : miss @entity2 deciphers the menu for photographer @entity15 during a visit to a @entity11 restaurant			1
she says they were invented by @entity2 tasty : miss @entity2 tucks in during a barbecue lunch in a @entity11 park			1
the @entity9 student says she would like to visit the @entity150 one day family : although miss @entity2 does n't cycle , many in the countryside do as this photo ( left ) reveals			1
right : @entity17 still venerate leaders @entity128 and @entity2 honour : miss @entity2 says she is proud to have played the trumpet in an @entity159 such as this one ( pictured ) when she was seven years old colourful : taking part in the @entity162 which are held each year at the @entity163 in @entity11 is considered an honour by young @entity17 beautiful : according to miss @entity2 , @entity17 consider women with big eyes , a high nose , a small mouth and very pale skin to be especially beautiful other parts of @entity17 life are strikingly similar to @entity174 lifestyles , with miss @entity2 revealing a penchant for computer games and ambitions to travel abroad			1
' would you like to visit a foreign country ? ' @entity15 asks her			2
' yes mr @entity15 , i would like to visit @entity181 , ' she replies			2
despite her @entity9 skills , however , she says she wo n't be travelling to the @entity59 any time soon			1
' no , ' she insists			0
' i only speak @entity181 ’s @entity9 ! ' bizarre though much of what she says is , @entity15 is n't surprised			2
' the thing to remember is that almost everything she says is official propaganda , even the silly things , ' he explains			0
' people like miss @entity2 are taught this sort of thing from kindergarten , so in that sense , she 's a perfect citizen			1
@entity17 do n't see the disparity between what they think is good to tell us and what we can see for ourselves			2
' rules : people tucking into a burger are given gloves to eat them with according to miss @entity2			1
right : a group of pilgrims look up at a portrait of @entity128 treat : icecream is a popular treat in @entity17 with vendors often spotted selling them in the street , as in this photo which was taken in @entity209 treat : a caterer poses with a model burger in his restaurant at @entity213 - the most modern funfair in @entity11 which was renovated in 2010 fun : the @entity213 in @entity11 is a popular place for teenagers and twenty - somethings who live in the @entity17 capital officials : a group of @entity223 officials show off their identical blue and grey uniforms , matching hair cuts and scarlet armbands servant : according to miss @entity2 , soldiers such as this one photographed manning the demilitarised zone , are servants of the people during his travels in @entity17 , @entity15 had plenty of time to chat with miss @entity2 , who , he adds wo n't face censure from her government thanks to her strict adherence to the party line			1
here 's what she said : why does n’t @entity150 or @entity59 pop music reach your country ? ' because it is not what we like to listen to			1
but we know @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 ! ' what is the criteria for beauty in @entity17 ? ' a woman should have big eyes , a high nose , a small mouth and white skin , and she should not be skinny			2
women in @entity17 are truly beautiful flowers			2
' do women find @entity43 handsome ? ' mr @entity15 , that ’s an outrageous question ! ' why does nobody dye their hair in @entity17 ? ' we need to respect the haircut regulation - we have a lot of choice			2
having a different haircut is the last thing we ’re concerned about			0
' do you have any idea of the latest @entity269 fashions ? ' no , mr. @entity15			0
' young people buy jeans in which there are holes ... ' i do n't believe you @entity275 - you are joking			0
' would you like to have a car one day ? ' no , it makes people lazy			0
' who is the richest person in @entity17 ? ' we are all equal			0
' what happens if a @entity69 crosses the border and comes to the @entity17 ? ' we welcome him			2
' and if a @entity17 goes to the @entity27 ? ' they shoot him			2
' why do n’t women cycle in @entity11 ? ' because it is dangerous and it does n’t give you nice legs			0
' then why do women in the countryside all cycle ? ' they do n’t have much of a choice in the countryside			0
' who was @entity128 for you ? ' mr @entity15 , i can tell you that he was the pillar of my heart			0
' why do they give plastic gloves to the people eating hamburgers in the fast food places ? ' it ’s because we have n't gotten used to getting dirty when we eat yet			0
' is it true that @entity2 created the hamburger ? ' yes , it is ! in 2009 ! ' were you there during the famine ? ' we do n’t call it a famine , we call it the @entity320			0
' i want to offer you a gift , what would you like ? ' great leader @entity43 would be a great gift			0
' do you remember the day @entity2 died ? ' yes , dear leader @entity2 died on a saturday , but his death was only announced on monday			2
why ? ' because he said in his last wishes that he did n’t want to ruin sunday , the people ’s day off			0
' do you know what @entity2 was doing just before he died ? ' our dear leader had just signed documents to distribute 1kg of fish to every person in @entity11			2
' and did you receive it ? ' of course we did mr @entity15 ! ' hairstyles : until recently , male students at the @entity341 in @entity24 had to have this haircut			2
now they must copy @entity43 's unusual look essential : while women living in @entity11 do n't think much of cycling , for their country compatriots , the bicycle is an essential means of getting around normal life : two women share some lunch while sitting under a parasol as they look out over a city vista in @entity17 capital , @entity11 no fly zone : the departure board at @entity358 shows just one flight - to @entity360			1
the airfield is the hq of @entity17 flag carrier , @entity363			0

miss @entity2 , 20 , a student studying @entity9 in @entity11 , gave @entity15 a rare insight into @entity17 life
when she 's not studying , she likes to play computer games and says she hopes to travel to the @entity150 one day
*unfamiliar* with the *reality* of life in the @entity372 , she thinks @entity2 invented the burger and @entity3 is male
she is also convinced that @entity69 would like to shoot her and says she hates @entity59
@entity15 says much of what miss @entity2 believes is propaganda which @entity17 listen to from a young age
