habitable @entity1 - like planets could be in our own back yard - in astronomical terms , that is			1
researchers have identified three planets , which are between 300 and 600 light years away , as ' objects of interest ' - meaning they could be potentially habitable			1
but the closest of these potentially habitable planets is just 13 light years away			1
they orbit red dwarf stars , and the @entity15 university team say their findings show up that six per cent of these stars could have similar planets			1
planets that we could live on orbit red dwarf stars such as @entity22 the closest red dwarf stars - and their planets , which we could potentialy inhabit - are in our astronomical backyard of just 13 light years ' distance			1
and since red dwarf stars live much longer than @entity31 - like stars , any life on such a planet could be much older and more evolved than on @entity1			2
@entity15 astronomer and lead author @entity32 , who presented the findings at the @entity35 , said : ' we thought we would have to search vast distances to find an @entity1 - like planet			1
' now we realise another @entity1 is probably in our own backyard , waiting to be spotted			2
' new world : this artist 's conception provided by the @entity35 shows a hypothetical planet with two moons orbiting in the habitable zone of a red dwarf star			2
@entity1 - like worlds may be closer and more plentiful than previously imagined she added : ' you do n't need an @entity1 clone to have life			0
' a red dwarf is a small and relatively cool and low - mass star			0
there are several factors which may make life difficult on planets around a red dwarf star			1
planets in the habitable zone of a red dwarf would be so close to the parent star that they would likely be tidally locked , meaning that one side would be in perpetual daylight and the other in eternal night			1
the perpetual night zone would be cold enough to freeze the main gases of their atmospheres , leaving the daylight zone nude and dry			0
on the other hand , recent theories propose that either a thick atmosphere or planetary ocean could potentially circulate heat around such a planet , or life could survive by migration			0
alternatively , a moon in orbit around a gas giant planet may be habitable			0
she identified the planets by studying transits - when a planet passes in front of a star			1
the signal of a transiting planet is larger since the star itself is smaller , so an @entity1 - sized world blocks more of the star 's disc			0
researchers identified around 158,000 of the possible 75 billion red dwarf stars that make up the galaxy , discovering many were smaller and cooler than first thought			2
of that number around 95 planetary candidates orbiting red dwarf stars were considered possibilities , though all but three were neither cool nor smaller enough to be considered @entity1 - like			0
the three considered habitable - named @entity104 , were both warm and approximately @entity1 - sized , according to the findings			0
one was slightly smaller than earth while the other two were bigger			0
they each had a smaller orbit than earth of between 20 and 56 days and are around 300 - 600 light - years away			0
closer to home , it is thought that no other planets in our own solar system could support human life , forcing us to look further afield			2
