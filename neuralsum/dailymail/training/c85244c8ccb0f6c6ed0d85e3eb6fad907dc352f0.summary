in personal injury lawsuits , it can be notoriously difficult to establish whether a victim deserves compensation			0
currently doctors are used to decide whether an individual has sustained injuries that have left them unable to work again , but soon , wearable devices such as @entity8 could partially inherit this difficult task			2
and a law firm in @entity11 , @entity12 , is using the device to show what effects an accident has had on a client , marking the first time a wearable has been used in a courtroom			1
one law firm in @entity11 , @entity12 , is using a wearable fitness device - the @entity8 ( pictured ) - to show the effects an accident has had on a client , marking the first time a wearable has been used in a courtroom the idea is that a victim wears a @entity8 for a period of time , which monitors their activity , collecting quantifiable data that can be used by lawyers			1
analytics firm @entity34 has launched a service that involves the use of a wearable fitness device in personal injury litigation , in order to count steps taken by a victim and formulate a ‘ quantitative representation of the claimant 's activity during their normal weekly routine			1
’ the person ’s activity is compared to a database showing the average activity of the nation , with datasets weighted by age , gender , body mass index and wait circumference			2
‘ this offering provides quantifiable data backed by clinical research to support legal cases involving personal injury claims , ’ it said			0
the data will not be used in isolation , but will instead be used alongside other legal assessment tools , the client ’s perceptions in their own abilities , and other medical findings			2
@entity34 claims that the method is non-invasive and provides ‘ valid , objective and individualised information ' for personal injury cases , which may be caused by car accident ( illustrated ) for example a claimant wears a @entity8 for several months			1
data is extracted , including the number of steps taken , elevation and sleep patterns			1
the person ’s activity is then compared to a database showing the average activity of the nation , with datasets weighted by age , gender , body mass index and wait circumference			2
data is used alongside other legal assessment tools , the client ’s perceptions in their own abilities , and other medical findings			2
the company claims that the method is non-invasive and provides ‘ valid , objective and individualised information			0
’ ‘ the @entity103 is objective and represents a real - world assessment of function , ’ said dr @entity101 , founder of @entity102			0
‘ appropriate use of individualised activity data collected by wearables provides the legal profession with methods for the early assessment of the strength of their clients ' cases			1
however , @entity115 has asked the company if the method is completely fool proof , and whether a claimant could be deliberately less active than usual to try and tip the outcome of a case in their favour			0
@entity125 in @entity126 is using a wearable device in a bid to prove that a personal fitness instructor , who was injured in an accident four years ago , is forced to lead a less active lifestyle than someone of her age and profession , @entity124 reported			1
her lawyer , @entity135 , said the device will support her story and instead of relying on clinical interpretation , it will gather hard data for entire days			2
she has been wearing a @entity8 for several months			0
analytics firm @entity34 has launched a service that uses a wearable fitness device in personal injury litigation , in order to count steps taken by a victim and formulate a ‘ representation of the claimant 's activity during their normal routine '			1
this can determine if their injury has negatively affected their life ( illustrated ) ‘ we ’re expecting the results to show that her activity level is less , and compromised , as a result of her injury , ’ mr @entity135 said			1
‘ prior to this , legal teams representing personal injury cases had to rely on subjective , personally reported data from clients			0
‘ the @entity103 closes the gap between what a client perceives and what is objectively verifiable			0
‘ now that we have access to this invaluable health data , we anticipate that it will become an expected part of our practice			0
’ if the technique proves useful in court , wearables could one day be used in other types of legal cases , especially where insurers risk paying out large sums of money			0
this could lead to parties demanding data from @entity8 , or another wearable companies , to provide information about an individual			1
@entity191 , of @entity192 told @entity124 that wearables could become a ‘ black box ’ for the human body over long periods of time .			0
