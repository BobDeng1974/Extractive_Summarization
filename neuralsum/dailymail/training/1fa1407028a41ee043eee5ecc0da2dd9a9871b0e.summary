by @entity0 for @entity1 the government 's razor gang has found another victim - the @entity7 @entity6 long - standing travelling exhibitions program			1
the @entity8 has been forced to end its popular travelling exhibitions program due to @entity11 cuts			1
after 17 years of successful exhibitions , the @entity13 ’ affairs informed the @entity8 that it will stop its funding of the travelling exhibition program , effective immediately			1
in april next year @entity7 will commemorate 100 years since the first @entity18 landings at @entity19 but unless a private backer is found , there is no plan to reinstate the historic travelling exhibitions			1
part of the exhibitions are images form soldier and surgeon sir @entity27 , who captured the @entity7 ’ experience on @entity19 in 1915 in a series of candid photographs			1
( @entity33 ) @entity32 , @entity34 , may 1915			0
two soldiers of the @entity36 , 1st @entity37 , stand on the beach among boxes of corned beef			0
rows of petrol and water held in cans are in the foreground			0
the @entity8 's caption for the photograph is : ' here , in @entity27 ’s display of mateship , stoicism and dogged endurance , is the spirit of @entity53 '			2

this photograph from november 1918 , shows locals and @entity7 soldiers gathering on the street prior to a march and commemoration ceremony at the @entity57 cemetery , in @entity65 this picture from sir @entity27 's collection was taken in may 1915			1

captain @entity75 walks down the steps of the @entity77 , @entity57 , with his new bride @entity78 , a local @entity57 woman			1
he was a captain with the @entity79			0
@entity80 met @entity78 while he was stationed in the town			0
after the war they lived in @entity84 , where they set up a tyre business			0
they had two children and stayed in @entity84 until the @entity90 occupation of @entity65 in 1940			0
@entity80 was killed during the evacuations			0
the razor gang took $ 800,000 away from the @entity93 but at the same time the government spends more than $ 70 million on floor space for 2000 @entity97 employees , yet thousands of square metres remain empty			1
this includes $ 330,000 spent on immigration minister @entity101 's new media room , which has been dubbed ' the @entity102 ' because it is yet to be used			1
it even has a $ 800 door knob			2
there was also more than $ 15,000 of taxpayer dollars were spent on a second custom - built bookcase for attorney - general @entity108 because the old $ 7000 version was too big to fit in the senator 's new office			1
the exhibitions touring this year include the popular ' @entity113 : the @entity55 of @entity57 ' , which provides some amazing insights into the life of @entity7 soldiers behind the front lines of the @entity118 , through a collection of more than 800 black and white photographs			1
this series of amazing images is now on show in @entity124			1
the @entity8 has given @entity1 permission to display some of the priceless photographs for the benefit of readers who will now have to travel to @entity129 to have any chance of viewing them			1
@entity8 director @entity132 said exhibitions have been taken to museums and galleries across @entity7 for almost two decades			1

several of the soldiers wear identity bracelets in the shape of @entity7			2
c 1918 ' in delivering travelling exhibitions to the @entity7 public , particularly in regional and rural areas , the @entity156 has told the story of @entity7 ’s military history with support of the @entity156 ’s extensive national collection , ' dr @entity132 said			1
also missing in action now will be the likes of ' @entity166 : after @entity167 ' and ' a camera on @entity19 ' , which showcases photographs of the @entity170 drawn from private collections assembled during the @entity19 campaign			2
' the travelling exhibitions program has been delivered through supplementary funding of $ 800,000 a year , ' dr @entity132 said			1

care of the cemetery and graves was handed over to the local children			0
this is @entity57 , @entity65 during the period 1916 to 1918			2
' @entity196 will certainly not have found this an easy decision			0
' as a result , the @entity8 must cease the travelling exhibitions program			2
this will take effect immediately			0
' we are very disappointed			0
' all travelling exhibitions will return to the @entity156 once they conclude at their current venues			2
on average 200,000 @entity7 , many in regional areas , view the various exhibitions each year			1
' the immediate future is that some of the travelling exhibitions will go on to their next venue or destination and then come back to the memorial , ' dr @entity132 added			0

c 1916 - 18 he also hoped the funding cut would not lead to job losses			1
' i want to keep the staff if i possibly can ... we have six full - time staff , ' he said			0
' my priority is to do everything we can to look after them and i 'm reasonably confident we 'll be able to do that			0

the long - running @entity7 @entity232 ' program has been stopped after almost 20 years
the @entity234 withdrew $ 800,000 funding for the program
@entity238 cut for the historic images comes just a few months before @entity7 commemorate 100 years of the @entity18 landing on @entity19
the government 's decision comes despite *frittering* away millions of taxpayer dollars on leasing floor space in @entity129 which is **n't** even used
a new media room worth $ 330,000 was built for immigration minister @entity101 which is **n't** used
the government also spent $ 15,000 on a new bookcase for attorney general @entity108
all exhibitions must return to @entity129 as soon as their shows finish
those in regional areas will be the biggest losers
' @entity113 , the lost *diggers* of @entity57 ' is on tour but will finish in @entity124 on *october* 19
