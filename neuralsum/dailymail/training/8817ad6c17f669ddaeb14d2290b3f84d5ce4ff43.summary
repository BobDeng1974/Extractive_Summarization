by @entity0 published : 07:23 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 08:45 est , 12 march 2014 @entity3 radio dj @entity2 has spoken out for the first time about claims she threatened a colleague who later killed himself			1
ms @entity2 , 55 , was accused of leaving a series of threatening phone messages for colleague @entity9 , 50 , who worked for @entity10 and @entity12 radio , and suffocated himself in hospital 18 months ago			1
an inquest into mr @entity9 's death heard he feared a complaint of sexual harassment he made against a colleague , later identified by mr @entity9 's father as ms @entity2 , would spell the end of his career			1
but today ms @entity2 , who worked at @entity10 and @entity12 between 2005 and 2011 , gave her side of the story , saying : ' i understand why a grieving family looks for someone to blame			1
but their troubled son 's problems were not caused by me			0
' ' i am not to blame ' : @entity3 radio dj @entity2 , 55 , says she did not cause @entity9 's mental health problems now a dj at the digital station @entity33 , the mother - of - two said she became friends with mr @entity9 , a reporter at the station , when he asked her for career advice			1
she said he was upset about his job , fearing he was going nowhere at work , and saying he did n't get on with colleagues			0
writing in her new book , @entity42 and @entity43 , ms @entity2 said she became friends with mr @entity9 and went out to lunch with him so often that colleagues joked about it			1
but she said her friendship with him became strained when she had to cope with personal problems of her own , particularly a return of the cervical cancer she had got rid of a decade before			2
in her book , serialised in the @entity51 today , ms @entity2 rebutted suggestions she might have sexually harrassed mr @entity9 , saying : ' i did n't have time or energy to deal with my colleague , never mind try to shag him as he claimed later			1
' and she said he frightened her by taking her to a ' dogging ' hotspot , where couples have sex in cars , watched by others , one evening after telling her he had a good local story			0
ms @entity2 said that mr @entity9 took her to some woods and told her what dogging was , but said the pair fled when a group of men walked towards their branded @entity3 car looking menacing			1
' troubled ' : @entity3 reporter mr @entity9 died after telling @entity3 bosses he had been sexually harassed by a colleague as a result , she said , she asked him if he was wanting more than friendship from her , and said he replied rudely telling her if he was looking for a girlfriend , it would be one much younger than her			1
ms @entity2 admits in her autobiography that she ' probably ' did leave him voice messages , because she was angry and upset by his behaviour			2
she said he called her ' menopausal ' and ' old ' , upsetting her so much that she ended their relationship for good			0
but she insisted that she was not to blame for mr @entity9 's troubled state of mind or behaviour			1
after mr @entity9 's death his father , former @entity12 police chief @entity86 , named ms @entity2 as the woman who made threatening phone calls to his son			1
he said @entity9 was driven to his death after @entity3 bosses failed to take seriously allegations that he had been offended by a female colleague in 2007			1
glory days : @entity2 in 1989 when she worked at @entity95 with colleagues @entity96 and @entity98 and mr @entity99 said he his son had recordings of ' very unpleasant ' messages left by ms @entity2 on his son 's phone , branding him a ' flake ' and a ' loser '			2
the former police chief said shortly after his son 's death : ' they were very unpleasant and she made it clear that she felt she was on a different level to him			0
' a lot of things happened because he had to carry on working with her			0
he did not tell us everything but it badly affected him			0
ms @entity2 , who worked for @entity95 in the @entity117 , claimed last year that there was a culture of sexual harassment of women at @entity95 , and said she had been groped while working there			2
her claims about abuse at the @entity3 triggered a new @entity126 inquiry into the shelving of the @entity129 sex abuse investigation			0
