@entity0 may be @entity2 's mr @entity1 but it 's doubtful @entity5 boss @entity4 will be seeking his advice on team selection if his five - a - side line - up is anything to go by			1
the defender nicknamed ' @entity11 ' was asked to select from his favourite team - mates and the 25 - year - old @entity13 went out of left field by picking two goalkeepers , @entity16 and @entity17 , and @entity19 's @entity18 as his only defender			1
@entity2 boss @entity4 is unlikely to be talking tactics with @entity0 but @entity0 made up for his unorthodox defence by selecting @entity24 in midfield and @entity26 as his striker			2
‘ firstly , i apologise to any of my old team - mates if i missed you out , but it was so hard just picking five , ’ @entity0 told the @entity2 website			1
@entity0 picked an unorthodox five - a - side team with two goalkeepers including @entity16 @entity0 's side would be hard to score against with @entity16 and @entity17 between the sticks ‘ i 've played with some great goalkeepers			1
i do n't know , there are too many to choose from ! ‘ can i pick two goalkeepers ? well , it is my team ! i 'm going for @entity16 and @entity17			2
’ @entity19 's @entity18 would have his hands full as the only defender in the five - a - side team at least the attacking options looked good with @entity2 's @entity24 as the midfielder @entity2 striker @entity26 would link up in attack with hazard in @entity0 's side ‘ i 'm not going to pick myself , so the defender in my side is going to be @entity18 from @entity19			1
he is my good friend , we know each other from @entity51 and he is a good competitor			0
‘ my first attacking player is @entity24			0
it 's for obvious reasons			0
’ ‘ my striker will be @entity26			0
i know he 's going to compete , be strong			0
i think we are going to have a good team with these players			0

@entity0 was asked to pick side from his favourite team - mates
the @entity2 defender picked goalkeepers @entity16 and @entity17
he *completed* line - up with @entity18 , @entity24 and @entity26
