@entity2 @entity1 sen. @entity0 of @entity2 said thursday in a @entity4 video that she wo n't run for re-election in 2016 , sparking immediate discussions about an arms race among @entity9 liberals to succeed her			1
a fearless backer of abortion rights , gun control and environmental regulation , @entity0 boasted that ' i have about a thousand accomplishments ' first elected to @entity17 in 1983 and sent to the @entity18 ten years later , the 74 - year - old @entity0 told supporters in the brief video that she does n't feel old			1
' i feel as young as i did when i got elected , ' @entity0 claimed			1
but she would have been 82 if she had won and completed a fifth consecutive @entity18 term			2
the work is too important			0
but i will not be running for the @entity18 in 2016 , ' @entity0 said			1
she has said previously that she is proudest of the vote she cast against the war in @entity35 during the @entity37 presidency			0
leading @entity1 now expected to contend for her seat include @entity40 mayor @entity39 , attorney general @entity41 and lieutenant governor @entity42			2
@entity44 chief operating officer @entity43 has also been long - rumored as eyeing the seat			0
@entity43 was chief of staff to treasury sec. @entity46 when @entity48 was president , and could fund her own @entity18 race without missing the money			1
with @entity0 out of the race , at least , @entity51 would be free of the angst - inducing endorsement choice between her old political ally and one of her husband 's former advisers			1
the renewed energy surrounding a hotly contested @entity18 primary could create problems for @entity1 , however			2
in @entity2 's ' jungle primary ' system , the top two vote - getters advance to a runoff in the general election regardless of their party			1
while that could mean an expensive and divisive two - @entity71 slug fest in november 2016 , it could also present an opportunity for @entity74 challengers if too many liberals enter the race and find their votes split			2
not running : 2010 @entity74 @entity18 candidate @entity78 said through a spokeswoman that she has no intention of making a second bid for @entity0 's @entity18 seat @entity84 candidates could wind up in both of the top slots if only two ran and a more fractured @entity1 field included five or more hopefuls			1
@entity0 is best known in @entity2 as an environmentalist warrior , writing and passing laws that reclassified more than 1 million acres of land there as ' wilderness , ' a designation that bans motor vehicles , new roads and all mining			1
she also led efforts to prevent oil drilling in the @entity100 in @entity101			0
but her most memorable moment on @entity103 was a momentary gender - politics flare - up involving @entity106 army general @entity105 – who called her ' ma'am ' during a 2009 @entity18 hearing			1
' do me a favor , ' she interrupted			0
' can you say " senator " instead of " ma'am " ? ' ' it ’s just a thing			2
i worked so hard to get that title , so i ’d appreciate it			0
' gen. @entity116 quickly obliged – ' yes , senator			0
' in the military , regulations require addressing superiors – including members of @entity17 – as ' ma'am ' or ' sir			0
' but among feminists the term ' ma'am ' it can be seen as demeaning or patronizing			0
@entity125 , president of the @entity126 , told the @entity127 the following day that @entity0 was ' embarrassing herself by showing hypersensitivity and insecurity that is unbecoming to a @entity106 senator			2
' ' i 've always been suspicious of women who are insulted by pronouns , ' @entity125 jabbed			0
the episode became political grist during the 2010 election , when parody filmmaker @entity137 – of ' airplane ! ' fame – made an online ad mocking her			0
@entity0 is a liberal 's liberal , advocating for decades in favor of abortion rights , environmental regulations and gun control the 2 - minute spot included everyone from @entity150 chiefs and nuns to @entity153 scouts and surgeons insisting on being called by their proper titles			1
' we 've called her " senator " for 20 years , ' the ad 's voiceover intoned			0
' it 's time to call her " ma'am " again			2
' @entity0 bested former @entity162 ceo @entity78 by 10 points to win re-election			2
@entity78 spokeswoman @entity165 told @entity166 that she wo n't be running in @entity2 again			1
the one - time candidate has ' called @entity169 home since 2011 to be near her grandkids , ' @entity165 said			0
' she and @entity171 also lived in @entity169 for 7 years in the 1980s			0
' @entity172 is , however , scheduled to appear at the @entity173 on january 24 , fueling rumors of presidential aspirations			0
people close to @entity84 rep. @entity177 and former secretary of state @entity178 , both @entity2 , told reporters on thursday that neither will run for the open @entity18 seat next year			1
@entity181 minority leader @entity28 , a fellow @entity2 @entity71 , was visibly shocked on thursday when a reporter asked her about @entity0 's retirement during a regular weekly press briefing			1
the news had broken while @entity28 was at the podium taking questions			1
' what ? ' she asked			0
@entity189 : @entity0 famously upbraided @entity190 brigadier gen. @entity105 ( right ) in 2009 for calling her ' ma'am ' during a @entity18 hearing , even though he meant it as a term of respect @entity28 said the senator had phoned her office during the morning but she never took the call			1
' she called , she wanted to talk to me personally			0
i thought she wanted to have dinner tonight , ' @entity28 chuckled			2
she said @entity0 's retirement ' will be a great loss to the @entity106 , the people of @entity2 and , the country			1
' @entity0 's popularity among @entity2 has been on a downward slide for the past few years			1
one september 2014 poll from the @entity207 put her approval rating at just 41 per cent			0
@entity209 , @entity2 's senior senator , praised @entity0 's ' hard work in support of women and families , the environment , human rights and her tireless efforts to modernize our country ’s infrastructure			1
' ' she is never one to shy away from any challenge , and i ca n’t thank her enough for being such a resilient collaborator , ' sen. @entity209 said in a statement			0
' we blazed many trails together , and now i ’m eager to see where her next steps take her			0

@entity229 icon dropped her retirement *bombshell* in a @entity4 video with her grandson
says she does n't feel ' old ' at 74 and boasted that ' i have about a thousand accomplishments '
@entity181 minority leader @entity28 was visibly shocked when the news broke during her weekly press briefing
will set off new arms race to succeed her among @entity2 's leading liberals
@entity0 is most famous for *smugly* *ripping* into an army general for calling her ' ma'am ' during a @entity18 hearing
