by @entity0 published : 08:56 est , 31 july 2012 updated : 08:56 est , 31 july 2012 shatner in his heyday : @entity3 narrates @entity6 's mini-documentary about the @entity8 mission next week , one of the most daring missions in space will take place as @entity6 pushes the final frontier with a trip to @entity8			0
the @entity16 vehicle , which is the size of a car , will use a combination of parachutes , thrusters , and even a ' sky crane ' to navigate its way through the thin @entity8 atmosphere and land in a crater			1
the mission will culminate in ' seven minutes of terror ' as @entity16 relies on a complex series of instructions being executed perfectly			0
despite the intellectual skills and clever technological tricks employed by @entity6 , this may all sound a little quaint to @entity35 fans more used to galaxy - sprawling adventures in the 23rd century			1
so perhaps that is why @entity6 asked @entity38 - aka captain @entity3 - to narrate their documentary of those seven minutes			1
the @entity38 presented video will be used at events around the country and shared on the web and social media			0
also providing an alternative version of @entity38 is @entity46 , who joined the @entity47 to play ' @entity48 '			1
each provided their own unique narration to the video , which @entity6 hopes will make the videos more appealing to a wide range of audiences			1
the actors are icons to sci - fi fans worldwide through their work on @entity35 - albeit in two different generations of the show			2
artist 's impression of @entity6 's @entity16 on the surface of @entity8 the yellow oval shows the elliptical landing target for @entity6 's @entity16 rove in the @entity67 area of the red planetr			2
@entity38 today , where he is perhaps best known to younger fans for his role in drama @entity73 a recent study suggested that just digging inches beneath the surface could uncover complex organic molecules that could show that life once existed on @entity8			2
the rover , in a protective capsule , will hit the top of the @entity8 atmosphere at 20,000km/h ( 13,000mph ) and attempt to slow to just one metre per second to execute a soft touchdown			0
the landing system includes a supersonic parachute and a rocket - powered crane			2
it was expected that the @entity90 orbiter would track the whole descent , relaying @entity93 signals from the rover right up to the landing and for a few minutes beyond			0
the scoop on @entity16 , which is due to arrive on @entity8 in august , will dig four inches beneath the surface - enough to find the complex building blocks of life , particularly in new craters excavated by recent asteroid impacts			1
some scientists such as @entity103 of @entity104 believe that life may even have originated on @entity8 , then been carried to @entity106 on asteroids			0
the results suggest that , should @entity8 harbor simple organic molecules , @entity6 ’s prospects for discovering them during @entity16 ’s explorations are better than previously thought , said @entity112 of the @entity113 in @entity114 , @entity115 , lead author of the study			0
