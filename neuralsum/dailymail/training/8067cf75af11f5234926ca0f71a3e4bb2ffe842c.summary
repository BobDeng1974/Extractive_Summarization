more than six months since @entity0 unveiled plans to connect the world to the web using drones , more details have emerged about how exactly these flying @entity7 hotspots will work			1
at a summit in @entity11 , @entity9 's engineering director announced the vehicles will be closer in size to jumbo jets , than traditional drones , and they 'll soar at 65,000ft ( 19,800 metres )			1
the firm also announced it will begin testing the drones in an unspecified location above the @entity19 as soon as next year			1
@entity9 has revealed more details about its plans to provide web access to the world			1
drones as large as jumbo jets are set to extend the reach of @entity7 around the world			2
they will be powered by the sun and hover some 65,000 feet ( 19,800 metres ) above the ground @entity9 aims to use a mix of solar - powered aircraft and low - orbit satellites to beam signals carrying the internet to hard - to - reach locations			1
the drones , flying at 65,000ft ( 19,800 metres ) , will be capable of staying in the air for months			1
they are relatively cheap and will be most effective for suburban areas that do not have the cables or infrastructure to carry internet or telephone signals			0
the drones are effectively mobile phone masts in the sky and bounce smartphone communications between satellites and base stations on @entity52			0
low - orbit and geosynchronous satellites , which have orbits that match the @entity52 ’s rotation and are effectively stationary , will cover more remote areas in @entity58 and @entity59			2
the internet access would be transmitted in the form of free - space optical communication , or @entity63 , which transmits data using infrared laser beams			0
it could then be just three to five years until the super-sized , solar - powered drones are hovering above remote parts of the world to provide internet access			1
@entity71 , engineering director of @entity9 ’s @entity72 , told the @entity73 that the planes will be ‘ roughly the size ’ of a @entity79 , but much lighter than the popular aeroplane , which weighs around 600,000lbs ( 272,155kg ) without passengers or fuel			1
@entity9 previously said the drones will be ' relatively cheap ' - although did not specify a cost - and will be most effective for suburban areas that do not have the cables or infrastructure to carry internet or telephone signals			2
the @entity87 - based tech giant has joined forces with @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and other tech firms to develop the planes in an initiative called @entity95			1
today , around 2.7 billion people have access to the internet , which is just one third of the global population			0
the members of the initiative said in a report that connecting the world is ' one of the fundamental challenges of our time ' and they plan to do it using a variety of technologies , including drones			0
' when people have access to the internet , they can not only connect with their friends , family and communities , but they can also gain access to the tools and information to help find jobs , start businesses , access healthcare , education and financial services and have a greater say in their societies			0
' they get to participate in the knowledge economy , ' the report said			0
a recent study by @entity127 found that the internet is already an important driver of economic growth in many developing countries			0
@entity71 , engineering director of @entity9 ’s @entity72 said that the planes will be ‘ roughly the size ’ of a @entity79 ( stock image ) , but much lighter than the popular aeroplane , which weighs around 600,000lbs ( 272,155kg ) without passengers or fuel expanding internet access could create another 140 million new jobs , lift 160 million people out of poverty and reduce child mortality by hundreds of thousands of lives			1
in terms of how this could be achieved , mr @entity143 has previously explained that @entity9 is ' looking at a new type of plane architecture			0
' the drones are set to fly at 65,000ft ( 19,800 metres ) , because this altitude is a point where winds are at their lowest			1
it 's also above commercial airliners , and even above the weather , and this means the drones will be able to safely stay in the air for months at a time			0
‘ these planes are solar - powered and they sit there and circle around , and have the ability to broadcast internet down			0
’ @entity9 ’s founder and ceo @entity0 announced in march that the social network ’s @entity72 was building ‘ drones , satellites and lasers to deliver the internet to everyone ' the large drones will be capable of broadcasting a powerful signal that covers a city - sized area of territory with a medium population density , according to @entity95			2
the large drones will be capable of broadcasting a powerful @entity177 drones will be tougher and able to fly for longer periods of time than balloons , while also being able to have their location precisely controlled			2
in march this year , @entity9 acquired @entity184 drone maker @entity183 for an estimated £ 12.5 million ( $ 20.2 million )			2
the company is run by chief engineer @entity186 who has helped set records for the longest flights for unmanned aircraft powered by the sun.			0

@entity9 's drones are set to soar at 65,000ft ( 19,800 metres )
they will provide web access to remote areas of the world
the crafts will be as large as @entity79 jet liners , but much lighter
they will be *trialled* over an unspecified location in the @entity19 next year
drones could be fully operational and *deployed* within five years
