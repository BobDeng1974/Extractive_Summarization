by @entity1 reporter last updated at 11:58 pm on 5th july 2011 the son of a @entity6 officer whose men killed a @entity8 captain in hand - to - hand fighting in the @entity10 has traced the relatives of the dead man nearly 100 years later			1
a yellowing troop newspaper led the son of @entity15 to the family of captain @entity17 who died in 1918 in the @entity19 region of @entity8			1
@entity20 , 78 , is proud to have discovered and befriended the family of the man his father met in combat , he told @entity6 's @entity25 magazine this week			2
a yellowing troop newspaper led the son of @entity15 to the family of captain @entity17 who died in 1918 in the @entity19 region of @entity8 during the bloody @entity10 conflict ( file picture ) the newspaper article was among the possessions of his father			1
a military correspondent described how lieutenant @entity34 's platoon came across a @entity8 outpost in a wood in southern @entity37 in the summer of 1918			1
' the patrol decided to take up the fight , ' said the article			2
' it had been lying in wait when it heard laughter and loud voices			2
' every nerve was strained			2
nearer , nearer - and then the @entity6 leaped out			2
the lieutenant shot one and seized another by the throat with the intention of taking him alive			1
' but the @entity8 was strong			1
lt. @entity34 grappled with him but was losing the struggle until one of his men put a bullet in his head , the report went on			1
for years this fading relic of the ' war to end all wars ' lay in a suitcase			2
when lt. @entity34 died in 1977 his widow passed it on to her daughter and ten years ago it came into the possession of his son @entity71 at his home in @entity74			2
also inside the suitcase were two religious medals , a metal plaque and a leather cigarette holder			2
upon examining the metal plaque more closely @entity71 saw it bore the inscription : ' @entity82 , @entity83			0
' these were the souvenirs of war that @entity15 brought back to @entity6 with him			0
his victim on june 5 1918 was listed as missing and , two years later , declared dead ' fighting the enemy '			0
@entity88 was a lawyer when he was called up , a father of two daughters , a holder of the @entity92			0
he was twice wounded in combat before he fell			0
his grave was found after the war and his widow transferred his body back to the @entity83 for burial			0
@entity15 's victim on june 5 1918 was listed as missing and , two years later , declared dead ' fighting the enemy ' @entity20 said his father , like many fathers , never spoke about the war which cost nine million soldiers their lives			0
' we had a drive around @entity37 in 1971 , ' he said , ' and he pointed out many things , about the way the vegetation had changed			1
' but he did not describe the horrors of the trenches or the comradeship , the fear , the disease and constant knife - edge existence of front - line troops			0
this gnawed at @entity20 and , the day he found the possessions of @entity17 , he vowed to do something about it			1
using the @entity121 , he looked up the name of the town of @entity83 and , using his best schoolboy @entity8 , penned a letter to the mayor			1
' permit me to submit a little everyday affair to you , ' he wrote , describing the events that led him to write to her			0
' if you can communicate to me the whereabouts of the family of captain @entity17 so i can make contact i would be most grateful			1
' the family was well known in @entity83 , the house of the dead captain still in the possession of his heirs			1
the letter was forwarded to @entity144 businessman @entity143 , a grandchild of @entity17 and , together with his cousin , the only survivors of the family			1
@entity143 , 68 , said he was ' electrified ' by the letter but then began to have second thoughts ; the @entity8 - @entity6 relationship , scarred by three wars - beginning with the 1870 @entity154 - @entity153 conflict and ending with @entity155 - has never been easy			1
' how should i have taken it ? ' he said			0
' was this project generous , sympathetic , courageous ? i did n't know			0
' but then something happened which made him opt to see the son of the man who killed his grandfather			0
he learned he was to become the grandfather of a @entity8 - @entity6 child ; his son @entity166 is married to a @entity6 woman			1
' i saw it as a moving indication , ' he said			0
' i felt the coincidence of history as deeply symbolic moment			0
' in a meeting at his apartment in @entity74 , @entity20 handed over the possessions of captain @entity17 to his family over coffee and cake			1
@entity181 said he felt like all the animosity between two tribes who lived on opposite sides of the @entity186 ' vanished '			0
' we made our peace with history , ' said ms. @entity190			0
' i am glad i came			0

captain @entity17 was *ambushed* and shot in the head at @entity8 outpost in southern @entity37
