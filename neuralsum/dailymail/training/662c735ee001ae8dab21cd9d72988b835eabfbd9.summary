by @entity0 published : 17:01 est , 3 november 2012 updated : 18:56 est , 3 november 2012 @entity1 and @entity2 both had good jobs , a house in a desirable area and a comfortable lifestyle			1
so what made them exchange all that for the chaos that comes with renovating an old property – and sharing it with live - in builders ? the answer is a derelict windmill in @entity16 near @entity17 , @entity18 , which @entity1 spotted while browsing the internet			1
at the time the @entity20 had not even decided to move from their home in @entity22 , @entity23 , let alone relocate to @entity18			0
but @entity1 , who had been working as a restaurant manager in @entity25 , fancied a change of pace and the couple could see the benefits of having more space for their five - year - old twins @entity33 and @entity34			1
change of pace : @entity2 and @entity36 fell in love with @entity38 in @entity16 and decided to do it up to live a rural life for @entity2 , 44 , an air hostess based at @entity41 , moving to @entity18 presented the prospect of a very long commute			1
however , after visiting the property just once , the couple fell in love with it , and in 2005 they bought @entity38 , complete with two - and - half acres of land , for £ 315,000			1
the property comprises a mill house and an adjoining @entity52 listed tower			0
both needed a lot of updating – especially the tower , which had n’t been used for nearly 100 years except by nesting birds			2
to complicate matters further , the @entity60 ’ house in @entity22 took a long time to sell , which meant the couple had to borrow the deposit for the mill and rent their old home until they found a buyer			2
during one stage of the building work at their new property , the @entity20 found themselves living in the four - bedroom mill house with their builders			0
the team knocked out walls to transform four small rooms into a large open - plan kitchen and living space			0
new bathrooms were also added			0
the @entity81 did not have a kitchen for three months , so meals were cooked on a camping stove , and the dishes were rinsed in the shower			0
as a tidy person , @entity2 hated the chaos of living with builders , and confesses she was unprepared for all the upheaval			1
renovated : the @entity20 in their living room , complete with the old millstone @entity1 , 47 , who gave up his restaurant job , did as much of the work as he could himself , including removing all the windows to repair broken panes before refitting them			1
but when a firm came to sandblast the interior walls to take them back to the original @entity101 red brick , they failed to cover the windows , destroying all @entity1 ’s hard work			1
the tower ’s ground floor has now been turned into a formal dining room with a circular table			0
the floor above is a games room and there are bedrooms on the next three floors			0
the final two floors have been transformed into a gallery with views over the surrounding countryside			0
the ground - floor dining room has underfloor heating , but the tower ’s listed status meant it was not possible to plumb in bathrooms			0
instead , a glass walkway from the first floor of the tower links it to the house and its three bathrooms			0
in the winter , the upper floors of the tower are heated with plug - in oil radiators			0
it took nearly two years , but the work was finished in time for @entity2 ’s 40th birthday party at the end of 2007			1
the improvements cost the @entity20 about £ 150,000			0
they are delighted with what they ’ve achieved , although @entity2 admits there were times when she would have gladly scrapped the entire project			1
‘ i would remember back to when we lived in @entity22 and had two good salaries , a comfortable house and a settled life , and wondered what on earth we were doing , ’ she says			0
the @entity20 soon realised they had the ideal property to rent out and began letting @entity38 as a holiday home in 2008 when they were away			2
then , in july 2008 , @entity2 spotted a farmhouse in nearby @entity150			2
the @entity81 raised the money to buy it and moved out of @entity38 , enabling them to rent it all year round			1
@entity38 , which now has seven bedrooms and three bathrooms and sleeps 15 , has proved a big hit as a holiday let			2
and with @entity1 ’s new private chef service offering holidaymakers gourmet meals , the property earns the couple £ 100,000 a year			1
‘ we do everything ourselves – we want everything to be perfect , ’ says @entity2			2
@entity38 costs from £ 2,500 a week through holidaylettings.co.uk			1

@entity1 and @entity2 upped sticks and moved into a derelict windmill
after seven years in @entity38 they couple now make £ 100,000 a year renting it out to holidaymakers
