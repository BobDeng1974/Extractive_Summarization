@entity0 is set to unleash @entity2 ’s young stars on @entity3 2014 by announcing an exciting @entity5 squad tomorrow that is expected to include @entity7 ’s @entity6			1
with @entity15 ’s @entity14 , @entity9 ’s @entity8 and @entity10 , and @entity12 ’s @entity11 and @entity13 all set to make the cut as well , there will be a clutch of young and relatively inexperienced players in the @entity5 squad for this summer			1
@entity6 , 20 , looks to be in , although @entity0 is leaving the biggest selection dilemma — whether to go for @entity15 ’s 18 - year - old prodigy , @entity23 , or 33 - year - old @entity25 veteran @entity24 — until the last minute			1
bright future : @entity7 's @entity6 appears to have earned himself a place in @entity2 's @entity5 squad @entity3 bound ? @entity10 ( left ) and @entity23 ( right ) could both be on the plane to @entity30 talent : @entity8 , pictured here in action against @entity34 , has shone for @entity9 this season @entity23 is more likely to get the nod and that would represent an even bolder statement of faith in the future			1
@entity7 ’s @entity40 , who is 19 , @entity42 ’s @entity41 ( 22 ) and @entity9 ’s @entity43 ( 21 ) are being considered as stand - by players , while 32 - year - old @entity45 , of @entity46 , looks as though he will be the major casualty , just failing to make the 23 - man squad			1
the rise this season of @entity9 and @entity15 , two teams playing superb attacking football with young @entity54 players integral to their success , has been welcomed by critics			0
@entity57 , a former @entity2 captain and the @entity59 winner at @entity60 in 1986 , said : ‘ six months ago we thought , “ oh , we ’re really struggling ”			2
but since then @entity62 has proved to be a top - class scorer with a bit of confidence or arrogance			0
catching the eye : @entity15 's @entity14 has impressed in his three caps for @entity2 young gun : @entity13 ( right ) is hoping to prove his fitness before @entity2 depart for their @entity72 training camp on the run : @entity11 should be fit for selection after breaking his foot against @entity34 in march @entity0 's choice for first game vs @entity78 ' you ’ve got @entity14 , who can play in midfield or as one of two wide players , @entity8 , who is a tremendously exciting young talent , and @entity6 and @entity10			1
‘ a lot of credit must go to @entity87 at @entity9 and @entity88 at @entity15			0
' they have given the players belief and told them how good they are , instead of telling them what is wrong with their game			0
and it has had a really good effect , because they can all play			0
’ former @entity2 captain @entity100 believes @entity6 has the ability to repeat the impact his own strike partner — then just 18 — had at the @entity104 in @entity105			2
‘ it has echoes of @entity108 in ’ 98 and the way he was put on to that stage — he could produce something like @entity45 did in @entity105 , ’ said @entity100			2
one young player likely to be disappointed is @entity114 defender @entity113			0
@entity2 medics are due to visit @entity114 today to make a final assessment on his pelvic injury and it is thought unlikely he will be picked			0
but @entity46 ’s @entity119 may be given the benefit of the doubt			0
his shoulder ligament damage looks as though it will have healed by @entity2 ’s opening game against @entity78 on june 14			2
been there , done that : @entity126 will be one of @entity0 's most experienced players in @entity3 veterans : @entity129 ( left ) should be included in the final squad , but @entity24 ( right ) might miss out captain fantastic : @entity132 , now 33 , will skipper the @entity2 in @entity30 more to come : @entity100 believes @entity7 starlet @entity6 could shine like @entity108 did at the @entity104 decision time : @entity2 boss @entity0 will name his 23 - man squad for @entity3 on monday danger man : @entity62 ( centre ) , pictured here celebrating his goal against @entity34 , will be one of @entity0 's main attacking threats versatile : @entity0 is a fan of @entity140 's ability to play out wide and through the middle			1
