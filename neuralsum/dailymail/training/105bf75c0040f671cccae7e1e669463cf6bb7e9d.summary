football fans were left shocked after the clip - which showed a computer - animated chimpanzee viciously shooting a man with a machine gun - was screened during a half - time ad - break			1
the trailer for the new film was shown after the 9pm ' watershed ' , but upset viewers said they had let youngsters stay up late to watch @entity18 play @entity19 and thought the advert was ' inappropriate '			1
many also took to @entity33 to criticise the channel for screening the trailer			0
mother @entity36 posted : ' @entity37 at @ @entity2 for shocking my children ( and me ) last night			0
after 9pm maybe , but during the football ? ? poor show			0
' @entity42 tweeted : ' is it me ? i thought the 1st promo ad on @ @entity2 was completely inappropriate & unacceptable			0
kids watching @entity47 ! ' and @entity48 wrote : ' just seen an ape gun down a man in cold blood in an advert mid-football			1
i know it 's post 9pm but that 's horribly misjudged and awful ! ' in the clip , the monkey is shown performing acrobatics as it enters a room where two armed men are sitting on a sofa			0
after drinking with them and smiling , the animal suddenly turns angry , picking up a machine gun and firing at one of the men , killing him			0
the advert ends with the ape pointing the gun at the other man , who is shown pleading with the creature to spare him			1
the advert encouraged viewers to go on @entity33 and give their opinions on what they had seen but the stunt backfired when many hit out at @entity2 for screening the trailer when children were watching many website users said the violent images of a murderous chimpanzee would give them nightmares some suggested the footage glamourised guns and should have been banned under advertising guidelines and one woman said her child had difficulty sleeping after unwittingly seeing the commercial			2
but other website users backed @entity2 for showing the advert , joking that it was more exciting than the football , which remained nil - nil for 120 minutes before @entity19 won on a penalty shoot - out			2
a spokesman for the @entity30 said today : ' i can confirm that we 've received around 100 complaints overnight about the tv ad for the film @entity4 , which appeared on @entity2 yesterday at around 10pm			1
' complainants are concerned that the ad shows an ape grabbing a gun and shooting a man with it , during the broadcast of the @entity6 semi-finals , which children would have been watching			1
' we 're logging these complaints , we 'll access them before making a decision as to whether we will investigate or not			0
' @entity2 have yet to comment on the controversy			0
the trailer was part of a huge publicity campaign ahead of the film 's release in cinemas on thursday , 19 july			2
