by @entity0 published : 08:01 est , 24 february 2013 updated : 08:16 est , 24 february 2013 a horse that got stuck in a sink hole full of mud had to be rescued by firefighters who needed a tractor and mechanical digger to pull him to safety			1
@entity9 the horse got bogged down in the mud after falling into the 10ft deep and 20ft wide hole which opened up after recent heavy rain in @entity13 , @entity14			1
his attempts to escape the hole at @entity18 only made the situation worse as he had churned the surface water into a mud pit			2
rescue : firefighters pull @entity9 the horse from the mud filled pit at @entity13 in @entity14 after he got stuck stuck in the mud : the animal had fallen into the hole which had opened up after recent heavy rainfall distressed : the horse had to be sedated by a local vet while firefighters used a @entity34 and a tractor to pull him out of the hole the animal was so exhausted that he had to be sedated and a fire crew from @entity13 and a specialist rescue team from @entity41 , @entity42 , had to haul him out			1
@entity43 said : ' i 've seen horses trapped in ditches before but never in a sink hole			0
' there was a line of them that had opened up and @entity9 got trapped after falling in			2
' his back legs were stuck fast			0
' he 'd been there an our by the time the fire service arrived			0
joint effort : it took a fire crew from @entity14 and a specialist rescue team from @entity42 to free @entity9 caked in mud : the horse was covered in mud after his attempts to climb up the hole 's steep banks saw him churn surface water into a muddy bog heavy work : the @entity71 staff used a mechanical digger to make a slope from the ditch to pull @entity9 out tired : vets tend to the animal which was exhausted following his attempts to escape the hole ' and it was another two hours before he was out			1
so it was some ordeal			0
' the @entity71 staff used a mechanical digger to make a slope from the ditch to pull @entity9 out			2
they then used lines to secure the horse before pulling him out of the hole using a landrover and a tractor			0
despite his ordeal @entity9 was back on his feet shortly afterwards seemingly none the worse for wear			1
@entity43 added : ' apart from the shock and trauma of what he went through and some mud in his eyes he was fine			0
' safer ground : @entity9 the horse gets to his feet again after a sedative administered in a bid to help him relax wears off no harm done : aside from a bit of mud and tiredness , @entity9 was back on his feet fairly soon after he was pulled from the hole , showing no adverse effects from his ordeal happy ending : @entity9 the horse is reunited with owner @entity113 after getting stuck fast in a deep , natural sink hole full of mud			1

@entity9 the horse got stuck in @entity13 , @entity14
fire crews from both @entity14 and @entity42 had to rescue him
aside from being covered in mud , @entity9 was *unharmed* by his ordeal
