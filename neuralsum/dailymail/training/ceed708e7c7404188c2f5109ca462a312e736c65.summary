by @entity0 published : 13:03 est , 13 june 2013 updated : 12:51 est , 14 june 2013 the 380 - million - year - old fossils of pre-historic fish could help scientists explain how the modern - day ' six pack ’ evolved			1
@entity7 researchers found that the ' miraculously preserved ’ placoderm fish from north west @entity9 had well - developed powerful abdominal muscles ' not unlike the human equivalents displayed on the beaches of the world every summer '			1
and this gives scientist a rare opportunity to understand how modern - day abs have developed			2
rare soft tissue samples have been found by @entity7 scientists in the fossils of fish from the @entity22			1
they show that the jawed fishes had strong neck and abdominal muscles @entity27 comes from the @entity28 for ' plate - skinned ' they are an extinct class of prehistoric fish which lived around 400 million years ago - from the @entity32 to the end of the @entity34			2
their head and thorax were covered by articulated armoured plates and the rest of the body was scaled or naked , depending on the species			0
placoderms were among the first jawed fish and their jaws are thought to have evolved from their gill arches			0
a 380 - million - year - old fossil of one species represents the oldest known example of live birth			0
the fish were found in the @entity22 , a sedimentary rock formation in the @entity52 of north - western @entity9			2
the area is renowned for being a trove of preserved fossil fishes including the placoderms - an extinct group that includes some of the earliest jawed fishes			0
researchers from @entity60 in @entity7 made this latest discovery and found that the muscle and soft tissue were well preserved			1
the strong abdominal muscles that @entity7 scientists believe would have featured in the jawed fish of the @entity9 @entity22 are ' not unlike ' those seen in modern - day human six - packs , such as @entity68 's in @entity71 film @entity69 , pictured bones and teeth fossilise far more easily than soft tissues and are usually the only traces of the animal that remain			1
this makes the rare fossil localities that preserve soft tissues - such as the one discovered by the @entity7 university - all the more valuable			2
the team , led by professor @entity81 noticed that the fish would have had a well - developed neck musculature as well as powerful abdominal muscles			1
living fish , by contrast , usually have a rather simple body musculature without such specialisations			1
@entity81 said : ' this [ discovery ] shows that vertebrates developed a sophisticated musculature much earlier than we had thought			0
' it also cautions against thinking that we can interpret fossil organisms simply by metaphorically draping their skeletons in the soft tissues of living relatives			0
' @entity9 researchers had previously discovered that these fossils contained soft tissue			1
now with the help of @entity81 's team and the @entity106 synchrotron in @entity107 , @entity108 , they have managed to resconstruct the musulcature of the fish			0
an artist 's impression of what the placoderm fish that the @entity9 fossils came from would have looked like			2
placoderms were among the first jawed fish and their jaws are thought to have evolved from their gill arches			0
their name comes from the @entity28 for ' plate - skinned '			0

rare soft tissue taken from fish fossils found in north west @entity9 show that the fish had powerful abdominal muscles
@entity7 scientists claim that these are not unlike those muscles found in human six packs
living fish have simple body musculature meaning scientists can use this discovery to track how abs *changed* and evolved
