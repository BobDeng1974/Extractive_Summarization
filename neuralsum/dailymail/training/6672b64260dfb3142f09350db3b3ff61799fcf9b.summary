internet shoppers could soon be hit with a new sales tax , making online purchases up to 11 per cent more expensive			1
@entity3 is considering new legislation that would allow states to force sales tax on internet purchases , which would help make up states ' budget shortfalls			1
meanwhile @entity10 , the world 's largest internet retailer , is making deals with individual states to collect sales taxes regardless of what @entity3 decides			1
new tax : internet shoppers are likely to be hit with a new sales - tax as the proposal boasts strong support from both @entity21 and @entity23 senators currently , online shoppers enjoy a 5 to 10 per cent ‘ discount ’ thanks to no sales - tax , which is implemented on goods brought at bricks - and - mortar stores			1

the amount of sales tax applied to online goods will vary according to individual state ’s tax codes and sales tax rates , which range from less than 1 per cent to more than 10 per cent			2
the internet sales tax in each state will be set at the same amount as the state 's sales tax			2
due to the different rates , @entity46 will pay about $ 1.8 billion more while @entity45 will shell out $ 4.2 billion			0
the average @entity71 online shopper will soon be spending $ 1,700 annually so the new tax will cost each person approximately $ 125 every year , according to @entity74 , reported @entity76 news			0
costly : the average @entity71 online shopper will soon be spending $ 1,700 annually so the new tax will cost each person approximately $ 125 every year as supporters of the legislation have keenly pointed out , adding a sales tax to online purchases will balance out the playing field for retailers where internet shopping has threatened or killed off smaller , independent bricks - and - mortar stores			2
the @entity31 would require online retailers to collect and pay sales taxes to states even where they have no physical presence			1
this list of @entity95 's sales taxes , from lowest to highest , includes any local surtaxes			0

the internet sales tax proposal , which boasts bipartisan support , has gained momentum recently with a @entity154 hearing on wednesday			2
@entity10 's vice president @entity155 came out in support of the bill on wednesday night as the world ’s largest internet retailer gradually adds sales taxes across the nation			0
@entity10 is establishing a physical presence in more states by building warehouses			0
this physical presence means @entity10 customers will be charged with sales tax regardless of whether new legislation is passed so the company has less reason to fight internet sales tax , as it used to			1
@entity171 have already starting paying it and , in september , @entity45 residents will also be taxed			0
by next year , ten states will be taxed , reported @entity76			0
furthermore , because internet retailers will potentially have to spend time and resources complying to different state ’s tax codes they may well rise the prices of goods to cover this extra work			0
although consumers presently do not pay a sales tax on online purchases they are meant to pay a ‘ use tax ’ later to the state			1
however , hardly anyone knows about or pays this ‘ use tax ’ , which is set at the same rate as the state ’s sales tax , and it is rarely enforced			0
this ‘ use tax ’ means supporters of the proposal can argue that the legislation allows for collection of money the state is already owed			0
the onus on paying the tax is transferred from the customer to the retailer where the businesses would have to file a tax return for every state they sell in and could be subject to audits in those states .			0
