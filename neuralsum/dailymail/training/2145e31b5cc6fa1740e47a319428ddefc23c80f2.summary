she said : ‘ i got bullied badly - at school i was called a “ beardo ” and things like “ shemale ” and “ sheman ”			2
i can laugh about it now , but back then it affected me so badly that i began to self - harm because it felt better than all the abuse i was getting			2
‘ i 'd talk to people with a hand over my face and i wore baggy , tomboy clothes to cover up the hair on my chest and arms			1
‘ i did n't want to go outside my house because i could n't take the stares from strangers so i 'd lock myself in my room			2

her parents have come to terms with her decision - and her brother @entity135 , 18 , is her biggest supporter			0
she said : ‘ it was incredibly daunting going outside because people would stare more than ever			0
at first i was angry but i realised that they did n't understand and were probably too afraid to ask me so i just decided to smile back			1
’ but miss @entity1 has struggled to get a job and even shaved off her beard at the age of 17 after pressure from members of her extended family			1
she said : ‘ i removed my beard once during a really low moment but when i 'd done it all i could do was cry because i did n't feel like myself without my beard			0
‘ my brother was actually the one person who was completely shocked by what i had done - he hugged me and said i had looked so beautiful with my beard , he did n't understand why i had done it			0
’ she added : ‘ it was from that point that i thought i 'm never going to remove it ever again			0

some ask me what my beard is and i joke it 's a @entity178 costume			2
some even ask me where i buy it and i just say “ @entity180 ”			0
