@entity0 has backed @entity1 to handle the pressure of carrying @entity4 ’s assault on the top four			1
the 21 - year - old has had a stunning season , netting 15 goals and , significantly , has been the club ’s driving force in a run of seven games unbeaten in all competitions			2
he ’s scored six goals in that run and played a major role in leading @entity4 to fifth in the @entity17			1
with an @entity20 call up likely , the challenge for the striker will now be managing expectation s. @entity4 striker @entity1 is mature enough to handle the pressure this season , says @entity24 the new @entity4 manager has been credited with giving @entity1 the chance he deserved up front this season but @entity0 insisted on friday he has no concerns about @entity1 enduring the pressure of his success			1
he said : ‘ @entity1 is young and he can handle this moment			1
yes , i think he is mature			2
he is young but mature and the process was the right process to arrive in this moment			0
i think @entity1 is clever and he knows how to manage the pressure			2
’ the subject of pressure and the wider team ’s mental toughness has been prominent in @entity0 ’s debut season			1
their abject record against leading sides was held up as an example of that fragility , though the 5 - 3 demolition of @entity45 will surely go some way to instilling confidence in the side			0
@entity1 ( tussling with @entity49 ) has proven he possesses the sort of physical attributes to succeed @entity52 ( right , pictured on @entity53 ) is still injured and wo n't play against @entity54 @entity0 , whose side face @entity54 on saturday , believes that win could prove essential in the chase for a @entity59 spot			1
he said : ‘ it is important to stop this idea			0
we must now believe we can beat sides like @entity45			0
it was more than just one victory			0
it was a victory for getting belief into our tactics and the way we want to play			0
’ it remains to be seen how active @entity4 are in the transfer market this month			1
the signs are that there will be movement , having signed @entity76 ’s head of recruitment @entity77 , but @entity0 attempted to play down those prospects			2
he said : ‘ we are happy with our squad and our players			0
i do n’t think there will be many changes			0
there are many rumours in this period but we do n’t comment			0
’ @entity86 and @entity52 are both injured and will not face @entity54 .			1
