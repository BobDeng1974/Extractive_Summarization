it is the eerie old church that featured in @entity2 ’s gothic novel dracula			1
now @entity3 ’s in @entity4 has become the scene of real horror after human bones began to emerge from their centuries - old graves			1
the grisly discovery was made when the church cemetery , which dates to @entity12 , began to subside and fall down the cliff last month following heavy rain			1
grave danger : human bones have crumbled off the side of the cliff where @entity19 , in @entity4 , stands ruin : it is feared the legendary @entity19 in @entity4 could fall if the cliff face crumbles away many of the ancient graves were exposed – and among the debris tumbling on to the buildings below were a number of human bones , thought to be at least a century old			1
@entity2 was inspired to use the cemetery – which has been closed to the public since 1865 – as the backdrop for some of @entity33 ’s horror scenes after visiting the @entity35 town in the 1890s			1
resident @entity37 , 56 , told how he found several bones in the backyard of his kipper smokehouse , which sits under the cliff			2
he said : ‘ when the subsidence began i went out and found a few pieces of bone			0
they ’d been buried for @entity47 knows how many years because they were soft and yellow from being in the soil			0
' i managed to identify one hip bone , two pieces of skull and a large bone that looked like it was part of a leg			0
‘ it ’s quite sad picking that sort of thing up , i expect the people who buried them thought they ’d be there for ever			0
debris : more cracks have appeared in the cliff face this week following heavy rainfall in @entity4 problems : reverend @entity70 @entity69 said the church will have to use money earmarked for repairs to pay for the landslide recovery work historic : in 2000 @entity19 in @entity4 experienced more landslides close to the edge of the graveyard iconic : @entity3 's church featured in @entity2 's classic novel @entity33 goths who flocked to the graveyard because of its links to @entity33 were banned from the churchyard in 2011 horror : @entity86 in the 1958 horror film dracula which was inspired by the novel by @entity2 ( right ) ‘ it could have even been one of my relatives , as my family have been here since the early 1800s			1
’ the bones were collected soon afterwards by church staff and have since been reburied in a more stable spot			2
it is not known who the bones belonged to , as many of the headstones in the cemetery have been moved around over the centuries			2
@entity3 ’s @entity70 @entity69 said : ‘ the cemetery has been closed for over a century , so if any graves are exposed it ’s only bones			2
if anything is exposed we re-inter them			0
’ the landslide has been blamed on a drainage pipe which became damaged and fell away			0
this meant recent heavy rainfall saturated the soil , which then began to fall			0
@entity113 added : ‘ the church has been trying to muck in to get things done and we have had a civil engineer working to sort it out			0
‘ they ’ve been trying to find where the water was coming from and making the cliff edge more secure			2
’ as @entity2 sat at his desk overlooking the seaside town of @entity126 in 1890 he noticed the huge number of bats flying around @entity19			1
perched on top of a cliff @entity3 's , with its rows upon rows of tombstones , looked out onto the stormy @entity134			2
it was the atmospheric surroundings of @entity4 and @entity19 which would inspire him to write the classic gothic novel @entity33 published in 1897			1
the writer happened to be staying in the town trying to decide whether it would be suitable for a family holiday			2
however , it became the perfect backdrop for his book			0
he wrote : ' for a moment or two i could see nothing , as the shadow of a cloud obscured @entity19			0
' then as the cloud passed i could see the ruins of the @entity154 coming into view ; and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as a sword - cut moved along , the church and churchyard became gradually visible ... ' it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind the seat where the white figure shone , and bent over it			0
what it was , whether man or beast , i could not tell			0
' @entity2 's @entity33 is shipwrecked off the @entity35 coast			1
he comes ashore in the guise of a black dog and wreaks havoc on the town			0
prince @entity177 , from @entity178 and known for his bloodthirsty reputation , is thought to have been the inspiration for @entity2 's character @entity33			1
one of the characters , @entity183 , keeps a journal containing detailed descriptions of @entity4 and those areas frequented by @entity33			1
a spokesman for @entity188 said : ‘ the cliff is not the responsibility of the council because it is private land and there is no immediate danger to life or property			0
‘ we have written to the church and have made them aware of their obligations as landowners			0
’ @entity33 , published in 1897 , tells the story of the vampire count ’s attempt to relocate from @entity178 to @entity206 , leaving a trail of dead in his wake , with his ship running aground in @entity4 in a storm			1
@entity2 hit upon the idea of the count while reading a history book at @entity214 , and made @entity3 ’s part of the story after being struck by the way the bats circled the building			1
in one scene , the count appears in the church cemetery with his young victim @entity223			0
many visitors to @entity4 still ask about @entity33 ’s grave , forgetting he is a work of fiction			1
the cemetery , which inspired @entity2 when writing his classic novel @entity33 , is closed to the public the future of the historic graveyard at @entity19 in @entity4 is in danger after the nearby cliff began crumbling away human bones were discovered after the landslide at @entity19 which took place last month			1
