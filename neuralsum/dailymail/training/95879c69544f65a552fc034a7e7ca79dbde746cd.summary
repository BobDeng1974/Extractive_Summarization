precious , a 6 - year - old toy yorkie , got loose from owner @entity11 , 72 , while she was reading the newspaper in front of her home and ran down their @entity17 , @entity16 street			1
he began barking at @entity11 ’s neighbor @entity19 and his much larger @entity20 when @entity19 launched him four feet into the air with a swift kick and then crushed him under his boots			1
it actually reminded me of if you were going to step on a bug			0
’ while they both agree that @entity19 stepped on the dog , @entity19 claims he did so on accident			2
but @entity28 ’s injures might tell a different tale			0
aggrieved : @entity11 says neighbor @entity19 kicked her yorkie and stomped her with both feet but police gave her a citation , not @entity19 ‘ i picked her up			1
she was crying , screaming , making these terrible noises , ’ @entity11 said			2
‘ [ she was ] having trouble breathing and he said to me : @entity11 , you need to have better control of your dog			2
’ @entity28 was taken to veterinarians with lung and brain injuries and later died			0
@entity19 also blamed @entity11 when he , too , was interviewed by @entity33			1
‘ it was an extremely unfortunate incident ’ he said			0
‘ but if ms. @entity11 had had her dog on a leash , her dog would n't have attacked my dog , would n't have attempted to bite my dog and frankly you and i would n't even be talking today			2
’ did n't mean to : @entity19 says @entity28 was a nuisance dog and does not deny stomping her , but says it was an accident police investigated the incident , reports @entity69 , and they too are blaming the aggrieved @entity11			1
@entity17 police issued her citations for not having a license , not having her dog on a leash , and nuisance violation			0

‘ @entity86 was little , sweet … loving , ’ @entity11 said			0
‘ she was my baby			0
