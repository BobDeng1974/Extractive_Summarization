as @entity1 continues its ' @entity3 ' campaign in an attempt to rid the game of grappling defenders and shirt - pulling in the area , we highlight the main talking points from @entity10 's match against @entity11 on monday night			2
@entity10 0 - 0 @entity11 while @entity10 's home clash was rather uneventful in terms of goal - mouth action , there were still a number of talking points from the game			1
after @entity21 ' penalty miss in the first half for the @entity10 , the hosts should have had another in the second half after a clear foul on @entity10 striker @entity26			2
the @entity28 international appeared to be bundled down in the area by @entity11 midfielder @entity30 on 62 minutes			1
what made the incident even more bizarre was the fact the 27 - year - old had been previously warned twice by referee @entity35 about making contact in the area			0
but despite those warnings he could n't resist pulling back the forward again from the corner that followed , with @entity26 falling into the @entity11 goal - but no penalty was awarded			0
@entity11 midfielder @entity30 ( left ) clearly has both hands on @entity10 striker @entity26 ( right ) in the area @entity30 appears to make clear contact with @entity26 inside the area just after the half mark at @entity50 @entity26 is on the verge of falling inside the area with @entity30 clearly all over him with both of his arms @entity30 proved to be a big part of a resilient @entity11 display , with the visitors grinding out a hard - fought point at @entity50			1
after the game manager @entity58 admitted the @entity61 midfielder plays a similar role to that of @entity65 's midfield general @entity64 - who starred under @entity66 at @entity67 last season			0
neither side could make the breakthrough , with the result much more pleasing for @entity11 manager @entity58 rather than @entity10 boss @entity72 .			0

@entity11 midfielder @entity30 appeared to make clear contact with @entity26 inside the box
