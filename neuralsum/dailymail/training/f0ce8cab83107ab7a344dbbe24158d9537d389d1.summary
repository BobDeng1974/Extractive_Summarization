the country of @entity1 is a tropical paradise in the @entity4 region of the @entity5 with an average temperature of 77 degrees @entity7 in the winter months and precisely zero snowfall			2
but , thanks to a couple of carpetbagging amateur skiers who live in @entity14 , it now has an @entity16 cross-country ski team for the first time ever			1
however , their fraudulent scheme has come crashing spectacularly down around them			0
it has been revealed that the two founding members of @entity1 's @entity16 team , @entity24 and his wife , @entity25 , in their late - 40s , ' scammed the @entity16 and the press ' with reportedly fictitious tales about the backgrounds of its athletes - namely themselves			1
they invented phony athletic accomplishments to pad their sports backgrounds and then ' donated ' nearly $ 200,000 to their host country in order to gain citizenship to qualify for its @entity16 team , according to the sports website @entity39			1
at one point , ms @entity25 was accused of bribing @entity16 officials on behalf of her then - employer , @entity42			1
delegation : @entity1 's @entity16 delegation consisted of @entity24 and his wife @entity25 , both of whom live in @entity14 ( pictured at the opening ceremony ) @entity1 : @entity1 is a tiny , tropical island in the @entity5 - thousands of miles away from the hometowns of its two - member @entity16 team olympians : @entity25 did n't show up to her 10k race and @entity24 did n't make it to the first checkpoint in the men 's 15k the couple are the lone members of @entity1 's @entity16 team , which may seem odd considering @entity60 originally is from @entity61 , @entity62 , and @entity25 is an @entity64 national currently residing with @entity24 in a ' mountain palace ' in @entity14			1
the many myths about the @entity16 couple that have been a source for ' puffy ' media pieces during the @entity70 , however , were outed by longtime sports journalist @entity71 in a lengthy report for @entity39			2
according to the report , the couple took advantage of what the tiny nation sells on its website as ' economic citizenship , ' which means any married couple can become a @entity1 citizen if they deposit $ 175,000 ' into the appropriate account at the @entity84 of @entity1			2
' another $ 3,530 must then be paid to the @entity85 for fees and tariffs , and just like that you 're a citizen of @entity1 and can qualify to form the tropical country 's previously non-existent @entity16 team			1
according to @entity92 , the couple makes a compelling case for ' closing the eligibility loopholes that allow moneyed pranksters to dress up as @entity52			0
' @entity25 , at 48 years old , is the oldest @entity16 cross-country skier in @entity16 history by seven years			2
she did n't even show up for the @entity97 - the only one of the 76 racers who did n't make it to the starting line			0
@entity102 is right : the couple paid nearly $ 200,000 to become citizens of @entity1 in order to create its first - ever @entity16 team for his part , @entity24 , 47 , started the 15k @entity108 , but quit after a few hundred meters			1
he was the only participant who did n't make it to at least the first checkpoint			0
in a fawning piece by the @entity115 , which lamented the loss of an ' @entity16 fairytale ' created by the couple who were granted citizenship after helping to build a children 's hospital in @entity1 ' , ms @entity25 detailed the reasons why neither was able to compete			1
she said they both missed their events after being admitted to the hospital the day after the opening ceremony			0
ms @entity25 told the publication her husband had acute bacterial gastroenteritis , while she had a fall on the slopes that required three surgeries on her nose and a 36 hour intensive care stay			0
then there 's the issue of the bio for the couple that has been pounced on by fawning members of the sporting press who did n't dig quite as deep into the legitimacy of the couple 's claims as @entity92			0
the former @entity146 columnist , @entity92 describes the couple 's backgrounds as being ' full of exactly the sort of petty vanity and low - rent corruption you would expect of a middle - aged couple who bought their way into @entity16 competition			2
' of the doting media , @entity92 cites @entity159 's writeup of the @entity160 , which describes him as a ' two - time state wrestling champion ' who ' rowed for a national championship team at @entity164			0
' according to @entity92 , neither of those claims were true			0
he writes : ' @entity167 , a wrestling obsessive from @entity169 who has compiled a comprehensive history of the @entity62 state championship meets from 1962 through last year , says his records show that @entity24 ' was never ' a state titlist			0
' in fact , @entity24 's name does n't show up anywhere in @entity178 's database , which includes the top six finishers for every year in the last half - century			2
' on his blog and @entity182 page , @entity24 describes himself as a ' @entity183 as well as a three - time @entity62 @entity184			2
' @entity185 : the couple currently lives in @entity185 , @entity14 , more than 3,000 miles from the island nation they 're representing in the @entity16 as @entity92 discovered , those claims are likely untrue , as there is no record of him winning any state or city wrestling championships			2
in fact , there is no record that a ' downstate ' wrestling title even exists in @entity199 , and if it does , ' di @entity24 is the only man on the planet claiming to be a " downstate wrestling champion " â€” from anywhere , not just @entity62			1
' as for the ' national championship ' he won while rowing at @entity164 , @entity92 found that ' no boat from @entity164 won an @entity207 championship during @entity24 's years at the school			0
' @entity92 quotes @entity209 , the coach of the @entity164 crew team when @entity24 was a student at the university , as saying that while the crew team did win some honors in the years @entity1 's new winter olympian was a student , @entity24 had little to do with any of it			1
' @entity24 was n't in the boats that medaled those years , ' @entity217 told @entity92			0
scandal : @entity25 was implicated in allegations that she attempted to bribe an @entity16 official while working for @entity42 in the 1990s @entity25 's @entity16 experience dates back much further than her husband 's recent , unexpected foray into the world of competitive skiing			1
in the 1990s , @entity25 was going by her married name , @entity228 , while working as a marketing official for the @entity42 car company			1
@entity42 , at the time , was lobbying the @entity231 to have it hold the 1997 skiing world championships in @entity64			1
@entity233 , a whistle - blowing @entity234 attorney , charged members of the @entity231 with accepting payments in exchange for their votes in favor of one country over another to host the event			0
one of those @entity231 members , @entity244 - the former president of the @entity246 ski team and @entity231 voter - affirmed the claims made by @entity233 , saying ' @entity42 offered him two of the company 's cars in exchange for voting to award the event to @entity252 , @entity64 , ' according to @entity92 's report			1
carpetbaggers : @entity255 and @entity25 claim their looking to purchase a home in their new country according to @entity92 , ' the alleged perps from @entity64 were so brazen that they even gave him their business cards while telling him to call as soon as he was ready to accept the four - wheeled bribes			1
' one of the card - carrying alleged bribers who approached @entity244 was a @entity42 marketing official named @entity228			0
' @entity244 is now the general manager of a cross-country ski resort in @entity268 called @entity269			0
when told the same @entity64 woman who once tried to buy his vote when he was a member of the @entity231 is now representing a small @entity5 country in the @entity16 after apparently buying citizenship to join the @entity16 team , @entity244 apparently was shocked			1
' people do that ? ' he asked .			0

@entity24 and wife @entity25 were born in @entity61 and @entity64 , respectively
the couple paid nearly $ 200,000 to become citizens of @entity1 to be eligible to compete in the @entity16
@entity1 has never before had a @entity16 team
many of the claims di @entity24 makes in his various bios about his previous athletic prowess have proven to not be true
@entity25 was involved in a bribery scandal involving the @entity231 and her former employer , @entity64 car - maker @entity42
