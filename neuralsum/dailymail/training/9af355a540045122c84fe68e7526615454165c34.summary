by @entity0 a new hearing aid that 's attached to the head by magnets has been life - transforming for drama teacher and mother - of - four @entity6 , 37 , from @entity7 in @entity8			1
here , she talks to @entity10 about the experience ... when i was seven , i was diagnosed with glue ear in both ears - my ears were filled with fluid , which was stopping me from hearing properly			1
i had an operation to insert grommets - little plastic tubes - to drain the fluid			2
they did help , though my hearing was still poor and i needed extra lessons because it affected my school work			2
drama teacher and mother - of - four @entity6 , 37 , from @entity7 in @entity8 has a new hearing aid and the grommets kept falling out - i had three operations over four years to put them back			1
as i grew up , going out with friends was difficult			0
i had to ask people to repeat themselves and noisy places were a nightmare			0
over time , i learned to lip - read			2
but as a drama teacher , it was n't easy because the children do n't always speak clearly or look at you when they 're speaking			0
by 30 , i was still struggling			0
my husband , @entity37 , helped by speaking loudly and repeating things , but we have four boys , so the house could be incredibly noisy , with me straining to hear and turning the tv up , and the children shouting to make themselves heard			0
it seemed to be getting worse - sometimes , i would n't hear the phone or doorbell			1
once , my three - year - old dialled 999 and i did n't hear the police call back , so they turned up on the doorstep			2
@entity6 's hearing implant transmits the sound vibrations through the bone of her skull to the inner ear i worried my hearing would go completely , or my children would need me and i would n't hear			1
in 2007 , i saw my gp , who referred me to consultant ear , nose and throat surgeon @entity61 - he referred me for a hearing aid in my left ear , which was worse than the right			1
although that helped , i kept getting ear infections : mr @entity61 said the hearing aid made my ear damp and humid , encouraging bacteria			1
i kept needing antibiotics and ear drops , so only used the hearing aid while teaching - this did help to reduce the infections			1
when i next saw mr @entity61 , he said that , in fact , it was n't the glue ear causing the hearing problems for all those years ; i had otosclerosis			1
there are three tiny bones in the middle ear , just behind the ear drum , which transmit sound vibrations to the inner ear			1
@entity86 is when extra bone grows around the smallest bone , which means it ca n't move and pass on sound vibrations			1
mr @entity61 said it can be linked to raised oestrogen levels , and could have become worse during pregnancy			2
he tried to free the bone surgically , but scar tissue meant he could not proceed			2
mr @entity61 said i could have a bone - anchored hearing aid - this would transmit the sound vibrations through the bone of my skull to the inner ear , instead of via the ear canal			1
the hearing aid would be fixed by a screw into my skull			1
but i was n't keen , because i 'd read they caused infections - and did n't fancy a screw sticking out of my skin			2
in 2012 , mr @entity61 mentioned a new hearing aid implant - the part of the device that transmitted the sound vibrations to my inner ear would be surgically implanted into the bone behind my ear			1
the external sound processor and microphone , about the thickness of a £ 2 coin , would be held in place behind my ear by a magnet , which would be attracted to the magnetic end of the implant , so i could remove it to sleep or shower			1
there was less risk of infection , and i could have it done on the @entity128			0
i had the hour - long operation in january 2013			2
afterwards , the skin behind my ear was sore and swollen , so i needed painkillers			2
the swelling settled down after four weeks			0
five weeks after surgery , an audiologist put the sound processor above my left ear			1
suddenly , i heard doors closing , phones ringing and footsteps - things i 'd barely heard before			2
coming home to four lively boys was amazing			0
i could hear the tiniest sounds - and correct their pronunciation while they were learning to speak			0
@entity61 is consultant ear , nose and throat surgeon at @entity149 in @entity150			0
ten million @entity151 suffer from hearing loss			0
in many cases it is age - related , but it can also be caused by wax , glue ear , head injury , acute ear infections , or conditions such as otosclerosis , thought to affect 2 per cent of people			1
when we hear , soundwaves move through the ear canal and make the eardrum vibrate			0
the vibrations are passed via three tiny , linked bones in the middle ear to the inner ear , where they are converted to nerve impulses which are carried to the brain			1
with otosclerosis , the smallest of the three bones , shaped like a stirrup , becomes fixed and can not vibrate			0
as a result , patients often ca n't hear anything under 60 decibels , such as normal conversation			0
normal hearing detects sounds from under 20 decibels			0
hearing aids help , but can lead to ear infections			1
with otosclerosis , we can remove part of the fixed bone and replace it with an artificial link so that it moves again			0
this is usually successful but , in @entity6 's case , scar tissue prevented us from doing this			1
she was diagnosed with glue ear in both ears as a child			1
they were filled with fluid , stopping her hearing another option for hearing loss caused by a blockage or an abnormality in the ear is a bone - anchored hearing aid			1
normally , sound is transmitted through the middle ear to the inner ear - but it can also be transmitted through bone			1
with a bone - anchored hearing aid , an external sound processor is fixed onto a titanium screw implanted into the bone behind the ear			1
these work in the vast majority of cases , though a few get infections that can mean skin grows over the head of the screw so the sound processor ca n't stay in place			0
some people find the screw unattractive , and do n't like being able to feel it			0
the new @entity227 device is attached with a magnet instead - an external sound processor transmits sound to a 4 - 5cm to 5cm implant under the skin , which vibrates and sends the sound to the inner ear			1
this could help people who can not wear hearing aids , usually because of ear infections , or people born without an ear canal - but it wo n't help people with severe hearing loss because their level of hearing loss is too extreme			1
the operation carries standard risks of bleeding and infection and a small risk of puncturing the dura ( the thick membrane surrounding the brain ) , which could cause a leak of cerebrospinal fluid			0
this would need to be repaired , as it could cause meningitis			0
the percentage of people with hearing aids who do n't wear them regularly depending on whether there is enough space in the mastoid bone , behind the ear , to embed the implant , or whether we have to find a different site behind a vein behind the ear , the operation takes 45 to 90 minutes under general anaesthetic			1
i make a 5cm incision and peel back the skin and muscle to expose the bone			0
i then drill a well in the bone for the implant and screw it in place			2
once the incision has healed , at least three weeks later , the patient sees an audiologist to put the sound processor in place and switch it on			0
the implant stays in place indefinitely ; the patient changes the batteries in the external sound processor when needed			2
after around seven years , the processor will probably need replacing , as tiny parts wear out and newer models are developed			0
patients should have many years of good hearing			0
@entity292 ? ' this operation carries a small risk of bleeding and infection or of the implant failing so it needs to be taken out , ' says @entity298 , consultant ear , nose and throat surgeon at @entity302			2
' drilling into the mastoid bone carries a theoretical risk of damage to the membrane covering the brain			0
' we do n't know how @entity310 will perform long term , but we expect it to last for years			0
for the right patient , it works well and can restore hearing after years of hearing loss			0
' the operation costs £ 12,000 to £ 15,000 privately and is a similar cost to the @entity128 .			0
