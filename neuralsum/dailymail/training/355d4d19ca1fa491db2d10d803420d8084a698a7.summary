by @entity0 for the @entity1 according to the fairy tale , the test of a true princess was whether she could detect a pea hidden beneath a pile of 20 mattresses and eiderdowns			1
today , peas are out and thread counts are in			1
but what does it really mean ? technically , the term ‘ thread count ’ refers to the number of threads woven together in one square inch of fabric			1
manufacturers count them both horizontally and vertically across this little square			1
the idea is , the more threads they cram in , the more luxurious the sheet			1
yet , this is not always an exact indicator of quality			1
some manufacturers ‘ cheat ’ by counting the strands that make up an individual thread as additional threads , meaning a thread count of 600 might really be just 300 , low - quality double - ply threads			1
for example , sateen is cotton yarn woven like satin for a lustrous sheen , while percale is a closely woven thread - count of more than 200			1
@entity36 tests what the @entity52 has to offer ... @entity54 @entity55 : @entity57 cotton double fitted sheet , 100 per cent cotton , 1,000 thread sateen , £ 110 i grew up with a mother reared on rationing and devoted to keeping things for ‘ best ’ : crockery , cutlery , glasses , tablecloths and bed linen , the ‘ best ’ cupboard was packed with things that were put away and never used			1
this sheet would certainly have been consigned to her @entity74 ’s cave			2
the packaging describes @entity77 as offering fibres that are longer and finer than anything else			2
without an industrial strength magnifying glass , it is impossible to tell , but certainly the sateen cotton feels thick and sumptuous — and you ca n’t see the mattress cover through it			2
the elasticated corners are generous , which means no stretching and the pillowcases are like resting on silk			2
5/5 sleek and no ironing ! @entity93 : @entity95 cotton double fitted sheet , 100 per cent cotton , 600 thread sateen , £ 70 if you have children in the house , oversleeping is something that happens to other people			1
but this sheet could shake things up a bit			2
@entity36 ( pictured ) rated the @entity93 : @entity95 cotton double fitted sheet at 4/5 , praising it for it 's impressive non-iron finish the packaging claims it will deliver the perfect night ’s sleep — and it certainly does			1
getting out of bed was very difficult and i dreamt of going back to it even more than i usually do			2
once on , the sheet looks impressive and having a non-iron finish just adds to its appeal			2
it also has the added benefit of a 10 in overhang on the edges — which means no nasty gaps on the side , even on a deep - filled mattress			2
4/5 a @entity124 @entity125 : basic flat double sheet , 50 per cent cotton , 50 per cent polyester no thread count , £ 8 when polyester was first invented in the @entity132 , it was heralded as a miracle fibre			1
there was little it could n’t do — except convince us that it was a luxury item			2
it was always a bit scratchy and it still is			2
@entity125 ’s 50/50 cotton and polyester mix is almost transparently thin			2
no matter which way i lay , it made me itch and overheat , an unwanted extra for the menopausal woman			2
that said , the manufacturers made no claims for its slumber properties or its deluxe appeal			0
or more accurately , a dust sheet			0
but at little more than the price of a couple of cappuccinos , it seems churlish to complain			0
2/5 fit for a queen dorma : fitted double sheet , 100 per cent cotton sateen , 350 thread count , £ 23.99 sheet makers to the @entity165 and the @entity166 , @entity160 simply do n’t make sheets that are below 200 thread			1
since 1921 , they have been producing top - drawer bed linen and pride themselves on giving you that extra edge over the neighbours on the washing line			0
@entity36 says the @entity160 : fitted double sheet is fit for a @entity165 and allows coverage for even the deepest mattress the 350 thread , double sheet is one of their biggest sellers			1
it ’s not difficult to see why			0
part of their indulgent range of luxury bedding , it is fit for a @entity165 who has never knowingly wasted money			0
it is 14in deep which allows for coverage of even the deepest mattress , perhaps even two mattresses , and the pillowcases are as crisp after five nights as they are after one			1
4/5 shiny and very slippery the @entity198 : @entity200 flat double sheet , 100 per cent cotton , 300 thread sateen , £ 68 coloured bits around the borders of sheets and pillowcases have always made me anxious and the silver streaks that define the @entity200 collection fall into that category			1
like most of the sheets i was testing , it has a sateen finish , but set against the almost neon finish white dye used on this range , it gives it a reflective quality that makes the bed look like something off @entity220			0
in fact , so shiny is it that it works like a mirrored ceiling in reverse			0
the experience of sleeping was so slippery that at some point in the night i subconsciously started holding on to the edge of the bed			0
3/5 costs more than a flight to paris @entity233 : @entity236 single fitted sheet , 100 per cent cotton , 500 thread sateen , £ 140 all daughters believe they are princesses and mine is no exception , so the chance to upgrade her single bed linen to something that costs more than a flight to @entity246 was very appealing			1
@entity36 says although the £ 140 sheets from @entity233 : @entity236 are luxurious they 're not quite worth the money i approached this test with the question of wondering quite who would spend this amount of money on a single sheet			1
in fact , who would spent this amount on any sheet ? true , it does deliver a relaxed and warm night ’s slumber as the cotton is very dense , which makes it feel toasty			0
it ’s luxurious , but i think i ’d rather wait for the sale			0
3/5 perfect for @entity265 - in - laws @entity55 : @entity266 and @entity267 , 100 per cent @entity269 cotton , 400 thread count , £ 40 the guest room often gets overlooked on the bed linen department			1
when vip guests go to stay in the @entity275 , the sheets are ironed six times before being put on the bed			0
this does n’t happen in our home , which is probably why we do n’t have many vip visitors			0
the matt finish of the @entity55 : @entity266 and @entity267 gives a classy look and feel , making it seem more expensive than it is however , this sheet could change all that			0
the percale weave gives it a matt finish , which immediately makes it look and feel very classy — more like an expensive linen than a mid-market cotton			0
the ivory colouring is very flattering against the skin ; past 50 everything helps			0
and it gives the illusion you have thought about the picky relatives , even if you ca n’t wait for them to leave			0
4/5 student - proof @entity299 : double fitted sheet , 100 per cent @entity269 cotton , 200 thread count , £ 12 the majority of us will spend a third of our lives asleep — if you discount some students who notch up another three years in a virtual coma			1
they leave home with a bag full of freshly laundered towels and sheets and return a couple of months later with a putrid , foul - smelling laundry bag no detergent can bring to heel			0
so why waste money on them ? this sheet is comfortable , the cotton is n’t too thin and it promises longer lasting durability			0
it also requires minimal ironing and suggests that it can be washed at lower temperatures unless it is dirty			0
which of course , it will be			0
3/5 @entity330 @entity329 @entity125 : luxury double fitted sheet , 100 per cent cotton , 200 thread count , £ 9.50 i have to confess that i had never been to @entity125 before taking this test			1
what have i been doing with my life ? no wonder i have no money			0
where they failed miserably on their mixed cotton and polyester sheet , @entity125 have won the crown with this luxury ( for them ) offering			0
it ’s a plain , white , soft , matt finish , generously cut , fitted sheet that could hold its own in the smartest houses			0
yes , it ’s a mere 200 thread , but who ’s counting ? it ’s £ 9.50 and it feels like ten times that price			1
even my husband , @entity356 , noticed the difference and this is a man who prides himself on once failing to spot that i had a leg in plaster			1

@entity36 puts thread count to the test in today 's *challenge*
literally referring to the number of threads woven together in one square inch of fabric , ' thread count ' has become a *popular* buzz word
but does it really make any difference to your nights sleep ?
