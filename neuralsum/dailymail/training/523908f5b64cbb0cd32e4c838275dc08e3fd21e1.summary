former @entity6 transport commissioner @entity9 , pictured , recommends @entity2 cities implement more bike paths and bike share programs her role as transport commissioner saw her overhaul how @entity6 's footpaths were used and breathe life back into the city by eliminating traffic and creating an environment that encouraged more people to walk			1
despite the success , at the time extensive cycle path networks were rolled out and the bike share system was introduced , they were viewed as controversial , according to the @entity37			2
' our streets are where we play and meet , kind of like the living rooms of @entity6 , and so when you change something like that it can cause a stir , ' she said			0
@entity46 has approved plans to close @entity48 to traffic so light rail can be implemented and a large plaza in front of @entity46 's @entity53 be created			1
when ms @entity9 proposed closing @entity5 there was massive concern , with businesses and theatre - owners anxious and worried as well as general scepticism from the public			1
despite her controversial plans , ms @entity9 has helped transform @entity6 's @entity5 but she continued with her plans , supported by mayor @entity62 , and went on to transform @entity5 in the middle of his re-election campaign			1

transformation : in approved plans , @entity46 will be closed to traffic and a plaza created in front of @entity53 , pictured , in the heart of the city but ms @entity9 said it was not all smooth sailing and that implementing the massive changes saw her become a target of the press and said reading the tabloid papers was not ' fun '			1

she said it was common to not see funding and policy guidance at national ( federal ) level			0
ms @entity9 is now an adviser to a national transportation association that develops cooperative approaches to key transportation issues			0
