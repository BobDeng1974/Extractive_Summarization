it was a strange feeling at the end of the game			2
the late tries conceded by @entity4 took the slight gloss off what was a great night for @entity8 rugby			1
i had to remind myself that @entity4 had just beaten a major team scoring five tries and 41 points			1
if you had offered me that before the game , i would have snapped your hand off but what the ending did was keep everyone ’s feet firmly on the ground			2
it was a near perfect performance for the first 50 minutes			0
not in execution , because there were some mistakes made , but in the way the team set out to play the game			2
despite winning the game , @entity4 's victory was stained by conceding late tries against @entity31 @entity32 had given the players the licence to play and that is exactly what they did			1
there was a vibrancy about the attack and defence that was so evident and every component of their game functioned very well			2
there was a lot of confidence in the team before the game , mainly due to the number of @entity51 players on show and the great start to the season they have had			2
but it was very obvious that this confidence was spreading to others as @entity58 and @entity59 had their best games for @entity4 for a long while			1
in the past year , the @entity8 lineout had struggled and part of that was down to @entity65 ’s throwing in with this issue affecting the rest of his game			0
on saturday , his throwing in was flawless and his ability to make ground with ball - in - hand were key to the momentum of @entity4 ’s performance			1
it was @entity59 , though , who brought the spark to the team as he added pace and tempo to the game as well as making good decisions			0
his breaks that created the tries for @entity87 and @entity88 were first class and highlighted the sharpness of thought and foot as well as great skill in making the scoring pass			0
@entity4 's @entity95 dives in celebration as he scores their fifth try at the @entity99 @entity100 is embraced by team - mates @entity88 ( left ) and @entity102 ( right ) after scoring his try the new boys in the team did well			1
@entity108 looks more an international player every time i see him , @entity107 controlled the game with a composure that belied his years and inexperience , @entity106 did well in the tackle area and @entity116 put in a huge effort as usual			0
@entity119 , on his debut , had a difficult start but settled quickly and will be wiser as a result			0
he should have had a try on his first cap as @entity124 chose to dummy rather than pass to @entity119 who was in under the posts			0
both players moved on as if nothing had happened which is exactly the right reaction to make			0
it was some night for the @entity124 brothers with both scoring but , more importantly , playing so well			0
they complement each other with @entity124 doing a lot of the hard graft and @entity134 more comfortable in the wider channels			0
it is incredible to think that , before @entity139 ’s injury , one of these two was not playing			0
that highlights the strength that @entity4 has in the second row			1
what really impressed me was how ruthless @entity4 were in taking their chances			1
apart from when @entity124 should have passed to @entity119 , every time @entity4 got in to the @entity31 22 , they scored			1
six chances and five tries is very clinical indeed and so different to what we are used to see from @entity4			1
how many times have we had gone through the phases and never looked like scoring ? this team has real cutting edge and a desire to win quick ball and make line breaks			0
it is also a team that prides itself on its defence so the late concession of three tries will give them something to work on this week in training			1
it was a hugely positive performance and result on saturday and one that continues the feel - good factor in @entity8 rugby			1
it continued the momentum @entity174 had started and sets us all up for the ultimate test on saturday , to play the mighty @entity177			2
i can not wait .			0
