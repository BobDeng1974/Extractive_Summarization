a police force is building up a huge stockpile of @entity2 which cost £ 150,000 in the last nine months alone - despite using the controversial weapon just once in eight years			0
campaigners have condemned the spend by the @entity7 police , which has had to cut millions of pounds from its budget and sack 800 officers - a quarter of the workforce - since 2010			0
figures seen by @entity13 reveal the force , which guards military bases around @entity16 , spent £ 361,185 on 363 tasers since the weapons were introduced in 2007			1
charge : @entity20 police have spend £ 360,000 on @entity2 , including £ 150,000 since april alone - despite using the controversial 50,000 - volt stun guns just once in the last eight years ( photo posed by model ) weapon : the force has almost 400 of these @entity2 , which it says are a safer alternative to guns some 217 of those , almost two thirds of the entire stock , were bought since april 2013 after police inspectors said they should become commonplace			1
yet they have been drawn from their holsters no more than 13 times			0
a taser was discharged on a suspect just once , during an incident in 2011 which was not within the force 's normal remit			2
seven @entity2 were aimed using a ‘ red dot ’ laser sight , and the remaining five were drawn but not aimed			0
not a single @entity34 was drawn from its holster in 2013			0
those figures could now fall even further after home secretary @entity43 called for the use of @entity2 to be reviewed amid claims they are used too much on vulnerable people			1
a report found 30 per cent of people tasered in @entity49 in 2011 had mental health issues - and half were from ethnic minorities			0
mrs may told a summit in october : ' imagine what it is like for the thousands of people with mental health problems , learning disabilities or other vulnerabilities who regularly encounter the police ... people who are confused , distressed and disorientated			0
crackdown : home secretary @entity43 called for the use of @entity64 to be reviewed amid claims they are used too much on vulnerable people			1
she told a summit in october the experience must be ' terrifying ' killed : @entity68 , 32 , burned to death after a @entity34 was fired despite him dousing himself in petrol ' and then imagine if that encounter also leads to physical restraint , or even being tasered by the police			0
' imagine being transported to hospital not in an ambulance , but in the back of a police car			0
or being detained in a police cell rather than a health - based place of safety or mental health ward			0
' that encounter must be terrifying			0
' the x26 - series weapons currently cost £ 1,050 each and are made by the @entity86 firm @entity85 in a 100,000 sq ft complex in @entity88 , @entity89			2
on patrol : armed @entity20 police on guard in @entity93 , central @entity49 ( file photo ) they are already common in @entity86 police forces and the firm , whose motto is ‘ @entity99 ’ , claims they have ‘ transformed law enforcement and become a vital tool ’			2
but despite bringing down injury rates in @entity86 states where they are used instead of guns , the weapons have been at the centre of several scandals			2
a @entity16 father died of severe burns after police tasered him - despite the fact he had doused himself in petrol			0
@entity68 , 32 , was set on fire by the 50,000 - volt charge outside his @entity116 home where he had threatened to take his own life			1
the @entity118 immediately launched an investigation into the 2013 incident and has since handed a file to prosecutors			0
the @entity20 police force has around 2,600 officers , the vast majority of whom are armed , guarding more than 50 strategic sites across the @entity16 including army , navy and @entity131 bases			2
officers also guard the @entity20 offices in @entity93 , the 35 - acre @entity135 headquarters in @entity136 , south @entity137 , the @entity139 facility in @entity140 and nuclear submarine bases on the @entity142			1
responding to today 's figures , released under the @entity145 , the @entity20 insisted tasers were needed as a non-lethal alternative to guns			1
but the costs were slammed by campaigners and @entity151 's shadow defence secretary @entity150			1
mr @entity150 told @entity13 : ' it seems strange that despite @entity64 being used just a handful of times since 2007 , the @entity20 has ordered 217 in the last 18 months			1
' why does the @entity155 need increased @entity156 , given how little it is used and the fact that officers already armed ? facility : among the sites guarded by the @entity20 's force is the @entity135 headquarters in @entity136 ( pictured ) stun : the @entity2 ' manufacturers insist they have saved lives where they are used instead of bullets ' over 90 per cent of the @entity167 carry firearms as part of their duties , enabling officers to protect themselves as well as the assets and personnel they are guarding			1
' is this just another example of chaotic defence procurement that has seen millions of pounds wasted under this government ? @entity16 taxpayers will want to know the answer			2
' campaigning lawyer @entity181 , who brought a landmark @entity183 case in 2013 accusing the @entity186 ’s @entity34 roll - out of being unlawful , said : ‘ there is a concern about why they have bought so many , where obviously there ’s not a need for them			1
‘ the @entity20 police are facing financial issues and the money obviously could have been spent in other areas - training , equipment or safety			1
‘ given the home secretary ’s speech in october , the likelihood is there ’s going to be a decrease in the coming years because she ’s very concerned about them			1
‘ it ’s going to be a lot of wasted money if the home secretary comes back after the review and says “ we only need one @entity34 for x number of officers ”			1
’ opposition : campaigning layer @entity181 ( left ) said there was ' obviously not a need for them '			0
shadow defence secretary @entity150 ( right ) suggested it could be more ' chaotic defence procurement ' @entity222 @entity16 arms control director @entity221 added : ' tasers are potentially lethal weapons and we ’ve always said they should only be used when there ’s a clear threat to life or of serious injury , and only as a last resort by high - trained law - enforcement officers			1
' what ’s baffling here is why the @entity20 police are spending vast amounts of money on a weapon for which there seems to be so little need			2
' we ’re already worried by the way our police authorities seem to think that more and more weaponry is the solution to every policing problem			0
' we only want to see the police and the @entity20 purchasing tasers if there ’s a clearly demonstrated security and policing need			1
' the @entity20 said the increase in @entity34 numbers was recommended by @entity252			2
' @entity253 did a routine police firearms inspection in 2013 and recommended that all front - line officers ( forward facing or public facing eg on the steps of @entity258 ) be trained to use @entity64 , as a “ less lethal ” option to the use of firearms , ' a spokesman said			0
' it is mandatory in the police world for firearms officers to have a range of other options to deploy , to reduce the potential for recourse to conventional weapons			0
' currently there are fewer than 400 @entity273 , and the stock is shared			0
' obviously a number are used in standard police training , and some will be damaged and need to be replaced on a continuous basis			0
' the one time an @entity34 was deployed , the incident was outside the @entity20 force 's normal remit ( file photo ) the spokesman added a @entity34 was discharged once by the force in 2011 , during a domestic incident in which a man with a knife was threatening two women			1
the incident was not within the normal remit of @entity20 police , but officers were tasked because they were nearby and ' successfully defused a life - threatening situation '			2
' @entity293 in the use of taser in accordance with national armed policing policy			0
' the @entity20 ’s @entity298 , which is independently chaired , and whose role is to oversee the proper functioning of the @entity155 , supports the recommendation from @entity252 inspectorate of @entity155 ( @entity252 ) in 2013 , that @entity155 increase taser training to all public - facing officers , and is tracking progress on its implementation			1

two thirds of @entity20 's 363 tasers have been bought since april 2013
yet just one of the 50,000 - volt weapons has ever been discharged
the @entity20 insists they are needed as a non-lethal alternative to guns
but shadow defence secretary told @entity13 figures appeared ' chaotic '
and home secretary has ordered review amid heavy use on mentally ill
