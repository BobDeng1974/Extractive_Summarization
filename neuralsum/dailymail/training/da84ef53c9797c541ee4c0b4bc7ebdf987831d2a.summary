by @entity0 @entity3 boss @entity2 's job as a @entity5 pundit gives him plenty of opportunity to check out his top transfer targets			1
working for @entity12 television as a commentator , the @entity10 boss is also in the enviable position of being able to scout for reinforcements for the next @entity17 season			1
here are five players he could be keeping an eye on during the tournament			0
scouting mission : @entity2 is able to keep an eye on his top club targets outstanding : @entity26 goalkeeper @entity25 top stopper : @entity25 currently plays for @entity12 side @entity28 @entity29 @entity26 goalkeeper plays for @entity28 in @entity31 and would represent a relative bargain compared to other targets @entity34 of @entity35 , @entity36 of @entity37 and @entity38 at @entity39 but lack of @entity17 experience may count against him			1
chance of signing : 2/5 wing wizard : @entity45 in action in @entity31 's opening @entity5 fixture @entity49 star : @entity45 battles for the ball in @entity53 match @entity45 excellent winger was recommended by @entity55 and well liked at @entity39 but more ominously @entity56			0
@entity3 are talking to @entity49 about @entity57 and right - back @entity58 but may not be able to compete with @entity56 's finances			2
chance of signing : 2/5 top of @entity2 's shopping list : @entity64 and @entity65 forward @entity63 , left @entity66 striker : @entity63 has scored plenty of goals for @entity65 @entity63 @entity70 striker is leaving @entity65 and they will sell , @entity3 have made a lot of enquiries about him but again there is competition from @entity76 , @entity77 and clubs in @entity79 and @entity80			1
@entity63 is keen on @entity3 but would want to play ahead of @entity81			2
chance of signing : 3/5 top striker : @entity84 has been a target of @entity2 's for a while and has been in great form for @entity31 so far in action for @entity56 : @entity12 forward @entity84 @entity84 @entity56 were ready to sell @entity84 before the @entity90 final but @entity91 wants him to stay			1
the @entity31 striker wants a pay rise and that could lead to a stand - off with @entity56 hierarchy keen on @entity96			0
@entity3 see too many complications			2
chance of signing : 1/5 @entity100 to join @entity3 : @entity101 , left , has already spoken of his desire to join the @entity10 on the move ? : @entity101 fancies a move away from @entity12 side @entity105 @entity101 @entity107 right - back was excellent against @entity108 , setting up two goals			1
however , defensive frailties may prevent @entity3 from paying the asking price of Â£ 7m			0
other clubs are keen and @entity3 are looking at alternatives such as @entity108 's @entity114 and @entity58			0
chance of signing : 3/5			0
