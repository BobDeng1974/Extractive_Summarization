amid a monsoon at @entity6 , this was a demoralising wash - out for @entity8 ’s national team			1
following a summer tour of near - misses in @entity2 , this was a step back			1
the result was entirely justified			0
while a late penalty - try ensured respectability on the scoreboard , this @entity14 series opener became a grim mis - match after half - time			1
@entity0 simply ceased to exist as an attacking force , until the horse had bolted			2
the world champions took an iron grip on proceedings and displayed all their experience and nous			0
@entity28 ’s men played the conditions far more shrewdly as @entity0 floundered deep in their own half			1
there was all the usual white - shirted courage and endeavour , but when it came to clever decision - making and composure under pressure , they were exposed and out - classed			0

they will have to quickly lick their wounds and prepare for a daunting clash with the mighty @entity113 next saturday			0
the management will be desperate to avert the dreaded prospect of another defeat , meaning the wait to generate precious winning momentum goes on			0
in the build - up to this match , much had been made of the fact that the @entity2 had been together for months and would thus come to @entity6 armed with momentum and cohesion			1
yet , it was @entity0 – in action for the first time in five months – who exploded into life at the start of this @entity131			1
within four minutes , the hosts were ahead and their opening score was a wondrous try			0
the ball came to @entity54 in midfield and the @entity139 centre ’s superbly - judged pass released @entity140 at full throttle			1
he surged past @entity79 and then backed his pace to burst along the left wing , outside a diving @entity77 , to race over in the corner			0
it was a blistering strike which raised the roof			0
although @entity57 missed the wide conversion , @entity0 were up and running – in every sense – and they so nearly extended their lead just three minutes later			1
a box - kick by @entity58 into the @entity2 22 bounced up awkwardly and may won the leap to claim the ball , but he was just unable to off - load to @entity57 who was alongside in support , with the line clear in front of him			2
@entity8 ’s team kept coming , storming forwards in waves of bold intent			0
they should have had a second try in the 10th minute when @entity55 ’s audacious , flat , cut - out pass picked out @entity52 on the overlap on the right , but the full back fumbled			0
it was a costly error , as the @entity2 were soon on terms			0
@entity78 brilliantly re-gathered @entity82 ’s high kick near halfway and the visitors pounded deep into enemy territory			2
@entity81 broke through @entity58 ’s tackle then the ball was shipped across to the right and the imposing @entity86 smashed his way past @entity63 in the 22			0

@entity82 missed the conversion and the scores were level			1
the initial drama gave way to a relative lull , as @entity0 used their rolling maul to telling effect and two @entity57 penalties re-established their advantage before @entity82 struck back at the other end to make it 11 - 8			1
the kicking duel continued as @entity57 missed a drop - goal shot six minutes before the break , but after @entity82 briefly levelled the contest at 11 - 11 , @entity0 ’s @entity215 struck his third penalty to send his side in 14 - 11 up at the break			1
yet , home rule was short - lived after half - time			2
a 43rd - minute @entity226 penalty attempt hit the post , but the @entity228 were cranking up the tempo and intensity , and they took the lead six minutes into the second half			2
they were building steadily on the left when @entity0 ’s debutant lock , @entity72 – on for @entity63 – raced out of the defensive line but failed to make his tackle and the space he left behind was clinically exploited			2
@entity89 rumbled forward and quick ball to the left allowed @entity85 to score from @entity77 ’s pass , even though he had to take the ball behind him before scoring			2
@entity82 could n’t add the extras from an awkward angle , but the world champions were firmly in the ascendancy and @entity0 were reeling			1
