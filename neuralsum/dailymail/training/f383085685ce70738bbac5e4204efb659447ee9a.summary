' mince flies ' contain mealworm beetle larvae and locusts as well as traditional ingredients dinner guests may raise their eyebrows – and run a mile – if you serve them mince pies made from locusts and beetle larvae this holiday season			1
but ' mince flies ' are a more sustainable , protein - rich and healthy alternative to conventional recipes , according to their makers			1
the delicacies will be handed out at @entity16 ’s famous foodie market in @entity17 to raise awareness of sustainable food			2
they are designed to inspire people to consider the environmental impact of the food they eat , especially at @entity24 time			1
at a time of the year that sees most of us overindulge , the @entity27 @entity26 @entity25 challenged food scientist and tv personality @entity32 to rethink traditional @entity24 treats and create a more sustainable seasonal snack			1
the result is ‘ mince flies , ’ which are made from mealworm beetle larvae and locusts , mixed with traditional dried fruit and spices to make them more palatable			1
‘ one of the simplest ways of tackling the sustainability of our food supply is by exploring alternative sources of protein , ’ mr @entity32 said			2
‘ if we want to be able to feed a growing population , even at @entity24 people need to be open to new food adventures and look beyond traditional favourites such as turkey , goose or gammon			1
scroll down for recipe the ‘ mince flies ’ ( pictured ) are designed to inspire people to consider the environmental impact of the food we eat , especially at @entity24 time ‘ with nearly 2,000 known edible insect species to try , supplementing our diet with insects is one solution to combat rising food prices and the environmental impacts of traditional livestock farming			1
' trust me , these “ @entity77 ” really are delicious and we hope they will get people thinking about what their traditional @entity24 dinner might look like in the future ’			1
with the global population set to pass nine billion in 2050 , scientists predict that the world ’s agricultural output needs to increase by 70 per cent to feed everyone			0
traditional meat production causes multiple sustainability issues , including large greenhouse gas emissions , while insects on the other hand , are very efficient consumers of resources			2
the crunchy locust on top of the bronzed pastry made for unconventional presentation , but the filling was spicy and moist - if a little slimy the crunchy locust on top of the bronzed pastry made for unconventional presentation			2
i bit into the locust with trepidation			0
it gave way with a crunch and its wings had a papery , but not unpleasant texture			0
i could n't quite bring myself to eat its heads because of its staring eyes			2
inside , the filling was moist and tasted just like a traditional , spicy mince pie - with added crunch and a nutty aftertaste courtesy of the worms			1
despite my fears , it tasted good			0
the crispy mealworms on top of the pastry tasted neutral but also nutty with a crispy texture , while those inside were plump and a touch slimy much like the the sultanas , which were chewy			2
despite liking the taste , seeing the slimy worms inside the pie diminished my culinary enjoyment			0
without the decoration on top of the festive treat , the pie could fool the most informed of foodies into thinking it was a normal rich and flavoursome mince pie - which was surprisingly filling thanks to its high protein content			1
i 'd eat another one - without looking inside			2
‘ one of the simplest ways of tackling the sustainability of our food supply is by exploring alternative sources of protein , ’ food scientist and tv personality @entity32 said			2
locusts and mealworms ( shown on the pies ) contain as much protein as beef , with around half the calories one third of the global population , or two billion people , already eat insects as a regular part of their diet			1
@entity157 , for example already has 20,000 small scale insect farms rearing over 7,500 tonnes of grasshoppers , crickets and other edible insects a year			0
insects are nutritious because they are high in essential fatty acids , calcium , zinc , iron and @entity166			1
@entity167 for gram crickets have comparable levels of protein compared to beef half the calories and about 60 per cent less fat			1
children from the @entity175 and @entity176 in @entity177 , south east @entity16 , have tried the ‘ mince flies ’ and are dishing them out to @entity179 at @entity180			1
@entity182 , a year seven pupil from the @entity176 , said : ‘ at first i was nervous about trying something new , but the mince flies tasted fantastic			1
’ @entity186 , chief executive of @entity187 said : ' @entity188 @entity26 @entity25 is passionate about showing young people the exciting and rewarding opportunities there are for them in careers in the sciences and engineering			0
we hope that our “ @entity77 ” will excite children to consider new ways of thinking to develop solutions to the way we live our lives in the future			0
’ @entity32 will be performing his ‘ @entity204 ’ show at @entity205 at the @entity206 , @entity207 from 11 - 14 march 2015			0
the crispy mealworms on top of the pastry tasted neutral but nutty with a crispy texture , while those inside were plump and a touch slimy much like the the sultanas , which were chewy decoration for the pies include buffalo worms and a dried locust ( pictured ) pastry : 125g plain flour , a pinch of salt , 55g butter cut into cubes and 2 - 3tbsp of cold water filling : nine tbsp of mincemeat , eight tbsp of dried buffalo worms and one egg decoration : extra buffalo worms and a dried locust for each pie method : 1			1
put the flour , salt and butter in a food mixer or processor ( you can easily do it with your hands , too ) , then mix or pulse ( or rub together if hand - making ) to the consistency of breadcrumbs			2
add the cold water a splash at a time on a slow speed until the dough comes together , then wrap in cling - film and chill in the fridge for 15 mins before use			0
mix the mincemeat with the worms			0
cut out circles of pastry large enough to sit in the hollows of a metal cake tray , then fill each with a heaped tablespoon of mincemeat , leaving 1cm of clear pastry around each edge 4			0
paint around this rim with the egg mixture , then add a pastry lid made from a slightly smaller pastry cutter and press around the edges to stick them together			0
for decoration , make a slit in the top of each pie , then press a dried locust into it			0
paint around it with more of the egg mixture and sprinkle the remaining worms on top			0
bake in the middle of a hot oven at @entity283 ( fan ) / @entity284 ( conventional oven ) / gas mark 6 for about 20 minutes then cool on a wire rack			0
when they are cool to the touch sieve some icing sugar from a bit of a height , and they are ready to serve .			0
