our love affair with hipster foods such as prosecco , pulled pork and pancetta is coming to an end as more and more of us get fed up of hearing about them			2
ultimate menu brags such as sea bass , kale , slow roast meat and couscous are also getting short shrift , although @entity17 's favourite quinoa is still going strong			1
the growing backlash comes as a result of friends boasting and posting pictures of their latest foray into fashionable food online			1
cute cupcakes and the seemingly ubiquitous pulled pork took joint first place with 32 per cent saying they were tired of the foods			1
five per cent said they were fed up with healthy kale while 17 per cent claimed they had had enough of smoothies			1
@entity37 cuisine , which includes couscous and dishes such as lamb tagine , also made it on the list , with five per cent saying they are tired of it			1
our fascination with @entity33 is also losing its sparkle with 12 per cent saying the fizz is more naff than posh			1
four per cent are fed up with pancetta and claim it 's just a fancy @entity73 name for chopped bacon while three per cent say those who serve slow roasts have nothing to do all day but cook			1
the @entity79 survey , which was conducted on behalf of @entity80 , asked consumers which foods they think have become ' too popular ' on social media and in general			2
' food trends come and go so it 's inevitable that people will get tired of things and want to move on , ' said @entity88 , managing director of @entity80			0
cupcakes ( 32 per cent ) and kale ( five per cent ) also made it into the top ten must not have foods list four per cent say that the word pancetta is simply a fancy way of describing bacon ' when @entity98 was invented in the 1960s , fondues were all the rage along with prawn cocktail and funnily enough they 're now making a bit of a comeback			1
' by contrast , cupcakes are full of calories and they 're artificial in flavour			2
so it 's a case of being naughty but not nice			0
' i think we 'll see a return of proper old fashioned cakes like @entity114 cake , @entity116 tarts and malt loaf			0
the sort of cakes that your grandma would make and keep in a tin			0
' foods like clothes go in and out of fashion			0
cup cakes and pulled pork turned up everywhere last year			0
' but this year we 're likely to see a move away from anything too fancy or artificial which is why cup cakes have become less popular and people are rediscovering grandmas ' cakes recipes which are simple and wholesome			0
' he added : ' the results of the research will be of interest to companies with an eye on new product development and consumers who want to avoid serving up the dishes that are considered boring			0
' @entity37 cuisine , such as lamb tagine and cous cous ( pictured ) is no longer as popular as it was			2

@entity33 , sea bass and @entity145 losing popularity
backlash due to online boasting and posting pictures on the internet
32 per cent are bored of cupcakes and two per cent no longer like haggis
