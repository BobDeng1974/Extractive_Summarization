it was a fourth win in the last five runnings of the @entity18 for trainer @entity19 but , surprisingly , his first grade one of a so far frustrating season			1
the @entity23 trainer will be hoping the floodgates now open , especially with stable star @entity25 due to return after more than a year off at @entity26 a week on saturday			2
@entity27 won the @entity2 at @entity5 by 14 lengths on saturday @entity19 said : ‘ we will give @entity0 january off , get him ready in february and hopefully be there in march			1
even for me i must admit i did think that was impressive			0
’ the surprising thing is that @entity0 ran six times in @entity35 without winning			2
since crossing the @entity36 , he has bloomed with previous victories in the @entity38 at @entity39 and the @entity40 ’ @entity2 at @entity26			0
@entity18 runner - up @entity41 ’s cracked it could now head down the handicap route after being put in his place			0
