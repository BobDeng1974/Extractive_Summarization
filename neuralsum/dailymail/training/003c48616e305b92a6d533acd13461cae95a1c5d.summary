@entity2 captain @entity1 's @entity0 could be over before it begins after the veteran goalkeeper suffered a twisted ankle in training			1
the 36 - year - old @entity7 keeper is out of @entity2 's opening game at the @entity9 against @entity10 and is a doubt for the @entity2 's second match against @entity13			1
with @entity15 's @entity14 set to deputise , @entity1 is in a race to be fit to for @entity2 's final @entity18 game against @entity19 on june 24			1
but @entity20 has also been struggling with a bruised rib – but the 27 - year - old promised @entity23 on the morning of the @entity10 game that he was fit to play			2
he twisted the ankle , which is his main problem , but also jarred his left leg and aggravated a thigh problem @entity1 hobbled off and later tweeted : ' there are many ways to be important , even if you ca n't be a protagonist on the pitch			2
' the third goalkeeper in the squad is uncapped 21 - year - old , @entity49 , of @entity50 , who was criticised for his performance by the @entity53 media when he conceded three in a practice match against @entity55 last week			0
the goalkeeping crisis adds to @entity23 's defensive woes			0
the @entity2 boss lost his first - choice left - back @entity59 , when the @entity62 full - back suffered a calf strain in training on thursday			1
it has not forced him home but he will not be fit for the @entity18 game in @entity67 , which means a reshuffle at the back			0
it was unclear whether the @entity71 would settle for switching @entity73 ’s @entity72 to the left and bring in @entity75 of @entity62 at right - back , or whether he would move @entity77 from centre - half to left - back and start with @entity80 ’s @entity79 in the middle			1
defensive power has always been @entity2 ’s great strength but @entity23 ’s team have struggled at the back , which has already prompted the manager to push @entity87 forward from his preferred deep midfield role to accommodate @entity89 as a screener , protecting the centre - halves			0
he will be most reluctant to move @entity77 , who has been his rock			0
follow : @entity93 ( left ) walks next to @entity2 's coach @entity23 during the training session in @entity67 instructions : @entity23 talks to his players during their last training session before the @entity10 match @entity1 is the country ’s most - capped footballer of all time , has been first - choice in goal for nearly 15 years and won the @entity0 in 2006			1
@entity2 ’s poor display four years ago in @entity103 was largely attributed to his absence , when he was forced off with a sciatic nerve problem during the opening game			2
striker : @entity108 ( left ) could be in line for a starting spot against @entity10 ' @entity87 and @entity1 are our most important players , ' said @entity77			2
' they ’ve got character and they make the whole team play , so we need to take good care of them			0
' @entity23 did not blame @entity1 ’s twist on the pitch in @entity67 which is not perfect			0
@entity14 is a more than worthy replacement for @entity1 , considering he is @entity15 's no 1 keeper			1
the 27 - year - old has eight caps for the national team and started for @entity2 in their friendly against @entity126 at @entity127 last month			0
@entity14 recently had some injury problems of his own after bruising his ribs during training in @entity131 on june 2 but has recovered in time to face @entity10 in @entity67			1
@entity14 signed for @entity15 from @entity132 in july 2011 for a transfer fee of 3.5 million euros .			0
