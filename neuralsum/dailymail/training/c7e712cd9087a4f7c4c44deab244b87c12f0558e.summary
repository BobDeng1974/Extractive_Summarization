trainer @entity1 's assertion that @entity2 is in top form for his comeback in tuesday 's @entity5 at @entity6 gained substance when galloping companion @entity8 dead - heated in the @entity10 at @entity11			1
after @entity8 had rallied to share the spoils with @entity15 's @entity14 , @entity12 revealed his gelding had been slammed 10 lengths by @entity2 in a racecourse gallop at @entity6			2
@entity2 was third in last season 's @entity5 but has a 9lb pull for the six lengths he was beaten by @entity23 's re-opposing 2013 winner @entity22			1
@entity2 , on parade at @entity25 , was last season 's @entity26 winner however , @entity2 , last season 's @entity26 winner , has not run since finishing second to @entity30 in the @entity31 at @entity11 on @entity32			1
since then he has suffered a hairline fracture of the pelvis , which cost him his place in the @entity36 , and undergone an operation to aid a breathing issue which @entity12 felt cost him dear in the @entity31			0
in addition , with @entity1 's jockey son @entity39 is now retired , @entity2 will be ridden by @entity41 , the first time another jockey has ridden him in a race			1
@entity1 is backing @entity2 to do great things in tuesday 's @entity5 at @entity6 @entity1 said : ' @entity8 has been working with @entity2			1
trying to keep up with him is probably why he is fit			0
' it is the first time we have given @entity2 a racecourse gallop before the start of his season but everyone is doing it now			2
' he goes there fitter than last year and is as good as we have ever had him			0
' we will see if the breathing operation makes a difference			0
something stopped him in the @entity31 and that is what we thought it was			0
' @entity8 heads for the @entity57 in which he was third last year .			0
