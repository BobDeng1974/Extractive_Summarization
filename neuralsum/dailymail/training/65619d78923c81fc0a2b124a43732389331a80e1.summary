@entity0 has been written off way too quickly , even by some @entity2 fans			1
@entity2 ’s results , performances , character , signings and selections can all be questioned and the manager deserves some criticism			1
but is now the right time to be judging @entity0 as a failure ? in my view that would be harsh			1
the critics have put last season ’s massive improvement down to @entity18			0
there have been plenty of teams who have had a special player who did n’t achieve what @entity2 did last season ( look at @entity26 with @entity27 as a recent example )			1
it was so much more than that , and @entity0 deserves his share of the credit for taking a team from a bang average seventh - place finish in 2012 - 13 , to within a whisker of the title last season			1
he ’s got a lot wrong this season , but in my view , january is going to be a massive month for the @entity2 boss			2
with @entity18 going , he needed to bring the right strikers in during the summer , and that did n’t happen			0
@entity2 manager @entity0 is under pressure at @entity2 after a disappointing start to their season that business up front was mystifying			1
@entity47 was only ever going to be a squad player			0
@entity49 and @entity50 both looked destined for @entity2 but for reasons not made totally clear neither deal happened			2
and everyone thought @entity54 was leaving , only for the player himself to change his mind at the last moment			0
the @entity59 move looked a little desperate , and so it has proved			0
so through mishap and bad fortune @entity2 have been left with one top - level striker			1
if @entity0 can address the problem in the window , i think he has a good opportunity to turn @entity2 ’s season around			1
assuming everyone sticks together , including the captain			0
the focus has been on @entity71 recently – what ’s his best position ? should he be dropped ? what about a new contract ? @entity2 's @entity76 strikes late with a header to give his side a vital 1 - 0 victory over @entity80 at @entity81 @entity0 has been under fire after @entity2 remain in the bottom half of the @entity84 well hang on a second			1
it ’s not all about one player , and considering it was @entity71 ’s unfortunate slip that cost @entity2 last season – and cost @entity0 a place in history - i think the captain ( in my opinion the greatest player in @entity2 ’s rich history ) should not even be mentioning a new deal , as he did in an interview with @entity99 in october , when he needs to get his own game sorted out – his club needs him doing it out there , not talking about contracts			1
the deal has been offered , so once it ’s signed that should be the end of that issue			0
in my view , a manager who stood by @entity71 when so many were hammering him after that slip , deserves support from his captain			0
times were tough for @entity71 back in april and @entity0 gave him total backing			2
times are now tough for @entity0 , so the captain needs to return the favour to his boss			2
@entity2 captain @entity71 applauds the fans as they chant his name after the @entity80 clash like @entity122 across the way , @entity2 has always shown a remarkable ability to stick together and support each other			1
if someone strays away from that , they are criticised			0
right now , scrutiny of @entity0 ’ ability is understandable			2
but a captain seemingly focused on a new deal instead of his football is n’t helping the manager			0
with that crucial @entity136 game around the corner , @entity71 needs his big game mentality – he ’s done it before on massive @entity140 occasions , and @entity2 will need him to do it again			2
it ’s the least @entity0 deserves from his skipper			0
win that and suddenly the pressure will ease a little bit			0
and if @entity0 is allowed to follow it up with some shrewd wheeling and dealing in january , he can re-establish his reputation once again			0
@entity59 ( centre ) has not yet scored a @entity84 goal for @entity2 since joining for £ 16million			1

@entity2 are in the bottom half of the @entity84 table after 13 games
@entity0 has come under *increased* pressure after a poor start
a late @entity76 header meant @entity2 beat @entity80 1 - 0 on *saturday*
@entity2 face @entity160 on *tuesday* night looking for *consecutive* wins
