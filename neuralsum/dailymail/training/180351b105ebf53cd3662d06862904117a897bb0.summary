by @entity1 correspondent seasoned traveller : this tiny red - necked phalarope clocked up a remarkable 16,000 miles in a round - trip from @entity5 to @entity6 he may not be much to look at but this little fellow is a record breaker			1
despite weighing less than a bag of crisps , the red - necked phalarope clocked up a remarkable 16,000 miles in a round - trip from @entity5 to @entity6			1
the incredible journey is the longest recorded for a @entity15 breeding bird - and one of the world ’s great migrations			1
@entity19 of the @entity20 said : ‘ to think this bird , which is smaller than a starling , can undertake such an arduous journey and return safely to @entity5 is truly extraordinary			0
’ the red - necked phalarope is one of @entity27 ’s rarest birds , with as few as 15 nesting sites in the @entity5 and the @entity29			1
it has been thought that after breeding in @entity32 , they set off eastwards to winter in the @entity34 sea			0
but a tiny tracking device weighing less than a paperclip and worn like a backpack revealed they go somewhere else entirely			0
mr @entity19 said : ‘ when this guy left @entity5 , he headed west straight across the @entity41 , via @entity42 and @entity43			0
‘ he went down the eastern seaboard of @entity45 into the @entity46 , crossed into the @entity47 where he wintered in the warm waters of @entity49 and @entity6 before returning back by more or less the same route			2
‘ that ’s one of the world ’s great migrations			0
’ mr @entity19 told @entity54 that he almost fell out of his chair when a tag on discovering the details and added : ‘ we are freezing up here in @entity5 and it ’ s quite nice to think of our red - necked phalaropes bobbing about in the warm tropical waters of the @entity47			2
‘ it means that what we thought was a medium - distance migrant is a long - distance migrant			0
incredible journey : the bird flew west from @entity5 , across the @entity41 and down the eastern seaboard of @entity45 , before crossing the @entity47 to reach @entity6 data : a tiny tracking device attached to the phalarope revealed how far the bird had travelled lightweight : the tracking device worn like a backpack on the bird is no bigger than a paperclip ‘ it is one of the world ’s great migrations			1
’ one of @entity27 ’s rarest birds , the red - necked phalarope is a wader that arrives in @entity32 in mid to late may and mates and raises its young before setting off again in july or august			1
in a reversal of gender roles , the more brightly coloured female often leaves the male sitting on the eggs while she touts for new mates			0
despite their marathon migration the red - necked phalarope does not hold the world record			1
the @entity96 term travels a colossal 43,000 miles in a round trip between the two poles makes it the ultimate long - distance traveller			0
rare : the red - necked phalarope is a wader that arrives in @entity32 in mid to late may and mates and raises its young before setting off again in july or august			2
