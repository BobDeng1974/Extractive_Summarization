@entity8 , 36 , and his wife @entity10 , 32 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , who admitted the manslaughter of their son @entity15 , received three years and two years , three months ' imprisonment respectively			1
the couple admitted the charge at earlier hearings			2
mr @entity21 , at the @entity22 , said : ‘ the secular courts of this country apply the secular law of the land			2
they do so equally to all who come before them			0
the law respects the right of everyone to freedom of thought and belief			0
‘ however the right to manifest one 's religion is not absolute			0
it is limited in particular by the rights of others			0
the state has a particularly important duty to protect the right to life , especially when a young child is concerned			0
’ the death of a baby boy from rickets arose from the religious beliefs of parents @entity8 ( right ) and his wife , @entity10 ( left ) , a court heard today			1
the couple have admitted the manslaughter of their son , @entity15 the judge said @entity15 was born on january 1 2012 and died in june 14 that year			1
he was found to have been suffering from rickets resulting from severe @entity56 deficiency			1
the court heard the child was born at @entity59 , @entity60			2
from birth , he had medical problems , and the judge said it was emphasised on behalf of the couple that the vitamin d deficiency was not diagnosed at that stage , nor was @entity69 given advice about taking supplements			2
the mother did not attend a scheduled check up on march 8 and @entity15 was not seen by a health care professional from then on to the day he died			1
mr @entity21 , at the @entity22 , said : ' the state has a particularly important duty to protect the right to life , especially when a young child is concerned ' from april it was appreciated by the couple that their son was unwell , although his health fluctuated over the next two months			2
‘ it is clear that , because of their own religious beliefs , the defendants did not in fact seek medical assistance			0
’ @entity90 told mr @entity21 at the couple ’s sentencing hearing at the @entity22 that , although their beliefs arose out of the @entity95 , that church does not approve of medical care being withheld			0
the couple admitted the charge at earlier hearings			2
mr @entity108 , prosecuting , said the case arose out of religious belief , the overarching belief held principally by @entity8 that there was a @entity102 in @entity103 who would guide the family when it came to any matter that affected life			1
he said : ‘ there is no suggestion of any ill treatment in the conventional way of neglect or cruelty , it is a neglect to seek proper medical care and then to call medical care at the end			0
’ the child was born on january 1 2012 and died on june 14 that year , and was suffering from rickets , resulting from a severe @entity56 deficiency , the court heard			1
‘ there was , throughout the better part of pregnancy and into early life , a rejection of either medical advice or advice from relatives to seek medical advice , ’ mr @entity108 said			0
@entity8 was baptised into the @entity95 in 2000 and in 2009 was recommended to be a delegate to its @entity134			1
mr @entity108 told mr @entity21 at the couple 's sentencing hearing that , although their beliefs arose out of the @entity95 , that church does not approve of medical care being withheld ‘ he was highly regarded in the church , ’ counsel said			0
a senior figure in the church had said that the couple ’s views , as reported to him by police investigating the case , were perhaps the most extreme that he had ever encountered			0
mr @entity108 said : ‘ the reality is that had rickets been diagnosed earlier , and appropriate treatment given , there could have been a complete recovery , and therefore the death was avoidable			2
’ @entity8 remains of the view that death was @entity102 ’s will , counsel said			1
@entity159 , defending @entity8 , said : ‘ this court will rarely have before it such a gentle , humble and hitherto law - abiding peaceful couple			1
’ he said his client could be a responsible , adoring and essentially wonderful father			0
the attraction of a suspended custodial sentence , with a lengthy supervision requirement , was obvious			0
‘ the loss of their son haunts them , and will do , for the rest of their lives			2
they do n’t expect that pain to pass			0
’ he added : ‘ the covenant he ( @entity8 ) had sworn with @entity102 blinded his objectivity and common sense			1
’ @entity8 , who was working as a nurse at @entity183 , did not reject medical treatment outright			1
‘ he simply believes that a large amount of modern medicine is procedural and formulaic			0
he believes medicines are given to patients without much thought as to whether they are appropriate to a particular case			0
’ mr @entity108 told the @entity22 that , although their beliefs arose out of the @entity95 , that church does not approve of medical care being withheld mr @entity194 said the baby was discharged from the hospital at @entity59 without his mother being given the essential @entity56 that she desperately needed			1
she is a vegan , and more starved of @entity56 than most , mr @entity194 said			1
had the @entity56 deficiency been diagnosed , the parents would have been alert to the need to be vigilant			1
but the @entity56 levels were not tested until after the child ’s death			1
@entity205 , defending @entity69 , said : ‘ nobody could fail to be moved by this tragedy			0
or the suffering of that baby ’s mother			2
‘ she has confronted the reality that she failed the child , by virtue of her view that it would be a breach of a covenant made between her , her husband and their @entity102 , and an abandonment of her sincerely - held religious views			0
’ @entity221 is caused by a lack of @entity56 and calcium and can cause deformities @entity221 is a disease , which affects bone development in children			1
the condition causes bones to become soft and weak , leading to deformities			0
in adults the disease is referred to as osteomalacia or soft bones			0
the most common cause of rickets is a lack of @entity56 and calcium			1
@entity56 is essential for children to form strong bones and comes from exposure to sunlight			1
it is also found in oily foods , including fish and eggs			2
in rare cases , some children are born with a genetic form of the disease			2
@entity221 is referred to as a victorian - era disease , due to its prominence at the turn of the century			0
it has largely disappeared in the western world , thanks to the rise in @entity56 enriched foods , including margarine and cereals			1
but in recent years , experts have warned of an increasing number of cases in the @entity264			0
while still relatively small numbers - 900 cases were diagnosed in 2012 - studies have revealed a high number of people in the @entity264 have low levels of @entity56 in their blood			1
any child with a lack of @entity56 in their diet can develop the disease			1
but the condition is more prevalent in children with dark skin , due to the fact more sunlight is needed to deliver enough @entity56 those born premature and children taking medication that can interfere with @entity56 are also at a higher risk of developing the disease			1
a child 's hands and face only have to be exposed to sunlight for around 15 minutes several times a week in spring and summer to provide enough of the vital @entity289			0
that combined with a healthy diet incorporating @entity56 and calcium - rich foods help strengthen the bones			2
children with rickets are more likely to fracture their bones			2
the condition can cause pain , poor growth and deformities , including bowed legs , curvature of the spine and a thickening of the ankles , wrists and knees			0
the disease is easily treated through encouraging a child to eat the correct foods and take vitamin supplements .			0
