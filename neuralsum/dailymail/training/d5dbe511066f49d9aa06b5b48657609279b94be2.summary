it was his deathbed interview , and a yellow - faced @entity2 , @entity4 's most notorious underworld figure , had some bombshells to drop			1
a little over a fortnight before he died of liver cancer in october 2013 , @entity2 sat down for an interview with 60 minutes and revealed he had been responsible for four cold - blooded killings			1
claimed he did n't feel anything when he killed people			1
and the man who once said ' you put a camera in front of me ... i 'll lie my head off ' insisted he was telling the truth			2
' that 's what it 's all about , the last interview , the last picture show , ' he said			1
' i 'm telling the truth now			0
' deathbed confessional ' : dying of liver cancer , @entity2 appeared sick and yellow - faced in his final interview with 60 minutes last year			1
in the interview he confessed to four murders			0
he wanted to be like @entity37 : chopper 's body was riddled with tattoos at the end			0
resemblance : @entity43 played @entity39 in the self - named film , released in the year 2000			2
myth # 1 : he blowtorched people 's feet and snipped toes off with boltcutters @entity51 writes : ' he had never chopped anyone 's toes off with a set of boltcutters , nor had he ever applied a blowtorch to anyone 's feet			1
' that had all been borrowed from the legend of @entity61			0
' myth # 2 : he killed @entity64 , a missing @entity65 bikie boss @entity51 writes : ' ( friends ) @entity66 and @entity68 dismissed the confessions as a grab for a final payday			1
' he had been nowhere near @entity73 when @entity74 had disappeared , they said			0
' myth # 3 : he killed notorious paedophile @entity77 @entity51 writes : ' it is highly likely that @entity2 and @entity79 had nothing to do with @entity82 ' death , yet in the years to come , @entity2 would ' confess ' hundreds of times that he and @entity84 had murdered @entity82			1
' he would run a dozen different versions in books , shows and interviews , all of them factually impossible , of how they had slain the monster of @entity92 '			0
myth # 4 : he killed @entity94 , a union heavyweight @entity51 writes : ' there was no hard evidence linking @entity2 to those killings ... nothing more than his say - so , or he would have been arrested long ago			1
' source : the @entity101 : @entity102 his confessions came as little shock to the many @entity4 who thought of ' @entity106 ' as a badass - a murderous , but strangely familiar , character			0
but , like many of @entity39 's stories , there was little evidence			1
for three of the four murders , the only proof was his word			0
the interview was one last effort at cementing the myth of @entity39			1
and it was a missed opportunity to tell the truth about it all , author and journalist @entity51 argues in a new book , @entity122 : the @entity123			1
' he did n't have the courage to tell people that finally , a lot of what he was saying for the last umpteen years was rubbish , ' mr @entity51 told @entity128			1
chopper , who spent 23 years and nine months in prison , ' was n't nearly as bad as he said he was ' , mr @entity51 said			1
' he was a most unremarkable crook			0
' his tall tales of murder , all based on his say - so , were likely too incredible to be real			0
mr @entity51 wrote that @entity39 's associates , @entity66 and @entity135 , ' dismissed the confessions as a grab for a final payday '			1
they said @entity39 was ' nowhere near ' @entity73 , @entity141 , at the time he was said to have killed @entity65 bikie boss @entity64 in 2002			1
mr @entity51 also told @entity128 that chopper he was only a teenager in 1971 , when he was supposed to have murdered union heavyweight @entity94 - an unlikely proposition			1
and as for his apparent murder of notorious paedophile @entity145 in jail , in the mid- 70s ? ' his story does n't match ( the facts ) at all , ' mr @entity51 told @entity128			1
there 's only proof he was behind the deaths one of his alleged victims : drug dealer @entity155 ' @entity154 , who was gunned down outside @entity157 in @entity158 , @entity159 , in 1987			2
chopper was acquitted of his murder after pleading self - defence			0
likewise , mr @entity51 wrote that @entity39 's stories of chopping of toes , torture and blowtorching people 's feet were n't grounded in reality			1
the tagline of @entity43 's movie was ' never let the truth get in the way of a good yarn '			2
an autographed picture of ' @entity176			0
shot dead : even @entity2 was surprised when he was acquitted of murdering @entity177 ( pictured ) on the grounds of self defence			1
victims ? in his final interview , @entity2 claimed he murdered union heavy @entity94 ( left ) and @entity64 ( right ) , a @entity65 bikie boss			1
in his prime : chopper worked as an informer for @entity187 's @entity186 in 1986 - 87			0
if anything , chopper appears to have been a lousy crook			0
whether it was armed robbery , impersonating a police officer or killing @entity194 , ' just about everything he ever did , he was caught for , ' mr @entity51 said			2
and while he often said his motto was never @entity197 , @entity39 , who would spend 23 years and nine months behind bars , almost always did			2
' he would open up like a watermelon falling off a truck , ' mr @entity51 wrote			1
but he had a glorious imagination , which grew out of his love of cowboy tales and gangster yarns as a child			0
he had something of a lonely childhood - his mother , a devout @entity209 , was a ' religious zealot '			0
he developed an ambition to become a household name similar to those other legends of @entity4 criminal history , @entity37 and 1920s @entity159 gangster @entity215			0
and that 's what he became			0
he first felt the glow of infamy when , imprisoned in the notorious maximum security @entity222 wing of @entity223 in the 1970s , he convinced a fellow inmate to cut his ears off in order to get him shifted out			1
everyone slashed their wrists , mr @entity51 wrote			1
chopper , however , needed to do something more dramatic			0
and while the extent of his biggest crimes are questionable , many of his bizarre antics were the stuff of truth			0
he audaciously tried to kidnap a @entity239 judge in 1978			0
and he once spooned two or three tablespoons of faeces into the prisoners ' stew at @entity223			0
as you can imagine , it made him a lot of enemies			0
@entity2 was a devoted dad to his two sons , @entity84 ( pictured ) and @entity248			2
father figure : @entity2 promised wife @entity250 he would never return to crime			2
the myth around @entity39 ballooned in the 1990s after the publication of some of @entity39 's ' diaries '			1
and then it appeared to spin out of control			0
@entity4 have purchased more than 500,000 copies of his books , according to an @entity262 report			0
plus there was @entity43 's feature film , which hit the big screen in 2000			0
mr @entity51 , who followed @entity39 's case for years , trawled through his prison file and interrogated his friends and enemies , told @entity128 that in reality , @entity39 was just a fraction of the myth he created			1
' i would say there 's about ten per cent truth , ' he said			1
he said @entity277 - devoted father of his two boys , @entity248 and @entity84 - became imprisoned by the myth of @entity39			2
' everyone wants to be famous ... he craved fame , he craved acceptance , ' mr @entity51 said			2
' @entity2 , was not prepared to step outside the cartoon character and say , " here i am ! " ' ( even in his books ) he gives you big , juicy hints some of this was n't all quite right			1
but we all sort of chose to ignore thos ' ' he told people he never cut people 's toes off with a pair of boltcutters			2
really he was just giving people what they wanted			0
earlier this month , @entity2 posthumously won the ' @entity296 ' gong at the @entity297 for a role he played in the comedy @entity300 '			2
it was a strangely appropriate tribute , mr @entity51 said			2
' i think he 's been acting his whole life , ' he told @entity128 , ' so it 's not surprising '			0
the @entity101 : the man behind the legend , inside and out by @entity51 is available now for $ 32.99 through @entity307 .			2

new book busts myths about @entity2
@entity2 got a fellow inmate to chop his ears off to get out of maximum security
claimed he had murdered four people in his deathbed confessional
there is only proof he killed one person , @entity177
friends wrote off his confessions as a ' grab ' for money
author @entity51 says @entity39 's final interview was ' *sad* '
' did n't have the courage to tell people what he was saying was rubbish '
' i would say there 's about ten per cent truth '
