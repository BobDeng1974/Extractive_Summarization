as @entity4 @entity3 captain @entity2 beavers away on his potential @entity3 pairings , it is the combination of bad luck and bad judgement that is threatening to undermine his prospects			1
this week the @entity10 season draws to a close with the @entity13 finale in @entity14 and the feelgood factor should be overpowering since two young @entity4 thrusters presently sit one and two in the race for the £ 6.2million bonus			0
both have just completed outstanding victories , showing exactly the sort of composure under pressure that would make them ideal for @entity25			1
trouble is , neither of them will be there			0
the expressive @entity43 , precisely the sort of passionate character who thrives at a @entity3 , summed it up well after his fine victory at the @entity52 on sunday			1
‘ @entity2 wo n’t be kicking himself for not picking me but he will probably be wanting to kick me for not playing like this a little earlier , ’ said the 27 - year - old			1
the turn of events has left @entity4 ’s last winning @entity3 captain feeling distinctly uneasy			1
‘ i would have picked @entity38 over @entity40 , certainly , ’ said @entity37 , skipper in 2008			1
‘ @entity38 has won twice this year , he ’s hot and i like hot players			1
why not pick a rookie ? it ’s ok picking experience if you ’re @entity63 but so often with us it ’s losing experience			2
’ wildcard : 2012 @entity69 champion @entity40 has been selected for his debut @entity3 appearance late charge : @entity43 missed out despite his excellent recent form , including winning the @entity74 just to complete the picture , @entity75 will turn up at @entity25 and find the first questions will be about his pr gaffe of walking out of the @entity52 at the halfway stage			1
his playing partner @entity30 also dropped out			2
he was given the all - clear regarding a rules decision by the @entity10 ’s chief referee and still decided it was n’t enough to settle his state of mind			2
his bizarre withdrawal cost him his place among the top 30 this week			2
actually , there will only be 29 in attendance			0
the man who finished 30th was @entity90 , and his absence is just one more sorry aspect of a team in a palpable state of disarray , with the @entity3 now only a fortnight away			2
controversy : @entity75 ruffled some feathers with his withdrawal in @entity99 out of contention : @entity30 also dropped out of the @entity52 the first major occasion to take place in @entity103 after the independence referendum will be the @entity3			1
and , now there is the distinct possibility of a ‘ yes ’ vote , it is intriguing to wonder what impact , if any , it would have on the event or the atmosphere			0
@entity103 ’s first minister @entity113 , a keen golfer and high - profile supporter of the @entity3 , will be prominent anyway , but imagine if he is empowered with the mandate he seeks ? one thing that must be running through the mind of @entity63 ’s @entity3 captain @entity118 — if @entity103 is awash with patriotic fervour , it might be a smart move to send @entity122 out in the opening series of matches			1
referendum : scot @entity126 would be a popular choice for the opening series of matches if the yes vote wins out in the @entity103 independence referendum @entity131 picks @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 no surprise to see rabid sports fan @entity133 take in the home opener for the @entity135 at @entity136 on sunday night			1
after his recent experience at @entity139 , it must have been nice for him to see the home team win for a change			0
what was noticeable watching the match on television , though , was how often the cameras cut to @entity133 , who was given tickets by the @entity135 ’ star quarterback , @entity147			0
he was shown signing autographs before the match and then profiled at least three times thereafter			0
if ever proof was needed he is now a worldwide , a-list sporting superstar , this was surely it			0
superstar : @entity133 was swamped by autograph hunters at @entity135 ' season opener quote of the week ' what a week			0
i got to drive some sweet cars at the @entity52 and not i 'm off to @entity14			2
it just means the world to me			0
' @entity4 @entity163 started the @entity13 play - offs in 124th place out of the 125 qualifiers			0
now , after shooting 62 and 63 at the weekend , he is one of 29 who will contest the finale in @entity14 and is exempt from the masters , the @entity69 and the @entity69 next year			0

decision to overlook exciting *youngsters* @entity38 and @entity43 has been questioned
@entity2 chose @entity30 , @entity175 ad @entity40 as his three captain 's picks
2008 captain @entity37 said : ' i would have picked @entity38 over @entity40 '
debate over @entity75 's withdrawal from the @entity52
@entity3 comes to *iconic* @entity25 from *september* 26 to *28*
@entity63 are defending champions after winning at @entity186 in 2012
