cheers : @entity6 , pictured leaving outside @entity19 today with comedian @entity20 and the @entity21 for everyone if campaign , used a speech to announce £ 250million to buy shops and pubs by 2020 money from dormant bank accounts has helped to swell the coffers of @entity30 which is bankrolling the idea for a decade , with funding from the @entity33			1
in a speech on social investment funds , mr @entity6 said £ 250million would be available until 2020 to ‘ help communities with ambitions to own local assets like pubs , shops , community centres and affordable housing ’			1
the money – paid out in grants or loans – will help people in towns , villages and cities to buy and run facilities which are no longer financially viable as a business			1
some of the money from the lottery fund will go into grants to support projects which can not be expected to turn a profit			2
but £ 50 million of the money will go into a community asset fund to provide grants and loans to help get projects off the ground which could go on to be commercially viable over the long term			2
mr @entity6 said : ‘ everyone knows how vital institutions in our towns and villages are , like village halls , playing fields , local pubs			0
‘ and everyone knows how - despite the best efforts of parish and local councils - these can face closure			2
’ dream : pub locals would be able to run their local if it closes down while residents could buy playing fields to stop them being developed he insisted that using public money to help people to take over and run pubs and shops was not ‘ some pipe dream ’			1

he highlighted @entity99 swimming pool in @entity100 , which was closed by @entity101 in 2003			0
it was saved by a community group but it came under financial pressure			0
investment from @entity30 meant they were able to install solar panels to heat the pool , reduce their running costs and make it financially viable as a community centre			0
mr @entity6 said he hoped that the new funding will mean that ‘ projects like this will be possible not in just in one community – but in every community across the country ’			0
splash : mr @entity6 praised @entity99 swimming pool in @entity100 , which was saved by local people after being shut by the local council speaking to a @entity121 staged in @entity122 as part of the @entity125 's chairmanship of the @entity126 , mr @entity6 also announced a consultation on new tax breaks for social enterprises			0
and he welcomed the launch , supported by the @entity131 , of the world 's first social stock exchange , which will showcase social impact businesses and provide a means for potential investors to measure their success			0
the prime minister launched a staunch defence of the @entity16 , which formed the centrepiece of his leadership in opposition but appeared to have been quietly shelved after the financial crash			1
@entity145 strategists have said the focus must be on the economy , immigration and welfare			0
but mr @entity6 defied his critics – including many in the conservative party – to signal that the @entity16 will remain a key feature of his premiership			1
‘ some people occasionally ask me whether i still believe with the same passion in the vision of building a bigger and stronger society			2
i 'm absolutely prepared to fight for this			0
@entity121 investment can be a great force for social change , it can help us to build the bigger and stronger societies we want to see .			0
