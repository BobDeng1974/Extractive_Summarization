the ‘ vow ’ by @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 , in the left - wing @entity9 newspaper yesterday , amounts to @entity0 capitulating to demands made by the @entity3 left - wing establishment in recent years			0
yet , despite having huge constitutional and financial implications for everybody in the @entity14 , the three party leaders cooked them up behind closed doors without any proper debate – and with @entity18 at the fore			2
here , @entity21 editor @entity20 examines the ‘ bribes ’ which have been offered north of the border in a desperate attempt to sway tomorrow ’s referendum			0
the @entity41 formula , devised in the 1970s by then @entity42 chief secretary to the treasury @entity41 , was meant as a temporary measure to solve rows in the @entity46 government over how much money should be allocated to @entity3 , @entity48 and @entity49			1
but politicians have repeatedly ducked the challenge of reforming it – mostly for fear of provoking a row with the @entity3			0
the decision is yet another u-turn by @entity5 who said in 2008 the formula ‘ can not last forever ’			0
the idea of resources shared ‘ equitably ’ will raise a hollow laugh across the rest of the @entity14 , given the capitulation over @entity41			1
unlike those living in @entity39 , @entity3 are already able to enjoy free social care for the elderly and free student tuition			0
@entity48 claims the decision to preserve @entity41 will leave the country £ 300million a year poorer than if money was allocated fairly			1
deal : @entity70 and @entity5 in 2012 signing the agreement which led to tomorrow 's referendum a counter to claims by @entity70 that the @entity75 is under threat from @entity0			1
the running of the health service north of the border is already the responsibility of @entity81			2
but new powers – expected to allow @entity81 to vary the income tax rate by at least 15p in the pound – would allow extra money to be raised for healthcare			1
with @entity3 in charge of every aspect of its own @entity75 , there is little or no justification for allowing @entity3 mps to continue to vote on the running of the @entity75 in @entity39			1
a statement seemingly tossed out without consideration of the constitutional implications			0
the @entity81 is the result of legislation enacted by @entity0 , which could be repealed			2
no @entity81 can bind its successor – yet the leaders are promising to do exactly that			2
experts say the only way to make @entity81 permanent would be to introduce the @entity14 ’s first ever written constitution – a task that could take @entity81 years to achieve			1
@entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 have no agreement among their parties to give new powers to the @entity3 or change the constitution			2
the deal has been hatched behind closed doors , with @entity18 taking a lead role			0
mr @entity5 can expect a rebellion by @entity114 mps who want an @entity39 parliament in which @entity3 can not sway the vote on issues with no effect on their constituents			1
what is certain is that , in the event of a no vote , the last nine months of the current @entity81 will be dominated by the fallout			0
there is already resentment that the vow was made in a @entity3 newspaper , without any warning .			0

three main parties promised £ 1,300 more than average spent on every @entity132
it is part of @entity41 *funding* formula - called ' *grossly* *unfair* ' by own founder
@entity114 mps have *slammed* ' *panicked* ' offers granting @entity70 ' *victory* '
the @entity41 formula for the allocation of resources will continue
the @entity14 exists to ensure *opportunity* and security for all by sharing our resources equitably
the final say on how much is spent on the @entity75 will be a matter for the @entity81
the @entity81 is permanent
*extensive* new powers will be delivered to the @entity81 , starting on *september* 19
