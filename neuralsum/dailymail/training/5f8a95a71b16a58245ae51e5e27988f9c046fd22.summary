@entity0 has ordered a new fleet of aircraft and is promising more leg room for passengers despite squeezing in eight additional seats			1
the new @entity8 @entity7 aircraft has a capacity of 200 but the budget airline plans to fit the planes with 197 seats – eight more than its current fleet of @entity15			1
the aircraft have the same dimensions but controversial @entity0 boss @entity18 promised passengers will be more comfortable in the 737 @entity20 planes thanks to slimmer seats and smaller toilets and galleys in a redesigned fuselage that includes an additional emergency exit			2
the details were part of the no - frills airline ’s announcement that it has agreed to purchase up to 200 of the new ‘ game - changer ’ jets from @entity31			1
the deal will be worth as much as £ 22bn as @entity0 plans a massive expansion into existing and new markets with an eye on keeping costs low			2
mr @entity18 , chief executive of @entity64 ’s largest budget airline , said the 737 @entity20 aircraft contain new features that will trim its operating costs by around 20 per cent			2
he said the savings will be passed on to customers via lower fares			0
with more efficient and quieter engines , the @entity31 will reduce the airline ’s fuel consumption by up to 18 per cent and the eight additional seats will bring in extra cash			1
with an expanding fleet that can hold more people , @entity0 is expecting to grow from over 82million passengers in 2014 to over 150million by 2024 when all of the planes are in service			0
@entity0 predicted that the additional seats would be worth £ 62,000 per plane a year			1
having 197 seats instead of 200 will help the airline keep its costs down as one flight attendant is required for every 50 passengers			1
by avoiding a configuration of 200 seats , the airline will not have to hire additional cabin crew members			1
' @entity92 ' : @entity31 claims its 737 @entity7 will reduce the company 's normal fuel consumption by 18 per cent , along with reducing noise emissions by 40 per cent speaking at a press conference in @entity97 where he and @entity98 chief executive @entity37 signed the deal , mr @entity35 said the new aircraft would usher in a ' new era ' of price wars in @entity64			1

‘ this is the aircraft we have been waiting for in @entity0 for probably 10 years now			2
it is going to mark a step change in improving @entity0 's efficiency			0
' it means that we 're going to expand and grow very strongly in @entity64 , both in new markets and in going in and taking traffic away from incumbent carriers			0
' i hope it will hasten in an era of a new price war in @entity64 over the next 10 years , which like all the old price wars , @entity0 will win			1
' expansion : @entity35 said the deal would reduce @entity0 's operating costs by 20 per cent and would lead to cheaper air fares for passengers with its growing fleet , @entity0 plans take market share from legacy carriers such as @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133			1
it also hopes to add flights to the destinations it currently services and expand to new markets in @entity137 , @entity138 and the @entity139			0
@entity0 is the 737 @entity20 's first customer and has a firm deal for 100 jets and an option to purchase an additional 100			0
they will go into service starting in 2019			0
the 737 @entity20 aircraft features the company 's ' @entity147 ' , which features sculpted sidewalls , led lighting that ' enhances the sense of spaciousness ' and larger pivoting overhead stowage bins			2

taking on the new 737 @entity20 will help @entity0 to expand its fleet to 520 by 2024 , nearly doubling its annual passengers			0
mr @entity18 said that he expects the company to create 3,000 jobs for pilots , cabin crew and engineers across @entity64 as it expands			0
