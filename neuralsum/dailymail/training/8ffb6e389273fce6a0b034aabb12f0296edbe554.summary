by @entity1 reporter published : 20:58 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 20:58 est , 4 march 2013 it was always going to be included in his top 50			1
the exhilarating mixture of triumph over adversity , romance and melodrama captured the heart of veteran film critic @entity11			2
when compiling his list of best @entity14 films he had already chosen @entity15 - but erased it at the last - minute , opting for 49 films and leaving it up to the public to decide on the final entry			1
yesterday mr @entity11 was left feeling vindicated			2
the public 's choice : @entity23 readers voted for @entity15 in their best @entity14 film , which won eight @entity25 and seven @entity26 more than 3,000 people submitted their entries to the @entity23 with more than 500 @entity14 films suggested			1
and with @entity15 proving to a popular choice there could only be one winner for mr @entity11			1
@entity33 feel - good film : popular @entity14 director @entity35 holding up his @entity25 for best director for @entity15 repeatedly described as the ultimate feel good film , it went on to win eight @entity25 and seven @entity26			1
in the film , @entity39 plays @entity41 , an 18 - year - old orphan from the slums of @entity43 who appears on the @entity45 version of @entity46			2
he has wangled his way on to the show not to get rich quick but to get in touch with a girl he loves but has lost contact with			0
she has been sold into prostitution but is such a fan of the quiz he is hoping she will be watching			0
when the film opens @entity41 has already won the top prize and is being interrogated by police who believe he cheated			0
as h answers their questions it becomes apparent his poverty - stricken upbringing and petty criminal past have provided him with all the knowledge he needs to answer the questions			0
mr @entity11 said : ‘ actually when i was first asked to do this [ list ] @entity15 was on there and i excluded it partly out of curiosity to see what kind of reaction it might get			1
‘ @entity15 was the one i wanted to put in , apart from the fact that it won eight @entity25 which is remarkable for a @entity14 film , it ’s a multi-layered story – it ’s not simply about the questions – in explaining how the kid can answer all the questions it gives us a sense of @entity45 life : the poverty , the corruption , the dishonesty			1
it ’s a very believable portrait of @entity45 life			0
it got a lot of entries			0
curious : film critic @entity11 left @entity15 out of his top 50 @entity14 films , wondering if the public would choose it for their vote - and they did ‘ @entity15 does n’t have a phoney feel - good ending			1
there is a sense of hope which runs throughout the film which is great			0
‘ it ’s educational without being earnest			0
‘ last month saw mr @entity11 , 79 , unveil his list of 49 films in the @entity23 with the inclusion of 1981 @entity107 film @entity106 which he described it as the best teenage film ever made			1
mr @entity11 said the responses from @entity23 readers had left him in no doubt that films still have an important role in the lives of many			2
he said : ‘ movies are still very important to people and so they should be			0
the cinema is a great art form and we should never lose that			0
‘ it provides escapism which is a big factor and films can teach us a lot about ourselves , other people and other cultures and societies and that ’s what @entity15 does			2

@entity11 left one place in his top 50 @entity14 films to a public vote
he *suspected* they would choose @entity15 - and they did
@entity11 named @entity106 from 1981 as the ' best teenage film ever made '
