@entity0 , the designer of the assault rifle that has killed more people than any other firearm in the world , has died in hospital at the age of 94			1
the creator of the @entity8 more than 60 years ago died in hospital his home city of @entity11 , near the @entity12 - where his gun is still made			1
he had been ill for some time and had been in intensive care since november 17			0
there is one @entity8 for every 70 people in the world , the deadliest weapon ever created @entity26 hero : @entity0 in 1949 , two years after the weapon he invented went into mass production legacy of death : @entity0 celebrating the 50th anniversary of his weapon in 1997 ( left ) with a t - shirt listing some of the conflicts in which it was intrumental			1
right , at his home near the town where it is still made honoured : he met president @entity42 just three months ago			2
mr @entity42 expressed his ' deep condolences ' @entity0 , a @entity45 peasant with little formal education , designed the eponymous rifle in 1947 - with the letters @entity8 referring to ' @entity49 ' ( @entity8 ) and the year of its release			1
but the rifle and its variants soon became the weapons of choice for dozens of armies and guerrilla groups around the world			0
specifically engineered to work in the harsh conditions in which @entity26 troops operated , it became one of the most successful weapons ever produced and turned its inventor into one of the most lauded men in the @entity26			1
cheap , efficient and easily mass - produced , the gun soon became synonymous with killing on a sometimes indiscriminate scale			1
it was taken up by militants as far afield as @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 , to name a few			0
@entity77 was infamously pictured clutching the deadly weapon			0
militants : @entity77 was pictured with the weapon including in this photo in june 2001 conflict : a @entity84 rebel fighter as she heard @entity86 's forces had been driven out of @entity87 in 2011 in the @entity90 ( pictured ) @entity89 troops reportedly threw away their m - 16s and took @entity93 ak - 47s conflict : a @entity96 worker armed with an @entity8 during the war in @entity98 in july 1998 , in which thousands died soldiers in the aftermath of a massacre in which 19 people including eight children were killed in a hail of @entity106 in @entity107 , @entity108 , in 1998			1
@entity108 face constant danger from drug - related gangs widespread : young rebels in @entity73 hold an @entity8 during the conflict with the president @entity113 in 2003 @entity114 , son of the former president of @entity75 , in 1997 when martial law was declared in the nation lethal tipple : a man holding alcohol and shooting an @entity8 in the air in @entity123 in march 1997 , when 1,000 protesters gathered to respond to rumours the embattled then - president , @entity125 , had resigned invading @entity89 troops reportedly found a gold - plated @entity0 in one of the palaces of @entity129 , left			1

the weapon , named for its inventor and the year when it was created , was never patented in @entity152 so was widely copied the @entity8 's story truly began in 1942 , when @entity26 soldiers siezed new - style automatic rifles from @entity157 troops			1
unlike traditional or semi-automatic rifles , they could fire a whole magazine of bullets simply by holding down the trigger , because the recoil from each shot ejected the previous cartridge			0
entrenched in the conflict of the @entity167 , the @entity26 set to work straight away on copying the @entity169 ' designs			1
but their first versions were clunky , weighing more than 5kg without bullets , and the task of creating a new design fell to @entity0 , who had created an unsuccessful gun prototype earlier in the war			1
his design mashed together the best elements of previous weapons and won a competition in 1946 , going into full production the next year			2
accuracy was not its strongest point but it endured for its simplicity and reliability in even the harshest of conditions - built , as it was , in the wilds of @entity188			0
it was not patented - opening the door for millions of ' pirate ' versions - because of the culture which existed in the communist state			0
all ideas were property of the government , not one individual person , and pride came from helping the great @entity26 army			2
source : @entity201 there are an estimated 100 million kalashnikovs , one for every 70 people in the world			1
the gun is in official service in 55 countries and adorns the flag of @entity210			0
its vast popularity was partly down to the fact its design was never patented , so it was widely ripped off			0
this was accelerated by the @entity26 's policy of allowing friendly countries to imitate its designs of weaponry to strengthen its position during the @entity221			2
the @entity0 was prized for its sturdy reliability in difficult conditions			2
during the @entity227 war @entity89 soldiers reportedly threw away their m - 16s in the harsh jungle and took every @entity8 they could find			2
the 205 - year - old @entity231 factory , which makes the weapon and is seen by @entity45 as a national icon , always complained that its potential income was hit badly by the ' pirated ' versions of the designs made abroad			1
but @entity231 has also suffered from dwindling demand and a failure to make up for this with foreign orders - a problem plaguing many specialised @entity242 industries			0
@entity45 president @entity42 , who met mr @entity0 just three months ago , expressed his ' deep condolences ' over his death			1
born in a @entity188 village as the 17th child of his family on november 10 , 1919 , mr @entity0 had a tragic childhood during which his father was deported under @entity26 dictator @entity251 in 1930			1
in october 1941 he was heavily wounded and shell - shocked in a @entity26 defeat by the @entity157			2
he reportedly first conceived of the weapon while recovering in hospital			0
despite the lethal legacy of his weapon , @entity152 lavished mr @entity0 with honours including the prestigious @entity152 prize , the nation 's highest honour , for designing the iconic rifle			2
in 2007 , president @entity42 praised him , saying ' the kalashnikov rifle is a symbol of the creative genius of our people			0
' the inventor had said he had never intended for it to become the world 's most popular weapon , and he fell into making it by accident			1
instead he had wanted to design farm equipment ' such as a lawnmower ' , he claimed			1
yet he carried on working as the chief designer at @entity231 well into his 80s			0
he profited little from his gun , and almost not at all before the collapse of the @entity26 in 1991			1
because of the lack of patent laws he was , like the inventors of more harmless global successes like @entity283 , merely a state employee			0
' i created a weapon to defend the fatherland 's borders , ' he said during an award ceremony at the @entity289 to mark his 90th birthday			2
fame : despite the advent of hundreds of other guns , the @entity8 by @entity0 ( pictured with his designs ) led the pack for its hard - wearing simplicity and the ease with which it could be copied the former @entity188 peasant , pictured in 2002 , continued working as a leading gun designer well into his 80s celebration : the ageing inventor had a complex legacy but was honoured as a @entity45 hero indirectly , @entity0 leaves a bloody legacy			1
he claimed he would rather have invented a lawnmower ' it 's not my fault that it was sometimes used where it should n't have been			0
this is the fault of politicians			0
' on another occasion he said : ' after the collapse of the great and mighty @entity26 so much c * * p has been imposed on us , especially on the younger generation			2
i wrote six books to help them find their way in life			0
' there is a bronze bust of him in his native village of @entity328 in the @entity188 region of @entity330 - and it is a local tradition for newlyweds to lay flowers there			0
' they whisper " @entity336 , wish us happiness and healthy kids , " he once said			0
" what other gun designer can boast of that ? " ' dangerous : kalashnikovs in @entity72			0

former @entity45 peasant designed the @entity8 after the @entity167
popular with militants , the gun is still made in his home city of @entity11
its low price and wide production made it synonymous with mass killing
inventor *insisted* he created it to ' defend the fatherland ' of @entity26
he never wanted to design guns and would rather have built a lawnmower
there is one @entity0 for every 70 people in the world
