by @entity0 published : 06:58 est , 19 january 2013 updated : 09:01 est , 20 january 2013 two slaughtermen have been sacked after an undercover investigation exposed shocking cruelty to horses at an abattoir			1
the disturbing video shows them being beaten with metal poles and illegally stunned in groups of up to three at a time before being killed			1
in one horrifying moment a stunned horse appears to regain consciousness , only to find itself hanging upside down and about to have its throat cut			2
they also saw horses which appeared to be sick or injured and had n't been immediately put down			1
founder @entity35 , 63 , told @entity37 : ' we have rescued around 700 horses and we were concerned about where we were saving them from			1
' ' it 's unbelievably depressing there			2
they should n't be stunned or shot in front of each other like that			1
' it 's total disrespect for animal welfare			2
' the scandal emerged as several @entity53 supermarkets have been exposed as selling frozen beef burgers which contain horse meat			2
the alert was first raised by @entity58 food watchdogs after horse dna was found in burgers sold through @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 in @entity58			2
it subsequently emerged that burgers from the same batches were sold in the @entity53 outlets of both @entity61 and @entity62			2
incredibly , the beef content in one @entity72 burger sold by @entity61 was actually 29 per cent horse meat			0
the horses at the @entity27 are believed to be butchered for @entity76 food markets			1
three horses are crammed into a pen alongside each other before being stunned under animal welfare laws horses are not supposed to be stunned or slaughtered in front of each other because it causes severe distress a slaughterman is shown beating the horses with a metal pole as they are shunted through the abattoir animal welfare group @entity31 carried out the investigation at the @entity27 over eight weeks under the @entity92 1995 , horses can not be slaughtered in sight of another horse as it causes severe distress to the animal			1
the footage , which has been uploaded to @entity97 , shows three horses crammed into a tiny pen before being stunned			1
the @entity24 told the @entity99 it has revoked the licences of two slaughtermen after a probe into the video			1
@entity24 head of approvals @entity104 said : ' as soon as we got the footage and reviewed it we took immediate action to revoke the slaughtermen 's licences			1
' we will also look to gather further evidence to see if we can prosecute			0
' the @entity27 told @entity110 it views animal welfare and public health with paramount importance			1
in a statement it said : ' in attendance at the @entity116 are three full time @entity117 comprising of an official veterinarian and full - time meat hygiene inspectors throughout production			0
' it said the incidents were ' not the norm , but of an isolated nature ' and they have taken disciplinary action against the individual featured			0
the statement continued : ' i agree horses should individually enter the stunning area and most certainly not three at a time			1
' however , small horses and ponies having spent years together as companions are difficult to separate			1
horse lovers would understand that			0
' my opinion and that of other veterinarians is it is better to keep those types together to reduce the stress , providing swift dispatch is achieved			0
' an @entity146 spokesperson said the organisation is viewing the footage and will decide whether to prosecute			0
in a statement it said : ' the footage is shocking and upsetting to watch			0
with the @entity152 ( @entity154 or @entity155 ) regulations 1995 in mind , we have concerns that horses appear to be in the stunning pen at the same time rather than individually as the law requires			1
' we also have concerns about some of the animals that appear to be injured			0
we have requested a copy of the unedited footage with a view to investigating			0
' the @entity146 said it is viewing the footage and will then decide whether it has a case to prosecute there were also some concerns that horses were ill or injured at the abattoir and had n't been immediately put down an @entity146 spokesperson described the footage as ' shocking and upsetting ' former government chief veterinary officer @entity173 , who viewed the footage , has told @entity110 he was shocked by the ' appalling ' breaches of animal welfare			1
' we see three animals stunned at the same time and it is totally illegal and contrary to welfare slaughter regulations , ' he said			0
' it 's a significant welfare problem for a number of reasons			0
it 's harder to render them unconscious in a group and they have a higher chance of regaining consciousness before you 've completed the procedure			0
' @entity192 , chief executive of @entity193 , said : ' the breaches , from what we 've seen , are throughout ; from the care of the animals to the slaughter process			0
' horses are intelligent animals			2
when they see an animal stunned in front of them you can only imagine the distress that animal is going through			0
there are , without doubt , welfare issues here and it is plain illegal			0
