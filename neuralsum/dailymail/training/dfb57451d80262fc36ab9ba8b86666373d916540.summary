good things come in small packages — except bubbles , apparently			1
over the past year we ’ve developed a thirst for champagne and sparkling wine in big bottles , with sales of magnums more than doubling in @entity10			1
@entity11 recently launched a range of magnums and @entity14 is now selling a £ 499 @entity15 — the equivalent of eight bottles of champagne			1
but what difference does a big bottle make ? well , for a start , they have show - stopping qualities			1
walk ( or rather , stagger ) into a room carrying one and it says generous host without you even having to open your mouth			2
@entity15 , holding 150cl or two bottles , effectively slow down the ageing process of the fizz within			1
that ’s because contact with air helps wine to develop and age			1
a magnum neck size is the same as a 75cl bottle so they both have the same amount of air in contact with the wine inside , but there ’s twice as much liquid inside the magnum			1
it ’s this lower air - to - wine ratio that enables the wine inside to evolve more gently over time			1
so it is that fizz from a magnum usually tastes fresher and brighter than the equivalent wine from a standard sized bottle			1
a magnum neck size is the same as a 75cl bottle but there ’s twice as much liquid inside the magnum unfortunately , buying a bigger bottle does n’t necessarily mean bagging a bargain			0
magnums are usually at least double the price of a single bottle , owing to higher production and packaging costs			1
but there are some great wines to be found , assuming you do n’t mind lugging the bottle home afterwards			0
of course , there is one other major logistical problem with big bottles : they do n’t fit in the fridge door			1
but a kitchen sink or ice bucket filled with half water , half ice will chill a magnum nicely in half an hour			0
when it comes to pouring , the easiest way to do it is with one hand at the bottom of the bottle , thumb in the punt , or dimple			0
then with the other hand , cradle the neck of the bottle			0
magnums require a little more muscle than usual ; @entity103 ( containing four bottles of champagne ) take both stamina and a steady hand			1
@entity109 the occasion with a @entity15 and you ’ll need an extra pair of hands — as the equivalent of eight bottles it weighs more than 11kg ! if you fancy super-sizing your fizz this year , here ’s my pick of the magnum bunch			1
@entity121 150cl , £ 11.99 , @entity122 @entity122 has shipped in a few different magnums this year but this one stands out not just because what ’s inside is delicious , but the dark , curvy bottle makes it look way more expensive than it is			1
really frothy and fabulous , with lots of apple and citrus fruit flavours			0
@entity131 150cl , £ 12 on offer ( normally £ 15 ) , @entity133 pretty label ? tick			2
lovely stuff inside the bottle ? double tick			0
great value ? double tick , again			0
this one ’s fresher than many of its rivals too , with gorgeous pear fruit flavours			0
do as the @entity144 do and serve it with a dash of @entity147 if you want to mix it up a bit			0
@entity152 ’s @entity151 , taste the difference 150cl , £ 14.50 on offer ( normally £ 19 ) , @entity152 ’s this is one of the best own label proseccos around , with a bit more weight to it than most			2
but crucially , it ’s still light on its feet with crisp lemony fruit			0
made from 90 per cent pinot noir and meunier and 10 per cent chardonnay , it ’s ripe with lemon peel and rich with toasty flavours and because prosecco is generally lower in alcohol than wine ( this one ’s 10.5 per cent ) you can enjoy a glass or two without having to have a lie down afterwards ! the @entity178 ’s @entity177 150cl , £ 17.50 , the @entity178 @entity179 is made in the same way as champagne , with the second bubble - inducing fermentation taking place in the bottle ( with prosecco , this happens in a tank )			1
but being @entity189 and made from different grapes , it tastes completely different			0
@entity191 the flavours are bigger but not as fine as champagne			0
this one ’s on flying form though , made exclusively for @entity196 by a small family estate in @entity198			2
voted @entity199 at the recent @entity200			0
@entity163 150cl , £ 39.99 some champagnes are as lean as a supermodel but this one ’s got proper body and curves			2
made from 90 per cent pinot noir and meunier and 10 per cent chardonnay , it ’s ripe with lemon peel and rich with toasty flavours			0
@entity213 150cl , £ 75.95 , @entity214 & @entity215 hardly cheap , but a real cracker			2
the style is super smart , with pure red fruits and textured toasty flavours			0
a bit big for a stocking perhaps , but it ’ll definitely fit in a pillowcase			2
@entity191 £ 79.99 , @entity11 ( online only ) @entity224 , a lifelong fan of this particular champagne house , once declared @entity226 the ‘ most delightful address in the world ’			1
not a quiet wine , this ’ll get the party started with its out - there citrus flavours			2
@entity232 £ 100 , @entity14 created by blending over 300 so - called ‘ base ’ wines and made pink by the addition of a touch of grand cru pinot noir			1
@entity240 , bold and powerful , with red fruits and spice , this ’ll cope with more than just a plate of smoked salmon			0
it ’ll take on turkey quite happily .			0
