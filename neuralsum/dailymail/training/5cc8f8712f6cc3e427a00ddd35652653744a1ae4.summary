@entity0 was eradicated in 1979 and was one of the world 's most - feared diseases			2
it covers the body in a painful rash ( pictured ) it was one of the world ’s most feared diseases that covered a person ’s body in painful pus - filled spots			1
and scientists fear that smallpox , which was eradicated in 1979 , could re-emerge from the most unlikely of places – defrosting corpses			1
a handful of experts fear that bodies infected with the disease , which are defrosting in @entity21 - having become exposed from melting frost – could potentially begin a cycle of infection , should a person make contact with the remains			1
concerns have been raised for years , but a newly - discovered ' giant ' 30,000 - year - old virus found in @entity21 permafrost has led @entity33 's @entity32 ( @entity32 ) to warn that the prospect of a smallpox comeback can not be ruled out			1
a report by @entity37 questioned whether frozen bodies of people who had smallpox – and might have died from the disease – could release the virus into the environment			1
if such a scenario did occur , it could potentially start a global pandemic			1
the question has been the source of speculation for over a decade as scientists believe the disease could be in suspended animation in bodies that are surfacing as a result of the warming climate , @entity47 reported			1
in 2002 , author @entity57 wrote an article for @entity59 asking whether smallpox is lurking in the @entity61			0
he described a ‘ nightmarish place near the @entity63 ’ in north eastern @entity21 where authorities in @entity65 gathered a team of people to investigate remains of bodies from the 18th century with smallpox scars as they were worried that flooding could resurrect the virus			1
author @entity57 wrote an article for @entity59 asking whether smallpox is lurking in the @entity61			0
he described a ' nightmarish place near the @entity63 ' ( pictured ) in north eastern @entity21 where defrosting bodies infected with smallpox oozed smallpox is an ancient disease caused by the variola virus and results in a nasty rash where lesions are filled with fluid and then pus			1
the highly contagious disease was fatal in up to 30 per cent of cases before it was eradicated in 1979			1
it no longer occurs naturally but was contagious - spreading with contact between people and saliva droplets in an infected person 's breath			1
the very last stocks of the virus are held in two secure laboratories - one in the @entity95 and one in @entity97 - but some governments think there is a risk that the virus exists in other places			2
the @entity103 ( @entity103 ) can not assess the risk of an outbreak but is working to help governments prepare for the possibility			0
there is no cure for smallpox but a vaccine can be used effectively to prevent infection up to four days after a person has been exposed to the virus			1
a staggering 300 million people died from smallpox in the 20th century @entity116 : @entity103 he wrote : ‘ the researchers huddle around a mummified child half - submerged in thawing mud			0
they gently peel away a few layers of deerskin clothing to reveal blackened skin pocked with blemishes characteristic of smallpox pustules			0
‘ as they cut into a wizened leg , liquid oozes from the spongy flesh			0
’ later , the team doused the opened tomb with disinfectant to stop anyone accidentally carrying the virus out of the area			0
the disease is known to have ravaged populations in the @entity61 and elsewhere at the time and it is thought that evidence of the disease survives there simply because it is cold , while bodies have rotted away in warmer regions			2
some scientists think that bodies frozen in the north could be ' a fertile ground and a reservoir of the virus , ' @entity59 reported			1
smallpox is resilient when frozen and permafrost has previously yielded other types of living bacteria that are three million years old			0
last week , scientists announced they have successfully revived a 30,000 - year - old giant virus frozen in ice			2
the @entity33 and @entity97 researchers said that the virus is a type never seen before and warned that global warming could lead to more ancient viruses that can affect humans being uncovered			1
dubbed @entity163 , the virus was found in a 98ft ( 30metre ) deep sample of permanently frozen soil taken from coastal tundra in @entity168 , near the @entity169 , where the average annual temperature is minus 13.4 degrees @entity171 ( 7.8 degrees @entity172 )			2
the work shows that viruses can survive being locked up in the permafrost for extremely long periods , @entity33 's @entity32 ( @entity32 ) said in a press statement			0
' it has important implications for public - health risks in connection with exploiting mineral or energy resources in @entity185 regions that are becoming more and more accessible through global warming , ' it said			1
the revival viruses that are considered to have been eradicated , such as the smallpox virus ( pictured ) whose replication process is similar to that of a newly - discovered 30,000 - year - old virus , is no longer limited to science fiction , @entity33 's @entity32 ( @entity32 ) warned ' the revival of viruses that are considered to have been eradicated , such as the smallpox virus , whose replication process is similar to that of @entity163 , is no longer limited to science fiction			0
' the risk that this scenario could happen in real life has to be viewed realistically			0
' @entity201 , who examined the smallpox - scarred body found at the @entity63 said : ' if bacteria survive , i do n’t see why viruses do n’t survive			0
' another expert , @entity207 , an epidemiologist at @entity208 , said the hardiness of the smallpox and the expanse of frozen tundra means that it is possible that viable variola is preserved in permafrost			0
' if it were going to be anywhere ... [ the tundra ] would be the likely place , ' he said and experts think dry permafrost is probably where it would be found			2
however , scientists who have tried to excavate corpses with the tell - tale signs of smallpox in @entity226 and @entity21 have not recovered any viable viruses from them			1
the @entity103 told @entity229 : ' our experts can not confirm that live virus could be recovered from archaeological relics			2
a @entity95 @entity235 publication said that while living organisms in relics seem to be non-existent , ' nevertheless , archaeological specimens should be handled with caution			0
last week , scientists announced they have successfully revived a 30,000 year old giant virus frozen in ice			2
this is a close - up of the previously unknown virus infecting an amoeba cell			0
they warned that global warming could lead to more being uncovered ' each situation should be approached independently and with vigilance and attention '			1
dr @entity252 , @entity251 for @entity253 told @entity229 : ' although short lengths of smallpox viral dna has been detected in corpses in the permafrost in @entity21 and other preserved historical artefacts , no infectious virus has ever been obtained from archaeological remains			1
' there is no evidence that previously frozen corpses in the permafrost are a potential source of infectious smallpox virus			0
' @entity267 , retired director of the @entity235 and @entity269 ’s smallpox eradication programme , which ran during the 1970s and early 1980s , said : ‘ no one feels there 's a serious chance that global warming will melt the permafrost and unleash an epidemic			1
’ other scientists think that climate change actually reduces the chance of finding the smallpox virus , as it is unlikely that it could spend a number of days unfrozen			2
@entity281 , a senior fellow at the @entity282 , said : ' the gradual thawing of the permafrost brought about by global warming [ further diminishes ] the likelihood of recovering infectious smallpox virus particles from the corpses of victims buried in the @entity61 region			1
' @entity33 and @entity97 researchers identified the virus by taking a culture of amoebas found 30metres deep in the @entity21 permafrost , and adding some of the permafrost last week , scientists announced they have successfully revived a 30,000 year old giant virus frozen in ice			1

the team thawed the virus and watched it replicate in a culture in a petri dish , where it infected a simple single - cell organism called an amoeba			0
they found the cells exploded , and when examined under a microscope , showed the presence of a giant virus particle known as a pandovirus			2
radiocarbon dating of the soil sample found that vegetation grew there more than 30,000 years ago - a time when mammoths and @entity334 walked the @entity335 , according to a paper published in the @entity95 journal @entity337 ( @entity337 )			0
@entity339 is , on the scale of viruses , a giant -- it has 500 genes , whereas the influenza virus has only eight			0
it is the first in a new category of viral whoppers , a family known as @entity350 , for which two other categories already exist			0
@entity354 sibericum is harmless to humans and animals because for it only infects a type of amoeba called @entity359 , the researchers said			0

the disease , which causes a painful *blistering* rash and sometimes *blindness* and death , was wiped out in 1979
some experts fear defrosting bodies in @entity21 could potentially begin a cycle of infection , if a person makes contact with remains
defrosting bodies are coming to light as a result of global warming , although so far scientists have not found any remains with a virus in them
