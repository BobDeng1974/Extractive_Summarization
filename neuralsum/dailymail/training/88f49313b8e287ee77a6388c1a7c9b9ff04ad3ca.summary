there were 1,322 confirmed cases in @entity12 and @entity13 in september alone , 300 more than the total figure for 2011 when there were 1,118 cases , the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) said			1

babies are given a whooping cough jab when they are eight weeks old , but now the government recommends vaccinating pregnant women in total , 10 infants aged under three months have died in @entity12 as a result of the infectious disease			1
last month the @entity18 said it will offer the whooping cough vaccine to all pregnant women for the first time in the hope they will pass on protection to the foetus in the womb			1
at present , babies are given a whooping cough jab when they are eight weeks old , followed by boosters at three and four months			1
they can not have their vaccine any sooner as their immune systems are not developed enough for it to be effective			2
all nine babies who died from whooping cough this year have been under the age of eight weeks			1
if pregnant women are given the jab , they will make antibodies – proteins that fight infections – that are passed on to the foetus via the placenta			1
this will give the baby protection for the first few weeks of life			2
mothers are being offered the jab at between 28 and 38 weeks as experts believe this is when their antibodies will most effectively be passed to the newborns			0
the @entity53 insists that the injections are entirely safe and there is no risk they of harming the unborn baby or cause complications in the pregnancy			0

these are followed by a distinctive ' whooping ' noise			0
the coughing can last for around three months			0
other symptoms include raised temperature and vomiting after coughing			0
whooping cough is a cyclical disease with the number of cases peaking every 3 - 4 years			1
there is currently a peak occurring			0
whooping cough is caused by the bacterium bordetella pertussis , which can be passed from person to person through droplets spread by coughs and sneezes			2
it can be treated successfully with antibiotics and most people make a full recovery , however measures should be taken to stop it spreading			0
children with whooping cough should be kept away from school or nursery until they have taken antibiotics for five days			2
the same applies to adults returning to their workplace			0
young babies under the age of six months are likely to be admitted to hospital as they are most at risk of severe complications , such as serious breathing difficulties			0
