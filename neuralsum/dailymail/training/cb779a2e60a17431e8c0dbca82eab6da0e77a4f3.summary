he lives in one of the most glamorous cities on @entity3 , has an estimated £ 600million fortune and has his pick of the world 's most lavish hotels when he wants to go on holiday			0
but rather than join prince @entity9 and the @entity11 royals on the slopes in @entity13 , @entity15 's @entity14 has been enjoying a luxury break in @entity17			1
the 56 - year - old royal certainly proved a hit with locals , posing happily for photos with a policewoman and accepting a kiss from rugby player turned wrestler @entity25 while quaffing champagne in one of the resort 's bars			1
unfortunately for @entity14 's host , the game ended in a win for @entity47 - a result that the royal , who had been supporting the home team , described as ' disappointing '			1
drowning his sorrows with £ 160 bottles of @entity53 champagne at a @entity17 bar later that evening , @entity14 told owner @entity55 that he had hoped for a different outcome			1
' he was supporting @entity36 and said he was disappointed by the outcome of the game , ' explained mr @entity55 , who also revealed that the royal had remained at the bar until 2am			2
' i could n’t believe how friendly and down to earth he was			0
he is a really nice guy and he took the time to speak to everyone , including the staff			1
welcome to @entity17 ! @entity14 poses with a local policewoman during his holiday in @entity36 sporting action : @entity14 was left ' disappointed ' by the outcome of the @entity36 vs @entity47 rugby match ' it was an incredible weekend			1
the bar has been opened for five years , but this is the best weekend we have had so far			2
' @entity14 , who was staying at the five star @entity73 , spent saturday exploring the spectacular @entity76 peninsula and took in the region from the air during a 30 - minute helicopter tour			1
afterwards , he visited the local lifeboat station , where he was presented with a pair of knitted dolls for his two - month - old twins , prince @entity84 and princess @entity85			0
speaking afterwards , lifeboat captain @entity86 said the prince had enjoyed his tour			0
' he was interested in the lifeboat station and the new system we ’ve got , ' explained mr @entity86			0
' he was thrilled and thought the lifeboat was one of the best he had seen			0
' wrong result : the game , at the @entity94 in @entity37 , ended with a 16 - 21 victory for @entity47 beautiful : @entity17 sits on the edge of the @entity76 and is famous for spectacular beaches travels : @entity14 often travels for sport and is seen in @entity102 in 2012 ( left ) and watching petanque in 2013 @entity17 , which is famous for its spectacular sandy beaches , has long been a popular holiday destination and boasts a listed @entity107 pier			1
although not an obvious choice of destination for a visiting head of state , the area has hosted several royal visits , most notably from @entity113 in 1904			0
like @entity114 , @entity14 ended his visit to @entity36 with a trip to @entity117 , where he watched the local side take on @entity119 in the @entity120			2
after watching the teams draw 1 - 1 , the royal flew back to @entity15 to join his wife @entity123 , 36 , and their baby twins at the @entity126			0
home : on saturday night , @entity14 returned home to glamorous @entity15 and the @entity126 no thanks ! @entity14 decided not to join the @entity11 royals in @entity13 and went to @entity36 instead it might not be quite as glamorous as @entity131 but what @entity17 - and the surrounding @entity76 - lacks in glitz , it more than makes up for in natural beauty			1
highlights include the curving @entity136 which covers a six - mile stretch of @entity139 coastline and ends in @entity17 itself			2
along with its magnificent pier , which was built in 1898 , @entity17 is also home to the mediaeval @entity144 which was built in 1203 and glowers out over the village from its perch atop a hill			2
the majority of visitors , however , use their @entity17 break to explore the stunning @entity76 peninsula , a 70 square mile finger of land that juts out into the @entity154			1
its waters are home to an incredible array of wildlife , including whales and dolphins , while its dramatic coastline boasts a series of small rocky bays popular with daytrippers			0
striking : @entity166 is one of the @entity169 's most famously beautiful beaches stunning : @entity170 is another popular spot for day trippers hoping to enjoy its golden sand			0
