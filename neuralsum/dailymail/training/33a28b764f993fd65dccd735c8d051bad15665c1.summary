astronomers have spotted two monster stars about to merge in a stunning event that could reveal , for the first time , how supermassive stars are born			1
a @entity6 team reported the eclipsing of a star system , known as @entity9 , when they saw two huge stars circle in a very close orbit			1
the star system is nestled within a small open star cluster , named @entity14 1 , located about 13,000 light - years from @entity15			1
astronomers have spotted two monster stars about to merge in a stunning event that could reveal , for the first time , how supermassive stars are born ( artist 's impression pictured ) our sun is a relatively rare star in its isolation			1
most of the stars in our galaxy have been formed in binary or multiple systems , some of which are ‘ eclipsing ’			2
currently , the stars in @entity32 are moving around each other at speeds of 621,000 miles ( 1 million km ) per hour and are estimated to be no more than two million years old			1
each has a radius around 700 times bigger than the @entity15 's , but turns on itself at about the same time			1
by watching the two stars with the 7.2ft ( 2.2 metre ) telescope at the @entity42 , researchers were able to find out the temperature and shape of each of the stars			2

pictured is an artist 's impression of a binary star system the stars , which each have 38 and 32 times the mass of our sun , are also thought to complete orbits of each other in under 1.2 days			1
this means that their outer atmospheres are already touching and interacting , and are so close to each other that scientists believe they will eventually merge into one			1
the resulting star is estimated to have at least 60 times the mass of the sun , according to the study by the @entity73			0
galaxies like our @entity75 are made up of stars , dust and dark matter bound together by gravity			0
as galaxies drift through space , they periodically crash into each @entity84 and the other galactic stuff can merge together in these mash - ups you can call them celestial orphans , stars flung out of their galaxies in colossal collisions that have occurred in space for billions of years			1
these forsaken stars may be far more common than anyone ever realised			0
new observations from suborbital rocket launches and an orbiting observatory show that as many as half the stars in the universe may be this kind , scientists said in november			0
they found that the dim light these stars produce from the far reaches of the cosmos equals the amount coming from all the galaxies			1
the data was collected during 2010 and 2012 flights of a @entity112 suborbital rocket with the @entity113 ( @entity114 ) measuring background fluctuations in a compilation of all the light emitted by stars and galaxies in the universe 's history			1
the researchers then checked the findings using @entity124 , an orbiting infrared observatory			0
the data indicated huge numbers of orphan stars , previously undetected , populate what had been thought to be the dark spaces between galaxies			2
so how did billions of stars become orphans ? violently , to say the least			0

stars and the other galactic stuff can merge together in these mash - ups , but some stars that were born and resided in these galaxies are stripped away and cast as debris into the cosmic wilderness			1
the phenomenon of the orphan star has been well known			0
astronomers have witnessed tidal streams of stars being stripped away from colliding pairs of galaxies			0
scientists are unsure what will happen next , but any merger is likely to be rapid and explosive , releasing massive amounts of energy			0
while it wo n’t create a ‘ hypergiant ’ star , astrophysicists hope that by seeing the merger of such close binary stars , they can better explain how extremely massive stars form			2
@entity169 may be 100 or more times more massive than the sun , and emit hundreds of thousands of times more energy			0
although extreme stars such as these are believed to have been common in the early universe , today they are extremely rare - the entire @entity75 galaxy contains only a handful .			2

event could reveal , for the first time , how supermassive stars are born
star system is 13,000 light - years from @entity15 in a cluster called @entity14 1
my @entity189 stars are moving around each other at speeds of 621,000 *mph*
they are also thought to complete orbits of each other in under 1.2 days
their outer atmospheres are already touching , and will eventually merge
