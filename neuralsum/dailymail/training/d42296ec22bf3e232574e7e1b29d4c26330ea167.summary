the global super-rich are using loopholes to hide up to £ 20trillion from the taxman , a report said yesterday			0
the figure is more than the combined gross domestic product of the @entity6 and @entity7 and is a threat to the very essence of democracy , said campaigners			0
the report , @entity12 , shows how money is being siphoned into offshore banks instead of being invested at home			2
the report says secretive jurisdictions including @entity17 are receiving huge influxes of funds from a global super elite its author , @entity21 , a former chief economist at consultancy @entity22 , used data from the @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and central banks			1
his report gave a total of at least £ 13trillion , but said assets he had not been able to identify could make it as high as £ 20trillion			0
mr @entity21 said the assets of ‘ high - net - worth individuals ’ are being protected by ‘ professional enablers ’ taking advantage of gaps in cross-border tax rules			1
according to his calculations , £ 6.3trillion of assets are owned by 92,000 people – or 0.001 per cent of the world ’s population			0
@entity44 , of the international campaign group @entity45 , which commissioned the research , said : ‘ what the [ £ 13trillion ] figure does n’t include is the non-financial assets , the yachts , the jets , the works of art , the real estate			0
’ the @entity55 ranked highly in a list of nations where a large quantity of the huge sums are heading annually mr @entity44 added : ‘ i would say this is a defining moment for democracy , because unless people feel governments are treating taxpayers fairly our faith in democracy disappears			1
i know that people feel angry			0
’ a previous @entity69 compiled by the @entity45 ranks the jurisdictions enjoying an influx of capital in a @entity69			1
the top 10 private banks in the world including @entity75 were estimated to be managing around £ 4trillion in funds in 2010 in the table for 2011 , it suggests that @entity79 , the @entity55 , @entity80 and @entity17 are amongst the nations where a large amount of the huge sums are heading			1
and despite the popular perception of tax havens as being small isolated islands , the campaign group says that the biggest players in ' the supply of financial secrecy ' are almost all wealthy nations			1
the group also estimates that around $ 250bn is lost in taxes each year by governments worldwide as a result of the wealthiest individuals holding their assets offshore			0
the total value of the money being leaked from some nations even dwarfs the debts they often owe to the rest of the world			1
according to the @entity45 , the consequences of this tax avoidance are severe			2
' secrecy distorts trade and investment flows , and creates a criminogenic environment for a litany of evils that hurt the citizens of rich and poor countries alike			2
' it ’s not just developing countries that suffer : @entity117 countries like @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 have been brought to their knees by decades of secrecy and tax evasion			0
' estimates suggest that if the interest on the huge sums being lost were taxed at a rate of around 30 % , around £ 121bn would be generated for the treasuries around the world .			2

secretive jurisdictions including @entity79 and @entity17 have seen a huge influx of funds in recent years
meanwhile , *oil* - rich nations such as @entity136 and @entity137 are leaking vast sums of money to the tax havens
