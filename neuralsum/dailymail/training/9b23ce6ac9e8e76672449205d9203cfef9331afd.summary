symptoms include blood in your stools , an unexplained change in your bowel habits like prolonged diarrhoea or constipation and unexplained weight loss			2
it is the third most common cancer in the @entity46 with around 41,000 new cases in 2009			2
around three quarters of cases develop in the over- 65s			0
those with a close relative who had the disease are at much greater risk			0
people are at higher risk if they eat a diet high in saturated fat and low in fibre			0
obesity , lack of exercise , a high alcohol intake and smoking can also increase the risk			0
currently everyone aged 60 to 69 can be screened by sending a tiny stool sample in the post			0
this will soon be extended to the age of 75			0
within the next few years everyone will also be offered a camera examination of their lower bowel at the age of 55			2
