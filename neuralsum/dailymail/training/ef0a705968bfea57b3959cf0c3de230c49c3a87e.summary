it is a single moment of horrifying barbarism that provides a fleeting insight into the unimaginable hatred fuelling the war in @entity5			1
a young @entity5 rebel fighter barbecues the severed and blood - spattered head of a government soldier , lifting it triumphantly by the forelock as he poses for a picture			1
if this were not so stomach - churningly gruesome it would surely become one of the most enduring images of a conflict where the rules of war no longer apply and horror reigns ... if it is indeed real			2
while bloated and blood - stained , the face is relatively unmarked , its features , including a well - trimmed moustache , clearly recognisable			0
the image - which is too graphic to publish in its original form - was posted on a pro-government website hosted in @entity36 and billed as proof of a war crime			1
the boy in the picture is described as a member of the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) and the head that of an @entity45 - loyal helicopter pilot downed with his crew by a rebel surface - to - air missile			1
there is no way of categorically verifying this image - with modern photographic technology , it could have been doctored as easily as it was apparently taken			2
but if it is a fake , it sheds fresh light on a war where the line between truth and propaganda is blurred beyond recognition and the extraordinary lengths to which these enemies will go to undermine the other			0
joint force : members of @entity66 @entity5 rebel group @entity65 hold a detainee as they transport him in @entity69 province , eastern @entity5 in a picture taken on march 14 imminent death : free @entity42 militiamen arrest a ' traitor '			1
captured enemies of both sides more often than not suffer brutal executions in a war where rules no longer apply dr @entity79 , a middle east specialist at @entity81 , said - real or not - the picture reveals the sinister and growing role of @entity84 in a war where simple brute force is no longer a ticket to victory			2
where once battlefields were confined to rubble - strewn city streets , war - churned fields and dusty desert plains , they have spread online as both sides vie to control their public image and discredit that of their opposition			0
' with the conflict now more or less at stalemate , it is fast becoming a tit - for - tat war of propaganda over who is committing the most barbaric atrocities - both for the benefit of local and international communities			0
' the rebels have turned wholeheartedly to @entity109 to promote their mission , regularly posting pictures and videos of their fighters having been tortured or killed by @entity5 forces			2
desolate : a man walks along a damaged street filled with debris in @entity119 yesterday , which has seen heavy fighting in recent months warely bigger than his gun : a @entity5 boy holds an @entity124 assault rifle in @entity125 , left , and a young female fighter , right , takes a break from battle			1
it is a war that has incorporated everybody , irrespective of age or gender so young : a boy sells cigarettes on a street in @entity5 's northern city of @entity125			1
in the poorer neighbourhoods of @entity125 , immersed in conflict for the past nine months , it was not unusual even before the war for teenagers to go out to work , but now what little childhood remained for @entity125 youngsters has gone ' at the same time the government wants to justify to the world their line that they are fighting an @entity149 terrorist uprising			0
' it is an attempt to influence international policy by putting questions in countries like @entity156 's mind over whether they should be supporting such atrocities			0
' the website on which it was originally posted , goes on to list the names of the helicopter crewmen , claiming they were shot down as they travelled from @entity165 , on the country 's @entity167 coast , to deliver humanitarian aid supplies to villages inland			1
these ' martyrs ' allegedly all survived the subsequent crash , in @entity174 province , but were rounded up by the @entity42 's motley desert soldiers and all beheaded with butchers ' knives and paraded through the streets on sticks			2
a @entity5 human rights group says a key military unit loyal to president @entity45 is running secret prisons holding hundreds of suspected regime opponents			1
the @entity5 - based @entity184 said in a report today that the regime 's @entity186 runs detention centres in its bases in and around @entity190			2
the division is commanded by @entity192 , the president 's younger brother			0
it is considered a pillar of loyalist forces and is charged with defending the capital			0
the centre has tracked the dead , wounded and missing since the start of the uprising in march 2011			0
the claims could not be independently verified			0
other rights groups say tens of thousands of opposition members of their families have been detained during the two - year conflict			0
according to the @entity208 , they are named on the site as as general @entity210 , parachute major @entity211 , air force captain @entity212 , air force captain @entity213 , 1st lieutenant @entity215 , 1st lieutenant @entity216 , and @entity218 and @entity219			0
it is not clear to which of those men the head in the picture is supposed to belong			2
intriguingly , the website also implies that the executioners were @entity227 and their victim from the @entity230 sect of the @entity232 division of @entity232 to which president @entity45 belongs , @entity208 reports			1
perhaps this in itself is not so surprising , but it goes on to describe the perpetrators of the crime as ' @entity42 gangs ' , while most such atrocities have so far been carried out by @entity66 militants - not these ragtag - and mostly sectarian - militiamen			2
' that they call them " gangs " is interesting ' , said dr @entity79			0
' it is an attempt to show there is no structure to the rebel uprising - that they are just a collection of disparate groups with no real purpose			0
' the beheading element also plays into the government 's grand discourse by highlighting beheading as a jihadist practice , further discrediting the uprising in the eyes of the @entity259			0
' when approached by the @entity208 , @entity5 information minister @entity260 said he could not confirm the veracity of the picture			1
meanwhile , it emerged today that @entity149 militant group @entity264 is backing mercenaries from neighbouring @entity36 to protect @entity232 on the @entity5 side who claim their homes , villages and families have come under attack from @entity227 rebels			1
@entity264 chief sheik @entity273 , leader of many of @entity36 's @entity232 and a staunch ally of @entity5 president @entity45 , has said his group is supporting the cadres of fighters who call themselves @entity280			1
it is confirmation that the powerful @entity36 militant group is playing a growing role in the civil war just across the border			2
@entity5 's regime is dominated by minority @entity230 — an offshoot of @entity232 — while the rebels fighting to overthrow @entity45 are mostly from the @entity227 majority			1
@entity45 's major allies , @entity264 and @entity293 , are both @entity232			2
refugees : @entity36 @entity295 , center , said she had to flee the @entity5 border town of @entity298 along with her husband , seven sons and four daughters , and their families after their home and three shops repeatedly got hit during fighting ruthless campaign : @entity5 policemen performing during a live - fire military exercise			1
a @entity5 human rights group today said a key military unit loyal to president @entity45 is running secret prisons holding hundreds of suspected regime opponents under attack : a member of the @entity42 runs along with two men to take cover from snipers loyal to @entity5 's president @entity45 , in @entity119 yesterday the sectarian tensions in the civil war have spilled over to neighboring @entity36 , which has a similar ethnic divide and a long , bitter history of civil war and domination by @entity5			1
deadly gunbattles have broken out in @entity36 in recent months between supporters of both sides of the @entity5 war			1
but more broadly , @entity264 's deepening involvement shows how the @entity5 civil war is exacerbating tensions between @entity232 and @entity227 around the @entity333			2
@entity5 rebels accuse @entity264 of fighting alongside @entity45 's troops and attacking rebels from inside @entity36 territory			1
across the border : mercenaries loyal to @entity149 militant group @entity264 patrol neighbouring @entity36 to protect @entity232 on the @entity5 side who claim their homes , villages and families have come under attack from @entity227 rebels defence force : @entity264 's deepening involvement shows how the @entity5 civil war is exacerbating tensions between @entity232 and @entity227 around the @entity333 camouflaged : deadly gunbattles have broken out in @entity36 in recent months between supporters of both sides of the @entity5 war in recent months , fighting has raged in and around several towns and villages inhabited by a community of some 15,000 @entity36 shiites who have lived for decades on the @entity5 side of a frontier that is not clearly demarcated in places and not fully controlled by border authorities			1
they are mostly @entity36 citizens , though some have dual citizenship or are @entity5			1
before @entity5 's uprising erupted two years ago , tens of thousands of @entity36 lived in @entity5			1
the @entity36 @entity232 enclave on the @entity5 side of the border is near the central city of @entity370 and across from @entity371 , a predominantly @entity232 region of northeastern @entity36			1
one commander of the @entity280 said @entity232 villages have been repeatedly attacked and some residents have been kidnapped and killed by rebels			0
he said that prompted local @entity232 to take up arms to defend themselves			0
' we are in a state of defense			0
we do n't take sides ( between rebels and regime forces )			0
we are here to defend our people in the villages , ' said the commander , @entity386 , who gave only his first name out of fear for his own security			0
' we do n't attack any area			0
we only defend our villages			0

the picture was posted on a pro-government website in @entity36
the boy is described as a member of the @entity42 , aged about 20
the head belongs to downed @entity5 helicopter pilot , described as a ' martyr '
*unclear* whether it is real or doctored propaganda by @entity45 loyalists
meanwhile , rights group says @entity45 is running secret prisons for opponents
