by @entity0 published : 08:52 est , 25 april 2013 updated : 01:53 est , 26 april 2013 disgraced trainer @entity1 was banned for eight years for instigating the biggest drug scandal in @entity4 horseracing			1
the 15 horses given anabolic steroids in his @entity8 stable in @entity9 have been banned from running for six months — effectively ending their season			1
three other employees — an assistant vet and two yard foremen — were also involved in administering @entity14 and @entity15 to the horses , which are all owned by @entity17 , ruler of @entity18 and the biggest racehorse owner in @entity4			1
@entity8 ’s racing manager @entity26 said despite the massive embarrassment of an affair which has damaged the reputation of his boss , the @entity17 would not be reducing his commitment to the sport			1
but in a damning condemnation of @entity1 , who had sourced the performance - enhancing drugs in @entity18 , where he has admitted using them before , @entity26 said he did not believe @entity1 ’s explanation that he had not realised he was breaking the rules			1
scrum : 15 horses trained by @entity1 were also suspended on a damaging day for the sport it is permitted to use steroids on horses in @entity18 , providing they are not present in the system on raceday			1
the 37 - year - old , who gave the drugs to his horses on march 14 , cut a forlorn figure as he left the @entity51 ’s @entity50 base , his career in tatters			2
@entity26 , who said he had not considered resigning himself , admitted it will not be easy to restore @entity8 ’s tarnished reputation			2
‘ mr @entity1 said he had administered drugs before in @entity18 , where it is legal providing the horses do not race , ’ said @entity26			2
circus : @entity1 , centre , was surrounded by photographers as he arrived for his inquest back off : photographers mobbed the @entity8 trainer as he arrived for the @entity50 hearing @entity67 ( earnings : $ 19,262 ) certify ( $ 254,829 ) @entity68 ( $ 2,819 ) @entity69 of @entity70 ( $ 2,088 ) @entity71 ( $ 68,952 ) @entity72 ( $ 1,671,075 ) @entity73 ( $ 21,230 ) total prize money : $ 2m ( £ 1.31m ) ... and the four new names @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 ‘ he did it at the beginning of last winter			1
he did it on a small number of horses — less than 10 in pre-training — and assured me all the horses stayed in @entity18			0
sheik @entity17 was completely unaware of this			0
‘ it goes without saying that this is a terrible situation for @entity4 racing and an absolutely awful situation for @entity8			1
‘ mr @entity1 has acted with awful recklessness and he has caused tremendous damage not only to @entity8 but also @entity4 racing			1
for that , we are deeply sorry			0
it will take a very long time for @entity8 to regain the public ’s confidence			2
‘ for sheik @entity17 , racing is fun and there is no fun attached to this			0
i very much hope this does not leave a dark stain that he feels puts him a difficult position			0
' rocked : 1,000 guineas hope @entity107 was one of 11 horses to test positive and will not run in the @entity110 @entity112 and stanozolol boost muscle growth and fat loss - they are man - made anabolic steroids			1
@entity15 is more commonly taken by athletes and bodybuilders - either by injection or in tablet form			0
@entity112 is similar to nandralone and can aid recovery from injury			0
he added : ‘ he has tremendous passion for horses and horseracing			0
i ’m sure he will want to get everything right as soon as he can at @entity129 and continue his racing stables			0
but , in the short term , we have to re-structure			0
’ @entity26 read a statement on @entity1 ’s behalf which said : ‘ first and foremost i would like to apologise to his highness sheik @entity17 as well as to all those involved with @entity8 and the public who follow @entity4 racing			1
‘ i accept that it was my responsibility to be aware of the rules regarding the use of prohibited substances in @entity4			2
i can only apologise and repeat what i said in my statement earlier in the week			0
i have made a catastrophic error			0
’ bad news , boss : @entity8 owner @entity17 ( left ) with trainer @entity1 @entity8 had already announced all horses in @entity1 ’s care would not run until they had been dope tested and cleared			1
at least a degree of independence was introduced when it was announced the @entity51 would be involved in the testing procedures.but the haste of this inquiry — just three days after the positive tests emerged — leaves an an uneasy feeling , one which @entity51 chief @entity160 attempted to quell by suggesting the governing body would be rigorous in seeing @entity8 put their house in order			1
@entity160 said : ‘ we are not saying this is the end of it , but it is the end of the beginning			0
we will also provide advice to @entity8 of necessary changes to its procedures and controls where appropriate — this will be supported by @entity8 ’s own review			2
scandal : 2012 @entity178 winner @entity177 was also trained by @entity1 ‘ naturally , the @entity51 also consider the wider issues raised by this matter and we will work to ascertain and collate all other relevant information including , where necessary , interviewing other employees and contractors of @entity8			1
’ whether this leads to further charges remains to be seen but a sceptical wider world will take some convincing that this unsavoury incident was confined to four bad apples in the @entity8 empire			2
the first chapter of this tawdry affair is closed and the villain of the piece , a man who had previously worked for a trainer who himself fell foul of the drugs testers , has exited			0
the once rising star of the team will probably be airbrushed from @entity8 history			2
his 192 winners a cause of embarrassment rather than pride .			0
