@entity1 's commons comeback moved a step closer tonight after he was selected to fight a safe @entity4 seat at the general election			1
the @entity7 mayor saw off three rivals - one of whom was born in the constituency - to win the support of party members in @entity14 and @entity15			1
in a blaze of publicity rarely afforded to a vote in a school hall , reporters mobbed the mop - haired mayor in the car park as odds on him becoming the next prime minister shortened to 6/1			1
back in the fold : @entity1 at @entity26 tonight , where he was selected to fight the safe seat of @entity14 and @entity15 at next year 's general election - despite still being @entity7 's mayor until 2016 mini-celebrity : unlike almost any other @entity4 selection in history , mr @entity1 was mobbed by reporters as he arrived in the cart park of @entity26 , wearing a rucksack and accompanied by his wife @entity37 ' i am obviously thrilled , ' he said , playing down suggestions he had his eyes set on the @entity4 leadership - a prospect on which @entity43 is offering odds of 2/1			1
he added : ' it will be a tough fight , it will be a long fight			0
but i have no doubt whatever that we are going to be able to return @entity50 and the conservatives with an absolute majority in 2015			0
' this is @entity54 , scene one of a very long process and what i have got to do now is have a lot of talks with people here in @entity14 and @entity15 , get to know people , get to know the association better			0
there 's a lot of digging in to be done			0
' he admitted that he had no immediate plans to relocate to the constituency			0
' i live in @entity7 , ' he said			2
' i have got a home in @entity7			2
i do n't rule it out but it wo n't happen immediately			0
' before the ballot , mr @entity1 and his three rivals made a behind - closed doors pitch to party members in the hall at @entity26			1
mr @entity1 won outright on the first count , without the need for a second round			0
criticism : mr @entity80 insisted he was not going back on his word by saying @entity7 was out of recession the mayor 's bid survived concerns over his determination to see out his full @entity88 term despite it running until 2016 , a year after he may become an mp			1
critics said he could not do both jobs at once to the best of his ability , citing a 2012 ' solemn vow ' in which he said leading the capital out recession ' can not be combined with any other political capacity '			2
but he insisted he was not going back on his word - by saying @entity7 was already out of the doldrums			1
last night he insisted : ' it has been done before and i see no reason why it should n't be done again			0
' i would point out that it is possible to be both an mp and have a very big job such as foreign secretary or prime minister at the same time			0
' the colourful politician 's decision to return to @entity110 has stoked speculation over his hopes to succeed @entity50 as @entity114 leader			2
no contest : @entity14 and @entity15 is only @entity117 's 392nd target seat and the mayor is widely expected to win - with @entity43 making him the 1/50 favourite , and 2/1 to be the next leader of the @entity114 the prime minister insists , however , that he would be delighted to have the mayor back in @entity123 , saying he wants his ' star players on the pitch '			1
mr @entity1 , a former editor of the political magazine @entity126 , previously served as mp for @entity127 for seven years before leaving to take up the @entity88 reins in 2008			0
he will defend a majority of 11,216 in the north - west @entity7 constituency held by former deputy chief whip sir @entity131 , who is stepping down			1
the others in the frame for the selection were the deputy leader of the local council @entity137 , deputy leader of @entity138 , who was born in the constituency , and @entity140 - born barrister @entity139			2
praising the quality of his opponents , he said : ' it was a very enjoyable selection process and i want also to pay tribute to the other three candidates who were here who were all very good indeed and i am sure they will go on to get good seats			0
' the seat is only @entity117 's 392nd target seat and the mayor is widely expected to win - with @entity43 making him the 1/50 favourite			1
and the bookmaker 's odds on mr @entity1 becoming the next @entity4 leader are now 2/1			1
his high profile could , however , attract a wide church of fringe candidates to compete against him .			0

@entity7 mayor saw off three rivals despite vow to do both jobs at once
he was selected in a private meeting at @entity26 , west @entity7
safe @entity4 seat makes his return to @entity170 likely after seven - year gap
@entity43 put odds of winning seat at 1/50 - and 2/1 for next @entity4 leader
