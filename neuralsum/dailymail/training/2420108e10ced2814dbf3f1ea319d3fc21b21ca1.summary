but the hosts did , with great resilience , show that the @entity17 club are not unstoppable and , in doing so , gave a glimmer of hope to challengers that the season is not blue all over just yet			0

@entity4 beat @entity80 ’s @entity5 in the clubs ’ last two meetings			1
they inflicted @entity5 ’s last defeat , at @entity84 in the league in april and @entity4 also won the meeting before , a home game in the @entity88 last december			1
the visitors poured forward from the first whistle and it was clear that @entity22 ’s game - plan was rooted in containment and counter-attacks			0
the first six minutes exemplified this with @entity5 pressure then a break ending in @entity42 setting up @entity45 , whose shot was blocked			1

and then the blue waves came again			0
the sturdy home defending should not have been such a shock			0
take away the 8 - 0 drubbing by @entity121 and , before saturday , @entity4 had conceded just 11 goals - the second - lowest tally in the division			2
@entity39 ’s perfectly timed tackle on @entity31 to cut off the clear and present danger from a beautiful through ball from @entity127 was symbolic of the defiance and application			2
the pre-match talk was about whether @entity5 can be invincible all season , as only @entity132 in 1888 - 89 and @entity133 in 2003 - 04 have ever been in @entity135 ’s top division			1
they certainly have match - winners in all areas			0

and then @entity4 came the closest either side came to scoring in the first half			1
@entity148 fed @entity37 , whose chip from inside the area clipped the bar and tipped over the top			0
with the home fans urging them on , @entity4 pushed on again			2
the longer @entity5 went without scoring , the more @entity31 became frustrated and tetchy			1
late in the first half , after a tangle with @entity39 , he kicked out			0
that he missed his target is irrelevant and he was fortunate not to be booked			2
he did , however , receive a yellow card in the 55th minute for knocking @entity38 in the face with his trailing arm while jumping			2
