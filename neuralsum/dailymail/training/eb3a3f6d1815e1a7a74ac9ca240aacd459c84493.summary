the father , who is well know for his stance on supporting the gay community and his irreverent and witty signs that often fly in the face of the traditional views , believes mr @entity15 is clearly in possession of a very limited biblical theology			1
' while the biblical narrative does have a negative view of what we recognize as ' homosexual ' behaviour , the writers have no concept of what we now understand as sexual orientation , ' he said			0
' mostly where there is a negative view it has more to do with pagan worship and marital infidelity than it does with what we understand a homosexuality			0
' pro-gay @entity221 priest @entity220 ( pictured ) has called pastor @entity15 an embarrassment to the @entity5 faith father @entity220 ( pictured ) is known for his pro-gay stance and his creative signs out front of his @entity221 church at @entity258 on the @entity259 @entity223			1
he says the email response is ' unbelievably disgraceful ' a sign liked by father @entity220 ' the reference to @entity263 ( @entity264 19 ) is again a misrepresentation of the text , as the sin of @entity268 has nothing to do with homosexuality and everything to do with the denial of hospitality			2
' ' in this context mr @entity15 is more the @entity268 than mr @entity6			1
if mr @entity15 wishes to take the @entity26 seriously rather than literally ( you ca nâ€™t do both ) he may wish to consider @entity277			2
' ' with it ( our tongue ) we bless our @entity104 and @entity220 , and with it we curse men , who have been made in the likeness of @entity27 ; from the same mouth come both blessing and cursing			0
my brethren , these things ought not to be this way			0
does a fountain send out from the same opening both fresh and bitter water ? can a fig tree , my brethren , produce olives , or a vine produce figs ? nor can salt water produce fresh			0
' ' effectively mr @entity15 has sought to curse mr @entity6 and the problem with that is curses have a nasty habit of bouncing back on you			1
' ' mr @entity15 is an embarrassment to the @entity5 faith and i wonder how much harm he has done to other people			1
another biblical verse comes to mind , ' @entity64 wept '			0
