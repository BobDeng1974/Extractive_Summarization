by @entity0 published : 12:21 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 12:27 est , 25 september 2013 they look like everyday objects - a corn of cob , some matchsticks and a wine cork			1
but peer a little closer and these mundane objects so typically overlooked contain an entire world - that is , if @entity10 artist @entity9 has anything to do with it			1
from an ice cream cone to a man 's shaving brush , the imaginative architect , 32 , creates familiar scenes from films and everyday life using food and household objects as substitutes for the scenery			1
' spring break on a plate ' : cauliflower , biscuits and fruit loops cereal are used to create a vision of palm trees , rubber rings and sandy beach bars in this particular piece hikers struggle to reach the peak of this corn cob ' mountain ' while ' @entity38 ' shows a man wading through the ' grass ' of a brush to hunt down a stag he photographs tiny figurines in his carefully constructed sets to create a series of eye - catching images			1
just one of the mini marvels can take @entity9 , from @entity50 , @entity10 , up to three days to complete as he painstakingly arranges and lights the scenes in his home office turned studio			1
he said : ' i started my work this year , the project is called @entity57			2
' i am an architect and i wanted to use my skills to create something which shows humans in a surreal , macro world			1
under fire : soldiers walk through a paint - splattered war zone , shielding themselves as they are attacked from above dancing in the rain ! a ballet dancer gracefully spins while surrounded by water encircling her - the illusion of a rainy day was created by placing her on top of a shower head ' my work can be a way to draw attention to the small details of our daily life using foods and daily objects as a scenery			1
' i buy small dolls which i use in each of my images			2
i use the dolls and create a scene for them using everyday objects or food			1
' in some cases i try to do a remake of a movie scene			2
' depending on the scene , i can spend anywhere between one and three days creating each image			0
' in one image neighbours can be seen mowing and trimming their ' gardens ' , which are actually hairy cocount shells			0
another different world shows a pair of spacesuit - clad people trekking through a wild territory to investigate a body in a time - shell - but further inspection reveals that it is a pair of models wading through spaghetti to peer inside half of a cherry tomato			0
abandon ship : a scene from @entity107 is produced using upside down wafer cones , with blocks of ice creams , as a replica of the ship sinks in the background			0
all aboard ! these figures dash between the pillars of a train station - which is actually made up of wine corks carefully balanced on a wooden floor @entity119 is given a whole new spin as the steps with the buggy falling down the steps are actually stairs made from crackers for another of his images , @entity9 uses the inside of a watermelon as the setting for a scene showing the first man on @entity133 and in another he uses ice - cream cones as icebergs to show the sinking of the @entity107			1
' i have a home office , which doubles up as a studio , but i 'm looking for a place outside of my house to continue my work , ' he said			0
' the main difficulties i face when creating my work are when i use food to create the scenarios as the food spoils easily			1
' for example for the image called @entity107 , i used real ice cream , so i had to study the lighting before as the ice cream melts too fast			0
into the unknown : spacemen wade across the alien land to inspect a time capsule - created from strands of pasta and cherry tomatoes emergency ! firefighters tackle a blaze in a matchbox , as they try and clamber through a smouldering pile of charred matchsticks tending to the fields : miniature mowers tend to their coconut lawns as they snip hairs on the shells and rake in the straggly fine threads party time ! these dancers are surrounded by bright lights and look like they 're having fun - undoubtedly helped by the thrill of perching on a bunch of grapes ' every scene that i imagine is a challenge			0
most of the time , when i 'm producing the scene , it ends up a little bit different than i first imagined			0
' my favourite image is the " shaving brush @entity38 " because of the simplicity of the image , it 's simple but at the same time it is also a strong image			0
' i also like the " @entity190 " because of the composition			0
' since the beginning of this year i 've been working full time on my photography creating images for the art and advertising markets			2
' ' for me , this project is great			0
i 'm loving this series			2
' it is constantly a work in progress as i continue to come up with new ideas for scenes			2
