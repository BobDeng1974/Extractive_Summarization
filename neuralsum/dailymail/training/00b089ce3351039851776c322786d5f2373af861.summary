she said : ' it is clear that complaints were made to schools by a number of girls on a number of occasions , but nobody took any , or any adequate , steps to ensure that this defendant was stopped from preying on girls in his charge			2
' for many years mr @entity2 was not brought to book , either because a complaint was not made or because those in authority , who could have pursued matters , did not			1
' the latest charges relate to a period when @entity2 worked first at @entity61 , in @entity62 , east @entity7 , from 1964 to 1974 , and then at @entity14 , also east @entity7 , until 2007			2

ms @entity32 said the paedophile ' selected his victims with care , groomed them , and made them feel they were responsible for what was happening			2

bad move : @entity2 was jailed in 2010 , but made the mistake of asking a woman he abused for a character reference during the trial , after which she and another 30 victims came forward scene : mr @entity2 abused young girls at @entity61 in east @entity7 , one 14 - year - old victim called him ' possessive looking back , she told police he was a ' possessive control freak			1

@entity2 also put his hands down another girl 's underwear as she auditioned for a singing part in a school show , while another said he was ' known throughout the school as a perv '			1
horror lesson : @entity2 told victim ' if you sing the notes right this would n't be happening , ' the @entity28 heard ' given that most of the girls who attended music lessons were aware of the defendant 's behaviour , it is hard to understand why no members of staff shared their suspicions , ' said the prosecutor said			1
judge @entity152 said @entity2 's crimes had left a ' real and lasting impact ' on his victims , one of whom became anorexic around the time of his abuse , with several going on to suffer depression			1
' it was a prolonged and manipulative campaign of sexual abuse , ' she said			0
' there are themes running through these statements , reflecting the anger of these women at the way he took over their lives			0
it is clear that several of them believe his actions have affected their relationships in later life			0
' in a statement , one victim described ' feeling self - loathing , because he was manipulating her into doing this , and she was powerless to stop him			0
' another said she was now paranoid about the safety of her own children			0
