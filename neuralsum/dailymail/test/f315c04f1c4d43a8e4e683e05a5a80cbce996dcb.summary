the family of a murdered mother have spoken of their fury after it was revealed that she tried to call 999 hours before she was killed but call handlers failed to alert police			1
@entity7 , 45 , was viciously beaten and strangled to death by @entity9 , who she met only weeks earlier on dating site @entity10			1
the pair had been drinking at the pub before she returned to her home in @entity15 near @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , when @entity9 , 47 , followed and attacked in an alcohol - fuelled rage			2
he was jailed for a minimum of 17 and a half years in february he only called paramedics the following morning and claimed he thought ms @entity7 was sleeping , but later admitted murder and was jailed for life in february			1
police have since told the family that the mother - of - two made a 999 call from her mobile just after she returned from the pub , which went through to @entity35 to deal with			1
operators at the telecommunications company connects both mobile and landline numbers with the requested emergency service and follow strict protocol			0
but when ms @entity7 called on september 13 , last year , the call handler said they could not hear anything and therefore did not connect the call to the police or send help			1
her mother , @entity48 , 74 , and sister @entity49 , 49 , have slammed @entity35 for not taking action at the time which they claim could have saved their sister			2
however , @entity35 says its handlers acted appropriately and in line with police guidance not to pass on calls where there is ' nothing to indicate there is any problem '			0
mrs @entity48 said : ' when we found out @entity7 had been murdered our whole world fell apart			1
' but as we were starting to come to terms with it all , to then hear that a 999 call had been made from her mobile the night she died , it stirred up all of those emotions we had felt when we first found out @entity7 had been killed			1
her family ( mother , @entity48 , left , and sister , @entity49 , right ) were told by police that she had tried to make a 999 call just hours before her murder but the call was ended when operated got no response ms @entity7 ( left ) had been drinking in the pub with @entity9 ( right ) when he followed her home on september 13 , last year			1
he did n't call paramedics until the following morning , claiming he thought she was asleep ' it left us feeling sick to the stomach , devastated and fuming , knowing no one was there for @entity7 when she needed help			1
' if they had got to her in time @entity7 might still be alive			1
she could have been here today			0
now we 'll always wonder if that may have been possible			0
' police confirmed a 999 call was made from her mobile phone to @entity35 at around 7pm but it was disconnected after around 13 seconds and officers were not informed			1
@entity98 and her partner @entity97 leaving @entity99 following the trial of their daughter 's killer , @entity9 the phone call was later enhanced by detectives , who discovered arguing could be heard in the background			0
ms @entity7 's family are calling on @entity35 to review their procedures , and answer questions about the call			1
mrs @entity48 said : ' apparently the person who picked up believed there was silence at the end of the line			0
they must have assumed 999 had been dialled accidentally			0
' it does n't bear thinking about what might have happened if @entity35 had connected the call to the police			1
' ms @entity7 's sister , mrs @entity49 , a catering supervisor , added : ' you regularly hear of toddlers playing with their mum 's mobile phone and ringing the emergency services by mistake			1
' in those instances , the police often seem to trace the call and turn up on the doorstep			1
' we want to know why that did n't happen when in this situation @entity7 so desperately needed their help			1
' we know the police are n't to blame as they never received the call , but @entity35 should be looking into this and reviewing their policies			1
' the call might have been muffled or quiet at the other end of the line , but surely it 's better to put it through to the police so they can send an officer and be safe rather than sorry			2
' who knows what the outcome might have been if they had reached her in time ? we do n't want any other families to lose a loved one and go through the pain we have			0
' a @entity35 spokesman said : ' @entity160 contacted @entity35 on september 24 , 2014 about whether we received an emergency call from a mobile phone number and we provided them with full details including a call recording			0
' our records show that we received the call at approximately 19.07 on september 13 , 2014			0
' there was no response to our operator 's questioning and our operator heard nothing to indicate there was any problem before the caller ended the call after about 13 seconds			2
' police forces have requested that we do not connect such calls to them and our operator correctly followed the call handling process requested by the police			2
' ms @entity7 's family ( pictured outside court ) are calling on @entity35 to review their procedures following the call the 999 emergency number was set up in @entity189 in june 1937 after five women were killed in a fire			1
a committee discussed how telephone operators could identify emergency calls and the easy to remember 999 number was born			0
it was later rolled out in @entity197 and extended to all major towns and cities by 1948			0
since then it has expanded massively with an average of 597,000 calls a week across the @entity202			0
@entity35 operators answer the initial call from both landlines and mobiles and find out which emergency service is required before connecting the caller			0
the handler has to quickly establish whether the call is genuine before transferring them			2
in instances where they are met with silence they ask the caller to respond by either making a noise or coughing			0
this can narrow down the number of accidental or prank calls made , which account for about half of the 31 million calls made annually			0
of the remaining 15.5million , 52 per cent go to police , 41 per cent to ambulance service , six per cent for fire and one per cent to the coastguard and cave and mountain rescue services			0

he said : ' during the early evening of september 13 , 2014 , a 999 call was made from the mobile phone of @entity7			1
' the phone call was received by the telephone company operator and managed in accordance with their policy but not directed onto @entity160 , nor in fact any police force			2
' i understand the circumstances surrounding the management of this phone call are now being reviewed by the @entity253 following a request by @entity7 's family			1
' it was not until the early hours of the following morning , at 2.35am , that @entity257 called emergency services , claiming that he thought she was sleeping off the alcohol and he was unable to wake her			0
but paramedics who arrived at the house found she had been dead for some time and there was also evidence he had tried to cover up the killing , @entity260 was told			0
a post mortem examination revealed that her cause of death had been blunt force trauma to the head and asphyxiation			2
@entity9 had denied killing his girlfriend when interviewed by police , but in december last year admitted the murder			2
