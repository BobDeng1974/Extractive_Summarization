@entity6 , 23 , from @entity7 , used to skip meals and refused to eat anything he had n't tried before			1
he said : ' from a young age i had a severe fear of foods i had n't tried before			0
i would tell myself i did n't like them or there was something wrong with them before i had even tried them			0
' i could still play sports and run around without feeling the need for food so the slimmer and slimmer i became			0
' bulked up : @entity6 was skinny as a teenager , left , as he was afraid to eat foods he had n't tried before but transformed his figure after he had to change his eating habits to be able to lift weights @entity6 said teachers at his school tried to help him by encouraging - and sometimes tricking him - to eat			1
however , it did n't work and as he grew skinnier , his self - esteem plummeted as he felt self - conscious about his eating habits and slim figure			1
' in my early teens it became a bigger problem because people were always shocked by how i would n't eat at parties or restaurants and would only eat things i had tried before			1
beat his demons : @entity6 has now qualified as a personal trainer as he wants to help others who suffer from eating disorders learn about good nutrition ' i would be ridiculed and embarrassed and it made me feel i was n't the same as the others , ' he said			1
' my ambition was to get a better body and not to feel weak , different and embarrassed			0
i had to force myself to eat new things ' the turning point came when @entity6 became interested in fitness and wanted to start working out by lifting weights			1
however , he found he was n't capable of this without fuelling his body by eating properly			0
he explains : ' when i became interested in fitness it became compulsory to eat new foods			2
i was finding that no matter how i hard i worked , or how many hours spent in the gym , not eating right and not eating for a while was working against me			0
confidence boost : the 23 - year - old used to be embarrassed by his figure but now wants to model then breakfast : @entity65 : a few @entity66 : a small portion of spaghetti now breakfast : oatmeal and a @entity71 - morning : two @entity72 : tuna , rice and salad , two slices wholemeal @entity73 : chicken breast with sweet potatoes and @entity80 : whey protein shake with a tablespoon of peanut butter he will also take @entity86 supplements through out the day ' my ambition was to get a better body and not to feel weak , different and embarrassed			2
i had to force myself to eat new things			0
' my desire to get away from my skinny self became greater than being afraid of trying new foods - so i beat my eating disorder because my goal of feeling and looking better was stronger than my fear			0
' after changing his diet and taking protein supplements from @entity100 , who are now his sponsors , @entity6 began to gain weight and became strong enough to work out for 45 minutes in the gym three days a week			1
as a result , his figure is now completely transformed , he has defined pecs and an impressive six pack			2
he now wants to compete in natural bodybuilding competitions and has qualified as a personal trainer so he can help others get fit			1
he said : ' my goals for the future are to own gym , compete in competitions and appear in muscle model campaigns to show how far i have come and show how if i can do it , anyone can			0
