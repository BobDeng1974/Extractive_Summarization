@entity0 is facing another backlash from users and privacy campaigners after announcing it is once again changing its privacy settings			1
up until now @entity0 let people hide their profiles in search results using the ' who can look up your timeline by name ? ' setting , but the social networking site is retiring this feature with almost immediate effect			1
the option was removed from the accounts of people who had n't enabled it last year , and @entity0 has announced it is removing the feature from everyone else 's accounts starting from now			1
@entity0 began removing the ' who can look up your timeline by name ? ' feature on accounts which were n't using it last year , but is now retiring it completely			1
this means users can no longer remove themselves for search results on the site when people who are n't their friends try to find them users who still have the old setting will soon see a notice on their homepage warning them the feature is being removed			1
the best way for users to control what people can find about them is to choose an ' audience ' for each of the individual things that are shared			0
in the coming weeks , people who share posts publicly on @entity0 will also see a notice reminding them those posts can be seen by anyone , including people they may not know			2
they will also be given guidance on how to change the audience for each post			0
to quickly control who can find previous posts , users can go to @entity60 page and click ' limit the audience of posts you ’ve shared in the past '			0
this means any posts that were previously shared with @entity65 will now be shared just to friends			0
@entity67 , head of social media and content for @entity70 told @entity71 : ' in a world where privacy is significant issue for many users , this is a massive step backwards for @entity0 and may contribute to even more users quitting the site			2
' twitter user @entity79 tweeted : ' just realised @ facebook changed privacy settings so anyone can message me			0
i 'm so annoyed with their lack of concern for user privacy / safety			0
while @entity91 added the changes highlighted ' yet another privacy setting lost ; good news for stalkers			0
' the ' who can look up your timeline by name ? ' feature was applied when people searched for someone 's profile using @entity0 's search bar			1
depending on the setting chosen , the profile was either completely hidden from everyone who was n't already a @entity0 friend ; could only be seen by friends of friends or was only visible to certain groups or networks of people			1
according to @entity0 's chief privacy officer , @entity113 : ' the setting was created when @entity0 was a simple directory of profiles and it was very limited			1
' it did n’t prevent people from navigating to your timeline by clicking your name in a story in @entity120 , or from a mutual friend ’s timeline			0
' he added that following the launch of @entity0 's @entity126 last year , which lets people find more specific details about site members , it 's important for users to be able to control the privacy of the information shared , rather than how people get to their timeline			1
according to @entity0 's chief privacy officer , @entity113 , the setting was created when @entity0 was a simple directory of profiles			1
following the launch of @entity0 's @entity126 last year , pictured , the site now wants users to take control over the individual pieces of personal data they share , not just their overall profile with @entity126 , people can now search for ' users that like rock music in @entity149 ' , for example , or ' vegetarians in @entity152			1
' @entity0 ultimately wants people to take greater control over the individual pieces of personal data they share on the site , not just the overall profile			2
according to @entity159 : ' the launch of @entity0 is no longer content with being ' just a social network ' and wants to rival the likes of @entity162 and @entity163 in the search market			0
' the difference for @entity0 is that whilst @entity162 and @entity163 have a plethora of website data , @entity0 has the majority of real - use information			0
' it knows where you went on holiday , who your past relationships were with , even what brands and tv shows you like			0
by making this data more accessible and removing privacy barriers , @entity0 can make @entity126 more attractive to potential advertisers			2
' @entity181 , a media law expert from @entity182 continued : ' @entity0 is clearly trying to close a privacy loophole as people are increasingly aware of their privacy rights			1
however , the trend we are seeing is actually for people to share more and more info about themselves - @entity190 being perhaps the best example of this			0
' @entity193 , ‎ vice president of privacy products at @entity194 told @entity71 : ' keeping up with @entity0 's constantly changing privacy framework and policies is beyond most people			2
' @entity0 's business objective is to make information as widely available as possible for commercial purposes , which for many people conflicts with the desire to share mostly with only close family and friends			0
' @entity0 clings to the myth that they are n't changing the privacy framework when they make our profiles and activity more easily searched and indexed			2
the fact is , @entity0 's default rules make my profile available to more than a billion other people , so when they make it easier to find and search , they are changing the balance of privacy and people should understand this			2

@entity0 is retiring the ' who can look up your timeline by name ? ' setting
it removed the privacy option on accounts that were n't using it last year
people who have the feature enabled will soon see the setting *disappear*
