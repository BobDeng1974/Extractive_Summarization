write caption here authorities say @entity14 , 22 , originally lied about the tot ’s injuries , saying another child – who is 18 months old – pulled @entity30 off the couch and caused the injuries , @entity33 reported , citing the affidavit			1
he then recanted the tale when told of the severity of @entity30 ’s injuries to say he dropped and accidentally fell on the baby while her a bath			1
she then slowly began to die of suffocation as @entity14 waited two days to call police because he was afraid he would get in trouble			2
