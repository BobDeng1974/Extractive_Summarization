@entity1 dust may have ruined an attempt to detect what happened in the first billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second after the @entity9			2
the discovery was made in march when scientists believed they had glimpsed a very brief moment at the beginning of everything when the universe expanded - a theory called cosmic inflation			2
but the incredible find was soon dismissed by other research groups who thought the @entity22 team in may have underestimated the effects of dust in the galaxy			1
shown here is the pattern observed with the @entity33 telescope , providing what was thought at the time to be evidence for cosmic inflation after the @entity9			1
the results have now been called into question scientists view the the universe as being made up of a ' fabric of space - time '			0
this corresponds to @entity46 's @entity45 which was published 1916			0
objects in the universe bend this fabric , and more massive objects bend it more			0
gravitational waves are considered ripples in this fabric			2
they can be produced for instance , when black holes orbit each other or by the merging of galaxies			0
gravitational waves are also thought to have been produced during the @entity9			1
now , that explanation has been given more credit following a recent study by the @entity65 ’s @entity64 satellite			1
their research suggests the part of the sky observed by the @entity71 team had more cosmic dust than had previously been estimated			1
it builds on two other independent studies that suggest the twisting patterns thought to be something known as ' gravitational waves ' from the early universe could just as easily be accounted for by the dust			1
while this is another blow to the @entity22 team ’s findings , it does n’t mean their work is completely wrong			1
@entity22 and @entity64 teams are now working together for a final assessment to be released by next year			2
scientists , from left , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity93 - @entity92 and @entity95 smile during a news conference at the @entity97 in @entity98 to announced their groundbreaking results on gravitational waves in march the incredible find was soon dismissed by other research groups who thought the @entity22 team in may have underestimated the effects of dust in the galaxy			1
now , that explanation has been given more credit following a recent study by the @entity65 's @entity64 satellite ( pictured ) their research centered on a theory by that @entity46 when something very explosive happens it leaves ripples in space - time known as ' gravitational waves '			1
the very first gravitational waves can tell us about the birth of the universe and scientists have discovered they leave imprints in cosmic microwave background radiation - the afterglow of the @entity9 - as they pass through space			1
the theory suggests that this initial spurt would have taken the infant universe from something infinitely small to something close to the size of a marble			0
earlier this year experts believed they had seen these gravitational waves and hailed the experiment as a massive step forward - but admitted the theory needed more work			2
' it 's just unbelievable quite honestly , ' professor @entity140 , who helped build the instrument that detected the waves , told @entity144 at the time			0
' this is confirming what is , to me , a wacky idea			0
' this graphic shows the universe as it evolved from the @entity9 to now			0
@entity152 scientists believe that the universe expanded from subatomic scales to the astronomical in just a fraction of a second after its birth the finding by the @entity33 telescope ( pictured ) in the @entity160 could rank with the greatest discoveries about the universe over the last 25 years for their research , astronomers scanned about two per cent of the sky for three years with a telescope at the @entity160 , chosen for its very dry air , to aid in the observations a telescope at the south pole , called @entity33 ( @entity172 of cosmic @entity173 ) was used to search for evidence of gravitational waves			1
the instrument examines what is called the cosmic microwave background , the extremely weak radiation that pervades the universe			0
the background radiation is not precisely uniform			0
like light , the relic radiation is polarised as the result of interacting with electrons and atoms in space			0
computer models predicted a curl pattern in the radiation that would match what would be expected with the universe 's inflation			0
it did this by detecting a subtle property of the cosmic microwave background radiation			0
this is radiation that was created in the @entity9 and originally discovered in 1964			0
@entity33 measured the large - scale polarisation of this microwave radiation			2
only primordial gravitational waves can imprint such a pattern , and only if they have been amplified by inflation			1
for their research , astronomers scanned about two per cent of the sky for three years with a telescope at the @entity160 , chosen for its very dry air , to aid in the observations			0
these observations have eluded scientists for decades because it ’s difficult to separate the characteristic swirl of light created by gravitational waves , and the dust generated today by the @entity218			1
the @entity22 team hoped to overcome this by looking at cleanest part of the sky , over @entity223 , according to a @entity225 report by @entity226			1
but they failed to use the dust data compiled by @entity230 's @entity64 satellite , which had mapped the sky at many more frequencies than other satellites			1
the @entity64 team claims there is dust polarisation across areas of sky @entity71 took a look at			1
' it 's possible , but the error in our measurement is quite high , ' @entity64 scientist dr @entity240 told @entity245			0
' the conclusion really is that we need to analyse the data together - @entity71 and @entity64 - to get the right cosmological [ versus ] galactic signal			2
it 's really too early to say			0
' @entity251 , or @entity251 for short , is a faint glow of light that fills the universe			2
pictured is the microwave radiation from the whole sky , captured by the @entity258 's @entity64 satellite this image shows temperature fluctuations , indicated by variations in colour , of the cosmic microwave background ( @entity251 )			1
researchers say since the @entity251 is a form of light , it exhibits all the properties of light , including polarisation ( shown by black lines )			0
the changes in polarisation are thought to be caused by gravitational waves			2

using the @entity33 telescope , scientists looked at *specific* patterns in light waves within the faint microwave glow left from the @entity9
they found pattern which they believe was caused by gravitational waves
but now @entity258 scientists say cosmic dust may have caused the patterns
they claim the @entity22 team failed to use dust data compiled by @entity64 satellite , which had mapped the sky at many more frequencies
