by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 insists he has no problem putting the hard yards in to make sure he is fully fit for his first season as a @entity7 player			1
in a frank interview following @entity7 's penalty shootout win over @entity10 , @entity2 conceded manager @entity11 had every right to criticise him over his lack of fitness			1
and the 19 - year - old admitted he underestimated just how challenging it would be to make the step up from @entity18 to @entity7			1
the @entity31 was clearly not too happy with @entity2 given that he had only just sanctioned the teenager 's expensive transfer from the south coast			2
@entity2 has no qualms with his manager 's public criticism of him			2
' obviously i have seen that , and it 's something i totally agree with , ' @entity2 said when asked about @entity24 's press conference comments			2
' to play in this formation you have to be really fit			0
i am fit but i am not at the high level he demands			0
' i have got to get fitter to get up and down ( the wing )			0
it 's something i have got to work on			0
' @entity2 became the fourth most expensive defender in history when he swapped @entity18 for @entity7 in a deal that could cost the @entity51 club Â£ 28million			1
although he played for @entity53 at the @entity54 , it is worth remembering @entity2 only made his full @entity56 debut in november 2012			1
international duty : @entity2 played for @entity53 against @entity58 at the @entity59 in @entity60 @entity2 admits he miscalculated just how physically demanding it would be to step up and become @entity7 's first - choice left wing - back as part of @entity24 's new 3 - 5 - 2 system			1
' it was a surprise			0
i did n't come into @entity7 thinking it would be much harder , ' @entity2 said			1
' that 's something that i think i made a mistake on			0
' i thought it was just going to be the same but it 's the biggest club in the world and there are world - class players in training			0
' that is something that is going to push me on and it 's something i am looking forward to doing			0
' to show just how much work he thinks @entity2 needs to do , @entity24 made the full - back partake in a gruelling fitness session on the morning of the win against @entity10 , which came on penalties after a 0 - 0 draw			1
the @entity53 defender only made it onto the pitch when @entity88 pulled out of the match with an injury			2
@entity2 thinks the extra training sessions are already paying dividends			2
running man : @entity2 goes on a run during @entity7 's pre-season penalty shootout win against @entity10 ' i want and need the staff to push me on so they can do what they want			1
it will only help me in the long run , ' said @entity2 , who impressed as a second - half substitute at the @entity104 in @entity105			1
' i was n't meant to play ( against @entity10 ) so i trained on tuesday morning			2
' me and the staff decided it would be better to push me in a harder training session			0
' but i came on and played 45 minutes			1
i could have played another 45 so that 's something that shows there is a progression there after the last game			0
' the focus is now to get fitter and fitter and to be flying by the start of the season			0
' @entity2 and his @entity7 team - mates will fly to @entity118 on thursday ahead of their clash against @entity121 , which is expected to take place in front of a crowd of over 100,000 people			1
a win for @entity7 , who beat @entity128 in their first match , will see them qualify for the final of the @entity132 , which takes place on august 4 in @entity134 .			0

@entity11 believes @entity7 @entity2 needs to work on fitness
