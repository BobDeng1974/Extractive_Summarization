by @entity0 published : 10:59 est , 29 january 2014 updated : 11:34 est , 29 january 2014 it seems they do n't call it retail therapy for nothing : shopping really does make us happy			0
so , ladies , you never have to feel guilty about hitting the shopping centre again because new research claims that it can reduce our sadness			1
the piece of research , called @entity15 : making @entity16 , which features in the @entity17 , claims that shopping helps us exert control and therefore reduces feelings of sadness			1
retail therapy ... literally : a new study has found that shopping can actually boost our mood and reduce sadness ' sadness is strongly associated with a sense that situational forces control the outcomes in one 's life			1
thus shopping , by restoring control over one 's situation , can reduce sadness , ' the researchers explain			1
the study showed two groups : ' browsers ' - window shoppers - and ' choosers ' , twelve different items			0
the study found that 79 percent of the choosers felt that they were more in control while choosing , while just 2 percent of the browsers felt that way			2
researchers also found that the choosers were three times less sad than the browsers			0
the perfect excuse to hit the shops ? researchers claim that sadness is strongly associated with a sense that situational forces control the outcomes in one 's life			2
thus shopping , by restoring control over one 's situation , can reduce sadness according to @entity63 , this is backed up by a 2011 paper that claimed shopping helps boost our mood and that ' the consumption of self - treats can be strategically motivated			1
' while treating ourselves to something nice may improve our mood , there has also been plenty of contradictory research over the years			0
a study from the @entity75 suggests that shopping as a cure for loneliness is futile - and could in fact make us feel more lonely			0
in fact , the very act of fending off loneliness by shopping can create a vicious cycle where one shops because they are lonely , feels more lonely because they have shopped , and continues shopping in a misguided attempt to cure the loneliness .			0
