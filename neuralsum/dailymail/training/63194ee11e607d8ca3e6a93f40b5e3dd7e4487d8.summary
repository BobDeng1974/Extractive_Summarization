by @entity1 - @entity0 follow @ @ riathalsam it may all end in tears , but there is enough of @entity6 in @entity7 to suggest it is right for @entity9 to give youth a chance at this year ’s @entity12			1
that is the view of @entity14 , who thinks the touch and confidence to try the audacious has seemingly passed from the man who lit up @entity18 to a 20 - year - old who is one of @entity9 ’s brightest hopes heading to @entity21			1
@entity22 is convinced the youthful combination of @entity7 , @entity24 and particularly @entity25 represents @entity9 ’s best hope of surviving @entity27 similarities : @entity14 can see a little bit of @entity30 in @entity9 frontman @entity7 ( pictured ) gifted : @entity32 's audacious skills and talent lit up @entity18 when @entity9 reached the @entity12 semi-finals have a word with him : @entity14 was on hand after a tearful @entity32 had been booked a would be suspended should @entity9 get to the @entity12 final in 1990 could all end in tears : @entity14 's signal to @entity9 boss @entity40 to speak with @entity32 is an iconic moment in @entity9 's @entity12 history the striker who scored 48 goals for his country said : ‘ i think a good percentage of them will start			1
i think he ( @entity49 ) knows that ’s his best chance , rather than trying the ones that have been there , seen that , done it			0
‘ i see things in @entity7 ’s game , in terms of strengths and weaknesses			2
like @entity32 he can go past people			2
he ’s got a similar stature , got amazing ability and will score amazing goals like @entity32			1
‘ on the defensive side he ’s slightly lacking in terms of tactical nous , but if you play him in a certain position that would n’t necessarily be that important			0
i ’m not going to say @entity7 ’s the next @entity32 , but i think there are two or three ( who could take a @entity12 by storm like @entity32 )			1
’ while @entity7 has excelled from central positions , it is @entity25 , magnificently effective across @entity75 ’s attack , who has most grabbed @entity14 ’s attention			1
@entity79 duo : @entity7 has performed well for @entity80 while @entity25 has impressed at @entity75 ( left ) the 19 - year - old has won only two caps - only @entity83 of the 20 outfield players in the squad has fewer - but his versatility and form excite @entity22			1
‘ @entity25 is a phenomenal talent , ’ he said			0
‘ he ’s probably the best of the youngsters			0
he looks slightly ahead of @entity7 in terms of consistency , and his ability to play in a number of positions is incredible for one so inexperienced			2
‘ @entity24 is a beautiful footballer			0
he lacks a bit of pace but he is wonderfully gifted with both feet and he keeps the ball well			0
@entity99 could also comfortably emerge and become a star			0
’ only six of the squad have experienced a @entity12 , but @entity14 , who believes reaching the quarter - finals ‘ would be a pretty good effort ’ , said : ‘ we ’ve got exciting young players not stained by previous tournaments			2
’ wonderfully gifted : @entity14 described @entity107 midfielder @entity24 as a beautiful footballer			0

@entity14 can see a little bit of @entity6 in @entity7
@entity80 frontman has similar confidence and talent to @entity32 , according to @entity116 host
@entity14 and @entity6 famously starred for @entity9 together at @entity18
