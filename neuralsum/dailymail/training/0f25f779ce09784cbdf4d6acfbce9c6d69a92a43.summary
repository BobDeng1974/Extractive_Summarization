i became suspicious when i found out that the person who was targeting the family member claimed to be a soldier			1
‘ his story simply did n’t ring true			0
for example he said he was sent to @entity17 straight from @entity18 – and i know that does n’t happen			0
so we decided to bring in a private investigation company			2
that firm was called @entity40			0
’ he went on : ‘ they made some preliminary investigations and then reported to us advising that we needed to urgently contact the police and that is exactly what we did			0
the family member received some guidance about handling communications with the weirdo			2
but the matter was resolved very quickly by the police and i am very grateful to them			0
’ mr @entity1 added : ‘ i do not know how the private investigators discovered the identity of the @entity110 i certainly was n’t aware of any alleged unlawful conduct			2
@entity77 did find an address and a telephone number but i do n’t know how this was done			0
they simply reported back to us to advise calling in the police			0
as with any family , we are all just grateful that this shocking thing is over			0
