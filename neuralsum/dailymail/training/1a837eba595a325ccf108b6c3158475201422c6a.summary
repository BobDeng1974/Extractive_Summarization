by @entity0 , @entity1 sir @entity2 is certain @entity3 will finish above their bitter rivals @entity4 next year			1
@entity4 's 4 - 0 win over @entity6 means they need just one point from their final game of the season to win the @entity10			2
united , meanwhile , are 20 points behind their neighbours in seventh place			0

on the rise : sir @entity2 believes @entity3 will finish above rivals @entity4 next season but the club 's all - time top goal scorer , who is now a director at @entity25 , has told @entity4 the balance of power will swing back in @entity3 's favour next year			1

we have the most fantastic organisation and that organisation when it works is unstoppable			0
' @entity51 's appointment will not be confirmed until after @entity53 ' final game of his interim spell as player - manager on sunday at @entity56			1

' when the season ends i will go away and think about what i want to do next			0
' i said five or six years ago that if my career ended tomorrow i would be happy so every year is a bonus			0
' i still enjoy training and playing but i have really enjoyed the last couple of weeks so it has been a good experience to take me on to the next chapter of my life			0
' pride of @entity39 : @entity88 and @entity4 stand on the brink of winning the title just like @entity91 , @entity53 is sure @entity3 will perform much better next season			1
