@entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 may rule @entity3 , but cast your eyes away from the glitz , glamour and silverware and head north to the @entity10			1
there 's a new @entity13 fairytale in @entity14			2
on sunday , the minnows will play their first ever @entity13 top flight game against @entity17 in front of a few thousand fans at their @entity21 home			1
with this , they become the smallest ever team to play in the top division			0
with a capacity of 5,250 - less than 18 of the current @entity28 grounds - it will be a cramped , rowdy but overall celebratory affair			0
that 's because @entity31 's place in @entity3 was nearly taken away from them			1
historic moment : @entity13 minnows @entity14 will play in @entity3 for the first - time ever in their history winning smiles : @entity14 players celebrate gaining promotion in may from @entity38 @entity39 's best : @entity31 will face the talents of @entity41 ( left ) and @entity42 ( right ) next season aptly nicknamed ' the @entity44 ' , @entity31 bear some resemblance to their @entity46 namesakes @entity48			1
they are well run , self - sustainable and put on a fantastic show for supporters			0
but after gaining promotion in may by finishing two points ahead of @entity54 , @entity31 were immediately threatened with a double relegation to @entity56 , @entity13 ’s third tier			1
the @entity13 @entity58 demanded @entity31 should raise over 1.7million euros by august 6 , because the club were required to hold a share capital of at least 2.1million euros			1
controversial : despite gaining promotion to @entity3 , @entity31 were threatened with a double relegation ridiculous : the @entity13 fa demanded @entity31 should raise over 1.7million euros by august 6 to play in @entity3 the demands of the @entity13 @entity58 were strict ; seen by some as a way of keeping little old @entity31 down in the lower leagues			1
that may be a conspiracy theory , but fans were right to point to the debt hanging over bigger teams in @entity3			0
they asked how could a club with absolutely no debt be denied entry to the top flight and threatened with a double relegation ? a campaign , @entity31 – defend @entity31 – was created by the club and supported by former loan players @entity79 and @entity80 , who echoed these concerns			1
standing strong : @entity31 's campaign to keep them in @entity3 worked with the club raising the required funds @entity80 said in may : ‘ it is contradictory that a club who has an enviable financial health and with zero debts is obliged to do this , when there are others who have much deeper problems			1
‘ i hope we can put in a big push to keep when where they deserve to be			0
’ chairman @entity98 was also perplexed by the ruling , with this example warranting a deeper look at the financial requirements policy for newly - promoted clubs			0
up for it : former @entity14 player @entity80 has supported the club 's efforts to play in @entity3 this season blast from the past : @entity13 international @entity79 ( left ) also featured for @entity31 in a loan spell from @entity109 he told @entity110 at the time : ' even though we have a small budget , we have a different economic model to other clubs in @entity13			1
we have less expenses , fewer outgoings and we always have a small deficit			0
' this is something really strange in @entity13 because almost every team has huge debt , but in our case we have no debt			0
' we think it is really unfair because the law was established to assure that all those clubs with a lot of debt had a minimum capital value to attend to all their debts			0
' the campaign worked , and by selling shares for a minimum of 50 euros and maximum of 100,000 euros , the club raised the cash by mid-july ; a stiff two fingers up to the @entity13 fa			2
over 8,000 people from 48 countries now own part of the club , from @entity142 football fans to @entity143 and @entity144 with a new team to look out for			1
worldwide support : over 8,000 people from 48 countries now own part of the @entity13 minnows close ties : @entity31 's blue and red strip originated from @entity0 's kit @entity80 , from @entity17 in 2001 , and @entity79 , from @entity109 in 2005 were sent to @entity31 to ' toughen them up ' , and the club 's philosophy remains strong			1
nevermind @entity155 on a wet , tuesday night			0
@entity156 will be given a stern , honest test from @entity159 ’s men in march , and @entity0 will at least be able to relate to the newcomers on one level			0
@entity31 's blue and red strip originated from a @entity0 kit , handed to them four years after they were founded in 1940 because they were short			1
those who handed the strips to @entity31 would struggle to believe that 70 years later the two would clash in the top flight			2
the two sides are still polar opposites in wealth and stature			0
in fact , @entity31 are miles from any @entity3 side in size			2
petit : @entity179 's @entity178 currently holds a capacity of 5,250 the tiny @entity10 city , with a population of 27,000 , would fit into the @entity184 nearly four times ; the city of @entity2 119 times			1
the only city in @entity13 with a @entity3 team that comes close to the size of @entity31 is @entity189 , with nearly double the number of habitants			2
the total number of fans that watched @entity31 in the @entity38 last season – 63,000 – would fit in @entity195 with plenty of empty seats for the tv cameras to scan over			2
this gives you some idea of the task chairman @entity98 and manager @entity159 face throughout the 38 - game season , but @entity31 have recruited midfielder @entity205 in the last week to strengthen a side depleted by returning loan players			2
all smiles : @entity31 have signed @entity205 ( centre ) to help them strengthen their @entity3 debut campaign @entity212 , who clocked up 11 goals last season from midfield , signed a three - year deal with @entity216 this summer from parent club @entity217 , but striker @entity218 has arrived from @entity219			1
other than @entity205 and @entity218 , the team is currently completely @entity13			0
the next challenge is for the club to upgrade their stadium			0
under @entity3 rules , clubs have to increase their capacity to 15,000 in two years , and for now @entity31 are building a new stand to increase the @entity178 to 6,700			2
they would welcome being forced into making another upgrade next summer ; it would mean they have survived in @entity3			0
our first @entity233 £ 1,000 weekly winner is revealed ( he 's an @entity235 fan who got lucky with two @entity237 defenders ) ... and here 's his team			0

@entity14 are *gearing* up for their first - ever season in @entity3
@entity13 minnows won promotion from @entity38 last season
@entity13 @entity58 threatened the club with double relegation after demanding the club had to raise 1.7million euros to play in the top flight
@entity80 and @entity79 , two former players , helped support the campaign to see the club in @entity3
over 8,000 people from 48 countries now own part of the @entity10 minnows
@entity260 's @entity178 holds a capacity of 5,250
kit colours of red and blue stripes originated from @entity0 's strip
@entity31 's nickname is ' the @entity44 ' and town 's population is 27,000
