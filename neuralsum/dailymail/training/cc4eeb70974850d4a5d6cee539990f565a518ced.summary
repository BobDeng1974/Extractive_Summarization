by @entity0 they 're one of the most fearsome breeds of dog on the planet , infamous for their aggressive behaviour and jaws that can shake the life out of an opponent			1
but for 30 - year - old glamour model @entity10 from @entity11 in @entity12 , the pit bull is nothing more than a cuddly pet and she has not one but three of them			1
' i have them because i love them , ' she explains			0
' i really do , i 'm just obsessed with them			0
they 're just the best kind of dog i 've ever come across			2
' safe : @entity10 , pictured with her pet @entity25 , says pit bulls are unfairly maligned and are wonderful dogs but pit bull terriers , like the @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 , are one of four dog breeds that @entity35 citizens can not have in their homes without falling foul of the law			1
those who do own one face a £ 5,000 fine , a six - month prison sentence and the prospect of having their pet taken away and destroyed			1
@entity10 , however , thinks that the law is unfair			1
' you see @entity46 , ' she says , gesturing at one of her three pit bulls			2
' she was bred for fighting but she would n't hurt a fly			0
she 's been around my son for two years , around his mates for two years and all she wants is love and attention			0
' that 's not an aggressive dog , is it ? it 's not her fault that some stupid idiot bloody bred her and trained her to be aggressive like that to other dogs			1
it 's not the dog 's fault , it 's the owner			0
' fighting : unfortunately for @entity10 , her dogs @entity46 and @entity25 sometimes fight - viciously - with each other cleaning up : @entity10 kisses her dog @entity46 better after she got into a bloody scrap during a visit to the park under the 1991 @entity75 , it is illegal to own pit bulls , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			1
owners can expect punishments including six months in prison and a six - month fine , while the police have the power to confiscate and destroy these breeds			1
however , owners can apply to have the dogs legalised , although this involves a lengthy observation period away from home			1
dogs that are declared safe must be neutered , muzzled in public and can never be let off the lead outside of the home			2
not all pit bull types are banned , however			1
@entity97 bull terriers , a harmless breed known for their gentleness with children , look similar but have totally different personalities			2
sadly , their resemblance to the infamous pit bull means they are often abandoned with more staffies taken in by sanctuaries than any other breed			1
nevertheless , she 's the first to admit that owning pit bulls is n't all plain sailing , not least because of their tendency to attack other dogs - and each other			1
' it 's not the dog 's fault , it 's the f * * * ing idiots who train them to fight like that and be so aggressive , ' she fumes			2
' i hate it when they start fighting , hate it			0
but just because they do n't like a certain dog , it does n't mean they 're like it all the time			2
' but while @entity10 has no intention of allowing her pets near a dog fighting ring or teaching them to behave in a vicious fashion , other owners are n't so responsible			1
speaking on @entity142 documentary , @entity143 and @entity144 , mother - of - one @entity139 , 43 , from @entity140 , said she would n't mind if her animal ' ripped someone 's face off '			2
she continued : ' i do n't want her to be a soft dog			0
i want her to be really , really vicious			0
' i 've got a 10 - year - old little boy in the house and if anybody takes his stuff , i do n't care who they are - she can rip off their faces			0
' if she 's going to protect my house and bite somebody , that 's what i 've taught her to do			0
' dangerous dogs have become an increasingly common problem in the @entity35 , with an estimated 40 people killed by out - of - control hounds in the last decade alone			1
banned : owning a pit bull in the @entity35 can result in a six month prison sentence and a £ 5,000 fine maligned : staffies are often confused with pit bulls and although gentle , are regularly abandoned by owners nevertheless , @entity139 , who owns two @entity97 bull terriers - a breed that is n't usually vicious and is known to be very good with children - says she feels so unsafe at home , she 's happy to risk having a dangerous dog			1
' we live on a horrible street and round the corner , we get a lot of people who do break - ins a lot , ' she adds			0
' it 's very rough round here now and we 've got a lot of druggies			0
if you left 20p on the side in your house , they 'd take it			0
that 's why you 've got to have dogs like this			0
' for @entity10 , her pit bulls are pets and in a bid to keep them safe , she has gone to court to have them legalised - a status currently held by an estimated 2,600 @entity35 pit bulls			1
although legalising a dog means police inspections , a muzzle when in public and castration to ensure the dogs do n't reproduce , @entity10 says she is happy to go ahead			1
struggle : @entity139 , who wants her dogs to be vicious , is having a tough time training her staffie not to be soft play : although @entity212 is happy to attack bottles , she appears reluctant to do the same to people ' i think if pit bulls have to wear a muzzle then every other dog should wear one , ' she complains			1
' any dog can bite another dog so i do n't really agree with the muzzle side but i 'm definitely sticking to the rules			0
' i went through all that trouble just to get them legalised and i would n't risk my dogs ' lives			0
if everyone was a responsible owner , there would be no dog fights in public , there would be no dogs getting savaged , there 'd be no kids getting savaged or anything like that			0
' she adds : ' they 're my family and that is it			0
they 're not a status symbol , they 're not a weapon , they 're not for breeding - they 're just family and that is it			2
' @entity10 and @entity139 appear on @entity143 and @entity144 , tonight at 9 on @entity142			2

@entity10 , 30 , a glamour model from @entity11 , owns three pit bull dogs
says that despite fearsome *reputation* , they 're wonderful animals
owning a pit bull is illegal and can be punished with six months in prison
ms @entity10 blames *irresponsible* owners for out - of - control dogs
some owners *deliberately* train their dogs to be vicious and aggressive
