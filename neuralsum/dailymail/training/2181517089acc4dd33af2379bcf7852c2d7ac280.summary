he said : ' she ( @entity58 ) says he was in a fight that day but she does not know who with			0
' ' it has to be said that some of what i ’ve heard does seem very odd and indeed very suspicious			2
but i have to recognise that much of what has been said , in court terms , is mere speculation			0
there ’s an absence of direct evidence to support it ' - coroner @entity32 @entity2 ’s wife @entity86 , 59 , said she was aware of the affair with @entity63 but stuck by her husband , with whom she had two teenage sons aged 18 and 19 years , and had let him know it would not affect their family life			1

' at the time , i did n’t take note of anything			0
' the goldmine in @entity6 which mr @entity2 ran on behalf of two @entity29 city investors a post-mortem examination in @entity6 gave the cause of death as asphyxia due to hanging and a pathologist recorded it as a suicide			1
mr @entity2 ’s body was flown back to the @entity29 for another post-mortem examination , which also gave the cause of death as asphyxia due to hanging			2
detective sergeant @entity215 , of @entity8 police , explained their inquiry had been hampered by a lack of cooperation from the @entity6 authorities			1
giving evidence , he said : ' we have made diplomatic attempts and requests for information through the right channels			0
in this case , nothing has been forthcoming			0
' he was a strong and wonderful husband and a loving father and an extremely positive person			0
we hope it will not be too much longer before we can get some answers about how he died ' - @entity182 ' there appears to be suspicion of foul play by the family but there is no tangible evidence we ’ve been able to ascertain to support that			1
' recording an open verdict , coroner @entity32 said : ' it has to be said that some of what i ’ve heard does seem very odd and indeed very suspicious			1
' but i have to recognise that much of what has been said , in court terms , is mere speculation			0
there ’s an absence of direct evidence to support it			0
' in all of the circumstances , there is insufficient evidence for me to determine properly how @entity68 came by his death and i therefore record an open verdict			1
' speaking after the inquest yesterday , @entity182 said : ' he was a strong and wonderful husband and a loving father and an extremely positive person			0
' we hope it will not be too much longer before we can get some answers about how he died			0

he was so strong , so resourceful , and so positive that in his memory i ’ve been putting that in to practice to get through this			0
' @entity59 , of @entity272 , @entity273 , said : ' we are happy with an open verdict			2
we hope publicity about this case will lead to answers and we are putting out a $ 25,000 dollars reward for information			0
