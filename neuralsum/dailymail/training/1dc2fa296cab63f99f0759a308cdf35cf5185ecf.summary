former @entity1 @entity0 , who revealed this week that he had delivered the two fatal shots to @entity3 , gave a motivational speech on thursday evening - but did not mention the famous raid			1
@entity0 , 38 , appeared on stage in @entity7 before a rapt audience where he told stories about combat in @entity12 but did not mention shooting dead the @entity14 leader			1
@entity15 revealed on thursday that @entity16 , a retired 16 - year veteran of the elite squad , is the man who says he shot the @entity14 leader in the head to kill him			1
the retired seal , father to a ten - year - old daughter , skipped over the controversy surrounding his revelation last night and instead spoke to the audience about what he called the most ' painful ' thing about being in the military			1
' it 's not getting shot at , or things blowing up next to you , ' @entity0 said			1
' it 's kissing your kid goodbye for what could be the very last time and you 're both aware of it			1
@entity0 publicly identified himself on thursday as the man who shot @entity3 in the head although he did not mention the @entity3 raid from 2011 , he alluded to the mission @entity57 reported , joking at the start of his speech : ' so i 've been busy preparing this speech today			1
i 've had my phone and computer off			0
anything interesting on the internet ? ' the veteran received a standing ovation from the packed audience in @entity40 on thursday night and if they were disappointed to miss out on details of the 9/11 mastermind 's death they gave no sign of it as they left the auditorium			2
' he was just amazing			0
i appreciate mr @entity0 's service to our country , ' one man said			1
others called @entity0 ' inspirational '			2
but @entity0 going public as the @entity84 member who killed @entity86 's public enemy number one has sparked a whispering campaign from other seals claiming that his account of the killing is not truthful			1
his identity had been a closely - guarded secret but @entity0 is due to reveal his account in an interview with @entity95 next week			1
@entity0 said more and more people were becoming aware of his role and that his name was bound to become public anyway			2
today it became clear that other seals are about to accuse him of lying - although there is agreement that he was on the raid			0
@entity84 member @entity16 was revealed by @entity15 to be the serviceman who is to be interviewed by @entity95 next week , going public on his role in the raid which killed @entity3 a seal source told @entity15 : ' the real shooter would never discuss it publicly			1
' members of @entity84 have n’t discussed it publicly so there ’s a reasonable chance he ’s not being truthful			2
' there is no way @entity114 could really prove it was he who took the fatal shot on @entity3 unless his comrades all attested to it			2
' but again , the code of secrecy with these special operators would preclude that			0
' a second source told @entity15 that other seals were expected to speak out anonymously against @entity0			1
although some special operations service members and veterans are unhappy that one of their own has taken credit publicly for killing @entity3 , others said they have gotten used to the idea that their brethren might break the code of silence and seek to profit from their deeds			1
that internal debate gained intensity this week after retired @entity1 seal @entity0 acknowledged that he had fired two rounds into the forehead of the @entity14 leader during the 2011 raid on his secret compound in @entity143			1
@entity0 had recounted his version of the @entity3 raid in february 2013 to @entity146 , which identified him only as ' the shooter			1
' in a story on thursday , the @entity148 identified him by name as he described shooting the leader of the terrorist group behind the attacks of september 11 , 2001			0
one current and one former seal confirmed that @entity0 was long known to have killed @entity3			1
@entity157 officials confirmed that @entity0 was a member of @entity84 and was part of the raid but they said they could not confirm who fired the fatal shot , noting that other seals on the mission also fired at @entity3			1
if @entity0 discloses classified information during the interviews he could be subject to an investigation or action by the @entity167 , the @entity157 officials said			2
@entity0 told the @entity148 that shots also were fired by two other seal team members , including @entity170 , who described the raid somewhat differently in his book ' no @entity173			2
' the fatigue shirt worn by @entity1 @entity0 during the mission to capture @entity3 , in a case at the september 11 museum in @entity178 his lawyer said @entity180 is under federal criminal investigation over whether he disclosed classified information in the book , which he did not vet with the military			1
in the @entity146 piece , @entity0 makes no mention of @entity180 shooting @entity3			1
well before the @entity148 interview , @entity0 discussed his role in the raid during a private meeting with relatives of victims of the 9/11 attack on @entity178 's @entity196 before the recent opening of the @entity199 september 11 @entity198			2
he donated the shirt he was wearing in the operation , which is now on display there			0
@entity0 is scheduled to be featured in lengthy segments next week on @entity95			2
he told the @entity148 he decided to go public because he feared his identity was going to be leaked by others			0
indeed , his name appeared on monday on the website @entity208 , which is operated by former special operations troops			0
the actions of both @entity0 and @entity180 have drawn scorn from some of their colleagues			2
in an october 31 open letter , rear adm. @entity215 , who commands the @entity216 , and force master chief @entity217 , the top noncommissioned officer of the group , urged @entity1 to lower their public profile			2
their comments were widely perceived as being aimed at @entity0 and @entity180			0
' at @entity216 's core is the @entity1 ethos , ' the letter says			2
' a critical tenant of our ethos is '' i do not advertise the nature of my work , nor seek recognition for my actions			0
'' ' the letter added : ' we do not abide willful or selfish disregard for our core values in return for public notoriety or financial gain			0
' @entity238 , whose brother @entity239 was the pilot of the hijacked plane that crashed into the @entity241 , attended the 9/11 museum ceremony			0
she said @entity0 , whose name was not divulged at the event , offered the families clarity on conflicting information they had received about the raid			0
she said she did n't have an opinion about whether @entity1 should disclose information about their deeds			0
' whatever that ( @entity1 ' ) ethos is , is between the seals , ' she said			0
' the 9/11 families are the beneficiaries of any rules he might have broken or whatever lines he might have crossed			0
' ' he went through the mission in really in great detail			0
all that information was very helpful to me because this is a figure in a terror organization that has loomed large in our lives , ' she said , adding that she listened to him so intently that the 9/11 commemorative coin she was clasping tightly in her hand left a bruise			0
@entity273 , a former seal team commander who previously urged his comrades to avoid discussing recent operations , said active - duty @entity1 are ' pretty much very disappointed and i 'd have to say angry with guys who have used their deeds and those of their companions for personal gain			1
' a framed @entity283 newspaper article on @entity0 , signed by @entity0 , is seen on the wall of the @entity285 in @entity51 ' @entity170 ' was published in 2012 under the pseudonym @entity287			0
@entity180 recounted on @entity288 's 60 minutes that he sent a text to the commander of @entity84 after its publication			0
he said the commander replied : ' delete me			0
' at the same time , @entity273 said , there is frustration among some special operations soldiers that senior government officials have left office and written memoirs revealing and profiting from actions involving troops who are sworn to secrecy			0
however , one active - duty @entity1 officer , who declined to be quoted by name because he had no permission to speak publicly , said some @entity1 had grown accustomed to some of their members seeking to profit from their connections to the elite group , upon retirement			1
senior @entity241 and @entity313 officials cooperated extensively with the makers of @entity315 , a film that depicted both the @entity313 's years - long hunt for @entity3 and the @entity1 raid that killed him in @entity143			1
in the @entity146 piece , @entity0 said he was one of two seals who went up to the third floor of the building where @entity3 was hiding			1
the first man fired two shots at @entity3 as he peeked out of the bedroom , but @entity0 says those shots missed			1
the man then tackled two women in the hallway outside of @entity3 's bedroom			1
@entity0 went into the bedroom , he recounts			0
' there was @entity3 standing there			0
he had his hands on a woman 's shoulders , pushing her ahead , not exactly toward me but by me , in the direction of the hallway commotion			0
it was his youngest wife , @entity339			0
' @entity0 added : ' in that second , i shot him two times in the forehead			2
bap ! bap ! the second time as he 's going down			0
he crumpled onto the floor in front of his bed and i hit him again			0
' @entity14 leader @entity3 in @entity12			1
@entity0 , a retired @entity1 who says he fatally shot @entity3 in the head , publicly identified himself on thursday ,			1

@entity15 revealed that @entity0 is ' @entity352 ' and the man who will be interviewed next week publicly discussing the death of @entity3
the retired seal appeared on stage before a rapt audience where he talked about combat in @entity12 - but did not mention @entity3 's killing
he said the most painful thing about fighting overseas was ' kissing your kid goodbye for what could be the last time and you 're both aware of it '
his account says that he rushed into @entity3 's room at his @entity143 compound in 2011 and shot him in the head , killing him dead
@entity1 source : ' the real shooter would never discuss it publicly ... there 's a reasonable possibility he 's not telling the truth '
sources expected to claim he was not the first to the @entity14 overlord 's room
