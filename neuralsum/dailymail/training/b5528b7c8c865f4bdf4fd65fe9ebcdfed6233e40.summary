by @entity0 , @entity1 editor published : 18:06 est , 28 may 2012 updated : 02:40 est , 29 may 2012 open wide : dentists have been accused of duping patients into paying for treatment they could have for free on the @entity6 unscrupulous dentists face a crackdown amid evidence that patients are being duped into paying for private treatments which should be free on the @entity6			1
the @entity12 is today demanding an urgent and radical shake - up in the £ 5.73billion @entity15 market as @entity15 are being ' deliberately misled ' into spending up to four times more for fillings and crowns			1
as many as 500,000 people a year are being duped into paying for expensive private treatments that should be free under the @entity6 , the @entity12 said			1
research suggest fees in this country are among the highest in @entity23 , with a bill for a check - up running to as much as £ 124			1
many people struggle to find an @entity6 dentist at all while others are letting their teeth go to ruin because they can not afford the work			1
the @entity12 ’s findings are a damning verdict on new contracts for dental services which were introduced by the @entity36 government in 2006			1
importantly , the watchdog said any qualified dentist should be allowed to offer @entity6 treatment , rather than the current closed shop where a group of contracted dentists provide services based on annual quotas			1
this would allow individuals to choose their dentist from a wide field , so increasing competition			1
the @entity12 also argues people should be able to make direct bookings with hygienists , rather than having to go through a dentist			1
this would allow @entity56 chains such as @entity57 and @entity58 to offer cheap ‘ walk - in ’ services			1
the watchdog is also concerned about the hard sell of expensive monthly dental plans by some practices which can be poor value			1
chief executive @entity66 said : ‘ our study has raised significant concerns			1
‘ all too often patients lack access to the information they need , for example when choosing a dentist or when getting dental treatment			2
‘ we also unearthed evidence that some patients may be receiving deliberately inaccurate information about their entitlement to @entity6 dental treatment , and we expect to see robust action taken			2
’ some 39 per cent of people who had been to the dentist in the past two years reported there were no leaflets or posters providing information on @entity6 charges			2
more than eight in ten people who recently received a course of dental treatment did not receive a written plan spelling out what was to be done and the cost			2
the @entity12 said : ‘ we are particularly concerned to find that around 500,000 patients each year may be provided with inaccurate information by their dentist regarding their entitlement to receive particular dental treatments on the @entity6 , and as a result be required to pay more to receive private dental treatment			2
’ the @entity12 is also highly critical of the @entity6 and industry bodies for doing too little to weed out rogue dentists who mislead patients , are incompetent or overcharge			2
patients ’ @entity106 chief executive @entity105 said : ‘ patients frequently tell us that they are not being given the information they need to make informed choices about their dentistry treatment			0
they feel they are paying for treatment that may not have been necessary			0
‘ dentists have been able to get away with unacceptable practice			0
’ the @entity106 insisted most patients were ‘ happy ’			0
executive board director dr @entity116 said : ‘ the delivery of effective dental care is all about good communication between dentists and patients			0
that communication will not be enhanced by the @entity12 ’s headline - grabbing approach to publicising this report			0
’ @entity36 ’s controversial contracts resulted in thousands of dentists quitting the @entity6 , leaving many communities without a dentist			0
they were blamed for an estimated one million people losing access to an @entity6 dentist between 2006 and 2008			0
the @entity132 last year launched pilots of a new dental contract , focused on improving children ’s oral health			0
dentists will be paid for the number of patients they care for and the health results , rather than the number of courses of treatment performed			0
health minister @entity145 said : ‘ denying patients care on the basis of misinformation is a very serious matter			0
any dentist that does this risks breaching their contract and we would expect the local @entity6 to take action			0

fees in @entity15 are among the highest in @entity23
many let teeth *rot* because they can not afford the work
