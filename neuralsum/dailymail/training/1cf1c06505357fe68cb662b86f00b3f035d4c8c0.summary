by @entity0 published : 10:25 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 12:44 est , 11 september 2013 many cat owners would proudly boast that their pet is house - trained			1
but @entity4 has gone one step further - and learned to spend a penny on the toilet			1
the tortoiseshell pet was taken in as a stray by @entity10 , 30 , and became so attached she followed him everywhere - even the loo			1
and to his amazement @entity4 started leaping up onto the open toilet bowl and carefully peeing over the edge into the water			1
scroll down to video @entity4 followed her owners everywhere and picked up a few human traits on the way including using the toilet mr @entity10 said : ' i think she just sort of picked it up while we were doing it			1
' she would always follow us into the bathroom , there was nothing we could do to get her out , she would just sit on the bath as we did our thing			0
@entity4 and her owners , @entity32 , 32 , ( left ) and @entity10 , 30 , ( right ) who were amazed to discover her using the toilet ' then one day i heard this noise coming from the bathroom and when we went to investigate she was just using the toilet			1
' she ’s been doing for four or five months now , she wo n’t go anywhere else , she walks in , does her thing and then leaves			0
' we did n’t teach her , although i wish we could teach her to flush the toilet afterwards ! ' it is reminiscent of the big - screen comedy @entity42 starring @entity43 , in which the family cat , mr @entity45 , could use the lavatory - although he could flush in the film			0
@entity4 turned up on the doorstep of mr @entity10 and his partner @entity32 , 32 , in @entity51 , @entity52 , two years ago			2
the malnourished pet was micro-chipped but when the couple traced her owner they had moved away			0
@entity4 has also started picking up other human traits such as cuddling up under the duvet with her head on the pillow and sitting on a chair like her owners			2
' she ’s our baby , ' added mr @entity10 , a pr and marketing manager			0
' we would n’t have her any other way			0
' it ’s a little strange for sure , but it saves us money on cat litter ! ' when they rescued her , @entity4 was malnourished but she has been nursed back to normal weight			2

@entity4 *'s* owners were amazed to find her *tinkling* into the bowl
but the tortoiseshell pet has still not learned to flush
