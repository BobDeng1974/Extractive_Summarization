there will be calls for @entity2 to get rid of @entity3 and @entity4 on the back of their failures here but i think they should both play all three tests against @entity12 before any sort of decision is made			1
we are talking about two batsmen with phenomenal test records who have done it against @entity21 in the past and , with good players like that , you do not jettison them easily			2
@entity3 , for instance , will end up with one of the greatest of all @entity2 records and you have to give people of that calibre every possible chance to show they are worth a place			1
@entity4 ( left ) and @entity3 head out to open @entity2 's second innings against @entity12 @entity4 walks past @entity3 after he was dismissed for just four runs by @entity35 on day three i said after the first day of this test that @entity2 ’s top order was a bit one - paced which could be an issue but that does not mean i think they should be dropped unless there is conclusive evidence they are in decline			1
@entity2 ’s new opening pair have very different issues			2
@entity4 will have played all sorts of mind games with himself ahead of this game , telling himself to enjoy it and trying to forget how people perceive him after leaving @entity21			1
he will have desperately tried not to build this @entity36 up too much but , once out in the middle , he will have known how important it is			2
you could see how frenetic he was and how much he was moving at the crease			2
when you are nervous and desperate to do well your movements can become exaggerated as emotion takes hold			2
he has got to tell himself to stay still at the crease			0
the @entity4 i remember was almost @entity61 - like in how still he was			1
if it were not for his scratching around you would n’t notice him			0
the @entity4 i remember would get to 70 before you knew it and we ca n’t judge his comeback on a test where he has received good deliveries in both innings			1
@entity4 was making his first @entity36 appearance for @entity2 in 18 months against the @entity12 he has to tell himself to calm down , stay still and chill a bit at the crease and it will be hard because the @entity77 ball is swinging and he is not accustomed to being an opener			1
he has been at three his whole career			0
if he does not make runs in the next two tests and @entity2 are convinced he wo n’t be able to become the player he was then that is the time to have a look at someone else			0
the captain , in contrast , has a technical issue			0
@entity3 is mentally one of the strongest cricketers @entity2 have ever produced , an incredible fighter and an incredible bloke who has such a burning desire to prove people wrong			1
@entity4 leaves the field in @entity95 following his poor showing on day three of the first test yes , form is a concern — he has n’t scored an international century in two years but this is a man who reached 25 test hundreds in record time			1
and it is true to say he has been found out			0
@entity3 based his game around three shots — the cut , the pull and clip off the hip — and he would get lots of runs			1
now opponents are bowling at him in the areas he does n’t want them to and he has a problem when the ball is moving			0
but the swinging ball is not a new phenomenon , especially to an opener brought up in @entity2 , and @entity3 has to score runs against the moving ball now if he is going to prolong his @entity36 career			1
@entity4 was very much in the mould of @entity121 batsman @entity61 ( above ) when he was on form @entity3 has now gone 61 combined test and odi innings without making a century @entity12 will be very disciplined for an hour but their third seamer is @entity126			1
if @entity3 can just sit in , be a bit more disciplined outside off stump and see off that new ball then the run - making opportunities will come			2
bowlers will get bored before he does			0
it is not that he can not score when the ball is pitched up			0
you do n’t score 8,423 @entity36 runs without being able to play off the front foot			0
but in his first 10 or 15 minutes he is pushing too hard at the ball rather than letting it come to him			0
these are both exceptional players and you are always a better player when you are out of a side			0
it takes a long time to make a @entity36 player — do n’t discard them until you are absolutely sure the time is right .			0

@entity3 and @entity4 have both struggled with the bat
@entity4 looked nervous while his movement was erratic
@entity3 has *n't* scored an international century in two years
