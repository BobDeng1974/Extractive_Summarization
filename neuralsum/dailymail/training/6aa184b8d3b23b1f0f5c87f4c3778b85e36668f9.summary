by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 8 december 2012 updated : 17:16 est , 8 december 2012 long - jumper @entity3 ’s @entity2 triumph , on ‘ @entity5 ’ , alongside his team - mates @entity7 and @entity8 , will come to define one of the greatest years in @entity11 sporting history			1
‘ this is what i ’ve dreamt of my entire life , ’ he told the @entity12 afterwards , voice cracking , as the sound of 80,000 cheers echoed around the stadium			2
the 25 - year - old , dubbed the ‘ ginger ninja ’ , perhaps had more reason than most to feel emotional			2
@entity11 ’s first long - jump gold medallist since 1964 suffered years of agony as a result of repeated hamstring tears , which came close to ending his career			1
his recovery and remarkable return to form is thanks to a controversial treatment – first developed in the @entity34 to combat decompression sickness suffered by deep - sea divers			1
in winning condition : olympic gold medallist @entity3 is on the track thanks to the oxygen treatment called @entity40 ( @entity41 ) , the principle behind it is simple : deliver higher levels of oxygen to the body at double the normal atmospheric pressure and injuries heal faster			1
the effects can be felt within days and , as @entity3 discovered , are transformative – yet , astonishingly , while it is often offered to elite athletes , the @entity48 refuses to offer it as a treatment for everyday injuries			1
@entity3 was 16 when he first tore his hamstring – the three muscles that run up the back of the leg from the knee , enabling it to bend and straighten			1
about 6,000 @entity11 suffer similar damage to the soft tissues of the legs each year , but not all are sporting figures			2
causes can range from obesity to car accidents			2
‘ it was at the @entity68 in @entity69 , ’ @entity3 recalls			1
‘ i ’d just launched into my jump and it popped			2
the pain is instant , really sharp and acute			2
as soon as i landed i knew it was bad and i would n’t be able to walk properly			2
i got up and had to be helped off the track , hobbling			2
from then on it spiralled into a never - ending cycle of tears and recovery			1
’ a hamstring strain occurs when one of the three muscles is stretched too far			2
it often happens in sports involving a lot of sudden stopping and starting , such as tennis and football			2
hamstring injuries can range from a minor tear – muscles are made up of bunches of fibres , some of which can rupture if overstretched – to , more rarely , a complete break			2
golden oxygen : long - jumper @entity3 suffers from repeated hamstring tears and would not have had a career in athletics - let alone an @entity2 gold - without @entity41 injury is usually treated with rest , ice to reduce swelling , painkillers and anti-inflammatory medication along with leg elevation and stretching exercises			1
it can take up to ten weeks to recover fully , with severe cases that need surgery taking longer			2
although one tear does n’t necessarily leave you vulnerable to another , those playing sport regularly will always be more prone to them			2
by 2007 , @entity3 was averaging five tears a year , needing up to eight weeks of recovery			1
the following year , in despair at the constant pain , he nearly quit athletics altogether , despite being in full - time training			1
‘ i ’d be training , then have a tear , then recover for a while , then still be affected for another four weeks when i got back into training and then i ’d tear it again			2
it got to a stage where i thought , “ if this does n’t change , i ’m never going to have a chance of winning at the @entity2			2
” ’ he started looking for a job			0
‘ i was very frustrated			0
i thought i ’d have to quit and do something else			0
i was looking at any kind of sales work that would pay relatively well because i ’d taken on a mortgage			0
’ @entity41 : patient being taken into hyperbaric chamber what is it ? @entity40 involves breathing pure oxygen while sitting in a sealed steel - and - concrete chamber			1
the atmospheric pressure inside is increased			0
oxygen is usually delivered via a mask			1
each session can take five hours and costs between £ 180 and £ 1,000			0
what can it treat ? although initially used only on divers , by the @entity152 the therapy was being used to treat carbon monoxide , cyanide and hydrogen sulfide poisoning			0
it is now advocated for an array of illnesses from strokes to multiple sclerosis ( @entity162 )			0
@entity163 does it work ? pressurised oxygen is dissolved into the blood and body cells , tissues and fluids at up to ten times the normal concentration , stimulating blood flow and healing tissue			1
who gets it on the @entity48 ? thousands of @entity11 with a variety of illness claim @entity41 works where established drugs do n’t , but the treatment is rarely offered on the @entity48			1
only patients with decompression illness get automatic funding			0
are they the only ones ? conditions where funding may be considered by the @entity48 included acute carbon - monoxide poisoning and diabetic foot ulcers			1
for everything else , funding is denied			0
but his family and then girlfriend of eight years , @entity189 , 24 – from whom he parted a fortnight ago – persuaded him to persevere			0
determined not to let them down , he began looking for alternative treatments			0
@entity195 ( @entity195 ) doctors were already aware of @entity41 , and his new @entity197 coach , @entity196 , had seen the effect on sportspeople in the @entity197			0
it could n’t have come too soon			0
just a month before the @entity201 in 2009 – and 12 days before the qualifying rounds – @entity3 pulled the tendon again			1
he started getting up at 5am every day to travel from his home town of @entity205 to the @entity206 , where his nearest @entity41 chamber was housed			0
for @entity3 , the positive effects were almost instant			1
‘ you sit in a big metal tube , about 6ft wide and 5ft tall			0
it ’s quite hot , but not unpleasant , as i ’m ok in confined spaces			0
you breathe oxygen through a face mask			1
i would go in on my own but you can have others in there			0
’ after three days , he started to notice a difference in the way his knee felt			0
‘ the movement was better than it normally would be and after that it kept getting better			0
i could n’t believe that something so simple as oxygen and pressure could be having this effect			1
’ historic leap : the jump which got him his @entity5 gold at the @entity228 this summer during the 2012 games twelve days later , @entity3 sailed through the qualifying rounds for the @entity201 and went on to break the @entity11 record for long - jump			1
‘ i was ecstatic , ’ he says			0
‘ the relief was incredible			0
finally , there was a solution to my problems and for the first time hope that maybe i could win gold at the @entity2			1
’ although @entity41 therapy means recovery time from such an injury is shortened to sometimes only ten days , it does not prevent further injury – and @entity3 has suffered four similar tears since			1
‘ it cuts down the recovery time by about 30 per cent for me			1
it ’s still painful but for a shorter period			0
so now i can stay upbeat when it happens			0
i had my last tear in january and it was a relatively nasty one , but i remained positive , knowing i had a good chance at the @entity2			0
’ but evidence for @entity41 is patchy , with studies showing its efficacy only in certain conditions and a randomised , double - blind controlled trial into its use in repairing adverse effects of radiotherapy by @entity206 ’s @entity260 still ongoing			0
‘ it ’s difficult to produce hard scientific data to back it up , ’ says dr @entity261 , a gp specialising in @entity41			0
‘ because oxygen is so cheap , there are n’t the drug companies willing to sponsor trials into it			1
’ around the world , @entity41 is administered for an array of conditions including insomnia , burns , @entity275 , stroke , multiple sclerosis and liver disease			0
in this country , access may soon become much harder			0
‘ in the past it was a real postcode lottery , ’ explains dr @entity281 , an @entity48 consultant in anaesthesia and medical director at the @entity284			1
‘ but currently there are discussions taking place within specialist commissioning groups for a nationwide system that will make access more uniform but will almost certainly limit availability to very few conditions			0
we know it helps heal damage caused by radiotherapy , for instance			1
but funding is so difficult to get that we have ended up offering some very burned patients treatment for free			1
’ @entity3 believes the treatment should be offered to more @entity48 patients , so they can benefit as he did			1
thanks to speedier recovery and a change in his jumping technique , putting less strain on the hamstrings , his optimism was realised			1
after nine years battling against injury , he won @entity11 ’s 13th gold medal , with a jump of 8m 31cm			0
‘ i always believed it was possible but finally , finally it came true , ’ he says			0
‘ if only everyone had the same access to the treatment that i did			1

olympic medallist @entity3 credits *success* to oxygen treatment which helps him heal torn hamstrings at half the normal recovery time
