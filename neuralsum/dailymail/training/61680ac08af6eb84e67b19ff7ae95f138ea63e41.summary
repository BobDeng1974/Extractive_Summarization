the medic , who did not attend the hearing , instructed his solicitors to ask the @entity27 panel to restrict his role - allowing him to conduct examinations in the presence of a chaperone or only seeing male patients			2

announcing the decision to strike @entity10 off , he added : ‘ in all the circumstances , the panel has concluded that the nature of dr @entity10 ’s convictions is so serious as to be fundamentally incompatible with his continuing to be a registered medical practitioner			1
‘ for these reasons , the panel has determined that erasure is the only means of protecting patients , maintaining public confidence in the profession and declaring and upholding proper standards of conduct and behaviour			0
’ @entity89 , for the @entity1 , earlier told the panel the doctor ’s crimes had ‘ brought the profession into disrepute			2

‘ when he returned he continued to massage @entity29 and despite her saying she needed to leave he continued to massage her back and down her sides as previously , ’ mr @entity89 said			0
‘ he started to place his hands underneath her body and fully onto her chest and breast , rubbing his hands over her breasts down her body and onto her stomach			0
‘ he focused more and more on her breasts , stroking her breasts repeatedly , moving his hands down onto her stomach			0
’ by this time she was very uncomfortable , but the doctor continued despite her telling him she needed to go , the hearing was told			0

in a statement produced in the crown court trial she said : ‘ the incident initially left me feeling scared about what was going to happen			0
‘ i did n’t know what to do and did n’t feel like i could just get up and leave because he was a doctor and you put your trust in doctors			0
‘ it left me feeling violated and upset and i felt like i did n’t know what to do with myself			0
