an old housing commission terrace in @entity2 's @entity1 has set a new record in the historic inner city suburb , selling for $ 3.95 million at a secret night - time auction			1
the victorian - era five - bedroom house ' @entity7 ' is the fourth of 293 state - owned houses to go under the hammer in a government plan to sell off public housing and relocate 600 housing tenants			1
the sale price was much larger than expected			0
buyers were given an estimate of $ 2.7 million in marketing material handed out before the auction , @entity15 reports			0
11 @entity20 in @entity1 sold for $ 3.95 million last night , setting a new record for terraces in the suburb built in 1879 , ' @entity7 ' is one of several recent heritage listings along @entity26 , which runs from the @entity2 harbour foreshore at @entity28 up to @entity29 in the city 's historic the @entity31 district			1
with prime views of the @entity34 and easy access to the tourist hot - spot the @entity31 , the terraces are hotly sought after by developers			0
the first heritage - listed home at 119 @entity40 recently went under the hammer for $ 1.9million			2
the second at 23 lower @entity20 sold for $ 2.685million			0
the sales have delivered a windfall to the @entity46 government of more than $ 11million so far , with two more properties - 86 @entity48 and 30 @entity49 - due to be sold in the coming weeks , according to the @entity50			1
the old @entity1 social housing terraces command some of @entity2 's best harbour views but the state government 's mass relocation of public housing residents has triggered claims of economic cleaning in the inner city area , and thursday night 's auction saw around 40 @entity1 residents turn up to voice their complaints			1
@entity62 from the @entity63 said the heritage of @entity2 's first neighbourhood will be lost with the sales			2
' they 're not only selling the bricks and mortar of the area , they 're selling our history and our heritage , ' he told the @entity75			1
' the thing we 're really angry about is the fact that some of these properties have been vacant for so many years , some for as many as seven years , ' he said			0
' the property in @entity81 has been vacant for the last three years - meanwhile we have all these people sleeping rough on the streets who could have had a roof over their heads			0
' i call it ' eviction by dereliction , ' he said			0
' we 've been asking to get work done on these places for so many years and they would n't do it , now they 're making repairs because they 're going to make some money of their own			0
' no surrender : a mural at @entity26 protesting the @entity46 government 's moves to sell off social housing and evict 600 residents at @entity1 the @entity107 terrace ' @entity108 ' sold for $ 2.68 million , almost double its forecast value the minister for family and @entity111 , @entity112 , says the sale of the @entity1 properties will return hundreds of millions of dollars to the public housing system to help the 58,000 people currently on the housing waiting list			1
' this is all about reinvesting money back into the public housing system by selling properties that are very costly to maintain , ' ms @entity112 said			1
' the age and heritage nature of the @entity1 properties mean they often cost four times as much to maintain as the average social housing property			2
' the government says that for every house sold in @entity1 , it can build three houses elsewhere			1
the old social housing terraces in @entity1 occupy prime foreshore land and are within walking distance to the historic @entity31 precinct some of the @entity1 terraces being sold - off have been vacant for at least three years mr @entity62 said the elevated prices being received for the properties raises suspicions			1
' how can you undervalue a place by half to a million dollars ? one real estate agent told me that if a place goes for 10 - 20 per cent more than it is valued at , that 's buyer excitement - but if it goes for 80 - 90 % more than expected ? something 's wrong , ' he says			1
a spokesperson for the @entity50 , who are managing the terrace sales , says the price guide is set by the sales agents			0
' they 're set by market feedback , obviously there 's not a lot of market detail for these kind of properties in the precinct that have n't been sold for 100 years - so the agents are going by what buyers have told them , ' he told the @entity75			2
this property at 86 @entity48 will go to auction later this month mr @entity62 said he and at least 200 other @entity1 residents who have been issued with eviction notices will ' fight this to the end			2
' ' we 're in a lot of talks with the opposition at the moment			0
@entity175 says they 'll stop the sale if they get into government , they 're formulating a housing policy and have asked for our input , ' he said			0
' it 's hard for some of the more elderly people here , they do n't have the energy , but i 'll fight this to the end , it 's my home			0
