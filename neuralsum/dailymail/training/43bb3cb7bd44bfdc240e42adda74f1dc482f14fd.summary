by @entity1 science correspondent and @entity2 rabbits , piglets and mice are being killed when heavily pregnant , injected with deadly bacteria and bled to death by food firms testing fashionable superfoods , it has emerged			1
the experiments involve food giants including @entity14 maker @entity13 , @entity15 - the owners of @entity18 - @entity16 , @entity19 ’s and @entity20 , the maker of probiotic drinks			1
food companies stress that animals are used as little as possible and are cared for to the highest standard			2
according to the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) animals including rabbits , rats , mice and piglets suffered as a result of the growing fascination with so - called ' superfoods ' but the campaign group that uncovered details of the experiments , which were carried out over the past two years , claim that most were not done to assess the safety of the food			1
instead , they say the tests appear to have been carried out to allow the companies make health claims about their products			1
examples given by the @entity25 include a @entity15 experiment in which piglets were given an extract of @entity49 ’s tea to see if it could counter diarrhoea caused by the @entity53 stomach bug			2
eight of the month - old animals died , with severe diarrhoea to blame in at least seven of the cases			0
rabbits were historically used to test new medical treatments such as anesthetics in another paper , also published in a scientific journal , @entity13 scientists investigating the health benefits of goji berries , a vitamin - rich ‘ superfood ’ , gave mice a powder based on the sweet red fruit			1
the animals were then injected with acid to produce the symptoms of bowel disease before being killed and dissected			0
and in experiments into whether the ‘ friendly bacteria ’ found in @entity20 ’s probiotic drinks can help ease the effects of a bad diet , mice bled to death after having their hearts punctured			2
@entity15 is also named by the @entity25 for experiments involving @entity83 ( @entity84 ) , a spiny cactus used by tribesmen of the @entity87 desert to stave off hunger pangs and seen as a potential appetite suppressant in the weight - conscious western world			2
to test the safety of the plant in pregnancy , it was fed to pregnant rabbits , which were then killed just before they were due to give birth			0
the @entity25 says that obesity should be tackled through lifestyle changes , rather than ‘ quick fixes ’ such as pills and supplements			0
animal testing is common for food and beauty companies , yet many claim it is for safety reasons			1
this image was taken in 1996 in @entity110 and shows a macaque being subjected to tests at the @entity113 it says that other products that are already in use , such as tea , or probiotic yoghurt , could be tested by on the people who regularly eat or drink them			0
a spokesman said : ‘ this type of research is not only cruel but it is also unnecessary			0
‘ as well as preventing the suffering of thousands of animals , human studies can provide a more realistic and human - relevant approach to assessing the health benefits of food			0
’ dr @entity130 , the @entity25 ’s head of science , said : ' the public will be shocked to learn these well - known and familiar high street brands are involved in sickening experiments on animals			0
‘ it is unacceptable that animals should be made to suffer by companies in an effort to make “ health benefit ” claims about their products			1
major names including @entity15 , @entity13 , @entity20 and @entity144 have allegedly been involved in ' sickening ' tests on animals ‘ the @entity25 is calling on such food giants to stop testing their food products and ingredients on animals			1
' a spokesman for @entity13 said that one of the firm ’s focuses of research is foods that help people with medical conditions including bowel problems			0
he added : ‘ @entity13 does not use animal testing to develop conventional foods and drinks , such as coffee , tea , cereal and chocolate			1
‘ however , animal studies are critically important to make advances in fundamental nutrition and health science			1
‘ this research helps to provide the scientific basis for developing novel ingredients , or new nutritional strategies for improving health and wellness			0
‘ this includes medical foods that help people with acute and chronic medical conditions			0
’ @entity15 said it does not test tea or tea - based products on animals			2
if tests are required by law for safety reasons , they are kept to a minimum and carried out by third parties			0
the firm said it is ‘ committed to the elimination of animal testing ’ .			1

@entity13 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity19 *'s* and @entity20 *accused* of animal testing
campaign group claims tests were not to assess food safety but to allow the companies to make health claims about their products
