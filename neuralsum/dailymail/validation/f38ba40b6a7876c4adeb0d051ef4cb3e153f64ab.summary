@entity0 should resign or be sacked as chairman of the @entity2 , a leading mp demanded yesterday			1
@entity4 said mrs @entity5 , who is also a director of @entity6 , had been either ‘ incredibly naive or totally incompetent ’ over the tax evasion scandal at the bank ’s @entity9 division			1
the 53 - year - old was criticised by mps on the powerful @entity13 as they grilled her over allegations that the embattled bank helped wealthy clients to hide billions of pounds from the taxman			1
but @entity12 said her performance at the bank was not good enough – raising serious questions over whether she is suitable for her @entity2 role			1
committee chairman @entity4 said : ‘ i really do think you should consider your position and consider resigning and if not , the government should sack you			1
either you knew or you did n’t know – and i think in that case that you are either incredibly naive or totally incompetent			0
‘ i do n’t think that the performance you ’ve shown here , and your record as a guardian of @entity6 give me confidence that you should be the guardian of the licence fee			0
’ @entity40 mp mrs @entity4 added : i ’ve met you once and i like you but i do n’t think you are fit for the job … i ’m afraid you ’ve lost my trust			2
’ mrs @entity5 has already come under considerable pressure over potential conflicts between her multiple jobs , since she started as chairman of the @entity2 last september			1
@entity13 chairman @entity4 said ms @entity5 had lost her trust , but @entity49 committee member @entity48 disagreed with the call for her to resign in addition to the £ 110,000 - a - year position , on which she spends three days a week , she is a non-executive director of @entity53 and @entity6			1
last year she received more than £ 513,000 in fees and benefits for her work at the troubled bank , including a £ 334,000 fee as non-executive chairman of @entity60			2
yesterday , mps marvelled at the fact that she is paid so much , but did not do more to find out about @entity6 ’s alleged efforts to help tax evaders			0
mrs @entity5 was one of a panel of @entity6 bosses hauled in front of the committee who spent the session trying to blame others for the tax evasion scandal at its division in @entity9			2
leaked files showed that more than 1,000 people from the @entity76 had secret accounts at @entity6 ’s @entity9 bank , including a number of @entity49 donors			0
the @entity13 of @entity12 was taking on tax avoidance and evasion : @entity6 in @entity83 but she argued that the chief culprits were those who had evaded tax and people on the front line , rather than the non-executive directors			0
‘ we relied on three layers of board oversight and multiple layers of executive oversight to raise issues of material importance to the audit committee , ’ mrs @entity5 said			0
‘ we were reliant on [ reports from ] specialists … it was n’t flagged so you ’ve got to ask , “ what more can you do ? ’ ’ ’ mps responded that the @entity2 chief sounded too ‘ passive ’ , and accused the wider @entity6 board of ‘ extraordinary ’ blindness			2
last week mrs @entity5 told a conference that she would prioritise her job at the @entity2 over her other positions , and that she was keeping her roles on the @entity6 and @entity53 boards ‘ under review ’			1
she also took the unusual step of recommending that the @entity2 should be abolished			0
it was time for oversight by a tough external regulator , she said .			0

@entity13 chairman @entity4 urges resignation
says mps can not have confidence in @entity121 to run @entity2 *watchdog*
@entity5 says she had been ' *unyielding* ' about any wrongdoing at bank
