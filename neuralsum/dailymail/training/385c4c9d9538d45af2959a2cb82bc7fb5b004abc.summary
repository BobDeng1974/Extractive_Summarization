by @entity1 reporter published : 10:47 est , 10 february 2014 @entity3 : 11:18 est , 10 february 2014 babies conceived on @entity5 are the least likely to suffer from @entity6 , a leading charity has revealed			2
@entity8 says that women whose pregnancies span the summer months absorb greater vitamin d from a stronger sun - which research shows has a positive impact on immune system development			1
it means , the charity says , november - born babies are far less likely to have the chronic condition compared to those born in may			0
time for a november baby : babies conceived on @entity5 are the least likely to suffer from @entity6 affecting nearly 100,000 people in the @entity23 , @entity6 is the most common disabling neurological condition for young adults today and @entity8 is campaigning for greater awareness of the crippling nerve condition			1
@entity28 , founder of @entity8 and diagnosed with @entity6 nine years ago , said : ' our charity is aimed at young people and the forum is full of comments about how starting a family is a worry			1
@entity6 is a very uncertain condition to live with , no two cases are the same and it can impact lives on completely different scales			2
' we hope these findings will help reduce the risk for future generations and gives an excuse to have an enjoyable @entity5			0
sunshine : @entity8 says that women whose pregnancies span the summer months absorb greater vitamin d from a stronger sun - which research shows has a positive impact on immune system development researchers are now calling for pregnant women to be given vitamin d supplements to cut cases of the disease - an issue especially relevant to @entity23 women who absorb less sunlight than those nearer the equator			1
@entity6 usually strikes people in their 20s and 30s and affects 2.5million people around the world , including 85,000 @entity23			1
it can cause blindness and paralysis , but current drugs are not suitable for all and there is no cure			0
multiple sclerosis occurs when ‘ friendly fire ' from the body 's immune system , destroys myelin , the fatty protective sheath around nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord , disrupting the transmission of signals vital to everything from seeing and walking to thinking and bladder control			1
the research shows white blood cells called t cells to be pivotal to the process			0
it is thought that overactive t cells accumulate in the brain , where , with the help of other immune cells they produce a chemical ‘ soup ’ that destroys the myelin and short - circuits the signalling process			0
it is already known that @entity6 cases are higher in countries like @entity23 which are further away from the equator with relatively low sunlight levels			2
diabetes , asthma and life - threatening heart disease in babies are also linked to low levels of vitamin d in early life			0
dr @entity112 , of @entity113 , @entity114 , who conducted the biggest study of its kind on the relationship of vitamin d and @entity6 in 2011 , told the @entity1 at the time : ' around 90 per cent of women are vitamin d deficient during the winter months which means pregnant women are especially at risk			1
' dr @entity112 said the notion that vitamin d deficiency contributed to @entity6 was first aired in the 1960s			2
' it was laughed at ' he said			0
' no one could believe a simple vitamin would have this sort of impact			0
it is only by consistent replication of studies showing a link that we can say it is a genuine one			0
' we believe the government should get behind this and tell midwives and pregnant women that taking supplements can have health benefits for the baby ' he said			1

@entity8 says *exposure* to sunshine during pregnancy reduces @entity6 risks
summer pregnancies absorb more vitamin d for healthier immune system
@entity6 is the most common neurological condition affecting young adults in @entity23
neurologists have urged pregnant women to take vitamin d supplements
