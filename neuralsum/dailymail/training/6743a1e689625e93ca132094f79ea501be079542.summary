@entity2 inspectors are favouring ‘ trendy ’ learning methods over traditional ‘ chalk and talk ’ teaching , a report claims today			1
they prefer child - led activities to such an extent that it is ‘ inconceivable ’ for teachers to allow pupils to learn from textbooks during a visit from the watchdog			1
an examination of @entity2 reports by the think - tank @entity16 reveals that inspectors show an ‘ aversion ’ to direct teacher instruction and like group work instead			1
guidance : @entity2 inspectors , led by sir @entity24 ( pictured ) , are said to prefer ' trendy ' and ' jazzy ' teaching methods this is resulting in staff putting on ‘ jazzy ’ lessons to impress them , according to the study , playing @entity30 : the enduring influence of the preferred @entity2 teaching style			1
@entity33 , a history teacher and education research fellow for @entity16 , examined 130 @entity2 reports of secondary schools inspected between september and october last year			1
of these , 52 per cent showed a preference for lessons in which pupils learn independently from teachers and 42 per cent favoured group work			2
eighteen per cent criticised teachers for talking too much and the same proportion criticised lessons because the pupils were ‘ too passive ’			2
there was only one example of an inspector recommending a more teacher - led approach			2
two months later , @entity2 issued new guidance for inspectors which stated they should not back one style of teaching over another in the course of their work			0
and in january this year , sir @entity24 , chief inspector of schools , wrote to inspectors saying : ‘ please , please , please think carefully before criticising a lesson because it does not conform to a particular view of how children should be taught			2
’ mr @entity33 studied an additional 130 reports of inspections conducted between january and march this year to assess whether inspectors had taken the guidance on board			0
only 8 per cent demonstrated a preference for pupil independence and there were no reports of inspectors criticising teachers for talking too much			0
two per cent flagged up the ‘ passivity ’ of pupils			0
but mr @entity33 claims the changes are ‘ largely superficial ’ and that ‘ fundamental problems ’ remain because reports have simply been rewritten to ensure signs of ‘ bias ’ are not included			0
inspectors have been given a list of ‘ banned ’ phrases to prevent schools from thinking the watchdog has a preferred style of teaching			0
@entity88 – which is contracted by @entity2 – provided its inspectors with alternative ways of making comments in may			0
instead of writing that ‘ too much teacher talk dominates ’ , it was suggested that inspectors could write ‘ explanations are not clear ’			2
techniques : an examination of @entity2 reports by the think - tank @entity16 reveals that inspectors show an ‘ aversion ’ to direct teacher instruction and like group work instead ( file picture ) inspectors are also still backing child - led learning in verbal feedback to staff , according to mr @entity33			1
one teacher told @entity16 : ‘ “ too much teacher talk ” is often verbally mentioned in feedback but , due to new criteria , not written down			1
’ writing in the report , mr @entity33 claims inspections are ‘ distinctly in favour of child - centred teaching methods and prejudiced against more teacher - led alternatives ’			1
he said : ‘ teachers are accustomed to putting on “ jazzy ” lessons , replete with group work , role play and active learning in order to fulfil what has become widely acknowledged as the @entity2 style			1
‘ so strong is the inspectorate ’s reputation for favouring trendy teaching methods that the idea of putting on a “ chalk and talk ” lesson or learning from a textbook with an @entity2 inspector in the room has become inconceivable within the teaching profession			1
’ in june , @entity2 announced a pilot scheme in the @entity138 to end grading teaching quality on each lesson observation form			0
instead , lead inspectors will form an overall judgment on teaching in the school from their team ’s summaries			0
an @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ as @entity151 chief inspector sir @entity24 has repeatedly made clear , @entity2 does not have a preferred teaching style			0
it is up to the classroom teacher to determine how they should teach			0

study by think - tank @entity16 revealed inspectors prefer ' trendy ' methods
it also suggests they show an ' aversion ' to direct teacher instruction
this results in staff putting on ' jazzy ' lessons in order to impress children
