by @entity0 published : 15:09 est , 16 july 2013 updated : 18:01 est , 16 july 2013 a grieving mother has called for a ban on coach operators using old tyres after a coroner ruled that the failure of a tyre that was nearly 20 years old caused the crash which killed three people , including her 18 - year - old son , on their way back from a music festival			1
@entity15 coroner @entity14 questioned why it was legal for such old tyres to be used after hearing how driver @entity18 battled to control the 52 - seat coach on the @entity20 in @entity15			1
as the front nearside tyre blew out the vehicle was sent veering up an embankment , through a fence and into a tree			1
scroll down for @entity26 ... emergency services at the scene of a coach crash on the @entity20 near @entity30 in @entity15 , in which three people died			1
questions were raised as to why there is no restriction on age of tyres mr @entity18 , 63 , from @entity37 , died along with passengers @entity38 , 23 , of @entity40 , @entity41 , and musician @entity42 , 18 , from @entity43 , @entity41			1
mr @entity14 said he would be writing to the @entity44 to highlight the issue			0
speaking after the inquest , mr @entity42 ’s mother @entity46 called for a change in the law			0
among the dead : teenager @entity42 , of @entity51 , @entity41 , and @entity38 , 23 , of @entity40 , @entity52 , were on the coach which crashed on its way to @entity52 from the @entity56			2
a verdict of accidental death was given by the coroner , despite the coach having 20 year old tyres coach driver @entity18 , from @entity37 , was at the wheel before the coach veered off the road and ploughed into a tree			1
he had just seconds to react ' it ’s shocking that we do not have legislation about the age of tyres in this country and we never want any other family to go through what has happened , ' she told reporters			1
' if that tyre had been of a good age @entity42 , @entity38 and @entity18 would be alive			1
' mr @entity42 and miss @entity38 were sitting in window seats in the two rows directly behind the driver and all three died instantly in the crash from multiple injuries			2
mr @entity18 , described as an experienced , safe and careful driver , had only three seconds to react and was helpless to prevent the crash			1
three people dead : emergency crews on the scene : the mangled remains of the coach being recovered from the roadside on the @entity20 another young victim : @entity93 graduate @entity92 , of @entity40 , @entity52 , was described as keen on music and she had been to @entity96 several times the coach , operated by @entity98 , was heading back to @entity52 from the @entity96 festival on the @entity100 just before midnight on september 10 last year			1
the company is due at @entity102 ’ court on august 12 to answer a charge of using a defective tyre on the vehicle , but not the one that caused the accident			1
concluding the inquest into the tragedy today , mr @entity14 said the ' catastrophic failure ' of the tyre , which was two years older than the coach , had caused the accident and he recorded a verdict of accidental death			1
where it happened ' the real explanation that this tyre failed so catastrophically is through age , ' he said			1
' i formally announce that i will be writing a rule 43 report to draw attention to the @entity123 of the very dangers caused by the fact that vehicles , be they private , commercial or public , are legally able to drive on tyres without restriction on age , and by reason of age are potentially in a perilous condition , which there is no realistic means of detecting			1
' the two - day inquest heard that the tyre had been bought second hand , had never been retreaded and was perfectly legal to use			2
there were no other defects to the 17 - year - old coach that contributed to the crash			2
but tyre expert @entity144 said the tyre was ' abnormally old ' and that caused the accident as it finally failed			2
' it is known that tyres deteriorate significantly with age , ' he said			2
there are presently no laws to stop old tyres being used but some car manufacturers recommend tyres more than 10 years old are scrapped			2
mr @entity144 explained that the tyre had been delaminating , or falling apart internally , for perhaps months but this would not have been noticeable to the eye			2
he said that it was only half worn so had either been a spare or in storage for years			0
he added that a lack of a legal requirement about the age of tyres was ' frustrating '			2
the vehicle was full of friends who had left @entity52 on september 5 to go south for the festival and each paid £ 56 to hire the coach			0
survivors spoke of waking up and seeing the tree looming towards them as the coach went up the embankment , then scrambling out while smelling fuel			1
many suffered serious injuries , the inquest in @entity175 , @entity15 , was told			0
@entity178 , who was driving her ex-partner @entity179 , was behind the coach and said in a statement : ' it just left the road			0
there were no brake lights , no skidding - it just glided off the road and then up the embankment			0
' mr @entity42 had just turned 18 and was a ' talented and gifted musician '			0
the teenager was once a member of the aspiring @entity41 band @entity192 but had gone solo			0
@entity93 graduate miss @entity38 was described as keen on music and she had been to @entity96 several times			0
her father @entity196 said his daughter had the travelling bug and hoped to teach @entity93 abroad			0
mr @entity18 was described as a safe and considerate driver who loved his part - time job with the company			1
tests showed he had not consumed alcohol or drugs			0
mrs @entity46 said she would consider legal action against the coach operators			0
' if @entity98 can be held to account for this then that is what we will do			0
' she pointed out that the tyre was older than her son , adding : ' we have heard horrendous evidence and this has traumatised so many families			0
there were 52 really happy and healthy people on that coach			0
