at first glance you might think @entity2 has adjusted pretty well to @entity4 ' hostile environment			0
despite the chilly − 63 ° c temperatures and lack of oxygen , the mp appears relaxed , wearing just a suit and tie			0
but the secretary of state for business is in fact visiting a test yard in @entity14 , @entity15 , designed to replicate @entity4			1
the new @entity17 ‘ @entity16 ( 30 metres ) by 43ft ( 13 metres ) and contains more than 300 tonnes of sand meaning engineers can test the next generation of vehicles destined to explore the red planet			2
explorer ? @entity23 business secretary @entity2 stands with the ' @entity25 ' rover on the @entity16 at @entity26 in @entity14			0
the @entity16 provides a test bed area for prototype rover vehicles that may be used to obtain data from the surface of @entity4 @entity32 's first @entity4 rover will be able to autonomously navigate up to 230 ft ( 70 metres ) a day with no outside guidance from ground control			1
the next generation @entity35 will be tested in the @entity16 to give the @entity38 team a chance to finalise its sophisticated autonomous navigation system			1
@entity2 said : ' the @entity35 rover represents the best of @entity23 high - value manufacturing			1
' the technologies developed as part of the programme , such as autonomous navigation systems , new welding materials and techniques , will also have real impacts on other sectors , helping them stay on the cutting edge			2
the @entity25 ( pictured , left ) and @entity54 rovers ( pictured , right ) are shown on the @entity16 test area at @entity26 in @entity14			0
the @entity16 will be used up until its launch and will also be kept available after the rover has landed on the surface of @entity4 in 2019 ' not only is it hugely exciting that @entity32 's next mission to @entity4 will be @entity23 built , but it is incredibly rewarding to see the benefits of our investment in the @entity64 ( @entity64 ) creating jobs here in the @entity23			1
' the facility was opened by @entity2 as well as chief executive of the @entity68 , dr @entity69 and director of science and @entity71 at @entity64 , @entity72			0
dr @entity72 said : ' a facility like this enables us to develop sophisticated navigation systems to “ teach ” @entity4 rovers how to drive autonomously across the @entity4			0
this will be a fantastic resource for the @entity35 rover team and for future missions to come			1
' surreal : @entity84 , @entity85 and control engineer for @entity86 and @entity26 , is pictured making final adjustments to the @entity16 at @entity26 in @entity14 the walls , doors and all interior surfaces are painted a reddish - brown colour mimicking the background colour on @entity4 , and the yard also includes a large mural of the @entity4 landscape			0
these features ensure the rover navigation cameras see as realistic a @entity4 landscape as possible			2
the @entity16 will be used up until launch and will also be kept available after the rover has landed on the surface of @entity4 in 2019 in case engineers need to address any problem by simulating the situation on @entity105			0
@entity106 : the walls , doors , and all interior surfaces are painted a reddish - brown colour mimicking the background colour on @entity4 , and the yard also includes a large mural of the @entity4 landscape manufacture of the rover will begin early in 2015 after construction of an advanced clean room at @entity26 ’ @entity14 site and mission launch is planned for 2018			1
@entity118 , head of @entity26 in the @entity23 said : ' @entity35 is a hugely fascinating programme and the new yard brings us one step closer to launch			2

the new @entity124 ' has been *unveiled* at the *company* 's *complex* in @entity15 and features *300tonnes* of sand
the yard will be used to test the autonomous navigation system of @entity32 's next generation @entity35 rover
manufacture of the rover will begin early in 2015 and mission launch is planned for 2018
