the 31 - year - old suffered burns as she slid along the wooden track , shredding her red , white and blue outfit			1

on track : @entity1 ( right ) alongside @entity16 of @entity17 in the women 's sprint semi finals losing her balance : @entity1 begins to fall from her bike mid-race but soon afterwards she was back in the saddle – and going for gold			1
resuming her best - of - three races semi-final against @entity17 @entity16 , she levelled the score at 1 - 1 when @entity16 was ruled to have strayed out of line			2

the cyclist looked tearful as she accepted her medal and modestly minimised the effects of her accident			2
crashing out : it looks to be all over as she lies injured beside the track the holes in her outfit show the force of the crash - and her painful burns			1
but she battles on and defeats @entity16 she told journalists : ‘ it ’s not too bad			0
my dad always said you do n’t do track cycling unless you ’re prepared to crash			0
i could tell it was just surface wounds			0
’ miss @entity16 said of the crash : ‘ i was right next to her : i heard it , saw it and felt it , the vibrations through the wood			0
‘ for her to pick herself up after that heavy fall and come back as hard as she did is a mark of the woman and the great champion that she is			2
’ miss @entity1 , who grew up near @entity72 , @entity73 , now lives in @entity74			1
