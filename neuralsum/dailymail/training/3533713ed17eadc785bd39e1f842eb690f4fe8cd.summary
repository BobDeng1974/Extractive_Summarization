it later emerged his vein had ruptured			0
@entity95 director @entity94 , left , called off the failed execution			0

' @entity94 , the department 's director , halted @entity2 's execution about 20 minutes after the first drug was administered			1
he later said there had been vein failure			0
the execution began at 6:23 p.m. , when officials began administering the first drug , the sedative midazolam			2
a doctor declared @entity2 to be unconscious at 6:33 p.m. once an inmate is declared unconscious , the state 's execution protocol calls for the second drug , a paralytic , to be administered			1
the third drug in the protocol is potassium chloride , which stops the heart			2

at 6:39 , a doctor lifted the sheet that was covering the inmate to examine the injection site			0
' there was some concern at that time that the drugs were not having that ( desired ) effect , and the doctor observed the line at that time and determined the line had blown , ' @entity94 said at a news conference afterward , referring to @entity2 's vein rupturing			1
after an official lowered the blinds , @entity94 made a series of phone calls before calling a halt to the execution			2
' after conferring with the warden , and unknown how much drugs went into him , it was my decision at that time to stop the execution , ' @entity94 told reporters			0

nightmare : @entity94 said the inmate was writhing on the gurney , pictured , and shaking uncontrollably about 13 minutes into the execution tuesday was the first time @entity8 used the drug midazolam as the first element in its execution drug combination			1
other states have used it before ; @entity135 administers 500 milligrams of midazolam as part of its three - drug combination			2
the problems with the execution are likely to fuel more debate about the ability of states to administer lethal injections that meet the @entity27 @entity278 's requirement they be neither cruel nor unusual punishment			2
that question has drawn renewed attention from defense attorneys and death penalty opponents in recent months , as several states scrambled to find new sources of execution drugs because drugmakers that oppose capital punishment - many based in @entity290 - have stopped selling to prisons and corrections departments			2
defense attorneys have unsuccessfully challenged several states ' policies of shielding the identities of the new sources of their execution drugs			0
@entity299 and @entity300 , like @entity8 , have both refused to reveal their sources , but both of those states have since successfully carried out executions with their new supplies			2
the state has stood by the execution but said monday that it 's boosting the dosages of its lethal injection drugs			0
a four - time felon , @entity2 was convicted of shooting 19 - year - old @entity34 with a sawed - off shotgun and watching as two accomplices buried her alive in rural @entity313 in 1999 after @entity314 and a friend arrived at a home the men were robbing			1
@entity123 had been scheduled to be put to death two hours later in the same room and on the same gurney			0
the 46 - year - old was convicted of raping and killing his roommate 's 11 - month - old daughter in 1997			0
he has maintained his innocence			0
@entity2 and @entity123 had sued the state for refusing to disclose details about the execution drugs , including where @entity8 obtained them			1
the case , filed as a civil matter , placed @entity8 's two highest courts at odds and prompted calls for the impeachment of state @entity337 justices after the court last week issued a rare stay of execution			1
the high court later dissolved its stay and dismissed the inmates ' claim that they were entitled to know the source of the drugs			0
by then , @entity71 had issued a stay of her own - a one - week delay in @entity2 's execution that resulted in both men being scheduled to die on the same day			1
@entity123 was served a final meal tuesday of 20 boneless chicken wings , potato wedges , cole slaw , two fruit cocktail cups and a 20 - ounce soda			2
@entity2 's request of steak , shrimp , a large baked potato and a @entity363 pecan pie was denied because it exceeded the $ 15 limit			1
he declined a separate offer from the warden for a dinner from @entity369 ' , prison officials said			0
@entity8 changed its execution protocols twice this year , leaving @entity373 officials with five options for lethal injections , including a new three - drug mixture that was used for the first time tuesday			1
two of the drugs used carry warnings that they can suppress the respiratory system and the third warns that cardiac trouble can occur at high but non-lethal doses , and lists specific steps to take if a medical patient receives too much of the drug but does n't die .			0

president @entity18 's spokesman said that the @entity5 does not believe the execution was done in a humane way
