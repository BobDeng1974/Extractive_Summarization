my aim heading to @entity2 was firstly to extend my lead in the championship over @entity5 , and then win what is my second home race after @entity8 , so it was very special to win for myself and for @entity10 as it is one of the most important grands prix on the calendar for the team			1
almost the entire @entity16 board was there , and after all the difficult times we went through as @entity10 in the first couple of years of the team , it was important to send out a good message			2
it was a picture perfect weekend for me , but not for the whole team given the problems we suffered on the other car			1
but for me i had no such worries , securing pole position and then winning the race			0
good to be home : @entity33 celebrates winning the @entity2 @entity34 winner : @entity33 ( second right ) celebrates on the podium with @entity38 ( left ) , @entity5 @entity39 uses local knowledge to triumph it was really very emotional and it was great with all the support from the home fans			1
it was also nice that @entity48 winner and @entity50 striker @entity49 came to watch the race with our ceo dr. @entity52 in the garage and to support me just as i had cheered him on him when he was representing @entity2 in @entity56 , so that was really very cool			1
given @entity5 's brake failure in qualifying and subsequent crash , i knew it would be an easier race , but i did n't prepare any differently			1
i would have got more pleasure out of the victory if it would have been a gloves - off battle with my team - mate , but of course it was a very special win nevertheless , so heading into this weekend 's race in @entity67 i am very happy			1
after the win in @entity69 , i celebrated with the team afterwards , and there was some really hilarious stuff going on			1
we were dancing together in the garage so that was a lot of fun , but with back - to - back races , there has n't been a lot of time to take in the victory			2
as we headed away from the circuit in our car some fans pulled alongside us on the motorway , and they were going crazy			0
they slid open their van door and started singing ' this is a winner , this is a winner			0
' we took a video of their chanting , and its awesome to see how much fun they get out of me winning , being a @entity2 driver in a @entity2 car in @entity2			1
a lot of people were really excited about it so it was great to witness that enthusiasm first hand			0
unfortunately the number of fans who attended the @entity2 @entity34 was down on recent years , and my impression was that people 's racing enthusiasm has decreased because of what has happened to @entity109			1
@entity69 was a place where @entity109 had so much success and i think all the spectators have been hit by what has happened to him , and the condition he is now in			0
i think that has maybe taken some excitement away from racing			0
obviously , we all still hope @entity109 makes as good a recovery as he can			0
ahead of the race there was lot of drama over the crash helmet we designed to celebrate @entity2 winning the @entity48			2
i had planned to put the @entity48 trophy on the top of my lid , but i got a call from football 's governing body @entity129 to say that it was not allowed and that i must remove it because it is a trademark			0
change : @entity33 was n't allowed to carry an image of the @entity48 on his helmet for the race losing ground : @entity5 is now 14 points behind his @entity10 team - mate in the standings trouble behind : @entity33 leads the way as @entity141 crashes at the first corner that was bit of a weird one			1
i removed it however , and everything was ok but it is incredible all the things that you have to think of			0
we never even took that into consideration when we designed the helmet ! we quickly changed the concept and replaced the trophy with four stars to represent each of @entity2 's @entity48 successes			1
this weekend i am deciding which helmet to run - whether it is the one i wore to victory in @entity2 or my usual one - so , i have asked the fans on @entity165 to vote			1
let me know what one you think i should wear at the @entity167			0
i go into this weekend 's race very confident because i have a great car			2
i know that every track we go to , if i deliver i have the chance of being on pole and winning the race , and it does not get any better than that			0
these are exciting times , ones that i can share with the team , and are well deserved			2
we went through some tough periods , but now we are getting the success we deserve which is nice to see			0
i look forward to the remainder of the season			0
@entity183 made some comments earlier this week that it would be unfair if the championship was won at the last race as a result of the new double points system			1
the concept is really artificial , i do n't like it and that is a pity , but that is the way it is and we have got to accept it			1
winning is winning , and obviously i will be happy if i win this year 's championship whatever the circumstances			2
support : @entity183 's wife offered her sympathy to her injured husband on @entity203 ahead : @entity33 dominated the race in @entity69 , leaving rivals to battle for second and third accident : @entity10 executive director @entity183 ( right ) was involved in a cycling shunt talking of @entity211 , he will be in the garage this weekend despite what happened earlier this week			2
he and a number of the team were involved in a cycling shunt on the @entity217 during a team building event			2
i did not take part , so i was n't there , and i only joined up with the team for the dinner afterwards but it was a pretty big incident and a few guys were hurt			2
@entity227 suffered broken bones but , by the time i had arrived for dinner in the evening , there was already a lot of banter flying about , jokes were being made about the crash , and a lot of people were laughing about it , so that was nice to see as it shows how tight we are as a team			0
after this race , we head into the summer break ; a four - week period before the next grand prix at the end of august in @entity246 , which i will spend with friends , family and i plan to go to @entity250			0
but before that , on thursday night , i hosted a team bbq where i invited all my mechanics out here in @entity67			1
they work their butt off for me so it is really important to spend some private time together			0
happy : the @entity2 @entity34 winner hosted a bbq with his friends and mechanics in @entity67 @entity33 's fee for his column will be donated to the @entity264 , which is dedicated to providing help to former and current @entity267 mechanics and their families , putting @entity267 mechanics throughout the world in touch with each other and raising funds to help in times of need			1
you can follow @entity33 on @entity203 @ nico_rosberg and @entity10 @ @entity277			0

it was very special to come home and win the @entity2 @entity34
my main aim was to extend my championship lead over @entity5
it was the perfect weekend for me and my team
the concept of double points is artificial and i do n't like it
i hosted a team bbq on thursday where i will be inviting all my mechanics
