by @entity1 reporter published : 07:59 est , 15 october 2012 updated : 08:49 est , 16 october 2012 two @entity2 were awarded the @entity4 economics prize on monday for studies on the match - making taking place when doctors are coupled up with hospitals , students with schools and human organs with transplant recipients			1
the work of @entity16 and @entity17 has sparked a ' flourishing field of research ' and helped improve the performance of many markets , the @entity14 said			1
@entity16 , 60 , is a professor at @entity22 in @entity23			2
@entity17 , 89 , is a professor emeritus at @entity24			2
@entity2 duo @entity16 and @entity17 win @entity32 on october 15 , 2012 duo : @entity16 , right , and @entity17 , left , won the 2012 @entity4 for economics ' this year 's prize concerns a central economic problem : how to match different agents as well as possible , ' the academy said			1
@entity17 made early theoretical inroads into the subject , using game theory to analyze different matching methods in the 1950s and ' 60s			2
together with @entity2 economist @entity42 , he developed a mathematical formula for how 10 men and 10 women could be coupled in a way so that no one would benefit from trading partners			2
while that may have had little impact on marriages and divorces , the algorithm they developed has been used to better understand many different markets			2
in the 1990s , @entity16 applied it to the market for allocating @entity2 student doctors to hospitals			2
he developed a new algorithm that was adopted by the @entity61 , which helps match resident doctors with the right hospitals			1
he also helped redesign the application process of @entity66 public high schools , ensuring that fewer students ended up in schools that were not among their top choices			2
similar formulas have been applied to efforts to match kidneys and other human organs to patients needing a transplant , the academy said			1
@entity16 was in @entity77 with his wife when he got the call from the prize committee at 3:30 a.m. ' we missed the first call because we were asleep , but we had time to wake up and think that might be what it was , ' he said			2
' my wife is going to go out and get us some coffee , and maybe we 'll absorb it			0
' he said he did n't expect things to change too much , and that he would teach a class at @entity93 on monday			0
@entity95 winner @entity16 celebrates with wife @entity96 at his home in @entity98 , @entity77 , on monday , october 15 , 2012 @entity99 : @entity2 mathematician @entity17 raises his arm outside his home after being notified that he won the 2012 economics noble prize in @entity103 , @entity77 , october 15 , 2012 ' but i imagine that they 'll be listening with renewed interest , ' he said			0
' i think this will make market design more visible to economists and people who can benefit from market design			0
' ' matching ... is about how you get all the things that you ca n't just choose but you also have to be chosen - so getting into university , getting married , getting jobs , ' he said			1
' you ca n't just have what you want ; you also have to do some courtship and there is courtship on both sides and we study the market place processes by which those types of courtship are resolved			0
' the official prize citation said the two were awarded for ' the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design			0
' @entity17 learned that he and @entity16 had won the $ 1.2 million award from an @entity135 photographer and another journalist who went to his home in @entity103 early monday			1
' matching ... is about how you get all the things that you ca n't just choose but you also have to be chosen			0
' professor @entity16 ' i consider myself a mathematician and the award is for economics , ' @entity17 said			1
' i never , never in my life took a course in economics			0
' @entity17 is the son of renowned astronomer @entity148 , whose work early in the 20th century included helping estimate the true size of the @entity153 galaxy			0
' now , i 'm ahead of my father , ' @entity17 said			0
' he got other prizes ... but he did not get a @entity4 prize			0
' ' even though these two researchers worked independently of one another , the combination of @entity17 's basic theory and @entity16 's empirical investigations , experiments and practical design has generated a flourishing field of research and improved the performance of many markets , ' the academy said			1
@entity169 , who follows academic economists on his @entity172 blog , says @entity16 's work has revolutionized the way organs are matched to patients			0
before @entity16 , he says , ' there were no economists in that business at all			0
he 's really changed it , and saved a lot of lives			0
' the @entity32 was the last of the 2012 @entity4 awards to be announced			1
@entity184 : the economics prize was created by the @entity187 central bank in @entity4 's memory in 1968 , and has been handed out with the other prizes ever since			1
each award is worth 8 million @entity187 kronor , or about $ 1.2 million it 's not technically a @entity4 , because unlike the five other awards it was n't established in the will of @entity195 , a @entity187 industrialist also known for inventing dynamite			1
the economics prize was created by the @entity187 central bank in @entity4 's memory in 1968 , and has been handed out with the other prizes ever since			1
each award is worth 8 million @entity187 kronor , or about $ 1.2 million			1
last year 's economics prize went to @entity2 economists @entity200 and @entity202 for describing the cause - and - effect relationship between the economy and government policy			1
the 2012 @entity4 in medicine , physics chemistry and literature and the @entity209 were announced last week			0
all awards will be handed out on dec. 10 , the anniversary of @entity195 's death in 1896 .			0
