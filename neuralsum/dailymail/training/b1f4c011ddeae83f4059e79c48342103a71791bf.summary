by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:53 est , 23 july 2013 updated : 12:47 est , 23 july 2013 the @entity2 staged a 61 - gun royal salute			2
the bells of @entity5 rang out for three solid hours			0
but @entity6 chose to mark the birth of the royal prince in rather more under - stated fashion : with a pair of @entity12 cufflinks			1
patriotic : the prime minister was sporting union flag cufflinks as he left @entity16 to travel to @entity17 this morning the prime minister usually wears shirts with a button cuff under his @entity22 suits			2
but as he left @entity16 today he was seen sporting silver cufflinks with a flash of red white a blue			2
he chatted on the steps of @entity27 with a cleaner about his delight at the news that the @entity31 and @entity32 were the proud parents of a baby boy			2
mr @entity6 was up early this morning to catch up on the headlines before travelling to the @entity37 factory in @entity17			1
it was announced that the firm was investing more than £ 800m and creating up to a thousand jobs to build 4,000 of its first 4x4 every year			0
but the news of the royal birth back was clearly uppermost in the prime minister ’s thoughts as he got dressed this morning			2
all smiles : @entity6 was out and about in @entity16 early this morning , and discussed the royal baby news with a cleaner on the steps of @entity27 best of @entity48 : mr @entity6 spent the day visiting the @entity37 factory in @entity17 speaking outside 10 @entity16 last night , mr @entity6 said : ‘ it is an important moment in the life of our nation but i suppose , above all , it is a wonderful moment for a warm and loving couple who have got a brand new baby boy			1
‘ it has been a remarkable few years for our @entity58 - a royal wedding that captured people 's hearts , that extraordinary and magnificent jubilee and now this royal birth - all from a family that has given this nation so much incredible service			1
‘ they can know that a proud nation is celebrating with a very proud and happy couple			1
’ but the prime minister ’s beaming address to the nation triggered speculation he had lost a front tooth			1
blast : mr @entity6 's cufflinks tribute were more understated than the 61 - gun salute at the @entity79 mind the gap : viewers watching @entity6 's statement on the royal baby thought it looked like he was missing a tooth mr @entity6 looked gap - toothed as he declared the birth ‘ an important moment in the life of our nation ’			1
senior government sources insisted the pm had not suffered a chipped tooth in the hours before news broke that the @entity96 had given birth to a boy			0
‘ they 've been like that for years , ' said a source			0
mr @entity6 sent his congratulations from @entity16 and not the @entity102 because mps have already begun their six - week summer recess			1
however a special message was sent to the new parents and the @entity107 by members of the @entity109			1
senior peers sent congratulations and urged for the family to be allowed privacy in the coming days			0
cabinet minister @entity114 said : ‘ this is a very happy , first for the @entity31 and @entity32 personally as it is for any young couple that has experienced that mixture of wonder and relief when their first child is born			2
‘ but second for the whole country because it means that the succession to the throne is further secured			0
‘ no reigning @entity48 sovereign has been able to look quite so far ahead since the birth of his @entity128 prince edward of york as a great grandson to @entity107 @entity131 in 1894			1
‘ the bells are pealing from the @entity5 , the guns have fired their salute but it is the crowds which have once again gathered outside @entity137 which are the real mark of the great affection in which the @entity58 is held			0
’ tributes : in the @entity109 @entity142 cabinet minister @entity141 and @entity144 's @entity143 said they hoped the baby prince would be given privacy he went on : ‘ we are right to celebrate this birth as a national event but i am sure we hope that the @entity31 and @entity32 but perhaps particularly the new prince can have some privacy			1
‘ royalty carries burdens as well as privilege and those burdens will fall on the young prince ’s shoulders all too soon			0
‘ the new prince could not have a better example of duty and service than that set by his great grandmother and indeed his great grandfather			0
’ @entity144 ’s @entity143 said : ‘ this is a moment of real joy for the duke and the duchess			0
it is also a moment of real happiness for people right across @entity48 who will think with special affection of the @entity32 as a new mother and her son			0
’ she added : ‘ i trust however that the nation will allow them some privacy to delight in their family life			0

@entity6 had a small patriotic tribute up his sleeve today
he said ' people will be celebrating and wishing royal couple well '
but @entity93 's address to the nation sparks @entity192 speculation about his teeth
@entity109 sends *gracious* message to @entity107 and new parents
