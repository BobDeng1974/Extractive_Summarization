@entity2 's @entity10 ambassador @entity52 wrote to the @entity10 saying that ' armed terrorist groups ' took over the @entity55 complex , which lies 60 miles north of @entity42 , on june 11			1
in a letter to @entity10 @entity58 ban ki - moon , ambassador @entity52 said remnants of a former chemical weapons programme are kept in two bunkers there			1
' the project management spotted at dawn on thursday , 12 june 2014 , through the camera surveillance system , the looting of some of the project equipment and appliances , before the terrorists disabled the surveillance system , ' @entity52 wrote in the letter dated june 30			0
' @entity72 requests the @entity73 to understand the current inability of @entity2 , owing to the deterioration of the security situation , to fulfill its obligations to destroy chemical weapons , ' he said			1
the @entity55 complex measures three by three miles and was thought to be capable of producing around 4,000 tonnes of nerve agent a year			2
@entity52 singled out the capture of bunkers 13 and 41 in the sprawling complex 35 miles ( 56 kilometers ) northwest of @entity42 in the notorious ' @entity82			2
' the last major report by @entity10 inspectors on the status of @entity2 's weapons of mass destruction program was released about a year after the experts left in march 2003			1
it states that @entity89 contained 2,500 sarin - filled 122 - mm chemical rockets produced and filled before 1991 , and about 180 tons of sodium cyanide , ' a very toxic chemical and a precursor for the warfare agent tabun			0
' however , @entity6 @entity96 spokesman rear admiral @entity95 said earlier that the @entity6 ' best understanding was that ' whatever material was kept there is pretty old and not likely to be able to be accessed or used against anyone right now '			0
' we are n't viewing this particular site and their holding it as a major issue at this point , ' @entity95 said			0
' should they even be able to access the materials , frankly , it would likely be more of a threat to them than anyone else			0
' it was revealed this week that about 5,000 chemical weapons were recovered or destroyed in @entity2 following the 2003 invasion but the @entity115 chose to keep the findings top secret			1
an investigation by @entity48 has revealed that @entity6 forces happened across the hidden caches of warheads , shells and aviation bombs between 2004 and 2011			2
secrets : in 2002 president @entity125 said @entity126 was developing a program of chemical weapons but no evidence of such weapons was ever found but the information was n't made public for several embarrassing reasons including the fact some of the weapons were @entity6 - made , plus they had been sitting dormant since the early 1980s and therefore did n't support president @entity125 's rationale for going to war			1
the weapons - most of them mustard agents in 155 - millimeter artillery shells or 122 - millimeter rockets - were developed by @entity126 during the @entity137 which raged between 1980 and 1988			0
but on september 12 , 2002 , president @entity125 had contended that @entity126 was developing new chemical weapons capable of ' mass destruction '			1
' right now , @entity2 is expanding and improving facilities that were used for the production of biological weapons , ' he said			2
but all the weapons found had been developed before 1991			0
in march 2003 , president @entity125 received a mandate from the @entity150 to lead an invasion of @entity2 , asserting that @entity2 was in violation of @entity153			0
with strong support from @entity157 p.m. @entity156 , the @entity125 administration claimed that @entity126 and his forces were in possession of weapons of mass destruction that posed a threat to @entity6 security and that of allies including the @entity157 and @entity165			2
after investigation following the invasion , the @entity6 led @entity168 concluded that @entity2 had ended its nuclear , chemical and biological programs in 1991 and had no active programs at the time of the invasion , but that they intended to resume production if the @entity2 sanctions were lifted			1
although no active chemical weapons program was found , at least 17 @entity6 troops and 7 @entity2 police officers were burned or wounded when chemical devices exploded			1
president @entity125 later said that the biggest regret of his presidency was ' the intelligence failure ' in @entity2 , while the @entity184 found in 2008 that his administration ' misrepresented the intelligence and the threat from @entity2 '			2
the @entity6 completed its withdrawal of military personnel in december 2011 , during the ninth year of the war			0
the rise of @entity0 means that the @entity6 will send an army headquarters to @entity2 for the first time in three years to assist local security forces struggling to resist advances by the fundamentalist group			1
another reason for the cover - up , according to @entity197 , was that five of the six chemical weapons encounters involved weapons designed by the @entity6 '' ' nothing of significance '' is what i was ordered to say , ' said @entity206 , a now - retired @entity208 major who was present when forces found 2,400 nerve agent rockets in 2006 - the largest chemical weapons discovery of the war			1
soldiers were also loathe to report finding the caches as documenting chemical weapons added hours of extra work to their load			2
chemical warfare specialists had to be called in , and waiting for them to arrive put coalition forces in dangerous positions			0
' i could wait all day for tech escort to show up and make a chem round disappear , or i could just make it disappear myself , ' one ex-soldier told @entity197			0
the mustard shells could be put in with other explosives that needed to be destructed and then detonated			0
however , handling chemical weapons lead to many injuries , which were not taken seriously by military doctors at the time			2
many explosive ordnance disposal personnel were not aware that the shells they were handling contained chemicals , believing them to be regular old artillery			0
at least 17 @entity6 military personnel and seven @entity2 police were sickened by poisons - usually sarin and mustard gases			2
@entity6 secretary of state @entity242 ( centre ) is greeted as he arrives at @entity244			0
he 's in the country to discuss @entity247 's nuclear program many of the shells would leak liquid during transportation , exposing the soldiers to the potentially - lethal fumes			0
symptoms ranged from disorientation and nausea to blindness and huge , seething blisters			0
@entity259 , a former @entity208 sergeant on hand for the destruction of mustard shells that burned two soldiers in his infantry company , joked of ' wounds that never happened ' from ' that stuff that did n't exist '			0
' i love it when i hear , '' oh there were n't any chemical weapons in @entity2 '' , ' he said			1

@entity0 controls a former chemical weapons factory near @entity42 , it 's claimed
the @entity17 made nerve agents in the 80s and 90s
@entity2 wrote to the @entity10 this summer to say that it had lost control of the depot
officials said that armed terrorist groups had taken over the complex
it comes after it was revealed the @entity6 found 5,000 chemical weapons in @entity2
