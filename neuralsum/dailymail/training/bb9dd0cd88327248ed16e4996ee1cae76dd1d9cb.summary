by @entity0 @entity1 , the newly crowned world 100 metres junior champion , will find out her a-level results before she runs in the 200m heats at the @entity6 in @entity7 on thursday			1
the 18 - year - old is hoping for the three ' a ' grades in @entity10 , history and biology she needs to read history at @entity14 , @entity15			1
she ' finds @entity16 really interesting ' and is fascinated by the way our perspectives on key historical events have changed over time			2
@entity22 's giggly admission she is ' quite hard to please and always sets her targets high ' quickly appears something of an understatement			1
@entity27 queen : @entity1 celebrates winning the 100m at the world juniors last month @entity30 : @entity31 celebrates crossing the line at the 100m in @entity34 , @entity35 balancing her two passions , though , has so far proved productive , as her grades and growing medal collection , which already includes world senior 4x100m bronze , world junior 100m and @entity44 junior 200m gold , have shown			1
@entity22 also happens to be the quickest @entity46 woman over 100m so far this season			1
she said : ' i know that i ’ve got to zone out from my school and university world if i ’m on a race track because it ’s not going to help me			2
knowing dates and history stuff is n’t going to help me run faster down the track			2
' i do n’t want to let my academic performance slip and i know for a fact that i ’m not going to let my athletics performance slip either			2
so i ’ll have to find a way to make the two work out			1
the two have to be at quite a high level for me to be happy			0
' i like modern history and i find @entity16 really interesting			1
i might sound really boring but i find historiography so fascinating			2
something like @entity68 and the @entity69 , the facts of it have n’t changed but as we have gone on in time we have a different perspective on it			0
' just two years ago , @entity22 stood behind the start line of the men 's @entity75 10,000m final on ' @entity77 ' ; one of 10 club runners from @entity80 and @entity81 chosen to carry the boxes of athletes ' clothing after the race			1
she was not allocated @entity87 's kit , but says it was still ' one of those moments you are never going to forget ' , even if she 's not about to get ahead of herself by thinking of her own @entity75 potential in @entity94 in 2016 and beyond			0
one for the future : the 18 - year - old will be competing in the 200m at the @entity6 balancing act : and she is set to find out her a-level results just before competing in @entity7 the transition from junior to senior can be a difficult one , but @entity22 appears to be taking it all in her stride			1
she has not been picked to run in the 4x100m relay in @entity7 , saying she would feel ' mean ' taking the place of one of the athletes who won @entity112 bronze earlier this month , yet she is clearly not daunted by the prospect of the 200m , her first senior individual event			1
' i just think that we are just not scared , ' she says			0
' i know that might sound really silly but some juniors come up and they put the seniors on a pedestal			0
they 're maybe a bit wide - eyed			2
i really look up to them , but there is a difference between idolising and respecting them			0
' sometimes i think the juniors can go into their first major event and they idolise too many of these people			0
you have to have respect for your competitors but you have to realise that , when you are on the line with them , you are going to race			0
' you will run the same distance as them			0
you have to get to the end very quickly and hopefully quicker than them			0
you have to normalise them a bit and do n’t tense up or start panicking			0
when that does happen , you shut down and you come last			0
' that changes of that happening to @entity22 , you imagine , are very slim indeed .			1

@entity22 won the 100m at the @entity146 last month
18 - year - old is set to compete at the @entity6 on thursday
and she will find out her a-level results before competing in the 200m
