by @entity0 this stunning panorama unveils a tapestry of stellar births and deaths spread across 50,000 light years			1
the dramatic scene was captured by the @entity7 telescope and reveals more details about our mysterious nearby spiral galaxy @entity11 ( @entity11 )			1
while astronomers are poring over its features , @entity12 has also enlisted the help of the public to understand exactly what they are seeing			0
although it looks sprawling , @entity11 is just under half of the size of the @entity32			0
this galaxy is dramatic and unusual ; it has hosted a large number of supernova explosions , and is thought to have a double nucleus lurking at its core			0
the stunning image is being used to support a citizen science project dubbed ' @entity40 : @entity11 ' which is enlisting public help to estimate ages for approximately 3000 star clusters			1
this is a @entity46 ( @entity45 ) image of the area around @entity11			2
located some 15 million light - years away in the constellation of @entity28 , it is one of the most visible galaxies of its type in our skies located some 15 million light - years away in the constellation of @entity28 , it is one of the most visible galaxies of its type in our skies			1
@entity11 's centre is mysterious and unusual ; the supermassive black hole at its heart is not alone			2
this striking spiral displays a phenomenon known as a double nucleus - a feature that has also been spotted in the @entity67 , the nearest spiral galaxy to us			0
this does not mean that @entity11 contains two central black holes , but that its single supermassive black hole may be ringed by a lopsided disc of stars			0
as well as this double nucleus , @entity74 83 has hosted six supernova explosions			0
this number is matched by only two other galaxies : @entity74 61 ( potw1324a ) which also has six , and @entity80 ( opo9910e ) , which tops the list with nine			0
amateur scientists will use the presence or absence of the pink hydrogen emission , the sharpness of the individual stars , and the colour of the clusters to estimate ages			1
for instance , the newest generations of stars are forming largely in clusters on the edges of the dark spiral dust lanes			0
these brilliant young stellar groupings , only a few million years old , produce huge amounts of ultraviolet light that is absorbed by surrounding diffuse gas clouds , causing them to glow in pinkish hydrogen light			2
gradually , the fierce stellar winds from the youngest , most massive stars blow away the gas , revealing bright blue star clusters and giving a ‘ @entity109 ’ appearance to the spiral arms			1
these youngest star clusters are about 1 million to 10 million years old			1
the populations of stars up to 100 million years or older appear yellow or orange by comparison because the young blue stars have already burned out			0
interstellar ‘ bubbles ’ produced by nearly 300 supernovas from massive stars have also been found in this @entity7 image			1
by studying these supernova remnants , astronomers can better understand the nature of the stars that exploded and dispersed nuclear processed chemical elements back into the galaxy , contributing to the next generation of new stars			0
people interested in exploring this remarkable image , and in directly participating in a science project , can visit the project page for more details			1
this view of @entity11 shows new @entity7 data combined with ground - based data from the @entity137 , which shows a wider field of view so the whole galaxy is visible			2

also known as @entity11 , the mysterious galaxy lies 15 million light years away
@entity7 image reveals stellar births and deaths across 50,000 light years
image is being used in a citizen science project dubbed @entity40 : @entity11
aim is for the public to estimate ages for approximately 3000 star clusters
