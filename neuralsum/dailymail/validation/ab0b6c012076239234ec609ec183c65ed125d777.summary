gradually , @entity4 asserted themselves and @entity26 , who trained with the first team the other day , was inches away from turning home a low @entity46 cross			0
@entity46 , the @entity29 prodigy currently out on loan at @entity48 , was denied by @entity10 shortly afterwards having been slipped clear by @entity26			0
the pressure was relentless and @entity35 , keen to make a positive impression , curled an effort just wide of the post after @entity54 man @entity53 and @entity0 combined to tee him up			0
@entity27 forward @entity26 featured for @entity4 in their win at @entity6 the busy @entity10 was again tested in the dying seconds of the half , tipping @entity46 's header over the crossbar following more good build - up work from @entity0 and @entity31 defender @entity60			1
after @entity0 finally made the breakthrough , @entity4 were able to relax a little but they continued to create chances at regular intervals			2
@entity46 fired over the bar after more good work from the lively @entity0 and @entity10 was called upon to deny @entity26 , who made his @entity27 first - team debut earlier this season			0
@entity0 could have added a second after finding himself in an identical situation to his goal but on this occasion the goalkeeper saved			2
@entity73 , who has featured in @entity27 's run to the @entity76 final , came on for @entity26 and nearly claimed his first @entity4 goal late on , only to fire inches wide			0
