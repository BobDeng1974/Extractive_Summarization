up until a few years ago , @entity4 had been the big bully on the block , pulling shoppers away from small electronics stores with its massive offerings			0
now , in the age of the @entity191 , those offerings look paltry			0
in response , @entity4 has been trying to revamp its business			0

once the bread - and - butter of electronics retailers , sales of @entity249 , digital cameras and video game consoles have weakened			1
meanwhile , sales of lower margin items like tablet computers , smartphones and e-readers have increased			0

adding to that , @entity4 , like other big - box retailers , is finding that those hulking stores are no longer attractive to consumers looking for one - stop shopping			1

it did that by either subletting the space to other merchants or giving it back to the landlords			0

and , they say , @entity4 should close even more stores and take advantage of its fast - growing mobile business			1
