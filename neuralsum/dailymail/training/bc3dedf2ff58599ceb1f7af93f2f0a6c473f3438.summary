by @entity0 published : 06:27 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 12:09 est , 20 august 2013 @entity2 passengers bedding down in this sleeper carriage will have made little progress with their journey by the time they wake			0
having once ferried travellers around @entity10 's rail network , the 1957 carriage has been lovingly converted into self - catering - and stationary - holiday accommodation for train spotters			0
the business is the brainchild of @entity16 couple @entity15 and @entity17 , who bought their first carriage for £ 170 17 years ago after unearthing an old railway siding in their garden			1
the @entity37 discovered the hidden siding after they bought a derelict rail station in the picturesque village of @entity41 and set about turning it into a family home			1
' it was the only property we could afford in the area at the time , ' said mrs @entity48 , a musician , who added that she and her husband decided to put a rail carriage on the siding and turn it into a bedroom where visiting friends could spend the night			1
the @entity37 began renting out the accommodation in an effort to recoup some of the £ 12,000 they spent restoring it , and the carriage proved so popular it spawned a thriving family business			1
the ultimate sleeper carriage : rail enthusiasts can spend the night in a vintage train carriage that has been lovingly converted into a hotel room quirky : snapped up on @entity36 , the railway carriages now feature double beds and self - catering facilities today along with the original room - which the family christened the @entity70 , guests can stay in a former travelling post office which once broke the 100mph speed barrier , or even - when restoration work on the @entity37 ' latest purchase is complete - a slip coach saloon created for @entity78 @entity77 's @entity76			2
mrs @entity48 said the carriages were originally aimed at railway enthusiasts who liked to stay in the offbeat accommodation while train - spotting in @entity16			1
but it has gone on to attract families , couples enjoying romantic breaks , and holidaymakers eager to experience something a little different			0
' we did some fairly heavy conversion work on our house , which was an old train station and was completely derelict , ' said mrs @entity48			1
' then we started scraping away the garden and found what turned out to be a railway siding			2
we thought how nice it would be to have a railway carriage on it , ' she added			0
@entity97 : the couple started renting out one of the carriages to make the conversion cost - effective - and have since expanded the project into a business conversion : @entity15 and @entity17 spent around £ 45,000 converting each of the five vintage carriages views of the countryside : a living room inside one of the railway carriages in @entity16 they began letting the @entity70 in 1996 when mrs @entity48 was pregnant with the couple 's first child , @entity112 , now 14			1
from there they built up a family business that looks set to keep right on growing			0
' we now have four carriages in total to let , three in @entity41 and one in @entity118 , ' said mrs @entity48 , who also has an 11 - year - old daughter , @entity122			0
' and we have five more in the works - but we 're taking our time and doing things very slowly			0
' the @entity37 are planning to turn one of their new carriages into entirely wheelchair - friendly accommodation , and another into a games room			0
a piece of railway history : this carriage , part of a former @entity135 train , once broke the 100mph speed barrier cosy : the @entity138 say the accommodation proves popular right through the winter months - so much so that they added a wood - burning stove in one of the carriages train - spotters paradise : the self - catering holiday lets are popular with railway enthusiasts who travel to @entity16 on train spotting breaks			2
