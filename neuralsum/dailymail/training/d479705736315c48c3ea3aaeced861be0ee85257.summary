but she was sentenced to four months imprisonment , suspended for two years , today and disqualified from driving for five years			2
@entity26 district judge @entity25 said : ' someone who is this many times over the legal limit is just about as dangerous as anybody on the road			1
i ca n't think of a case that ticks as many aggravating boxes			0
' described as ' one of the most respected and experienced stylists working in the industry today ' @entity2 specialises in film and tv shoots ; photo shoots , award ceremonies , including the @entity42 , and is also a style consultant and interior designer			2

she also admitted driving in @entity51 , north @entity8 on october 20 with 141 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath			1
@entity54 , defending , said : ' she is on the surface a woman , who two years ago , was apparently a busy working single - mother			2
that was a social facade and hidden from virtually everybody , under the ice , there was a slow decline of physical and mental health			1
' the court heard @entity2 was involved in a collision in @entity64 in the @entity65 before driving off and being pulled over in @entity48 in the first incident			1

' social services will take over if there is an immediate custodial sentence and the house she is renting for the children will go			0

' district judge @entity25 told a tearful @entity136 : ' there is an issue regarding your thought process around vehicles when you have had alcohol			2
' if you get into a car this much over the limit that car becomes a lethal weapon and to compound it there was a road traffic accident			0
you could have killed someone			0
' within five days you were back in the car over the limit and placed yourself and other road users in great peril			0
these readings are up there with the highest this court has ever heard of			0
' it 's a difficult case to sentence			0
the easiest thing in the world would be to send you to prison , but i have considered carefully the effect your behaviour has had on the children			2
' the loss of their mother to custody and then being taken into care would be devastating and they are at an age where they may never recover from it			0

@entity2 once counted @entity18 and @entity21 among her clients
but court hears she suffered a ' slow decline ' after collapse of marriages
she admitted twice driving in @entity8 at four times the drink - drive limit
@entity26 told on both occasion she drove off after collisions with other cars
judge says hers is one of the worst cases of drink - driving he 's ever seen
but he *agrees* to suspend her prison term for the sake of her two children
