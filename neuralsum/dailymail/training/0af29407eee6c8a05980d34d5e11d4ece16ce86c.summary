@entity1 manager @entity0 has hinted for the first time that he is keen to bring @entity4 midfielder @entity3 to the club			1
@entity4 coach @entity6 – who faces @entity7 and @entity1 here in @entity9 this afternoon – said on friday that the @entity11 international would not be leaving @entity12			1
however , @entity7 said at his press conference on saturday morning that he will wait for @entity3 to recover from ligament surgery before deciding whether to make a bid			1
it is my vision that we talk about a team and not individual players			2
' but @entity3 i can judge			1
he is injured for more than six months			1
we have to wait and see how he comes back			2
it is not easy to say how he comes back from injury , but we will wait and see			1
' @entity7 conducted an open training session at @entity36 ’ @entity37 on saturday			1
this time there were none of the histrionics that were a feature of training in @entity43 earlier in the week but the 62 - year - old ’s hands - on approach was once again clear			2
one thing that was noticeable was that @entity7 an all his staff wore identical old - fashioned black football boots , in stark contrast to the multi-coloured footwear sported by the @entity1 players			1
making his point : @entity0 talks to goalkeeper @entity55 as the rest of @entity1 's players watch on @entity59 way to do it : @entity0 instructs midfielder @entity60 as @entity1 train in @entity62 no let up : @entity0 makes his feelings known to @entity64 ( centre ) during @entity1 training all smiles : @entity0 beams as he addresses @entity1 's players during a open training session during a session that lasted more than an hour , the @entity1 manager concentrated on set - pieces and shooting practice			1
afterwards , @entity7 claimed his major mission at @entity74 was to train his players ’ minds rather than their bodies but dismissed suggestions it would be tough to introduce a more technical style of football to the club ’s @entity83 players			2
he said : ' the important thing is that i am training the players not in the legs , but in their brain			0
i say things how they are , it is my direct character			0
but they can do it			0
' at @entity99 they had always played 4 - 4 - 2 and i introduced the system they are playing now and it was a different thing for the players			0
talking tactics : @entity0 and his assistant manager @entity106 have a chat during a break in training men in black : @entity7 ( right ) and his staff all wore identical black football boots during training ' here , they are willing to pick up all the information that we show and say and that is very important			2
they want to perform our philosophy , but we have to wait and see how it develops			0
' i see progression every day , but also not always good things			0
we are here to improve , though			0
my philosophy is always there			0
' you must take into account the quality of the opponent and give team a structure to cope			0
off the pitch also there are many rules the players must fulfil for me			0
