sharks and crocodiles are predators in their own right , but who would win a fight if the two creatures came up against each other ? the answer is a crocodile - at least if this photo is anything to go by			1
@entity12 , 43 , managed to capture the moment this 5.5 metre crocodile named @entity15 latched onto a bull shark in the @entity17 before it swam off into the mangroves to devour its prey			1
' the tour guide had @entity15 jumping at some meat the first time we went past him			0
@entity15 is quite well known up here â€¦ he jumps really high for an old crocodile , ' he told @entity47			2
' we were near the end of the tour and we 'd fed all of the crocodiles along the river			0
we were on our way back to the jetty when we saw ( the crocodile ) had something in his mouth			0
' the tour guide , @entity60 from @entity61 , backed the boat back just as @entity15 the crocodile was on the river bank with the shark in its mouth			1
' the shark was definitely alive ... it was still wriggling			0
the crocodile slid back into the water and the shark started to flip around a bit			2
the the crocodile swam into the mangroves , i guess to protect his catch , ' mr @entity12 said			1
' i never even thought about a crocodile catching a shark before			2
it was absolutely amazing to see			0
i was amazed i even caught it on camera			0
' mr @entity12 , who lives in @entity30 , is four months into a year long trip around @entity32 with his partner and daughter			1
' there 's some amazing sites to see up here			0
to see the jumping crocodiles was pretty amazing but then to see this ... i think it will be pretty hard to top , ' he said			0
they have already travelled through @entity90 and are now part way through the @entity17 , before they head down into @entity32			2
@entity15 the killer crocodile is believed to be around 80 years old - and has a front leg missing which he is believed to have lost during a fight with a shark			1
he said despite the great sites left to see , it would be difficult to top the crocodile - shark - eating ordeal			1
