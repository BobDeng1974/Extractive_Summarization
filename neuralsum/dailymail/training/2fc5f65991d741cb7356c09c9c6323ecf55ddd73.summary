@entity9 , 31 , left , and brother @entity8 were jailed for 18 months each after cheating the taxman out of £ 350,000			1

judge @entity48 , sentencing at @entity50 , told the pair : ‘ there was a private company which was a family company and that company was eventually run by you with you effectively being the two owners of any shares			2
‘ rather than the company declaring to @entity34 for its full workforce of some thirty people and all its deductions for its employees , it transferred the employees to buffer companies			1
‘ in other words a company set up for the purpose of this manoeuvre			0
‘ although you were not directors of these companies you did control them and the idea was that the employees , rather than being employed by @entity21 , instead were employed by the buffer company			2

‘ i would submit their lifestyle was improved rather than lavish			0
‘ a large sum of money was used to entertain clients to keep business not because of any selfish reason to spend it at expensive places			0
