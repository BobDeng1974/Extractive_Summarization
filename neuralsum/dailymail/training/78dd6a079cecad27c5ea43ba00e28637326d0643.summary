it 's breakfast time in @entity1 and @entity2 and his buddies are chatting over eggs - over - easy and mugs of coffee			2
dressed in patched jackets and well - worn cowboy boots , and their faces flushed from the snow - storm outside , they could be mistaken for poor farmers who once eked out a living in this remote corner of @entity15			1
until you hear their topics of conversations			2
it is not about the crops of wheat or barley they once tended but racehorses , second homes in the sun , the latest cruises they have been on and , most importantly , the size of their most recent cheques			2
@entity2 and his friends are all newly minted millionaires , a modern breed of oil baron made rich almost overnight by a ‘ fracking boom ’ that has turned @entity15 into @entity38 ’s second - biggest oil producer			1
the @entity39 is enjoying a new black gold rush thanks to the method of extracting oil and natural gas from shale rock using a chemical and water mix. last week , a @entity39 government report announced that geologists believe the @entity49 , a geological formation covering 1,750 square miles south of @entity51 , could hold more than 15 billion barrels of oil			1
fracking booms in @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 mean @entity39 oil production exceeds seven million barrels a day for the first time in 20 years			1
our reporter @entity60 in @entity62 , @entity15 , another town that has seen a fracking boom @entity38 is on track to be energy independent in five years and become ‘ @entity38 ’ – potentially overtaking @entity67 as the world ’s biggest oil producer within a decade			1
@entity15 , which lies above the @entity70 – 200,000 square miles containing vast oil deposits only recently accessible thanks to fracking – has been dubbed ‘ @entity76 on the prairie ’ by locals still pinching themselves at their good fortune			1
twelve new millionaires are being created each week thanks to companies leasing mineral rights beneath land often held by farming families for generations			1
the towns of @entity85 ( pop 14,716 ) and @entity62 ( pop 4,000 ) , 75 miles away , are at the epicentre of the @entity70 boom			1
plunging temperatures and heavy snow failed to dampen the sense of excitement in the air in @entity62 last week			2
i watched as truck after truck thundered by on @entity96			2
in one direction they head to the oil fields loaded with water , chemicals , sand and supplies			1
in the other , giant tankers return filled with crude			2
fracking started here five years ago but it has only been in the past 18 months that locals say it has ‘ gone mad ’			1
fracking in @entity15 has injected millions of ponds into the local economy as oil companies lease mineral rights owned by local farmers @entity2 , 68 , takes me for a drive in his new truck			1
he recently purchased a horse farm in @entity117 ( ‘ where me and the wife plan to spend the winter ’ ) , went on an @entity119 cruise , has invested in an apartment block and , two weeks ago , bought his first racehorse			1
‘ nodding donkey ’ oil rigs stretch as far as the eye can see over flat prairies covered in snow			1
locals are not worried about environmental concerns which have dominated the fracking debate in the @entity133			2
oil deposits here are 20,000 - 30,000ft down			1
the water supply is at 1,000ft			0
@entity2 says : ‘ we love this land more than anyone			0
the oil companies work with us , they clean the fracking water before they take it away and there are safety inspectors crawling all over the rigs			1
‘ we have zero unemployment , the economy is booming and we are playing a massive part in making @entity38 energy independent			0
you wo n’t hear any moaning around here – well , maybe from those folk who do n’t own mineral rights			1
’ @entity2 refuses to say how much he has earned but admits to being a multi-millionaire			0
a typical well can earn $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 a month in royalties – about £ 33,000 to £ 66,000			0
state tax records for 2012 show 650 households in @entity62 declared ‘ new income ’ over a million dollars			0
all @entity163 ’s friends are millionaires several times over – one rancher receiving an eye - popping $ 1 million cheque last month			2
‘ he owns a massive amount of land , ’ says @entity2			0
‘ but that was a record even around here			0
the problem now is investing the money			0
it ’s like winning the lottery every month			0
‘ and as they drill more wells , my cheques get bigger			0
i ’m buying property and setting up trusts for my kids and grandkids			0
’ there are currently 9,000 oil - producing wells across @entity15 , with 2,300 more coming on stream this year			1
experts say the @entity70 rigs should produce oil for the next 50 years , and @entity62 ’s population is expected to double over the next 18 months			2
the @entity190 bar is buzzing at 3pm on friday			0
@entity191 , 45 , tells me he works five 14 - hour days followed by five days off , and earned $ 100,000 last year			0
‘ the company gives me free accommodation			0
it ’s tough work and there are no women but the money ’s good			0
there ’s nothing else to do except drink			0
but i ’m not complaining			0
i ’m working hard , making money and helping my country			0
it ’s the @entity39 dream			1

@entity85 , @entity15 , is one of the fracking *capitals* of the @entity39
