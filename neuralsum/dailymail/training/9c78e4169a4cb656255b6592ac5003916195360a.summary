at first glance this picture shows a typical scene from the plains of the @entity4 in @entity5 as some @entity7 's gazelles stand in front of the beautiful backdrop			0
but look again and you notice there is a certain nervousness about them and with good reason			0
if you look really hard you can see a well - camouflaged cheetah stalking them from behind			1
mr @entity32 , 32 , from @entity34 , said : ' the cheetah stopped in its tracks and looked intently into the distance			1
' experience had taught us what this meant			0
it had spotted some potentially vulnerable prey , gazelles in some longer grass than they ought to be			0
' although cheetahs have amazing acceleration , gazelles can run for longer so if the cheetah ca n't get close before it charges it can be outrun			1
the cheetah 's tail sticks out from the plains of the @entity4 in @entity5 after stalking its way up to gazelles and pouncing the cheetah appears from the plains and gives chase after the gazelles			2
photographer @entity32 took this action shot of the case the amazing shot of the camouflaged big cat and subsequent chase was taken by wildlife photographer @entity32 who was tracking the predator for a few days ' luckily , the gazelles had wandered into some long grass so it took about five minutes to stalk its way up to them before pouncing			1
' however , after the successful hunt and less than an hour 's eating , the cheetah was chased away from its kill by a hyaena			2
mr @entity32 , who takes photography workshops to the @entity4 , added : ' we had seen it stalk and hunt unsuccessfully a couple of times , but this time it killed one of the gazelles			2
' @entity82 often have to eat as quickly after a kill as they can as you can see , once word gets around there is a kill , something stronger turns up - in this case a hyaena			0
did you spot it ? if you look closely a well - camouflaged cheetah stands behind the gazelles staking them out before it pounces after the successful hunt and less than an hour 's eating , the cheetah was chased away from its kill by a hyaena ' in fact cheetahs are actually quite weak and even a few vultures are normally enough to drive it from its kill			2
' this is why it dragged the carcass into longer grass before eating			0
' the cheetah is the fastest land animal on the planet being able to accelerate from 0 to 62mph ( 100km/h ) in just three seconds			1
they seek him here , they seek him there ... the snow leopards are slightly smaller than the other big cats			0

yesterday photographs of wild snow leopards revealed just why the elusive animal is so hard to spot			0
pictured strolling across the face of a mountain , the endangered big cat is barely visible against a background of rock and shale			1
experienced wildlife photographer @entity124 , 41 , braved temperatures of over minus 20 degrees centigrade in an effort to get a glimpse of the creature .			1
