by @entity0 @entity1 has provided a tantalising glimpse into the incredible radar imagery it will provide from its 435 mile perch above the @entity5			1
the satellite , launched earlier this month , is on an ambitious mission to provide data for @entity11 ’s @entity10 environmental monitoring programme			1
rather aptly , its first image is a stunning mosaic of @entity15 in @entity16 - the seat of the @entity18 who are leading the mission			1
taken on 12 april 2014 , just nine days after launch , this first image from @entity21 captures @entity15 and surrounds in @entity16			1
the image also shows a more detailed view of the city in the ' zoom in '			2
@entity28 harbour is visible in the top left			2
the green colours correspond to vegetation , red - blue to urban areas , white to high - density urban areas and black to waterways and low - reflective areas such as airport runways it clearly captures the dense urban environment of @entity15 shown in white in the middle of the picture			1
@entity28 can be seen in the top left in red – blue colours and the greens depict vegetation in the surrounding areas			1
waterways and low - reflective areas such as airport runways appear black			0
among other applications , images such as this will be used for urban planning , for monitoring agriculture and for managing water resources			1
this first set of images also includes an area in @entity58 that is currently flooded by the @entity59			1
an area over the northern part of the @entity62			0
the image was taken using radar which works by sending out radio waves and timing how long it takes for them to reflect back			0
the colours indicate how the land , ice and water reflect the radar signal differently this image covers parts of @entity75 and @entity76 in @entity77			2
with @entity75 in a state of irreversible retreat , @entity78 is set to be an vital tool for monitoring such glaciers as well as for providing timely information on many other aspects of the polar regions , such as sea ice and icebergs launch : 3 april 2014 at @entity89 , @entity90 life : minimum of seven years mass : 2300 kg ( 5070 lbs ) instrument : c - band synthetic aperture radar dimensions : 9.2ft ( 2.8m ) long , 8.2ft ( 2.5m ) wide , 13ft ( 4m ) high mission : monitoring sea ice , oil spills , winds and waves , land - use change and to respond to emergencies such as floods and earthquakes @entity21 ’s ability to ‘ see ’ through cloud and rain and in pitch darkness make it particularly useful for monitoring floods and for offering images for emergency response			1
this is because it uses radar which works by sending out radio waves and timing how long it takes for them to reflect back			0
radio waves travel through air virtually unimpeded , but materials like metal , rock and water act almost as mirrors which can help reveal those areas inundated by floods			0
it also makes no different to radar if the @entity5 is in darkness			0
in fact , the @entity130 plain was shrouded in thick cloud when the satellite acquired the image on 13 april			1
one of the images acquired on the same day focuses on @entity75 in @entity77			0
this glacier is in a state of ‘ irreversible retreat ’ so it is important to keep a very close eye on glaciers such as these as they lose ice to the ocean			0
another image reveals a section over the northern part of the @entity62			0
the colours indicate how the land , ice and water reflect the radar signal differently			0
as well as monitoring glaciers , @entity21 is poised to generate timely maps of sea - ice conditions , particularly for the increasingly busy @entity157 waters			0
this image reveals the extent of flooding in the @entity130 plain from the @entity59 in @entity58			1
@entity162 is also featured in the image , further east along the @entity59			2
the image was downloaded two hours after data was received and the resulting products were available in less than an hour since it was launched from @entity168 in @entity90 , @entity21 has undertaken a complicated routine to deploy its 39ft ( 12m ) long radar and two 32 ft ( 10m ) long solar wings ( pictured ) , as well as passing a series of initial instrument checks images from its advanced radar can be used to distinguish clearly between the thinner more navigable first - year ice and the hazardous , much thicker multiyear ice to help assure safe year - round navigation in polar waters			1
since it was launched from @entity11 ’s @entity168 in @entity90 , @entity21 has undertaken a complicated routine to deploy its 39ft ( 12m ) long radar and two 32 ft ( 10m ) long solar wings , as well as passing a series of initial instrument checks			0
engineers still need to refine @entity1 's 435 mile ( 700km ) high orbit by firing the spacecraft ’s thruster			0
the director of @entity189 ’s @entity188 , @entity190 , said : ‘ we are exceptionally happy with this first set of images			0
‘ we are in very early days of the satellite ’s life in orbit and ground segment operations , but these images certainly demonstrate the calibre of data this advanced radar mission will bring from its different imaging modes , and how it will provide essential data for @entity10 services to benefit us all			1
’ @entity21 ( pictured here at launch ) is the first satellite built for the @entity10 environmental monitoring programme			2
it willl be used to monitor many aspects of the @entity5 's environment , from detecting and tracking oil spills to mapping sea ice and monitoring movement in land surfaces			2

the satellite , launched earlier this month , is on an ambitious mission to provide environmental data on the @entity5
its first image is a stunning mosaic of @entity15 in @entity16 with @entity28 seen in red and blue
another image shows the @entity130 plain in @entity58 , @entity226 , which is currently flooded by the @entity59 river
images such as this will be used for urban planning , monitoring agriculture and for managing water resources
