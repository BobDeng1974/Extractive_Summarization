stare closely at the pictures on this page			1
what do you think it took to create these beautiful images of @entity6 , @entity7 , princess @entity8 and @entity9 ? an expensive camera , a precision lens , hours of trial and error from a skilled photographer ? well , the answer is none of the above			1
all of these extraordinarily detailed pictures are pencil drawings , created purely by hand — with no digital trickery — by @entity23 artist @entity22 , whose only tools are a set of pencils , a piece of paper and the occasional stick of charcoal ( though most of the pictures do n’t even require that )			1
yet no matter how closely one looks , there ’s not a pencil line in sight			2
instead of drinking and clubbing , @entity51 , now 27 , stayed at home in @entity55 , @entity56 , seeking solace in drawing			2
now it looks as if he ’s on his way to fame and fortune			2
today , an exhibition of his work opens at @entity56 ’s @entity66 — and already some of his portraits are changing hands for £ 10,000 apiece			1
this week , a portrait he drew of @entity72 is to be presented to the late monarch ’s widow , @entity73			2
anyone can commission a portrait , though he will charge anything from £ 800 to £ 3,000 for his work			1
he says he prefers to work from photographs rather than real life — partly because of the length of time he spends on each picture			1
so how does @entity22 create these incredible works of art ? ‘ before i start drawing , i spend a few hours — even a few days — analysing the face from every angle			1
i usually start with the eyes			2
from there , i make the whole shape of the face and i work in the detail			1
invincible : the @entity94 graduate is gaining increasing recognition with images including this one of pop star @entity97 each work takes the 27 - year - old up to 100 hours to complete , and he tries to inspire emotion in the viewer with vivid portraits			1
@entity102 , @entity103 and princess @entity8 beauty of life : mr @entity22 favours using a simple pencil because it is ' humble ' and allows a subject - such as @entity107 , pictured - to shine rated r : the @entity56 - based artist has now scooped national awards and is exhibiting across the country			1
@entity102 , @entity9 ‘ i draw in sections			2
i ’m right - handed so i work from left to right			1
after i ’ve finished the left eye , i work the nostrils , then the left side of the cheek , then the lips			1
i always work in that order			1
‘ i work for four hours in one go , take a half - hour break , work another four to five hours , then have another half - hour break			1
after that i ’ll work for as long as i can			1
sometimes i might work ten to 15 hours in one day			1
it takes me on average 80 to 100 hours to do a portrait			2
’ he says the importance of hard work was impressed upon him , his brother and two sisters by their parents			1
his father , who now works in the oil industry , was originally a warden looking after a council estate ; his mother stayed at home to bring up the children			2
for this is a story not just about an incredible craftsman but of the triumph of the human spirit , the value of faith and a strong , loving family			1
my parents came to this country from @entity145 so that their children could have a better life			2
they instilled the message that hard work pays off			1
’ education mattered , too			2
his parents , practising @entity151 , fought for him to attend @entity154 , a prestigious @entity155 school in @entity156 , several miles away from their home — whose ex-pupils include @entity159 and @entity161 producer sir @entity160			2
@entity22 says : ‘ most teenagers experiment a lot with their life			1
’ he means drink and drugs			2
‘ i did n’t have that			2
but , to be honest , i did n’t want it anyway			2
i was too busy trying to focus on my craft			0
’ @entity22 , who had gained nine gcses , went on to study art at @entity94			1
it was here he found his true vocation			0
‘ when i draw , i ’m doing something i love			0
i lose myself in my art. @entity176 does n’t matter to me			0
’ incredibly , he was so absorbed in his work he was at first oblivious to the riots which were raging through his neighbourhood during summer 2011			1
‘ i was drawing at the time			0
my house is a minute away from where it was happening			0
i heard helicopters and i thought : “ what ’s going on ? ” then i went outside and saw people running around , and i started getting phone calls asking : “ @entity22 , are you ok ? there ’s a riot in @entity55			1
” it was a big shock to me			0
’ @entity22 believes he might never have become an artist had he not needed to look for a distraction			1
for his upbringing was far from privileged — not that he is the sort of person to complain about life			0
he grew up in one of the country ’s poorest areas , where he still lives with his family			0
as an 11 - year - old , he returned home with his family from an extended holiday to find their house had been repossessed			0
‘ it was just before i started secondary school and my life changed completely			0
we were homeless — not living on the street but we did n’t have a house for ourselves for the next three years			0
we moved from place to place , from cousin to cousin			0
’ he lived in five different homes over the course of just a few years — before eventually moving into a council flat , where the family remain today			0
why did the family lose the house ? ‘ i never knew			0
i just came back from @entity145 and found we were n’t living in that house any more			0
i ’ve never really wanted to press my parents on the subject			0
i just accepted what had happened and moved on			0
‘ it was a struggle			0
that ’s why i spent a lot of time by myself , drawing			0
i did n’t have the luxury of going out and spending money			0
’ today , his greatest pleasure is the pride he knows his success gives his parents			0
the other day , his local tv news carried a short item about him			0
‘ i do n’t think i ’ve ever seen my dad cry before			0
but he cried when he saw me and my art on the @entity240			0
it makes me feel happy to know i am making my family proud			0
that means the most to me			0
it makes me want to work harder and do more			1
