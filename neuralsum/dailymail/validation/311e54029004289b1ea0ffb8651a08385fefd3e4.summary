@entity1 defender @entity0 has urged @entity2 not to play for @entity3 under 21s this summer			1
@entity2 is set for his first senior call - up later this month for the games against @entity6 and @entity7			1
but the plan then is for @entity2 to drop down back into the @entity9 for this summer ’s @entity10 in the @entity11			1
@entity2 is likely to be included in @entity14 @entity13 squad in the summer @entity0 ( right ) believes the striker should stay at home and instead prepare for next season @entity1 manager @entity18 has already warned the @entity19 he wants talks with the @entity19 before giving them his blessing to call - up @entity2 this summer			1
and @entity0 , who played in the tournament in 2007 , says the 21 - year - old , who has played 41 games already this season , should skip the tournament in preparation for next season			1
the @entity29 said : ‘ it ’s difficult for me to judge			1
of course @entity3 want him			2
he is a brilliant striker and he can be the main man , but i think he needs his rest for next season			1
@entity2 rounds @entity32 in the @entity34 goal to double @entity1 's lead on saturday the striker has been in terrific form and continued his goalscoring run with two goals at @entity39 ‘ it ’s his call and i know a player always wants to play but sometimes you have to be careful			1
it ’s a difficult one because last season i played with injuries , but sometimes you just ca n’t			2
you have to think about what ’s going to come			0
' it ’s his decision and it ’s a totally different situation from when i played in 2007			0
did that benefit my development as a player ? it ’s hard to tell			0
‘ i enjoyed playing for my country because i never played international football at youth level			0
‘ so that was my first tournament as a @entity56 player and i enjoyed it			0
it was in @entity57 and i played in @entity57 for @entity58 at the time , so for me it was brilliant			0
’ @entity59 is another player whose club are considering asking if the young player can be left out @entity59 has not played for the under - 21s since winning his solitary cap in a 6 - 0 win against @entity65 in 2013 in another blow for under 21 head coach @entity67 , @entity68 want @entity59 to be given a summer of rest and hope he will not be included in the squad			2
@entity59 has not played for the @entity9 since winning his solitary cap in a 6 - 0 win against @entity65 in august 2013 , as he has been a regular in @entity73 ’s senior squads since then			2
however , @entity59 is a player @entity67 would want to consider			0
@entity68 , however , are anxious about how @entity59 ’s form has fluctuated this season and would prefer the 21 - year - old to spend the close season recharging			1
@entity68 are anxious about how @entity59 ’s form has fluctuated this season and his injury record @entity59 suffered a significant setback at the start of this campaign by damaging his knee ligaments @entity59 went to the @entity84 last year and suffered a significant setback at the start of this campaign , when damaging his knee ligaments that led to him spending eight weeks on the sidelines			2
the explosive nature of @entity59 ’s game has been missing in recent months and the statistics he has been producing in games have not matched the levels of 12 months ago			0
that is why @entity68 believe @entity59 ’s development would be best served by him being given the opportunity to completely rest in june and july before returning refreshed for pre-season			0
@entity68 manager @entity97 and @entity67 have an excellent work relationship and it is expected they will speak in the coming weeks .			0

@entity2 is to lead @entity14 in the @entity10
