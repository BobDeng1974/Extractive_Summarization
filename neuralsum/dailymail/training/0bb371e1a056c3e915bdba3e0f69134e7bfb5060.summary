by @entity0 published : 09:26 est , 9 april 2013 updated : 03:23 est , 10 april 2013 a robot widely used in keyhole surgery is being investigated over concerns about its safety			1
the @entity6 , used to treat cancer and other prostate problems , has been credited with reducing the side - effects of surgery			1
but it is now being investigated over reports of problems , including several deaths that may be linked with it			1
there also have been several disturbing , freak incidents : a robotic hand that would n't let go of tissue grasped during surgery and a robotic arm hitting a patient in the face as she lay on the operating table			1
the widely - used @entity6 robot is under scrutiny by the @entity27 over reports of problems , including several deaths that may be linked with it the @entity6 has four spider ‑ like arms , controlled by the surgeon , which hold cutting instruments to make tiny incisions and remove the prostate or the cancerous part using images from the telescope to guide the surgeon			1
it also features a tiny telescope which is placed inside an incision in the patient ’s body			0
the telescope takes images from two points , which are relayed back to a console so the surgeon has a 3d image on - screen while he operates			0
previous evidence has shown that using these robots mean significantly less blood loss , reduced risk of blood transfusion and probably a shorter overall recovery time			1
for surgeons , who control the robot while sitting at a computer screen rather than standing over the patient , these operations can be less tiring - and robotic hands do n't shake			1
a 2002 study in the journal @entity64 found prostate cancer surgery done by @entity6 robots had better outcomes for continence and cancer control than keyhole approaches done by the human hand			2
the robot is also now used for heart bypass surgery , heart valve repair and hysterectomy			0
but an upcoming research paper suggests that problems linked with robotic surgery are underreported , with some @entity80 doctors saying there is not enough robust research showing that robotic surgery is at least as good or better than conventional surgeries			0
previous evidence has shown that using these robots , rather than surgeon 's hands , results in less blood loss , reduced risk of blood transfusion and a shorter overall recovery time there are also cases of ' catastrophic complications ' , said dr @entity95 , a @entity96 surgeon who co-authored the paper			1
' the rapid adoption of robotic surgery ... has been done by and large without the proper evaluation , ' he told @entity101			0
now the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) is looking into a spike in reported problems during robotic surgeries			2
earlier this year , the @entity27 began a survey of surgeons using the robotic system			1
the agency conducts such surveys of devices routinely , but @entity27 spokeswoman @entity111 told @entity101 that the reason for the most recent investigation ' is the increase in number of reports received ' about @entity6			1
however , she added that the increase may simply reflect more awareness among doctors and hospitals about the need to report problems			0
it may also reflect wider use			0
last year there were 367,000 robot surgeries in the @entity80 versus 114,000 in 2008 , according to @entity6 's maker , @entity127 of @entity128 , @entity129			2
a search for the company 's name in an @entity27 database of reported problems related to medical devices brings up 500 reports since january 1st , 2012			2
many of these are said to have come from @entity127			0
there 's also no proof any of the problems were caused by the robot , and many did n't injure patients			0
reports filed this year include a woman who died during a 2012 hysterectomy when the surgeon - controlled robot accidentally nicked a blood vessel , a @entity152 man who died in 2007 after spleen surgery and a robotic arm that would n't let go of tissue grasped during colorectal surgery			1
' we had to do a total system shutdown to get the grasper to open its jaws , ' said the report filed by the hospital			0
the report said the patient was not injured			0
complications can occur with any type of surgery , and so far it 's unclear if they are more common in robotic operations , but that 's part of what the @entity27 is trying to find out			2
@entity127 disputes there 's been a true increase in problems and says the rise reflects a change it made last year in the way it reports problems			0
the @entity6 system ' has an excellent safety record with over 1.5 million surgeries performed globally , and total adverse event rates have remained low and in line with historical trends , ' said company spokeswoman @entity185 .			2

the @entity6 robot is increasingly used by surgeons *due* to its accuracy
also credited with fewer side - effects and a *quicker* recovery time
@entity194 is now being investigated by the @entity27
comes after fears that deaths and freak incidents may be linked to its use
they include a robot hitting a patient and another grasping tissue *tightly*
