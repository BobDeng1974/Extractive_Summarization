i 've being saying it for months that @entity2 needs to be shown the exit door at @entity4			1
he was woeful against @entity5			1
as soon as a player starts to kick up it spreads through the dressing room and sours the squad			1
@entity11 has a lot to sort out			2
@entity27 is not a wide player , he does not have the pace and athleticism to play on the left or right wing for @entity4			1
@entity33 bombed him out of @entity34 because he ca n't run box - to - box			1
he needs to be playing in the middle of the pitch , in the same position as @entity39 , to be effective			2
the balance is not right and the chemistry is simply not there			2
they lack pace , they lack unity and they lack team spirit			2
@entity11 needs a top draw holding central midfield player and two new young , mobile centre backs			2
but first and foremost , top of his priorities , should be getting rid of @entity2			1
no wide boy : @entity27 does not have the pace or athleticism to play on the wing thrashed : @entity5 were dominant at @entity58 as @entity4 floundered at home again changes : @entity11 ' squad overhaul should start with getting rid of @entity20 thirteen years ago i was watching a game between @entity65 reserves and @entity67 reserves on a cold tuesday night			1
i spotted this skinny young boy , who looked like he was suffering from malnutrition , playing against some of @entity67 â€™s tough , big men from @entity72			2
the boy had a great left foot and was striding up and down the wing with confidence			2
going down : @entity77 dived trying to win a penalty for @entity79 against @entity80 on saturday it was clear that night that the kid was one to watch			1
i do not know him personally , but i admire all players who have come into football fighting their way through the lower tiers to get to the top			2
@entity77 has gone through clubs at the @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and the championship to get where he is now			1
demonstrating that you can make the big steps up with hard work and dedication should make him a role model to all young players it can take you an awful long time			1
not that type of player : @entity77 would not have deliberately spat at @entity103 now 28 years old , he 's been rejected , knocked back and kept going			1
he once had a medical at @entity105 and was told he had a dodgy eye			2
i do n't believe for one moment a player with his personalty and characteristics would deliberately spit at @entity103			1
he is a good @entity77			1
what a pleasure it was to be a guest of @entity115 at the @entity116 on @entity117 day			0
i was well looked after by @entity118 - believe it or not there is actually a bloke called @entity118 who owns the betting firm			0
when i met the producer @entity123 outside with my ticket , i thought he was having a laugh as we made our way through the crowds to the corporate boxes down near the finishing line			0
well looked after : @entity131 was at the @entity116 last week when we made our way up the steps to our box i noticed just to the right was the @entity135 and inside i could see @entity136 and @entity137			0
that 's the closest i 've come to the royal family since one of them shook my hand on the pitch at @entity144 before the game against @entity146 in the 1986 @entity148 final			1
you should 've seen the shocked look on my face			1
i was mixing with the top punters who were whispering into their mobile phones to get their bets on			0
royalty : @entity137 ( second left ) was also at the @entity116 i must say , i kept my betting slip secretly under wraps as my five pound win slips would 've probably been quite embarrassing to the big - hitting professionals there that day			1
i was getting tips left right and centre and , as always , every single one of them was straight from the horse 's mouth			0
my tip that afternoon on the @entity168 and @entity169 show was for an @entity171 victory against @entity34			0
when i said that @entity169 , a @entity34 season ticket holder wearing his wonderful tweed @entity116 suit , looked at me like i was mad			0
top tip : my tip for the @entity116 ... was for @entity171 to beat @entity34 but i knew there was a chance of a slip up , with the energy and athleticism of @entity183 's young team and the outstanding quality of @entity185 , coupled with a @entity187 game just a few days away for @entity34			0
@entity183 has never once criticised his players through some testing times this season and , mark my words , the players at @entity171 will be challenging next year towards the top end of the league , rather than worrying about the bottom			0
@entity196 has shown this season in the centre of @entity200 's defence that he has got b * * * s. well , after the weekend , he is certainly nursing them after a @entity204 player accidentally stepped on one of his testicles			0
it made me wince when i heard that it had swelled up			0
painful : @entity196 suffered a nasty injury in the win against @entity204 ... it reminds me of the second-most watched video clip in the @entity214 household - the one of @entity215 trying to clear the ball off the line against @entity34 with an amazing sliding clearance , only to miss the ball and be skewered by the post between his legs			0
it was in front of the live tv cameras and an @entity227 stadium packed to the rafters			0
it never fails to bring a tear to the eye			0
oh by the way , the most - watched video clip and voted unanimously as number one at my home was of the @entity237 supporters on @entity238 chanting ' @entity214 is a.			0
. ' repeatedly at me for 10 minutes			0
i ca n't possibly repeat what they said in this column			1
i was manager at @entity243 at the time			0
my sons thought it was amusing			0
quite often if i said they could n't go out , or that it was time for their bed or that they had to do their homework , they would put the @entity238 clip on inside the house at full volume !			1

@entity2 should leave @entity4
he was awful against @entity5 and is *disrupting* the dressing room
the @entity257 striker is not pulling his weight and clearly wants out
i do n't think @entity77 would 've deliberately spat at @entity103
