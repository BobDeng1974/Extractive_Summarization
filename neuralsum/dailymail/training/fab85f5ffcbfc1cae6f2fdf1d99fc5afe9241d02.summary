she lived with her adoptive parents @entity17 and @entity19 from then until 2011 , when @entity14 used his @entity21 roots to secure custody of the three - year - old			1
on monday , he filed court papers to formally adopt the child , a move that could likely complicate the custody dispute			1
attorneys for @entity29 and mrs @entity19 and for @entity16 's biological mother , @entity30 , said the action defies high court justices who asked @entity35 judges to determine where the girl should live			1

she said she would fight the termination of her parental rights if the planned adoption does n't go through			0
' we believe these frivolous filings in other jurisdictions are designed to further delay the proceedings in the hope that it will make it harder for @entity35 to finalize the ( @entity59 ' ) adoption , ' @entity43 told @entity60			2
@entity14 's @entity62 attorney @entity61 said her client simply wanted to continue raising his daughter			2

when @entity14 challenged the @entity59 ' adoption , his lawyers cited the @entity91 , a federal law that gives tribes and relatives a say in decisions affecting children with native american heritage			1
it was passed in 1978 because of the high number of @entity7 children being removed from their homes by public and private agencies			2
a @entity35 court favored his argument that federal law preferred the girl living with him and growing up learning tribal traditions and the child was handed over to him after a court battle in december 2011			1
' i 'm always going to be her daddy ' : @entity14 and daughter @entity16 met for the first time on @entity115 2011 the @entity116 ruled late last month that the law did n't apply to the dispute the way the @entity35 judge thought it did			1
the justices said @entity14 's parental rights could have been terminated because he never had custody of the girl and never supported her			2
the case was thrown back to the @entity35 supreme court with the order it be expedited so @entity16 's situation could be determined			1
@entity16 ' has been extremely well cared for and loved by her father and has thrived , ' the adoption papers state , according to the @entity60			2

but justices sided with @entity14 , saying in an emotional opinion that , while the @entity59 were ' ideal parents , ' federal law requires that custodial preference be given to the child 's @entity21 parent			1
meanwhile , @entity14 claims his daughter no longer even recognizes the family who raised her for the first two years of her life			2
she was handed over to him on @entity156 and he says the bonding process was instantaneous			0
@entity14 claims @entity16 had started to call him ' daddy ' within minutes of them meeting and a week after moving to his home in @entity160 , @entity13 , she had also started to call his wife @entity161 '			2

daddy : @entity14 says his daughter started to call him ' daddy ' within minutes of them meeting for the first time when she was two law : the @entity91 gives tribes and relatives a say in decisions affecting children with native american heritage state courts have been at odds on the law 's application			1
the group has filed a brief supporting the @entity59 ' case			0
it says the court previously has ruled on the rights of mothers and unwed fathers - rights that , a past president of the group said , federal law has n't defined , at least for @entity21 children			0
' those cases clearly state that unwed fathers do not have an automatic fully protected right to participate in decisions about the child , ' @entity224 adoption attorney @entity223 said earlier this years during a conference call with reporters			0
case law aside , @entity223 said , the emotional aspects of the case are hard to ignore			0
