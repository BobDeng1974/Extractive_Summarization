today it emerged that @entity16 director @entity15 has sent his $ 80million private jet to scour vast swathes of the area where it is believed the plane went down			2
search teams hampered by terrible weather conditions and little information are now battling against the clock as the batteries in the beacon have a 30 day life span			2
it is 26 days since the @entity30 disappeared en route from @entity32 to @entity33			2
@entity36 submarine @entity34 , which is said to have ' advanced underwater search capabilities ' , has arrived in the southern @entity4 to help in the search for the missing flight @entity7 @entity36 survey ship @entity40 is also helping to search for the missing @entity7 which disappeared on march 8			1
the extensive search area is currently focused off the coast of @entity44 there are currently seven countries assisting in the search including @entity48 , @entity44 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and the @entity53 with investigations being led by @entity51			1

‘ she was ordered to move from an operational tasking to the search area around a week ago and arrived on station yesterday ’ , an @entity55 source said			1
‘ @entity34 holds advanced search capabilities , but the task in hand remains a tall order and the search area is immense			1
her deployment is being co-ordinated closely with our @entity70 and @entity53 colleagues			2
’ the @entity36 vessel @entity40 is also part of the search , which is focussed on an area spanning 98,000 square miles ( 15,770km )			1

one of these is @entity15 ’s long - range business jet , a @entity82 which can carry eight passengers and a crew of four			2
it has a non-stop distance of 8,000miles ( 12,964km ) and is considered to be able to fly further and faster than some military aircraft			0

' a lot of civilian and military aircraft are involved in the search and it 's kind of disappointing that because one is owned by a celebrity it becomes a matter of news when there are [ over ] 200 people missing			2
' the jet , which sir @entity15 purchased last march , is primarily being used to help relay communications between other vessels involved in the search			1
the @entity3 submarine as well as an @entity70 ship the @entity92 are focusing on detecting pings emitted by @entity7 ’s locater , which is attached to the flight data recorder			1
it can be heard up to two nautical miles away but this is only in good conditions			0
the search for the aircraft will continue long after the batteries on the locater run out but tracking the signal is the most efficient way of finding a downed plane			0

the government had transcribed the final voice transmission received by ground controllers at @entity32 's international airport as ‘ all right , good night ’ , but last night it released a transcript of the conversation which noted the final words as : ‘ good night @entity51 three - seven - zero			0
’ @entity70 prime minister @entity168 said despite the search for the aircraft being slow , difficult and frustrating , it will continue indefinitely			2
he said the intensity and magnitude of operations ‘ is increasing , not decreasing ’ , and added : ‘ if this mystery is solvable , we will solve it			0
’ @entity178 ( @entity178 ) director general @entity177 said there is ‘ disbelief ’ that flight mh370 ‘ could simply disappear ’ and a plane must ‘ never again go missing in this way ’			1

we can not let another aircraft simply vanish			0

it may well be a long time before we know exactly what happened on that flight			0
