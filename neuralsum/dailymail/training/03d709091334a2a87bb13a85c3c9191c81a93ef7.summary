@entity1 chief executive @entity0 views @entity3 's performance since the @entity4 as unsatisfactory			1
an encouraging runners - up finish in the @entity6 was followed by a run of five consecutive defeats , three on the summer tour to @entity10 and autumn losses to the @entity10 and @entity12			1
victories over @entity14 and @entity15 rescued a measure of respectability from the @entity19 series with only eight matches left for head coach @entity21 to build a team capable of winning next year 's @entity23			1
@entity3 captain @entity24 looks dejected after the @entity19 international defeat by @entity12 @entity3 lost 31 - 28 to @entity12 in november in a close match at @entity27 @entity0 rejects the notion that @entity3 have stagnated this autumn and - while disappointed by the recent losses - he is convinced they will be ready for the global showpiece on home soil			1
' it 's been a very hard schedule - we 've played @entity10 four times on the bounce , ' @entity0 said			1
' i do n't make any apologies for that because we want to be playing the best in the world and judge ourselves against that			0
' we 've played four times against @entity10 and lost four			1
verdict : that 's not satisfactory and we want to do better than that			2
' absolutely this is n't a development phase			0
we need to be and have to be competitive and beat those teams			0
@entity0 ( right ) said @entity3 must do better after ' unsatisfactory ' results since @entity4 @entity3 were also beaten by @entity10 during the @entity52 internationals ' we need to be in a position of beating every team			1
that 's what we have to do			2
' but there is no doubt in my mind that the margin is pretty small			0
there 's no chasm of difference			2
' it 's very marginal and now it 's about making sure that margin is made up			0
that 's the view of the coaching team as well			0
' next year i undoubtedly think we 'll be stronger not weaker , whether that 's because of the time the squad have to train together or the availability of players			2
' it was @entity3 's fourth defeat by the @entity10 since june after losing all three games of a summer tour @entity0 still holds hope that the team will be stronger by the time the @entity81 comes around @entity3 have finished @entity4 runners - up for the last three years and @entity0 refused to be drawn on whether the @entity6 is a must - win tournament given the proximity of the @entity23			1
' every match is a must win			0
it 's a perfect start to the @entity4 , against @entity87 in @entity88 on a friday night , ' @entity0 said			1
' that 's a good game to kick off with in terms of must win			0
and then the third game is in @entity92			0
' we will lose games from time to time , that 's inevitable			2
but our confidence in the coaching team is such that we believe we will get it right			0

@entity3 have won twice since finishing runners - up in the @entity4
@entity21 's side have lost to @entity10 four times and were beaten by @entity12 in that time
@entity1 chief @entity0 said that return is not ' satisfactory ' and @entity3 ' must do better '
