by @entity0 a devastating ' impact winter ' , brought on by an asteroid strike 66 million years ago , is being blamed for wiping out the dinosaurs			1
researchers have discovered the first physical evidence that global temperatures suddenly plummeted following the impact off @entity9 's @entity8			1
its effects would have been identical to those seen in the aftermath of a large - scale nuclear war , including the chilling effect of dust blotting out of the sun. research suggests a devastating ' impact winter ' wiped out the dinosaurs after a six - mile - wide ( 10km ) asteroid slammed into the @entity22 66 million years ago			1
the study is the first to provide physical evidence for the sudden plunge in global temperatures that followed the impact off @entity9 's @entity8			1
illustration pictured computer simulations suggest a hellish environment in the first hours following the impact , marked by earthquakes , tsunamis and global wildfires sparked by an intense heat pulse			2
next , dust and sulphur droplets would have collected in the atmosphere and blocked out the sun 's rays			0
the effect may have been made worse by heat - absorbing soot from burning organic matter , said the researchers			2
the ' dark phase ' would have temporarily suppressed the photosynthesis of green plants and algae , causing a ' global collapse of terrestrial and marine food webs '			0
according to the models , the amount of sunlight reaching the @entity22 's surface might have been reduced to around 20 per cent of its normal level after the impact			1
according to the research , the ' @entity59 ' impact is likely to have brought about this ' nuclear winter ' by lowering global sea surface temperatures by as much as @entity63 ( 45 ° f ) at a conservative estimate			1
for creatures evolved to live in a lush , warm , green world , the result would have been catastrophic			0
the ' winter ' is thought to have lasted no more than two to three decades , but that was long enough to wipe out the dinosaurs , flying and swimming reptiles , and many other forms of life			1
only the most adaptable survived , leading to the reign of the birds and mammals that continues to this day			2
the evidence comes from the @entity78 region of @entity79 , where sedimentary rocks the same age as the asteroid impact contain layers of broken shells			1
they are thought to have been left there by a tsunami triggered when the massive space rock plunged into the ocean			0
unusually high concentrations of iridium produced as the asteroid vapourised were also found in the sediments			0
an idea of post-impact sea surface temperatures was obtained by analysing fatty molecules from marine organisms preserved in these rocks			0
according to the study , the ' @entity59 ' impact is likely to have lowered global sea surface temperatures by as much as @entity63 ( 45 ° f ) at a conservative estimate			1
for creatures evolved to live in a lush , warm , green world , the result would have been catastrophic these had a different signature before and after the event , also known as the @entity110 ( @entity111 ) boundary impact			2
they indicated a significant temperature drop compared with the period just before the asteroid struck , with some samples suggesting a fall of up to 7 ° @entity119 )			0
scientists recently reconstructed one of the biggest asteroid impacts ever to hit @entity22 - and claim it was six times as big as the blast than wiped out the dinosaurs			1
a huge asteroid is believed to have hit @entity22 3.26 billion years ago , creating unique geological features found in a @entity130 region known as the @entity132 greenstone belt			1
researcher said the impact would have boiled oceans , burned the sky , and cause the planet to shake for 30 minutes			0
the huge impactor - between 23 and 36 miles ( 37 and 58km ) wide - collided with the planet at 12 miles ( 20km ) per second			0
the jolt , bigger than a 10.8 magnitude earthquake , propelled seismic waves hundreds of kilometers through the @entity22 , breaking rocks and setting off other large earthquakes			2
tsunamis thousands of metres deep - far bigger than recent tsunamis generated by earthquakes - swept across the oceans that covered most of the @entity22 at that time			2
the scientists , led by dr @entity149 , from @entity150 in the @entity151 , wrote in the journal @entity152 : ' the global impact winter , characterised by darkness and a dramatic cooling of ocean surface waters , perturbed a relatively stable , warm , latest @entity159 climate and likely represented a major stress factor for life on @entity22			1
' computer simulations suggest a hellish environment in the first hours after the impact marked by earthquakes , tsunamis and global wildfires sparked by an intense heat pulse			0
next , dust and sulphur droplets would have collected in the atmosphere and blocked out the sun 's rays			0
the effect may have been made worse by heat - absorbing soot from burning organic matter , said the researchers			0
the ' dark phase ' would have temporarily suppressed the photosynthesis of green plants and algae , causing a ' global collapse of terrestrial and marine food webs '			0
according to the models , the amount of sunlight reaching the @entity22 's surface might have been reduced to around 20 % of its normal level after the impact			1
the contrast between still - warm oceans and cold air would have fuelled large storms and hurricanes , whipping up more dust and increasing the time it spent in the atmosphere			0
@entity202 life might also have been affected by the acidification of seawater caused by a fall - out of sulphurous particles raining down from the sky			0
the researchers concluded : ' the k - pg boundary impact presents a unique event in @entity22 history because it caused global change at an unparalleled rate			1
this detailed portrayal of the environmental consequences of the @entity111 impact and aftermath aids in our understanding of truly rapid climate change			2

study suggests a ' nuclear winter ' followed the dinosaur *extinction* event
researchers from @entity150 claim an asteroid impact altered @entity22
the effects would have been similar to the aftermath of a nuclear war
the amount of sunlight could have dropped to 20 % of its *current* level
this would have lasted decades and wiped out any life that survived the hit
