by @entity0 for the @entity1 a football team finds a level in the end			2
for this season , possibly beyond , @entity6 ’s level will be the @entity8			1
on this evidence , that may be no bad thing			2
@entity13 ’s team crafted a useful 1 - 1 draw in the away game in @entity16			1
but the solid foundations of the first leg collapsed in catastrophic fashion 15 minutes from time			1
make no mistake , there will be no @entity23 reprieve from this			1
subs not used : @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62			2
booked : commons , @entity48 , @entity46			2
@entity16 : @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 ( @entity69 82 ) , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity30 ( @entity74 90 )			1
subs not used : @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80			2
booked : @entity66 , @entity65 , @entity64 , @entity30			2
att : 58,000 ref : @entity82 ( @entity83 ) galling is the knowledge that , at 0 - 0 , @entity87 ’s champions were through			1
a scoreless draw would have been sufficient to secure a third successive season of @entity27 group - stage football			1
but this is an under - resourced @entity6 team with deep problems			1
the greatest of which is defending			2
evidence @entity49 , the fall guy of this debilitating defeat			2
the @entity98 left - back was once the next big thing			2
with @entity53 , he was the shining light in @entity6 ’s fabled transfer system			1
now he can do little right			2
he was guilty of the wretched piece of defending which allowed @entity16 ’s captain @entity30 to hook a deflected shot home in a crowded penalty area in 75 minutes , a defensive header landing his own team bang in trouble			1
from the moment the ball nestled in the net , @entity6 were effectively out			1
on a night of abject frustration and disjointed play , they rarely looked like scoring			1
in the third of four minutes of injury time they should , somehow , have salvaged extra-time when @entity119 — pushed up as an emergency centre - forward — blew a wonderful chance from eight yards			2
and yet , after two years of performing in the group stage and downsizing , @entity6 ’s chickens have come home to roost			1
striker @entity125 will sign for £ 2.4million in the next 24 hours			2
but like @entity128 and @entity129 , the @entity127 ’s arrival is too little , too late			2
at time up , @entity16 players and officials leapt and cavorted in disbelief on the pitch			1
they were an average team , but less average than @entity6			1
both they and @entity6 got what they deserved			1
so close : @entity6 's @entity50 ( left ) watches as his effort finds the crossbar stunned : @entity6 @entity139 ( left ) and @entity119 are dejected after the latter missed a late chance inevitably , there will be questions asked of @entity13 once more after this			1
his team were humiliated by @entity147 , advancing on a technicality at the say - so of @entity23 ’s disciplinary committee			2
they were n’t good enough then and to exit the competition twice in one season is grim stuff			0
there was a naivety to the way he chased victory here			0
in the end the decision to sacrifice three points in @entity161 on saturday proved hopelessly misjudged			0
in truth , no one expected what transpired here			0
@entity16 were dominated in @entity38 but turned the tables on a night when @entity13 ’s side flailed and thrashed around			1
@entity6 made only one change from the away leg , which finished 1 - 1 , @entity47 – in an eyebrow - raising move – replacing @entity61 in defence			1
yet they played at times as if they had been introduced 20 minutes before kick - off			0
a degree of credit for that should go to @entity16			1
passive at home , they were aggressive here , pressing higher up the field and more menacing in attack			0
for @entity6 , it started promisingly enough			1
after five minutes @entity55 danced to the byeline and squeezed the ball across goal , defender @entity66 slotting past his own post as @entity57 lurked with intent			0
a large crowd , close to capacity , settled in anticipation of a home victory			0
yet the passing of time brought unrest and concern rather than an opening goal			0
@entity16 came close twice in the 16th minute			1
@entity72 found too much space in the middle of the pitch and smashed a 25 - yard shot inches past @entity44 ’s post			0
tussle : @entity6 's @entity119 ( right ) tackles @entity73 as the @entity204 crash out talking to : the @entity16 fans are spoken to by police at @entity207 as their side angry : the fans clashed with police but they were left cheering as their side beat @entity6 in @entity211 within moments , @entity52 lost the ball in his own half , @entity30 almost creating a clear chance until @entity47 got across to snuff out the danger			1
at right - back , there seemed less prospect of @entity47 — an erratic defender at the best of times — doing any real damage			0
and yet @entity16 came closest of all in 33 minutes			1
a diagonal ball to @entity67 found @entity47 hopelessly out of position			0
as he charged across , the attacker cut inside to his right foot with ease and drove a low shot which @entity44 brilliantly saved , the ball rebounding off the chest of @entity30 and safely into the @entity87 keeper ’s hands			0
for @entity6 , it was a let - off			1
alarmingly , they were creating little or nothing at the other end			0
@entity50 was the liveliest player			1
yet it was hardly a crowded field			0
@entity57 was hopelessly isolated in attack and looks increasingly uncomfortable with the role @entity13 is asking him to play			1
even so , the @entity240 did craft a decent opening from a driven corner , @entity48 failing to find power or direction with his header			0
the concern of the home support was growing by half - time			0
@entity13 had repeatedly said he would rather his team lost than play bad football			2
there was a real danger here that they would exit the @entity27 doing both			1
for that reason , perhaps , the @entity256 brought @entity139 into the fray at half - time , withdrawing an ineffectual @entity53			0
left out of the starting line - ups home and away , last season ’s top scorer was a surprising omission			0
and yet this much was clearer			0
@entity57 — and @entity6 — needed help			1
and @entity13 was seeking it from a player he seems less than enamoured with			2
not happy : @entity6 fans protest after their side were knocked out of the @entity27 fuming : @entity6 have made a bad start to the season and must now play in the @entity8 the first thing @entity139 contributed was a yellow card			1
the second was a degree of urgency			0
with the crowd finally finding their voice , the home team gave them something to stir the senses when @entity50 struck the bar from 10 yards after a fine run from @entity57			0
@entity6 , suddenly , had a spring in their play			1
but few realised then that would be their best opening			0
with an away goal from the first game , they had no need to win			0
in that idealistic way of his , however , @entity13 was of no mind to take chances			0
it ’s hardly hindsight to say his team were almost too open , frantic even			0
commons came within inches of a spectacular opening goal in 65 minutes , collecting the ball 30 yards from goal			0
as it sat up , he had just one thought in mind , thumping a half volley inches over the bar			0
it was a fine effort			0
and yet , within seconds , @entity6 survived a major let - off			1
for the first time in the game , @entity16 slipped in behind the green and white defence , @entity68 ignoring options inside to thump an angled shot straight at @entity44 from 10 yards			1
the keeper pulled off a fine save , but for @entity6 it was a significant escape			1
their last of the night			0
@entity319 then limped off to make way for @entity46			2
when the @entity322 is the answer , it ’s clear something , somewhere is malfunctioning			0
it all told in the end			0
with the scrambled , looping goal from @entity30			0
with the last ditch misery for @entity48			0
with the disbelieving celebrations of the visitors			0
for @entity6 , the @entity8 is now their fate			1
truth be told , it ’s their level .			0

@entity6 fail to make @entity27 group stage
@entity43 side *reinstated* after previous *opponents* fielded *ineligible* player
hoops drew first leg in @entity16 but were beaten at @entity207
@entity43 champions will now play in the @entity8
