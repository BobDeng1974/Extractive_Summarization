' we know we have to work hard this season , probably harder than we have had to work before			0

' it is a great game for everybody , ' he said			0
all ears : @entity2 transmits his message to the @entity5 squad in a recent training session ' we are excited about the prospect of the new season and this is a great game to open the season with , so we look forward to it			1
