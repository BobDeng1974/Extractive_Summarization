he also scored in the @entity10 and the @entity12 finals in 2014			0
@entity0 ran onto an @entity14 pass six minutes into the second half and fired low under the diving body of @entity18 keeper @entity17 to double @entity3 ’s lead			1
@entity20 had crashed a header home in the first half from a @entity24 corner to put @entity3 in front			1
it was the same combination that got them to the @entity28 in the first place			2
in @entity32 last @entity31 ’ injury time header equalised the @entity10 final against @entity34 and @entity0 scored in extra-time to finally put @entity37 ’s side ahead			1

here they were in @entity106 rounding off what many have called @entity3 ’s best ever year – for the first time in their 112 - year history they have won four trophies in a calendar year			1
@entity39 , playing his 700th competitive game for the club , lifted the trophy			0
he has now won every major honour in club and international football			0
goal - hero @entity20 was voted man of the match but there were many candidates with his central defensive partner @entity63 also outstanding and @entity24 superb in midfield			2
it was his corner that @entity20 headed in on 37 minutes			1
@entity18 had taken the physical approach early on with @entity79 booked for flattening @entity0			1
the former @entity128 man was also wrestled to the ground from the previous corner			0
@entity18 finished up with just four bookings from lenient referee @entity103 but their strong - arm tactics were not enough to prevent @entity3 picking up their 22nd straight victory			1
@entity70 ’s shirt was ripped at the collar and almost pulled from his torso during the second half as he went for a @entity0 cross			2
for once both the @entity140 striker and @entity46 failed to find the net but @entity0 ’s second half strike made sure there was no way back for @entity18			1
@entity37 has now won more trophies in 16 months than @entity146 in three years			0
@entity148 coach @entity147 was , as ever , by his side , and there were a few special words for the @entity152 from club president @entity153 as he congratulated each @entity3 player and coaching - staff member as they received their medals			2
@entity46 appeared to snub @entity157 as he walked down the line of dignitaries			0
the @entity140 ’s recent comments that he believes a @entity162 player should win the @entity163 have evidently not gone down well with @entity3 ’s record - breaking forward			1
it remains to be seen if @entity46 is voted best individual player of 2014 at january ’s @entity163 gala but what is no longer in any doubt is that @entity3 are team of the year			2
' it ’s incredible , unforgettable ' beamed jubilant coach @entity37 on the final whistle			0
' we are delighted to end the year this way but we have to keep going because we know the season does not end here			0
we want 2015 to be like 2014			0
