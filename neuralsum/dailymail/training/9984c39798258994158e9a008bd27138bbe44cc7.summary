a cattle farmer claimed today that the badger cull had ended his bovine tuberculosis nightmare that lasted more than ten years			0
@entity3 - whose land in @entity5 , @entity6 , lies within the controversial pilot area - said his dairy herd was free of @entity9 for the first time since 2004			1
the 48 - year - old father - of - two claimed that this was because badgers carrying the disease had been killed in his area during culls over the past two years			1
but animal rights activists have disputed the claims made by @entity26 president @entity34 at the organisation ’s annual conference in @entity37 yesterday			1
and the badger issue looks set to become a major political issue , with environment secretary @entity40 telling farmers at the event that the @entity43 would extend the cull if re-elected			2
mr @entity34 urged politicians not to make the cull ' a party political issue ' in the run - up to the general election , and criticised @entity51 for pledging to give up on culling			0
moving forward : mr @entity3 said his 1,700 strong herd was given a negative test for @entity9 shortly after the second cull ended in november and the final all clear last friday big issue : environment secretary @entity40 ( left ) said at the @entity59 conference that the @entity43 would extend the cull if re-elected			1
@entity26 president @entity34 is also pictured ( right ) cattle : mr @entity3 ’s farm was one of those in the 132 sq mile @entity66 pilot badger cull , where disruption was blamed for only 274 badgers being killed yesterday mr @entity3 said his 1,700 strong herd was given a negative test for @entity9 shortly after the second cull ended in november and the final all - clear last friday			1
mr @entity3 said being branded a ‘ dirty herd ’ for 11 years had cost his family farm ‘ hundreds of thousands of pounds ’ - and placed his family and staff under huge strain			1
he added : ‘ i could hardly believe the results because i was starting to think we ’d never get out of it			0
after all those years of frustration i can finally see light at the end of the tunnel			0
‘ it ’s been a completely debilitating and disheartening experience that really grinds you down			0
because i ’ve been living under the shadow of @entity9 for so long now , i ’m not sure exactly what it will mean			2
i ’m still coming blinking into the bright daylight			0
’ demonstration : a file photograph of anti-badger cull activists mounting patrols during the controversial trial on patrol : campaigners believe the cull ' fails our wildlife by subjecting badgers to inhumane shooting ' and ' fails farmers by promising a solution to @entity9 that simply does n't work ' @entity104 : mr @entity3 said it was ' clear the reservoir of infection was outside the herd in the badger population ' mr @entity3 has had to manage the disease since taking over the family farm , which is in a @entity9 hotspot along the border between @entity6 and @entity114			1
ministers and farmers insist culling is vital to tackle @entity9 , which can be spread from badgers to livestock - with more than 26,000 cattle slaughtered in @entity120 last year and multimillion - pound losses			1
but opponents say badger - culling is inhumane and ineffective , and alternatives such as vaccination should be pursued			0
an independent expert panel found that controlled shooting of badgers in the cull 's first year was not effective or humane			2
in @entity6 just 274 badgers were culled in the second year of the pilot , falling far short of the minimum 615 estimated to be needed to deliver reductions in @entity9 in livestock , leading the chief vet to admit the benefits of the cull might not be realised there			1
the government claimed the low numbers in @entity6 reflected the ' challenges of extensive unlawful protest and intimidation ' by anti-cull campaigners			2
in @entity28 , the location of the other pilot cull , a sufficient number of badgers were killed this year to lead to expected reductions in @entity9 in cattle , with 341 culled , in a required range of 316 to 785			1
in both of the pilot areas , a significant proportion were killed by the more expensive cage trapping and shooting method - rather than ' controlled shooting ' of free - running badgers			2
he added : ‘ i do n’t know if we were the longest down , but at 11 years we must have been one of the longest			0
they tested every two months and every time they tested we would lose a few animals , seven or eight on average			0
‘ we just could n’t seem to get free of it			0
i know @entity165 ( the @entity165 ) were concerned because they carried out expensive blood tests on every animal to find out if there was a reservoir of disease in the herd			2
' it was quite clear that the reservoir of infection was outside the herd in the badger population			0
’ mr @entity3 ’s farm was one of those in the 132 sq mile @entity66 pilot badger cull , where disruption was blamed for only 274 badgers being killed - instead of the minimum 615 estimated to be needed to deliver reductions in @entity9			1
he alleged that balaclava - wearing saboteurs posted negative messages on @entity187 , followed his 19 - year - old daughter home and frightened his 88 - year - old mother @entity190			0
‘ it ’s was all pretty low level intimidation but it ’s one thing being nose to nose with somebody in a balaclava shouting at you , another when it affects your kids and your family , ’ mr @entity3 added			0
mr @entity34 yesterday claimed incidents of @entity9 had decreased in @entity28 and mr @entity3 ’s case showed similar results could be expected in @entity6			1
but campaigners were not convinced - and @entity205 , @entity207 / @entity206 ’s executive director , called the cull an ‘ very expensive , cruel and ineffective farce ’			0
she said : ' this cull fails our wildlife by subjecting badgers to inhumane shooting ; it fails farmers by promising a solution to @entity9 that simply does n't work ; and it fails the public by wasting millions of pounds of taxpayers ' money			1

@entity3 says dairy herd is free of @entity9 for first time since 2004
father claims it 's because badgers carrying disease have been killed
@entity26 insists his experience is being mirrored across @entity6
but animal rights activists say cull fails wildlife , farmers and public
