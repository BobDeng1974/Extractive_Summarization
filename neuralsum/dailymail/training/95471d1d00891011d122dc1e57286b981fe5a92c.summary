a revolutionary powder claims to be able to discover what a person has eaten , what medication they ’re on and even their sex , all from a single fingerprint			1
developed by researchers at @entity9 , the powder contains nanoparticles that stick to the ridges of prints more effectively than current powders			1
this improves the clarity of the prints by up to 40 per cent , and can pick up chemical and trace elements that reveal details about the criminal 's behaviour			1
a revolutionary powder ( pictured ) claims to be able to discover what a person has eaten , what medication they 're on and even their sex , all from a single fingerprint			1
the @entity29 powder contains nano particles that stick to the ridges of prints more effectively than current powders and the results can be obtained within minutes of the sample reaching the @entity29 lab at the northeast university , or when ran through an analytics test kit			1
the @entity29 powder produces similar results to technology recently developed by researchers from @entity41			1
their microscopic technology is called @entity44 ( @entity44 ) and it traces drugs , hair and cleaning products in fingerprints			0
it has been developed by researchers at @entity52 ’s @entity51 ( @entity53 )			2
the technology uses @entity44 - @entity44 to produce multiple images of fingermarks			0
this can reveal tiny changes in shape , and reveal particles and other elements hidden within the ridges			1
these details can be important background information in a criminal investigation , especially if the suspect 's fingerprint is not on the police database and a positive @entity69 can not be made			2
‘ a murder case can cost between £ 1m and £ 3m , with most of that in time and legwork , ’ said @entity29 's managing director @entity70			0
‘ but with this test you can say male or female , whether they are on medication , what their lifestyle is , are they taking or distributing drugs , or if they are a terrorists			2
‘ if you took 100 suspects and had each of them take the test then you could narrow it down to two or three very quickly			0
' a fingermark is made up of material from the surface of the skin , and from gland secretions			0
conventionally , fingermarks found at the scene of a crime are lifted using a powder and compared with prints on a police database to identify a suspect			1
the technology behind the new powder and test was first developed by professor @entity105 at @entity106 in 2005			2
it picks up traces of drugs , explosives and gun residue within the fingerprints ridges			2
additionally , when people ingest a medicine or drugs , they are metabolised and pass out through the pores of the skin as nanoparticles			0
it launched in january and is now being sold around the world , with the patented analytic test set to go to market in the coming months			0
these nano particles improve the clarity of the prints by up to 40 per cent , and can pick up chemical and trace elements that reveal details about the criminal left on fingerprints ( pictured )			1
the results can be obtained within minutes using an analytics test kit the powder picks up traces of drugs , explosives and gun residue within the fingerprint ridges ( pictured )			1
additionally , when people ingest a medicine or drugs , they are metabolised and pass out through the pores of the skin as nano particles the company recently received the forensics and expert witness @entity147 's annual product development award			1
‘ fingerprinting has not changed much in many years , ’ continued mr @entity70			0
‘ you go to a crime scene , brush with powder , lift the print with tape , take a photo and record it on a national database			2
but we 've done two new things with nano particles			1
‘ our powder adheres much more closely to the ridges and troughs of a fingerprint , as the particles are chemically very sticky			1
‘ [ @entity166 ] is really important as for comparison you 're looking for 12 to 20 points , and prints are often smudged			2
the @entity29 powder produces similar results to technology recently developed by researchers from @entity41			1
their microscopic technology is called @entity44 ( @entity176 ) ( pictured ) and it traces drugs , hair and cleaning products in fingerprints ‘ you can now see the details much more clearly and there is less background staining			0
’ law enforcement groups have praised the powder and said it could be used for serious crimes , such as murders , sexual assaults , and arson			0
‘ even if you drink a cup of coffee we can detect the caffeine			0
or if you smoke , ’ added mr @entity70			0
the powder also has potential benefits outside of crime investigations , in medicine for example			0
‘ because of what you can find on the surface of the skin , this could be used medically - you might even be able to tell how a drug will perform before a person even takes it , ’ concluded mr @entity70			0
‘ it 's amazing what you can find through fingerprints			0

the powder was developed by @entity214 at @entity9
it sticks more closely to nano particles in the ridges of a fingerprint
this improves the clarity of the prints by up to 40 per cent
it reveals the sex of the person , what medication they ’re on , if they ’ve fired a gun recently , what they ’ve eaten , and how much coffee they ’ve drunk
samples can be analysed in minutes within reaching the lab
