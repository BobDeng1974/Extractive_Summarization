@entity0 claimed career - best figures of six for 43 as @entity2 defeated @entity3 by four wickets to make it two wins from two in the @entity7 - but it was far closer than it should have been			1
chasing 268 for victory at the @entity11 , @entity2 were cruising at 216 for two in the 40th over with @entity13 and @entity14 well set at the crease			0
however , the hosts then lost four wickets for 32 runs , including those of @entity19 for 96 and @entity14 for 47 , as @entity3 fought back to set up a tense finish that left @entity2 still needing 15 runs off the final two overs			0
@entity2 's @entity0 appeals successfully for @entity23 to dismiss @entity3 's @entity24 ( left ) @entity25 hits @entity0 for four runs during the @entity27 @entity2 's @entity28 exchanges verbals with @entity31 batsmen @entity25 and @entity32 @entity28 and @entity25 had to be separated by the umpires after their heated debate @entity35 and @entity36 ensured @entity2 were not left with egg on their faces , though , as 16 runs were scored off the penultimate over from @entity42 to end the contest with six balls to spare			1
with @entity0 shining with the ball and @entity2 suffering a collapse with the bat before easing over the line , the match was almost identical to friday 's @entity7 opener between the home side and @entity52 , which @entity54 's men won by three wickets			2
however , while @entity58 favourites @entity2 still clearly have areas they can improve on , they have plenty of positives to reflect on as well			0
high amongst them is the form of left - armer @entity0 , who followed up his four for 42 against @entity52 with an even more devastating display on sunday as @entity3 were limited to 267 for eight after winning the toss			2
@entity36 celebrates taking the wicket of @entity68 after @entity54 catches him for nine runs @entity25 scored his sixth odi ton against @entity2 @entity25 celebrates after making his century among @entity0 's victims were opener @entity25 , who struck a superb 138 , and @entity32 , who was the only other @entity31 batsman to pass 20 as he made 51			1
@entity25 hit nine fours and four sixes in his 139 - ball knock - his sixth odi ton - and shared in a 126 - run stand with @entity32 , but @entity3 struggled to build on that solid platform as they were pegged back in the final overs			1
@entity3 will feel they should have been closer to the 300 - mark , and might have wondered if that even that score would have been enough as @entity19 , @entity14 , @entity84 ( 41 ) and @entity28 ( 24 ) powered @entity2 past 200			0
and in the end @entity2 did make their target with a bit of room to spare , but it was still far less comfortable than they would have liked			0
@entity36 makes the boundary with his hit @entity32 plays a pull shot off @entity84 @entity0 celebrates the wicket of @entity94 @entity95 plays a late cut shot against @entity3			2

@entity2 make it two wins from two in the @entity7
only @entity25 and @entity32 scored more than 20 for @entity3
@entity25 *recorded* his sixth odi ton
