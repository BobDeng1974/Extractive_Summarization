there was a split second in the tunnel of @entity4 ’s @entity3 on sunday night that summed up perfectly the 90 minutes that had gone before			2
six days out from their date with @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity6 had overcome some defensive blips to destroy @entity13 club side @entity14 5 - 3 and the @entity16 press pack wanted one man — @entity18			1
little known outside @entity6 , @entity18 has evoked memories of countryman @entity20 , who burst on to the world stage at @entity22 and ended up with the @entity23			1
potential : @entity6 striker @entity18 could emulate @entity20 's impact @entity23 : @entity20 was top scorer at @entity22 new kid on the block : @entity27 was totally outshone by @entity18 as @entity6 beat @entity28 friendly and engaging and still buzzing after a hat - trick and two assists in his third appearance for @entity6 , @entity18 held court and politely answered every question			1
about three minutes in , @entity27 came skulking down the same gangway , ignoring everyone			1
as he walked behind the oblivious @entity18 , the @entity6 ’s no 1 striker moved in to flick the rookie ’s ear — and missed			1
it was that kind of night , for them both			2
while @entity18 was an all - action nuisance to @entity14 ’s backline for his stunning 60 - minute cameo , @entity27 ’s half - hour was highlighted by him crumpling under a challenge and seeming to decide not to put too much more into the game			1
limited : @entity50 's @entity6 squad are short on striking talent but immobile could offer another option to be fair , the contest was decided by that point , but it was emphatically decided by @entity18 — and manager @entity50 must now consider him for saturday ’s @entity57 opener against @entity9			1
@entity18 said : ‘ i think i might have given him a dilemma			1
but it is better for him to have a problem like this			0
if he finds it appropriate that i play , i ’ll be there to help for sure			0
’ @entity50 added : ‘ clearly we have some healthy competition up front			0
whoever does n’t play will have to accept the choices			0
potentially there could be a lot of stars in this squad			0
’ @entity18 ’s surname means the same in @entity16 as it does in @entity78 so he has long since got used to the jibes			1
but when your movement is as devastating as his , it is easier to laugh off the immobility jokes			0
heading to the top : @entity18 scored three and set up two in the win against @entity13 side @entity28 make yourself at home : @entity18 's stylish showing came in only his third game for the @entity6 the 24 - year - old was top scorer in @entity95 last season with 22 goals for @entity98 , enough to persuade @entity99 to shell out almost £ 16million for his services last week , bringing him to @entity101 before others see him on the world stage			1
labelled a penalty - box striker in his homeland , that seems a touch unfair and slightly inaccurate			0
things may end in the area — his finishing , particularly for the third goal , was beyond clinical on sunday — but they begin much further up the pitch			0
three of @entity6 ’s five goals came as a result of @entity18 springing the offside trap			1
twice , when clear through , he unselfishly laid off for @entity122 target @entity120 to grab a brace			0
that too is a mark of the 6ft 1in former @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 striker			0
immobile is all about the collective , his tireless displays helping @entity98 to pip @entity27 ’s @entity133 to the final @entity135 spot on goal difference			1
the selfless attitude could not be more in contrast to @entity6 ’s enfant terrible			1
@entity50 said of @entity27 last month : ‘ not only does @entity27 have to realise that even in a few minutes you can make your mark			1
he must also put aside the ‘ i ’ when thinking of the group			0
’ task in hand : @entity146 is the man charged with keeping @entity6 at bay in @entity9 's @entity149 opener hot shots : midfielders @entity151 and @entity152 are the top goalscorers in @entity6 's squad goals are a pressing issue for the manager			1
while @entity6 scored 19 in qualifying , five of them from former @entity161 man @entity27 , they have got just one in three internationals in 2014 , that coming in the pitiful 1 - 1 draw with @entity165 last week			1
the two most prolific scorers in the squad are midfielders @entity152 and @entity151			0
six goals in six games was enough to get them to the final of @entity173 but a creaky defence finally gave way against @entity175			0
and that is the concern for the manager : the typical @entity16 1 - 0 win is not so easy to rely on with lesser defenders			0
@entity99 is convinced he has stolen one of the rising attacking threats in @entity135 in @entity18			1
‘ he has a proper edge , ’ he said			0
‘ he is a powerhouse who played a big role in many team goals			0
he is a real warrior			0
’ now it is up to @entity50 to decide whether his young striker is ready for @entity149 battle or keep him to spring off the bench			2
either way , @entity9 have been warned			2
@entity6 have a new attacking threat			2
on the move : @entity18 's future lies with @entity101 after he was transferred from @entity98 after a hat - trick in the final warm - up game , @entity6 striker @entity18 could be the new @entity20 , who took the @entity22 in his home country by storm			1
the @entity201 have form in bringing in untried strikers ... 1990 - @entity20 had played once for @entity6 before coming off the bench and scoring in the opening match against @entity206			2
@entity6 lost to @entity207 on penalties in the semi-final but @entity20 scored the winner against @entity9 in the third - place play - off to win the @entity23 with six goals			1
1978 - @entity213 won two caps before the tournament but scored 24 goals in 30 @entity95 games the season before			0
he scored three goals in @entity207 as @entity6 finished fourth and was the @entity23 winner four years later when they lifted the trophy			2
1998 - @entity222 scored 29 goals in 32 games for @entity225 in the build - up to @entity227 98 but only had eight caps			0
scored five goals at the tournament — one fewer than the top scorer @entity231 — as @entity6 went out to @entity227 in the quarter - finals on penalties , though @entity222 scored his			2
1970 - @entity234 had one cap heading to @entity236 but the @entity237 forward started every game			0
he scored in the semi-final against @entity241 and equalised against @entity4 in the final as @entity6 lost 4 - 1 .			2

@entity18 explodes onto the scene ahead of the @entity149
@entity27 outshone by @entity18 in only his third appearance
@entity18 could provide the striking option @entity6 need at @entity149
@entity6 open @entity149 campaign against @entity9 in @entity10 on june 14
