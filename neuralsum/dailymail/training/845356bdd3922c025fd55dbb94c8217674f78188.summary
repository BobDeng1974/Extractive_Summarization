but most eye - catching was @entity2 , who appeared as the voluptuous @entity5 character with a face full of make - up , the skimpy swimsuit and an attempt at recreating the tv star 's famous curves			0
in a stunning entrance as the crowd whooped with joy , he burst through a screen and ran onto the set in slow motion - in a nod to the classic tv show 's opening credits			1
' it 's distractingly strange , ' @entity70 said , adding of his chest : ' they 're so alarmingly real on you			0
' fellow @entity39 host @entity46 took on the role of a bare - chested @entity47 character and they were joined by former baywatch star @entity78 , who was on the show between 1997 and 1998			0

the theme of the hosts ' costumes was classic tv eye - catching : fellow host @entity70 called @entity2 's chest ' strangely distracting ' on the today show different approach : morning tv 's leading men took a very different approach to @entity10 costumes , with today 's @entity2 baring all as @entity4 while @entity19 's @entity17 was fully covered in close second came @entity48 , who had donned some busy facial hair , gold chains and camouflage to depict mr @entity100 after he jumped from an suv outside the studio , he was closely followed by @entity50 and @entity51 as classic tv duo @entity52 and @entity104			1
