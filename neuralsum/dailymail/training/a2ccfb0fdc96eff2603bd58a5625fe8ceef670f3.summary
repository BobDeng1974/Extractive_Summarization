a football coach is set to be separated from his @entity2 bride for the birth of their first child after she was banned from the @entity6 due to strict visa rules			1
@entity8 , who lives in @entity9 , south east @entity10 , and his heavily pregnant wife @entity11 are expecting their first son at the end of march			1
but mr @entity8 , 46 , has been unable to get his wife a spousal visa because he does not earn the £ 22,400 minimum which he needs to support her and her 18 - month - old son @entity19			1
@entity8 , who lives in @entity9 , south east @entity10 , and his seven - month @entity21 wife @entity11 ( pictured at their wedding in october with her son @entity19 ) face being separated for the birth of their first child before @entity11 , 26 , can move to the @entity6 , mr @entity8 also needs to prove he has at least £ 72,000 in his savings - a factor which is complicated because he is self - employed			1
he told @entity27 : ' @entity28 is always shouting about family values but these ridiculous rules are tearing families apart			0
they are not giving us a fair chance to be together ' this is the only chance i have to be there for the birth of my child , but it has been made so difficult			0
' we do n't want her to come over here and claim benefits , or take anything off the government			1
we just want to be together			0
but because i have married someone that is outside the @entity46 , i ca n't			2
' mr @entity8 met his wife in 2013 , when he visited the @entity2 for a friend 's wedding			1
his wife then came to the @entity6 for six months on a visitor 's visa before they married in the @entity2 in october			1
mr @entity8 returned to the @entity6 in january , hoping @entity11 would soon be able to follow			1
but his wife - who is seven months ' pregnant - has been unable to join him because his income does not fulfill the strict specifications			2
the football coach , who has three employees working for his business , is now urgently trying to convert the attic in his £ 350,000 home , so he can put it on the market and declare the profit as savings			1
the 46 - year - old has been unable to get a spousal visa for his wife because he falls short of the £ 22,400 minimum earning requirement to support his family , which includes her 18 - month - old son @entity19			1
he said : ' i need to do this as soon as possible so i can sell the house and have the money , just so my wife can come over and be with me			0
but if this backfires , i do n't know what i will do - it is every penny i have got			2
' the @entity78 policy , introduced in 2012 , stipulates that only @entity6 citizens , or those with refugee status , who earn at least £ 18,600 a year can sponsor their non-european spouse 's visa			1
this rises to £ 22,400 for families with a child , and a further £ 2,400 for each extra child			1
applicants can rely on cash savings to make up the total amount if they are more than £ 16,000 and held for at least six months under their control			2
but while cash savings can be combined with income from salaried employment , they can not be combined with income from self - employment			2
the @entity99 policy also states that income sources from a third party , including state benefits , are not permitted			0
it means the applicant can not use any form of welfare benefits , disability allowance , income support , housing benefit , @entity110 or other towards the minimum income requirement			2
the police states that £ 62,500 in cash savings is required if no other income sources are being used to meet the income requirement			0
it would mean someone earning less than the required minimum salary who is self - employed would need to have £ 62,000 , as well as the required difference between their salary and the threshold			1
overseas employment income , or prospective earnings from a job offer in the @entity6 , will also not be taken into account			0
therefore , only the sponsor 's employment income is considered if the applicant is not already living and working in the @entity6			0
an all - party parliamentary group said the restrictions were ' causing anguish ' with children suffering as a result			0
the @entity99 said the rules are in place so that those coming to the @entity6 for family migration ' do not become a burden on the rest of the public '			0
but mr @entity8 said he owns his own company , has £ 20,000 in savings and even owns his own home , meaning they would have no need to rely on the state			1
he said : ' i never ask for help financially ; i always pay my bills			0
yes , i am on a low income , but i do not have credit card debts and i work in a job which brings benefit to the community			0
' yet , you could have someone who is earning more than me who is not financially stable , who would not be subject to these same rules			0
' what 's crazy is that , if i had sat there and taken benefits , i would have been exempt from these rules and my wife could have been here in the @entity6 with me			1
' he added : ' i mean , what ordinary person just has £ 72,000 in their savings ? it 's impossible			1
' mr @entity8 says he can not move to the @entity2 due to a serious bowel condition , @entity173 's disease , which means he often needs treatment			1
he is also loath to leave behind the company which he set up , which visits different schools in @entity10 , coaching children and their parents in sport			0
some of his projects are supported by @entity181			0
he said : ' i have gone through every emotion there is - i ca n't sleep			0
' obviously i want to be there for my wife during labour but i ca n't just keep leaving the @entity6 , when i have work commitments			1
and the flights to and from really add up			0
' i am trying desperately now to cobble together this £ 72,000			2
i have been back from the @entity2 since january 1 and have n't even put my heating on yet - everything is costing so much money			2
' the @entity99 said : ' our requirements reflect advice from independent experts and ensure people coming here for family migration do not become a burden on the rest of the public			0
' they are also helping to ensure that those who do come to live in the @entity6 can play a full part in @entity6 life			2

@entity8 , 46 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , married @entity2 wife in october
the pair wanted to start a life together in the @entity6 with their *unborn* son
but mr @entity8 does not earn minimum £ 22,400 salary for wife to get visa
sports coach , who owns £ 350,000 home , also needs £ 72,000 in savings
he said : ' we do n't want to claim benefits - we just want to be together '
