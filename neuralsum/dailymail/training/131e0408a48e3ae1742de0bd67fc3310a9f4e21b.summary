president @entity0 sided with open - @entity2 activists on monday , urging the @entity3 to draft new rules that would reclassify the broadband net to regulate it more like a public utility			1
the end result would tie the hands of internet service providers that want to cut special deals with services like @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 to push their streaming content along a ' fast lane ' that ordinary @entity18 ca n't access			1
the @entity3 has been working on the new rule for seven months , and has received nearly 4 million comments from the public			2
its first attempt at a ' net neutrality ' rule met with the judicial axe in january with a federal court sided with @entity27 and ruled that the government agency lacks the legal authority to control how @entity2 companies set their prices			1
@entity48 said in april that his @entity3 would propose that ' broadband providers would be required to offer a baseline level of service to their subscribers , along with the ability to enter into individual negotiations with content providers			1
' ' in all instances , broadband providers would need to act in a commercially reasonable manner subject to review on a case - by - case basis			2
' @entity0 campaigned on the issue of net neutrality			1
he said in a statement monday that the @entity3 's new rules should explicitly ban any paid prioritization deals			1
' simply put : no service should be stuck in a ' slow lane ' because it does not pay a fee , ' @entity0 said			1
' that kind of gatekeeping would undermine the level playing field essential to the @entity2 's growth			0
' ' i believe the @entity3 should create a new set of rules protecting net neutrality and ensuring that neither the cable company nor the phone company will be able to act as a gatekeeper , restricting what you can do or see online			1
' he also said the @entity3 should apply its new rules equally to mobile and wired @entity56			1
two @entity94 senators pushed back – hard			0
net neutrality ' puts the government in charge of determining internet pricing , terms of service , and what types of products and services can be delivered , leading to fewer choices , fewer opportunities , and higher prices for consumers , ' @entity42 @entity95 sen. @entity41 wrote on @entity108			1
' " @entity43 " is @entity109 for the @entity2 ; the @entity2 should not operate at the speed of government , ' he added on @entity112			2
@entity94 sen. @entity113 said @entity0 's vision relied on ' rules written nearly 80 years ago for plain old telephone service			1
' ' the president ’s stale thinking would invite legal and marketplace uncertainty and perpetuate what has needlessly become a politically corrosive policy debate			0
' the move @entity0 seeks would rely on @entity124 of the @entity125 , a law that never contemplated life in the internet age			2
@entity129 , 13 time zones away : @entity0 avoided questions about his @entity43 position by having the @entity133 release a statement while he was in @entity135 the @entity136 , a trade group that represents broadband providers , said it was ' stunned the president would abandon the longstanding , bipartisan policy of lightly regulating the @entity2 and calling for extreme @entity124 regulation			1
' in taking a position in favor of net neutrality , @entity0 is siding with liberal activist groups that want the @entity3 to put @entity56 in a new category so that they can be regulated more like public utilities			1
one such group , @entity147 , is a self - described ' progressive mobile phone provider ' that operates more like a nonprofit than an @entity56			1
' this is huge , ' @entity147 political director @entity151 said monday in a statement			2
' president @entity0 just proved whose side he is on – that of the @entity18 people and an open and equal @entity2			2
' ' @entity0 ’s statement is simply a cynical political ploy , a way of playing to activists on the @entity163 who have built mailing lists and a political movement on the most absolutist conception of net neutrality , ' the libertarian think tank @entity158 said in a statement			1
' there is no dispute about the propriety of transparency rules and bans on discrimination and blocking			0
but this tectonic shift in national policy , should it be adopted , would create devastating results			0
' @entity0 waited to announce his position until after the midterm election			2
the @entity133 emailed the news to reporters while the president was in @entity135 for a @entity186 meeting			2
' an open @entity2 is essential to the @entity18 economy , and increasingly to our very way of life			0
by lowering the cost of launching a new idea , igniting new political movements , and bringing communities closer together , it has been one of the most significant democratizing influences the world has ever known			0
' " net neutrality " has been built into the fabric of the internet since its creation – but it is also a principle that we can not take for granted			1
we can not allow internet service providers ( @entity56 ) to restrict the best access or to pick winners and losers in the online marketplace for services and ideas			1
that is why today , i am asking the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) to answer the call of almost 4 million public comments , and implement the strongest possible rules to protect net neutrality			1
' when i was a candidate for this office , i made clear my commitment to a free and open @entity2 , and my commitment remains as strong as ever			0
four years ago , the @entity3 tried to implement rules that would protect net neutrality with little to no impact on the telecommunications companies that make important investments in our economy			1
after the rules were challenged , the court reviewing the rules agreed with the @entity3 that net neutrality was essential for preserving an environment that encourages new investment in the network , new online services and content , and everything else that makes up the internet as we now know it			1
unfortunately , the court ultimately struck down the rules – not because it disagreed with the need to protect net neutrality , but because it believed the @entity3 had taken the wrong legal approach			1
' the @entity3 is an independent agency , and ultimately this decision is theirs alone			0
i believe the @entity3 should create a new set of rules protecting net neutrality and ensuring that neither the cable company nor the phone company will be able to act as a gatekeeper , restricting what you can do or see online			1
the rules i am asking for are simple , common - sense steps that reflect the internet you and i use every day , and that some @entity56 already observe			0
these bright - line rules include : ' if carefully designed , these rules should not create any undue burden for @entity56 , and can have clear , monitored exceptions for reasonable network management and for specialized services such as dedicated , mission - critical networks serving a hospital			0
but combined , these rules mean everything for preserving the @entity2 ’s openness			0
' the rules also have to reflect the way people use the @entity2 today , which increasingly means on a mobile device			0
i believe the @entity3 should make these rules fully applicable to mobile broadband as well , while recognizing the special challenges that come with managing wireless networks			2
' to be current , these rules must also build on the lessons of the past			0
for almost a century , our law has recognized that companies who connect you to the world have special obligations not to exploit the monopoly they enjoy over access in and out of your home or business			0
that is why a phone call from a customer of one phone company can reliably reach a customer of a different one , and why you will not be penalized solely for calling someone who is using another provider			0
it is common sense that the same philosophy should guide any service that is based on the transmission of information – whether a phone call , or a packet of data			0
' so the time has come for the @entity3 to recognize that broadband service is of the same importance and must carry the same obligations as so many of the other vital services do			2
to do that , i believe the @entity3 should reclassify consumer broadband service under @entity124 of the @entity313 – while at the same time forbearing from rate regulation and other provisions less relevant to broadband services			2
this is a basic acknowledgment of the services @entity56 provide to @entity18 homes and businesses , and the straightforward obligations necessary to ensure the network works for everyone – not just one or two companies			0
' investment in wired and wireless networks has supported jobs and made @entity18 the center of a vibrant ecosystem of digital devices , apps , and platforms that fuel growth and expand opportunity			0
importantly , network investment remained strong under the previous net neutrality regime , before it was struck down by the court ; in fact , the court agreed that protecting net neutrality helps foster more investment and innovation			1
if the @entity3 appropriately forbears from the @entity345 regulations that are not needed to implement the principles above – principles that most isps have followed for years – it will help ensure new rules are consistent with incentives for further investment in the infrastructure of the @entity2			0
' the internet has been one of the greatest gifts our economy – and our society – has ever known			0
the @entity3 was chartered to promote competition , innovation , and investment in our networks			0
in service of that mission , there is no higher calling than protecting an open , accessible , and free @entity2			0
i thank the commissioners for having served this cause with distinction and integrity , and i respectfully ask them to adopt the policies i have outlined here , to preserve this technology ’s promise for today , and future generations to come			0

@entity41 : ' the internet should not operate at the speed of government . '
@entity3 's first ' net neutrality ' plan was struck down by a federal court in january
' this is huge , ' said @entity147 , a left - wing mobile internet service provider
president 's *announcement* was *videotaped* before his trip to @entity135 but released as he was in bed in @entity392
@entity0 's vision would bar providers like @entity27 and @entity51 from cutting deals with @entity14 , @entity12 and @entity15 so their streaming content could be delivered along online ' fast lanes '
' no service should be stuck in a " slow lane " because it does not pay a fee , ' @entity0 said
