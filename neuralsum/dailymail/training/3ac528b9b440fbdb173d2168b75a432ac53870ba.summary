together : the announcement comes just five months after he married girlfriend @entity27 , pictured support : he said that his wife had been ' supportive and awesome ' throughout the ordeal multiple sclerosis is a potentially disabling disease in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system , which includes the brain , spinal cord and optic nerves			1
all the nerve fibers in the body are covered with a protective coating called myelin			0
it works like an insulating cable , helping messages from the brain get to the spinal cord and other parts of the body quickly			0
in @entity64 , the body 's immune system turns inward and starts to attack the myelin			0
when it becomes damaged , the messages from the brain slow down or have trouble getting through			0
depending on where the damage to the myelin occurs , this will affect different parts of the body			0
symptoms can be mild , such as fatigue , or severe , including paralysis , loss of vision and slurred speech			2
there is no cure , but treatment can help manage symptoms and reduce the progress of the disease			2
