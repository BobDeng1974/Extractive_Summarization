by @entity0 published : 06:12 est , 8 april 2012 updated : 06:46 est , 8 april 2012 trapped : mrs @entity1 - who has adopted a pseudonym for her own protection - was forced into marriage at just five years old , despite living in an ordinary @entity6 town a successful businesswoman has told of her agony after being forced into an abusive marriage at the age of five - despite living in @entity6			1
@entity1 , who is now in her 40s and too frightened to reveal her real name , spoke out after revelations that @entity6 's @entity16 had handled the case of another five - year - old girl last year			2
mrs @entity1 said she believed she was being dressed for her fifth birthday party on the day of the @entity21 ceremony which effectively ended her childhood			1
she told @entity23 : ' there was a lot of activity - a lot of relatives in the house			0
i was dressed up in an outfit which my mother - in - law had bought for me			0
' my sister told me later that my mother - in - law had said , " at last , the beautiful girl belongs to me ! " ' pondering why a tiny girl from a large northern town would be forced to undergo such an ordeal , she said she thought it was to do with maintaining tradition - and control			1
mrs @entity1 was born into a close - knit @entity41 community , and while her family lived in @entity6 they remained true to the conventions of remote @entity45 villages			1
aged just 13 , she was removed from school without explanation			0
instead of an education , she was taught that a woman 's place was in the home - and reminded that the greater her sufferings on earth , the more lavish her reward would be in @entity55			0
@entity1 was still a frightened girl of 14 when she went through the formal wedding ceremony which marked her transition from her parents ' house to that of her husband			1
at 6am the day after , she was forced onto a plane to @entity45 , told only that she would return to @entity6 with her husband when she reached 16			1
long before that time , the teenager endured the forced consummation of her marriage after suffering an appalling beating			1
missing - one childhood : locked up by her husband , child bride mrs @entity1 used to watch other children playing outside and sigh with envy mrs @entity1 returned to the @entity6 three months later , after her guardians decided she should be kept there under lock and key			1
she said the feeling of sunlight on her face was one of the things she missed most during her captivity , adding , ' i used to look out at kids playing and feel an overwhelming sense of envy			0
' when you are married at the age of five you no longer live like a normal child			1
i was deprived of my basic human rights			0
' after giving birth to a daughter at the age of 20 , mrs @entity1 said she became determined her child would never endure the horrors she herself had lived through			0
the law covering forced marriage in @entity6 makes it a civil rather than a criminal matter , and many of the victims are sent abroad			1
those at risk can apply for a court order which bars them or the organisers of the marriage from leaving the country			0
violating such an order constitutes contempt of court , which carries a prison sentence of up to two years			2
while forced marriages are not recognised as legal in the @entity6 , if victims do not return to @entity6 then the people responsible can not be @entity112 is currently considering a change in the law			2
ultimately , her daughter was to be her salvation			0
though the years of abuse she had suffered took a toll on mrs @entity1 , manifesting as crippling obsessive compulsive disorder , she became interested in studying after watching her daughter 's progress through school			1
to her husband 's displeasure , she enrolled in college and took gcses			2
finally , at the age of 37 , she found the strength to leave the man who had made her life a misery , even banning her from smiling because he considered it ' the sign of a loose woman '			1
in strict @entity139 communities divorce remains strictly taboo , and those who do separate from their partners risk being ostracised by their friends and families			2
while mrs @entity1 returned to her parents after dissolving her marriage , the arrangement was not a success and she found herself entirely alone in the world			0
at her lowest ebb , contemplating suicide , she began composing a goodbye text to her beloved daughter - but could n't bring herself to abandon the best thing in her life , a child who so obviously needed her			0
finding herself outside a church , and ready to turn her back on a religion which had brought her nothing but pain and subjugation , mrs @entity1 threw herself on the mercy of a priest			2
though she said she was keen to become a @entity164 , the priest said it was not @entity21 which had failed @entity1 - it was people			0
he made contact with a @entity139 woman who provided the sobbing mother with solace , and a bed for the night			0
mentor : after ending her own forced marriage , mrs @entity1 hopes to help girls understand that @entity21 does not permit the barbaric practice - and that they too can escape it mrs @entity1 said it was not until she stopped seeing herself through other people 's eyes that she felt able to move on from her abusive marriage and take control of her own life			1
having reinvented herself as a successful entrepreneur , she now gives talks to women 's groups and mentors youngsters in her local area			1
above all , she wants to emphasise that forced marriage is completely contrary to both the teachings of @entity21 and the dignity of human beings			2
she said : ' @entity21 safeguards women 's rights , and i am delighted that i found the @entity21 that @entity196 sent down - not the one that has been hijacked by the jackals who misrepresent its true teachings			0
