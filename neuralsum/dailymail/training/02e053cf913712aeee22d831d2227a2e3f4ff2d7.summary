with 11 @entity3 goals in 21 games , @entity1 ’s season review for 2014 - 15 is unlikely to extend to cinematic length			1
ten minutes , roll credits			2
to beef it up , a section could detail @entity10 ’s role			2
it was a trip to observe @entity13 train under the @entity15 innovator at the start of last month that convinced @entity17 to adopt a new , possession - based style for a team who ca n’t score goals , do n’t create chances and serve up precious little entertainment			1
@entity1 boss @entity17 is under pressure having seen his side score just 11 league goals this season @entity27 striker @entity27 has scored just two @entity3 goals since returning from injury @entity17 decided to change his side 's style of play after watching @entity34 's @entity13 train 11 - @entity1 18 - @entity35 19 - @entity36 20 - @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 22 - @entity40 , @entity41 it was an admirable ambition by @entity17			1
the result ? ‘ too much passing , not enough purpose , ’ one observer noted			0
it is not like @entity1 were swashbuckling prior to @entity10 opening his @entity48 gates			1
but a barren run since @entity50 , with @entity1 slipping to just three points above the relegation zone , has seen supporters chant for @entity17 ’s head			1
@entity56 ’s visit , to begin a vital sequence against @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 , is hugely important			0
the atmosphere promises to be edgy			0
three supporter sites have called for those with tickets in the @entity65 to leave their seats vacant for the first eight minutes to mark the number of full seasons @entity69 has owned the club			0
watch for 82 minutes , is the idea , in recognition of the year @entity1 won the @entity73			1
few even dream those heady days can return but nor do supporters of one of @entity77 ’s oldest and biggest clubs expect to witness such limp displays on and off the field			0
there is mounting frustration @entity1 can not compete better in the transfer market or @entity3 table			1
‘ we do n’t like the word “ protest ” , it is more a demonstration , ’ said @entity89 of @entity90			0
‘ we ’d like to think this has positive connotations			0
‘ the demonstration suggests that if we continue down this path it might well be that the @entity65 is half - empty			1
’ former @entity77 and @entity1 manager @entity95 lives on the outskirts of @entity97 and has gauged the mood			1
three @entity1 fan sites are planning to leave their seat vacant for the first eight minutes on saturday former @entity1 manager @entity95 believes fans have become ' disaffected ' with their football club ‘ supporters do come up to me to express their feelings and i must say i am surprised it has taken this long for such action to materialise , ’ he said			1
‘ that is not to say i ’m advocating @entity17 getting the sack at all , just the fans have seemed disaffected for quite a while			1
’ much stems from @entity69 ’s loss of interest			0
having shot for the stars with @entity118 and missed , the @entity116 billionaire tightened the purse strings five years ago			0
he enjoyed the top - six finishes and the 2010 league cup final but grew tired of the ‘ week - in , week - out battles ’ football throws up			2
last may he announced his intention to sell up but has found no buyers , so the club finds itself in limbo			0
@entity17 ’s job is secure so long as relegation is avoided			1
@entity69 is reluctant to spend cash that will not maintain or enhance the price he wants for the club			0
chief executive @entity136 was appointed last summer from a role at @entity59 , where he negotiated large - scale sponsorship deals worth millions			2
owner @entity69 has decided to tighten his purse strings since @entity118 's departure in 2010 @entity116 billionaire @entity69 ( right ) , pictured in 2006 , is keen on selling the @entity3 club @entity1 ’s shirt sponsorship with @entity143 expires this summer			1
back in august , @entity144 was targeting up to £ 14million per year for the next deal			0
it will be a big achievement if he gets that figure			0
in the 2007 - 08 season , average crowds were 40,398 , close to capacity			2
this season the figure is 32,239 , with the lowest attendance in 15 years recorded when @entity153 visited : 25,311			0
malaise from on high creeps into the stands			0
what @entity1 followers crave is a sign of sunnier times to come , a reason to get aspirational			1
@entity17 ’s team have scored just seven goals at home in the @entity3			1
@entity167 opponents @entity58 have rippled the net more often in the city of @entity97 , following their 8 - 0 win at @entity171 ’s			2
@entity17 , not unreasonably , points to @entity1 ’s defence conceding just 23 goals , the fifth - lowest in the top flight			1
but the paucity of excitement up front is palpable			2
following consecutive , tedious 0 - 0 draws against @entity35 and @entity40 , a third against lowly @entity178 in the @entity167 beckoned until @entity27 came up with the goods late on			2
in the moments preceding his strike , home fans turned on @entity17 for the first time			1
their calls for him to be sacked found air again last time out in the 1 - 0 defeat by @entity39			2
mutiny in the stands threatens to emerge against @entity56 if @entity1 ’s recently - acquired style continues to produce a desperate dearth of scoring opportunities			1
the problem stems from hardly any of this ball retention being dangerous to opponents			0
promising winger @entity199 could be sent out on loan after failing to hold down a regular first team spot at goal kicks , full backs drop to near the corner flags to receive passes from @entity206 and build attacks			2
but frequently moves stall when crossing the halfway line			0
pace on the flanks is a huge issue , as is creativity through the middle			0
there is scarcely anything to get fans off their seats for the right reasons			0
hopes were high for winger @entity199 this season , a local lad			0
he enjoyed cameo roles that energised supporters but now finds himself out of the reckoning and looking for a loan move			0
however , the mood in camp is said to still be positive			0
@entity27 has not looked himself lately but , like @entity17 , has a habit of turning in a performance when most needed			1
@entity17 has pleaded with fans not to go through with their walkout and a win against @entity56 would lift the gloom considerably			1
until @entity69 completes a sale or @entity17 inspires a surge of form , @entity65 will continue to be cast as @entity242 .			1

@entity1 have the worst @entity3 record in front of goal
@entity17 adopted new approach after watching @entity13 train
however possession - based style has failed to work *wonders* for @entity1
the @entity256 outfit are just three points above the relegation zone
