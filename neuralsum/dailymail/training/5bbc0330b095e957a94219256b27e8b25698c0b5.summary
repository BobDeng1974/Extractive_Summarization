thriller : counter-terrorism expert @entity2 's biography reads like a real - life man of international intrigue his past exploits as a counter-terrorism agent could have come straight from the plot of a @entity9 thriller			1
he has fled angry nazis in @entity11 , been interrogated in 1980s @entity12 , dined with @entity14 mafioso and explored tunnels beneath the demilitarized zone separating the @entity17			1
but now former mercenary @entity2 , 65 , is trying to put that extraordinary past behind him as he takes on his latest mission : to become @entity22 's next governor			1
the role , where chairing the state land board and congratulating state football champions could count as an exciting day , would be a significant change of pace			0
the former secret agent , who says he was once wrongly subpoenaed for gun running and involvement in the @entity31 , may not want his colourful history putting off voters in his home state			0
like the time he was on the yacht belonging to a swashbuckling pirate whose other guests included numerous hookers ? he was on a mission , he says , securing private planes to spy on a foreign country			1
@entity12 documents leaked last year stated that @entity2 was among a small group seeking a multi-million dollar payday to help @entity48 find a safe haven			1
derring - do : @entity2 is now trying to gloss over some of his more hair - raising past exploits in order to become @entity22 's next governor @entity2 , who has been a vocal critic of @entity48 , said he was trying to bring a quick end to the bloodshed			1
the deal was rebuffed by the @entity58 administration			0
@entity2 , a @entity59 , does n't think his extraordinary background or his list of controversial past clients harms his chances			1
he said : ‘ without going into detail that i ca n't , i have served as a liaison for my government and others in terms of dealing with most of the difficult people on @entity70			0

’ mercenary : leaked documents showed @entity2 offered to help @entity48 flee the revolution - in return for millions of dollars this spectacular list of exploits was removed from his campaign website late last week after he decided that ‘ salacious ’ excerpts from his long biography could give people the wrong idea			1
@entity2 most recently ran a company he started in 2007 called executive action — the same term used by the @entity98 in the 1950s to refer to their assassination operations			2
he started that company after leaving another called @entity102 , which billed itself as a ‘ private @entity98			0
’ @entity2 said in an interview that he wound down operations at @entity96 in order to return full time to his home state and run for governor			2
two individuals with intricate knowledge of the business , however , told @entity111 in interviews that @entity2 had no choice but to lay off staff and close the doors			2
the former associates , speaking only on the condition of anonymity due in part to the close - knit nature of intelligence - related businesses , said @entity96 's only substantial client stopped paying and it was unable to recruit other meaningful business			0
