a grandfather who knew his frozen - loving granddaughter was disappointed when it failed to snow as much as forecasters had predicted delivered her a truck of snow so she could build a snowman			1
@entity8 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , had the idea after his home was battered with winter weather , pushing back a trip to see his four - year - old granddaughter in @entity16 , @entity17			1
the little girl , @entity19 , had been sad that she had n't received as much snow as her grandfather , her mother @entity18 told the @entity22			2
dream come true : four - year - old @entity19 is pictured with the snowman she built in @entity17 after her kind - hearted grandfather delivered her a truck of snow that he drove from his home in @entity10 ' as the storm came , or rather did n't come , and i was talking to my dad on the phone i casually mentioned to him that i wished i could teleport @entity19 up to him with his 18 inches of snow since all she wanted to do was build a snowman , ' she said			1
so the kindhearted grandfather , known to his granddaughter as ' @entity38 ' , borrowed a front - loader from his employer and used it to fill the bed of his truck with snow			1
then he started the nearly 400 mile journey south			0
' when he got here , he had a tarp over the back of his truck , and i kept asking what was in the back , ' @entity19 said			2
' he just kept telling me not to worry about it - it was something for work			0
' he had planned to surprise @entity19 right away but when he arrived , the area was being battered by rain and he did n't want her experience to be ruined - so he waited until the skies cleared			0
good thinking : @entity8 used his employer 's front loader to fill up the bed of his truck with snow after learning that his granddaughter was disappointed that she could n't build a snowman in @entity17 surprise ! after driving nearly 400 miles , he shoveled it out onto her lawn with the help of her father when he finally told @entity19 , she put @entity19 in her @entity71 costume from the movie ' @entity73 ' and allowed the youngster to stay home from school so that she could play in the snow			1
with the help of @entity19 's father , @entity78 , @entity8 shoveled out the snow and the little girl could finally get to work on her snowman			2
' everything else in the neighborhood has melted and is pretty dry , ' @entity19 said			0
' then there 's just this random snowman in our yard			0
he 's a little shorter than he was , but he 's still there			0
' @entity16 received an inch of snow during last week 's snowstorm , while @entity9 was lumped with more than a foot			0
@entity93 : @entity8 helps him overjoyed granddaughter climb to the top of the snow after her special delivery getting to work : after her parents kept her home from school , he then helped her build a snowman			1

@entity8 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , knew his granddaughter @entity19 was disappointed when her @entity17 home failed to get much snow
so he borrowed a front - loader truck to fill up his truck with snow and drove *375* miles to her home
her parents let her have the *day* off school so she could finally build a snowman
