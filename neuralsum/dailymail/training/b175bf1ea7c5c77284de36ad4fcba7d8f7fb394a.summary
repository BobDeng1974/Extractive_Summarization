by @entity0 published : 09:17 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 10:57 est , 16 september 2013 she might be an ' ambassador ' for the @entity2 but @entity3 has been a rare sight at @entity5 so far			2
but it seems @entity8 's first lady of fashion is making up for lost time after she appeared front row at @entity12 and @entity13 this morning			1
mrs @entity3 , who wore a black textured top from @entity16 high street brand cos and a @entity18 skirt , is also expected to attend the @entity20 show later today			1
stylish : mrs @entity3 was seen in a @entity15 top and @entity18 skirt at @entity13 and @entity12 elegant : @entity3 showed off her penchant for bright colours and was front row at @entity13 and @entity12 minimal : @entity13 offered an unusually muted vision for @entity28 with his trademark florals replaced with feathers new direction : although @entity13 's ladylike silhouettes remained , he plumped for a monochrome palette she was joined at the shows by @entity37 editor @entity36 , who was composed and elegant in a burgundy check coat with grey fur tippets			1
also at the show was @entity42 stylist @entity41 , socialite @entity43 and veteran model @entity44			2
but while all eyes were on @entity3 off the catwalk , on the runway , both @entity13 and @entity12 were busy underlining exactly why he 's worth a visit from @entity37			1
@entity13 offered up a typically ladylike assortment of elegant shift dresses and clean tailoring but eschewed traditional florals , plumping instead for feathers			0
unusually , colour was low on the @entity13 agenda , with chic black and white dominating the subdued palette			0
stunning : @entity12 's latest collection appeared on the catwalk at the @entity59 in @entity60 @entity61 : the latest collection from the @entity8 designer had ladylike touches and a real sense of humour sheer genius : delicate spaghetti straps and neon panels stylised : big sequinned lillies were the flower of choice pastels : pistachio , blush and lavender dominated the palette @entity12 , by contrast , offered up a colourful riot of pastels and print of the sort we 'll all want to buy into come next summer			2
highlights included cleverly cut shifts with delicate leaf - shaped cutouts in blush , pistachio and lavender , and a delicate white spaghetti - strapped dress with sheer neon panels			0
in true @entity12 style , it was ladylike , sexed - up and boasting a very naughty sense of humour			0
bold blooms , a summer staple , appeared on skirts , dresses and sweatshirts in the form of supersized , stylised lillies and orchids			0
it was all very much in line with what we 've come to expect from @entity12 and while there were n't huge numbers of fresh ideas on show , you could n't help but reflect that since @entity12 has clearly hit on a winning formula , he 'd have to be mad to change it			0
perfect prints : @entity12 's new collection featured plenty of print and some wonderful oversized blooms front row : @entity123 @entity37 editor @entity36 and @entity42 stylist @entity41 joined @entity3 stylish : @entity43 wore a leather mini to @entity12 while @entity125 plumped for a daring dress			1

mrs @entity3 was all *smiles* as she arrived at @entity12
she later made an appearance at fashion favourite @entity13
@entity36 and @entity41 were also at @entity12 's show
