by @entity0 published : 20:57 est , 3 march 2013 updated : 04:20 est , 4 march 2013 @entity2 may be making unsolicited phone calls to more than four million homes every year , a survey found yesterday			1
the energy giant , which made profits of more than £ 600million last year , was among the biggest users of cold calling , according to the research			1
the marketing calls are often regarded as a nuisance or even sinister			1
marketing calls are often regarded as a nuisance or even sinister ( file photo ) there has been particular concern over ‘ silent ’ calls , when householders pick up the phone but no voice speaks to them			1
the scale of marketing calls was estimated following a survey carried out in 20,000 homes where an answering unit was fitted to record the number of incoming calls			1
@entity2 was among the most prolific callers , the results showed			2
it made 7,000 cold calls to 900 homes over the course of a year , almost eight calls to each household			1
if unsolicited calls from @entity2 are made on the same scale nationwide , researchers calculated , it is likely to have made calls to 4.1million homes			1
its involvement in the unpopular marketing approach threatens fresh embarrassment for the firm at a time when its high profit levels have been attracting criticism			2
figures published last week showed profits of £ 606million , swelled by increased energy use during the first months of the cold winter , and a 6 per cent price increase in november			0
the profits were the equivalent of £ 50 for every one of the 12million homes which buy energy from @entity2			1
@entity60 mp @entity59 told the @entity61 , which commissioned the study , that : ‘ certain groups of people , particularly the elderly who may be at home all day , will not answer their telephone unless they recognise the number because they are so concerned about nuisance calls			0
' some people tell me that they are getting five or six of these sorts of calls every day			0
‘ and when these calls are silent that causes real concern for the elderly who first thought may be that it is someone they know who is in trouble and ca n’t speak or that it is someone out to frighten and intimidate them			0
this simply can not be allowed to continue			0
’ the company said yesterday : ‘ this is a highly regulated area and we take our obligations extremely seriously			0
' when we do call our customers it is always with their permission or when we have undertaken all relevant checks to confirm consent			0
' we uphold the highest standards of customer service and when calling it is to offer people information on products and services that may save them money or offer peace - of - mind , such as boiler care			1
’ a spokesman added that the company was using new calling systems to stop silent calls			0
@entity2 may be making unsolicited phone calls to more than four million homes every year these play a recorded announcement if the system believes a real person rather than an answering machine has picked up the call			1
silent calls happen when an automated unsolicited sales call is made to a number with the intention that a salesman or woman will speak to them			2
however , when the householder answers the phone , all the call centre sales staff are already tied up on other calls			0
as a result , the individual who picks up the phone hears only a potentially threatening silence			0
@entity2 said : ‘ we have invested heavily in state - of - the art technology which stops silent calls			1
’ other companies making heavy used of unsolicited sales calls are @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 , the survey carried out for the @entity61 found			2
rules on unsolicited sales calls are set by the regulator @entity140 , which has fined companies for making silent calls , but has not named companies which made them			2
these companies are usually specialist operators working for household name businesses			0
the regulator allows sales operators to make three per cent of their calls ‘ silent ’ calls in which nobody speaks to the recipient .			0

firm made 7,000 cold calls to 900 homes over the course of a year
almost eight marketing calls to each household , researchers found
@entity2 says it only calls to offer information on products and services
