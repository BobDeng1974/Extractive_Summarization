by @entity0 published : 09:29 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 11:31 est , 27 august 2013 a bride - to - be was ' disfigured ' at her engagement party when a woman who had once appeared on the @entity5 show deliberately smashed a glass into her face , a jury was told today			1
it should have been one of the happiest days in @entity9 ’ life - but @entity12 ’s attack on her made it one of the worst , said prosecutor @entity13 at @entity14			1
@entity15 , of @entity16 , suffered a broken nose , a ‘ gaping ’ 2cm wound on the bridge of her nose and two other cuts - one to the side of the nose and one to the eye , he said			1
it was suggested during the trial that @entity12 's past appearance on the @entity5 show was the trigger which led to the alleged attack			1
scarred : @entity9 ( left ) , the bride - to - be who suffered wounds to her face following an attack at her engagement party			1
@entity12 ( right ) is alleged to have glassed @entity39 the defence suggested that @entity15 had been ' taunting ' @entity12 about her appearance on the controversial show and the violence then broke out			1
details of why @entity12 appeared on @entity5 were not given to the jury			2
just before she glassed @entity48 , the defendant told her : ' i suppose you think you ’re f * * * * * * pretty - well you wo n’t be now , ' it was alleged			2
child - minder @entity12 , 27 , of @entity53 , @entity54 , denies wounding @entity39 with intent to cause her grievous bodily harm on the night of 1/2 december last year at the @entity57 in @entity53			1
she also denies assaulting another woman guest , @entity58 , by beating			0
the jury was told that she has , however , admitted a less serious assault on @entity15 and a charge of assault on @entity58 ’s sister , @entity63			1
mr @entity13 told the jury that the assaults on the @entity58 sisters happened between about 10.30 - 10.45pm that night			0
they were sparked , he said , by @entity63 bad - mouthing @entity12 ’s boyfriend @entity68			1
the @entity57 in @entity53 , where the alleged attack took place @entity63 had gone out with mr @entity68 before @entity12 became his girlfriend , mr @entity13 said			2
surprisingly , in view of the attacks on the sisters , @entity12 was still at the pub an hour later when she glassed @entity15 , he added			1
' she left the most serious assault until last , ' he said			0
' glass in hand she hit and disfigured @entity9			2
' ' rather than being one of the happiest days of @entity9 ’ life , her engagement party , it turned out to be one of the worst			2
' @entity9 had thrown the party at the @entity85 with her fiance @entity86 because her father was a manager at the hotel , he said			1
mr @entity13 told the jury the first assault happened when @entity63 was in an alleyway and @entity12 approached her and said she was fed up with what she was saying about her bloke			2
' she grabbed @entity63 ’s hair and banged her head against a wall			0
two people intervened to stop her			0
one of those who intervened was @entity63 ’s sister @entity99			0
' during that intervention and the general melee the defendant punched @entity99 in the face			0
' mr @entity13 said @entity12 was pulled away			0
an hour later she approached @entity15 in the bar and was ‘ having a go at her ’ when pub landlord @entity107 pulled her away			0
the case is being heard at @entity14			2
@entity12 denies wounding @entity15 with intent to cause her grievous bodily harm he was talking to her in the alleyway and telling her to calm down when she saw @entity15 in a back smoking area			1
' understandably @entity15 was upset about the earlier incident and was saying something about the defendant which ms @entity12 overheard			1
' ' on hearing her the defendant responded by going to the smoking area			0
it is an undisputed fact in this case that she went there to have another go at @entity9			0
' the prosecution say she was on the warpath and it was obvious to everyone in the smoking area that she was after @entity9			0
' @entity12 was arrested about an hour after the glassing and made no comment - except to say to a police officer : ' no - one is going to want me to look after their kids now that i have glassed someone in the face			1
' yet in her defence statement @entity12 has denied saying that to the officer - and denied that she had a glass in her hand			1
she also disputed that @entity9 ’s injuries were caused by a glass , said mr @entity13			2
it was suggested during the trial that @entity12 's past appearance on the @entity151 ( pictured ) was the trigger which led to the alleged attack cross-examining her , defence lawyer @entity154 asked her about @entity156 footage of her and @entity157 talking in the hotel bar			1
' i suggest it was a reasonably friendly chat but it got a bit difficult after that because you made reference to her appearing some time earlier on the @entity166 ? ' asked mr @entity154 ' she appeared live on the show discussing a subject which is not desperately important to this case but no doubt it caused some local interest in @entity53 to all who knew her			0
did you watch the show ? ' ms @entity9 said she did			0
' it was when you mentioned that that things became heated between you i suggest ? ' said mr @entity154			0
' do you remember ? ' ms @entity9 said ' no. ' the trial continues			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
