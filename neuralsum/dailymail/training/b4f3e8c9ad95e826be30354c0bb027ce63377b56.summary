@entity0 has come under fire for its election plans to try to encourage voting - and mine its users data for political preferences			1
the firm announced plans to mine data of millions of @entity12 voters , just as an experiment which tried to encourage people to vote was disclosed			1
the data mining is likely to prove controversial as it adds to the amount @entity0 knows about its users - although the company itself says that the data is anonymized before being processed			1
the move was announced as a controversial 2010 study has been revealed called ' a 61 - @entity24 in @entity25 and @entity26 , '			1
it found that around 20 percent of the users who saw that their friends had voted also clicked on an ' i voted ' button @entity0 is set to make available			1
user data : @entity0 says it 's mining its users ' posts to analyze sentiment regarding candidates and issues for the 2014 and 2016 elections earlier this year @entity0 issued tough new guidelines on research using its system following outrage from users over experiments on the social network			1
the firm tightened its research guidelines following uproar over its disclosure this summer that it allowed researchers to manipulate users ' feeds to see if their moods could be changed			0
at issue was study in which @entity0 allowed researchers to manipulate the content that appeared in the main section , or ' news feed , ' of small fraction of the social network 's users			1
as part of the study , @entity0 put different forms of an ' i 'm voting ' button on the pages of about 60 million of its @entity12 users			1
company researchers were testing them to understand the effect of each and to determine how to optimize the tool 's impact , according to @entity77			0
two groups of 600,000 users were left out to serve as a control group — one which saw the ' i 'm voting ' button but did n't get any information about their friends ' behavior , and one which saw nothing related to voting at all			0
however , experts have warned the feature could be misused			0
@entity90 , a professor of law and computer science at @entity92 , believes the search giant could even influence the outcome of an election			0
' consider a hypothetical , hotly contested future election , ' he wrote in @entity97			0
' suppose that @entity98 personally favors whichever candidate you do n't like			0
' he arranges for a voting prompt to appear within the newsfeeds of tens of millions of active @entity0 users , but unlike in the 2010 experiment , the group that will not receive the message is not chosen at random			1
@entity0 founder @entity98 declines to declare how he votes – but he has allied himself with immigration reform , one of the key causes of liberals in @entity12			2
it is probably the biggest clue to how he thinks politically			0
he founded an action group which aims to give legal status to 11 million immigrants who do not have official permission to be in the @entity12 , an amnesty which is fiercely opposed by conservatives			0
@entity119 is also supported by @entity120 of @entity121 , @entity122 of @entity123 and @entity124 of @entity125			0
the group aims to mirror the success of @entity129 ’s new technology with lobbying and activism but has itself been hit by controversy when some liberal supporters quit it over it offering support for a controversial oil pipeline			0
and he has also criticized surveillance by the @entity139 and other spy agencies , which resulted in him meeting president @entity142 to discuss his concerns in march this year			0
a company spokesman praised the president for his ‘ engagement ’			0
conservatives have also claimed @entity98 as one of their own			0
he has raised money for charter schools in @entity152 alongside its @entity154 governor @entity153			0
the schools are opposed by liberals who object to teaching unions not being recognized			0
@entity98 himself claims to be ‘ post left and right ’ and interested in a ‘ knowledge economy ’			0
' rather , @entity98 makes use of the fact that @entity0 ' likes ' can predict political views and party affiliation , even beyond the many users who proudly advertise those affiliations directly			1
' with that knowledge , our hypothetical @entity98 chooses not to spice the feeds of users unsympathetic to his views			0
' such machinations then flip the outcome of our hypothetical election			0
should the law constrain this kind of behavior ? the firm will also collect data on its users in upcoming elections , it revealed today			2
' given the volume of conversation around politics on @entity0 , we believe this data truly represents what the @entity12 people think about the potential candidates , ' said @entity194 's director of news and @entity195 in a statement			1
coverage : @entity198 , whose 2012 @entity200 coverage with @entity202 is pictured here , will use the data in their coverage of the 2014 midterm elections with an eye on contenders for 2016 the data will be collected and shared with @entity198 and @entity210 , to be used in 2014 and 2016 election day coverage			0
however , experts have warned the social network could eventually use it to sell targeted advertising - and even influence the outcome of an election			2
sociologist @entity218 told @entity219 ' of all the online platforms , @entity0 probably has most information about its users			1
' recent research shows that even a slice of @entity0 data can reveal a person 's political leanings , gender , sexual orientation , race , personality characteristics by datamining their acts on @entity0 -- in other words , without ever asking the user and even if you have never identified them			1
the @entity239 - based firm carried out its most controversial experiment during a week in 2012			2
during that time , negative posts were deprioritised in the data feeds of 689,003 users , to see if it generated a more positive response			2
posts were determined by the experiment to be positive or negative if they contained at least one positive or negative word			0
the experiment affected around 0.04 per cent of users - or 1 in 2500			2
according to @entity0 , nobody 's posts were ' hidden , ' they just did n't show up on some feeds			2
it found that negative posts elicited a swell of positive responses , but also that a reduction in positive news led to more negative posts			2
‘ when positive expressions were reduced , people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts ; when negative expressions were reduced , the opposite pattern occurred , ’ said the researchers			0
during the weeklong study in january 2012 , data - scientists were trying to collect evidence to prove their thesis that people 's moods could spread like an ' emotional contagion ' depending on what they were reading			1
' although this subject matter was important to research , we were unprepared for the reaction the paper received when it was published and have taken to heart the comments and criticism , ' @entity273 , @entity0 's chief technology officer , wrote in a blog post			2
' while this particular program is slated as one that anonymizes user data , @entity0 has this information and could in the future potentially sell it to political campaigns as a targeting tool			1
' hence , a political campaign could potentially target people of a particular political leaning , personality type , gender , or sexual orientation with targeted ads that would not be visible to anyone else , or nudge to motivate or demotivate a person to vote			0
' @entity300 reports that @entity0 will glean the data from posts by users in the @entity12 18 or older and will use sentiment analysis about specific politicians			1
sentiment analysis gauges whether a person 's opinion about another person or subject is positive , negative or neutral , often by tracking keywords			1
the analysis looks to be more sophisticated than how media outlets have used @entity0 and other social media platforms in the past			1
the data will be searchable by gender and location , allowing analysis to be done on a state - by - state basis and giving the ability to isolate sentiment about specific issues in primary states like @entity325			1
@entity300 reports that @entity0 will glean the data from posts by users in the @entity12 18 or older and will use sentiment analysis about specific @entity329 analysis gauges whether a person 's opinion about another person or subject is positive , negative or neutral , often by tracking keywords			1
an unnamed @entity0 representative said the data ' is gathered in an aggregated and depersonalized manner in a privacy safe way			2
' @entity198 plans to begin using @entity0 data next week as part of its 2014 @entity200 coverage , paying attention to the potential 2016 candidates			2
the data will help ' identify the most important trends and the most stimulating conversations happening around the 2016 election cycle , ' said @entity198 president @entity348 in a statement			0
@entity210 will integrate the data into election stories and use it in their news app , with editor in chief @entity356 enthusiastic about the @entity0 partnership			1
' @entity0 is going to be a central -- maybe the central -- arena in which political conversation happens in 2016 , ' he said in a statement			2
a @entity363 poll released last week showed that 48 percent of web users said they consumed news on @entity0 while 14 percent got news from @entity367			1
@entity368 came in at 9 percent while @entity369 only had 6 percent of web users reading news on the platform .			1

the social media site will mine data from users 18 and older , using sentiment analysis and will allow outlets to sort by *categories* like gender and location
controversial 2010 study called ' a 61 - @entity24 in @entity25 and @entity26 ' under fire
a recently release @entity363 study found that an large amount of web users get news from @entity0
