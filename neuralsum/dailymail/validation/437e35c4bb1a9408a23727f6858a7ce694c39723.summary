@entity1 boss @entity0 praised the self - belief of his players after seeing them fight back to snatch a vital @entity6 qualifier draw against @entity7			1
@entity1 looked to be heading for a damaging defeat as the @entity10 encounter ticked into injury time with the @entity12 within touching distance of three more points to add to the 10 they had reaped from their opening four games			1
however , @entity0 's men summoned up a final push to rescue a point when substitute @entity21 prodded home a 91st - minute equaliser to make it 1 - 1 and ensure that the spoils were shared at the @entity26			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 praised the self - belief of his players after their draw with @entity7 @entity1 nicked a point after they looked to be heading for a damaging defeat in the @entity10 encounter asked what the message had been at half - time after a distinctly ordinary 45 minutes by his team , @entity0 said : ' just keep self - belief , that 's really important , really important			1
' we felt we had not done ourselves justice in the first half			0
but you have got to keep self - belief , that 's really important for the side			1
' that was the message , ' know that you are still in this game , that we can do better , much better , we can improve '			0
we 'd given away a really soft goal from our viewpoint , it put us on the back foot for a while , but we definitely could do it			0
' the players rose to the occasion , which was great			0
that self - belief was really important			1
@entity7 , it 's a great point away from home as far as they 're concerned , but we are still well in it			2
' @entity1 created little of note before the break and found themselves trailing to @entity60 's 26th - minute opener after he capitalised on an error by makeshift full - back @entity62			2
but the home side rallied after the restart and after @entity62 and @entity67 had both hit the post , @entity21 struck at the death to level it			2
@entity21 runs away in celebration after scoring the equaliser for his team in the @entity10 qualifer @entity21 is congratulated by @entity75 ( right ) as @entity1 snatched a hard - earned point it may not have been the victory the @entity1 craved to propel themselves back into the hunt for automatic qualification , but it was not the defeat @entity0 had admitted in advance would cause a ' big dent ' in their hopes			1
nevertheless , they will entertain @entity88 in june sitting in fourth place in the group , still three points behind the @entity12 and two adrift of @entity93 and the @entity94			0
@entity7 boss @entity95 was disappointed to have seen two points wrenched from his grasp , but happy enough with a scoreline he believed was fair			2
he said : ' overall , i believe the result was a fair scoreline			0
we played a very good first half and maybe lacked a bit of quality , but overall , we are content with a draw			0
' three points were really close , but one point is also a good result			0
it 's no surprise that @entity1 came back to score an equaliser because the other results show that they know how to play to the end and get a result in their favour at the end of the game			0
' @entity0 's men summoned a final push to rescue a point when substitute @entity21 scored a 91st - minute equaliser			1

@entity1 drew 1 - 1 with @entity7 in their @entity10 encounter
*manager* @entity0 has praised his players ' self - belief
they looked to be heading for defeat before @entity21 equalised late on
