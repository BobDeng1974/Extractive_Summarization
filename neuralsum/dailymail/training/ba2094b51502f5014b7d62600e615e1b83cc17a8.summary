retiring @entity33 senator @entity32 chaired the committee and was damning in his assessment of both @entity10 and the @entity5 over an investigation of @entity37 ( @entity38 ) advisers between 2006 and 2010			1
@entity10 chairman @entity40 acknowledged the watchdog 's shortcomings when it investigated the bank the bank failed to open its books and fully identify the number of clients affected and those entitled to compensation , he said			1
and @entity10 was too slow to act			0
' it has been unresponsive , it has n't taken reports seriously , it has n't pursued investigations properly , agreements that have been reached have n't been enforced , it 's tale is a tale of woe , ' senator @entity32 told @entity57			0
@entity10 chairman @entity40 did not deny that the watchdog could have done more to investigate the allegations , the @entity58 reported			2

@entity5 is now required to review the cases of more than 4,000 clients for compensation			0
the committee investigated @entity10 's slow response to bank whistleblowers who alerted the regulator to suspect conduct by financial advisers that included forging client signatures to facilitate profit - producing product switches			1
