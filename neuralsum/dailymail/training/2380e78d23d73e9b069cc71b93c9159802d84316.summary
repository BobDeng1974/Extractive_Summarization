increased risk : pregnant women who suffer severe morning such as the @entity2 , pictured leaving hospital in december , are more at risk of pre-eclampsia , a study has found severe morning sickness that blighted the early weeks of the @entity2 ’s pregnancy could cause complications for mother and baby , doctors said yesterday			1
those who , like @entity2 , need hospital treatment for the sickness before 12 weeks of pregnancy are around 20 per cent more likely to be at risk of pre-eclampsia , a study has found			1
but experts said they hoped the timing of @entity2 ’s sickness , which came early in her pregnancy , meant she would escape the most worrying consequences because the condition is most hazardous when it occurs during the middle three months			1
in early december , the @entity2 was admitted to @entity24 suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum , a rare disorder that triggers severe vomiting during pregnancy			2
@entity2 , whose baby is due in july , was forced to cancel engagements following repeated bouts of sickness and dehydration			1
but @entity35 officials say she is now making a steady recovery and she has been seen out and about in public looking much better			0
her condition is most common in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy , after which the symptoms ease in most sufferers			2
but the new research suggests that when the condition occurs during the second trimester , it can lead to serious complications in later pregnancy that need close monitoring			0
the complications include pre-eclampsia , which raises the woman ’s blood pressure leading to strokes and even death , premature separation of the placenta from the womb lining before birth , and having a small baby			2
the study , published in @entity60 : an @entity61 , examined data from the @entity64 medical birth register between 1997 and 2009			0
data from 1,155,033 women showed that 1.1 per cent of them suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum before they were 22 weeks pregnant			2
the condition is caused by high levels of the pregnancy hormone , human chorionic gonadotropin , and a woman ’s sensitivity to it			0
researchers compared data from women having normal pregnancies to those who needed admission to hospital for treatment in the first or second trimester of pregnancy			0
danger : pre-eclampsia is more common in first - time pregnancies and can lead to premature birth , still birth and babies being born smaller than average they found a slightly increased risk of almost 20 per cent in the rate of pre-eclampsia in women who were hospitalised with sickness before 12 weeks of pregnancy			1
pre-eclampsia is more common in first - time pregnancies and can lead to premature birth , stillbirth and babies being smaller than average			1
as many as one in 20 first - time mothers develop pre-eclampsia , while around 20 women die each year from conditions linked to high blood pressure			0
it is thought to claim the lives of 600 babies a year in the @entity108 .			0

pregnant women who need hospital treatment before 12 weeks are 20 per cent more likely to suffer pre-eclampsia , study finds
can lead to premature birth , still birth or smaller than average baby
experts say @entity2 should escape because her sickness came early
