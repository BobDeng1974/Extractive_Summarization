a @entity1 gym became a robotic warzone yesterday as drones battled it out in an annual engineering contest			0
the competition involved six teams of engineering students who were each given $ 800 ( £ 480 ) to create machines that could fly or drive their way to victory			1
organised by the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) , this year ’s theme was ‘ @entity13			2
’ a quadcopter drags a competitor quadcopter off the platform during in this image showing the robots battling it out for a winning place in the contest students had to manoeuvre their robots on the basketball court inside @entity25			2
the aim was to collect an empty soup can and get it to as close to the top a wooden hill after four - minute rounds			1
they also had to prevent or obstruct the other team ’s robot from reaching the platform			1

the winners were a team dubbed ‘ 40 @entity73 ’ who created two identical rovers that drove instead of flew			1
in the final round , it came down to the @entity73 and a team called the @entity79 , which used their budget to make three roving robots as well as one flying design			0

six teams of mechanical engineering majors are competing as part of a final project and core requirement , in which their robotic vehicles must climb or fly to get empty soup cans into an elevated five - foot target platform , while preventing competitor robots from doing the same @entity35 team members @entity105 ( left ) , @entity34 and @entity106 ( right ) make robot repairs ‘ it ’s all very practical , ’ mr @entity83 said			1
‘ you do n’t want engineers making rockets that go into the ocean instead of into orbit			0
’ the ‘ @entity118 ’ , a team based on the @entity120 tv show , created a flying quadcopter named @entity115 and a tank named @entity117			0
meanwhile , a group called ' @entity35 ' took a defensive strategy with rovers named @entity124 and @entity125 that could rundown opponents			0
