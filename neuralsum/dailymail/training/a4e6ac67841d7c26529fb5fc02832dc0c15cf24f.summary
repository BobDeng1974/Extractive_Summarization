by @entity0 published : 17:22 est , 2 february 2013 updated : 05:49 est , 3 february 2013 a grandmother facing execution in @entity3 for drug - smuggling nearly lost her chance to appeal against her sentence because of an astonishing @entity8 mix - up			1
after 56 - year - old @entity12 was sentenced to death by firing squad 12 days ago for smuggling £ 1.6 million worth of cocaine , @entity11 @entity10 officials offered to submit a letter to court on her behalf , saying that she intended to contest the penalty			1
@entity12 had seven days after her sentencing to file the letter			2
at first she did not want to appeal , but finally agreed and the embassy got the letter to the court last monday – the final possible day			2
but 90 minutes before the court closed for the day , @entity3 officials rejected the letter , saying it had to come from the prison and not from diplomats			0
her last - gasp plea for an appeal hearing was finally accepted after a @entity8 blunder a local consular official had to call @entity12 ’s 61 - year - old sister @entity32 – who is staying in an £ 18 - a - night guest house five minutes ’ walk from the prison – and she phoned a male prisoner inside @entity46 jail to ask him to raise @entity12 in the women ’s block			1
but the @entity49 , sedated after falling into a deep depression over her death penalty , was asleep			0
as the clock ticked down , she was woken and ran to the prison office , where a letter was quickly drafted			0
a consular official dropped it at the court 30 minutes after closing time – and after a nerve - racking 18 - hour wait , it was accepted the following morning			1
yesterday ms @entity32 accused the @entity8 of cruelly mishandling her sister ’s case			1
‘ i am appalled at their incompetence and insensitivity , ’ she said			0
‘ when i got her on the end of a phone i said , “ get up , wake up , go to the prison office and get them to write the letter as quick as you can			0
” accused : @entity12 , alleged to be the ringleader of the plot to smuggle the drugs , has apparently made death threats to ms @entity12 , according to her sister ‘ it was absolutely terrifying			1
when the court closed , we had to endure a night believing the chance to appeal against the sentence was gone			0
‘ it was all left to me and i was made to feel it would have been my fault if she ’d missed the chance to appeal against the death penalty			2
’ ms @entity32 , who moved to @entity3 in october from her home in @entity88 to be near her sister , added : ‘ @entity12 has been distressed at their behaviour all the way along			1
she told me many times that they do n’t know what they are doing			0
when you get here and see what is going on , you understand what she ’s up against			0
’ ms @entity32 said her sister ’s ordeal had been made even worse by repeated death threats from the men she claimed forced her to smuggle the cocaine from @entity105 to @entity3 – @entity11 @entity12 , who was given six years , and @entity12 , who is serving four years			1
‘ we were sitting in the prison office together when @entity12 went past on his way to go to court			0
he put his head in the window and laughed at us			0
’ ms @entity32 says @entity12 was told there would be a gang ‘ waiting for her ’ in prison and that other inmates had been threatened for talking to her			2
ms @entity32 has now launched a website to raise awareness of her sister ’s legal fight			2
a @entity8 source last night confirmed ms @entity32 ’ account of the chaos surrounding the appeal letter but insisted that diplomats had been misinformed by local court officials in @entity3			1
an @entity8 spokesman said : ' we would like to make it clear that we have not made a “ blunder ” and we did not create a “ mix - up ” during the appeal process			1
' we have worked very hard within the restraints of the local court system to use the processes available to us and have done so as quickly as possible			0

appeal letter on behalf of @entity12 , 56 , rejected after mix - up
sister @entity32 accuses @entity8 of ' incompetence and insensitivity
but plea finally accepted after *agonising* 18 - hour wait
ms @entity32 *reveals* fellow *suspect* @entity12 has made death threats to her sister
