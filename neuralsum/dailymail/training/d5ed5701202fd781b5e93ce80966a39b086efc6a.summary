lingerie brand @entity0 has come under fire for an ' irresponsible ' advert for their new ' push up denim range of bras			1
featuring @entity7 @entity6 , @entity8 and the face of the brands new perfume @entity12 , the ad looks much like the many others released by the brand over the years , with the three sculpted abs , gazelle like legs and perfect white teeth smiling out at us			1
but what has upset many is the wording used across the poster , which states simply ' the @entity24 '			0
the advert features ( l - r ) @entity7 @entity6 , @entity8 and the face of the brands new perfume @entity12 , with the words ' the perfect body ' emblazoned across their taught stomachs it is this implication that the nigh un-achievable figures of the models , who often tower over 5ft 10in , is the ultimate shape for women that has prompted outrage			1
so strong in fact is the strength of feeling about the wording of the advert that a petition has been launched urging the lingerie brand to take it down			1
the campaign on @entity45 was set up by three students @entity46 , @entity48 and @entity49 , who spotted the advert in a shopping centre in @entity52			2
already having garnered over 1,900 signatures already the campaign has also prompted an avalanche of reaction on @entity56 calling on @entity0 to ' apologise for , and amend the irresponsible marketing of your new bra range ' body '' the campaign states that the ad sends out an ' unhealthy and damaging message about women ’s bodies and how they should be judged '			1
already having garnered over 1,900 signatures already the campaign has also prompted an avalanche of reaction on @entity56 , with many criticizing the popular brand for the message it is sending through the advert , which is both on its website and at stores across the @entity71			1
in the impassioned but eloquent post on the petition site the three students state : ' every day women are bombarded with advertisements aimed at making them feel insecure about their bodies , in the hope that they will spend money on products that will supposedly make them happier and more beautiful			0
the petition has garnered huge support , with many echoing the message that the advert promotes an unrealistic body image for girls ( sometimes by posting photos demonstrating their displeasure on social media ) ' all this does is perpetuate low self - esteem among women who are made to feel that their bodies are inadequate and unattractive because they do not fit into a narrow standard of beauty			1
it contributes to a culture that encourages serious health problems such as negative body image and eating disorders			2
' @entity0 ’s new advertisements play on women 's insecurities , and send out a damaging message by positioning the words ' the @entity24 ' across models who have exactly the same , very slim body type			1
' and many of those choosing to sign the petition are echoing these sentiments in the comment section			0
@entity117 writes : ' body shaming is irresponsible and damaging			2
as is setting a specific standard of beauty and perfection			0
as women we need to be encouraged and celebrated in all our appearances and not pigeonholed			0
for male campaigns this can also be an issue that needs adressing			0
' a previous employee of the brand , @entity129 agrees , writing : ' society needs to change the way they view a woman 's appearance			0
as a former @entity0 employee , i know that the company was developed to design lingerie to make women feel better about themselves			2
the marketing team apparently did n't get the memo			0
' the @entity142 contacted @entity0 for a comment but at the time of publication they had not responded .			0
