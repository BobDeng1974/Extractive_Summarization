by @entity0 dr @entity1 has managed to offend not only an innocent couple who phoned in for his help on a recent episode of @entity5 , but also endometriosis sufferers around the country and beyond			1
the reality tv doctor , who has hosted @entity9 and a number of subsequent spin - offs , interrupted his caller as he was explaining that his fiancee had endometriosis , lactose intolerance and interstitial cystitis			1
' these are what we call sort of functional disorders , ' he began			2
' they 're sort of ... they 're what we call " garbage bag disorders , " when you ca n't think of anything else , you go , " eh , well it 's that			2
" ' in hot water : dr @entity1 ( pictured ) has come under fire for labeling endometriosis a ' garbage bag disorder ' while offering advice to a caller on his radio show , @entity5 he then proceeded to suggest that perhaps she was ' visiting doctors all the time ' because she was sexually abused growing up			1
surprisingly , the male caller confirmed that indeed she had been sexually abused , at which point dr @entity1 somewhat triumphantly leapt into his next diatribe			1
' the only way her body , which was suffering during those early experiences , can tell its tale of woe is with pain , ' he says , describing the ' unexplained ' discomfort as ' somatoform dissociation '			0
' she really needs to see a trauma specialist , not a urologist			0
know what i 'm saying ? ' in a shock move , dr @entity1 promptly hung up , giving his caller no opportunity to ask his actual question			1
regretting that now ? dr @entity1 , pictured during the segment on @entity5 in which he made the inflammatory comments , has since semi-apologized amid a fierce backlash @entity66 is defined as the abnormal growth of cells , similar to those that form the inside of the uterus , but in a location outside of the uterus			1
endometriosis can make it more difficult for a woman to conceive a child pelvic pain during menstruation or ovulation can be a symptom of the disorder			2
treatment of endometriosis includes medication and surgery for both pain relief and treatment of infertility if pregnancy is desired			0
the internet was quickly awash with angry respondents , many of whom are sufferers of endometrosis - which is defined by medicinenet.com as ' the abnormal growth of cells , similar to those that form the inside of the uterus , but in a location outside of the uterus			0
' ' how can you call it a garbage bag disorder when the patient has actual positive diagnostic tests ? ' wrote one angry viewer on @entity5 's comment section			1
' did my urologist @entity112 in my bladder ? did my gynecologist doodle in my over growing uterine lining ? ' another wrote : ' i am one of 200 million women with this disorder			1
i miss work every month , @entity123 , friend 's birthdays , parties , etc. it affects every part of my life			2
' indeed , @entity129 , the stunning host of @entity131 's hit show @entity132 , is just one celebrity who has spoken out previously about her very real battle with the disorder			1
' i became very angry at the fact that i personally was only diagnosed with endometriosis at age 36 , ' she said during a tv appearance , describing repeated doctor visits over the course of her life which failed to turn up answers			1
' i thought that the doctors knew better			0
doctors should listen to patients and patients should listen to their own bodies			0
' ms @entity129 subsequently underwent successful excision surgery to remove her endometriosis and went on to have a child			1
she is now the co-founder of the @entity152			0
in response to the negative backlash dr @entity1 received , he offered a sheepish apology on last night 's lifeline			0
he told listeners that he did n't mean that all endometriosis diagnoses were ' garbage ' , just that in the case of that particular caller , it sounded like doctors were searching in vain for an explanation for her pain			2
trouble at home : dr @entity1 's 22 - year - old daughter , @entity171 ( left ) recently revealed she had been struggling with bulimia for seven years , without her father or mother @entity174 ( right ) noticing dr @entity1 's flippant solution to this problem is n't his only public comment to cause a stir			0
in 2010 , when asked for his parenting opinion in the case of troubled star @entity181 , he declared : ' if [ she ] were my daughter , i would pack her car full with illegal substances , send her on her way , call the police , and make sure she was arrested			0
i would make sure she was not allowed to get out of jail			0
' ironically for the man with the iron fist , only this year , his own daughter , 22 - year - old @entity171 , revealed she had been suffering from bulimia for seven years , right under the very nose of her father , who is trained in the field of eating disorders			0
' this condition , like many , is cunning , and hiding and secrecy is a feature of the condition , ' he said of his daughter 's public confession .			2

the reality tv doctor made the comments to a *concerned* caller on his radio show , @entity5
the condition affects roughly 200 million women *worldwide*
@entity129 host @entity129 has spoken previously about ' anger ' that her disorder was not diagnosed until she was 36
