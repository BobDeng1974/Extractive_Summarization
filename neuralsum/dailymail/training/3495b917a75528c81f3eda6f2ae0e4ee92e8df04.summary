@entity1 's frantic rebuilding programme to patch up the inadequate squad left by sir @entity3 has been a major factor in propelling @entity6 spending to record levels for a summer window			1
the combined outlay for the 20 clubs stood at £ 755.9million , even before @entity1 's £ 14m deal to buy @entity12 from @entity13 , subject to medical and personal terms , was announced			1
of that , £ 570m has gone overseas , with @entity16 alone receiving £ 238.7m			1
the arrival of @entity18 will take @entity1 's summer spree to almost £ 150m and sets up a tantalising question with just a few dozen hours of this window remaining			1
will this be a £ 1billion window ? scroll down for @entity25 ' club - by - club guide record : @entity1 paid £ 60million to bring @entity27 to @entity28 from @entity29 bow : @entity30 made his @entity1 debut in the goalless draw at @entity33 on saturday is it possible that these clubs from just one division can spend an average of £ 50m apiece in one transfer period ? and that does include at least the equivalent commitment in wages to the new players			1
already last summer 's @entity6 record spend of £ 630m for one transfer window has been smashed			1
based on last year 's activity , it is possible that the total on the sunday morning before the window closes can leap by about a quarter when the window shuts			0
last summer £ 507m turned to £ 630m at the close of business			2
the same percentage rise will see the £ 1bn figure pushed close			0
conditions this time are even more amenable to a late splurge , as @entity1 and their major rivals bolster their squads in the hope that they will be good enough for top - four finishes - and lucrative @entity63 football - or even genuine title tilts			2
big bucks : @entity66 international @entity65 left @entity67 to join @entity68 in a £ 30million deal decisive : @entity65 celebrates a crucial goal against @entity71 in the @entity63 play - off round the rest of the division are also spending because they need strength in depth to try to stay in the division - and remain on the gravy train			2
that is why @entity1 splashed a @entity82 record fee of £ 59.7m on @entity27 , why @entity83 bought @entity84 and @entity68 bought @entity65 for £ 32m each - and why all three clubs will remain in the market before the window closes			1
@entity88 have splashed out £ 12m for @entity89 , and @entity90 have paid the same for @entity91			0
@entity92 broke their own record to buy £ 28m @entity94 from @entity83 while @entity95 spent £ 8m on @entity96			1
arrivals : £ 20m defender @entity98 is one of many new @entity100 signings this summer shift : @entity98 moved to @entity102 from @entity88 , along with @entity103 and @entity104 splashing the cash : even despite @entity108 restrictions , @entity106 paid @entity109 £ 32m for @entity110 @entity112 manager @entity111 said : ' fees are extremely high			2
we started with a budget that looked good , and very quickly it looked a small budget			0
clearly , there have been huge fees paid for players , huge demands by those players and agents ' fees have been considerable			0
' @entity125 , partner in the @entity126 at @entity127 , attributes the rise in spending to a number of factors			0
they include ' the showcase for talent a @entity135 provides ' and the fact that each @entity6 club received on average £ 25m more central tv cash in 2013 - 14 than they did the season before			1
clinical : @entity83 signed @entity84 from @entity141 in a deal worth £ 32million off and running : @entity84 has scored four goals in his first three games for @entity146 's side but while a number of @entity135 stars from the @entity150 2014 tournament have come to @entity151 , including @entity30 , @entity84 and @entity65 , history shows that there is nothing about a @entity135 year that boosts spending			0
in 2010 , summer trade to @entity6 clubs was substantially down ( £ 365m ) on 2009 ( £ 450m )			1
and in 2006 it was only very marginally up on 2005			0
@entity125 's calculations on tv cash also do n't tell the full story : each club received on average an extra £ 28m in central @entity6 funds in 2013 - 14 , or £ 78m against £ 50m , with £ 26m of this extra being tv cash			2
the big clubs saw bigger leaps ; @entity100 's tv money went up by £ 43m to £ 97.5m , @entity106 's was up by £ 38.5m to £ 96.6m , @entity83 's was up £ 39.1m to £ 94.1m , and clubs like @entity68 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity88 and @entity171 saw rises of £ 30m			0
ultimately , like so many things now in elite football , it comes down to money			0
the clubs have the cash , and they spend it in the hope ( or fear ) that they can do better - and avoid failure			0
familiar face : @entity94 joined @entity92 for £ 28m from @entity83 this summer return : @entity94 spent last season on loan at @entity184 and this summer agreed a permanent switch			2

@entity6 spending already over £ *750million* this summer
record - breaking transfer window will be ended with monday *deadline*
@entity1 have spent nearly £ 150m in their frantic rebuild
@entity27 joined @entity1 for @entity82 record £ 60m fee from @entity29
£ 570m of @entity6 outlay has gone overseas , £ 238.7m to @entity16
