@entity0 insists @entity1 have not given up hope of catching @entity4 leaders @entity5			1
@entity1 's 11 - match unbeaten run came to a shock end on sunday when they lost 1 - 0 to @entity9 at @entity10			1
the defeat meant @entity1 dropped to fourth in the table and @entity14 's men are now some 12 points behind @entity5 , who are two points in front of second - placed @entity18			1
defender @entity0 ( right ) insists that @entity1 are still in the title race @entity1 's 1 - 0 loss to @entity9 leaves them 12 points behind leaders @entity5 @entity1 were so poor on sunday that they failed to muster a single shot on target			1
@entity1 's Â£ 150million four - man attack looked blunt , but @entity0 believes it would be wrong to make a snap judgement on the team 's title aspirations based on sunday 's defeat			1
when asked whether the loss meant it would be hard to catch @entity5 or @entity18 , the @entity1 defender said : ' no. you have seen teams dropping points			1
' i think @entity5 were clear of @entity18 and then two games within the space of a week and they are back in it			1
that 's how football changes			2
' it 's up and down			2
you just never know who is going to drop points			2
' that gives us hope			0
there 's always hope , but we have to worry about ourselves really rather than anyone else			2
' senior sources at @entity10 insisted towards the end of last year that @entity1 had been on an ' upward trajectory ' since @entity53 took over in july			1
but however much he does not like to be told about it , the @entity4 table suggests otherwise			2
@entity57 screams after missing one of two excellent opportunities to score for the @entity60 @entity9 winger @entity61 stripped off to celebrate scoring his winning goal after 21 matches @entity53 has amassed 37 points - the same number as his predecessor @entity66 , who was sacked after 10 months having spent less than half the money his successor has on transfers			1
there is no doubt @entity53 has restored a sense of grandeur and expectation about the club though			0
and when asked whether @entity1 were in a better position to bounce back now compared to last year , @entity0 added : ' yes			1
there 's a lot of confidence still in the dressing room			2
' we have lost the game , the lads are disappointed but you have to move on quickly			0
' you ca n't dwell on these results			0
we have done okay over @entity87			0
' we would have liked to have picked up two more points against @entity89 and @entity90 but now we need to get a bit of a run , ' @entity93 is always a little setback but it 's nothing more than that			1
' we have to look forward to the next game and make sure we get three points			2
we have been on a decent run and we need to go on a new one			0
' @entity101 celebrates after helping @entity5 to open up a two - point lead at the top of the table @entity18 dropped points after being held to a 1 - 1 draw by @entity108 's strike at @entity109 many were surprised to see @entity111 omitted from the @entity1 matchday squad			1
@entity53 's decision to stick with the 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 system despite @entity1 's defensive frailties also drew criticism			1
@entity0 thinks it was always going to be hard for he and his team - mates to adapt to the new system , but the @entity121 centre - back insists he is at ease playing as part of a back three			1
' i think we are comfortable playing in it , ' the 22 - year - old said			0
' it 's a learning curve			0
it does n't just happen overnight			0
you do n't just click your fingers and you are used to playing in a formation			0
' it 's like anything			0
but we are improving in training and we want to get better			0
' we can have a back four or three			0
we are comfortable with both			0
@entity14 's decision to omit @entity111 from the squad has cast doubts over the striker 's future @entity1 reserve keeper @entity143 will spend the rest of the season at @entity146 after a loan at @entity148 ' sometimes maybe we play a pass in the defence when we should n't but we are comfortable playing in both formations the manager has shown			1
' we are still improving as a team			0
' @entity1 , meanwhile , have confirmed backup goalkeeper @entity143 will spend the rest of the season on loan at hometown club @entity146			2
@entity143 was on loan at @entity148 , but the 21 - year - old cut short his spell at the @entity161 club to move to @entity162 , where his father @entity163 played during the 1990s .			0

@entity1 's unbeaten run came to an end against @entity9
the @entity168 are still in the @entity4 title race , insists @entity0
@entity5 lead @entity14 's side by 12 points with @entity18 10 points in front
