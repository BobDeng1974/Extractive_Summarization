@entity0 has hinted he would like to add @entity1 and @entity2 to his @entity4 squad ahead of the new campaign			1
the @entity6 is looking for the perfect players to fit into the attack - minded 3 - 5 - 2 formation he intends to deploy in the @entity10 this season			1
and he suggested the @entity13 winger and the @entity15 wing - back could follow @entity16 and @entity17 in joining @entity4 before the end of the transfer window			1
the player is very familiar with @entity34 's formation after playing under him for @entity39 at the @entity40 ( pictured ) shortlist : @entity34 is likely to make more additions to his @entity4 squad before the end of the month in an exclusive interview with the @entity46 , @entity34 said : ' you can not compare how the players will do under the guidance of @entity50 with those same players under the guidance of @entity0			2
' every trainer and coach and manager wants a different style of play and different tactics			0
' now we have five no 9s and four no 10s and we do n't have wingers to play attacking width , not at the highest level , of @entity65 or @entity1 or something like that			0
so i have to play also in another way and you have seen that			0
' it 's a strategy of @entity4 to buy players who are on the way up and getting better , but i only buy when i think we need to			0
' @entity1 has been linked with a move to @entity36 for some time but @entity4 may have to part with as much as £ 55m to sign him			1
hot property : @entity1 , seen here playing against @entity4 in the @entity77 in 2013 , has been linked with a move to @entity36 for some time but could cost as much as £ 55m getting stuck in : blind challenges @entity81 of @entity82 during a @entity77 tie			1
he has won four league titles at @entity15 as well as helping @entity39 to third place at the @entity40 though @entity2 is not explicitly mentioned , @entity34 knows all about his qualities from his time as @entity39 coach and the player is certainly ' on the way up and getting better			2
' @entity34 also said : ' if they are at the level i want them to be , then i will sign @entity6 players			0
' @entity6 players are usually cheaper than players of other nationalities and they have usually been very well educated in the @entity6 , i believe			0
' blind has a price tag of around £ 15m but @entity34 has been told money is no object as he rebuilds @entity4 after a traumatic season under @entity50			1
different proposition : @entity34 already seems to have got the best out of a squad that flopped under the leadership of @entity50 putting down a marker : @entity108 and @entity109 lift the @entity110 in @entity111 after beating old rivals @entity112 3 - 1 in the final his comments about @entity50 suggest he will get more from the existing squad than his predecessor and this has been evident already in @entity4 's pre-season results			1
they won all five matches on their tour of the @entity122 , lifting the @entity110 by beating @entity112 3 - 1 in the final			2
@entity34 has given every member of the squad a fair chance to show what they can do and most have responded with better performances than last season			0
they will have a final chance to impress when @entity4 host @entity133 on tuesday night before they kick off the new campaign at home to @entity137 on saturday .			0

@entity4 manager hints that he needs players to offer width
@entity13 star @entity1 is mentioned but will cost £ 55m
@entity4 also strongly linked with £ 15m - rated @entity15 wing - back @entity2
@entity34 will *favour* 3 - 5 - 2 formation at @entity36
