by @entity0 @entity2 has brought his coaching partnership with @entity4 to an end , two - and - a - quarter years after the unlikely pair were brought together			1
both parties described the split as mutual and amicable , with the @entity8 wishing his charge all success for the future and declaring that he wished to pursue other projects , such as playing on the @entity13 and running his tennis academy			2
@entity2 found the perfect foil in @entity4 , who like him had struggled to win @entity17 early in his career , and his bolstering presence soon helped him win the @entity20 , the @entity21 and @entity22			1
she is one of the country 's top coaches and taught both @entity2 and brother @entity38 as juniors			2
she is now the captain of @entity42 's @entity41 team			0
@entity44 - @entity2 's dad , he is not as prominent as @entity34 , and juggles running a chain of newsagents in @entity47 with following @entity2			2
@entity48 - @entity2 's girlfriend of eight years			2
she is the daughter of former @entity51 head of women 's tennis @entity52 and was once described by @entity34 as ' the best thing to happen to @entity2 '			2
@entity56 's fitness coach and widely credited for turning him from a skinny youngster to a bulked - up athlete			0
he puts @entity2 through a punishing fitness regime , often in the baking heat of @entity61 , and has him on a strict diet that can often include up to 50 pieces of sushi in one meal			2
@entity67 - a former singles player himself - if only ever reaching number 727 in the world - he has known @entity56 since they were teenagers			0
acted as assistant coach to @entity4 and is @entity2 's regular hitting partner			1
@entity2 , who is preparing to defend his @entity74 title in @entity61 over the next 12 days , said : ' i 'm eternally grateful to @entity4 for all his hard work over the past two years , the most successful of my career so far			1
as a team we have learned a lot and it will definitely be a benefit in future			0
i 'll take some time with the team to consider the next steps			0
' it seems that for now he will work with his permanent on - the - road hitting partner , assistant coach and close friend @entity85 , backed up by his physio and fitness support team			1
although there had been no overt signs of difficulties between @entity2 and @entity4 there have been a few areas of concern opening up since the 26 - year - old @entity97 returned from back surgery , which he underwent at the end of last september			1
@entity4 has always made it clear that he would not travel full - time with @entity2 and has not been with him since the @entity101 , where he made the quarter finals			1
he was absent playing on the senior tour in other cities in @entity105 last week while the @entity106 no 1 , currently down to no 6 in the world , toiled in @entity108 , where he lost in the fourth round to @entity110 in a surprisingly tame deciding set			1
champion : @entity2 was @entity22 winner last summer , defeating @entity112 in the final as highlighted in @entity24 on tuesday , there have been some particularly odd scheduling decisions from the @entity22 champion this season , which has seen him play far more than usual , on occasions seemingly without reference to the bigger picture			1
in the immediate aftermath of wednesday 's surprise announcement , it can only be speculated upon whether this was a source of tension , but clearly the magic has gone out of their relationship somewhere			0
it was always a bold appointment , hiring the idiosyncratic @entity8 who had largely been out of tennis since his retirement and had no prior one - to - one coaching experience			0
yet the decision quickly looked inspired when , having properly hooked up at the @entity136 , @entity2 went on to win the @entity20 championship in september , emulating @entity138			1
@entity4 appeared to have added a missing ingredient of a calm influence on his player before big finals , which had been notably absent before			0
it was born out of his own experience of struggling to win them early on in his own career , before progressing to claim eight of them in all			0
prize guy : the @entity22 victory earned @entity2 the @entity152 award gold standard : @entity2 won gold at the @entity155 , his first major triumph under @entity4 there seemed to be no ill feeling on @entity4 's part as he described @entity56 today as a ' first - class guy			1
i will always be in @entity2 's corner and wish him nothing but great success as he too goes into a new phase of his career			0
' it would appear that @entity2 and @entity4 must have decided on this course of action over the past few days , as the @entity22 champion arrived in @entity61 late last week after his exit from @entity108 and presumably met up with his coach			1
this has shaped up as an important week for @entity2 as he has 1,000 computer points to defend and a failure to do so would mean another hit to his ranking , which has fallen largely as a result of him missing the @entity178 last year and the back end of the season through the surgery			0
after this he will play in the @entity183 for @entity42 against @entity184 - confirmed in wednesday 's statement - and is then set to have an overdue mini break before tackling the clay swing of the @entity188 , starting at the @entity189			0
crashing out : @entity190 exited the recent tournament in @entity108 early although @entity22 take into account previous grass court form when seedings are made , thus helping @entity2 , it would be harmful to his @entity198 title defence if he ends up outside the top four			1
the more general need is for him to regain some proper momentum to his career after the back surgery , which itself appears to have been successful			0
the situation of the so - called @entity206 and their coaching becomes ever more fascinating , and it would be intriguing to see if @entity2 goes for another big name now			2
with @entity4 he set a trend followed by rivals @entity112 and @entity212 , who have hooked up with @entity214 and @entity215 respectively , the latter with excellent results so far .			0
