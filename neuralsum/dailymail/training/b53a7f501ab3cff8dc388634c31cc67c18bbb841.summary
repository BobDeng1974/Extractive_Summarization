the last time @entity0 played against @entity1 at @entity2 he got a ‘ stupid ’ kick from the @entity5 striker which kept him out for five weeks			1
the @entity7 captain returns today and will shake hands with the @entity10 captain on equal terms … although he admits ‘ maybe i will squeeze his a little ! ’ during @entity10 ’s 2009 friendly with @entity7 at @entity2 , @entity0 tangled with @entity1 in the penalty area			1
@entity1 won @entity10 a spot - kick , despite crashing heavily into @entity0 ’s ankle			1
@entity15 scored and @entity10 won 2 - 1 , while the collision meant the end of @entity0 ’s night and a lengthy spell on the sidelines			1
‘ i do n’t understand the referee , ’ he recalls			2
‘ he gives @entity10 a penalty and me a yellow card , but @entity1 makes a stupid , stupid foul and leaves me injured for five weeks			1
i was n’t happy but now everything is ok			2
‘ on the pitch i am very aggressive and i enjoy the fight in physical games , but i do n’t want to kill him			2
’ @entity1 , of course , becomes the newest member of @entity10 ’s 100 - cap club but @entity0 is also celebrating a special milestone			1
the 32 - year - old former @entity47 centre back plays his 81st game for his country , making him their most - capped player			0
and having played against @entity10 twice , he is convinced @entity7 can shock @entity53 ’s men and end up at @entity54 themselves			0
‘ the @entity10 team has changed a lot recently as there are lots of new players , ’ he says			0
‘ these young players are very strong but when you change something it can sometimes become a problem			0
not only has @entity0 plied his trade in @entity10 , he also clashed with @entity66 ( left ) while at @entity67 @entity0 puts a tackle in on @entity70 's @entity69 during a @entity72 qualifying match in 2008 ‘ this @entity10 team do n’t have @entity15 , @entity73 and @entity74			1
i do n’t think they are as strong as last time ( a 1 - 0 win for @entity10 at the @entity77 ) and we might be able to take advantage of their inexperience			2
’ @entity7 , ranked 36 in the world , are second in @entity83 with six points from three games after beating @entity86 at home and @entity88 away — but @entity0 refuses to get carried away			1
‘ we are hopeful of qualification , ’ he says			0
‘ we have a very good team and this new format is really good for us , as more teams can qualify			0
the country is really optimistic after our last two wins and we ’ll have a lot of fans at @entity2			1
there is more pressure on us now , but we are professionals and we like the pressure			0
when there is pressure we play well			0
’ @entity0 is determined to help @entity7 register a first win over @entity10 , but it ’s obvious he has a great affinity with this country			1
in october , @entity7 beat @entity86 to ensure a positive start to their @entity54 qualifying campaign @entity0 fouls @entity108 ( right ) during @entity7 's @entity54 qualifying game against @entity86 ever since he spent the 2007 - 08 season on loan at @entity47 he has come back regularly to visit friends and oversee his business venture — the @entity114 in a @entity116 restaurant in @entity117 , @entity118			1
he even speaks about taking @entity120 lessons once again — ‘ in case i manage @entity47 one day ! ’ but it ’s our football @entity0 really loves and though he now plays for @entity126 side @entity125 he acknowledges the superiority of the @entity128			1
he says : ‘ it is the best in the world			0
i ’m always dreaming of playing there again — but of course i am very happy in @entity133			0
‘ players give so much more than in other leagues			0
the strikers run harder , chasing every ball , and the supporters are fanatical			0
’ indeed , if @entity0 does turn his hand to management in the future , he has plenty of defining moments under his belt from which to draw experience			2
he describes going to the @entity77 as a ‘ childhood dream ’ , and suspects his greatest individual moment might be his headed winner against eventual @entity72 winners @entity133 in 2004 during qualification			0
but when the idea of scoring the winner at @entity2 today is floated his way he responds with a broad smile : ‘ ok , maybe that would be the best moment ’ .			2

@entity0 was injured by @entity1 last time the two sides met
not only was @entity0 sidelined for five weeks , but he gave away a penalty
the @entity26 insists he is not looking for retribution for the incident
@entity0 is confident his @entity26 side can upset the odds at @entity2
