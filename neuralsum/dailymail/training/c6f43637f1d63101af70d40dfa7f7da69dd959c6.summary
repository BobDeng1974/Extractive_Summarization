by @entity0 more than 5000 parents have voiced their opposition to the @entity4 's draft report on @entity5 , in which recommendations suggest a significant reduction in support funds for middle - income earning families			2
the @entity11 , a non-profit national parent advocacy group , launched a national video campaign on tuesday , rebuking the proposals which they claim could force many women out of the workforce			1
under the current scheme , the government pays for 50 per cent of a family 's early childhood education and care costs , with a cap of $ 7500 per child per year			1
if passed , it would see families earning $ 60,000 or less a year have 90 per cent of their childcare costs subsidised by the government , while those earning more would receive a calculated reduced subsid - caped at 30 per cent for families with incomes of $ 300,000 a year or more			1
the @entity11 says this means families with an income of $ 160,000 a year will have their support greatly reduced , greatly affecting their ability to afford basic childcare services			1
featuring real mothers , the add argues that the proposed government assistance cuts would greatly limit women 's options in the workforce and force many to either leave their jobs or greatly reduce their hours a survey they conducted of 1100 parents , found that 75 per cent of respondents ' would stop work or reduce their hours significantly if the rebate was cut '			1
their black and white video features real mothers , dressed in 1950s styled clothes and chained to household tasks such as ironing and sweeping , while calling for people to support the 50 per cent childcare rebate			0
' if you cut the childcare rebate you take @entity66 back to the1950s where women had no choice about whether they could go to work or not			2
their choice was non ‐ existent , ' @entity70 , the executive director of @entity11 , said			0
the report itself disputes this , suggesting that the proposed changes would lead the number of mothers in employment to rise : ' by around 2.7 per cent , or 46 700 mothers ' ' if you take away a woman 's choice to be able to go to work you chain them to the home			0
the impacts on @entity66 society will be far - ­ reaching			0
' we will see the return of an army of women kept in the home because the choice for them to be able to re- ­ enter the paid workforce has been ripped away			0
' on the contrary , the report suggests that the proposed changes would lead to more opportunity for mothers to enter the workforce , saying : ' the number of mothers in employment is expected to rise by around 2.7 per cent , or 46 700 mothers , ' if the recommended changes take place .			0
