by @entity0 last updated at 9:09 pm on 9th december 2011 given the scenes witnessed at the world ’s largest train station this morning , anyone would have thought these people were on an emotional pilgrimage somewhere			1
well , some certainly were			0
@entity8 ’s new 23,000 sq ft flagship store at @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , opened to great fanfare today as staff cheered enthusiasts who queued up for hours to be the first customers inside			1
some fanatics had travelled almost 3,000 miles to make it and were rewarded as the first 4,000 people through the door received an exclusive t - shirt that reads : ‘ @entity22 , @entity10 ’			1
the 19 - year - old travelled 150 miles from @entity39 , @entity12 , to get to the front of the queue			2
‘ he ’s my son and he ’s an @entity8 fanatic , ’ his father @entity42 , who had joined him waiting for more than 24 hours , told @entity44			2

’ but mr @entity36 did not make the longest trip			0
second in line was @entity52 , who flew an astonishing 2,900 miles from @entity53 , @entity54 , and has visited @entity8 stores around the world , reported @entity57			1
it consultant @entity58 , who works near @entity10 , said he was moved by the cheering crowd as the store opened and thought of the late @entity8 founder @entity62 , who died in october			1
through the doors : some fanatics had travelled 3,000 miles to make it to the store opening in @entity11 fun : @entity68 , 9 , of @entity12 , plays with an iphone on the opening day of the new @entity8 store ‘ i could barely hold back my emotions coming up the stairs , ’ mr @entity58 told @entity57			1
the store has two ‘ @entity76 ’ for technological help , 315 staff employed and a personal collection area for pick - ups			1
' he ’s my son and he ’s an @entity8 fanatic			2
he loves the machines and he even gave me one for @entity49 ' @entity83 the store opened at 10am on friday morning and by 11am there were 1,000 people who had made it inside , with another 500 queued up			1
around 4,000 had got in by 12:30 , reported @entity88			0
the owner of the space , the @entity89 , which runs the city 's bus and subway system , says @entity8 is paying $ 180 per square foot for its lease			2
this is slightly less than the $ 200 - per - square - foot top rate at the century - old transport hub			0
assistance : customers shop for @entity8 products on the opening day of the new store on friday in @entity12 impressive : people walk through the new @entity22 at @entity33 , which overlooks the main concourse of the historic terminal and will become @entity8 's new flagship store in @entity12 by leasing to @entity8 , the @entity89 says it is quadrupling the rent for @entity10 's east balcony and an adjacent one overlooking the cavernous main concourse with its famed night - sky ceiling			1
' i could barely hold back my emotions coming up the stairs ' @entity58 the store includes a basement storage area that was never leased before			0
the transit agency says the draw of the @entity8 name promises to increase foot traffic to other businesses at the terminal			2
@entity8 is behind iconic products such as the @entity124 , the @entity125 and the @entity126 - and has set up in a station that is visited by about 750,000 people daily and home to the @entity131 commuter line			1
the company signed a 10 - year lease with the @entity89 for the space once occupied by @entity137 's @entity136 restaurant , which got $ 5million from @entity8 to clear out early			1
all new : the store features two @entity76 , 15 - minute @entity139 for commuters on a tighter schedule and will employ 315 people say cheese : a customer poses next to an @entity8 logo as he visits the newest @entity22 during its opening on the @entity147 in the main lobby of @entity12 's grand central station @entity89 says the $ 180 - per - square - foot cost reflects this $ 5million payment , plus @entity8 's $ 2.5million capital investment in the space and a $ 1.1million annual rate that will rise each year of the lease			1
@entity8 is making it easier than ever to spend money at the new store in @entity10			1

' it 's all about putting the customer in charge , ' an @entity8 spokesman said confidently			2
the store also offers one feature not available at any other @entity22 - 15 - minute training sessions for rushed @entity12			0
@entity8 will not share any portion of its revenue with the @entity89 , as other retailers do at the terminal , and it is considered by the transport group as an ‘ anchor tenant ’ at @entity10			0
this is equivalent to a prominent store in a shopping centre that serves as an attraction surrounded by smaller retailers			0
