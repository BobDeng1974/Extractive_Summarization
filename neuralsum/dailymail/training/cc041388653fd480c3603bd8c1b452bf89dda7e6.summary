by @entity0 published : 17:55 est , 13 august 2012 updated : 17:59 est , 13 august 2012 one of the oldest women in @entity2 received a long - overdue benefit bump after the survivor payments she from her deceased husband ’s wwi service went from $ 36 per month to $ 1,000			1
because of her diligent son who spent years trying to get @entity12 ’s veteran ’s benefits increased , the 110 - year - old woman got a significant boost to her bank account			1
mrs @entity17 ’ husband @entity16 served in the @entity18 during @entity19 and was stationed in @entity20 and @entity21 ‘ because they had some skirmishes down there , ’ his son @entity15 told @entity24			1
happy couple : @entity26 married @entity12 before he served in the @entity27 during @entity19 and when he died at the age of 81 in 1976 , she began receiving his veteran 's benefits which were $ 36 - per - month back in time : @entity12 's husband @entity16 served as in the @entity33 during @entity19 and his son says that he was stationed in @entity20 and @entity21 because ' there were some skirmishes down there ' at the time when mr @entity26 died when he was 81 - years - old in 1976 , that is when his widow @entity12 began receiving his veterans benefits			1
at the time , those benefits were set at $ 36 per month			1
those benefits provided some help to ms @entity17 initially , as the cost of living was much lower and the former teacher was living by herself in a trailer for many years			2
when she turned 106 - years - old , her son moved her into @entity48 nursing home and he says that though she just turned 110 last week earning her the title of one of the top three oldest women in @entity2 , she is still in good health			2
‘ she still feeds herself and uses a walker to get around			0
she subscribes to @entity54 and reads that all the time , ’ @entity15 , 73 , said			0
family support : @entity12 and @entity16 had two children , @entity16 ( far right ) who has since died and @entity15 ( far left ) who is now 73 - years - old and has pushed for his mother 's benefits to be increased though she is comfortable , that has little to do with the minimal veterans benefits which have clearly not kept up with inflation			1
in 2008 , @entity15 first sent a letter to the office of veteran ’s affairs in hopes of increasing their monthly pay out , but he heard little back and ‘ just got form letters every month for years ’			1
after seeing a television ad for congressman @entity72 which touted the work he did for senior citizens , the dutiful son called his office and inquired about getting some help to move the issue up the ladder			2
six weeks later , the monthly check was raised without notice from $ 36 to $ 1,000			1
now mrs @entity17 will receive an additional $ 25,000 in back benefits starting from the date of @entity15 ’s first 2008 inquiry			0
‘ if i ’d have known i would have applied much sooner , ’ he told @entity24			0
today : @entity15 joins his mother @entity12 in @entity87 nursing home , and she turned 110 last week together for decades : @entity12 was a schoolteacher in a one - room school and @entity16 returned home from @entity19 and became a barber though the sudden check increase stunned @entity15 , it still has n’t quite sunk in for his mother , who used to be a teacher in a one - room schoolhouse that was heated only by a potbelly stove			1
‘ at her age , she did n’t quite believe it and she does n’t realize how much her nursing home and care costs , ’ he said			0
@entity103 congressman @entity72 , who represents @entity2 ’s 12th district , told the local paper that his office was happy to help			0
‘ it is really just an awesome outcome , ’ he told @entity107			0
he posted the story on his @entity112 page and urged other seniors to seek assistance if they were not receiving the benefits that they deserved			0
‘ you ca n’t help but feel like mr @entity26 found a way to say “ @entity118 ” to his wife and just had my office deliver the card			0
’ though mrs @entity17 herself is a self - described @entity124 , who fondly remembers the time she was able to serve coffee to then - vice president @entity128 , mr @entity72 has found a fan in her son who will have to contribute less every month to his mother ’s expenses because of the benefit increase			2
‘ i ’m independent so i could n’t vote for him in the primaries but i will certainly be voting for him now ! ’ @entity15 said of congressman @entity72 .			0

@entity12 's husband @entity16 served in the @entity138
he died in 1976 and she began receiving his veteran 's pension which was set at $ 36 - per - month
their son *contacted* veteran 's affairs for years hoping to get it increased
