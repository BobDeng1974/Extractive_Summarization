the @entity0 called for ' reassurance ' from the @entity14 and medical authorities that occasional binges would not mean an unborn child will be damaged			1
the appeal follows years of warnings from medical organisations and the @entity21 that women who drink alcohol during pregnancy can put their baby 's health at risk			1

' a report from @entity0 said : ' warnings that even one episode of binge drinking by a pregnant woman can cause lifelong damage to her baby are causing serious and unnecessary distress			1
' we are now regularly seeing women so concerned that they have harmed their baby before they knew they were pregnant they consider ending what would otherwise be a wanted pregnancy			2
' the report said occasional binge drinking is a ' fact of life ' and added : ' inevitably this means significant numbers of women will have drunk fairly heavily before finding out they were pregnant			2
' warnings that even small quantities of alcohol can lead to birth defects , facial deformities and learning difficulties can cause deep anxiety among this group of women , who are increasingly seeking advice from @entity0 about whether to continue or end the pregnancy			1

another 5 per cent of all pregnant women with diabetes were on statins and 2.5 per cent were on high blood pressure pills			0
