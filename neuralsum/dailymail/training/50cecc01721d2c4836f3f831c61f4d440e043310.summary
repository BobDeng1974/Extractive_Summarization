culture secretary @entity0 should be thrown out of the @entity1 and be forced to give up her commons seat as punishment for making false expenses claims , according to a @entity6 poll			1
voters also want the embattled minister to be stripped of her role in charge of introducing new press curbs following @entity13 ’s inquiry into media ethics			1
the damning findings come from the first survey conducted since mrs @entity0 was forced to pay back £ 5,800 over-claimed on her mortgage and apologise to the @entity18 on thursday			1
damning verdict : @entity0 ( pictured making her apology on thursday ) should be thrown out of the @entity1 and be forced to give up her commons seat after making false expenses claims , says a @entity6 poll the results will pile pressure on @entity25 to do a u-turn over his refusal to sack her			1
a senior @entity30 mp said last night that mrs @entity0 was ‘ dead in the water , politically speaking ’ – and certain to be ditched in a @entity1 reshuffle before the summer			1
‘ it is natural for the pm to stand by her for now , but she will be gone by the party conference , ’ said the mp			0
a total of 78 per cent of those polled by @entity38 for @entity6 say mrs @entity0 should lose her @entity1 seat			1
' a ridiculous claim ' : the house in @entity42 , @entity43 , that @entity44 listed as her primary residence ominously , the number of @entity47 who think she should be fired as @entity0 is 82 per cent			2
only one in ten say she should stay in the @entity1			2
the survey also emphasises that , five years after the @entity54 ’ expenses scandal erupted , public fury over politicians thought to be ‘ on the fiddle ’ is as intense as ever			2
humiliatingly , most people believe that kicking mrs @entity0 out of the @entity1 is not sufficient retribution : nearly seven out of ten say she should be made to quit as the mp for @entity42			1
pressurised : the results will pile pressure on @entity25 to do a u-turn over his refusal to sack her defiant mr @entity25 ’s decision to stand by her gets the thumbs - down from three - quarters of voters			1

fewer than one in five say she should stay in control of the issue			0
mrs @entity0 ’s 32 - second @entity18 apology left voters deeply unimpressed – nearly three - quarters say her statement was inadequate			1

mrs @entity0 listed her primary residence as a rented home in her @entity43 constituency			1
as part of a series of emails to standards commissioner @entity96 , the @entity0 even threatened to report her to the @entity18 ’ @entity97 if she did not conclude the inquiry , and branded one line of questioning from mrs @entity96 as ‘ unwarranted and wrong ’			1
the @entity0 ’s adviser @entity100 was accused of trying to ‘ flag up ’ mrs @entity0 ’s key role in stricter press regulation in a bid to suppress coverage of the affair – a claim ms @entity100 rejects			1
no 10 has also denied trying to threaten a newspaper investigating the minister ’s expenses with tougher regulation of the press			2
formal apology : @entity0 's 32 - second apology to the @entity18 on thursday was appalling , writes mr @entity115 making a statement : it was written all over the @entity0 's face that she did n't want to do it , he adds mrs @entity0 was last week forced to apologise after a 16 - month investigation			1
the @entity97 was scathing about her attitude to the inquiry , accusing her of taking a ‘ legalistic ’ approach and providing a ‘ totally inadequate response ’ to one of mrs @entity96 ’s inquiries			0
but controversially , it over-ruled mrs @entity96 ’s insistence that mrs @entity0 repay almost £ 45,000 of the £ 90,000 allowances she claimed over four years , claiming she had acted ‘ reasonably ’ in declaring the @entity88 property as her second home			1
it said she should only repay £ 5,800 overclaimed in mortgage interest in 2009			0
political figures : deputy prime minister @entity133 ( right ) declined to come to mr @entity25 's aid over the issue yesterday , but conservative chairman @entity136 ( left ) said it was time to ' draw a line ' under the controversy deputy prime minister @entity133 declined to come to mr @entity25 ’s aid over the issue yesterday , saying : ‘ all the issues to do with her position and indeed to do with the behaviour of her office , alleged or not , is entirely a matter for the prime minister			2
’ but @entity30 chairman @entity136 said it was time to ‘ draw a line ’ under the controversy			2
@entity38 questioned 1,001 voters on friday			0
' i ca n't see @entity0 changing ' : @entity115 is mrs @entity0 's former campaign organiser years before @entity0 ’s dodgy expenses were reported in the media , i tried to bring it to the public ’s attention			1
i noticed it soon after i started working on her campaign that resulted in her being elected mp for @entity42 in 2005			0
i came to realise that she is the sort who claims for everything			0
it ’s part of what i call ‘ @entity0 ’s culture ’			2
she would even claim for parking in her own constituency			0
as for her insistence that the house in @entity87 was her second home – thus allowing her to claim expenses on it – i thought it was ridiculous because she seemed to spend as little time as possible in @entity42			0
from what i could see , her family were based in @entity87			0
i tried to raise my concerns with @entity30 officials but they did n’t want to know			2
in my view , the @entity181 got it right but @entity54 let her off the hook			0
it was a stitch - up			0
talking to people in cafes around @entity42 yesterday , they were saying : ‘ she ’s got away with it			0

and i know that arrogant look so well			0
it says : ‘ i ’m right and everyone else is wrong			0
how dare anybody question me			0
do n’t you know who i am ? ’ but the people of @entity42 are saying : ‘ hang on a minute			0
never mind apologising to mps , what about apologising to us , and what about apologising for taking public money that you are n’t entitled to ? ’ ' @entity0 's culture ' : mrs @entity0 claims for everything , even for parking in her own constituency , says mr @entity115 i ca n’t see @entity0 changing			1
she has no truck with criticism locally and heaven help anyone like me who has the temerity to question her word			0
nobody complains about @entity0 – not if they want to stay a conservative , as i found out			2
it was like i dared to say the @entity221 was not a virgin ! even though i helped her win a majority in 2005 of more than 4,500 , on election day itself she was ranting and raving and thought she was going to lose			2
' arrogant look ' : mr @entity115 says he was ' so appalled ' by mrs @entity0 's behaviour that he voted for her @entity229 rival even though he was effectively her campaign manager at the time			1
above , mrs @entity0 outside @entity231 i told her to get out of the room , saying that we would get her elected , and that she should leave everybody else alone			1
i was so appalled by her behaviour , i voted for her @entity229 rival even though i was effectively her campaign manager and i was a @entity30 councillor at the time			0

it was the best thing i ever did .			0
