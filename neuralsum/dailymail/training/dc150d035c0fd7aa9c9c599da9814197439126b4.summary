@entity0 wants @entity1 in power because voters are more likely to opt to stay in the @entity4 if a referendum takes place under @entity7 , senior party figures admit			1
two @entity0 sources have conceded privately that they would prefer @entity10 to win the next election , since they believe that would maximise the chances of @entity14 exiting the @entity4			1
the prospect of people voting out would be increased under an unpopular , @entity10 prime minister who has shown little interest in reform of @entity14 ’s relationship with @entity22 , one said			2
’ @entity0 has made strenuous efforts in recent months to claim that it now poses an equal threat to @entity10 and conservative prospects at next year ’s general election			1
pollsters agree , however , that a @entity0 surge is likely to hand @entity10 victory over the conservatives in a string of marginal seats and increase the chances of mr @entity1 entering @entity46			1
mr @entity7 has promised to hold an in / out referendum on @entity14 ’s place in the @entity4 , but made it clear he aims to renegotiate a looser relationship with @entity22 and wants the @entity14 to stay in if reform can be achieved			2
@entity52 fear a repeat of the @entity47 , in which an offer of a transfer of powers to @entity57 , a campaign by the three main @entity60 parties and warnings from business leaders about the dangers of breaking away combined to deliver a vote for the status quo			0
mr @entity1 has effectively ruled out holding an @entity4 referendum , but @entity0 believes he will either be forced to concede one if he becomes prime minister or face a popular uprising that would see its support increase further			2
one conservative cabinet minister said : ‘ those people in @entity0 who want to get @entity14 out of the @entity4 above all else pretend they want a referendum , but actually they will do anything it can to stop one happening after renegotiation under @entity7			1
’ @entity0 leader @entity24 suggested over the weekend that if his party gains enough mps to hold the balance of power in next may ’s general election , it would demand a vote on @entity4 membership by the end of july – before any renegotiation of powers could take place			1
he said his price to prop up a government led by another party would be ‘ a full free and fair referendum on our continued membership of the @entity4 ’			2
‘ i do n't see any reason why that referendum could not take place before the august break , ’ he said			0
many in @entity0 want @entity1 to be prime minister - because people would be more likely to leave the @entity4 yesterday it emerged that the second byelection triggered by a @entity100 mp defecting to @entity0 will be held on november 20			1
following the defection of @entity102 , the @entity42 are to select one of two shortlisted women candidates in a postal ballot open to all residents in @entity107 and @entity108 , @entity109			0
they are @entity110 , a marine surveyor and daughter of a boat builder ; and @entity114 , a former barrister			0
both women are local councillors			0
the @entity116 appear to be hoping to capitalise on @entity0 ’s significant ‘ women problem ’ by opting for a female candidate			1
polls in @entity120 and @entity121 , the @entity123 seat where @entity0 ran @entity10 close in a byelection last week , suggested that the @entity52 party had a narrow lead among male voters but nearly 40 points behind among women			1
mr @entity7 , who is expected to campaign in the seat later this week , said yesterday the postal ballot would put residents in the constituency ‘ in the driver ’s seat ’			2
‘ @entity24 and @entity102 want to turn this election into a national media circus – we want it to be about you and what you want for the future of this area , ’ he said in a letter to local voters			0
‘ the decision is in your hands			0
there ’s no stunts or backroom deals , just a strong local candidate you can trust			0
’ earlier , mr @entity7 admitted that @entity0 is ‘ seductive ’ to voters who have seen living standards squeezed			1
‘ we 've had a very tough time in @entity14			0
people have n't seen pay rises or living standard rises , often for year after year , you 've got @entity164 looking like the source of our problems rather than the source of opportunity , immigration has been too high , there 's been a coalition which not everyone has liked , ’ he told @entity155 ’s @entity154			0
( @entity171 ) the prime minister said the ‘ simple answers ’ being offered by mr @entity24 had ‘ become quite seductive ’ , but warned voting for the party in the general election would mean mr @entity1 gaining power			2
last night , mr @entity7 told a private meeting of conservative mps they had been ‘ lied to ’ repeatedly by mr @entity102 , who denied he was planning to defect to @entity0			1
he ordered an extraordinary effort to try to hold onto the seat in the byelection next month – telling cabinet ministers they would be expected to campaign there at least five times before polling day , with backbench mps told to go at least three times			0
mr @entity7 also repeated his commitment to demanding reforms of @entity4 freedom of movement rules as part of his planned renegotiation of @entity14 ’s relationship with @entity22 .			0

@entity0 have conceded privately they would prefer @entity10 to win next election
party thinks a @entity200 less likely to win a referendum than @entity7
@entity0 claims it now poses an equal threat to @entity10 and @entity100
but pollsters say a @entity0 surge is likely to hand @entity10 victory over @entity116
