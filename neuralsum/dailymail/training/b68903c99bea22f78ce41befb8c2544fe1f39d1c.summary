bad reaction : @entity1 , 13 , began to experience extreme exhaustion soon after having the cervical cancer vaccine alongside classmates which her parents are convinced caused it they were told the vaccine had few side - effects and would protect their daughter from cervical cancer			1
but @entity13 and @entity14 are convinced the controversial @entity16 jab is behind their daughter @entity10 ’s mystery illness which is making her sleep up to 23 hours a day			1
tests have so far ruled out a brain tumour and glandular fever and the 13 - year - old ’s paediatric consultant is investigating potential links with the vaccine @entity26			1
the jab was used in a national vaccination programme which started in september 2008			1
but it has already been linked to several cases of girls displaying severe side - effects			1
before she received the vaccine , @entity10 was perfectly healthy , had an excellent school attendance record and was among the top students in her year			1
but just weeks after she received the third dose of @entity26 in may this year she began to feel exhausted			1
by july she had lost a stone in weight and was sleeping almost round - the - clock			2
‘ some nights i ’ve been so worried that i wake several times to make sure she ’s still breathing , ’ said her mother			1
‘ i was concerned about the potential side - effects because @entity10 had a severe reaction from the @entity48 vaccine			1
‘ but i was reassured by the school nurse that side - effects were extremely unlikely			1
we feel betrayed because , like most parents , we trust the health authorities with our children ’s lives			1
’ mr @entity56 , a health and safety manager at the @entity59 tyre factory in @entity60 , said : ‘ we are desperate to find some sort of treatment which will give us back the daughter we had before			2
almost all cases of cervical cancer start off as an hpv infection			2
80 per cent of women will contract a form of @entity16 by the time they reach 50 , most forms are harmless			2
‘ we have to keep hoping that recovery will be soon			2
’ the vaccine is given to girls aged 12 and 13 in a nationwide programme which followed clinical trials in 2005 on more than 18,000 women under 26			1
parents who do not wish their daughters to have it must opt out			1
the vaccine is most effective when given to girls before they become sexually active			1
in the first year of the nationwide vaccination programme more than 2,000 girls in the @entity84 had health problems after being given the jab			1
@entity90 , from pressure group @entity88 , called for the vaccine to be abandoned until it can be established beyond doubt that it is safe			1
she said : ‘ there have been some real horror stories			2
after the injection , suddenly they ’ve got things like chronic fatigue syndrome			2
’ a spokesman for @entity26 ’s manufacturers , @entity102 , said the company took reports of adverse reactions very seriously and added : ‘ the @entity84 medicines safety agency regularly reviews all suspected adverse events and had concluded that no new or serious risks have been identified during the use of @entity26 in the @entity84 and that the balance of benefits and risks remains positive			1
’ @entity113 , director of @entity115 ’s @entity114 , said : ‘ if year on year take - up of the vaccine continues to be around 80 per cent the incidence of cervical cancer could be reduced by two - thirds in women under 30 by 2025			1
’ her parents fear it could be years before she recovers			1
they now care for @entity10 - who has lost nearly three stone - around the clock and describe their lives as a ' living nightmare '			2
the couple , from @entity60 , @entity131 , are urging parents to find out about the potential side effects of the vaccine , @entity26			1
their warning comes as thousands of year eight pupils prepare to receive the vaccine in schools			1
mrs @entity1 said : ' i would not wish what we 've been through on anyone			1
' i 've not seen the whites of @entity10 's eyes for weeks and nobody can tell us when it will turn			2
' i would urge parents to get all the facts , gather as much information as you can			2
decide for yourself if it 's right for your child			0
' constant care : @entity10 's parents now attend her every need and one of them is always nearby			2
she is pictured with her sister @entity157 , 12 , ( left ) who was recently offered the injection would you let your daughter have the @entity16 injection ? would you let your daughter have the @entity16 injection ? now share your opinion she added : ' i could put up with the constant sleep			0
i believe her body needs it			0
' but it 's the fact that to me she 's in a waking coma , with no treatment			0
' at first we did n't pay any major attention to it			0
we were only aware there was something seriously wrong this july			0
' @entity10 , a bright scholar at @entity178 with a gift for maths , had her third and final instalment of the vaccine in may			2
soon afterwards , she started displaying signs of exhaustion			0
' then she got up one weekend , ' said mrs @entity1			1
' she shouted for me , she was too exhausted to stand			0
' initially , @entity10 's gp found her spleen and liver were enlarged			0
then , after the teenager collapsed in the doctor 's waiting room , she was taken to @entity60 's @entity192			0
she was submitted to a barrage of tests over the weeks to come , including those for glandular fever and a brain tumour			0
but these failed to find any cause			0
coping mechanism : @entity56 trawls the internet for cures later in the summer , @entity10 was again admitted to hospital			0
this time she was unable to walk at all			1
mr @entity56 said : ' she had been able to limp from the settee to the toilet herself			0
' but suddenly she could n't take a single step			0
she lost her balance , her arms and legs were failing			0
' we got a letter from the consultant at the hospital			0
it says it 's quite possible that this might turn out to be a reaction to the hpv vaccine			2
' mrs @entity1 , who gets up to her daughter through the night , said : ' at one stage i thought she was going to die in her sleep			1
' recently , the family installed a stairlift to take @entity10 from her bed to the living room sofa			0
' i bring her downstairs because she 's part of the family , ' said mrs @entity1			1
' i want her down here and hope that subconsciously she can hear something of what 's going on			0
' they have rigged up an electric bell which @entity10 presses when she needs pain relief			0
' she can whisper five words , ' said mr @entity56 , who uses a microphone to help make out @entity10 's barely audible syllables			2
' she says " hurting , toilet , tablet , water " and , most of all , " mum "			0
' mr and mrs @entity244 feed their daughter her lunch and dinner			0
meals must consist of soft food , because chewing takes precious energy			0
the couple said doctors are now 95 per cent sure @entity10 's diagnosis of @entity257 ( @entity258 ) is correct			0
mrs @entity1 has revisited the decision to allow @entity10 to have the vaccine many times			1
' i have regrets , ' she said			0
' but it 's no good having them because you ca n't change what we 've got			0
hindsight is a marvellous thing			0
' though neither has any criticisms of the local vaccination programme , @entity243 and mrs @entity1 are now urging parents to make sure they have as much information as possible before making a decision			1
' talk to people about it , ' said mrs @entity1			1
' you decide , not the government , whether it 's right for your child			0
the @entity281 initiated its @entity16 immunisation programme in september 2008			0
the @entity16 jab is available on the @entity281 to those aged between 12 and 13 years old			2
many are immunised at school			2
vaccines are delivered in three shots over six months			0
they do not have any therapeutic effect on existing hpv infections or cervical lesions which is why girls are vaccinated before they become sexually active			0
the vaccine cuts the risk of cervical cancer by about 70 per cent of the four million vaccinations carried out over the programme 's first two years , there were 4,445 reported side effects			1
none of the deaths or serious health problems which have followed immunisation has been directly linked to the vaccine - but it has been known to trigger undetected health problems			1
some critics also believe that the @entity16 injection can give teenagers a false sense of security , encouraging them to be more sexually active because they no longer have to fear cervical cancer .			0

@entity1 is unable to walk or talk after having injections at school
parents warn others to check on potential side effects of @entity26 vaccine
the *headline* has been *amended* to make clear it *reflects* only an *allegation* that ms @entity326 ' illness was linked to the jab .
