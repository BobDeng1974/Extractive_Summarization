by @entity0 robots may have the upper hand when completing complex , repetitive tasks – but when it comes to human interaction , they still have a lot to learn			1
now one droid , named @entity8 , is hoping to change all that by copying the body language of humans to get people to do exactly what he wants			1
standing at five feet ( 152cm ) tall , with two large arms that mimic the range of motion of a human arm , @entity8 has now mastered the task of handing an object to someone			1
pictured is @entity28 , a phd student in the @entity29 at @entity30 with @entity8 the $ 400,000 ( $ 238,000 ) humanoid robot , picks up a water bottle , briefly glances at the drink and then extends the bottle , with its two camera eyes rising to meet the gaze of the human			1
it might sound like a simple task , but the two - second act is the result of months of painstaking research and programming			0
past studies have shown that people have difficulty figuring out when to reach out and take an object from a robot because droids fail to provide appropriate nonverbal cues			1
‘ we hand things to other people multiple times a day and we do it seamlessly , ’ said @entity28 , a phd student at the @entity52 in @entity53			0
school can be a daunting place for children with autism – with many struggling to communicate with peers and stay focused			0
but one school think they have found a solution – robot teachers			0
@entity66 in @entity67 is the first in the country to use humanoid robots to help teach pupils with autism			0
the knee - high machines , which are designed to move in the same way as children , can be programmed to have conversations , play games , dance and even take classes			2
but unlike human teachers , @entity80 and @entity81 have blank features , no emotions and standardised expressions and responses			0
it is this , according to head teacher , @entity88 that makes the robots much easier for autistic to children to relate to and understand			0
‘ getting this to work between a robot and a person is really important if we want robots to be helpful in fetching us things in our homes or at work			2
’ ms @entity28 and her colleagues studied what people do with their heads , necks and eyes when they hand water bottles to one another			0
they then tested three variations of this interaction with @entity8 and the 102 study participants			1
programming @entity8 to use eye gaze as a nonverbal cue made the handover more fluid			2
researchers found that people reached out to take the water bottle sooner in scenarios where the robot moved its head to look at the area where it would hand over the water bottle			2
people also took the cue to reach out for the bottle when @entity8 looked to the handover location and then up at the person to make eye contact			1
understanding the human - robot interaction could inform everything from rehabilitation for ailments like stroke applications such as factory production and manufacturing			1
‘ we want the robot to communicate using the cues that people already recognise , ’ said ms @entity28			0
‘ this is key to interacting with a robot in a safe and friendly manner			0
’ standing at five feet ( 152cm ) tall , with two large arms that mimic the range of motion of a human arm , @entity8 has now mastered the task of handing an object to someone			1

humans have difficulty knowing when to reach for an object from robots
this is because droids fail to provide appropriate nonverbal cues
@entity8 has been programmed to pick up a bottle , briefly glance at the drink and then extend it , with its two camera eyes rising to meet the human
understanding the human - robot interaction could help develop better droids for everything from medical rehabilitation to manufacturing
