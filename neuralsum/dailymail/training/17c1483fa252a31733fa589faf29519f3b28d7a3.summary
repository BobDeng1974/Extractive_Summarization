by @entity0 published : 20:02 est , 4 april 2013 updated : 09:10 est , 5 april 2013 on the basis , presumably , that if you ca n’t beat them , join them , elders from the @entity3 church have paid for three full - page ads in the programme for the new hit @entity9 show @entity10			1
which is somewhat surprising , considering that from start to finish the bad - taste musical mercilessly lampoons the @entity14 , whose devotees famously include @entity17			1
clearly , they have taken the ‘ any publicity is good publicity ’ route and hitched their wagon to this unstoppable juggernaut			2
@entity10 has been lauded by most critics			2
pictured in white shirts is @entity25 ( centre ) and @entity27 ( back right ) the crude show has broken box office records in the @entity9 tickets for the foul - mouthed show , which makes fun of raping babies and female genital mutilation , are like gold dust			1
already , it has broken @entity9 box office records , taking more than £ 2 million in advance bookings in a single day , following its official opening at the end of last month			1
the sales record was broken after producers released a further 150,000 tickets			1
even so , it is now almost impossible to find a spare seat through official channels until july			2
meanwhile , unofficial websites are selling a pair of tickets for later this month for a staggering £ 750			1
already , the run has been extended until january and the @entity53 pr agency hired by the show ’s @entity55 producers , let slip to me this week they are looking to emulate another @entity9 hit , we will rock you , which has been running for 11 years			1
and the touts are not the only ones cashing in			2
the @entity65 theatre , where @entity10 is showing , has just put up its prices because of the high demand — with the best seats going for £ 72.50			2
at the same time , highbrow critics are falling over themselves to find ever more fawning superlatives for the musical , which has won nine @entity72 on @entity73			2
one hyperventilating female reviewer from the @entity75 wrote : ‘ it ’s simply a work of genius , so brilliantly conceived and executed that it makes astonishingly savage and sophisticated satire into joyous , hilarious , literally all - singing , all - dancing fun and glamour			2
and the @entity83 ’s critic trilled that it is : ‘ the most cryingly good night out to have come along in years			2
’ not everyone agrees , however			2
the @entity87 ’s @entity86 described the show , which follows two clean - cut @entity3 missionaries sent to poverty - stricken @entity90 , as ‘ cowardly , coarse and cynical ’			1
and @entity92 in the @entity93 wrote : ‘ beneath its jollity , [ @entity3 ] is morally null and — without seeming to notice it — pretty racist			2
’ one undeniable thing is that @entity10 — written by the @entity55 creators of equally controversial adult television cartoon @entity98 — is fast becoming the most hyped show in theatre history			1
behind its success on both sides of the @entity105 is a multi-million - dollar publicity and marketing campaign on a scale not normally seen beyond the realms of a @entity111 blockbuster movie			1
industry sources in @entity55 — where there is a touring version of the show , plus long - standing productions in @entity117 and @entity118 — say producers have spent an unprecedented $ 1 million ( £ 650,000 ) marketing the show in @entity53 alone			1
as well as a flurry of double - page national newspaper adverts featuring glowing reviews , there is a high - profile @entity127 and @entity128 campaign to get the message out			2
book of mormon creators @entity131 ( left ) and @entity132 at last year 's @entity134 awards in @entity135 and on suburban railway stations around the @entity53 area a poster campaign has been launched featuring the gushing tweets of what purport to be ordinary members of the public who have seen the show			1
@entity53 theatre marketing firm @entity144 has been brought in with pr consultancy @entity145 to oversee the strategy			1
the theatre is also holding a daily lottery , where 21 ‘ lucky ’ punters , who pay £ 20 , have their names drawn from a tombola to win a ticket for that night ’s show			1
@entity156 , one of the most high - profile pr men in @entity117 , where @entity10 is about to enter its third year on @entity73 , told me : ‘ the marketing campaign has been brilliant			1
the producers have treated this show in the way @entity111 sells its biggest movies , and thrown millions of dollars at it			1
what they are saying to the public is that this show is sold out for months			1
therefore it must be great			2
‘ theatre - goers might know absolutely nothing about the material , but they think to themselves , “ i do n’t want to be the only person i know who is not going to see this show			1
” ’ those who do manage to get a ticket should be ready for blasphemy and profanity by the bucketload			2
the story follows two naive young @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 , played by @entity25 and @entity27 , who travel to an @entity184 - ridden @entity183 village to convert the locals			0
one song , a spoof of the ditty @entity190 , from @entity192 ’s @entity191 , has the natives belting out an f - word strewn two - fingered salute to @entity196 which includes lines such as , ‘ * * * * you , @entity196 ’ and ‘ * * * * you in the * * * *			0
’ elsewhere , there is a blood - drinking warlord who believes in female circumcision and that raping babies can cure @entity184			0
later one of the @entity3 evangelists persuades the locals the disease can , in fact , be eradicated by indulging in bestiality			0
the @entity65 has put up its prices because of the high demand for seats as one of the first to see the show in @entity53 , i can attest it is , indeed , vile , offensive and potty - mouthed			1
which might be forgivable were it not also puerile , crass and — worst of all — not very funny			0
but it must be conceded that on the evidence of the hysterical reaction of the audience at the preview i attended , i am in the minority			0
it all depends on your definition of high comedy			0
i found it surreal sitting stony - faced while those around me dissolved into paroxysms of laughter over an @entity183 — who looked like he was straight out of @entity235 — shouting over and over : ‘ i have maggots in my scrotum ’			0
yet , already there has started a rather sinister online campaign against anyone who does n’t fall over themselves to praise the show			1
recently , the @entity75 ’s @entity243 , who wrote a mildly flattering review , complained : ‘ is there something a bit bullying about @entity10 aficionados ? ca n’t one be sceptical about a @entity73 hit without being a snob ? nonetheless , a fightback of sorts has begun			0
in the @entity55 , the travel website @entity253 is full of theatre - goers appalled by the near - the - knuckle nature of the production			0
meanwhile , a @entity258 entitled , @entity257 , has sprung up			0
but the truth is that anyone who has ever watched @entity98 could n’t complain that they did not know they were letting themselves in for a no - holds - barred gross-fest simply by buying a ticket			0
behind the musical are writers @entity132 , 43 , and @entity131 , 41 , who created @entity98 in 1997			0
they have become vastly rich on the back of the cartoon series and now @entity10			0
each man is reported to have amassed a fortune of around £ 200 million			0
and they are expanding their powerful business empire			0
in january they signed a deal with multi- millionaire former @entity277 financier @entity276 to launch their own @entity111 film production company , @entity278			0
they plan to rival @entity281 ’s @entity280 and @entity282 , makers of @entity284 and @entity285			0
even before the @entity53 opening , @entity10 was a massive money - spinner			1
with the @entity9 show added to three productions in the @entity288 , @entity132 , @entity131 and fellow producer @entity289 are raking in just over £ 4 million a week			1
@entity131 and @entity132 already had great success with their near the knuckle humour in @entity98 the duo made their name with @entity98 , which follows the fortunes of a gang of schoolboys in a fictional @entity300 backwater , and purposely set out to shatter virtually every remaining television taboo			0
among @entity98 ’s list of targets are the disabled , jews , gays , @entity307 , @entity308 and the rich and famous			0
controversial storylines includes one from 2007 which showed a cartoon of the @entity311 blowing her brains out after a failed attempt to invade @entity55			0
another episode showed @entity284 actor @entity315 being raped several times by @entity281 and @entity317			0
but the writers ’ self - styled reputation for taking on powerful vested interests was dealt an embarrassing blow two years ago , before an episode which featured an image of the prophet @entity324			0
a little known @entity117 - based @entity326 website , called @entity327 , warned that the show ’s two creators faced being murdered if the depiction went ahead			1
despite the radical group having no more than ten official members , the @entity98 producers caved in			1
the images of @entity324 were covered by a ‘ censored ’ sign and references to him were bleeped out			0
the episode still featured a cartoon of @entity340 snorting cocaine and @entity342 downloading internet porn			0
likewise , the @entity14 is clearly an easier target than radical @entity326			0
even so , producers were so frightened of reprisals they insisted on strict security at the @entity53 theatre rehearsals of the musical , with guests having to sign in and mail strictly checked for suspect devices			1
as it turned out , the good - natured @entity178 decided to see the funny side of theatre ’s crudest and most over-hyped show of all time			1
but how long will it be before audiences who have paid a small fortune to see it start to feel it is a case of the emperor ’s new clothes ?			0

tickets for the show are like gold dust and sales have broken records
producers spent an unprecedented $ *1million* on marketing in @entity53 alone
