a @entity1 arbitrator has ruled that @entity4 ’s $ 4,900 - a - month @entity3 pension be reinstated , including back payments from october 2012 , when his child molestation conviction prompted the state retirement system to end his benefits			1
hearing examiner @entity9 wrote in an opinion dated thursday but made public monday that it was clear the former assistant football coach was no longer a @entity3 employee after his 1999 retirement			1
that was critical to the pension dispute because the state @entity17 was expanded five years later , in 2004 , to add sexual offenses to the list of crimes that trigger forfeiture			1
‘ the courts simply can not extend the current law beyond any rational interpretation of its current form			0
’ both @entity4 and the @entity39 ’ @entity38 can respond to the recommendation , after which the retirement system board will decide whether the pension should be reinstated			2
that could occur this fall , and if @entity4 loses he could appeal to state courts			0
@entity46 , a spokeswoman for @entity31 , said @entity48 ' recommendation will go to the agency board for a final determination in ‘ mid-to - late fall			0
’ if the board accepts @entity48 ’ recommendation , @entity4 ’s @entity3 pension would be reinstated to oct. 9 , 2012 , when he and his wife , @entity54 , lost the $ 4,900 - a - month state benefit			1
@entity4 , who retired in june 30 , 1999 , as @entity3 's defensive coordinator , was convicted in 2012 of molesting 10 boys over 15 years , some in the football team 's showers on campus			1
@entity9 said that even though @entity3 provided @entity4 with an office and telephone after his retirement , he was not a ’ school employee			2
’ he said there was no formal contract or agreement between him and the university			0
guilty : former @entity3 assistant football coach @entity4 , walks with his wife @entity70 into the @entity71 , on june 22 , 2012 in @entity72 , @entity1 @entity4 ’s lawyer , @entity73 , said monday he was pleased with the ruling , which accepted @entity73 ’s argument that a report by former @entity78 director @entity77 was incorrect when it claimed @entity4 received 71 post-retirement payments from @entity3			1
in fact there were just a handful , and half were travel reimbursements , @entity73 said			0
‘ the unfortunate thing here is that @entity31 acted on the mistaken belief that the @entity77 report was correct when the undisputed evidence showed it was n’t correct , ’ @entity73 said			0
@entity4 testified in january on the pension issue by video link from a state prison in southwestern @entity1			2
he was the only witness his lawyers called			0
his pension benefits include a 50 per cent survivor ’s annuity for @entity70			0
the 70 - year - old @entity4 is serving a 30 - to 60 - year state prison sentence after being convicted two years ago of sexual abuse of 10 boys			1
in a separate development on monday , @entity1 's attorney general released a highly anticipated review of the @entity4 prosecution but found no evidence of political interference by @entity1 governor @entity106 during his time as attorney general			2
the report , however , has revealed three years of ' inexplicable delays ' to prosecute the former @entity3 football coach on child abuse charges			1
the pedophile 's home was not searched and the report notes that it took a full year , from march 2009 until march 2010 , for the office to recommend charging @entity4 when ' @entity118 ' came forward			0
not caught soon enough : @entity4 in @entity120 where is serving life in jail for sexually molesting 10 boys over 15 - years it took more 18 months before @entity4 was arrested because veteran prosecutor @entity124 was overruled from arresting her because her supervisors believed that the testimony of one victim would be ' insufficient against a community icon like @entity4 '			1
the report , commissioned by attorney general @entity130 and written by former federal prosecutor @entity131 , blamed a three - year time lapse in filing charges on communication problems , an expungement of a 1998 complaint about the former @entity3 coach and a failure to take certain investigative steps early on			0
two days after @entity106 was elected governor in november 2010 , the @entity71 prosecutor received an anonymous tip directing investigators to assistant football coach @entity144 , whose testimony would eventually help convict @entity4			2
special deputy attorney general h. @entity146 speaks at a news conference as @entity1 state attorney general @entity130 , left , listens , as the results are released of a probe into the @entity4 child molestation investigation on monday , june 23 the investigation picked up steam after that , and authorities subpoenaed key figures at @entity3 , including @entity156 , vice president @entity157 and athletic director @entity158			1
additional victims were identified , and on june 21 , 2011 , @entity4 's home was searched , producing photos and typewritten lists of children who participated in events at @entity4 's charity , @entity166 , with some names highlighted			0
the university eventually accepted a set of penalties from the @entity171 over its handling of the matter , including a four - year bowl ban , a temporary reduction in football scholarships , the loss of 112 wins from @entity156 's later years and a $ 60 million fine .			2
