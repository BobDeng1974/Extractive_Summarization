@entity1 scholars are furious after new flooring was fitted ' behind their backs ' by the @entity5 authority in charge of @entity8 's holiest site - potentially covering up clues to the location of the ' @entity11 '			1
the work at the @entity13 was simply meant to replace carpet , worn away by thousands of pilgrims at the gold - topped shrine , which overlooks old @entity18			1
but when the old carpet was lifted , it revealed previously undocumented ancient floor designs - which could point to where the gold - cased @entity22 was buried 2,500 years ago			1
the discovery of the cryptic geometric patterns immediately caught the attention of some researchers , thrilled at the possibility of solving the @entity31 - type mystery which touches upon a holy grail for biblical enthusiasts			2
i do n't know what			2
but something is hidden there , ' said @entity1 archaeologist @entity54 , who studies the site			1
yet it looks likely it will remain a mystery : scholars did not get the chance to document the designs before workmen began laying the new carpet , paid for by @entity64 , the country which remains the custodian of the area 's @entity5 holy sites			1
it has sparked a war of words between the @entity72 , the @entity5 authority that administers the @entity75 compound , which includes the @entity13 , and @entity1 archaeological authorities , who say the repairs were carried out behind their backs			1
the scholars also fear the glue being used may permanently damage the floor			2
@entity1 's housing minister @entity82 , of the @entity83 , waded in to the argument to urge an immediate halt to the work			1
in an alarmed letter sent to prime minister @entity88 last week , he wrote : ' there is no need to elaborate on how important this site is , where every modification , every excavation with heavy equipment can cause irreparable harm to the foundations of the @entity98			0
' row : the @entity13 is one of the most contentious religious spots in all of @entity18 , and the argument over the carpet is simply the latest in a long line of battle between @entity5 and @entity46 groups holy : the @entity13 and its hilltop plaza is considered @entity8 's holiest spot and @entity107 's third holiest but the @entity72 reject the accusations			1
sheikh @entity109 , the head of the @entity72 , said the work is long overdue and has defiantly proclaimed that he was forbidding any @entity1 involvement			1
' our work in @entity75 is transparent , ' he said			0
' we are only putting down carpet and felt			2
nothing more , nothing less			0
' they also deny the work will cause any damage			0
@entity119 , a member of a group of @entity122 carpet layers who received @entity1 visas for the job , said it was necessary to affix the base layer of thin dark felt before rolling out the carpet above it			1
' it comes off my hand , ' he added , rubbing his fingers			0
heritage : the @entity13 is thought to be one of the most interesting archaeological sites in @entity18 finance : this latest work , pictured last sunday , is being paid for by @entity64 of @entity122 this is not the first time tensions have flared over work at the @entity13			1
the @entity13 is at the centre of competing claims			1
@entity5 believe it enshrines the large rock slab where @entity5 tradition says the @entity146 ascended to heaven			0
meanwhile , @entity46 believe the rock may be where the holiest part of the two ancient temples stood as early as about 3,000 years ago — and where religious @entity46 pray a third @entity98 will one day be built			0
ancient @entity46 traditions say the @entity22			1
which contained the @entity154 , may have been hidden away in a chamber when the @entity98 was destroyed			1
the adjacent @entity156 , believed to be one of the last remnants of the @entity98 complex , is the holiest site where @entity46 can pray			0
but @entity161 officials reject @entity46 historical ties to the site and the competing claims have been known to spill over into violence			2
while @entity18 may be the most excavated city in the world , the @entity13 and its hilltop plaza are an archaeological goldmine which has never been properly dug because of the political sensitivities surrounding the site , which is considered @entity8 's holiest spot and @entity107 's third holiest			1
in 1999 , the @entity5 authorities who administer the site dug an enormous hole 12 metres , or 40 feet , deep as part of construction for an underground prayer area , dumping 10,000 tons of earth in a nearby valley and an east @entity18 dump			0
the director of the @entity183 at the time called it an ' archaeological crime '			0
for years , @entity54 and veteran @entity1 archaeologist @entity187 have been leading a team of archaeologists and volunteers in combing through the dirt for historical finds			1
the initiative , called the @entity194 , is conducted under the auspices of the @entity196 , a group that also purchases @entity198 homes in contested parts of @entity18 and helps move @entity46 in			0
critics say this nationalist agenda should not mix with archaeology			0
@entity1 's state comptroller wrote a scathing report in 2010 about the @entity5 authorities ' illicit work projects at the compound and @entity1 's failure at enforcing supervision there			1
@entity1 officials kept the report classified out of concern that its publication could harm the sensitive relationship with @entity122			1
tens of thousands of worshippers attend weekly friday prayers , and the carpets have been replaced before — most recently 12 years ago , at a time of heightened violence when @entity1 antiquities officials were granted limited access to the site			2
social media : leaked photos of the work have fuelled this latest argument between the two sides past renovation projects were done quietly behind the scenes			0
leaked photos posted on social media sites — combined with the political influence of @entity1 nationalists monitoring the site — drew extra attention and fuelled the latest controversy			2
photos that were leaked to @entity239 from the off - limits restoration site showed a number of geometric floor patterns never before documented by archaeologists , said @entity244 , a researcher with the @entity194			2
some apparently date to when the @entity246 controlled the complex in the 12th century , she said			0
' i 'm worried about damage of the original floors , ' said @entity187 , the archaeologist			0
' the patterns were never properly documented			0
' @entity254 , the director of the @entity183 , said once the government body learned about the renovation , it made arrangements with the @entity72 to send an archaeologist to document some of the floor patterns , but others already had been covered by the maroon and beige carpeting			1
' we got to part of them			0
we did n't get to it all			0
i wo n't ask anyone to pull up the carpets to document it , ' @entity254 said			2
' we will wait for the next opportunity			0
we 're sure to be here over the next 2,000 years			0

row erupted after mysterious geometric designs discovered under carpet
some hope they may lead to chamber where @entity22 is hidden
but new flooring laid before @entity1 scholars were able to document pattern
but @entity72 , the authority in charge of @entity13 , reject accusations
