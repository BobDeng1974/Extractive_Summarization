@entity0 , 46 , from @entity1 , suffered a massive stroke soon after boarding a nine - hour night flight from the @entity4 and was unable to move or tell anyone a man who had a massive stroke on a plane has told how it left him stuck in his seat for nine hours , unable to alert anyone to what had happened			1
@entity0 , 46 , from @entity1 , was only given help and first aid after the plane landed and cabin crew spotted him still in his seat after everyone else had got off			1
the @entity18 employee , who could n't speak or move as a result of the stroke , was then rushed by ambulance to hospital , where he spent 16 days before being allowed home			1
mr @entity0 , whose wife @entity24 and son were at home in @entity27 , was flying home alone to @entity29 from a business conference in @entity31 when he was taken ill. before boarding the @entity33 flight , he suffered a mini-stroke at his hotel , but did not realise this and boarded the plane home assuming he was just unwell			1
the father of one said : ' i did n't realise it was a stroke , i thought i 'd slept funnily			1
i assumed i could sleep it off and i 'd be fine in the morning			0
' he said that after the mini-stroke , also known as a @entity46 ( transient ischaemic attack ) , he felt as though he was drunk			2
' i was unstable and banging into things , ' he said			0
' i do n't know how i got through security at the airport - i think they thought i was drunk			2
' he then boarded the night flight and settled into his middle seat in a bank of three			1
' the middle seat , when you 're 6ft 4in , is bad enough , and i just lost all feeling			0
' once there , he suffered a second , massive , stroke , which left him unable to tell anyone or even move for the entire flight			1
he said : ' i 'm not sure exactly when it happened but it was pretty soon after i sat down			0
my arm was twitching , so i sat on it , and then it just went numb			0
' shock : mr @entity0 's wife @entity24 , 46 , rushed to hospital to be told her husband had had a massive stroke with the lights dimmed , mr @entity0 went unnoticed , even after the plane landed at @entity76 and passengers disembarked			1
the man sitting next to mr @entity0 climbed over him to get out			1
he said : ' he asked me to move and obviously i could n't , so he just climbed over			1
everything after that is a blur			0
' cabin crew spotted mr @entity0 still in his seat in the otherwise empty plane , and came to his aid			1
he said : ' i think i knew then i would be looked after - the ambulance came onto the forecourt to get me off the plane			2
mr @entity0 said no - one suspected he had had a stroke because no - one expects someone in their 40s to have one ' at the hospital my wife was told i 'd suffered a stroke			1
' he added : ' i could n't say many words , but there was a @entity101 lady on my ward and i kept shouting ' @entity103 ' at her from the film @entity104			2
' i could sing , too - the nurse would sing @entity106 and i would make the pig noises			0
' after being allowed home , it took several months for mr @entity0 to be able to use his right hand , and six months for him to be able to hold a proper conversation			1
he said : ' my movement came back relatively quickly , but from my fingers to my elbow is still a bit sketchy			0
' when i was in hospital i was given a coffee and because i could n’t control my hand i squashed the cup			0
it just was n’t working properly			0
' it ’s getting better every day and i look like a normal person apart from my right hand			0
' the stroke has ruined me with numbers			2
i ca n’t do anything consecutively			0
i ca n’t do seasons or months - things that should be easy to do			0
' eighteen months on from the stroke , mr @entity0 , who praised @entity33 staff for reacting quickly once they realised what had happened , and even calling him days later to check how he was , said he 's not surprised he went unnoticed during the night flight			1
he said : ' nobody looks at you and thinks it ’s going to be a stroke			2
if i was 10 or 20 years older then they might have thought about a stroke , but not at my age			2
' mr @entity0 , pictured at home with his dog @entity144 , says @entity33 staff were efficient when they realised he was ill strokes can be revealed with an mri of the brain ( file image , above ) but there are other , more obvious , symptoms @entity0 suffered , as many stroke patients do , a @entity46 , or early - warning mini-stroke before having a second , massive stroke			1
the @entity155 says that one in 10 people who suffer a @entity46 go on to have a full - blown stroke within a week if they remain untreated			2
a tia is a sign that part of the brain is n't getting enough blood			2
each year more than 46,000 people have their first @entity46			0
doctors say people should remember the @entity166 test to help them diagnose if they or someone else has had a stroke or mini-stroke			1
@entity170 is for face - has the face fallen on one side ? can they smile ? @entity175 is for arms - can they raise both arms and keep them there ? @entity179 is for speech - is their speech slurred ? @entity182 is for time - it is time to call an ambulance if one of the above applies			0
@entity187 , a @entity155 coordinator who supported mr @entity0 , said : ' @entity0 ’s story highlights the fact that when someone has a stroke , often they can not communicate			1
' that ’s why it ’s so important to be aware of the symptoms of stroke , use the @entity166 test , and seek urgent medical attention if you suspect a stroke			1
' stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the @entity204 and the emotional effects can be just as devastating as the physical			0
' a stroke can happen out of the blue and be very frightening			0
but with the right help and support many people can build a life after stroke			0
