and it seems that @entity12 has got her wish			1
within hours , hundreds of fans slammed the star ’s record for its x-rated lyrics and ‘ pornographic ’ videos in which she twerks and dresses scantily			1
some users questioned whether she was a fit role model to millions of young fans			2
the star , who rose to fame in girl band @entity43 , has often campaigned for women ’s rights			0
but fans said she should now be ashamed of herself for following in the footsteps of @entity47 and @entity48 , who have shocked viewers with their erotic music videos			1
and they accused her of ‘ cashing in ’ on her one - year - old daughter , @entity52 , who features in one of the clips			1
campaigners and parents yesterday called for video sharing site @entity57 , where the 17 videos can be seen , and @entity7 , where the self - titled album of 14 songs costs £ 12.99 , to ban the explicit content			1

‘ she was the one we always thought we could count on to set a good example and keep producing music with powerful messages that empowered women and girls			0
‘ and i would have thought that a star of her magnitude would n’t need to do something like this			0
‘ she has sold out and it ’s really sad			0
like it or not @entity12 is a role model and she needs to take responsibility for that			1
especially as a mother herself , it ’s very surprising that she would do this			0
she added : ‘ this is now on @entity57 and children can see it			0
‘ it ’s not like parents can protect their children by not buying the album			2
it ’s there , on the internet , for anyone to access and as a parent that is incredibly worrying			0
’ among the most shocking of the videos is @entity31 , in which @entity12 cage dances for her husband , 44 - year - old rapper @entity118 , before writhing around on the floor in her underwear			1
she sings about a rough sexual encounter taking place in the back seat of a car and refers to the @entity125			2

‘ it ’s a very , very stupid thing to do and not rational at all			0
‘ my view would be that the whole album should be banned			2
even with age ratings it would still circulate round the playground and it ’s sheer exploitation			0
