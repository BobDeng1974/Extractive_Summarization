@entity2 ( left ) is thought to be examining five offers for the @entity4			1
she is trying to offload the sports franchise before next tuesday when the @entity16 will vote to strip husband @entity13 ( right ) of ownership a source close to the bidding process said the sale price ' appears to be increasing to an unbelievable number , ' adding that it could soar past the expected $ 1.5billion to $ 2 billion , and possibly more			1
the deal is set to smash league records for the most expensive @entity16 franchise ever sold , beating the $ 550million paid for the @entity31 earlier this month			1
another person familiar with the negotiations said @entity2 's attorneys , bankers and others involved in the process were in a locked room reviewing the bids , which were due by 2 p.m. pdt wednesday			1
according to the @entity40 , @entity6 , thought to be worth $ 20billion , is leading one bid , with another group including basketball star @entity9 , @entity43 , minority owner of the @entity16 ’s @entity45 , and @entity46 , minority owner of baseball ’s @entity47			1
a third group includes @entity51 software co-founder @entity50 , entertainment magnate @entity52 and @entity8			0
according to @entity54 that group has now added @entity56 - based @entity55 - who had previously partnered with @entity59 - @entity11 widow @entity58 , @entity61 ex-wife @entity60 , and @entity63 co-founder @entity62			0
a fourth offer is expected to come from bidders backed by @entity67 investors , though less is known about this group			0
potential buyers are thought to be offering up to 80 per cent of their bid in cash in order to simplify the deal , while another source suggested they are also being asked for deposits of £ 300million			2
however , @entity13 's attorney @entity76 , has caused some confusion by saying there would be no sale of the team without @entity13 's involvement			2
@entity13 was fined $ 2.5million and banned from the @entity16 after he was recorded making racist comments it was reported that @entity2 was authorised to sell 100 per cent of the franchise on behalf of her husband			1
a letter dated may 22 , written by one of @entity13 's attorneys and signed by him stated : ' @entity13 authorizes @entity2 to negotiate with the @entity16 regarding all issues in connection with a sale of the @entity4 team			1
' however , the latest comment has raised fears that @entity13 is simply using the bidding process to establish a value for the team , before suing the @entity16 for that amount in damages if they force him to sell			1
@entity16 spokesman @entity100 said the league 's advisory / finance committee met wednesday by phone to discuss the separate responses from @entity13 and @entity2 to the @entity16 on its efforts to end the @entity107 ' ownership of the @entity4			1
an source close to the @entity16 said that the league 's owners know a sale could n't be completed by next tuesday , but if an agreement was in place , the @entity16 would give the @entity107 extra time before holding any meetings			1
the individual said the league hopes a voluntary sale would remove the potential of legal action being taken by the @entity107			2
they added that at this point , with @entity13 saying he plans to fight the matter in court , the @entity16 intends to go forward with the meeting in @entity126 on june 3			2
a forced sale would require approval by three - fourths of the league 's 30 owners			2
@entity16 commissioner @entity132 has said he is confident he would get the necessary votes			2
on tuesday , @entity13 issued a fiery response to the league 's attempt to oust him			0
@entity6 , former @entity7 ceo thought to be worth $ 20billion , is thought to be leading one bid another group includes @entity51 software ceo @entity50 ( left ) and entertainment magnate @entity52 ( right ) the league is accusing him of damaging it and its merchandising partners with his racist comments released in a recording released last month			2
@entity13 argued that there is no basis for stripping him of his team because his statements were illegally recorded ' during an inflamed lovers ' quarrel in which he was clearly distraught			0
' according to the response , @entity13 says girlfriend @entity151 recorded him without his knowledge , which is illegal under @entity154 law			0
he also said he could not have ' willfully ' damaged the league because he did not know it would be made public			0
' we do not believe a court in the @entity158 will enforce the draconian penalties imposed on mr. @entity13 in these circumstances , and indeed , we believe that preservation of mr. @entity13 's constitutional rights requires that these sham proceedings be terminated in mr. @entity13 's favor , ' the response said			0
@entity13 was banned for life and fined $ 2.5 million by @entity16 commissioner @entity132 after the recording was made public			1
it is possible @entity2 could complete an expedited sale of the team despite her husband 's legal wranglings , according to @entity172 , director of the @entity173 at @entity174 in @entity175			1
he said : ' she would have to be willing to go through with a sale that gave her absolutely no retained ownership interest in order to satisfy the league			0
' if she did that , i do n't think the league would stand in her way			0
if she wants to retain any portion of ownership it would n't work			0
' even if @entity2 accepts an offer , the league has the right to approve potential owners , a lengthy process that would almost certainly not be completed by next tuesday			1
' the best case scenario is she finds a suitable buyer , ' @entity172 said			0
that would work for the league and from a financial standpoint that would work for the @entity107			0
' if the sale price is satisfactory , the smart thing might be to just get out			0
he 's a businessman who understands buy low and sell high			0
' @entity13 purchased the @entity4 for $ 12 million in 1981 , making him the league 's longest - tenured owner			1
@entity172 noted that @entity13 signed the @entity16 's constitution when he joined the league , and its bylaws spell out specific procedures for terminating ownership			2
he said as long as the league follows its own rules it should be on solid legal ground			0
' i could see a happy ending to this , ' @entity172 added , ' but it will depend on both of the @entity107 being out of the picture			0

@entity2 is thought to be considering five bids for @entity4
racing to offload the team before @entity16 try to force sale next tuesday
sources close to bidding say offers may reach an @entity16 record $ 2billion
