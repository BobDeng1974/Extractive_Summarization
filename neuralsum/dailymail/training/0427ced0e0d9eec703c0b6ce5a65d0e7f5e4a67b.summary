' it did n't brake and it did n't swerve			0
it was going at about 70mph			0
' it was strange , there seemed to be no input from the driver , it just glided past			0
' @entity71 was driving the hgv which mrs @entity8 crashed into			1
he said he was driving at about 10mph at the time			0
' at that point i heard a loud bang and my vehicle appeared to be pushed forward , making me go faster than i was , ' said mr @entity71			2

dr @entity99 said there was no evidence that mrs @entity8 had suffered complications arising from her recent pregnancy and said she was alive at the time of the crash			1
' she had injuries that were completely unsurvivable , ' dr @entity99 told the hearing			0

forensic collision investigator @entity119 said there was no evidence of any alcohol or drugs in @entity124 and that driving conditions were good at the time			1

' @entity12 assistant coroner @entity134 , who recorded a verdict of accidental death , described the death as a ' tragedy			1
' mr @entity134 said : ' there was no direct medical evidence to suggest that @entity8 had blacked out , although it seems to me that is a possibility			2

members of mrs @entity8 's family attended the inquest , including her husband , but declined to comment at its conclusion			1

' @entity155 was vibrant , beautiful , and caring in so many ways			0
a girl who added zest to a room and who had found true love and happiness with her husband of just one year , @entity199			0
' to have her taken from her family at such a happy time is utterly unbearable			0
