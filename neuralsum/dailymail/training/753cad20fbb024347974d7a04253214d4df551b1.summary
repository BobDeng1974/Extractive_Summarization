but she received around 20 letters from the @entity9 claiming her father owed £ 6 on his account			1
although she sent a copy of her father 's death certificate to close the account the bank insisted the original certificate must be shown			1
@entity18 took her father 's ashes , in the green box , into her bank to prove to staff he was dead mother - of - two @entity22 was then mailed a string of further letters as the outstanding overdraft amount mushroomed to £ 625 with interest			1
eventually miss @entity5 stunned bank staff and customers by going to the local @entity9 branch in @entity31 , near @entity32 , @entity33 , in person with the urn containing her father 's ashes			1
she then dumped it on the counter - along with the original death certificate and declared : ' you wanted proof my dad is dead - well here he is			1
i 've brought him along with me			0
' she said : ' i took my dad to the bank , slapped his ashes on the counter and thought that would be the end of it			0
there was nothing owing on the account and i was sick of getting hassled			0
' miss @entity5 , who was her father 's carer after he retired as a builder 's labourer added : ' it has been 18 months of hell			0
i have told the bank over and over to close the account and it has n't been done			2
' they asked me for a copy of his death certificate and i sent it straight away but still they did n't close it down			1
miss @entity5 stunned bank staff and customers by going to the local @entity9 branch ( pictured ) in @entity31 , near @entity32 , @entity33 , in person with the urn containing her father 's ashes ' because of that it built up charges from direct debits and charges grew to over £ 600			1
' she said she took her father 's ashes to the @entity9 branch two weeks ago after reaching the end of her tether			1
she said : ' i slapped his ashes down on the counter and said " this is @entity89 and i want to close his account for him "			0
the lady behind the counter had such a shock that she ran away and would n't come back			0
miss @entity5 received around 20 letters from the @entity9 claiming her father owed £ 6 on his account ' eventually the bank manager came to see me and agreed to close the account			1
but even after that i had another letter to my father from the bank come to the house			2
i just ca n't believe how the bank has treated us			0
' it is as if the bank has been deliberately trying to upset me			0
it has been a very difficult time losing my father and this has just made it so difficult			0
i have had on average two letters per week for the past 18 months chasing him forthe bank charges			2
' all i want now is a decent apology			0
i sent them a copy of the death certificate and that should have been enough			1
i did n't want to give them the original as i obviously i wanted to keep that			0
' the problem started with an unresolved £ 6 charge on the account after mr @entity22 's death which the @entity9 told his daughter had been imposed as there were insufficient funds to cover a withdrawal			1
it increased to more than £ 600 and has now been passed onto a debt recovery agent although the account has been closed			2
miss @entity5 who has two sons and still lives in the house she shared with her father , lost her mother @entity135 when she was just 15			0
a spokesman for the @entity9 said : ' after ms @entity137 visited the branch further information came to light which meant it was necessary to contact her again			2
we apologise for any distress cause and have now closed theaccount			2
