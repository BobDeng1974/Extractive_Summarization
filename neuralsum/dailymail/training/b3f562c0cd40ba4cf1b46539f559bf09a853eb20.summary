where are the @entity1 of last season ? it is a question that has been asked of @entity4 almost every week since this campaign began			1
having seen their team come within a whisker of winning the @entity11 , the anticipation supporters would have felt during the summer has , after three defeats in five matches , started to be replaced by apprehension			1
they feel like they have been here before			0
in some respects , they have			0
given the changes that have taken place since last may , it is impossible not to draw parallels with what happened in 2009 , when @entity1 finished runners - up to @entity23 but failed to take the final step			1
@entity25 ( left ) has failed to impress since signing for @entity1 from @entity26 @entity4 has struggled to get @entity1 playing the way they were last season for the sale of @entity31 to @entity32 this summer , you had the departure of @entity34 to @entity35 back then			1
no matter how brave a face you try to put on the situation , you can not under - estimate how damaging it is to lose part of the spine of your team			2
@entity31 , with his 31 goals , was clearly more vital to what @entity1 achieved last season than @entity34 was in 2008 - 09 but the perception around both transfers is the same : you know you are losing a world - class talent and the team no longer looks right			1
our problem in 2009 was the fact @entity34 ’s replacement , @entity54 , arrived injured and struggled to make an impact			1
this year @entity4 has seen his band ’s lead singer move on and , so far , it seems as if @entity31 has been replaced with backing singers			1
@entity1 , however , have spent more than £ 100million			1
with nine new faces arriving , there will be a period of adjustment and we have heard how they will need time to settle			0
i used to feel , though , that you could gauge within a couple of months about whether a signing would be successful			0
@entity1 have suffered three defeats from their opening five @entity11 games the departures of @entity31 in the summer and @entity34 in 2009 have had an impact on the team the @entity75 forward scored an astonishing 31 goals for @entity1 last season @entity78 has failed to hit the ground running at @entity1 since joining from @entity80 last year @entity81 ( above ) did n't need any time to settle into his career at @entity84 think about it : @entity86 and @entity87 on to @entity34 , @entity81 , @entity88 , @entity31 and even @entity89 — they were all doing the business almost as soon as they walked through the door			1
those who struggled in their first season very rarely turned it around in their second year			0
i know it ’s early days but , when you have spent £ 38m on defenders like @entity25 and @entity78 , you do n’t want to be hearing about settling in			1
you want instant results but @entity1 are shipping goals			2
@entity25 was brought in to add leadership at the back but @entity1 actually look worse defensively than they did last season			1
@entity78 does n’t fill you with confidence when you watch him and nor does the goalkeeper , @entity107			2
they need to step it up urgently			0
@entity4 had the good fortune last season of injuries not making much impact on his team but , with a bigger fixture list , he had to invest to bring in numbers and quality			1
of those who have come in only @entity119 , the young @entity120 left back , has impressed me so far			0
@entity122 striker @entity89 hit the ground running after his move from @entity125 @entity126 ( left ) has a tendency to walk around and must work harder to get into the box @entity107 ( pictured ) needs to step up and put in better performances for @entity1 it must be emphasised it is still early days but the one thing that i associate with @entity4 ’ @entity1 is absent : intensity			1
with and without the ball , @entity1 would n’t let the opposition settle , blitzing them with whirlwind starts			2
@entity139 , who cross @entity141 on saturday , felt that force in january			0
@entity31 set the tone , harrying and hassling			2
he defended from the front and is the best in the world at creating that relentless energy that swamped teams			0
if intensity is the word you associate with @entity4 ’ @entity1 , you would not use it to describe @entity126 , @entity31 ’s replacement			1
when he played for @entity154 , i was n't a fan and what i 've seen so far has n't persuaded me to change my mind			0
he has a tendency to walk around , which i do n’t like to see			0
he has to bust a gut more often to get in the box			0
@entity31 hit the ground running at @entity1 and played a key role during his time at @entity84 @entity164 ( left ) and @entity165 do not play at their best when they are in the same side @entity1 were beaten 3 - 1 at @entity167 in their last @entity11 outing another issue troubling @entity4 is that @entity1 have n’t been creating chances with the same frequency either			1
teams have targeted @entity165 to stop him launching attacks from deep , with @entity174 and @entity175 stifling him in the defeats by @entity177 and @entity178			2
when @entity31 , @entity89 and @entity180 were at their devastating best last season , it suited @entity165 to sit deep and pull the strings but with @entity31 gone and @entity89 injured , who is there to score and create ? there has been a lot of talk about his form in the holding - midfield role			1
if he continues to be targeted is there an option for him to play further forward and give teams something different to think about ? @entity165 is at his best when he is able to sit deep in midfield , but has been exposed this season @entity196 midfielder @entity195 ( centre ) has struggled for form so far this season no other midfielder in the squad has the ability to score from outside the box or create like the captain			1
of the others who can create , @entity195 is struggling for form and @entity205 has only just returned from injury			0
one thing that is certain is @entity165 and @entity164 struggle to play together			1
@entity164 should come in for the games when @entity209 is rested			2
@entity165 is used to such scrutiny but maybe some of the others have not experienced the criticism that has come their way this week			2
yet if @entity1 do not improve in the next two games against @entity139 and @entity216 in the @entity217 , they wo n’t know what has hit them			2
do not mistake how important a win in the @entity221 derby would be for @entity1			1
this could be exactly what the team needs as a springboard			0
with @entity139 chasing a first win at @entity84 since 1999 , there could be no better time for last season ’s @entity1 to reappear			1
@entity1 were beaten 3 - 1 by @entity11 champions @entity154 in august @entity230 is piling pressure on @entity232 it 's a big weekend for a number of managers , not least @entity232 , who takes @entity236 into the north @entity238 derby			1
if @entity236 were to lose at the @entity239 today following last week ’s disappointing performance against @entity241 , @entity232 would be considered to have had a poor start to his reign at @entity244			1
in contrast , @entity26 — the side he left behind — have been going from strength to strength and it will not have gone unnoticed by him that @entity230 , his replacement , delivered a win at @entity251 in the @entity252 on tuesday			0
@entity232 would be considered to have had a poor start should @entity236 lose at @entity251 @entity26 ’s flying start will have heaped a little bit of pressure on @entity232 , as they look as if they are improving without him			1
@entity259 faced this problem 12 months ago , when @entity23 struggled and @entity261 , his replacement , began to improve @entity139			2
i am a big fan of @entity232 and i thought his work at @entity26 was excellent			2
his teams were aggressive , well organised — he reminded me at times of how @entity266 used to set up @entity1 — but he has gone to a club where expectations are greater and results are demanded			1
@entity236 ’s ambition is to make it back into the @entity217 and while it will be difficult to get into the top four , @entity232 will be expected to oversee a better challenge for those places			2
there could be no better place to launch his reign than the @entity239			0
@entity230 is doing a good job at @entity26 and saw his side beat @entity251 in midweek @entity279 ( left ) and @entity280 look frustrated as @entity236 lose at home to @entity282 this week i 'm looking forward to ... seeing @entity283 build on last week ’s heroics			0
watching @entity283 ’s jet - heeled performance against @entity23 from the safety of a tv studio made me feel relieved to be retired ! he was bursting with energy and enthusiasm and tormented @entity23 ’s defenders , stealing the show in a remarkable game			2
to see @entity283 thriving on the big stage set a great example to young footballers of how they should never give up on their dream			0
@entity283 had a day to remember as he helped @entity300 beat @entity23 last weekend @entity283 deserves great credit for forcing his way through the ranks , from non-league @entity304 to @entity300 via @entity305 and @entity306 , and he will remember the day he took @entity23 apart for the rest of his life			0
the thing about the @entity11 , though , is that it does not allow you a moment to sit back and think you ’ve cracked it			0
you constantly face new challenges and you can not dwell on what has gone before			0
so , to take his game forward , @entity283 must produce in lesser matches , such as today ’s clash with @entity318			0
if he can do that consistently , he will ensure his name stays in the headlines			0
he has certainly given himself a fantastic base to build from			0
@entity283 has battled his way up from non-league football all the way up to the top flight with @entity300			0

@entity1 have endured a difficult start to the @entity11 season
@entity4 ' side have lost three of their opening five matches
@entity122 fans will be reminded of what happened in 2009 as @entity1 finished runners - up to @entity23
the loss of @entity34 in 2009 had a huge impact on the @entity1 team
@entity31 has been a huge loss and @entity126 is yet to prove that he can take the @entity75 's place
@entity1 have spent £ *38million* on @entity25 and @entity78
@entity165 and @entity164 struggle to play together
@entity232 is under pressure ahead of north @entity238 derby
