by @entity0 published : 06:45 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 08:57 est , 11 september 2013 everybody knows his bright red van			0
but no one knew it could do this			0
in a bizarre twist on the iconic children 's tv show , @entity7 's delivery car has been transformed into a high - speed powerhouse			1
with a top speed of 101.36mph , it is faster than a @entity15			1
but after three motor enthusiasts found the toy on @entity21 for £ 250 in 2012 , they could n't resist turning it into one of their fleet			1
they fitted it with wheels and a 500cc motorbike engine , and took it to the track			1
the little red van , complete with a toy cat stuck to the back , now has a faster quarter - mile speed than supercars such as the @entity49 and @entity50 v - 12 vanquish			1
after reaching 101.36mph at @entity53 in may , it has this month been deemed the world 's fastest coin - operated ride according to the @entity56			1
before : the plastic arcade ride was bought on @entity21 for £ 250			1
the trio inserted a 500cc motorbike engine @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 built a structure that would fit inside the shell and hold an engine it is a far cry from @entity7 's rickety red truck he drives around a village based on @entity70 's @entity69 in the show , which first screened in 1981 , @entity7 and his black - and - white cat , @entity72 , are known for trundling around the fictional village of @entity75 with the day 's mail			1
each episode , bumbling @entity7 gets distracted by a customer 's problem and strives , ham - handedly to fix it			1
in a later series screened in 2004 , the @entity82 's beloved postman was promoted to head of the flashy @entity85 , with a speedy red motorbike			2
but driven by the cautious and dopey mr @entity7 , it was still relatively slow			0
it is a far cry from the flashy scenes delighting nostalgic fans on race tracks around the country			0
in character : @entity62 wore a blue racing suit in the style of @entity7 , @entity75 's dopey delivery man the race : @entity62 won the novelty ride a @entity56 after reaching 101.36mph in may black and white cat : a toy of @entity72 , @entity7 's trusty pet , was attached to the back on wheels to complete the van winning proof : the all - important documents that won the trio their @entity56 this month @entity111 team @entity109 , @entity61 and @entity62 have been trialling creation for months - to hordes of disbelieving onlookers			1
and with news spreading fast , there are now calls for the @entity23 - based group to take it to the @entity119			1
mr @entity60 , 25 , said : ' the @entity111 is probably the most talked about race car in the country at the moment and has even made a huge impact in the @entity124			0
' after an aggressive launch the little @entity125 powered its way to victory			0
' we have been up against supercars such as a @entity15 and we left it standing , showing the spectators how fast this little van really is			0
' but , he insists , it requires expert driving to perform at its best : ' there is nobody that could just get in the van and drive it quite like @entity62 does			2
without a driver like @entity62 the van would not be what it is right now			2
' original : the box - like van became iconic when it first hit screens in 1981			2
despite recent @entity153 adaptations which gave @entity7 a motorbike , they are still not a patch on the new race car the three members of @entity158 have been interested in drag racing since an early age			0
they were all just weeks old when they attended their first drag race at @entity53			0
mr @entity60 said : ' the idea behind the @entity111 started a couple years ago , but we never actually made a start building the van until mid- 2012			0
we sourced a @entity7 child ’s coin operated ride from @entity21 for £ 250 and started to build it			1
' all the fabrication and engineering has been carried out by @entity61 and @entity172 1 is powered by a 500cc single cylinder motorbike engine			1
' the build was kept very quiet and very few people knew about the project , but now the @entity111 has become famous - people love it			0
' the iconic stop - motion children 's show was first screened in 1981			2
it was written by @entity182 and directed by @entity183 of @entity184 and the @entity186 fame			0
the second series in 1996 , after a number of tv specials , introduced @entity7 's wife , @entity191 , and six - year - old son , @entity192			1
set in the fictional village of @entity75 , based on the valley of @entity69 in @entity70 , @entity7 and his black and white cat , @entity72 , are problem - solvers			2
every episode starts with @entity7 delivering letters before becoming distracted by a problem			0
it was a key promotional tool for the @entity201 until 2004 when any mention of the service was dropped from the show			0
this third series saw @entity7 promoted to head of the @entity85 in the nearby town of @entity208 , where he has a fleet of vehicles including a motorbike with a side - car for @entity72			2
the franchise of tv episodes and books will soon include a 3d movie starring @entity217 as @entity7 , with co-stars including @entity219 , @entity220 and @entity221 .			0
