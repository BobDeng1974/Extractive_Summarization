career in tatters : @entity2 has resigned from his job with asset managers @entity4 a high flying city executive who dodged rail fares for five years has been branded as ' greedy ' and ' selfish ' after his identity was revealed			1
@entity2 has been unmasked as the mystery fare dodger of @entity10 who hit the news after settling a £ 43,000 bill for unpaid tickets over five years			1
the 44 - year - old investment executive is thought to be the biggest fare dodger in history - avoiding the £ 21.50 - a - day fee , despite owning two mansions worth £ 4million			1
he had hoped to avoid prosecution and publicity by reimbursing @entity22 trains just three days after being caught by a ticket inspector last november			1
law - abiding commuters were outraged when the story broke in april that the rail firm had allowed him to quietly settle the allegations without being prosecuted			2
now they have condemned his actions further			0
@entity30 from @entity31 said : ' apart from losing his job and getting the publicity that he so badly wanted to avoid , it is the selfish attitude of people like him that makes me sick			1
' did he think that all his honest fellow travelers were mugs ? i bet he wishes he could turn the clock back now			0
' @entity41 , also from @entity31 , said : i just do n't understand how this man got away with it for so long			1
' i know the @entity47 / @entity46 train well - @entity44 is one of the stops on the way - and the ticket inspectors are always on the train , and check tickets after every stop			2
' @entity55 added : ' the guy has the good fortune to earn a spectacular amount of money and he still does n't want to pay for his rail ticket like everyone else			0
' another said : ' earns over one million a year and scams the transport system of a few thousand a year			0
beggars belief how tight people can be			0
he is said to have told @entity22 he wanted his name kept secret because of the impact the scandal could have on his job			0
' but the @entity73 can reveal that his career is in tatters after @entity77 read the story in the @entity79 and began investigating			0
the news also came to the attention of @entity83 watchdog the @entity84 , with which @entity2 was registered			1
it started its own probe over concerns that his actions showed a lack of probity that could make him unsuitable for city work			2
but it was n’t until last week that he warned bosses at asset management firm @entity4 – who knew nothing of his fare - dodging shame – that they might be getting a call from the regulator			1
the married father of one was suspended from his job as a managing director and when @entity4 pressed him on the nature of the investigation he quit			1
although his resignation brought the @entity84 probe to an end , the scandal means he is unlikely to be able to work in finance again			0
a @entity83 source told the @entity73 : ‘ @entity2 was a very senior fund manager with @entity4 , dealing with hundreds of millions of pounds on a daily basis			1
but only last week he suddenly told his bosses , “ the @entity84 might give you a call ”			0
‘ he only let slip in passing that it was about this £ 40,000 fare - dodging payment			1
they suspended him immediately , but he refused to explain anything at all about the fare - dodging – and when more questions were asked he resigned without a payoff			1
‘ i ’m amazed the @entity84 are n’t continuing their investigations even though he ’s no longer registered with them			0
if they did , and found he has dodged rail fares for five years , i ’d expect him to be barred from the industry for life			2
even as it is i doubt he ’ll ever be able to work in the industry again			0
‘ he wo n’t get much sympathy , but he has lost his livelihood			0
he shares the @entity154 property – which boasts acres of landscaped grounds , ponds and a tennis court – with his wife @entity159 and their young child in an isolated spot not far from @entity44 station			0
last night a @entity163 and a £ 30,000 @entity164 could be seen at the property			0
his commuting scam was uncovered last year when a ticket inspector at @entity31 ’s @entity46 , close to @entity2 ’s office , saw him swiping through the ticket barriers with his pre-paid oyster travel card			1
the inspector realised @entity2 had been charged only £ 7.20 – the modest penalty imposed when a passenger has failed to swipe in at the start of a journey			1
@entity2 admitted having failed to use his @entity176 card to tap in for five journeys between @entity178 – where he got off his train from @entity10 – and @entity46 , which should have cost him just £ 2.30 a time			1
however , further inquiries revealed that until 2008 @entity2 had been buying an annual season ticket from @entity44 , which has no ticket barriers , to @entity46 , which costs around £ 4,500 a year for standard class			1
a standard daily single fare is £ 21.50			2
rural : pictured is @entity44 station , from which @entity2 dodged his fares for years he had then stopped buying season tickets , but simply continued working in @entity31 , apparently only paying £ 7.20 for the brief final leg of his long train journey			1
@entity22 told @entity2 he owed them £ 42,550 in unpaid fares , plus £ 450 in legal costs			2
@entity2 paid up promptly , apparently hoping that would be the end of the affair and no one would find out what he had done			2
but in april the tale emerged , and @entity77 contacted @entity22 and began a criminal investigation			0
last night , @entity4 spokesman @entity201 said : ‘ @entity2 has left @entity4			2
‘ what he is alleged to have done is totally contrary to our values and principles			0
’ asked about the case by the @entity73 , @entity2 said : ‘ dunno what you ’re talking about			2
’ @entity77 and @entity22 said they were still investigating			0
an @entity84 spokesman said that when anyone applies for fresh authorisation , ‘ past misconduct will be taken into consideration ’ , adding : ‘ that does n’t have to be a criminal record , it can be anything that calls into question someone ’s fitness and propriety to work in the industry			0

@entity2 , 44 , skipped train fare from @entity225 to @entity31 for five years
caught out after using oyster card to pay just £ 7.20 a day for long commute
@entity2 hoped to avoid publicity by paying up quickly when found out
but police and @entity83 regulator heard of the story and started to investigate
the £ 1million - a - year asset manager was suspended by *employers* last week
but when pressed on the scam he quit , ending probe into his conduct
