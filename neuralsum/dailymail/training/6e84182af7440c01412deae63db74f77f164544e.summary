@entity0 is edging closer to a return to action and could play some part when @entity4 visit @entity5 a week on saturday			1
this weekend 's match against @entity7 comes too soon but @entity8 will decide whether the @entity9 is ready for an under - 21 clash with @entity11 on monday as part of his re-integration following five months out with a ruptured @entity14			1
the virus that spread throughout @entity8 's squad and undermined their loss to @entity18 looks to have been eradicated after the ground was closed on monday			1
@entity21 's @entity0 's imminent return to the @entity23 squad will come as a huge boost to @entity8 @entity23 captain @entity25 will return to @entity8 's squad after the international break captain @entity25 will not feature before the international break due to his groin injury however			1
but the news is more positive on @entity0			1
' he 's getting closer , ' said @entity8			1
' next week we will see how he is for the @entity4 game			1
i 'm not saying he 'll start , or anything , but he 's certainly getting close			2
' he 's had another good week under his belt			2
people forget he 's been out five months , he 's only trained three weeks			2
' he 's not done a pre-season			2
but playing football he 's been getting a few kicks			0
' the injury is totally fine , i 'm not worried about that			1
he 's taken a couple little kicks in training and has come through them			0
' it 's just his lack of practise			0
you 've got to watch he does n't break down after too much too soon			2
' everybody is happy to see him come back			0
it 's been a long road for him , missed the @entity53			0
him coming back has been great			0
it will give everyone a lift when he comes back , supporters included			0
' common sense has to prevail			0
it would be a risk to throw him in			0

@entity0 has been out of action since tearing his @entity14 in april
@entity8 is *hopeful* though that his star *striker* could feature when champions @entity4 travel to @entity5 next saturday
the @entity23 boss also reveals skipper @entity25 will be missing from the squad until after the international break with a groin injury
