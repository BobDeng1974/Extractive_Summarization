mr @entity6 , of @entity9 , @entity8 who appeared in the witness box in his wheelchair , told the court he thought @entity13 had been taking the cash			1
stolen money : a jury at @entity17 heard how @entity18 had been taking the cash from his bank account while looking after @entity6 but a jury at @entity17 heard yesterday how @entity18 had been taking the cash from his bank account while looking after the pensioner			1
@entity18 was caught slipping the bank card into mr @entity6 's wallet , pretending she was returning cash from a shopping trip			1
she later admitted to stealing £ 300 , claiming she could not pay her rent arrears and feared eviction - but claimed it was the only occasion			2

day , who worked for @entity7 , which is based in @entity8 and supplies domiciliary carers to disabled and vulnerable clients , was sacked immediately			2

prosecutor @entity49 said day , who was on a rota of carers looking after the pensioner , took thousands of pounds without his knowledge			2
he said to day : ' so it was just coincidence was it , that may 21 was the only day you took money and the only day a police officer and social services happened to be there ? ' you were effectively caught red - handed and you knew the game was up			1
' it had been an ideal opportunity for you to take mr @entity6 's card that morning and help yourself to £ 300 and slip it ( the card ) back in a bit later			1
' the money which disappeared was £ 13,200 which , had he been given it as @entity18 claimed , he would have been awash with cash			1
' day claimed she had been evicted a number of years ago and feared she would lose her home again if she did n't pay her rent arrears in the home where she has lived for 17 years			0
the carer claimed mr @entity6 had given her his bank card and she had made the withdrawals over the year - in defiance of her company 's policy - but said it was with his permission			1
she told the jury the money was used to pay for shopping and buying clothing items - sometimes taking out hundreds of pounds			1
she also claimed he gave her a set of keys to let herself into his home			0
the carer claimed on numerous occasions she had failed to fill out a financial transaction form which was required by the company			0
day , giving evidence said : ' i saw an opportunity and i took it and i 've admitted it			0
' i did n't know a police officer would be there when i went round that day			0
' i had every intention to pay the £ 300 back			0
' day was granted bail until the next hearing			0
