@entity0 last night attacked @entity2 judges after they backed a ‘ perverse ’ @entity4 cap on bankers ’ bonuses			1
the chancellor had mounted a legal challenge to the cap but the @entity10 , ruled the curbs were ‘ valid ’ and legal			2
the judgment triggered a furious reaction , with the @entity4 accused of attacking the @entity14 and riding roughshod over @entity16 ’s right to manage its own economy			2
chancellor @entity0 had mounted a legal challenge to the cap but the @entity10 , ruled the curbs were ‘ valid ’ and legal mr @entity0 insisted the @entity22 plan for a cap on bonuses would prove counterproductive because banks would simply pay higher salaries , which could not be clawed back if things go wrong – unlike bonuses			1
but he has now withdrawn his challenge , saying : ‘ i am not going to spend taxpayers ’ money on a legal challenge now unlikely to succeed			0
’ in a letter to @entity35 governor @entity34 he described the ruling as ‘ self - defeating ’ , saying it could ‘ undermine responsibility in the banking system rather than promote it ’ by encouraging higher salaries			0
the ruling by @entity42 , the court ’s advocate general , would make it ‘ more difficult to ensure that the banks and bankers pay when there are mistakes , rather than the taxpayer ’ , he said			0
the cap , enforced at the beginning of the year , restricts banks to paying a maximum bonus of one year ’s salary , rising to twice salary if shareholders approve			2
although the final decision will be made by the @entity10 early next year , it rarely goes against the @entity59 ’s decision			0
the judgment triggered a furious reaction , with the @entity4 accused of attacking the @entity14 and riding roughshod over @entity16 ’s right to manage its own economy mr @entity0 came under fire from @entity65 , with @entity67 defector @entity66 claiming his pledge to renegotiate a better deal with the @entity4 had ‘ all the credibility of a @entity72 government bond ’			1
the lavish bankers ’ bonus culture has been widely blamed for driving the reckless behaviour that ultimately caused the banking sector to implode			0
@entity16 ’s concerns have already been vindicated , with @entity16 banks dodging the bonus cap by paying their top staff seven - figure ‘ fixed allowances ’ to increase their basic packages			1
banks have also warned the bonus cap will prompt talented staff to join @entity87 and @entity88 rivals , putting financial services at a disadvantage			1
the @entity91 launched a legal challenge in september , arguing that the @entity4 had no legal right to introduce pay curbs			2
mr @entity42 admitted that setting the level of pay was ‘ unquestionably a matter for the member states ’ , but added : ‘ fixing the ratio of variable remuneration to basic salaries does not equate to a “ cap on bankers ’ bonuses ” , or “ fixing the level of pay ” because there is no limit imposed on the basic salaries that the bonuses are pegged against			1
’ critics said the bonus cap will mean bankers get paid more even if they perform badly			1
@entity67 @entity113 said : ‘ the investment banking industry is critical to the @entity16 economy			0
it is vital that we – not meddling bureaucrats from @entity22 – control how it is run			0
’ but shadow chancellor @entity120 said it was ‘ a humiliating climbdown ’ for mr @entity0 .			0

@entity124 ’s legal adviser threw out the government **'s** challenge
ministers challenged *proposal* to cap bonuses at 200 *%* of a banker **'s** wage
but @entity4 said the cap is legal because it does not limit bankers ' salaries
@entity138 meant ' bankers would be paid well even if they performed badly '
@entity0 *tonight* *abandoned* fight to *overturn* the bonus cap
