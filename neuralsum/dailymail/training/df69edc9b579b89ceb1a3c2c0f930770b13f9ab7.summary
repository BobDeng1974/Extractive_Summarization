by @entity0 have you ever picked up your suitcase from the airport carousel and had the feeling that someone ’s had a sneaky peek inside ? according to an official report , you could be right			2
it seems that airport officials are rummaging through passengers ’ luggage without telling them			2
officials are allowed to search baggage before it is placed on the carousel			1
one third of searches turn up suspect items , but the other two thirds of cases are repacked and the passenger is not told about the search under little - known powers designed to stop drugs , weapons and other contraband entering the country , customs staff can search bags at ports and airports without informing the owner			1
but border staff have been discovered carrying out the searches without proper authorisation			1
some officials said they would read confidential legal and medical documents if they found them in luggage – despite it being against the law			1
officials can require passengers to open their luggage if they are stopped while walking through the customs channel			2
these searches take place in front of the passenger , who can see when items are being opened			0
but covert luggage searches are carried out on inbound flights after items are taken off planes but before they are placed on the carousel for passengers to collect			2
details of the searches emerged in a report published yesterday by the chief inspector of @entity59 and @entity60 , @entity61			0
from april to september last year hundreds of searches were carried out at regional airports across @entity64			0
it means that every year thousands such searches will take place in our airports			0
in around one in three cases officials found suspect items , but in the remainder the luggage was simply repacked and returned to the passenger , who remained unaware it had ever been inspected			1
mr @entity61 found a worrying lack of consistent rules on how such searches should be conducted across airports			2
his inspection found covert searches took place at @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity90 airports			1
figures for searches at @entity93 , @entity94 or @entity95 were not included			0
at @entity88 staff were conducting searches without seeking approval from managers , who were required by law to sign off on all searches			1
record keeping was so sloppy at @entity86 , @entity88 and @entity90 that in half the notebooks mr @entity61 examined there was no record of who authorised the search			1
staff were also found not to be recording why searches were needed			1
the report said : ‘ staff at @entity86 told us they would be content to examine material they considered to be confidential during a ... baggage examination			1
' examples of confidential material discussed during staff focus groups included passengers ’ personal medical records and legally privileged correspondence			1
’ @entity124 rules state that any searches of confidential personal material need approval by a senior manager and the surveillance commissioner			0
mr @entity61 said it was a ‘ cause for concern ’ that there was no staff guidance on what to do when sensitive personal material was discovered			0
he called for urgent updated guidance for staff on how the powers should be used			0
a report found that staff at @entity140 were not seeking managers ' approval for searches , required under the law , and were also not recording why a search was needed ‘ the power to examine passenger ’s bags without their knowledge requires authorisation and justification			1
it is an intrusive power , but one that is necessary to protect @entity64 border security , ’ he said			0
‘ the @entity124 also needs to ensure that its staff are operating to consistent national standards : standards that are fully supported by current , easily accessible and detailed guidance			0
’ @entity160 , of civil liberties group @entity161 , said : ‘ it is not acceptable for luggage to be searched without a proper process being followed and records being kept			1
‘ @entity166 has totally failed to protect people ’s privacy and if they are incapable of putting adequate safeguards in place then the @entity124 should step in and do it for them			0
’ the @entity166 said it accepted the report ’s recommendations			0
a spokesman added : ‘ the searching of baggage , including when the owner is not present , is a legal and proportionate response to ensuring that illegal goods are prevented from entering the @entity64 and to protect revenue			2
‘ the independent chief inspector recognises that border staff are using these powers proportionately and with high levels of success and identified occasions where their standard of work was “ exceptional ”			0
' this report shows that we are making the right changes and significantly improving performance			0
