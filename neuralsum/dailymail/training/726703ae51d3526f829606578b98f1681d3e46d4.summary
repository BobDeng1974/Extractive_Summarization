brain cancer patient @entity0 has recovered to such a degree that his family hope he will soon be walking unaided			1
the five - year - old , whose parents sparked an international manhunt and fears for his life when they took him out of hospital to seek treatment abroad , is making ‘ steady progress ’ four months after undergoing pioneering proton beam therapy in the @entity11			1
writing on the family ’s @entity14 page , @entity0 ’s older brother , @entity16 , said : ‘ @entity0 ’s progress is steady and hopefully soon he can make his first step alone			1
’ improving : @entity0 , pictured centre , has been in good spirits more recently			2
his father is in the background @entity0 ’s parents , @entity25 and @entity26 , whisked him from @entity27 last august , boarded a ferry and drove 1,300 miles to their @entity30 holiday home			1
their plan was to sell the property to fund the proton beam therapy , which costs at least £ 50,000			1
@entity0 underwent 30 therapy sessions in @entity35 in september and october			1
his parents feared the @entity38 treatment he was due to receive , combining ‘ conventional ’ radiotherapy and chemotherapy , would have damaging side effects			2
@entity43 beam therapy typically causes less damage to surrounding healthy tissue			1
his @entity47 doctors argued it would bring no extra benefits – but the @entity38 did eventually pay for his treatment in @entity35			0
@entity0 also underwent an operation to remove his tumour last summer , appearing very weak afterwards			2
but now he has recovered to such an extent that he is behaving like a normal , boisterous five - year - old , according to worshippers at the church the family attends in @entity58 , near @entity59			0
one described him as ‘ full of life – and even arguing with his parents ’			2
weak : @entity0 when he arrived at a hospital in the @entity11 , to begin pre-cancer treatment in september supportive : five - year - old @entity0 with his parents , @entity25 and @entity26 , in hospital in september meanwhile , leading doctors are warning that ministers are about to squander £ 250 million because the equipment chosen for two proton beam treatment centres in the @entity47 is based on ‘ old technology ’			1
cancer expert professor @entity73 said the enormous facilities , in @entity75 and @entity76 , could soon be ‘ concrete mausoleums ’ , while leading obstetrician sir @entity77 , who delivered @entity78 , said the @entity38 should ‘ seriously consider ’ newer designs			0
the @entity38 has all but chosen @entity81 to supply machines for two centres , but the experts argue that newer , smaller units are available			0
prof @entity73 said : ‘ it ’s illogical to go for the big machines today			0
it ’s old technology , basically , and it ’s been superseded			0
’ he claimed the @entity38 was being over-cautious and was a victim of its own ‘ unbelievably slow ’ buying process			0
the @entity91 said it was satisfied the best equipment was being bought .			0
