for the past decade , a trip to the cinema using two - for - one cinema tickets on a wednesday has become a regular habit for millions of @entity4			2
but now , it ’s curtains for @entity7 , as @entity8 is closing the popular scheme in february 2015			1
when it launched , the offer may have proved an enticing incentive for cinema goers to pick @entity7 as their mobile network of choice			2
no more cheap dates ! @entity8 is ending @entity7 , which for the last decade , has given customers the opportunity to buy two - for - one cinema tickets every wednesday - making date nights cheaper ( stock image ) but now other networks are offering rival incentives and less people are using @entity7 , perhaps streaming films to tablets and @entity24 instead , leading @entity8 to cite ' changing viewing habits ' as the reason for closing the scheme			1
‘ @entity28 at its peak was a massive success and an iconic promotion , ’ @entity8 said			1
@entity8 has promised that there will be a replacement ‘ our brand has changed and our customers ' viewing habits have also evolved so it 's time to move on			1
’ the deal currently gets @entity8 customers a cheap meal at the @entity42 restaurant chain too			1
many fans of the scheme feared that @entity8 might roll the credits on @entity7 , when @entity8 and @entity7 merged in 2010			1
however , @entity8 has promised that there will be a replacement			1
‘ we 're working on new customer entertainment rewards and we 'll provide more details soon			2
’ if the offer does n’t prove as compelling for customers , they may well swap to @entity53 or @entity54 , which offer copycat schemes of @entity7 wednesday			1
@entity54 's @entity56 gives customers special offers on @entity59 cinema tickets , for example			2
if you 're planning on axing mid-week cinema trips in the @entity64 , a £ 16 gadget lets you project films streamed to a smartphone onto any surface			0
made from cardboard , the simple design also claims to amplify the sound without the need for additional wires or a separate sound system			0
the black and white @entity74 is listed on on @entity75 and can be set up ' within minutes , ' according to its maker , @entity77 of @entity78			0
cheap alternative to the cinema ? the @entity74 projector costs less than two trips to the cinema and claims to project films stored on , or streamed to smartphones , onto a chosen surface it has a 10x magnifying lens at the front to increase the video size on a wall and a grip pad on the back to securely hold a smartphone in place			0
the portable gadget costs £ 15.95 ( $ 27 ) , and means you can turn any room in your home into a cinema screen			0
but there are a number compromises			0
for instance , the projection is dim , small , and can often be blurry			0
there are also no volume controls .			0
