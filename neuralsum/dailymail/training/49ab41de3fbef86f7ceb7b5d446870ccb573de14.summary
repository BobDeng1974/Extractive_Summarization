by @entity0 published : 04:20 est , 21 september 2012 updated : 03:51 est , 27 september 2012 a mother in @entity2 still grieving the death of her 22 - year - old son is now faced with a new unwelcome reminder of his suicide : a $ 14,000 tax bill			1
when @entity10 was found dead in late august last year , the government forgave his student loans and the portion of the payments that his mother @entity14 was expected to pay as is protocol			1
but not all of the payments stopped because the @entity18 considers forgiven loans to be a form of taxable income , so now ms friend faces a substantially higher tax bill that she wo n't be able to pay			1
loving mother : @entity22 ( right ) accrued $ 55,400 in loans and interest in order to help her son @entity28 ( left ) pay for his tuition at @entity30 in @entity31 after originally starting college at @entity33 , @entity28 transferred to @entity30 where he was a popular member of the track team and had completed enough credits to graduate			1
he went missing in august 2011 , left a note saying ' sorry guys ' and a message on his @entity39 saying ' i 'm sorry everyone ' , and his body was found on the banks of the @entity43 days later			0
federal policy automatically dismisses any loans taken out by students in the case of their death of permanent disability , and the loans and interest that ms @entity22 had accrued - which totalled $ 55,400 - were also dropped			1
ms @entity22 was far from the only parent to have to rely on this regulation when their child died , as the @entity55 reports that the @entity56 cancelled $ 2.7billion in such loans in 2011			2
the problem that comes with said cancellations is that the amount of those forgiven loans are taxable , and now that means ms friend is faced with a $ 14,000 payment on top of her existing taxes			1
though she has a steady job in the technology department of @entity68 , a mortgage company , both ms @entity22 and her tax preparer do not know what to do about the additional costs			2
tragic : @entity71 , a popular member of the school 's track team , disappeared in august 2011 and his body was found on the shore of the @entity43 ' as far as what i intend to do about it , i have no idea , ' ms @entity22 told the @entity55 ' i do n't think i 've even seen $ 14,000 all at once			2
i do n't want to give the impression that i 'm dirt poor or anything , but i do not have any means of taking on that kind of debt			0
' similar situations happened to the families of @entity87 and @entity88 , students in @entity90 and @entity91 respectively who both died and their parents were left struggling to pay the thousands of dollars of taxes that followed the forgiveness of their loans			2
' while there are options for some borrowers , they are complicated and confusing , ' said @entity102 , a lawyer for the @entity103			0
' it is most unfortunate that the system is set up to wreak great havoc on borrower 's lives at a time when the borrower deserves the most compassion , ' the lawyer told @entity112			0
the confusion and bills just add to the pain that ms @entity22 has tried to deal with over the past 13 months			0
' i do n't think there will ever be closure for what happened			0
it 's something i will have to learn to live with , but it is like throwing salt into a wound , ' ms @entity22 said .			0

@entity10 , 22 , committed suicide shortly before graduating from college
his mother @entity14 had accumulated $ 55,400 in loans and interest to help him pay for school
those loans were forgiven by the government but @entity18 considers that ' gift ' taxable income so she has to pay an additional $ 14,000 more in taxes
