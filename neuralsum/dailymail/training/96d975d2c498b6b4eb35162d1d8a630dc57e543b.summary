' we 're told @entity6 may have been the one who called police to protect herself from paparazzi , and that 's why cops came			1
' they add that the manager did n't know who @entity6 was at first and that he told photographers on scene that he was fine , but that a short time later he started complaining he was injured			2

' but @entity6 did swap seats with her friend after the incident , she was pictured leaving in the driving seat but when she was pulled over by police - her friend was driving			1
