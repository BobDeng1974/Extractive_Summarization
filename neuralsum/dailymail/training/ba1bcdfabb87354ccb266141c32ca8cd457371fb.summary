among the deletions are references to his school results and a section on political gaffes			1
the online encyclopedia had reported details of his time at @entity16 grammar school , saying he had ‘ obtained four o - levels including an a in @entity19 ( @entity20 ) ’			1

the original entry read that in may 2008 he had ‘ taken large donations from companies related to his frontbench portfolio ’ and that this was ‘ potentially damaging for mr @entity0 given the extent of the donations ’			2
the amounts were said to have run into ‘ tens of thousands of pounds ’ and had been from mortgage brokers , an estate agent and a firm of solicitors			0
his side : mr @entity0 , 43 , justified the edits , saying he removed politically biased or unreferenced edits and claiming ' content must be verifiable ' mr @entity0 sent a letter to the parliamentary commissioner in 2008 admitting a potential conflict of interest			1
sources say the reference to the donations was deleted from @entity4 because many of them were set up by his predecessor @entity58			0

it is the second brush mr @entity0 has had with an internet company in the past few days			2
it was reported over the weekend that @entity69 had blacklisted a network of websites run by mr @entity0 ’s family for breaching rules on copyright infringement , but this has been denied by a spokesman			2

mr @entity0 is no longer named on the firm ’s documents			2
mr @entity0 last night told the @entity99 he had not touched the @entity4 site for years			0
he said : ‘ if it was a vanity exercise then i certainly would n’t have got rid of a @entity105 claim that i received an a in @entity107 – sadly for me , i only achieved a @entity101 ‘ everyone knows i ’m not in the least bit embarrassed about my schooling and i am proud to live in a country where people can succeed regardless of their background			0
but these days when i see stuff that ’s blatantly wrong on my wiki page , i just shrug my shoulders			0
if people want to claim i ’m a @entity118 , agnostic or crashed a car into a school wall – all real edits i ’d previously changed – then i just leave them to it			0
’ @entity4 has more than 3.3million @entity123 language articles			0
