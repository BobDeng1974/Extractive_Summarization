walking through the notorious @entity1 in the shadow of @entity3 , 13 - year - old @entity0 took care to put an extra sweater over his @entity7 tracksuit on the way to training			1
to do otherwise would be to invite intimidation or even a beating			2
not because of club affiliations but because blue was the ‘ wrong ’ colour according to gangs who controlled the estate			2
there are many similar stories which help explain why @entity20 ’s most talked about footballer is such a potent mix of ability , stubbornness and vulnerability			1
@entity0 is set to return to @entity7 when @entity27 travel to @entity28 on sunday the 19 - year - old has received heavy criticism after not starting @entity20 's @entity32 qualifier in @entity33 ‘ we can all talk about his tough upbringing			1
he was the one living it , ’ says his first footballing mentor , @entity7 youth coach @entity34			1
‘ he had the talent which coaches see once in a lifetime , if they ’re lucky			2
but he needed support and guidance			2
we only knew half of what went on , otherwise we would have tried to help him even more			2
’ on sunday , 19 - year - old @entity0 is due to return to @entity28 for the first time since he left four years ago to join @entity27 , a move he admits was motivated by a need ‘ to get out of @entity49 ’			1
assuming @entity50 feels the teenager can cope with the emotional baggage of the day , @entity0 will arrive at his old ground with a higher profile than the prime minister			1
he has been caught in the middle of a slanging match between club manager @entity50 and @entity20 boss @entity58 over whether he was too tired to start for his country in @entity33			1
@entity20 manager @entity58 ( left ) and @entity27 boss @entity50 ( right ) have had a war of words @entity0 started @entity20 's @entity32 qualifier against @entity33 in @entity63 on the bench the @entity27 star played in the 5 - 0 win over @entity67 at @entity3 the thursday before @entity34 , who is still at @entity7 as under 21 head coach , remembers vividly the first proper game he saw @entity0 play in			1
‘ it was an under 12 match against @entity71 , ’ he says			2
‘ @entity71 would score , @entity0 would score , @entity71 would score , @entity0 would score			1
‘ i think @entity71 ended up winning 5 - 4 against our one - man team			2
when i got back to the club , i said i ’d just been watching @entity76			2
he was totally running the show			0
’ even then , there was another side to the skinny little kid who was vulnerable and defiant at the same time			0
@entity34 adds : ‘ i remember how good he was because of his athleticism and brightness , but when someone kicked him , he walked off crying			0
‘ it was n’t the physical stuff that caused it			0
i ’d go over to him and say , “ look , you ca n’t walk off , come on ”			0
but he was n’t really hurt by the foul , he was hurt because of losing			0
‘ he knew the rest of the team were n’t on his level			0
he was thinking , “ i am trying so hard , scoring all these goals and they are letting them in , making me lose ”			0
’ it was not long before every club in the country knew about @entity0			1
but his spiky , immature attitude was well - known , too			2
concessions about his behaviour were made at @entity7 , who knew his story , a @entity107 - born kid who moved to @entity49 at the age of five , lost his father early and whose mother — with whom he was close — was often too busy caring for the rest of the family to watch @entity0 play			1
@entity0 played 120 minutes in @entity27 's @entity115 tie against @entity116 that went to extra-time the area surrounding @entity3 in north @entity49 where @entity0 grew up for most other clubs , however , @entity0 represented a major risk			1
remarkably , when he was put up for sale at 15 , only two clubs — @entity27 and @entity123 — backed up their interest with firm bids for @entity20 ’s most talented teenager			1
‘ @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , they all knew about @entity0			1
but their attitude was : “ too small , too much baggage ” , ’ says @entity34			0
‘ at the time , i wanted him to stay at @entity7			1
i persuaded the reserves to give him his debut at 15 so he ’d feel he was being fast - tracked			2
but at one meeting , after training , @entity0 said “ @entity34 , i have to go ”			1
‘ i could see how genuinely upset he was and i thought , “ i ca n’t do that to a kid ” , so we reluctantly agreed to listen to offers			0
‘ now , with hindsight , i can see it was the right thing for him to leave , as much for a change in environment off the pitch			0
’ @entity146 , 20 , who played schools football with @entity0 , believes his friend ’s upbringing has played a key part			1
he took all the pressure that was on him and put it into his football , ’ he says			0
‘ he ’s worked hard ; never took no for an answer			0
he ’s got his reward and he deserves it			0
‘ a lot of people do n’t realise how hard it is to get on in football			0
a few of us managed to stay in there and get a long way and he ’s worked for everything			0
he was never afraid to take things in his own hands			0
’ @entity0 moved to @entity20 from @entity107 aged five , and grew up on the @entity1 a young @entity0 in action for the @entity7 youth team before he made his move to @entity27 when @entity123 initially bid just under the £ 500,000 asking price to try to get a bargain , @entity27 had a clear run for the winger			1
what a bargain he looks now			0
he has already achieved more at @entity174 , good and bad , than most players manage in a lifetime			1
his thrilling club form earned him a place in @entity20 ’s @entity180 team , where it is generally regarded he superseded @entity181 as @entity20 ’s best player			1
less positively , an appearance in court just over a year ago earned a reprimand from @entity50 about his lifestyle , even though assault charges against an ex-girlfriend were dropped			2
he is a father now and can provide a lifestyle he himself never had			0
he has n’t lost his feelings for @entity7			1
‘ he texted me two days after we won the play - off final at @entity3 to get into the @entity194 , ’ says @entity34			1
‘ he ’d been at the match , gone there quietly and watched in one of the corporate boxes			0
my seven - year - old son ca n’t wait to meet him , so we ’ll go down to the @entity27 dressing room afterwards			1
’ if @entity0 plays , his every move is bound to be analysed for signs of fatigue			1
@entity58 claimed he had left @entity0 on the bench in @entity63 because the player said he ’d felt tired			2
@entity27 have turned on the @entity20 manager in fury despite @entity50 warning about the dangers of burn - out all season			1
@entity210 , a football coach at @entity0 ’s old school which is now known as the @entity213 there are other factors at play that have helped the issue escalate			2
@entity50 is furious that his striker @entity218 was injured on @entity20 duty and @entity58 is resentful at the way he was treated as @entity27 boss during his brief , disastrous spell at @entity174			1
the 67 - year - old also has an awkward personal relationship with @entity0 , finding his teenage ways irritable			1
@entity27 and @entity20 team - mate @entity226 , who himself fell out with @entity58 at @entity174 , has come out strongly in support of @entity0 and says the player has been misrepresented , presumably by his international manager			1
‘ the way it ’s been presented , @entity0 was asking for a lie down			2
but obviously anyone with half a brain would know that ’s not the case			0
he ’d play every week if he can , ’ says @entity226			0
‘ he was asked a question “ how does he feel ? ” , and he ’s said his thighs were tired			0
there is a difference between aching and demand a break from games to actually saying “ i ’m tired and i ca n’t play ”			0
‘ you are never 100 per cent , certainly not when you are playing games every four days , you are going to play with knocks and pain and aches			0
i think club and country should support him , support young players			0
with @entity0 , he is still growing , so he is going to have a demand on his body			2
’ the @entity213 in @entity3 where @entity0 used to go to school a certificate from 2007 which shows @entity0 winning a year 7 boys ' high jump competition so , what next for @entity0 ? a new deal at @entity27 is being talked about but remains unsigned			1
interest from @entity261 is genuine but not yet backed up by hard cash			0
@entity7 must hope @entity27 do sell in the summer			1
they would be entitled to 25 per cent of the fee , which would be about £ 60million on current market value			0
but sunday afternoon is about remembering where it all started for @entity0			1
@entity210 , football coach at @entity0 ’s old school , now known as the @entity213 , says : ‘ @entity0 is an inspiration			2
he has gone to the highest level and that allows other kids here to dream			0
he ’s a 19 - year - old boy from @entity272 and he proves that if they ’re serious and put in time and effort , they can achieve what they want			1
‘ there are so many i know who lose heart and stop playing football and do n’t even play on the park with their mates any more			0
’ his school pal @entity146 adds : ‘ in @entity285 , the goals were tape on the walls of the gym and at lunchtime we ’d put down bags and play in the cage with a tennis ball			0
‘ we saw them knock down the old @entity3 and the new one coming to life			2
for a lot of us , it was always our dream to play inside			0
he ’s got true grit			0
