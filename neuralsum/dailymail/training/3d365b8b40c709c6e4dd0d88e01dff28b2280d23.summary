@entity0 have opened preliminary talks with @entity2 over a proposed £ 16m deal for @entity4			1
manager @entity5 is growing impatient over @entity7 's reluctance to bend on a deal for @entity9 , with sporting director @entity10 saying the @entity12 international should stay ' a little longer ' at @entity13 's			1
@entity0 have checked on @entity14 too at @entity15 but @entity17 international @entity16 offers better market value			1
@entity4 started just 10 matches in the @entity36 last season , contributing to @entity2 's title win mainly from the bench			0
he is currently on international duty with @entity26 at the @entity27 in @entity28 and completed the full 90 minutes in their opening 2 - 1 win over @entity43			1
limited opportunities : @entity4 scores for @entity2 against @entity45 last season , but his game time has been limited at the @entity49 champions hard ball : @entity7 are not prepared to budge on the sale of star asset @entity9 @entity0 will also target the @entity55 left - back @entity53 if they fail to agree a deal for @entity57			1
the @entity59 star has been a long - term target for @entity5 but a move to @entity33 appears to have hit the rocks			2
@entity0 thought they had thrashed out terms with the @entity65 side , who have upped their asking price and are now demanding around £ 20million for the 21 - year - old			1
wanted : @entity4 's @entity26 team - mate @entity53 is also been monitored by @entity0 that means @entity5 could turn his attention to @entity72 instead			1
the @entity73 were linked with the 21 - year - old in january , but could reignite their interest if a deal for @entity57 falls through			0
the potential signing of @entity4 is sure to excite @entity0 fans , with the midfield maestro long considered one of the brightest prospects to come out of @entity17 football			2
at just 22 - years - old , @entity4 is already a key figure in the national side and played the full 90 minutes in @entity26 ’s 2 - 1 opening match victory over @entity43 in the @entity27			2
@entity4 burst on the scene as a teenager after making his debut for @entity89 in 2009 , where he quickly cemented his place in the starting line - up over the next three seasons			0
to the delight of @entity73 fans he already has pedigree when it comes to sticking the knife into rivals @entity99			0
surrounded : @entity4 , then playing for @entity100 , takes on the @entity99 defence in a 2011 @entity103 tie the @entity17 star provided two assists for @entity89 in a 2 - 1 victory over @entity99 in 2011 which helped dump the @entity107 out of the @entity103 group stage			0
his performances soon caught the eye of a number of @entity113 clubs , but it was @entity2 which won the race to sign him in the summer of 2012			0
despite his promising talent , @entity4 has struggled to break into an all - conquering @entity2 side that have eased to the @entity49 title for the past two seasons , as well as the @entity103 crown in 2013			0
due to a lack of consistent playing time , the @entity49 side have n’t got the best out of @entity4 who is sure to rediscover his excellent potential with an opportunity of first - team football			0
on target : @entity4 ( left ) celebrates with @entity129 after scoring for @entity26 in a friendly with @entity131 nicknamed the ‘ @entity132 made his international debut at just 18 - years - old , scoring his first international goal shortly after in a 2 - 1 @entity136 qualifying defeat by @entity12			1
@entity4 ’s not going to win many headers standing at just 1.69m , but his weight of 70kg helps provide a low centre of gravity which can make him difficult to shrug off the ball			0
@entity142 at using both feet and possessing excellent vision , @entity4 can play anywhere across the attacking areas of midfield and would add talent and depth to a @entity0 side back in @entity151 this term			2

@entity0 line up @entity26 international in £ 16m deal
