the closure of two @entity2 units has caused chaos at nearby hospitals , leaving them with the longest waiting times in the country , @entity8 can reveal			1
despite assurances that shutting the casualty departments in @entity12 in september would not harm patient care , the newspaper has found that 25 per cent of patients at neighbouring @entity16 and @entity17 hospitals have now been left waiting more than four hours for emergency treatment			1
that is five times the maximum number who should have waited that long under @entity23 targets			0
it is also more than twice the number of patients ( 11 per cent ) who waited more than four hours a year ago – before the two other a&es were shut			2
@entity16 and @entity17 have had to pick up the slack due to the downgrading of @entity2 units at @entity32 and @entity33 hospitals			1
the revelations are a damning indictment of moves to close a&es			0
since the @entity40 in may 2010 , 14 casualty departments across @entity39 have been shut or downgraded to @entity41 , which may only be staffed by nurses at night and are generally not equipped to deal with the most serious cases			2
for more than two years , @entity8 has been campaigning against the closures , which can leave patients having to travel further or wait longer for life - saving treatment			2
around a dozen more fully - equipped @entity27 – including departments in the @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity12 – are currently under threat			2
last night , campaigners accused health bosses of going ahead with the moves despite warnings they could jeopardise patient care			1
@entity57 ( pictured ) and @entity16 hospital have had to pick up the slack due to the downgrading of @entity2 units at @entity32 and @entity33 hospitals two months ago , @entity63 , chief executive of @entity64 – which covers @entity16 and @entity17 hospitals – confidently told @entity8 : ‘ we do not expect a large impact on @entity17 as a result of the closure of @entity32 and @entity2 units			1
’ but campaigner @entity71 said last night that mr @entity63 was ‘ sticking his head in the sand ’ and failing to look at the figures			0
a&es across @entity39 have struggled this year to meet the government target of treating at least 95 per cent of patients within four hours			2
since mid-september , an average of 8.8 per cent nationwide have had to wait more than four hours – up from 7.4 per cent last autumn			0
but at the @entity80 , this figure was an astonishing 25.2 per cent			0
dr @entity81 , a local gp and the @entity84 chairman of the @entity86 ’s @entity85 , said : ‘ the closure of two busy @entity2 units has left the remaining hospitals in @entity12 breaking under the strain			1
it is now clear those closures have resulted in @entity93 having one of the worst @entity2 waiting time records in the country			2
’ @entity17 , earmarked to become one of area ’s ‘ super a&es ’ , appears to have been worst affected by the closure of the units at both @entity33 and @entity32 hospitals			1
a brand new 40 - bay , £ 21 million @entity2 was supposed to open at the site in @entity105 shortly afterwards			0
however , that has now been delayed twice – and there are fears the unit will not start taking patients before @entity111			0
official predictions are that the department , recently lambasted in a @entity115 report for having ‘ inadequate staffing levels ’ , will have to cope with an extra 8,000 patients a year due to the closures			0
downgraded : the closure of two @entity2 units , including at @entity32 ( pictured ) has caused chaos at nearby hospitals , leaving them with the longest waiting times in the country but the @entity126 quango set up to push through the closures , called shaping a @entity128 , says shutting the a&es at @entity33 and @entity32 and replacing them with @entity41 is only the first ‘ phase ’ of its programme			1
it is widely expected that the a&es at @entity135 and @entity136 in @entity137 will lose facilities over the coming years			0
in a joint statement , @entity64 and @entity139 said : ‘ a number of @entity2 departments across the country and across @entity12 are dealing with an increase in activity at the moment – this is certainly not a situation unique to @entity17			1
of course , no one should have to wait more than four hours , and we are tackling that problem			0
‘ the programme of change across @entity93 means we are recruiting more @entity2 consultants and more nurses , @entity17 and @entity16 hospitals are getting significantly more beds , and we are investing in other local health services			1
our new £ 21 million @entity2 department will open in december			0

closure of two @entity2 units causes chaos at nearby hospitals in @entity12
@entity2 units at @entity32 and @entity33 hospitals downgraded
nearby @entity16 and @entity17 hospitals have since picked up the slack
*quarter* of patients there have now been left waiting more than four hours for emergency treatment
comes despite assurances shutting casualty units in would not harm patient care
