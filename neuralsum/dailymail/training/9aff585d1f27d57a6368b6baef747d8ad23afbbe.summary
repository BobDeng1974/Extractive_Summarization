by @entity0 published : 07:35 est , 16 november 2012 updated : 12:27 est , 16 november 2012 at 6ft 8in tall , he would have been easily eligible to compete amongst those giants of sport in the @entity5 basketball leagues today			1
in third - century @entity6 , where men averaged only about 5ft 6in , he would have been a giant the likes of which most people had never seen			1
it 's no legend - archaeologists believe have discovered the first complete ancient skeleton of a person with gigantism near the capital of the ancient empire			1
towering : the giant 's tibia ( shin bone ) , top , compared with one taken from a normal - sized male of the same era and location @entity25 is extremely rare , these days affecting only about three individuals in every million worldwide ; finding such skeletons dating back to ancient times is almost entirely unheard of			2
although two partial skeletons , one from @entity33 and another found in @entity34 , have been identified as possible cases , the @entity31 find is the first clear case of gigantism from the ancient past , @entity29 reported			1
gigantism is a condition leading to excessive growth significantly above the human average			0
it is caused by overproduction of growth hormone in childhood , before growth plates in the bones have closed			0
archaeologists excavating a necropolis in @entity50 , a territory indirectly managed by @entity6 , found the skeleton in 1991 buried in an unusually long tomb			1
but it was only in a later anthropological examination that researchers found the bones were also out of the ordinary			1
a team led by @entity59 , a paleopathologist at the @entity60 , analysed the bones and found evidence of damage to the man 's skull consistent with a tumour on the pituitary gland			1
this would have disrupted the gland , causing it to overproduce human growth hormone and leading to the phenomenal growth			1
disproportionately long limbs and evidence that the youth 's bones were still growing even in early adulthood supported the diagnosis of gigantism			1
the world 's tallest man today : at 8ft 3in tall @entity82 of @entity83 is officially the world 's tallest man			2
he also suffers from pituitary gigantism and the rest of his family are all of normal height gigantism is a condition characterized by excessive growth and height significantly above average			2
in humans , this condition is caused by over-production of growth hormone in childhood before the long bone epiphyses ( growth plates ) close , resulting in individuals between 7 feet and 9 feet in height			2
the term is typically applied to those whose height is not just in the upper 1 per cent of the population but several standard deviations above mean for persons of the same sex , age , and ethnic ancestry			0
gigantism is usually caused by a tumor on the pituitary gland of the brain , although in some cases the condition can be passed on genetically through a mutated gene			1
many of those who have been identified with gigantism have suffered from multiple health issues involving their circulatory or skeletal system			2
dr @entity59 told @entity29 that evidence also showed the man died young - most likely between 16 and 20 - another finding that could point to the condition , which is linked to a number of health problems			0
with imperial @entity31 high society having what dr @entity59 described as a ' pronounced taste for entertainers with evident physical malformations ' it is more than likely the @entity50 giant was the subject of much curiousity during his life			0
however , little could be gleaned about what his life was like from the circumstances of his burial			0
he was found with no funerary artifacts , which often offer clues about the status of people in the @entity31 world , although the typical circumstances of his interment suggest he was not excluded from the daily life of his community			2
but researchers hope that further investigation of the body will help them better understand how gigantism has developed throughout human history			0
@entity160 , a bioarchaeologist at the @entity161 , told @entity29 : ' normally a doctor will be looking at a patient with a disease over short term span			0
' we 've been able to look at skeletons from archaeological sites that are thousands of years old			0
you can start to look at trends of how diseases have changed in frequency over time			0
' the study by @entity174 and her team appears in the @entity176 .			0

skeleton of youth who stood 6ft 8in tall found near @entity6 in unusually long tomb
analysis shows he suffered from a tumour on his pituitary gland
