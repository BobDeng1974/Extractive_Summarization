by @entity0 published : 09:25 est , 24 september 2013 updated : 09:28 est , 24 september 2013 @entity1 died of a heart attack after suffering a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm			1
it is believed he would have survived if he had been able to have surgery quickly a grieving daughter has accused the @entity7 of running a monday to friday service , blaming the death of her sport - loving father on @entity12 ’s ‘ healthcare lottery ’			1
@entity1 , 65 , died as he was being transferred between hospitals as there were no surgeons available at the first because it was a weekend			1
the father - of - four collapsed with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm as he refereed a football match - and had a 70 per cent chance of surviving a routine operation on it			1
but he suffered a heart attack in the ambulance taking him from @entity25 to @entity26			1
paramedics managed to revive him but his heart stopped again before he could be operated on			2
his death was recorded at 6.15pm - two hours after he first arrived at @entity25			1
an inquest was triggered when his daughter @entity31 , 43 , lodged a formal complaint			2
after the case she said : ‘ i do n’t want my father to be another statistic			2
‘ i hope what has happened highlights the fact that the @entity7 as it stands is a monday to friday service			0
‘ if my father had collapsed on a weekday then the outcome would have been very different			2
‘ if he had been operated on straight away he would have most likely survived the operation but there were no surgeons working at the hospital in @entity25 that weekend			1
‘ he was taken to @entity46 because it was the nearest hospital but they did n’t have the means to treat him			2
‘ at the time it was a real shock but i am not angry with the hospitals or the staff involved with what happened			0
it ’s the system which needs to change			0
‘ the healthcare service should not be part - time			0
i ’m aware that the government needs to make cuts to save money but this should not be at the expense of patients			0
’ she added : ‘ being angry and placing blame does n’t bring my father back but i hope something good can come out of his death			0
‘ i hope that what happened might bring change to the system so another family does n’t have to suffer like ours has			0
‘ it has completely destroyed our family and it was something that could have easily been avoided			0
’ when he collapsed , mr @entity1 was rushed to @entity25			1
he was diagnosed quickly but the hospital did not have a surgeon on site as it was the weekend so he had to be transferred to @entity26			1
he died en route @entity31 , a company director , said despite sending a letter of complaint to the hospital , she has never received a response			1
she said : ‘ at the inquest i learnt that if there had been someone there to operate , there was a 70 per cent chance he would have lived			2
‘ the operation is really simple and only takes around 40 minutes but it was the delay which killed him			0
‘ to treat a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm it is like mending a pipe and the vast majority of people make a full recovery from it			1
’ the inquest in @entity25 last week heard that mr @entity1 , a ‘ well and active man ’ from pool - in - @entity95 , @entity96 , had been diagnosed within 20 minutes of arriving at @entity25			1
@entity97 , a surgical registrar with the @entity98 at the time , said the transfer represented his best chance			0
he said : ‘ our vascular surgical cover that day was provided by @entity26			1
‘ our view was that a blue - light ambulance transfer would be more rapid than having a surgeon driving across [ to @entity25 ]			1
” consultant vascular surgeon at @entity107 and @entity108 , @entity109 , told the inquest that the two hospitals took turns to provide acute care cover as part of a formal network arrangement			1
mr @entity1 's daughter , @entity31 , said : ' i hope what has happened highlights the fact that the @entity7 as it stands is a monday to friday service			1
if my father had collapsed on a weekday then the outcome would have been very different ' assistant coroner @entity125 said : ‘ i am satisfied the decision to transfer the patient , though clearly associated with some risk , was appropriate			2
‘ the original assumption that this death was from natural causes must still stand			0
’ but he also asked the @entity133 to examine and consider adopting the arrangements some other regions have where paramedics can , based on their diagnosis , take patients to the most appropriate , rather than nearest , hospital			2
he concluded : ‘ the family will inevitably find it distressing to know that if the vascular surgery team had been at @entity25 mr @entity1 would have expected earlier surgery and , on the balance of probabilities , would have survived			1
‘ that , however , is not an issue that can appropriately be addressed by the individuals in this room			0
’ mr @entity1 left a widow , @entity151 , and his daughter said his death had had a devastating impact on the whole family			2
she added : ‘ my father was a very charitable man who would do anything for anyone			0
he was very family orientated and was very involved in community life			0
‘ he had worked for @entity160 for most of his life and he did n’t deserve this kind of treatment			0
‘ i hope that people in power will take note of this and make the @entity7 a 24/7 service			0
‘ i know the economy is in a bad way at the moment but savings should be made from elsewhere			0
’ @entity31 said she now plans to contact @entity174 ministers directly .			0
