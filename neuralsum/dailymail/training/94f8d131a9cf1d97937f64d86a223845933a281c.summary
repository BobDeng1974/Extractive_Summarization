by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor fracking could decide the next election , it was claimed today with more than three - quarters of the @entity6 ' top target seats been opened up for oil and gas exploration			1
energy minister @entity8 struggled on live radio this morning to name a single village which would welcome fracking on their doorstep , as @entity17 claimed dozens of marginal seats were at risk , @entity16 mps called for more financial compensation for areas which could be chosen as drilling sites			1
the government today launched the latest bidding round for onshore oil and gas licences , which covers around half the country			0
shale gas development will be all but banned in @entity28 and other protected countryside – and permitted only in ‘ exceptional circumstances ’			1
the move from the @entity32 is likely to be seen as an attempt to head off a potential revolt in @entity35 over fracking in the run up to next year ’s election			0
but @entity17 warned that the licensing area also covered freshwater aquifers and intruded on 10 national parks			2
the government has committed to going ' all out for shale ' , claiming development of the gas and oil resource is needed to improve energy security , boost jobs and the economy and bring down energy prices			1
but opponents say it causes disruption and damaging development in the countryside , can cause minor earthquakes and the risk of water pollution , and that exploiting new oil and gas resources is not compatible with tackling climate change			1
mr @entity8 , appointed energy minister in this month ’s reshuffle , was challenged on @entity63 to name anywhere which is ' welcoming the frackers in ' he just changed the subject			1
he added : ‘ there is the potential under the land			0
now , it is only potential ; we ’ve got to get out and explore where it is , but i ’m also determined that we should do this in a way that is sensitive			0
‘ for instance , we ’ve increased the planning guidelines , the protections on national parks and on areas of outstanding national beauty in order to do this in a sensitive way because we ’ve got to make the most of the energy resources that we ’ve got as a country , but we ’ve also got to protect our beautiful countryside			1
’ three areas of @entity91 , in the north and south of @entity94 and in @entity95 , have been identified by the @entity96 ( @entity96 ) as prospective areas for shale gas and oil			1
drilling : proponents of fracking claim is will slash bills , create jobs and deliver energy security carried away : police remove a protester from a fracking site			2
today ti will be announced the controversial process is to be curbed but the latest licensing round opens up a far larger area for potential fracking or other oil and gas exploration - though it is likely that energy companies will focus on areas where resources are easiest to access			1
analysis by @entity17 suggests that 24 of the 31 constituencies represented by mps who are in the @entity122 are affected by the new licence area , while 31 out of 40 target seats in the @entity16 's 2015 election strategy are also affected			2
the licencing area reaches into 92 per cent of @entity130 - held seats , covering 506 constituencies in total , affects 10 out of 13 national parks , 47 per cent of major aquifers and all 10 of the @entity91 's largest cities , @entity17 said			2
@entity17 @entity91 energy campaigner @entity134 said that putting out the new licensing round after mps had gone on their summer holidays showed how ' politically toxic ' an issue fracking had become			1
' just a few months ago ministers were falling over each other to make big announcements about shale gas			1
' now , with mps in @entity16 heartlands feeling the heat and all but seven cabinet ministers threatened by drilling in their constituencies , there could be a high political price to pay for this shale steamroller at next year 's general election			0
' @entity17 produced this map to show how constituencies will be affected by fracking			2
the orange areas are where 14th round licenses have been issued , the red cubes are territories licensed in previous rounds @entity16 mp @entity162 warned fracking would be a ‘ serious ’ issue in his @entity165 and @entity166 constituency at the next election			2
he told @entity63 ’s @entity168 : ‘ we still believe there should be a greater payback to local areas			0
' in @entity173 , we 've been used to coalmining , we 've got nuclear , we 're covered by wind turbines on sea and hills			0
‘ so this kind of industry is not particularly new and one can see the possibility of jobs			0
but there still is some concerns about the environmental damage and some concerns about what is the payback			0
’ cllr @entity187 , from the @entity188 , said : ‘ communities , through their democratically - elected councils and the planning system , will decide whether fracking is right for them			0
‘ given the significant tax breaks being proposed for the firms involved and likely returns , an offer from the industry to local communities of one per cent of revenues and compensation schemes is not enough , and we are seeking a better deal for residents if extraction of oil and gas takes place			0
’ the analysis by @entity17 comes after a @entity210 poll of more than 1,000 people in the 40 most marginal constituencies found low support for fracking from voters across the political spectrum			1
the poll for industry body @entity218 found that just 15 per cent of those intending to vote @entity16 thought developing shale oil and gas was a top priority for ensuring energy security , compared to 43 per cent who thought the greatest focus should be on more renewables			2
of those planning to vote @entity228 , just 11 per cent put fracking for shale as a top priority , while 52 per cent listed developing new renewables as the highest priority			0
would - be @entity130 and @entity234 voters were also much more in favour of renewables than fracking .			0

@entity17 claims marginal seats most at risk from fracking
shale gas development will be banned in protected countryside
controversial process will now only be allowed in ' exceptional ' situations
attempts to start fracking in @entity249 drew the *wrath* of thousands
