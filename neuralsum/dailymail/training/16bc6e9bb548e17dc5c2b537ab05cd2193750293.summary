barely 10 minutes had gone when @entity0 left his seat and adopted an uneasy stance on the touchline , a few yards from @entity5 , who was already beginning to look like a red card in a white shirt			1
@entity0 ’s team selection had been bold and here it was in danger backfiring			1
it seemed a matter of when not if @entity5 would commit the foul which cut short his first start for his country			2
fortunately for all concerned , the quiet word , or the sight of @entity18 being sent out to warm up , did the trick			0
it needs more work and it has defensive frailties			0
@entity36 is not a natural @entity37 with his instinct to carry the ball , not pass it on , but even during the course of the game , it was possible to see @entity0 ’s players coming to terms with a system designed to offer more freedom to @entity47			1
in the first half @entity47 was too often smothered and roughed - up in congested areas			0
later in the game , he became influential			2
he was involved in both goals and was a real threat once @entity21 were ahead and the @entity52 pushed forward			2
booked : @entity5 was given a yellow card after just nine minutes penalty appeal : @entity5 could have earned @entity21 a spot kick when he was challenged by @entity56 hitting the front : how two - goal hero @entity58 gave @entity21 the lead in @entity60 if it is to work , @entity0 needs those on outside of his diamond to have the legs to cover ground and quality to keep the ball			1
@entity69 has established himself in the last 12 months and last night @entity5 repaid @entity0 ’s faith			1
this was not the first time he has trusted youth and inexperience at vital moments in defiance of his reputation for caution			2
he threw 18 - year - old @entity80 into the first game of @entity82 and the hardest fixture of the group , against @entity85			2
it was @entity97 ’s first competitive international , just as it was for @entity47 when @entity0 moved @entity88 left in order to play the teenager in the @entity92 role , against @entity93 in the @entity95 opener in @entity96			1
his gamble last year on @entity99 was a spectacular success			0
the @entity102 winger sparkled on debut and scored the third in a 4 - 1 win against @entity106 , @entity21 ’s penultimate @entity95 qualifier and one they had to win			1
commited : the @entity109 midfielder gave an impressive performance against @entity111 goal : @entity5 celebrates with @entity21 goalscorer @entity58 @entity114 @entity21 players stepped up - @entity0 last night in @entity116 , it was a game they could not afford to lose			1
out went the flying wingers and in came @entity5 for his second cap , after a promising 21 minutes as a substitute against @entity122 last week			1
he opened with an explosive burst down the flank left past adventurous right - back @entity125 and a quick snap into a clean challenge to win the ball from @entity130 in midfield			0
on the ball he was sure and confident			0
he passed it well and linked up with @entity134			0
off it , he simmered with aggression and a thread of recklessness which rarely goes down well with officials in @entity141 football			0
@entity143 referee @entity142 needed less than nine minutes to show @entity5 his yellow card			1
it was for late sliding tackle which took over @entity125 , and it might have been worse			0
@entity142 would have been within his rights to book him moments when he cut through @entity149 from behind			0
fortunately , the referee played the advantage and the angry reaction from the crowd had been quelled by the time he came to tick off the @entity109 midfielder			1
this fearless tenacity has always been part of the appeal			0
he was still a youth team player at @entity158 when he wiped out manager @entity159 in a training game			1
@entity159 being @entity159 was impressed and quickly promoted him			0
tackle : @entity21 's new star goes in strongly on @entity125 line up : @entity5 ( bottom right ) was rewarded for some impressive performances for @entity109 after this breakthrough at @entity167 and a £ 6million transfer to @entity109 , he was soon tipped for the international stage but injuries and instability at his club interfered			1
having finally made the step , his exuberance was perhaps understandable			0
@entity5 continued to hurtle into challenges , ever keen to launch into a slide tackle			2
@entity0 must have toyed with the idea of an early change , but eventually @entity5 settled down and so did @entity21			1
it might have happened sooner had the team taken one of its early chances and soothed the nerves before the first of @entity58 ’s goals			0
by the end , he seemed entirely at home			0
there was no suggestion of him coming off as @entity0 made changes			2
he ran for miles and made contributions in both penalty boxes			0
there was a good block to deny @entity196 and a good shout for a penalty , 10 minutes from time			2
in a department where @entity21 are painfully thin , here was a big bonus for @entity0 .			1

@entity5 made his competitive @entity21 debut after pulling on the @entity21 for the first time against @entity122 last week
the midfielder was booked after just nine minutes in @entity60
but the @entity109 player grew into the game and provided energy to @entity21 's midfield
a bonus for @entity0 in an area where the team is thin following the *retirements* of @entity217 and @entity218
