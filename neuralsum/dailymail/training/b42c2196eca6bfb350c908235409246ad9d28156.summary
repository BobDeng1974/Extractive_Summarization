by @entity0 @entity2 president @entity1 tearfully apologised today for a ferry disaster that killed about 300 passengers and said she would break up the coastguard for failing in its duties			1
@entity9 has been hit hard by an angry nationwide outcry over the government 's response to @entity2 's worst civilian maritime disaster in 20 years and the seemingly slow and ineffective rescue operation			1
polls show support for @entity9 has dropped by more than 20 points since the april 16 disaster			1
she fought back sobs as she remembered some of the teenagers who perished trying to help one another , calling them heroes in an unprecedented show of emotion			2
@entity9 , who is serving a single five - year term , is the daughter of @entity9 , the former military strongman who ruled for nearly two decades in the 1960s and 1970s			0
she lost both her parents to assassins			0
at least 286 people were killed and 18 remain missing			1
only 172 people were rescued , with the rest presumed to have drowned			2
of the passengers , 339 were children and their teachers on a field trip from a high school on the outskirts of @entity25			2
@entity9 vowed sweeping reforms to improve oversight , as well as tough punishment for bureaucrats and businesses whose negligence endangers public safety			0
investigators believe that the @entity22 ferry , pictured , capsized last month as the ship was carrying excess cargo ' a 20 - year - old vessel was bought and refurbished to add excessive capacity , then it was loaded with much more cargo than allowed with a false reporting on weight , but not a single person in the position to supervise stopped any of it , ' @entity9 said			1
she singled out structural problems within the coast guard as the main reason why there was such a high casualty toll from an accident that played out on national television as the vessel gradually sank with most of the passengers trapped inside			1
' had there been an immediate and proactive rescue operation after the accident , we would have been able to reduce the casualties , ' @entity9 said			0
the coast guard 's rescue duties would be transferred to a national emergency safety agency to be set up and the national police will take over its investigative function , she said			0
relatives holding portraits of their children who perished when the @entity22 ferry sank with the loss of around 300 lives stage a sit - in protest demanding to see @entity2 president @entity1 in @entity25 a protestor puts up yellow origami boats on the side of a police vehicle while relatives with children who perished when the @entity22 ferry sank some of the crew , including the captain , were caught on videotape abandoning ship while the children were repeatedly told to stay put in their cabins and await further orders			1
@entity9 has apologised in person to many family members of the victims but her administration has faced continued criticism and nationwide anger for its handling of the disaster			1
@entity9 's public support has dropped to 46 percent , from 70 percent before the accident , according to a recent poll			0
her formal apology and the blueprint for bureaucratic reform have been criticised for coming too late , while her decision to break up the coast guard has also been questioned			0
abandon ship : apparently wearing no trousers , @entity135 , 68 , is seen clambering over the heavily - listing vessel 's rails as he is helped onto a lifeboat while the ferry is still above water saving himself : he is then helped onto a life raft leaving hundreds of passengers behind @entity145 ( centre ) , captain of @entity148 which sank at sea off @entity150 , is seen as he is sent to a prosecutor 's office in @entity153 , @entity2 arrest : @entity135 , centre , was pictured being led towards a court in @entity153 , south of @entity25 , following his arrest ' although we need to integrate government functions on safety and disaster management , dissolving the coast guard all of sudden can make more problems that may be difficult to fix , ' said professor @entity162 of @entity163			1
@entity9 said the coast guard had not only failed in its search and rescue duty but that , in its current form , it would be unable to prevent another large - scale disaster			1
' the coast guard continued to get bigger in size but did not have enough personnel and budget allocated for maritime safety , and training for rescue was very much insufficient , ' she said			0
all 15 surviving crew members were indicted last week , including the captain and three senior crew members on homicide charges			2
the remaining 11 crew were indicted for negligence			0
the prosecution says the ferry was structurally defective after a remodelling to add capacity and was massively overloaded with cargo			2
a sharp turn then caused it to list and capsize			0
