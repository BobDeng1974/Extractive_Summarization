by @entity0 for centuries the @entity1 has largely depicted the crucifixion of @entity3 with his arms outstretched horizontally on a cross			1
but scientists believe that death by crucifixion may have been even crueller , and that a victim ’s arms were probably nailed above their head			1
an international team studying the @entity13 , which appears to depict a man who was put to death by crucifixion , said that no matter who created it , the artefact suggests that the practice involved a victim who was suspended in a y - shape			1
they came to this conclusion after studying lines of ' blood ' down the arms , which can be seen in this image the @entity13 is a 14ft ( 4.3 metre ) long piece of linen that appears to show the faint imprint of a man bearing wounds consistent with crucifixion			1
some people believe it shows the image of @entity3 , while others think it is a medieval forgery of cloth wrapped around a body after crucifixion			2
the @entity13 is the most studied artefact in human history but its age remains in dispute			2
radiocarbon dating of the cloth carried out by the @entity61 in 1998 found it was only 728 years old			0
but a recent study claims that an earthquake in @entity64 in @entity65 that could have created the image and skewed dating results			0
professor @entity69 , from the @entity70 , said : ' we believe it is possible that neutron emissions by earthquakes could have induced the image formation on the @entity13 's linen fibres , through thermal neutron capture on nitrogen nuclei , and could also have caused a wrong radiocarbon dating , ' @entity68 reported			2
@entity80 has attracted widespread interest ever since @entity82 took the first photograph of it in 1898 which showed details which could not be seen by the naked eye			0
the @entity88 has never said whether it believes the shroud to be authentic			0
the @entity13 is the most studied artefact in history and opinion is divided as to whether it was created in medieval times as a kind of hoax or whether it really shows the face of @entity3 , as some believe			1
whatever the case , the linen cloth , which is imprinted with the faint image of a naked man , seems to show lines of blood that have streamed down his arms as well as other wounds			1
regardless of whether the @entity13 is biblical or medieval , @entity106 at @entity108 @entity107 told @entity110 that ‘ it ’s a very interesting piece of art and human ingenuity ’			1
he set out to find whether the ‘ bloodstains ’ on the left arm matched up with the flow of blood from a crucified person			2
to investigate , another researcher from the @entity119 , @entity120 , assumed different crucifixion poses while donated blood trickled down his arm from a place where the shroud shows a nail was hammered through the hand			1
the duo found that the ‘ blood ’ marks on the shroud correspond to a crucifixion – but only if a person was nailed onto a cross in a ‘ y ’ position instead of a ‘ t ’ position , as depicted in most @entity138 art. the scientists set out to find whether the ' bloodstains ' on the @entity13 flow of blood from a crucified person			1
by safely simulating different positions of crucifixion they worked out that the man wrapped in the legendary cloth must have been crucified in a y - shape position , pictured right the majority of @entity138 art shows @entity3 stretched into a t - shaped position on the cross , such as this famous painting by @entity154 , which is housed in @entity156 , @entity157 some artists have chosen to represent @entity3 on the cross with his hands nailed above his head , such @entity164 ' @entity163 scene ( pictured left ) which was painted in the 17th century , with other artists choosing to show @entity3 's arms in a shallow v - shape , like @entity169 's image painted at around the same time dr @entity106 said : ‘ this would have been a very painful position and one which would have created difficulty breathing			1
’ it is thought that someone crucified in a ‘ y ’ position would have died from asphyxiation			0
the imprint on the @entity80 does not correspond with many traditional artistic images of crucifixion but @entity183 - a 16th century @entity184 painter - shows @entity3 crucified in a y - shape			1
his painting , ' @entity186 ' is pictured he explained to a february meeting of the @entity189 in @entity190 that similar positions were used in medieval torture , where victims were suspended from a beam from their wrists , which were tied with rope			2
so if the @entity80 is indeed a medieval forgery , it may be an interpretation of contemporary practice , rather than that of biblical times			0
the results of the experiment back up earlier work by a @entity207 - based doctor called @entity208 who suggested that the person depicted in the shroud was crucified in a y - shape			1
in his study , dr @entity208 said : ‘ the blood - flow is absolutely consistent with what you see on the @entity13			1
' @entity217 doctor @entity216 , who has studied the @entity13 , said : ‘ the imprint on the @entity80 does not correspond with many traditional artistic images of crucifixion			2
’ while the majority of @entity138 art shows @entity3 stretched into a t - shaped position on the cross , some painters , including @entity183 , depicted @entity3 with his arms above his head on the cross			1
dr @entity106 believes that the person who made the shroud must have been a skilled forger ( if it is not ' real ' ) to show the correct blood spatter for a crucifixion – or they stumbled across it by chance			2
‘ it could be that the artist just decided to draw the rivulets of blood parallel to the arms for artistic reasons , ’ he said			0
in @entity244 there was a common way to put people on the cross , @entity106 told @entity248			2
‘ the vertical stake was fixed to the soil in an area usually devoted to capital punishments , while the horizontal branch , called the patibulum , was carried on by the person who was to be crucified			0
’ ‘ theoretically this was the rule , but @entity258 historian @entity257 ( @entity259 ) reported how in the war against @entity262 in 70 ad , @entity258 soldiers enjoyed crucifying prisoners on trees in the most painful and strange positions			0
’ dr @entity106 explained that there are only short passages of writing from ancient authors about crucifixion , probably because the technique was a well - known way to sentence someone to death – ‘ but it was also a very infamous way to die			0
’ dr @entity276 conducted ‘ extensive suspension studies ’ that explained the higher the upper limbs are , more painful the ‘ y ’ position is			0
dr @entity106 said : ‘ we can imagine that it became more difficult for the subject to breath , but this problem could be avoided or partially reduced allowing the prisoner to have a rest thanks to the sedile - a small step behind his pelvis - that could be used as a sort of chair			0
‘ we have some reports of cruciarii ( victim of crucifixion ) that stayed on the cross for some days and this could be related to the use of the sedile , ’ he said			0
the reason for the procedure was likely not merciful but designed to prolong the pain of the victim and their exposure to the sun , as well as their humiliation ‘ partially starving him but also creating muscular pain to him due to the uncomfortable position of upper and lower limbs ’			0
if authorities wanted the victim ’s death to be quicker , they might have positioned them in a high ‘ y ’ position and broken their legs , which would have increased breathing difficulty and accelerated death , dr @entity106 explained			0
dr @entity276 said in his research that this approach was a way to create a fatal shock in the prisoner			0
brutal : in the experiment , a researcher from the @entity119 , @entity120 , assumed different crucifixion poses while donated blood trickled down his arm from a place where the @entity13 shows a nail was hammered through the man 's hand ( pictured )			1

the @entity13 , which appears to show crucified man , suggests that the victim was suspended from a cross in a y - shape , scientists claim
researchers from @entity108 @entity107 and the @entity119 , @entity120 , used donated blood to simulate blood trickling down arms
it is not known whether the @entity13 is medieval or is older , but it could suggest that many artworks showing the death of @entity3 are *inaccurate*
