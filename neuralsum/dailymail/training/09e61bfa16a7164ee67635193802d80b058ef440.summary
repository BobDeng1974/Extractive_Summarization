she said : ‘ we could not understand it			0
‘ she had been unable to walk for the past three years and had never fallen from her chair at home			0

mrs @entity1 was admitted to the hospital with an infection but fell out of bed the next day			1
she cut her head but it took medics two days to stitch it up because of a ' disagreement ' ‘ but it was when i saw her on the hospital ward that the shock set in			1

it also ordered staff draw up clear lines of responsibility for the assessment and stitching of wounds sustained in falls			0
the use of agency staff was recommended to be kept to a minimum , and the review also said staff should be reminded of the need to keep clear and detailed notes			0
@entity58 coroner @entity163 said she felt the @entity47 had improved its record on falls from hospital beds			0
she said : ‘ @entity47 has shown a raised awareness of the issue of falls within their hospitals			0
‘ they have taken careful note of the difficulties they have faced and how they have been addressing those difficulties , looking the issues generally and as part of a learning process when patients have fallen resulting in serious injuries or even death			0
‘ over this two - year period we have seen huge improvements in the trust 's efforts to minimise falls including work done to formulate clear policies and procedures and risk assessments			2
’ @entity3 's @entity2 has apologised to mrs @entity1 's family and says that it has made a number of improvements since her death mr @entity132 said : ' i wish to reiterate the @entity47 ’s deepest apologies to mrs @entity1 ’s family that she fell when in our care and sustained serious injuries			1
