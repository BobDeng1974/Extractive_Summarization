by @entity0 published : 01:44 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 10:19 est , 7 january 2014 almost a winner : @entity5 alum @entity4 bet $ 100 on @entity5 to win at 500/1 odds , they led after the third quarter but ultimately lost the game an @entity5 fan almost won more than $ 50,000 for placing a bet on monday 's @entity11 game before the teams playing in it were even decided			1
@entity4 bet on december 1 $ 100 that @entity5 would win the @entity14 at 500/1 odds - the payout would have been $ 50,100 if the @entity16 had won			1
but his chances were dashed after @entity18 scored the go - ahead touchdown to put @entity18 up 34 - 31 with only 13 seconds remaining			1
mr @entity4 graduated from @entity5 in 1998 , and had previously won a bet on them winning the national title in 2010 , according to @entity23			1
he placed the bet on tonight 's game on dec 1 , before it was even known if @entity5 would be in the national title game			1
the @entity5 alum did not win the $ 50,100 , but he did collect $ 2,000 earlier in the game - so it was n't a total loss			1
' i caught @entity18 at even money early in the game for $ 2k , ' he wrote on @entity33			2
' so that should make some of you feel better			0
' @entity38 , @entity18 's @entity37 winning quarterback had other ideas though			1
he threw a 2 - yard touchdown pass to @entity41 with 13 seconds left and no. 1 @entity18 beat no. 2 @entity5 34 - 31 to win the last @entity14 on monday night			1
the winning toss capped a tumultuous 12 months that saw him face rape allegations , win the @entity37 as college football 's best player and go undefeated to win the college football championship			1
a pass interference penalty on @entity5 's @entity61 gave @entity18 a first - and - goal at the 2 and on the next play @entity38 hit his big receiver for the touchdown			1
' i said this from day 1 in spring ball			0
these kids are special , ' coach @entity74 said			0
' this group never faltered			0
they wanted to be elite			0
they wanted to go to the top and there 's so much character in this group			0
' @entity83 had given @entity5 ( 12 - 2 ) a 31 - 27 lead with a 37 - yard touchdown run with 1:19 left after @entity86 had put @entity18 in the lead for the first time since the first quarter with a 100 - yard kickoff return to make it 27 - 24 with 4:31 left			1
@entity83 ran for 195 yards			0
@entity38 was 20 for 35 for 237 yards and two fourth - quarter touchdown passes			2
cool as a cucumber : mr @entity38 throws a pass in the fourth quarter against @entity5 - he went 6 for 7 on the game - winning drive the perfect birthday present : mr @entity38 lifts the @entity52 while surrounded by teammates after the @entity54 @entity14 @entity99 ran for a touchdown and threw scoring passes to @entity83 and @entity102 in the first half , and @entity5 led 21 - 13 after three quarters			1
it was after that third quarter that a picture of a betting slip began circulating around @entity33			0
all - america kicker @entity109 's second field goal of the night accounted for the only third - quarter points for either team as both defenses took charge after a frenetic first half			0
the powerful @entity58 trailed by 18 points in the second quarter and 21 - 10 at halftime , but picked up momentum in the third quarter with solid defensive play and improvements by @entity38 , who was fighting a case of big - game jitters			2
@entity122 did n't go down without a fight : @entity5 's @entity83 scores a touchdown against the @entity58 in the fourth quarter uncertain future : where mr @entity38 goes from here is anybody 's guess - he has suitors in both @entity130 and the @entity131 the @entity37 - winning freshman went 6 for 15 for 62 yards in the first half on his birthday , with a key fumble setting up @entity99 's 4 - yard td run 5:01 before halftime			1
mr @entity38 also led a 66 - yard scoring drive late in the first half and consistently moved @entity18 in the third quarter â € ” but with only three points to show for it			2
after trailing for the first time in any game since sept. 28 , @entity18 needed a big finish to become the first team to rally from a halftime deficit to win the @entity11 title game			2
the end of the season brings a host of questions for the embattled , and battle - tested , @entity18 quarterback			2
will he stay in college or declare himself eligible for the @entity156 ? he is not assured of being a number one pick when going up against @entity160 's qb @entity159 or @entity162 's @entity161 - should he also declare			0
the perfect setting : the @entity14 was played at the @entity164 , in @entity55 , @entity56 will the rape allegations from last year hurt his draft stock ? that cloud may never lift from mr @entity38 's head , and time will only tell how @entity131 teams feel about his character when making draft picks when mr @entity38 does decide to go pro. will he also pursue a baseball career ? the @entity176 have been adamant about signing the two sport collegiate star and developing him in the mold of famous two sport stars @entity180 and @entity181			1
the challenge to mr @entity38 being a two sport star is that neither mr @entity180 nor mr @entity181 was a quarterback , as the @entity183 noted			0
but mr @entity38 seems undeterred			0
' i want to be better than @entity180 , ' mr @entity38 told reporters in @entity186 before receiving the @entity37 last month , according to the paper			2
' of course , i want to keep doing both			0
thatâ € ™ s my dream			0
' his stock may never be higher , but that does n't mean he 's ready to bolt @entity18 's @entity194 campus just yet			0
one thing is certain , he ca n't defend his @entity11 title because college football is moving to a playoff system next season .			2

@entity18 beat @entity5 34 - 31 to win the last - ever @entity14 game
