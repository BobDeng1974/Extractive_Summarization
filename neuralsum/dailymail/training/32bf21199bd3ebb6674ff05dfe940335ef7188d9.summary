for it to finally happen is very exciting			0
' @entity0 undoubtedly has huge potential but still has plenty to prove after a meagre goalscoring return during his time at @entity42			2
the @entity13 forward notched just 29 goals in 142 first - team appearances for @entity5 , albeit with many of those coming from the substitutes bench or while shunted out on the wing playing a support role to @entity51 and @entity52			1
the 23 - year - old has craved a genuine opportunity to prove himself as a top - class central striker , which he should now get at @entity2 with @entity57 out for four months with an ankle injury			1
and @entity0 has promised that he can be a roaring success while feeding off chances created by the likes of @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64			2
' i believe the style of play the manager 's got and the boys play and with the magnificent players in midfield slotting balls through , i can run on to the end of those balls and slot them away , ' said @entity0			1
on the move : @entity0 takes on @entity52 ( left ) during @entity13 training at @entity79 this week time to shine : @entity0 grew up as a young player at @entity5 but is excited to haveb now joined @entity2 the @entity13 forward , who has scored eight goals in his 26 international appearances , admitted to having mixed feelings as he prepared to quit the club where he had grown up			1

' i like to join in on that and get in behind defenders and try to get shots off at goal , ' he added			0
despite the excitement around @entity0 's signing , some observers have still questioned @entity120 's judgement in bringing in a player with potential rather than shelling out to beat @entity5 to the loan deal for @entity124			1
