there 's a word to describe moments such as this and i think it ’s probably … eek ! the waters of the @entity7 are rushing 138ft beneath me and a double decker bus on the road below resembles a scale model			1
the pedestrians milling about on the pavements look as if they have come to life from a @entity15 painting and there is nothing between them and my boots but a sheet of glass			1
it sounds like a scene from @entity24 ’s @entity23 – but it ’s the latest attraction at @entity25			2
and yesterday i joined hundreds of pioneers to look down on @entity27 through a glass walkway on the upper part of the bridge			1
scary ? only if you ’re truly terrified of heights			0
but the unexpected shock of suddenly seeing what appears to be only fresh air between you and certain death did give a few the collywobbles			0
especially when a chirpy @entity25 guide jumped vigorously up and down on the glass alongside us to demonstrate ( what we hoped was ) its resilience			2
one half of the £ 1million walkway opened to the public yesterday between the north and south towers of the bridge and will be joined on december 1 by a parallel walk alongside it			1
they have been designed to give tourists , sightseers and thrill - seekers a unique view from a bridge that bills itself as the most famous in the world , not forgetting a peek at the workings of a legendary feat of engineering when the bridge below opens			1
for the faint of heart or weak of knee , it may be reassuring to learn that each glass panel along the 36ft walkway is getting on for three inches thick and weighs nearly 1,200lb			1
@entity82 executives insist the idea is to enthral rather that scare people – but this might not have been clear to some of those taking their first steps into the unknown yesterday			1
@entity89 : the glass walkway gives visitors a never - before - seen look at @entity27 life from one of the world ’s most famous bridges long way down : the glass floor panels weigh over 1,000 pounds each and required a 20 - strong team to install up high : the glass platform stretches across @entity82 's high - level walkways – nearly 140ft above the @entity7 nerves of steel : @entity82 attracts 600,000 visitors a year and the glass walkway is expected to boost those numbers never - before - seen views : a boat passes under @entity25 's new glass floor after it was unveiled on monday ‘ everything in your brain is saying “ do n’t , do n’t , do n’t ” , ’ said @entity109 , a 71 - year - old retired fireman from @entity110 , @entity111			1
‘ i trained on 100ft turntable ladders but at least you ’ve got something you can see beneath your feet			0
here , your eyes tell you you ’re walking on thin air			0
’ @entity120 , 36 , from @entity121 , used the experience to confront her fear of heights			0
she walked the entire length of glass , speeded up only towards the end – and yes , she did look down			2
‘ it was pretty frightening but i do n’t like to let it beat me , ’ she said			0
‘ i ca n’t take too much of it			0
’ not so for @entity131 , nine , and sister @entity132 , six , visiting @entity25 with their mother @entity133			0
they twirled , jumped , danced and slid fearlessly on the glass for more than 20 minutes , lying down at one stage to wave to the people below			2
ah yes , the people below			2
would they be able to use their vantage point for an up - skirt snapshot of unsuspecting women above ? it is something the bridge ’s architect sir @entity144 and civil engineer sir @entity146 did not have to consider 120 years ago – but the walkway designers admitted that they did			1
a guide tells me : ‘ at night it will be illuminated with so - called “ modesty lighting ”			0
in the day , the reflection , distance and angle mean the view upwards from beneath is nothing like as clear as the view downwards from above			0
we do n’t expect to see crowds gathering on the pavements			0
’ are you brave enough ? while testing visitors ’ nerves the glass floor offers a spectacular view of the bridge lifts new attraction : the glass walkway is the most significant change to the @entity82 since it opened in 1982 buzz of activity : the west walkway floor opened on monday and the east walkway opening is set for december 1 spectacular : from high above visitors have a spectacular vantage point as bascules are raised beneath their feet floating : the view from the roadside looking up to the new glass floor 138ft above the @entity7 feeling squeamish ? journalists capture the view from the newly - installed glass floor at the @entity82 hello down there : visitors can watch buses and pedestrians cross the historic bridge as boats sail under it @entity27 icon : @entity25 stretches across the @entity7 and is a favourite attraction for tourists to the city			1

@entity27 's newest tourist attraction provides a bird 's eye view from one of the world 's most famous bridges

it is the most significant change to the @entity82 since it opened in 1982
the west walkway floor opened on monday and the east walkway opening is set for december 1
