former @entity1 adviser @entity0 as some harsh wards for fellow @entity4 @entity3 , who announced this week she will not seek another term in @entity6 : good riddance			1
@entity0 said @entity8 , who represented @entity10 's 6th @entity9 since 2007 , ' did nothing ' as chairwoman of the @entity13			2
' it will be an opening for the @entity13 , ' @entity0 said sunday on the @entity16 , @entity17			0
' now the position is open , someone next year will accept the chairmanship of it , and they may do something with it			0
she insisted that campaign finance probes and her barely - there victory margin in 2012 were not factors in her decision to forgo a re-election bid in 2014 @entity0 's harsh words come a few days after @entity3 announced she would not seek another term in an eight - and - a - half minute video message posted on @entity46			1
' the law limits anyone from serving as president of the @entity50 for more than eight years , ' @entity3 said in her videotaped message			2
' and in my opinion - well , eight years is also long enough for an individual to serve as a representative for a specific @entity6 district			0
' @entity3 has been dogged by allegations that she improperly spent money from a @entity6 - related political action committee to help with her 2012 campaign for the @entity4 presidential nomination			1
former campaign aides first leveled that accusation , and both the @entity64 and the @entity65 are investigating			0
the @entity66 has also made inquiries into charges that @entity3 's presidential campaign made secret payments to @entity72 @entity4 state senator @entity71 for help in the run - up to the 2012 @entity75			1
former @entity3 chief of staff @entity76 said in a sworn statement that the congresswoman ' knew and approved ' of unethical payments to @entity71			2
but @entity3 insisted in her @entity46 video that her presidential campaign did nothing wrong			1
@entity3 was a candidate for the @entity4 presidential nomination in 2012 , but faltered when news surfaced that chronic migraine headaches limited her ability to manage her day - to - day responsibilities			1
she bowed out in february 2012 and ran for re-election to @entity6 with just nine months to campaign ' it was clearly understood that compliance with all rules and regulations was an absolute necessity for my presidential campaign , ' she said , ' and i have no reason to believe that that was not the case			0
' @entity3 narrowly won re-election last year , beating @entity101 @entity100 by just 4,200 votes , a margin of 1.1 per cent			1
@entity100 recently announced that he would run again next year			0
@entity3 downplayed concerns that she might not be re-elected if she were to run again in 2014			0
' my decision was not in any way influenced by any concerns about my being re-elected to @entity6 , ' she said			0
' if i ran i would again defeat the individual who i defeated last year			0
' a @entity4 strategist told @entity110 early wednesday morning that the @entity111 would be hard pressed to put resources into a 2014 @entity3 campaign , and suggested that her pre-emptive withdrawal was at least in part related to fears that she could n't win again without resources from her party			1
@entity119 : @entity3 appeared on ' @entity120 ' in november 2011 , during the @entity4 presidential primary season			2
former campaign aides have since accused her of making unethical payments to an @entity72 state legislator for help with her failed @entity75 effort ' @entity3 has a less than 50 - 50 chance of winning again , and she knows it , ' that @entity4 strategist said			1
' she 's probably bowing out gracefully so the @entity129 has plenty of time to find another candidate			0
that way if she ever runs for office again - say , for governor of @entity10 - she wo n't have to worry about bridges she burned			1
' @entity3 did leave open that possibility in her video			2
' there is no future option or opportunity - be it directly in the political area or otherwise - that i wo nâ€™t be giving serious consideration if it can help save and protect our great nation for future generations , ' she said .			0

former @entity1 adviser had harsh words for @entity10 congresswoman
@entity3 is being investigated for *misusing* **congressional** campaign funds to aid her failed presidential bid
in @entity46 video , she insists her early withdrawal is n't related to her razor - thin margin of victory in last year 's **congressional** election
