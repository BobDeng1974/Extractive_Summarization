ambulances will be allowed to take longer to reach seriously ill patients under controversial plans announced by the health secretary			2
@entity4 yesterday unveiled a pilot scheme that will give operators an extra two minutes to assess 999 calls before dispatching paramedics			1
he said the added time will enable staff to establish if an ambulance is really needed , over concerns they are being sent out too readily to patients who are not seriously ill. but unions warned that the move would cost lives and dismissed the scheme as a ploy to meet targets ahead of the election			1
health secretary @entity4 ( pictured ) unveiled a pilot scheme yesterday that will give operators in the @entity25 and @entity26 services an extra two minutes to assess 999 calls before dispatching paramedics the ambulance service is under severe pressure and for the past nine months has persistently missed the target of responding to life - threatening calls within eight minutes			1
this week , operators at @entity33 and @entity35 ambulance trusts were accused of downgrading calls in a ploy to make response times look quicker			1
the government had previously denied reports it had been considering extending the waiting times for some serious calls from eight minutes to 19			2
mr @entity4 dismissed such reports as scaremongering but the new pilots will extend target times – albeit by a lesser amount			1
they will cover two of the ten ambulance services in @entity49 – @entity25 and the @entity26 , who together cover 13million patients – and begin next month			1
ambulances will be dispatched immediately only if it is a suspected cardiac arrest or major accident			1
for all other calls , including life - threatening cases such as strokes , breathing difficulties and blood clots , operators will get three minutes to assess patients			1
presently they get one only minute and figures suggest they are wrongly categorising tens of thousands of non-serious calls as ‘ life - threatening ’			1
it is hoped the two added minutes will help operators better judge the needs of patients			2
outlining the plans in a written statement to the @entity70 yesterday , mr @entity4 said there was ‘ significant evidence to suggest that giving call handlers extra assessment time to make the right decision for the patient could improve their chances of survival ’			1
mr @entity4 said the added time will help staff establish if an ambulance is really necessary			1
operators are currently given one minute to asses whether a situation is ' life - threatening ' ( file photo ) he added : ‘ giving call handlers very limited extra assessment time would ensure that ambulances are better deployed to where they are most needed and would allow a faster response time for those patients who really need it			1
’ shadow health secretary @entity94 backed the idea of a pilot scheme but said that , with paramedics and @entity100 units under such pressure , they are poorly timed			1
‘ this is the worst winter for years in @entity49 ’s a&es			0
it is not the time for experiments , ’ he said			2
‘ the government must urgently provide reassurance this can be done without putting patient safety at risk			0
’ @entity113 , of the union @entity112 , which represents ambulance staff , said : ‘ these pilots will only serve to bring worse outcomes for patients			2
‘ the run - up to the general election is clearly a factor so that the @entity121 can show that ambulance services are meeting their targets			2
this is so far from the truth			0
’ professor @entity125 , @entity49 ’s national director for acute care , said the new arrangements will increase the availability of ambulances			0
‘ by acting with slightly less haste on the calls , we believe we can get to more patients with more speed , ’ he said			0
the pilot schemes were announced amid further concern over the @entity49 in @entity137 , with new figures showing that more than 15,000 patients were left languishing on trolleys for 12 hours or more last year in @entity100 units			0
waiting times are the worst on record and even more abysmal than in @entity49			0
just 81 per cent of patients were treated within four hours , when the target is 95 per cent			0
queues of ambulances seen stacked up outside hospitals in @entity137 over the past few days suggest that the current crisis is even more severe			0
paramedic @entity150 ( pictured ) claims he has been banned from two hospitals after revealing @entity100 were ' not safe ' during a @entity153 interview a paramedic says he has been banned from two hospitals after blowing the whistle on unsafe conditions in @entity100 units			0
@entity150 of @entity158 claims he was told to stay away after a @entity160 interview in which he said staff were regularly carrying out medical procedures in the corridors of @entity164			0
but he says he has since been banned from the @entity165 in @entity164 and @entity166 in @entity167 because of the upset he had caused staff			0
@entity171 chief operating officer @entity170 allegedly emailed @entity158 saying mr @entity150 ‘ is no longer welcome on either of our hospital sites ’			0
it is unclear how the alleged ban will work in practice , as mr @entity150 is continuing his work as a paramedic			0
mr @entity170 says he supports whistleblowing and that his emails concerned the ‘ personal upset ’ mr @entity150 had caused @entity100 staff .			2
