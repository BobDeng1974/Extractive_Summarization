by @entity0 a teenage girl who glued on false nails lost the top of her finger after it rotted away			1
@entity5 , 17 , applied her own false nails at home with cosmetic @entity9 glue bought in boots - but days later she was rushed to hospital with a serious infection			1
bar worker @entity13 was in agony as the index finger on her right hand turned green and started dying			1
@entity5 , 17 , had to have the tip of her finger amputated after it became severely infected			1
the index finger became infected after she used some nail glue that she bought from boots doctors had to cut off the top of the finger to save her hand - and cut the finger open from tip to palm to clean it out			1
miss @entity5 bought the Â £ 3.20 @entity26 at a @entity20 store in @entity28 , @entity29			2
she said : ' i bought the glue for a set of nails i had at home already			0
all i wanted was for my nails to look nice			0
' but later the next day my finger was really hurting , so i took the nails off			2
' my nail had turned a greeny - black colour underneath			0
' i went to @entity40 and they gave me antibiotics			0
but when they did n't work i was rushed in for surgery			0
miss @entity5 went to hospital with a severe infection in her nail ( left )			1
she had to have surgery to remove the tip of her finger ( right ) and save the rest of it			1
she also had to have the whole finger opened up and cleaned miss @entity5 was also given iv antibiotics to combat the infection ' it was very frightening - i was crying in pain , it was so scary			1
' miss @entity5 had an hour - long operation and was kept in hospital for observation			1
she said : ' the pain was still so bad and i was put on a drip for antibiotics			0
' doctors did n't know then if they 'd saved my finger			2
they said it might still have to be amputated			0
' while she was in recovery , miss @entity5 contracted the serious bacterial infection mrsa and had to spend a further two nights in an isolated cubicle at @entity70 in @entity71			1
the teenager , of @entity28 , is now having physiotherapy sessions to help with getting the use of her finger back			0
while miss @entity5 was in hospital after the operation she also developed @entity67 she said : ' i can not understand how my finger became so infected			1
it may have been a bad batch of glue and we are thinking about taking legal action			0
' her mother , @entity83 , 40 , said : ' it was difficult to see @entity5 in such pain			2
' it was such a relief that she did n't lose her whole finger			0
' for a long time her right hand was very touch sensitive and caused lots of pain , even just placing her finger flat down was terribly sore			2
' now the teen has vowed that she will never wear false nails again			1
a spokesman for boots said : ' it is a matter for the manufacturer			0
we do n't feel able to comment at this time as the customer may pursue a legal case			0
' @entity5 ( pictured in hospital ) said : ' doctors did n't know then if they 'd saved my finger			1
they said it might still have to be amputated ' however , a skin and beauty therapist told @entity108 that it is most likely that the infection was not caused by the glue , but that it was caused by poor nail preparation before the glue was applied			1
@entity113 , who owns @entity114 and your skin , said : ' it 's likely to be to do with the application process and the care of the nail			2
' i always get very worried about these at home treatments			0
it 's really unfortunate , and i have massive sympathy for that , but it is probably down to her ability in applying it			0
' if there is water under the nail that could give rise to an infection			2
as with many things , its usually consumer error and not being equipped with the right knowledge			0
' if the glue has n't bonded properly , or the nail is wet or dirty before the glue is applied , it allows infection to breed			1
' she added that people should always ensure their nails are clean and free of dirt and oil before false nails are applied			1
@entity5 ( pictured with her mother , @entity83 ) is considering taking legal action against the glue 's manufacturer			2
image shows how her finger looks now that it has recovered from the amputation			0

@entity5 , 17 , applied false nails and developed a finger infection
she was rushed to hospital in agony when it started to die and turn green
doctors had to cut the top off her finger to save the rest of the digit
they also had to cut the whole finger open to clean it out and save it
but a skin *expert* says the infection was probably caused by the false nail being applied to a wet or dirty nail
