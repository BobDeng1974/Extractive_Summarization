by @entity0 not since the great @entity1 was in his heyday has a @entity3 descended on @entity4 with quite as much going for him as the remarkable @entity5 at the @entity6 this week			1
who would dare argue now that 50 is not the new 30 after a month in which @entity5 appears to have lived out the ultimate middle - aged male fantasy ? let ’s see : played at @entity11 and finished in the top four at the masters ; met up with his old mates on the @entity16 and won his first event ; came back home and got married to a woman half his age ; played in his home @entity23 and became the first golfer over the age of 50 to win on the @entity26			1
how ’s that for a bucket list rattled off in the space of just 35 days ? 50 years young : @entity5 is in prodigious form coming into this week 's @entity6 27th time lucky : @entity5 was a popular winner of the @entity23 at @entity32 as @entity33 said to him on the eve of the final round at @entity11 : ‘ you know how much i admired @entity1 , how much i learned from him , how he was my hero			1
today my hero is you			0
’ it ’s not just @entity33			0
there ’s not a golfer at the @entity26 ’s flagship event who could n’t learn from him			0
the gym rats could learn you can be the fittest golfer in the world but it ’s not much use if you ’re not fit for golf			0
the strung - out obsessives could learn the value of a relaxing glass of wine and the importance of remembering that playing the game for a living remains an enormous privilege			2
those who only play well on certain courses could learn from the man who always begins every event with the odds stacked heavily against him but does n’t know the meaning of the word ‘ ca n’t ’			0
defying convention : the @entity65 veteran takes his fun attitude towards life onto the course , and it works and those who place too much importance on appearance money , well they could learn about loyalty from the man who kept his own @entity26 event alive with his own money as the @entity65 economy hurtled towards oblivion ; a player who ’d cut off his ponytail before he ’d turn his back on the @entity80 in @entity81 because of how well they ’ve treated him over the years ; who ’s given up millions in senior golf earnings to pursue his dream of becoming the oldest @entity86 to compete in the @entity87			1
sunday ’s fabulous feel - good victory at the @entity23 - he won it for the first time at the 27th attempt - showed just why he is right to believe			1
he might be one spot outside the automatic placings but right now he is the only player with two victories to his name in full - field events during the qualifying process			0
and the @entity87 is all about winners			2
love of his life : @entity5 with @entity100 , who he married this month , ahead of the 2012 @entity87 married his birdie : @entity5 tied the knot with @entity103 in @entity104 this month how does he do it , with his funky swing , portly physique and the fact he gets outdriven by 40 yards on most holes ? it has become perhaps the most oft - asked question in golf			1
no - one ever supplied a better answer than former @entity23 champion @entity114			1
‘ he plays the game the way we all want to play			1
he has fun , ’ said the former @entity116 @entity87 captain			1
‘ that ’s the key to a long career			0
a big part of why @entity5 is still so good is he carries over his philosophy of living to his game			2
’ and so it is that the middle - aged males , that most ubiquitous of golfing species in @entity130 , will arrive at @entity4 in their thousands this week with a little extra jaunt to their stride			1
they thought it was something when their hero won the @entity6 at the age of 44			2
they marvelled when he came back from breaking his leg in a skiing accident to finish fourth last year at 49			0
now here he is again , still the man making everything seem possible			0
once it was @entity1 who captured their imagination for being the man they all wished they could be			0
now it is @entity5 , the man they all wished they had become			0
fire in the belly : @entity5 shows frustration at a tee shot at @entity11 this year , where he finished fourth among the willing youngsters carrying mobile scoreboards with each group at the @entity6 this week is @entity158 , who has a big event of her own looming on the horizon			1
at just 17 , the @entity4 teenager has been selected to represent @entity130 and @entity163 in the @entity164 in @entity165 next month , thus becoming one of its youngest ever participants			2
‘ watching the top men close up , i ’m hoping to pick up some playing and tactical hints , ’ says @entity158			0
quote of the week ‘ we ca n’t wait to play at @entity4 and get the @entity6 crowd rocking			1
we ’re all big golf fans , so it ’s a gig we ’re all looking forward to			0
’ who could have imagined a member of @entity177 saying that ? did rock get old or golf become young ? anyway , @entity181 , who took over on drums when @entity183 died , will lead his own band featuring former members of @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188 - if you ’re under 30 , ask your parents - in a free concert for @entity6 ticketholders on saturday .			2

@entity5 takes form into the @entity6 at @entity4 this week
he finished top four at @entity11 , won on the @entity16 and won the @entity23 after a play - off
the @entity3 , 50 , could teach his fitness fanatic *opponents* a thing or two
@entity5 is known for valuing loyalty over *lucrative* appearance fees
he 's given up millions in senior winnings to pursue his @entity87 dream
if selected , @entity5 will be the oldest @entity86 to play @entity87
@entity114 says he ' plays the game the way we all want to *...* he has fun '
