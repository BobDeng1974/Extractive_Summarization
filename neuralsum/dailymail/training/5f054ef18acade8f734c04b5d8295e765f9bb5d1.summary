prosecutors have used phone records to show that four other gang members were in the area at the time of the crime in @entity15			1
but they say they are missing a month of @entity0 's records from two phones because his service provider at the time , @entity19 , no longer has them			1
@entity0 's attorney @entity21 has filed court paper saying that the @entity23 is required to turn over the phone records if they exist because they could be crucial to his client 's defense			1
he says it is likely that the @entity1 collected data on @entity0 's calls and that the defense is entitled to access the records because they may show @entity0 was n't involved in a previous july robbery attempt			1
' the government must be ordered to turn over the records for the two telephones that it attributes to mr. @entity0 for the dates which are relevant to this case , ' @entity21 said in the motion			1
