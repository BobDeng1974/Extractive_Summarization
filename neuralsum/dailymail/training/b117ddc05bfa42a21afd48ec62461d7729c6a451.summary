three rocky outcrops , the size of kitchen tables , could be worth billions of dollars to the @entity4 government			1
the three rocks , which are barely one metre above sea level and three metres long , were discovered by @entity7 during a satellite sweep of the area			0
since they are naturally forming and sit ' above ordinary high water ' , they have been classified as ' islands ' , prompting a redrawing of @entity4 's maritime boundaries			1
three rocky outcrops , barely a metre high , have been found off the coast of @entity4			1
since the outcrops are technically islands , they prompt a redrawing of @entity4 's maritime boundaries the tiny outcrops sit directly above the @entity24 gas field , which makes up more than half of the multibillion dollar @entity27 offshore petroleum project and mean the state government 's share of @entity24 may increase from 5 percent to up to 65.5 percent			1
the outcrops are part of the @entity33 , 300km north - west of @entity34 on the north coast of @entity4			1
@entity7 shared news of the discovery with other agencies last week after they realised the huge ramifications of the discovery , reported the @entity4			2
a spokesman for @entity4 mining minister @entity42 said the state government were notified of the find on wednesday			1
' it will means billions of dollars for the state , ' he said			0
the redrawing of the boundaries has not yet been ratified , but @entity4 mining minister @entity42 said the discovery was ' very exciting and potentially a great windfall for the state			1
' a satellite image of the @entity33 where the rocky outcrops were found			0
the reef sits above the @entity24 gas field , which makes up half of the @entity59 project , one of the largest gas and oil projects in @entity4 @entity42 , @entity4 's mining minister , said the find meant a ' huge windfall ' for the state ' we 're now working closely with the @entity68 to determine @entity4 's share of the @entity59 field and it 's exact implications			1
' @entity4 will work cooperatively with the @entity73 and the @entity75 partners to the bring the project into production , ' said mr @entity42			2
the proposed boundary changes could affect up to seven of the 13 gas fields in the area			0
the @entity59 project is one of the country 's largest oil and gas developments			2
mr @entity42 told the @entity86 that this discovery will probably not have any effect on whether the gas will be processed onshore at @entity89			0
@entity4 premier @entity90 has advocated for gas to be processed onshore at @entity89 north of @entity91 , sparking widespread protests on the grounds that the site is culturally and environmentally significant			2
@entity95 refused that option , saying it was not financially viable and it prefers floating liquefied gas technology			0
mr @entity42 told the @entity86 : ' the premier has actually said that for this particular project floating lng is probably already organised			0
' @entity89 was the proposed location of the on - shore gas processing plant , though the gas will now be processed off - shore on floating platforms the @entity59 project is one of the country 's largest oil and gas developments , all the gas will be processed on a floating lng platform like this prototype			0

three tiny rocks off the coast of @entity4 have been *deemed* ' islands '
@entity4 's maritime boundaries will be redrawn to *include* the rocks , which sit directly on top of the @entity24 gas field
the gas field makes up 50 percent of a *multi-billion* dollar mining deal
the state 's share in the deal may have increased from 5 to up to 65 percent
