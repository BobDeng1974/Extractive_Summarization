mr @entity8 told @entity42 how he was held down on the sofa while his terrified wife was taken away to the hospital			1
he then spent a desperate five hours trying to find out where @entity7 had been taken as officials refused to tell him			1
when he eventually found his wife at the @entity50 's @entity49 in @entity51 , he arrived just minutes after the injection had been administered			0

known to many as the one - child policy , @entity3 's actual rules are more complicated			2
the government limits most urban couples to one child , and allows two children for rural families if their firstborn is a girl			0
numerous other exceptions include looser rules for minority families and a two - child limit for parents who are themselves both singletons			2
there has been growing speculation among @entity3 media , experts and ordinary people about whether the government will soon relax the one - child policy — introduced in 1980 as a temporary measure to curb surging population growth — and allow more people to have two children			2
though the government credits the policy with preventing hundreds of millions of births and helping lift countless families out of poverty , it is reviled by many ordinary people			0
the strict limits have led to forced abortions and sterilizations , even though such measures are illegal			2
couples who flout the rules face hefty fines , seizure of their property and loss of their jobs			0
many today also see the birth limits as outdated , a relic of the era when housing , jobs and food were provided by the state			0
she told @entity42 that after her son was born she had a contraceptive coil inserted , a procedure proscribed by @entity3			2
she said it must have failed and she discovered she was expecting a second child when she was four months into the pregnancy			0
the couple decided against informing the authorities as they feared a forced abortion and instead hoped to pay a fine after the birth - this is sometimes acceptable in parts of @entity3			1
it is not clear how authorities found out @entity7 was pregnant			1
the @entity181 in @entity182 told @entity42 they were looking into the case			0
in july a man stabbed to death two government workers in @entity3 after they told him they could n't register his fourth child			0
they had told the man they were unable to record the birth because he had not paid a fine for breaching @entity3 's family planning laws			0
the official @entity193 , said staff at the @entity195 - which comes under @entity196 - had refused to register the man 's fourth child for a hukou , or resident 's certificate , because he had n't paid a social compensation fee			2
the fine is levied on parents who break family planning laws and can be up to 10 times a family 's annual income			0
a child without a hukou faces problems registering for education , health care and government benefits			0

many demographers argue that the policy has worsened the country 's aging crisis by limiting the size of the young labor pool that must support the large baby boom generation as it retires			0
they say it has contributed to the imbalanced sex ratio by encouraging families to abort baby girls , preferring to try for a male heir .			0
