by @entity0 @entity1 has backed plans for a one way trip to @entity4 , claiming the first visitors should remain on the red planet until they die			1
during a @entity7 he told users the first visitors should build up a permanent settlement on @entity4			1
he also admitted he struggles to deal with people who say the moon landings were fake - and admitted he loved his time on the lunar surface			1
@entity1 , the lunar module pilot , walking on the surface of the @entity16 near the leg of the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) " @entity18 " during the @entity20 extravehicular activity ( @entity21 )			0
he said that missions to @entity4 should be one way , and lead to a permanent colony being set up			1
' my first words of my impression of being on the surface of the @entity16 that just came to my mind was ' magnificent desolation			0
' the magnificence of human beings , humanity , @entity35 , maturing the technologies , imagination and courage to expand our capabilities beyond the next ocean , to dream about being on the @entity16 , and then taking advantage of increases in technology and carrying out that dream - achieving that is magnificent testimony to humanity			1
but it is also desolate - there is no place on earth as desolate as what i was viewing in those first moments on the @entity55			2
because i realized what i was looking at , towards the horizon and in every direction , had not changed in hundreds , thousands of years			0
beyond me i could see the moon curving away - no atmosphere , black sky			1
colder than anyone could experience on @entity35 when the sun is up - but when the sun is up for 14 days , it gets very , very hot			2
no sign of life whatsoever			0
more desolate than any place on @entity35			0
' there is very little doubt , in my mind , that what the next monumental achievement of humanity will be the first landing by an @entity80 , a human being , on the planet @entity4 , ' he said			1
' and i expect that within 2 decades of the 5th anniversary of the first landing on the moon , that within 2 decades @entity83 will lead an international presence on @entity4			1
' i have considered whether a landing on @entity4 could be done by the private sector , ' he said during the discussion to promote the 45th anniversary of the @entity20 moon landing , which is on 20 july			1
' it conflicts with my very strong idea , concept , conviction , that the first human beings to land on @entity4 should not come back to @entity35			1
' they should be the beginning of a build - up of a colony / settlement , i call it a ' permanence '			1
he also hit back at claims it would be a suicide mission			0
' a settlement you can visit once or twice , come back , and then decide you want to settle			2
' same with a colony			0
' but you want it to be permanent from the get - go , from the very first			1
i know that many people do n't feel that that should be done			2
' some people even consider it distinctly a suicide mission			2
not me ! not at all			0
' because we will plan , we will construct from the moon of @entity4 , over a period of six to seven years , the landing of different objects at the landing site that will be brought together to form a complete @entity4 habitat and laboratory , similar to what has been done at the moon			1
' he also hit out at firms offering what he claims amount to tourist trips			0
' tourism trips to @entity4 and back are just not the appropriate way for human beings from @entity35 – to have an individual company , no matter how smart , send people to mars and bring them back , it is very very expensive			1
it delays the obtaining of permanence , internationally			0
' @entity1 also admitted he did n't waste time listening to people who said the moon landings were faked @entity1 was also asked about conspiracy theorists who say the moon landings were faked			1
' i personally do n't waste very much of my time on what is so obvious to a really thinking person , of all the evidence – we talked about @entity152 recently , who made a very prophetic observation			2
' he said that ' extraordinary observations require extraordinary evidence to make them believable			0
' there is not extraordinary evidence of ( as far as i know ) all the claims that have been made that we did not go to the moon			2
' he also said he believed alien life exists			0
' there may be aliens in our @entity165 galaxy , and there are billions of other galaxies			0
' the probability is almost certain that there is life somewhere in space			0
' it was not that remarkable , that special , that unusual , that life here on earth evolved gradually , slowly , to where we are today			0
' he also hit out at calls for @entity180 to return to the moon ' returning to the @entity16 with @entity180 astronauts is not the best usage of our resources			2
because our resources should be directed to outward , beyond - the - moon , to establishing habitation and laboratories on the surface of @entity4 that can be built , assembled , from the close - by moons of @entity4			1
' with very little time delay - a second or less			1
' much better than controlling things on the @entity16 from the @entity35			0
so when @entity180 funding comes up for review , please call your lawmakers to support it			0
' gravity ( 2013 ) , starring @entity197 as @entity198			1
' i thought that the movie @entity196 , the depiction of people moving around in zero gravity , was really the best i have seen			1
' the free - falling , the actions that took place between two people , were very , i think , exaggerated , but probably bent the laws of physics			1
' but to a person who 's been in space , we would cringe looking at something that we hoped would never , ever happen			0
' it 's very thrilling for the person who 's never been there , because it portrays the hazards , the dangers that could come about if things begin to go wrong , and i think that as i came out of that movie , i said to myself and others , ' @entity197 deserves an @entity222			1
' @entity1 was also asked how the decision was made on who would walk on the moon first			2
' i felt that there was an obligation on my part to put forth the reasons why a commander who had been burdened down with an enormous amount of responsibility and training for activities ( and because of that , in all previous missions , if someone , a crew member , was to spacewalk , it was always the junior person , not the space commander who would stay inside )			0
we knew this would be different because 2 people would be going out			2
@entity1 , the second man to land on the moon , celebrated communion on the heavenly orb ' there was a group at @entity180 who felt the junior person ( me ) should go out first , but many people felt the great symbology of the commander from past expeditions or arrivals at a destination			1
' the decision that was made was absolutely correct as far as who went out first , symbolically			0
however who was in charge of the what happened after both people are outside , i believe , could have been done differently			2
' i was not the commander , i was a junior person , so once both were outside , i followed my leader , because we ( @entity180 ) had not put together detailed jobs of people outside			2
' i believe it could have been improved			0
but it was very successful for what it was			0
' and the decision was n't up to me , or @entity275 , it was up to people much higher up in @entity180			0

told @entity279 first visitors should build up a permanent settlement on @entity4
admitted he struggles to deal with people who say the moon landings were fake - and admits his time on the moon could have been better organised
says he thought @entity197 deserved an @entity222 for gravity
