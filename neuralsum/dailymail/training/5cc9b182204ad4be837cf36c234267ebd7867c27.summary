healthy diet : but four year - old @entity1 has been labelled ' obese ' he loves riding his bike , plays football every day and always eats his vegetables			1
so four - year - old @entity1 ’s mother was stunned when she received a letter from the @entity7 saying he was ‘ clinically obese ’			1
the letter warned that the little boy was so ‘ overweight ’ he was at risk of heart disease , cancer and diabetes			1
at 2st 12lb , @entity1 is three pounds outside the recommended weight range for his age , which is between 2st 1lb and 2st 9lb			1
@entity1 ’s mother @entity17 , 29 , said she was ‘ furious ’ he had been labelled obese , explaining : ‘ it ’s ridiculous – there ’s nothing of him			1
‘ he is the smallest in his class and if anything he ’s quite skinny for his age			2
he still wears clothing labelled for a three - year - old even though he is nearly five			2
‘ he runs around constantly , loves riding his bike and playing football , and always eats a healthy diet			2
there ’s not an ounce of extra fat anywhere on his body			0
’ hundreds of children have been sent letters informing them they are overweight or obese since the controversial child - measurement programme started			2
eating disorder charities have described the letters as a ‘ scare tactic ’ that could have damaging effects on youngsters vulnerable to eating disorders			0
miss @entity17 , of @entity41 , @entity42 , said she and her partner @entity43 , 33 , a fire technician , had not been informed that @entity1 was going to be weighed at school earlier this month			1
two weeks later they received a letter in the post stating that he was ‘ very overweight ’ for his age , adding : ‘ doctors call this clinically obese			0
’ it went on to list a string of risks associated with obesity , including cancer and heart disease			1
the stay - at - home mother , who also has two daughters @entity58 , 11 , and @entity59 , ten , said labelling children obese while they were still growing was ‘ dangerous ’ and could lead to them developing eating disorders			2
‘ @entity62 have enough pressure to be the right size from magazines and tv , ’ miss @entity17 said			0
‘ they do n’t need it at school as well			0
‘ after she was weighed , my eldest daughter came home saying , “ @entity72 , i ’m the thinnest in my class ”			0
she is 11 years old			0
‘ i do n’t want my kids coming home talking about how much they weigh , or thinking it ’s some kind of competition			0
this is just a complete waste of @entity7 money and should be stopped			1
’ miss @entity17 wrote to her local @entity7 trust to complain			1
but the @entity42 child - measurement team said that , although weighing children was a ‘ sensitive issue ’ , it was important to identify children who were at risk of ‘ growing into overweight or obese adults ’			2
@entity90 , of the @entity91 , said : ‘ i fully understand what a sensitive issue this is for children and their families			0
warning : the @entity7 letter sent to @entity1 's mother earlier this month shock : @entity1 's mother @entity100 said her son runs around constantly and loves riding his bike and playing football ‘ over a third of children in years four and six are either overweight or obese nationally , and this is also true for @entity42			1
‘ children are not growing out of their “ puppy fat ” like they used to a few decades ago and it is more likely that they will grow into overweight or obese adults if they are shown to be that at this age			0
’ she added that after speaking to @entity119 she ‘ agreed that these measurements did not necessarily indicate a problem or a concern on this occasion ’ .			0
