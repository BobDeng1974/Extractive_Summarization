we ’ve just had the draw for the @entity2 this summer and it ’s exciting to think that the tournament will be staged on home soil in @entity6			1
we ’ve won the tournament the last two times – in 2011 and 2013 – so it would be a really special achievement to win a hat - trick on our own patch			1
traditionally the hosts get to pick which group they go into , and we are now in @entity15 with @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
the way it ’s worked means we have a slightly harder group but it could potentially be easier in the next stage			1
in @entity26 it ’s @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 , so it must have been a tough decision for the coaches			1
@entity36 set to represent @entity37 in this summer 's @entity38 team gb have won the last two tournaments in 2011 and 2013 , and 2015 is being hosted in @entity6 our group will be tough , though			1
@entity20 are a good side and probably the team to watch out for , but with them you can catch them in different form throughout the tournament			1
they often start strong but then tend to drop off a little bit towards the end			1
we might be able to play them before the tournament to gauge how they are			1
@entity19 are another enigma – they came second in the @entity57 in 2010 and then bottom of the @entity59 the next year and went down a division			1
but they ’ve worked their way back up and could be tricky			1
@entity17 are like @entity20 and can be the best team in the world or implode , but we always seem to play well against them so i think we ’ll be ok			1
as for @entity16 , they have got weaker over the past few years and the @entity18 , i wo n’t lie , i ’ve never seen them play ! that ’ s because they ’ve not been in the top division for a while but we ’ll have to be wary of them			2
i think we ’ll definitely qualify for the knockouts as four from each group go through , but all it takes is for the other teams to show up and it could be tough			2
but wheelchair basketball is always difficult to predict			2
you never know what the others are going to do			2
having missed out on @entity84 , this is my first senior major on home soil , so i ’m very excited by it			2
i ’m playing in the league in @entity17 right now so it has n’t really sunk in yet			2
but come april or may i ’ll suddenly think : ‘ ooh , this is going to be good			2
’ in terms of support , my mum has hired a little studio apartment for the duration and a few others will come down so hopefully there ’ll be plenty of noise from my end			0
but as far as i ’m aware , she has this one - bed place but eight or 10 of them want to stay down there			1
it will be a tight squeeze			0
@entity36 currently play for a club in @entity104 , @entity17 called @entity105 @entity36 ( far left ) is one of seven athletes @entity107 are following on the @entity108 i ’m still only 20 but it ’s nice to be a more experience member of the @entity112 squad now			1
i was at the @entity113 last year and a few of those players are now in the seniors and because they know me they feel they can come to me and ask questions			0
so that ’s good for some new youngsters to be coming through and for us all to know each other and get on well			0
we have a @entity112 training camp coming up in the next few weeks and that will be a good chance for us all to meet up			0
we ’re off to @entity32 , somewhere near @entity125 , and we ’re lucky that @entity127 funding helps us with those kind of camps			0
they ’re always so vital for us to train and practise together			0
for me personally i ’m enjoying my second season playing for @entity105 in the @entity17 league			0
we ’re based in @entity104 , which is quite a remote city			0
there ’s hardly any tourism or anything like that , but it makes it easier to focus on wheelchair basketball			0
as for my @entity17 , it ’s getting there			0
i ’m quite good at understanding it now but speaking is n't so good			0
we have a translator on our team who comes to games as well just in case … sometimes when it comes down to it you tend to forget your tenses and things like that			0
there ’s five other brits in my team so it ’s nice to hang out together			0
we have our own places but three of us are all within about 100 yards of each other so that ’s perfect			0
as well as funding the @entity163 athletes , every week @entity127 players raise over £ 33 million for arts , heritage , charity , community projects and grass roots sports clubs and facilities			1
