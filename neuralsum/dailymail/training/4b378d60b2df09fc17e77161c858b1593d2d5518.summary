from creating smart devices that can be operated with a phone , to retro games consoles - programmers and gadget enthusiasts can now get an even smaller slice of the @entity6 microcomputer			1
the @entity8 engineering foundation has unveiled its latest version , called the @entity10 - a super-slim , 2.5 inch - long ( 6.5cm ) machine costing just £ 15.50 in the @entity8 , and $ 20 in the @entity13			1
it ’s described as a ‘ small , energy - efficient and crazy - affordable ’ way to get into computing , or to hack products and create new engineering projects for coders with more experience			2
it weighs 0.8 ounces ( 23g ) and has been designed for watching hi - definition video , programming , playing games and web browsing			1
this is because the tiny @entity38 computer has a @entity40 socket to connect to a monitor or tv			0
dimensions : 2.1 - inch x 2.2 - inch x 0.4 - inches ( 6.5cm x 5.6cm x 1.2cm ) at its thickest point			1
memory : @entity47 expansion : microsd slot , usb port , 40 pins weight : 8 ounces ( 23g ) @entity53 : £ 15.50 ( @entity8 ) and $ 20 ( @entity13 ) comparison with old @entity55 : model a + is 20 per cent cheaper , 24 per cent shorter and 42 per cent thinner there is also an audio jack , room for a micro sd card and a usb socket to connect other devices			1
the model a + is made by @entity6 , a @entity65 - based charity , which launched its original cheap microcomputer in 2012			1
the microcomputer became a surprise hit and is now used in many schools in the @entity8 to teach coding			2
the model a + model is its cheapest and smallest yet			2
@entity72 , director of hardware engineering , said : ‘ we want to get them into the hands of children so they can learn about computers and programming			0
‘ parents might not want to let children play about on computers , but this gives them access to technology at an affordable price			0
the @entity38 microcomputer ( shown ) is described as ‘ small , energy - efficient and crazy - affordable ’ way to get into computing or to hack products and create new engineering projects , for coders with more experience ‘ it is cheap and flexible			2
it can be used as a desktop pc or for a robot			0
it is a bit like digital @entity97			0
’ @entity6 recently revamped its more powerful model b board to a b + with extra features , for the same $ 35 ( £ 24 ) price tag			1
the engineers said the new @entity55 + ‘ inherits many improvements that we made to the @entity103 + ’			0
the small microcomputer is $ 5 ( £ 3.15 ) cheaper than the @entity55 , which the foundation describes as ‘ pretty mind - bending ’			1
in an interview with @entity109 , founder @entity107 revealed that @entity111 ’s @entity110 is responsible for the firm pushing for cheaper prices , because he said : ‘ try and be as cheap as possible ... try and get as close to free as you can			1
’ @entity111 gave the foundation $ 1 million ( £ 630,000 ) last year to put 15,000 @entity115 in @entity8 schools in a bid to help children learn to code			1
the world 's first @entity120 printed laptop , called @entity123 ( pictured ) powered by a @entity6 , has raised more than one - and - a - half times its funding target on @entity125 the world 's first @entity120 printed laptop , powered by a @entity6 , has raised more than one - and - a - half times its funding target on @entity125			2
the @entity123 was designed to teach people how to build 3d printed circuits and hardware			0
its case can be printed on a 3d printer , or the £ 180 kit includes a moulded case			0
it also features a @entity6 board , and instructions on how to create the @entity138 laptop			0
the campaign page said the ' learning experience will take you to a stage where you are designing your own components and products			0
' it ends on 13 november and has raised more than $ 129,970 ( £ 81,900 ) of its $ 80,000 ( £ 50,400 ) target .			0

the @entity10 is 2.5 - inches ( 6.5cm ) long - the smallest yet
it features an audio jack , a microsd card slot and usb socket
extras should enable coders to use the small device in new ways
it 's designed for watching video , playing games and web browsing
@entity111 's @entity110 *inspired* the @entity65 - based foundation to cut the price of the model a + by $ 5 ( £ 3 ) compared to the previous model
the next - *generation* model costs £ 15.50 in the @entity8 and $ 20 in the @entity13
