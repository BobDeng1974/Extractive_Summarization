this is the week the dynamic of @entity2 ’s season changes			1
and just when things are moving in the right direction for @entity5			2
two defeats in 22 games have seen the @entity9 side move to within four points of the @entity12 places and secure an @entity14 quarter - final slot after saturday ’s win at @entity16			1
but how will the @entity17 deal with the @entity18 restarting this week ? @entity19 ( centre ) volleys in @entity2 's equaliser in the 49th minute at @entity16 @entity19 ( left ) and @entity22 ( right ) celebrate after the @entity2 striker hit the equaliser @entity2 manager @entity5 has warned his players about the @entity18 curse it ’s that thursday - sunday conundrum to which nobody seems to have the answer			1
@entity2 welcome @entity30 this thursday before travelling to fellow @entity31 top - four contenders @entity32 on sunday			1
four days later they face the return leg in @entity34 , before welcoming champions @entity35 on sunday			1
so , is the @entity18 a hindrance for @entity5 ? ‘ we want to play as many games as we can , ’ said the @entity2 manager			1
‘ it will be tough but when you ’re winning games it gives you energy			2
we had tough games this week but the players have been brilliant and came through it well			2
@entity46 ( centre ) celebrates after his 58th minute goal put @entity2 2 - 1 up against @entity49 in the @entity14 feb 19 - @entity30 ( h ) - @entity18 feb 22 - @entity32 ( a ) - @entity31 feb 26 - @entity30 ( a ) - @entity18 mar 1 - @entity35 ( h ) - @entity31 ‘ now we ’ll recover and look forward to the @entity18 because it ’s a competition , like the @entity14 , we want to do well in			1
’ however , @entity5 is under no illusion that the competition will have an impact on the rest of @entity2 ’s campaign			1
‘ there is no doubt that you ’re always playing catch - up			2
but it ’s a @entity62 competition , so it ’s a very prestigious tournament			0
and a @entity12 place for the winner makes it more attractive but there is still a way to go before you can think of that			0
@entity69 produced an assured performance in the heart of the midfield for @entity2 the @entity14 sixth - round draw will be made at 7.35pm on monday , before kick - off in @entity76 's fifth - round tie with @entity77			1
@entity2 ( @entity78 : 5/2 ) 2			1
@entity79 ( 13/8 ) 3			0
@entity80 ( 16/1 ) 4			0
@entity81 ( 10/1 ) 5			0
@entity82 ( 66/1 ) 6			0
@entity83 ( 28/1 ) 7			0
@entity84 ( 33/1 ) 8			0
@entity76 ( 150/1 ) or @entity77 ( 3/1 ) ‘ certainly we ’re very focused on doing well in it			0
the players are young and hungry and this is a group who can grow over the next couple of years			0
' but we would like to get a trophy to signify that growth so the @entity18 is a competition we will take seriously			1
’ saturday ’s win at @entity49 brought to an end @entity2 ’s recent @entity16 hoodoo			1
when @entity49 took the lead through @entity99 , it looked as if @entity101 ’s side would maintain their hold over @entity5 ’ team			2
however , @entity2 hit back with two goals in nine minutes through @entity19 and @entity46			2
so @entity101 ’s sole focus now is to ensure @entity49 retain their @entity31 status , with the manager saying the appointments of @entity109 at @entity110 and @entity111 at @entity80 will change the dynamic of the relegation battle			1
‘ a new manager is going to have an impact at some stage , ’ said @entity101			0
‘ players have got a new challenge , a new start to a degree			0
those managers will be using those factors			0
@entity5 gave credit to @entity124 ( centre ) for his role in @entity46 's ( left ) winner ' of course now it is going to be a really tough race			0
the prize is getting bigger and bigger each year and the pressure on the managers gets bigger and bigger			0
’ on the appointment of @entity109 at @entity134 , @entity101 added : ‘ i am very , very pleased that we have a black manager in the @entity31			2
it has been a long time coming and i am really pleased for him and for the @entity31			2
’ @entity49 find out on monday if they face a second investigation in a week over missiles thrown by their fans after an incident following @entity19 ’s equaliser			1
a coin hit @entity147 ’s @entity146 during the draw at @entity16 on wednesday			0
new manager @entity101 ’s sole focus now is to ensure @entity49 retain their @entity31 status @entity99 ( second left ) celebrates scoring in the first half for @entity49 against @entity2			1

@entity2 beat @entity49 2 - 1 in the @entity14 to reach the quarter - final
the @entity156 next face @entity30 at home in the @entity18 on thursday
@entity2 then go to @entity32 in the @entity31 and the away trip to @entity30 , before facing @entity35 at @entity9 on march 1
