nearly 70 years after the end of the @entity3 , the name of @entity1 is etched in the nation 's consciousness			1
for many it is synonymous with spying , code - breaking , intelligence and subterfuge , the place where @entity13 's best brains were pushed to the limit of their capabilities to undermine the relentless @entity18 war machine			1
yet @entity20 , in @entity19 , was just one of countless stately homes across @entity13 without which the nation 's ability to counter the @entity25 threat would have been so much the weaker			1
soldiers at the @entity27 in the film @entity28 as conflict became inevitable and all attempts at appeasement failed , country houses such as @entity20 were commandeered in their thousands for the war effort and transformed into hospitals , schools , barracks , listening and monitoring centres , military command headquarters and stores for national art treasures - even , in one case , accommodation for displaced royalty			1
@entity46 , in @entity45 , became the wartime home of the country 's most distinguished evacuee , @entity48 , mother of the reigning monarch , @entity50			1
its owners , the @entity51 and @entity51 of @entity52 , were allocated two bedrooms and a sitting room while the royal visitor , who arrived in true diva style in september 1939 with 50 staff and more than 70 pieces of luggage , had the run of the rest of the house			2
hitherto an entirely urban dweller , @entity48 grew to love the rural life , once remarking to her niece during a stroll in the countryside , ' is that what hay looks like ? i never knew			2
' keeping up standards became part of @entity75 's self - imposed war work			1
a fellow inhabitant of @entity77 describes an emergency visit to the great house 's underground air raid shelter			1
' there i was in the middle of the night with my hair all anyhow and in a filthy old dressing gown ; and there in the shelter sat @entity48 , perfectly dressed with her pearls , doing a crossword puzzle			0
i never did that again			0
' troops at @entity91 in @entity92 from a potentially uneasy mix of military and civilian personnel , aristocrats and @entity99 evacuees , lifelong bonds and friendships were formed			0
@entity100 , the seat of the @entity102 in @entity103 , became a refuge for the girls from the @entity106 in @entity107 , and the octogenarian aristocrat delighted in attending concerts given by them as well as pottering around the grounds with his young visitors in the company of his ancient dog			1
the girls , in turn , became fond of their venerable host , according to a diary kept by @entity118 , the art mistress			0
when lord @entity119 died just after the war the girls paid their respects , forming a guard of honour on the front steps when his coffin left the house			1
the deaf and elderly lord @entity128 at @entity129 , in @entity130 , was equally delighted to share his vast ancestral home with 40 evacuee children from @entity133			0
as a change from his habitual rather solitary existence , he spent much of the war sitting by a roaring log fire with an assortment of his guests , a ' lot of dogs ' , according to reports , and his drinks table			1
@entity144 , in @entity145 , the birthplace and ancestral home of @entity13 's wartime prime minister @entity147 , also played host to a school – in this case the displaced pupils of @entity152 in @entity153			1
but their stay was a brief one			0
in the autumn of 1940 @entity144 was taken over by @entity157 , which moved there from another temporary home , @entity161 prison in west @entity99			0
the state rooms were divided up into offices for the national security service and filled with filing cabinets and trestle tables			0
soldiers being nursed in one of the halls of @entity170 nissen huts and @entity173 trucks took over the magnificent forecourt			1
although supposedly top secret , the identity of the palace 's new occupants soon became common knowledge , the conductors on local buses habitually calling out ' anyone for @entity157 ? ' when they reached @entity144 's gates			1
@entity185 , in @entity184 , became a military hospital where badly injured soldiers were sent to recover in mind and body , with the lovely architecture and gardens providing part of the cure			1
pictures from the time show nurses and patients getting lost together in the estate 's magnificent maze			1
@entity200 , countess of @entity201 , whose home , @entity203 in @entity204 , fulfilled a similar function , wrote , ' the patients had the free run of the place and loved and respected it			0
it seemed to bring the best out in them - they came out of hell and found themselves in heaven			0
' @entity216 , in @entity215 , was one of several stately homes in the @entity219 used as prisoner - of - war camps , the location being around 60 miles from the coast and thus thought to be off - putting to potential absconders			1
not that @entity216 's occupants showed much interest in escaping , if local memories are to be believed			1
most of them were @entity229 soldiers who spent their time falling in love with the local girls , stripping the silk damask from the walls of the historic mansion to make gifts and keepsakes for their sweethearts			1
@entity239 in @entity240 was chosen to house the treasures of the @entity242 , largely because its stable doors were tall enough to admit @entity245 's equestrian portrait of @entity246 but even then the priceless artworks were not immune from risk			1
in a letter to his boss in @entity99 , assistant keeper @entity252 wrote , ' for your most secret ear , one of our troubles at @entity239 is that the owner is celebrating the war by being fairly constantly drunk			1
he stumbled with a dog into the dining room ( where many of the paintings were being restored ) a few days ago ; this will not happen again			0
' @entity100 , became a refuge for the girls from the @entity106 in @entity107 once described as one of the most important artistic properties in @entity267 , @entity268 , near @entity269 in @entity103 , had been used as a military hospital during the @entity271 before becoming a magnet for painters , writers and socialites during the 20s and 30s			1
these included @entity278 , who was on hand at the beginning of the @entity3 to photograph some of the 40 nursery school children who arrived in 1939 during the first wave of evacuations from the capital , as they played on the cedar - shaded lawns			2
@entity287 's war was not , however , a happy one			1
in june 1940 the nursery children were moved on and the house was requisitioned as the @entity173 's @entity291 headquarters			2
it was in one of @entity287 's reception rooms that the d - day landings were planned - the paintings by @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 , @entity296 and @entity297 that had lined its walls having been stacked away in the mansion 's cellars			2
but as in so many requisitioned properties , the military invasion took a toll			0
as a result of the traffic of soldiers ' feet , its magnificent @entity310 staircase gave way with an almighty crash early one morning in june 1941			2
such dramas were repeated all over the country			0
staircases were chopped up for firewood ; paintings and panelling used as dart boards ; jeeps and armoured vehicles driven into lakes and up staircases ; gardens concreted over ; statues beheaded and conservatories machine - gunned			0
@entity91 in @entity332 , which was housing a battalion , also had its gardens and park torn up and compulsorily open - cast mined for coal , causing horrendous structural damage			0
in an extravagant good - riddance gesture to the wartime years , departing troops at @entity339 in @entity340 left all the taps on , bringing the ceilings down , rotting the woodwork and forcing its demolition			0
in @entity349 , @entity347 's herd of red deer was shot and eaten			2
perhaps unfairly , the @entity351 soldiers stationed in the south of @entity267 took the blame for much of the damage – perhaps it was easier for locals to blame foreign troops rather than their own			2
the major portion of beautiful @entity359 , also in @entity349 , was gutted by @entity351 troops during a party in 1943			2
at @entity363 in @entity184 soldiers carved their names , addresses and numbers in the balustrade of the elegant bridge in the park			2
and yet despite the dreadful loss of such a significant swathe of @entity13 's heritage , the majority of houses were restored and survived even without vandalism , fire was a hazard at a time when virtually everybody smoked			1
dozens of country houses were burned to the ground , others were left in such poor condition in 1945 that they seemed beyond restoration			0
without proper maintenance , pipes burst , ceilings collapsed and dry rot rampaged			0
a staggering 1,000 country houses were demolished in the decade between 1945 and 1955 as a result of wartime mistreatment - the destruction has been compared to the dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century			0
and yet despite the dreadful loss of such a significant swathe of @entity13 's heritage , the majority of houses were restored and survived			1
beginning with @entity400 , in @entity340 , @entity100 and @entity347 in 1947 , an increasing number threw open their doors to the public			0
not only did this make them eligible for repair grants , but it also gave them a vital means of upkeep too			2
nearly all the larger houses that took this step survived and flourished			0
two or three generations on , they have been fully refurbished and brought back to life , and it is now hard to recall the state they were in following the end of hostilities			0
others , such as @entity422 in @entity423 and @entity424 in @entity425 , remained in military use			0
as for @entity1 , the outbreak of war in 1939 saw an unexpected reversal in its fortunes			2
it had been scheduled for demolition in the late 30s to make way for a new suburb as part of what is now @entity437			2
but so great was its fame following its requisitioning that its longtime survival , now as a museum , was ensured			0
a grateful nation took it to their hearts , and there it has remained			0
like so many of @entity13 's other stately homes - even those with histories going back centuries - the war years really were its finest hour			1
