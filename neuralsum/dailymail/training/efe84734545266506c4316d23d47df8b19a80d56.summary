you leave the house , hop on the train and head to the gym			0

‘ it ’s a time that is n’t quite here yet , but it ’s not far away			0
innovations like @entity7 band are bringing it closer every day			1
’ the @entity7 bands , which are rubberised and waterproof , have the security benefit that they are less likely to be lost or stolen than a wallet or purse			2

in @entity23 , the @entity7 band can be used instead of oyster cards or contactless - enabled cards that commuters use to get around the capital , charging the same fares			1
the bands are part of a wider revolution in wearable technology which will allow people to negotiate daily life without using cash because it is worn on the wrist , there ’s no need to dig around in a handbag for a purse , frantically hunt for a wallet or carry around a separate card holder			0

” ‘ @entity7 band from @entity8 is about making paying for everyday essentials simpler than ever			1
’ banks and retailers are desperate to encourage the public to switch to electronic payments , rather than real cash , notes and coins which are expense to handle and transport			0
the 10,000 bands that are being released in @entity23 will be free of charge , while there is no fee for making purchases in this way - at least for now			2
