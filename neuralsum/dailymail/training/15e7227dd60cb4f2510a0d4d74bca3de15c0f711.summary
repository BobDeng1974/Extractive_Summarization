mr @entity22 had to break the news to his eldest daughter after police came round to their house in @entity34 , @entity35 , to take statements about his time with the killer			1
he spent 12 years in an on - off relationship with @entity5 before finally pulling the plug on their chaotic relationship in 2009			1
since then @entity5 has not tried once to visit the girls			1
‘ we ’ve not heard a peep out of her in years , ’ said mr @entity22 said			1
‘ my eldest daughter knew her mother had been arrested and we were all very , very shocked			0

‘ my youngest is only seven and i ’ve chosen not to tell her about it as she is too young to understand			0
she does n’t even know @entity54 is her mother			0

’ lovers : @entity5 and @entity68 pose lovingly together in 2004 mum : @entity5 with her first daughter , who is now 14 and read about her murders in the papers mr @entity22 decided to flee to safety with his two daughters after putting up with years of drinking , drug - taking and infidelity			1
the final straw came in 2009 when @entity5 , who had left the family home , turned up drunk late one evening and pulled a dagger from the inside of her knee - length leather boot			1

her other two victims , who were also stabbed to death , were found dumped a short distance away four days later			2
she will undoubtedly be handed one of the biggest prison sentences ever for a woman at the conclusion of the court case			0
it is a far cry from the lively 15 - year - old that mr @entity22 met in 1997 when she bounded up to him in a park as he walked his @entity118 shepherd and exclaimed : ‘ i really love dogs			2
’ the pair immediately hit it off and , despite mr @entity22 being six years her senior , they became a couple			2

periods of stability were interspersed with breaks in the relationship when @entity5 ’s drinking , promiscuity and reckless behaviour drove them apart			2
