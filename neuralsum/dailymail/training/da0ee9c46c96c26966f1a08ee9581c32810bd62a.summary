widow @entity8 , 94 ( left ) , and only daughter @entity9 , 64 ( right ) , were found dead at their home in @entity24 , @entity25			1
it is feared they could have died after breathing in fumes as they struggled to stay warm officers and fire crews forced entry to the terraced home in @entity37 just before 7pm on monday to find the pair in the living room			1
@entity40 say they had taken to sleeping downstairs in front of the gas fire - believed to be the only source of heating in the house - in a bid to keep warm			1
an inquiry is now underway to try and establish the circumstances surrounding their deaths , and to determine when either of the pair were last seen alive			2
but family say wheelchair bound mrs @entity8 , who was cared for by her unmarried daughter , was warned about a possible problem with the fire before @entity57			1
@entity8 's sister - in - law @entity58 , 84 , said : ' we went round in december and my daughter 's boyfriend said " i think you should get your gas fire looked at "			1
' the flames were burning white and not blue like normal so he told her to get it sorted			0
' she said there was a routine service due in february so she would get it fixed then			2
' the service was booked in a few days â€™ time			0
my advice to people who think there 's a problem with their fire is do n't let it happen to you , get it checked and do n't put it off			2
' police said they are currently treating the deaths as unexplained , and forensic experts are now combing the house			2
wheelchair bound mrs @entity8 , who was cared for by her unmarried daughter , was warned about a possible problem with the fire before @entity57 mrs @entity58 added that @entity8 - known as ' @entity87 ' to her family - had been experiencing declining health over the last 12 months			1
she said : ' @entity8 's legs had gone so she slept downstairs in the living room and @entity9 would usually go up to bed after making sure her mum was warm and had enough blankets			1
' we do n't know for certain what happened but they were probably overcome by the fumes and died together			0
' @entity9 doted on her mum completely , she never went out apart from to get groceries			2
@entity9 lived in that house all her life - 64 years			1
' she only had one job her whole life , working for social security and she went about as high as she could go in that job			0
' it 's strange that they died as they lived - together			2
' mrs @entity58 said she and husband @entity109 , 89 , @entity8 's brother , were ' shocked ' by the deaths			2
neighbour @entity111 , 69 , said that her daughter raised the alarm after they had n't seen the pair for four days			1
she said : ' they kept themselves to themselves mostly , @entity8 had been very ill so she mostly stayed in the house			1
' you 'd sometimes see @entity121 push her out in a wheelchair but only to go to the park or something like that			0
we started to get worried after my husband noticed milk bottles had n't been collected			1
' i went around there three times yesterday , i was banging away on the window , lifting the letterbox up , calling @entity121 's name , thinking they 'd answer but they did n't			0
' in the day the curtains were open but i could n't see through the net inside			0
later on i went round when it had got darker and could see that the fire was on			2
' i tapped on the window at about half past five and there was still no answer			0
my daughter came round and called the police at about half past six			2
' she explained how worried we were and they came round at about 7.30			0
officers and fire crews forced entry to the terraced home in @entity37 just before 7pm on monday to find the pair in the living room @entity40 say the pair had taken to sleeping downstairs in front of the gas fire - the only source of heating in the house - in a bid to keep warm ' by 8pm there were police cars and fire engines and ambulances outside			1
a couple of plain clothes police came to visit at 10.30 last night and told us there were suspicious circumstances			0
' they asked if we had seen anything suspicious around the corner but we had n't			0
i was shocked when i found out , we all were			0
' they were nice people , @entity121 was a very caring girl , a lovely person really			0
i used to see her leaving for work and she 'd just be walking up the street looking back and waving goodbye to her mum			0
' i think she retired a few years ago to look after her mum full time			0
' mrs @entity111 believed that the pair had been sleeping downstairs in the living room with the gas fire on to escape the recent cold weather			1
she added : ' they have been sleeping downstairs in the living room			1
' their house did n't have central heating , most of them do n't around here so people sleep downstairs with the gas fire on			1
' the police asked me if i knew whether they had been sleeping downstairs			1
' my daughter told me to get mine checked so maybe i will now			2
' det insp @entity197 , of @entity198 , said neighbours had contacted police out of concern that neither woman had been seen for some time			0
' they could see the fire was on through the window but were n't getting an answer at the door			0
the cause of their deaths have yet to be established and a postmortem will be carried out in due course			0
' the women are yet to be formally identified and efforts are ongoing to trace their next of kin			0
' however , we would appeal for anyone who knew their movements , may have seen them within the last week , or who saw anything suspicious in @entity37 to contact police on the 101 number			0
