loves the @entity0 , but tweets with the @entity1 : @entity3 's endorsement of @entity5 's tablet was marred by her choice of @entity8 client @entity3 has been vocal about her love for @entity5 's new surface tablet , claiming earlier this month that it was one of her favourite things			1
but that did n't stop the chat show queen sending a tweet claiming she 'd bought 12 as @entity19 gifts - via the @entity8 app on her @entity1			1
@entity5 has spent $ 1.5billion and enlisted a string of celebrities to help market their latest gadget - a rival to @entity26 's offering			1
@entity28 , @entity29 and @entity3 have all endorsed @entity30 and its mobile phone equivalent , with the latter putting the surface on her list of 48 favourite things , @entity27 reported			1
however , the latest pr gaffe seems to suggest that however much @entity3 promotes @entity5 's latest tech offering , she likes @entity26 's version even more			2
but @entity3 's choice of platform highlights the dearth of decent @entity8 apps for @entity0 operating system @entity43 , @entity27 suggests			0
@entity8 itself is yet to release an official @entity8 client in the @entity46 , but the social messaging site 's apps remain among the most popular programs on other platforms			0
it is thought that @entity8 's delay in releasing an official @entity43 app is a sign that big app developers are not allocating the same resources to @entity46 apps			0
but even if @entity3 had not been able to track down one of the several third - party @entity8 apps that have been published for the @entity0 , she could have still accessed the @entity8 website to send her tweet			0
instead , it appears she used @entity8 's official app on the @entity1 to send the tweet			0
@entity3 's tweet : she is one of a string of celebrities enlisted by @entity5 to support their latest products @entity3 's slip is just the latest blow to @entity5 after the launch of the @entity0 was marred by a string of negative reviews and , two weeks later , resignation of the head of its @entity78 division			1
the tablet , which is on the market for between £ 399 and £ 559 , was met with a lukewarm response , with reviewers criticising its lack of apps and branding it ' a compromise '			0
even the most positive review , from technology magazine @entity86 , would only go so far as describing the tablet as ' quite good '			0
lukewarm response : the release of @entity5 's @entity1 rival was marred by a string of negative reviews and , two weeks later , the resignation of the head of the company 's @entity78 division the price is the same as the cheapest @entity1 , pitching @entity5 into a head to head battle with @entity26 , which has a far greater consumer electronics pedigree			1
the chaos which met the product launch was underlined by the departure of @entity103 , head of @entity5 's @entity78 unit , a 23 - year @entity5 veteran widely tipped as the company 's next chief executive			2
@entity107 contacted @entity5 for a comment on the @entity3 gaffe , but by the time of publication had received no response .			2

chat show queen claimed earlier this month that the @entity1 rival was one of her favourite things
gaffe is the latest blow to @entity5 whose recent product launches have been marred by bad publicity
