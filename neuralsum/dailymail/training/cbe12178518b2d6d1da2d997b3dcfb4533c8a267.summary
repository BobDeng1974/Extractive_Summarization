an @entity1 man who served in @entity2 but later deserted because he believed the conflict breached international law , could win the right to claim asylum in the @entity7 , according to the bloc 's top court			1
the @entity10 is to rule on the opinion in the coming months			0
if confirmed , it could increase asylum claim rights to @entity15 citizens who face a court - martial or other punishments at home for refusing military service			0
@entity20 , 37 , from @entity21 , enlisted in the @entity22 in 2003 and was deployed to @entity2 in 2004 , where he maintained @entity25 helicopters			1
@entity20 is fighting to gain asylum in the @entity7 after deserting the @entity1 military when he refused to return to @entity2 in 2007 ; a leading advocate says he could win his case @entity20 was deployed to @entity2 in 2004 to maintain @entity25 helicopters , as seen above ; he re-enlisted in 2005 but later decided the war was illegal and deserted rather than following an order to return there in 2007 he re-enlisted in 2005 , but later decided the war was illegal and failed to go to @entity2 when ordered to do so in 2007			1
mr @entity20 , who was based in @entity33 , unsuccessfully sought asylum there , then later appealed the decision			2
before reaching a decision , a @entity33 court sought clarifications on several points of @entity7 asylum law from the @entity10			2
when they receive those opinions , the court will then decide on mr @entity20 's case			2
an opinion on the case by advocate general @entity47 yesterday is n't binding on the @entity10 , but the court generally follows such recommendations , @entity44 reported			0
however , she said it was up to the @entity33 court to examine the case and decide whether the punishment mr @entity20 would face if convicted , would act as an act or persecution			2
the @entity57 court did n't have enough evidence to rule on that , the advocate general said			0
another central question in @entity7 asylum law was whether there was a reasonable likelihood the person deployed to a war zone would be involved in war crimes , her opinion said			1
the @entity33 court would also need to answer that			0
@entity69 's lawyer said his client only agreed to re-enlist after being told he would n't be sent back to @entity2 mrs @entity47 said : ' what matters is the likelihood that the applicant risks committing war crimes			1
it is not necessary to establish beyond reasonable doubt that violations of international criminal law can be expected to occur , ' she said			0
even though mr @entity20 was in a noncombat role , she said the right to claim asylum because of war crimes should apply to him			1
she said it was n't relevant in this case that mr. @entity20 did n't apply for conscientious objection to @entity1 authorities because that would n't have stopped his redeployment			1
the @entity10 usually takes three to six months to make a final ruling			0
mr @entity20 's lawyer , @entity90 , said the opinion backed the arguments he was already making			0
he said client , currently living in @entity94 , could face up to 18 months jail in the @entity1 for desertion and had only agreed to re-enlist after being told his unit would n't be sent back to @entity2			1
the case is the first dealing with an asylum request for a @entity1 military employee in the @entity7 , mr @entity90 said			1
rates of desertion in the @entity104 significantly during the @entity2 war			2
in 2007 nine in every 1,000 soldiers deserted during that financial year			0
the rates , however , were significantly higher during the @entity109 .			0

@entity20 served in @entity2 in 2004 in a noncombat role
he re-enlisted but refused to return in 2007 , claiming the war was illegal
and that he only did so after being told he would n't be sent back to @entity2
the case is the first asylum request for a @entity1 military employee in the @entity7
