by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 12:59 est , 13 february 2013 updated : 02:40 est , 14 february 2013 battle : the wine companies who lay claim to the distinctive @entity8 logo of a leaping baby antelope have lodged a @entity11 writ against @entity12 one is instantly recognisable as the logo of @entity8 sparkling perry			1
the other adorned @entity12 products at @entity17 – but has left some feeling anything but festive			1
@entity8 has launched legal proceedings against the @entity21 homeware company , claiming its use of a baby deer with a ribbon on its neck infringed the drinks firm ’s rights			2
the @entity11 writ also claims that the appearance of the logo on @entity12 products aimed at under - 18s associates @entity8 ‘ with a blatant disregard for industry codes of practice to protect children ’			1
the @entity38 - based company behind the drink wants an injunction to stop @entity12 using the image , plus destruction of all products marked with it			2
but @entity12 denies perplexing shoppers , insisting that – although its seasonal deer image and the @entity8 logo are both ‘ hoofed ruminants , unaccustomed to wearing ribbons ’ – there is no confusing similarity between the two			1
lawyer @entity54 said : ‘ the differences in the manner of execution speak for themselves , not least			0
the absence of horns and the springing “ springbok ” stance			0
’ barrister @entity62 , for @entity63 and @entity64 , said in the writ : ' the claimants and their predecessors in title have , since 1953 , used in relation to @entity8 sparkling perry and related goods various iterations of a logo with the common theme of a baby chamois with a ribbon tied round its neck			2
' indeed @entity8 was the first alcoholic brand and the second ever brand to be advertised on commercial television in the @entity21 with a campaign in 1957			0
' @entity12 has used and continues to use a logo in relation to its @entity85 advertising campaign and range of related goods , which depicts a baby deer with a ribbon tied around its neck , which is substantially similar to the @entity8 logo , ' adds mr @entity62			1
' their use in the course of trade of the @entity96 without due cause in relation to goods similar to those for which the registered marks are registered , take unfair advantage of , and is detrimental to , the distinctive character and repute of the @entity8 logo , ' it states			2
' a drink , its packaging and any promotional material or activity should not in any direct or indirect way have a particular appeal to under - 18s			0
the use of the @entity96 includes use on products relevant to under 18s , such as children 's clothes ' the application of the @entity96 to goods relevant to under - 18s is liable to cause serious tarnishing and detriment to the repute of @entity124 by associating ( it ) in the minds of the public and trade with a blatant disregard for industry codes of practise to protect children			0

iconic : the famous @entity8 leaping chamois logo , depicted on a 70 's beermat ' it is denied that any of the said deer are " substantially similar " to any of the chamois			1
' while it can not be denied that , by nature , deer and chamois are both hoofed ruminants , unaccustomed to wearing ribbons , the differences in the manner of execution speak for themselves , not least arising out of the absence of horns and the springing " springbok " stance			0
