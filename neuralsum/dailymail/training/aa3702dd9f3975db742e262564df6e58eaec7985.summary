figures released by @entity3 ' @entity2 show around one in 10 local authority home is now occupied by foreign tenants around one in ten local authority homes were let last year to foreign tenants , figures showed last night			1
the proportion has soared since @entity10 entered @entity11			1
last year , 9 per cent of social housing properties which were let out were occupied by foreign tenants – up from 6 per cent in the final year of the last @entity15 government			0
the statistics , released by @entity3 ’ @entity2 , show that this proportion of lettings is the highest in @entity19 since at least 2006/7			1
the figures also show that the number of homes let out to @entity23 had doubled since the @entity24 was formed in 2010 to 4 per cent			1
the @entity2 document said this could be down to the fact that @entity28 ’s borders have been opened to @entity29 and @entity30			1
the figures are another problem for @entity10 as he struggles to persuade voters the @entity34 can get to grips with immigration			1
ministers have already been forced to admit they will not meet the election pledge to cut net migration to the tens of thousands by next eyar			0
latest figures show that annual net migration is now at 260,000 – higher than when they took office			2
last month , mr @entity10 unveiled proposals to prevent migrants from accessing social housing until they have been paying tax in this country for at least four years			1
the increase was condemned by the cross-party @entity50 on balanced migration , chaired by @entity15 ’s @entity52 and the @entity53 ’ sir @entity54			0
in a statement , they said : ‘ the proportion of social housing going to @entity60 nationals continues to increase			2
‘ this nationwide figure of one in ten disguises local variations where the impact has been much higher			2
a stronger priority for social housing should be given to long - standing local residents			2
’ the @entity2 document , @entity69 , said that 91 per cent of social properties are occupied by @entity28 nationals and 4 per cent by @entity23 – that is people from @entity29 , the @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity30 , @entity79 and @entity80			1
a further 1 per cent are occupied by people from other @entity83 countries , and 4 per cent by other @entity85 nationals			0
the @entity86 , pictured above , said ‘ it is in everyone ’s interest to remove unnecessary barriers which prevent homes being made available to those people who desperately need them ' ‘ the proportion of tenants who were @entity28 nationals fell by 1 percentage point a year from 2009/10 to 2012/13 and remained static in 2013/14 , whilst those from @entity100 countries has rsien slowly from 1 per cent in 2007/08 to 4 per cent in 2013/14 , ’ the document said			1
‘ a factor in this could be that since 2008/9 , the list of @entity100 countries has expanded to include @entity29 and @entity30			0
’ @entity100 countries are @entity23 countries who joined the @entity83 in 2004			0
they do not include @entity29 and @entity30 , who joined later			0
a spokesman for the @entity86 said : ‘ it is in everyone ’s interest to remove unnecessary barriers which prevent homes being made available to those people who desperately need them			0
‘ councils are keen to play their part in this and could go further and faster to support the development of badly needed new homes if @entity118 gave councils greater financial flexibility			0
’ housing minister @entity121 said that the figures would fall next year after new measures introduced by the government			0
‘ these figures do not take account of the new guidance we ’ve put in place to ensure councils are completely clear about who they have given social homes to , so communities can be confident they are not losing out , ’ he said			1
‘ for years families suffered the blatant unfairness of watching as people with no job or connection to the local area were given council homes			2
under this government new rules make crystal clear that local people and members of the @entity146 are at the front of the queue for council homes in their area			2
‘ as a result , i expect next year ’s figures to change as councils put these rules into practice			0

one in 10 new local authority homes now let out to tenant born outside @entity28
@entity2 released figures
the proportion is said to have soared since @entity10 came into power
