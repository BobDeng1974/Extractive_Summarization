@entity0 was suspended from a @entity2 catholic school after he refused to cut his long curly hair but he can keep his hairstyle after winning his fight in the high court today a student has won his @entity9 battle to keep his hair long after he was suspended from school because he looked ' unruly '			1
@entity0 , 16 , was sent home last month from @entity13 , in @entity14 , @entity2 , for not adhering to the rule that states students must keep their hair ‘ short , tidy , off their collars and out of their eyes ’			1
principal @entity21 told @entity0 he could return once he had his hair cut - but the student argued his naturally curly hair would look ' boofy ' if cropped and he was prepared to wear it tied back in order to comply with the school 's standards			1
but @entity2 high court judge @entity29 ruled that @entity0 ’s actions did not warrant suspension as his conduct was not harmful to his fellow students			1
he also said the school had not provided enough clarity on the hair rules to ensure students complied with them			0
when the case began , the teen ’s lawyer , @entity39 , likened @entity0 to @entity42 for standing up for his rights			0

judge @entity29 said that one of @entity0 ’s lawyers had tried to provide the school board 's disciplinary committee with statements from two hairdressers , one of whom said @entity0 's hair was already short and would ‘ look like " an untidy afro '' if it was cut shorter , ’ but that the committee apparently chose not to accept the testimony			1
parents @entity76 and @entity77 said in a statement that their son had never broken the rules because his bun kept his hair off his collar and out of his eyes			0
' in 2014 , when girls ' hair lengths at school are n't questioned , why should the rules be different for boys ? ' his parents said			0
' the criticism we have received as parents has been hurtful and unnecessary			0
