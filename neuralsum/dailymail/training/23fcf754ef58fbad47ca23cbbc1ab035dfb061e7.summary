celebrity chef @entity0 has leapt to the defence of @entity2 who was blasted by the @entity5 child commissioner for being a 'd * * * head ' on tuesday after he admitted he disciplined his daughter by feeding her one of the world 's hottest chilis			1
@entity2 admitted on monday that when one of his four young children became unruly or disrespectful , he would coat their sliced apple with a type of chili known as the scotch bonnet - because ' you ca n't smack naughty kids '			1
in an interview with @entity22 to mark shopsmall month , the @entity20 owner @entity0 said : ' look , i probably would n't do that			1
i 've had some fun with my kids over the years			0
it 's all in jest , all a bit of fun			1
' no one 's going to hurt their kid			2
i do n't think @entity2 went out there to make his kids suffer			1
someone 's taken it a bit too far			1
scotch bonnets have a rating on the @entity63 scale , which measures chili heat , of 100,000 to 350,000 , making them up to 140 times hotter than a normal chili pepper			1
speaking with @entity69 's @entity68 , mr @entity40 said , ' he 's a d * * * head @entity71			1
it 's just not appropriate to use cruelty as a form of discipline			1
' mr @entity40 went on to say that @entity2 's chili trick was a form of ' child abuse '			1
' this bloke , he should realise the influence he has as a high - profile public figure and a high - profile father , ' mr @entity40 said			1
' if he 's joking it 's not even appropriate because some parents and families might think it 's a legitimate or alternative way of disciplining children			1
he 's way off the planet as far as i 'm concerned			2
' a scorcher : the ' scotch bonnet ' chili ( pictured ) that @entity2 feeds his children is 140 hotter than a normal pepper mr @entity40 was responding to @entity2 's confession about how he disciplines his children , saying on monday , ' i give them chillies for punishment			1
it is not very popular beating kids any more , it 's not very fashionable and you are not allowed to do it and if you are a celebrity chef like me it does not look very good in the paper			1
so you need a few options			0
' @entity2 said he had once tricked his 12 - year - old daughter into eating an ultra-hot @entity107 , much to the annoyance of his wife , @entity42			1
at the @entity111 @entity110 , @entity2 said : ' @entity45 was quite disrespectful and rude to me and she pushed her luck			1
in my day i would have got a bit of a telling - off but you are not allowed to do that			2
' five minutes later she thought i had forgotten and i had n't			0
she asked for an apple			2
i cut it up into several pieces and rubbed it with @entity107 and it worked a treat			0
she ran up to mum and said , ' this is peppery '			0
i was in the corner laughing			0
[ @entity42 ] said to me , ' do n't you ever do that again '			0
' mr @entity40 , who is @entity5 's @entity129 , said @entity2 's role as an educator made his actions even more troubling			1
' he purports to be a teacher and a role model and works with children			2
if he worked in a school in @entity5 they 'd sack him , ' he said			2
given his struggle to impose order on daughters @entity142 , @entity143 , 11 , and @entity144 , five , and son @entity145 , four , perhaps it is no surprise @entity2 is not keen to add to his family			2
he revealed he argued with his wife of 14 years about the idea , saying : ' you know what she said last night ? she is 40 in about ten days and i took her out and she goes , ' ok are we going to have another kid then ? ' i said , ' you what ? '			0

for the top chef , @entity159 is a time of family and friends , and he keeps his restaurants closed for the day			1
' we do n't open @entity159 and the reason why we do n't is i spent many , many years as a young chef working @entity159			1
