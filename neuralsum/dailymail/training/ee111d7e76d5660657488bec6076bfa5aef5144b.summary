some may associate @entity0 more with prawn sandwich eaters than hearty singers , but this weekend 's @entity4 action appears to show that those inside @entity6 's stadium know how to belt out a song better than most			1
in the wake of @entity11 boss @entity10 saying he felt his side had been ' playing in an empty stadium ' last weekend , debate has raged about possible reasons behind any crowd apathy			0
ticket prices have been put forward as mitigation , as have all - seater stadiums and a growing number of day - trippers to grounds			0
@entity6 fans at the @entity23 of @entity0 make their voices heard at the stadium in a bid to try and see if @entity10 's words were true of other @entity4 grounds , @entity26 armed its reporters with a the ' @entity32 ' smartphone application which would attempt to record decibel levels at this weekend 's games			1
while this level of research can in no way be considered scientific and is nothing more than a rough guide , it does indicate that @entity6 and @entity41 fans made more of a din than any others by as many as six decibels , although for balance there were 30,000 more fans there than anywhere else			2
in the interests of fairness , all samples were taken from kick - off to the 60 - second mark , the highest recorded point has been used and , as no goals were scored in this period , the decibel levels can be considered to have been generated in similar circumstances			1
@entity11 manager @entity10 recently criticised @entity60 fans for the lack of atmosphere at @entity63 the recordings will be repeated at the next round of @entity4 games in order to gather readings from every ground			0
here are the results , with accompanying reference points from our reporters			0
