by @entity0 last updated at 7:32 am on 16th december 2011 tensions in @entity2 took on a literary flavour yesterday as the @entity4 snatched a tiny but historically priceless @entity6 manuscript from under the nose of a @entity9 museum			1
the unpublished work , written in 1830 when she was just 14 and containing a story which is a precursor to a famous passage in her novel @entity16 , was bought for a record £ 690,850 by @entity18 in @entity19 at auction			1
the @entity25 , in the literary family ’s home in @entity23 , @entity24 , was so keen to acquire the miniature treasure that it had launched a fundraising appeal before the sale at @entity29 in @entity30			2
tiny tale : the colourful tale of murder and madness is part of a 4,000 - word magazine with 19 pages , written by the young @entity6 it secured a £ 613,140 grant from the @entity40 , leaving enough to bid up to a hammer price of £ 560,000 for the work , which @entity6 wrote to entertain her sisters @entity44 and @entity45 , and brother @entity46			1
but after several minutes of intense bidding against the @entity4 , the museum team sadly had to stop when their rivals upped their offer by £ 20,000			2
the hand - written 19 - page miniature magazine , called @entity52 , sold for a hammer price of £ 580,000			1
the total sale price – including the buyer ’s premium , a commission routinely paid to the auctioneers on top of the hammer price – was £ 690,850 , well above the amount the @entity25 could afford			0
it was a new record at auction for a manuscript by any of the @entity43 , a @entity29 ’s spokesman said			2
@entity44 is best known for @entity66 , her only novel			0
@entity68 wrote @entity69 and @entity70			0
one of the tales in the manuscript is a precursor to a passage in @entity6 ’s 1847 novel @entity16 , in which mr @entity16 ’s insane wife @entity76 , who is kept in the attic , seeks revenge by setting fire to his bed curtains			1
the @entity52 tells of a murderer driven to madness after being haunted by his victim			0
‘ an immense fire ’ burns in his head and he envisages his bed curtains going up in flames			0
size of a credit card : reading the magazine requires a magnifying - glass as the entire manuscript is in miniature , the pages only 35 x 61mm after the auction , @entity96 , president of the @entity97 , said : ‘ this “ @entity109 ” puts down in luminous prose not only the daydreams of a little @entity24 girl , but it also contains the seed of the work of one of the greatest writers in the @entity108 language , @entity6			1
‘ it will not be going home , back to the place where it all began , the @entity110 at @entity23			0
its presence there would have placed it not only at the heart of the proud community in which she was born and raised , but would have brought full circle a @entity24 story , a @entity125 story , a @entity9 story , a world story			1
’ @entity127 , director of the @entity25 , added : ‘ this is unquestionably the most significant @entity6 manuscript to come to light in decades and an important part of our broader literary heritage			1
‘ it belongs in @entity23 and we are bitterly disappointed that scholars and members of the public may now not have the opportunity to study and enjoy it as part of our public collection			1
’ the @entity4 museum , on @entity19 ’s fashionable @entity142 , plans to exhibit the manuscript next month			2
it is one of the richest and most prestigious archives in @entity4 , and receives direct government funding through the country ’s @entity148			0
mr @entity127 said it was ‘ some consolation ’ that it would be on public display somewhere			0
he added that his museum would be seeking to contact the new owner with the hope that the manuscript might at least be loaned to it at some point			2
the miniature magazine , previously owned by an unnamed private collector in @entity2 , contains 4,000 words and each of its page measures just 1.4 in by 2.4 in			2
it is one of six volumes in a series of miniature magazines created by the young @entity43 , inspired by a box of toy soldiers bought for @entity46 by his father			0
they began creating tiny books for the toy soldiers to ‘ read ’			0
the @entity25 already owns four of the others			0
close - up : the manuscript , left , was written by @entity6 , right , to entertain her siblings			1

the 4,000 word short story was written in 1830 when @entity6 was just 14
@entity6 archivists ' bitterly disappointed ' the manuscript is leaving @entity9
