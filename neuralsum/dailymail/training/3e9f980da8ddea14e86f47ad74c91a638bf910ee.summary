bee populations have been falling rapidly in many countries , fuelled by a phenomenon known as colony collapse disorder parasitic mites have ' turbo - charged ' the spread of a deadly virus that is killing honey bee colonies around the world			1
bee populations have been falling rapidly in many countries , fuelled by a phenomenon known as colony collapse disorder			2
many suspects have been named for bee colony collapse , including popular pesticides			2
now @entity17 scientists studied the impact of a parasitic mite arriving in a fresh territory - @entity21 - and concluded that it is a prime suspect , since it spreads viruses while feeding on hemolymph , or bee 's ‘ blood ’			1
to clarify the link between mites and viruses , a team led by @entity32 of @entity33 's @entity17 studied the impact of @entity35 in @entity21 , which the mites have only recently invaded			1
they found the arrival of @entity35 increased the prevalence of a single type of virus , deformed wing virus ( @entity43 ) , in honey bees from around 10 % to 100 %			2
at the same time the amount of @entity43 virus in the bees ' bodies rocketed by a millionfold and there was a huge reduction in virus diversity , with a single strain of @entity43 crowding out others			0
‘ it is that strain that is now dominant around the world and seems to be killing bees , ’ @entity32 said in a telephone interview			0
‘ my money would be on this virus as being key			0
’ bloodsuckers : the presence of the @entity35 mite parasite increased the prevalence of a single type of virus , deformed wing virus ( @entity43 ) , in honey bees from around 10 % to 100 % other factors - including fungi , pesticides and decreased plant diversity - are thought to play a role in colony collapse , but @entity76 of the @entity77 said the latest findings pointed to the virus and mite combination as being the main culprit			1
‘ this data provides clear evidence that , of all the suggested mechanisms of honey bee loss , virus infection brought in by mite infestation is a major player in the decline , ’ he said			1
@entity76 , who was not involved the research , said the findings reinforced the need for beekeepers to control @entity35 infestation in colonies			0
the threat to bee populations extends across much of @entity98 and the @entity99 to @entity100 , @entity101 and the @entity102 , experts say			0
bees are important pollinators of flowering plants , including many fruit and vegetable crops .			0

study into impact of mite on ' fresh ' territory - @entity21 - has revealed *devastation* it can cause in bee colonies
mite carries deadly virus
it is ' prime suspect ' in worldwide colony deaths
