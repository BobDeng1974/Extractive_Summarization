the bizarre ruling was enforced at @entity11 primary school in @entity12 , @entity13 , this week			1
headteacher @entity14 wrote to parents telling them they were not invited to next month ’s event , which includes the traditional egg and spoon race , because of ' rising pupil numbers '			1

the newsletter to parents sent on monday stated : ' thursday 3rd july is planned for sports day			2
' unfortunately , due to rising pupil numbers , we will not be able to invite parents to sports day this year			2
' yesterday , furious parents blasted the decision branding it ' health and safety gone mad '			1
crowd control : the bizarre ruling was enforced at @entity11 primary school in @entity12 , @entity13 @entity49 , 35 , whose six - year - old son attends the school , said : ' this is bonkers			1
' we got a letter from school saying parents would not be invited to this year ’s sports day			1
' i rang the school up and spoke to someone who said it was because of health and safety			1
' i asked what that meant and the woman said it was because there were more pupils at the school and therefore more potential parents coming on sports day			1
' when i asked what the school was afraid might happen she said there was a potential for a crush			2
i said " what like @entity7 ? " sort of as a joke , and she said " yes "			0
' ' i was gobsmacked			0
i ’ve never heard anything do ridiculous in my life			0
' the school claims an increase in the number of parents could cause a crush on the playing fields ( pictured ) other parents threatened to boycott the sports day on july 3 in protest at the ban			1
@entity92 , 32 , whose two children @entity49 , 11 , and @entity94 , five , go to the school , said : ' i ’m not happy about this at all			2
' if we ca n’t watch , then my children will not be taking part in the sports day			0
' my son is in year 6 , so it will be his last sports day - i really want to see him compete			0
' the sports day is held on a massive field as well and it ’s never full			0
' they manage to cram all the parents into a school hall , but apparently we wo n’t be able to watch on the huge field			1
' @entity22 , 32 , whose six - year - old daughter @entity108 is in year 1 , added : ' i was absolutely fuming when i read the letter			0
' sports day should be a family event and parents should be able to share their child ’s excitement at taking part in all the races			1
the primary school became an academy in january 2013 and was rated ' good ' by @entity119 in its last inspection ' it ’s also a big part of growing up - i remember having my parents there at every sports day when i was a child			1
' they even used to take part in things like the egg - and - spoon race			0
' ms @entity22 said she was allowed to attend every sports day when her older daughter @entity131 , 13 , was a pupil at the school			2
she added : ' it just seems really unfair on @entity108 now , that she ca n’t have her mum and dad there like @entity131 did			0
' i just ca n’t understand the decision			2
it seems a big enough sports field to me and i do n’t think there are more pupils there than last year			0
' ' when you ’re a working parent , it ’s hard to get involved in school life , so you have to take every opportunity you can ' @entity147 , 26 , mother @entity147 , 26 , said her son @entity149 , eight , was upset to learn his parents would n’t be able to cheer him on			1
she said : ' i find it disgusting that the school are n’t giving us the choice over whether we want to come or not			2
' when you ’re a working parent , it ’s hard to get involved in school life , so you have to take every opportunity you can			2
' are they going to stop us watching the @entity161 plays next ? ' the primary school , which only became an academy in january 2013 , was rated ' good ' by @entity119 in their last inspection in june last year			1
inspectors reported that the school - which caters for boys and girls aged between 3 - 11 - had 318 pupils on the roll , an increase from 284 who attended in 2010			0
the teachers ’ union @entity173 also hit out at @entity11 , blaming their new status for the decision			1
@entity177 , secretary of the union in @entity179 , said : ' the decision to ban parents from sports day is another example of the loss of control the community feels when a local school becomes an academy and withdraws from local authority control			1
' decisions are made arbitrarily and without consultation			0
' ' safeguarding our children is our main priority ' @entity195 , chair of governors @entity197 , conservative @entity198 for the @entity200 , added : ' it ’s traditional that parents attend sports days and i ca n’t see any logic behind restricting them			0
' there ’s a benefit to both the children and the parents , who are proud to see their youngsters getting fit through sport			0
' the @entity212 has also criticised the school ’s decision			1
spokesman @entity215 said : ' schools always have reasons for making decisions but it ’s a shame this school has n’t made public its reasons			0
' parents always enjoy going to school sports days and it ’s important to have them there to encourage the children			1
' so much investment has been put into primary schools through the government ’s pe and school sport premium			2
' one of the things schools are expected to do with this is increase competitive opportunities for children			0
sports day would be an ideal opportunity to showcase how they are achieving this			0
' however , @entity195 , chairman of governors , said : ' no parent has contacted the school to comment on the matter of us being ' unable to invite ' parents to our sports day this year			2
' safeguarding our children is our main priority			0
we feel that due to the rise in pupil numbers along with the close proximity of current major road and tram works a lot of strangers are in and around our school locality			0
' because of this it would be extremely difficult for us to guarantee the safety of our children at an outdoor event with open gates ; this is why this year , this very difficult decision has had to be made			1
' our school offers parents lots of opportunities to come to special indoor events , such as @entity25 ’s @entity267 , our @entity268 , and @entity270 events which are happening in june and july			2
' the @entity7 disaster happened on april 15 , 1989 , at the @entity272 in @entity273 during a match between @entity275 and @entity276			0
a human crush resulted in the deaths of 96 people and injuries to 766 others			0
the incident has since been blamed primarily on the police for letting too many people enter the stadium and remains the worst stadium - related disaster in @entity289 history and one of the world 's worst football disasters			0
