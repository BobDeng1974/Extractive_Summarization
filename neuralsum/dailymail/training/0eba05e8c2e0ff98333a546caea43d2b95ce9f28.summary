@entity1 residents were bracing for a powerful storm expected to be the biggest in five years as a torrent of atmospheric moisture originating near @entity5 barreled toward the @entity6 wednesday			1
the @entity7 issued a high wind and flash flood warning for areas in and around the @entity11 and north up the western @entity13 coast			1
the storm was expected to pelt the region through thursday			1
it could overwhelm waterways and roadway drainage systems , possibly leading to flash flooding			0
this storm is ' expected to be one of the strongest storms in terms of wind and rain intensity ' since storms in october 2009 and january 2008 , respectively , said the @entity7 in @entity27			1
' pineapple express ' : an atmospheric river of moisture was expected on wednesday to bring a massive storm capable of dumping the most rain seen since 2005 on some areas of @entity1 lashing : the storm was expected to start lashing western @entity13 on down to the @entity11 on wednesday good and bad : flash flood warnings were issued by the state of @entity1 , but heavy snowfall was expected to benefit the state as forecasters said it would fall in areas hit hard by three years of drought heavy rainfall is expected , especially in the @entity45			1
according to @entity47 , @entity46 could see as much as six inches of rainfall in just a couple of days -- the most in that period of time since 2005			2
overall , the heaviest rainfall totals are expected from western @entity13 to @entity1 , with numerous 3 - to 5 - inch rainfall totals expected			1
@entity53 , the director of the @entity54 , issued a warning that the storm will present a risk of flash flooding and debris slides			2
' this year was also a significant fire season for @entity1 and @entity61 and burned areas are especially at risk for debris slides			2
even regions that do n't experience regular seasonal flooding could see flash flooding during this intense storm system , which could be the largest to date of this year 's rainy season , ' he said in a statement			1
high winds from 20 to 40 mph are expected , with gusts of 40 to 60 mph			2
authorities are warning motorists to avoid driving through standing water ; stay clear of outside roadway lanes , especially at night ; keep headlights on at all times ; and drive slowly to prevent hydroplaning			0

some projections said rainfall in @entity46 could reach levels not seen since a 2005 storm the so - called ' @entity88 ' is an atmospheric river of moisture that often brings major weather events to @entity93 's @entity92			1
the system is named for its origins in @entity5 , around where it gets its massive moisture content			0
@entity99 : @entity100 ( @entity101 ) are relatively narrow regions in the atmosphere that are responsible for most of the horizontal transport of water vapor outside of the tropics			0
while @entity107 come in many shapes and sizes , those that contain the largest amounts of water vapor , the strongest winds , and stall over watersheds vulnerable to flooding , can create extreme rainfall and floods			0
these events can disrupt travel , induce mud slides , and cause catastrophic damage to life and property			0
however , not all @entity107 cause damage â€“ most are weak , and simply provide beneficial rain or snow that is crucial to water supply			0
an average of between 30 to 50 percent of the total precipitation for the year on the @entity6 comes from @entity107			0
the biggest events among them can transport in the form of water vapor between 7.5 and 15 times the average flow of liquid water at the mouth of the mighty @entity136			0
how a typical @entity139 ' atmospheric river ' event works farther north , a series of strong weather fronts with high winds and heavy rains could lead to flooding and landslides this week in western @entity13			1
the @entity7 expects as much as 14 inches of rain between monday and thursday in the @entity148 west of @entity149			2
and it expects as much as 13 inches of rain in the @entity151 east of the city			2
saturated soils will bring the risk of mudslides , while winds could topple trees			0
last week , a different @entity92 system brought three days of rain to @entity61			1
there was some flooding and evacuations near hillsides stripped bare by wildfires , but the @entity166 area avoided major damage despite some huge rainfall totals			0
an exceptional 14.5 inches fell between tuesday and thursday at @entity169 in the @entity170 , the @entity7 said			0
most other parts of the state received 2 to 4 inches of rain			0
the storm dropped snow in mountains key to the state 's water supply and made signature waterfalls flow at @entity180 , including the 2,425 - foot @entity181 that had slowed to a trickle in @entity183			1
meanwhile , @entity61 was hit by a different storm system just a week before			1
that system hung around for days and caused mudslides in areas of @entity188 where wildfires had stripped vegetations @entity191 gets sprayed near @entity192 in @entity193 , @entity1 on december 2 when heavy rain from a powerful @entity92 storm swept through @entity61 , prompting both relief in the drought - stricken state but also concern about flooding and mudslides on denuded slopes			1

high wind and flash flood warnings have been issued from western @entity13 down to points south including the @entity11
the storm was expected to make *landfall* wednesday and deluge the region with rainfall exceeding 5 inches in some areas by thursday
just last week a days - long storm *walloped* drought - stricken @entity61 , which will experience this week 's storms last licks *friday* am
