@entity5 , an 11th - grader who lives in a suburb of @entity7 , @entity8 , had her school locker vandalized by bullies , who took her @entity11 and used it to post cruel messages on her @entity13			1
but rather than retaliate , the student decided to spread happiness instead , and came into school last week armed with 850 post-it notes covered in messages like ' you 're awesome ! ' and ' be yourself '			1
brave response : @entity5 , a @entity8 11th - grader , started her ' positive post-it ' campaign in response to being bullied love on the lockers : @entity5 had he locker broken into and cruel messages posted on her @entity13 - but responded by putting encouraging notes on other students ' lockers she stuck the messages the locker of every student at @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 , in the hope of making everybody smile			1
but she was swiftly disciplined by her teachers , who classified the notes as litter			2
@entity5 was pulled out of class , shouted at by staff and told that the school janitors are not there to clean up her mess , the @entity41 reported			1
yelled at : however , teachers disagreed with @entity5 's actions and told her off for putting up the notes her mother , @entity50 , told the paper : ' i do n't understand that when my kid is bullied , nothing happens , but when she tries to do something positive , she is punished			2
' @entity5 said she wrote and stuck up the notes to ' do something positive ' , and because bullying at her school is ' not necessarily addressed '			0
however , despite the reaction from school authorities , the wider community rallied round her and started spreading similar post-its around the town			0
fightback : however , other students rallied around @entity5 and gave her campaign extra momentum			0
