@entity0 might have seen their @entity1 dreams end in @entity3 on wednesday night , but they are the @entity5 's big winners this season in terms of money made from taking part in @entity11 's premier competition			1
defeat at the @entity12 left @entity14 's men with just the @entity5 title to fight for in what is looking increasingly like a disappointing season at the @entity18 , on the pitch at least			0
off it , @entity0 's staff will be delighted to be able to bring in £ 28.4million - worth of revenue from their participation in @entity11 , more than @entity25 and @entity26 - who both joined @entity0 in dropping out at this stage - and group stage flops @entity29			2
@entity0 captain @entity30 and his team - mates had a tough night in @entity3 on wednesday @entity25 were knocked out by @entity32 at the same stage as @entity0 but take home less money the reasoning behind @entity0 's increased income is their league positioning from last year , which affects the market pool shared between the clubs and accounts for half of the money paid to participating clubs			2
the @entity5 champions get 40 per cent of the money set aside for @entity48 sides , with @entity29 taking 30 per cent , @entity25 on 20 per cent and @entity26 getting just 10 per cent			1
the other half of money paid to clubs comes from prize money based on the stage they are knocked out at			0
given their third - place position in the @entity5 last year and having advanced to the second round with @entity0 and @entity26 , @entity25 are the second biggest earners on £ 28.4m			1
@entity59 is consoled after @entity26 's defeat to @entity61 - they earned the same amount as @entity29 @entity63 and his @entity29 team - mates topped up their earnings with a brief @entity67 flirtation group stage second round quarter - finals semi-finals runner - up winner £ 6.2million £ 2.5m ( £ 8.7m total ) £ 2.8m ( £ 11.5m total ) £ 3.5m ( £ 15m total ) £ 4.6m ( £ 19.6m total ) £ 7.5m ( £ 22.5m total ) figures exclude market pool share , clubs also earn £ 700,000 per group stage win and £ 350,000 per group stage draw @entity80 rivals @entity26 brought in the same level of revenue as @entity29 - £ 21.6m			1
this comes down to the @entity86 club 's better league position last season - second rather than fourth - plus the topping up of their total by £ 0.8m from a brief stint in the @entity67			0
come the final in @entity90 on june 6 , whoever lifts the famous trophy could pick up a prize pot approaching £ 26.8m , dependent on their group stage results , and that 's before the market pool money is considered			0
they also get the chance of another payday in the @entity102 next season , played between the @entity1 and @entity67 winners			2
that one - off game paid out £ 2.1m to this season 's victors , @entity105 .			0

@entity0 will be paid £ 28.4m for their @entity1 efforts
that is £ 3.8m more than their nearest @entity5 rivals , @entity25
@entity29 and @entity26 , also knocked out , both earn £ 21.6m from @entity102
the *difference* for @entity0 comes from their position as @entity48 champions
eventual winners of @entity1 could make around £ *40m*
