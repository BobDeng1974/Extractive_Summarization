by @entity0 away from human eyes , the deep ocean is a world of activity as colourful creatures sweep through icy waters in search of food			2
but take a closer look and you ’ll see a second community of critters – one that hides away in the darkness among rocks , corals and seaweed			0
with camouflage as their main defence , these creatures are masters of disguise , capable of transforming their colour and shape whenever danger lurks nearby			0
a pygmy seahorse is shown here blending in with the fan coral it lives on			1
the image was taken by @entity31 photographer @entity30 in @entity32			1
the area is known for having the best ' muck diving ' in the world @entity37 - based photographer , @entity30 , has been able to capture this incredible sea life in action during his recent visit to the @entity41 in @entity32			1
the area is well - known for something known as muck diving , which gets its name from the sediment that lies at the bottom of muck dive sites			1
‘ @entity49 can be characterised by the black sand and general bleakness of the seabed , ’ explained mr @entity30			2
a crinoid squat lobster , also known as feather star squat lobster or elegant squat lobster , is pictured here			1
these small crabs that live among the arms of crinoids , often taking on the colours of their host to camouflage themselves further from predators			0
during the day , they use this camouflage to hide among the arms or feet of the crinoid , before boldly walking the surface of the arms at night to feed a needle cuttlefish is almost perfectly camouflaged against the sand in this image			1
recent research has found that cuttlefish can assess the colour , contrast and even the texture of their surroundings and emulate within seconds in total darkness some creatures prefer to dress up to hide themselves from predators			2
the @entity83 crab , ( pictured ) for instance , disguises itself as algae by decorating its body with pieces of @entity83 algae ‘ it does n't look much , but it hides some of the weirdest critters you 'll find underwater			0
the occasional coral outcrops house some of the more colourful examples			0

another impressive master of disguise is the needle cuttlefish , which is almost perfectly camouflaged against the sand in @entity30 ’s image			1

candy crab or soft coral crab - @entity126 , shows similar colouring to the soft coral it lives on ( pictured right )			2
on the left , @entity131 or whip coral crab , also known as @entity133 , blends in with the whip coral @entity137 shrimp - @entity136 commensalis blending in with the coral			1

the area is renowned for something known as muck diving , which gets its name from the sediment that lies at the bottom of muck dive sites the octopus is another creature that can mislead its prey through changing its colour and appearance			1
among other ruses , the sea creature has been known to flatten out to appear as a poisonous sole , and change colours on on its arms to make them look like poisonous sea snakes			0
this picture shows an octopus defilippi disappearing against the sandy seabed whip coral shrimp - @entity163 , camouflages itself against the whip coral			1
often if a divers hand is near to cleaner shrimps , they will attach themselves and start cleaning it some creatures prefer to dress up to hide themselves from predators			0
the @entity83 crab , for instance , disguises itself as algae by decorating its body with pieces of @entity83 algae			0
but the octopus is perhaps one of the most talented in misleading its prey through changing its colour and appearance			0

@entity30 was also able to capture the @entity83 ghost pipefish			2
its disguise is so precise that it even mimics the white dead patches on the plant that it hides itself against			0
‘ the pygmy seahorse is being a particular favourite of mine , and only about 2cm big , ’ said @entity30			1
the pygmy seahorse blends in so well that it was only discovered by humans in 1969 after showing up with corals in an aquarium			2
@entity30 was able to capture the @entity83 ghost pipefish			2
its disguise is so precise that it even mimics the white dead patches on the plant that it hides itself against robust ghost pipefish , also known as , @entity210 is captured in this image			0
this cryptic species looks very similar to a drifting piece of seagrass ' @entity49 can be characterised by the black sand and general bleakness of the seabed , ' said mr @entity30			2
' it does n't look much , but hides some of the weirdest critters you 'll find underwater			0
' pictured is the devil scorpionfish - @entity224 didactylus , well camouflaged against the seabed painted frogfish - @entity227 pictus , displays identical colouring to the sponge it rests against			1
the painted frogfish is a resident of the @entity234 and is found on coral reefs and among debris on open sand or mud flats			1

images were taken by @entity37 - based photographer , @entity30 , during his visit to the @entity41 in @entity32
the area is well - known for muck diving , which *allowed* @entity30 to get close to the underwater creatures
one *highlight* is the mysterious pygmy seahorse that is shown blending in with the fan coral it lives on
other creatures *include* a crinoid squat lobster , needle cuttlefish , *xenia* shrimp , an octopus and a painted frogfish
