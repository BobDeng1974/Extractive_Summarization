by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 and @entity2 follow @ @ oliver_todd @entity3 has raised question marks over @entity6 ’s shock move to @entity7 , but @entity8 insisted that the former @entity10 man would be welcome back at @entity11			1
the 36 - year - old will join the @entity14 champions on loan until january as he looks to maintain his fitness ahead of next year ’s @entity18 season			1
@entity6 has signed a two - year contract with emerging @entity18 side @entity20 , but the club do not enter the @entity23 league until march 2015			1
the company also have a minority share holding in @entity37 club @entity36			1
@entity6 could be important to @entity38 in the @entity39 given he counts as a homegrown player			1
city must include five homegrown players in a restricted 21 - man squad in the competition after they failed @entity45 ’s @entity25 test			2
and @entity3 , whose side face @entity7 in the @entity49 at @entity50 on sunday , admitted : ‘ @entity6 ’s move to @entity7 is a surprise as after the statements we heard , it looks like all these “ @entity7 ” clubs will feed the main club			1
welcome : @entity6 left @entity10 this summer after 13 years at the club and will remain a club legend no problem : @entity8 refused to complain about the move , saying @entity6 was free to join who he liked ‘ i heard they want to buy five clubs all around the world			1
i do n’t know the rules well enough			1
‘ they bought the @entity27 franchise for $ 100m in the @entity68 to play next season and at moment the players they sign can not play until next year			2
‘ they will register in the clubs where they will put them and they can get out on loan			0
is it a way to get around ( financial ) fair play ? i do n’t know			2
he added : ‘ would @entity79 do that ? we are happy to dedicate the money we make just to run our club as there is not a lot of surplus to buy other clubs			0
’ however @entity10 manager @entity8 said he had no hard feelings towards the club legend , and that he was welcome to join any club			1
partnership : @entity27 , where @entity6 has signed , are owned by @entity34 ‘ he is a free agent he can choose his club so i have no problem at all , ’ @entity8 said			1
‘ when he comes to @entity11 he is welcome			1
when he comes to the @entity94 …			0
he is at the @entity94			0
’ meanwhile , @entity97 is unwilling to sign a new contract at @entity79 , edging him a step closer to the exit door			0
the @entity103 captain ’s contract expires at the end of the forthcoming season and the club had been keen on offering him fresh terms			2
but the @entity109 international does not want to open talks about extending his contract			0
time to go ? @entity79 captain @entity97 looks to be on the verge of leaving the club @entity114 could go - @entity3 unless @entity79 sell him in the current transfer window , it means the central - defender can sign a pre-contract agreement with an overseas side from january			1
@entity79 do not want to sell their captain this summer , but also want to avoid the possibility of losing him for nothing next year			0
@entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 all have a firm interest in @entity128			0
@entity79 would prefer to sell @entity97 abroad rather than to @entity125 , which will prove a difficult stumbling block to overcome for @entity130			0
the @entity103 snubbed an initial £ 7million enquiry from @entity125 earlier this summer			0
success : @entity97 captained @entity79 to the @entity134 last season , ending their nine - year trophy drought and with @entity79 expecting @entity124 to make their move for @entity97 in the coming days , the @entity137 ’s future could come to a head sooner rather than later			2
@entity97 missed sunday ’s 1 - 0 @entity141 defeat to @entity142 with a hamstring injury , and it seems unlikely that he will play for the club until his immediate future is resolved			0
midfielder @entity147 is also being managed through a hip complaint			2
@entity149 scored the winner for the @entity152 club at the @entity94 on sunday .			0

@entity6 joined @entity20 after leaving @entity10 on a free
midfielder has been loaned to @entity7 before season starts
@entity7 , @entity20 and @entity33 are all owned by holding company @entity34
@entity3 questions the deal but admits ' i do n’t know the rules well enough '
@entity8 *claims* @entity6 will be welcome when he returns to @entity11
