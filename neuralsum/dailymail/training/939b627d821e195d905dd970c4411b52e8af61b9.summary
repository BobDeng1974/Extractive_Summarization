by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 ’s controversial former spin doctor @entity2 had a drunken one - night stand with a labour minister , it was claimed			1
friends of mr @entity2 , whose blockbuster memoirs have revealed the political back - stabbings and chaos in mr @entity3 ’s @entity12 regime , say he had sex with the woman after a booze - fuelled party			1
the raucous event was attended by @entity18 mandarins and @entity20 aides close to mr @entity3 , including figures with close links to @entity23			1
after it ended , mr @entity2 spent the night at the woman ’s home			1
critics will claim that this latest allegation underlines the public interest in the amoral political world in which mr @entity3 ’s spin doctor operated the party took place at the peak of mr @entity3 ’s power when the woman involved was an influential @entity20 figure			1
she also served as a labour minister			2
mr @entity2 has declined to comment on the claim			1
a source close to the woman – whom @entity42 has decided not to name – confirmed mr @entity2 spent the night at her house , but said he did so only because he was ‘ too drunk to go home ’			1
the source vehemently denied the couple had sex			1
a friend of mr @entity2 said the spin doctor had told those close to him that he had sex with a well - known @entity20 figure , whom he named			1
‘ he said he had been to a party , there was a lot of drinking and they ended up in bed together having sex , ’ said the friend			2
the claim adds a shocking new dimension to the @entity64 scandal with more explosive revelations expected when the book is published this week			1
critics will claim that this latest allegation underlines the public interest in the amoral political world in which mr @entity3 ’s spin doctor operated			1
mr @entity23 ’s aides further fear the book could wreck the @entity20 conference , which opens in @entity75 tomorrow			1
in a separate development , ‘ bullying ’ mr @entity3 is today attacked by former labour cabinet minister @entity78 , who is not the woman in the alleged @entity64 sex romp			1
she called on mr @entity3 to disown mr @entity2 – dubbed @entity82 for his damaging briefings – and said she did not believe claims that the former prime minister had nothing to do with his actions			1
ms @entity78 , who confronted mr @entity3 after a member of his team smeared her , said he must shoulder the blame for mr @entity2 ’s ‘ disgusting and corrupt ’ conduct			1
‘ there was a corrupt culture which had nothing to do with serving the @entity97 people but was about personal ambition , ’ she said in an interview with @entity42			0
‘ i feel sickened it was not just tolerated but encouraged at the heart of government			0
@entity3 is not an innocent , it is inconceivable he did not know what @entity2 was doing			1
' in the absence of a very clear statement by @entity3 that he did n’t know about it , it damages his reputation			0
’ mr @entity23 's aides further fear the book could wreck the @entity20 conference , which opens in @entity75 tomorrow the latest extracts from mr @entity2 ’s book also claim that mr @entity23 sent potentially damaging emails to a party official plotting to discredit opponents			1
the second instalment of the memoir , published in the @entity118 yesterday , suggested that the @entity20 leader might ‘ have problems ’ if his exchanges with party insider @entity120 – who conspired with mr @entity2 to smear political rivals – ever emerged			1
@entity20 yesterday flatly denied the claim , saying mr @entity23 was not involved in any plan to smear or spread lies about opponents and had no recollection about any emails			1
a spokesman added that mr @entity23 had told @entity3 in september 2008 he was concerned about mr @entity2 ’s activities and disapproved of them			1
mr @entity2 ’s book also alleges that mr @entity23 ’s inner circle was behind anonymous attacks on @entity135 , and concludes that mr @entity23 ‘ clearly inherited all the ruthless genes in that family ’			1
other extracts include the revelation that mr @entity3 discussed the possibility of putting troops on to the streets as the 2008 banking crisis grew			2
they also detailed how @entity145 had sent mr @entity3 a furious @entity147 card after mr @entity3 accused mr @entity145 of using his children as ‘ props ’ , and how a senior official broke down in tears as mr @entity3 told mr @entity2 to leak secret details of the @entity154 budget			1
meanwhile shadow foreign secretary @entity155 denied claims by mr @entity2 that he knifed his politician sister , @entity157 , by telling mr @entity3 ‘ that she had to quit ’ following a row about donations to her @entity20 leadership campaign			1
mr @entity155 said : ‘ i always supported my sister and i never supported @entity2			1
that might explain why he writes about me in those terms			0
he was discredited when he left @entity12			0
the politics he embodied has been completely discredited and thankfully the @entity168 has moved on			0
’ he added that ‘ lying ’ was ‘ what @entity2 does ’			1
yesterday ’s extracts revealed for the first time the extent of mr @entity2 ’s drinking			1
he told how he had enjoyed a ‘ cracker ’ of a 35th birthday in 2005 , when he combined afternoon drinking with briefings to journalists in which he claimed that mr @entity3 had put ‘ lead in @entity180 ’s pencil ’ over @entity154 negotiations			2
he fell asleep on the sofa and woke up at midday the next day to find he had 26 missed calls , including several from a furious mr @entity3 – who had been bawled by mr @entity180 over the newspaper stories			0
it came as @entity135 admitted for the first time that he had been part of a ‘ macho ’ gang around mr @entity3			0
he said : ‘ we were young and inexperienced			0
it was a mistake and it was damaging to the government			0
’ @entity2 had two nicknames , ' @entity196 ' and ' @entity197 '			1
only the latter was accurate			0
he was , and still is , a very sophisticated political operator			0
by @entity201 @entity200 i could have been @entity203 was looking for a new communications adviser , i was asked by two @entity3 allies if i wanted the job			0
but as is the way of @entity208 , i never heard anything again and @entity2 moved into position			1
@entity3 made the right call			0
i was a spin - chorister compared to @entity2			1
as the storm over his new book has revealed , few political advisors have inspired such fear and loathing			0
by @entity2 ’s own admission , anything and anyone was fair game			1
his only rule ? there were no rules			0
@entity2 is @entity20 ’s @entity224 , the almost supernaturally evil villain from the film @entity227			1
six years after he vanished from frontline politics , many still fear the hand of @entity64 reaching out in the night and inflicting some terrible vengeance			1
although a neat analogy , @entity2 is not one of the usual suspects			2
contrary to the popular impression of him as a @entity237 hatchet - man , he has a fearsome intellect			0
an alumnus of @entity240 , @entity241 , he is a much - prized member of the teams at the pub quizzes he loves to frequent			0
@entity2 had two nicknames , ‘ @entity196 ’ and ‘ @entity82 ’			2
only the latter was accurate			0
he was , and still is , a very sophisticated political operator			0
and as one of his @entity249 foes has grudgingly conceded , @entity2 was persistent , and ruthless , in pursuit of his prey			2
‘ he practised methodical destruction , ’ he said			0
one of the reasons for this is that @entity2 was not a political activist , but a career civil servant			2
he worked in the @entity258 , where he was spotted by @entity3 , who made him his personal press aide			0
over the past few days a number of people have condemned his ‘ disloyalty ’ to @entity20			2
but he was a @entity3 man , not a @entity20 man			2
those saying @entity2 would have nothing if it was n’t for the party miss the point			2
he believes he ’d have nothing if it was n’t for @entity3			0
he also enjoys a drink , and a karaoke mike			0
after a hard day in the @entity258 he could often be spotted holding court in a @entity274 drinking den. although not a founder member , @entity2 ’s hard - carousing ways quickly earned him acceptance into the notoriously tightly - knit @entity3 inner circle			1
‘ it ’s just what we @entity283 are like , ’ one of @entity2 ’s friends told me			1
‘ we ’re not @entity249 , with their fine wines and dinner parties			0
we like a curry and a sing - song			0
’ fatefully , so did @entity2			2
he was also able to expand @entity3 ’s circle of press contacts			0
‘ @entity2 loved political gossip and process , ’ said another friend			2
‘ he ’d sit there and tell you the most outrageous things , then say , ‘ ‘ of course , that ’s all off the record ’ ’			0
’ he found the rigid strictures of the civil service machine frustrating , and revelled in the freedom to brief openly			0
‘ i think that was part of the problem , ’ said one @entity20 insider			2
‘ he ’d been sitting there kicking his heels at the @entity258 , then along came @entity3 and suddenly he was part of this alpha - male , all - lads - together culture			0
it was like the leash had been taken off			0
’ @entity2 ’s critics view the publication of his diaries as an act of supreme selfishness			2
but he has been told via intermediaries there ’s no prospect of a return to @entity20 ’s inner circle while @entity23 is leader			2
the book has also created further tensions in his now - strained relationship with @entity3 himself			0
i could never really have been @entity2			2
i ’m not tough enough , ruthless enough , or sophisticated enough			0
plus , i ’m rubbish at karaoke			0
