' ‘ that ’s to punish you , to protect others and to demonstrate that domestic violence is not acceptable			2
' ‘ there is no distinction between it being a man on a woman or a woman on a man			0
all domestic violence has to be taken very seriously			0
' ‘ your wrongdoing falls into the most serious category of offending			0
' ‘ this was a sustained attack upon your boyfriend with a knife in which you stabbed him a number of times			2
' ‘ as he said in his statement , you were out of control and your eyes were like fireballs			0

judge @entity100 warned @entity8 : ‘ the risk of you offending is so high in relation to serious offences that you do qualify for an indeterminate sentence			1
