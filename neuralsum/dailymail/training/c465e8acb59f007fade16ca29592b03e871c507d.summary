so , too , did writers @entity3 and @entity4 ( @entity5			1
the artist who created @entity7 swore by his , and spent half an hour inside it at least once a day			1
they were all devotees of the original love machine , invented in the @entity11 by psycho - analyst and therapist dr @entity12 as a pathway to a better , if not the best ever , sexual experience			1
box of delights : @entity12 's @entity18 in some ways , you ca n't help feeling sorry for @entity21 - born @entity12 — a disciple of @entity22 in @entity23 — who escaped from @entity24 to the @entity25 just before @entity26 there he was , a prophet for the health - giving power of the guilt - free sexual climax			1
he coined the phrase ' sexual revolution ' and devoted his life as a psycho - analyst to freeing us all from our repressive @entity38 selves			1
then , on the verge of the @entity40 , with society about to hitch up its skirts and go sex mad , he died , and missed out on the supposed pleasure of his own @entity45			1
but his invention — later spoofed in a @entity48 film as an ' @entity49 ' — lived on , with its promise of delivering what he called ' orgastic potency ' , despite being little more than a plain wooden cupboard lined with metal			1
no wheels , no whistles , no ticklers or teasers , no bells			1
it was just a box			1
yet , according to author @entity62 in a new biography of @entity12 , @entity61 had one at the height of his @entity0 fame			1
but whether sitting in the box delivered what its designer promised is another matter			1
if @entity71 was shaken or stirred , he never said			1
@entity72 , author of the original @entity7 comic book , revealed his gave him ' an inner vibration , a little bit like an orgasmic feeling ' — which is a long way from blowing your socks off			2
@entity25 author @entity79 , who desperately searched for what he called the ' apocalyptic ' sexual experience , admitted just before he died that he never achieved it with his version			1
they tried it : actor @entity61 , left , and , right , author @entity79 perhaps they were all just bonkers , you may think			1
but there was method — of a sort — in @entity12 's madness			2
more importantly , his theories had a lasting impact on our society , and not for the better			2
there is a direct link from his sanctification of free love and instant sex to the excesses of today 's permissive society			2
at the beginning , however , @entity12 was a star turn in developing the discipline of psycho - analysis in the early years of the 20th century			1
as a shrink , he believed people needed to be freed from their inhibitions			2
but then he went out on a limb of his own with a radical theory			2
the release that came with sexual climax , he declared , was the key to a healthy mind and healthy body — and , indeed , as the scope of his vision expanded , to a healthy world			1
it would not only cure neurotics of their fears , but war - mongering fascists of their odious beliefs			1
' @entity129 ' was his belief long before it became a @entity133 slogan			2
but his ambition did n't stop there			2
@entity12 was convinced he had discovered the very essence of life , a universal and eternal force that he named ' orgone ' — hence the official name of his wooden box : the ' @entity18 '			2
spoof : @entity48 is hauled from the @entity49 in his film @entity143 @entity18 was not unlike the concept of the ' libido ' his old teacher @entity22 had identified — except @entity12 insisted his life force had a physical presence , which manifested itself in glowing microscopic particles of matter he called ' bions '			1
it was the physical harvesting and harnessing of ' orgone ' from the atmosphere that was the purpose of his sex machine — which was best used , he said , in direct sunlight , in open country and well away from electricity power lines			2
the wood in its construction absorbed the free - flying ' orgone ' from the skies , while layers of metal kept it insulated inside			1
by concentrating the life force in this ' accumulator ' , he claimed , its users were charged up , much like a car battery plugged into the mains , and then experienced the sexual ecstasy that would free their minds and bodies			1
that the box heated up , he claimed , was proof of its ability to attract natural energy			2
sceptics , however , suggested that confining someone inside an insulated container on a hot day was bound to lead to raised temperatures , but not necessarily anything else			2
the potential of his contraption was , he maintained , limitless			2
it could heal the sick and even eliminate cancer tumours			2
it was the panacea the world had been waiting for			2
' i am the discoverer of life energy , ' he maintained confidently			0
so convinced was he that he challenged @entity193 , the world 's greatest theoretical physicist , to experiment with an accumulator and endorse his discovery			0
the great man examined the evidence and dismissed @entity12 's theory as scientific nonsense			0
' @entity18 ' , he declared , simply did not exist			0
thereafter he refused to take @entity12 's calls or discuss the matter			0
slighted , rejected as a quack by the international psycho - analysis community and as a charlatan by the scientific one , @entity12 became increasingly paranoid			1
everyone became a suspected enemy , even his ex-wife and daughter			0
having become a virtual recluse at his home in @entity214 , he got on with building his accumulators — 250 in all — for a small number of thrill - seekers			1
most were members of the emerging beat generation of writers and artists , attracted by his unconventionality and his endorsement of free love			0
but then he fell foul of the law			0
the cures he claimed for his accumulator were judged by the @entity229 to be false and misleading , and a court injunction ordered him to stop selling and distributing them			0
when he ignored the ban , he was jailed for two years in 1956 and his remaining machines destroyed			0
piles of his books were burned by the authorities , an echo of what the @entity238 had done to his work			0
his supporters suspected a conspiracy to silence him because of the subversive nature of his ideas			0
he died in prison , from a heart attack , in november 1957			0
his legacy , the love machine , ended up in a @entity249 , alongside a foot - operated breast enlarger and a vacuum - powered hair restorer			1
but it took on a new life in popular culture			0
it inspired @entity258 's ecstasy as she was tucked up inside a so - called ' @entity259 ' in the 1964 cult sci - fi parody @entity261 , and put the smile on @entity48 's face after he stepped out of an ' @entity49 ' in @entity264 ( 1973 )			1
it was @entity267 's ' big , bright green pleasure machine '			0
barbarella : @entity258 plays the eponymous heroine , trapped in the so - called @entity259 but @entity12 's cultural impact went far deeper than jokey slots in films and songs			1
in many ways , it was his endorsement of sexual release that put the swinging into the @entity40			1
@entity278 was good , restraint was bad			0
our permissive , sex - saturated century has its origins in @entity12 's so - called science			1
it was not meant to work out like this , of course			0
according to his theories , once the shackles were off , the world would be a better place			0
it has n't proved true			0
in an article analysing @entity12 , @entity292 concluded that @entity25 was one giant ' orgone ' box			0
' from innumerable screens and stages , posters and pages , it flashes larger - than - life - sized images of sex			1
the message is sex will save you			0
' astonishingly , that description was of 1964 , an era that now looks positively quaint			0
in the 47 years since then , all semblance of restraint seems to have been abandoned			0
two conflicting interpretations flowed from @entity12 's love contraption			0
' to the bohemians , ' says his biographer , @entity62 , ' it was a liberation machine , the wardrobe that would lead to @entity45			0
but to conservatives it was @entity319 , out of which escaped anarchism and promiscuous sex			0
' there , if you 'll forgive the expression , is the rub			0
and how has it turned out ? in a @entity329 documentary on @entity12 earlier this year , @entity327 was asked about the influence of his theories on @entity332 , her ground - breaking 1970 book about women 's liberation			1
' we did think freeing sexuality would allow virtue to flower , ' she said			0
' we were wrong , i think			0
' her words could serve as @entity12 's requiem , carved on one of his orgasmatrons and , along with the legacy of the @entity40 he inspired , laid to rest .			0

the ' @entity49 ' - used by @entity61 and @entity79 - promised sexual highs
