by @entity0 it is often said that the past is a foreign country - but in these vibrant images it comes one step closer to reality			1
the original scenes they show - captured only in black and white at the time due to technological restraints - have been reimagined and given new life			1
these coloured scenes were created from original archive photographs by artist @entity13			1
some , such as @entity14 , @entity15 and the famous crash of the @entity17 in 1936 are instantly recognisable , while others , such as portraits of @entity20 and @entity21 , give a new perspective on some of the best - known figures of past centuries			2
the images were coloured , using digital techniques , by mr @entity13 , 27 , who lives in @entity27			2
the images can take anywhere from a few hours to straightforward shots to days for more complicated scenes			0
class in colour : film star and style icon @entity15 is pictured in her kitchen preparing breakfast in the original to the left , and again to the right in detailed colour catastrophe : the @entity17 , an airship filled with flammable hydrogen , is pictured in an iconic photograph to the left crashing in flames on may 6 1937 - but the flames look even more vivid in the coloured version to the right genius move : artist @entity13 spends hours - sometimes days - painstakingly adding colour to the old images , such as this 1921 picture of physicist @entity14 he said : ' the addition of colour can help connect people to history			1
with black and white photos , people tend to feel distant and disconnected from the real and vibrant world those photos are actually portraying			0
' by adding color to these photos , it makes them seem more familiar , and the viewer is brought a little closer to the reality in which they were taken			0
' what i do want to make clear , however , is that colorizations are done out of a respect and reverence for history			0
they are not meant to be replacements - the originals are still here for us all to see and enjoy and preserve for the future			0
' relic of art : @entity78 is pictured above in @entity79 , next to a panel of his famous water lilies series coloured in : the representation of the works , which now sell for millions and are displayed the world over , has been rendered more vividly in colour @entity87 : the photograph , left , of @entity20 in an unusually relaxed pose - as he receives news of @entity91 territory expanding - looks even more human thanks to colour			2
ms @entity93 says her process makes pictures ' seem more familiar ' flying ace : baron captain @entity97 , pictured left in 1917 , was better - known as the @entity98			0
the @entity100 fighter pilot can be seen with more sharpness and detail too in the coloured version legendary pilot : continuing the aerial theme , mr @entity13 also coloured a photograph of @entity107 , the first man to fly non-stop across the @entity108 in an areoplane dustbowl : the above black - and - white photograph of an @entity112 farmboy came to symbolise the effects of the @entity114 , - and looks even more arid and bleak in colour a look of one 's own : author @entity21 , left in the 1902 original , is another of the historic figures who has benefited from ms @entity93 's treatments neverland : @entity125 author @entity124 is pictured above in a drawing , which was then reimagined as a photograph with much smoother detail native land : this 1908 images show a @entity133 chief - @entity131 - on horseback in @entity134 beauty : the vast wilderness of @entity131 's land is easier to see and appreciate when the sepia tones of the original are removed a song of himself : @entity142 , the revered @entity143 poet , died before the turn of the @entity145 , but is imagined above in colour from an 1887 portrait criminal : bound in wrist irons , would - be assassin @entity151 , a @entity152 soldier in the @entity143 civil war , strikes a chilling figure in his coloured 1865 mugshot , taken after he was captured for attempting to kill a @entity143 secretary of state @entity158 project : ms @entity93 has also coloured this portrait of groundbreaking @entity161 physicist @entity160 , who won a @entity158 prize			1
