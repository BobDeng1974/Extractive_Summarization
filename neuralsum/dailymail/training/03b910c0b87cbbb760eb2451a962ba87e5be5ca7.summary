by @entity0 published : 07:47 est , 4 january 2013 updated : 09:14 est , 4 january 2013 a potential cause of miscarriages has been identified by scientists - a breakthrough that could lead to the development of new drugs that prevent them			1
laboratory tests showed women who had lost three or more babies had high levels of a molecule known as @entity13 - 33 in their womb cells			1
medicine to target the protein could be given to pregnant women who are particularly vulnerable			1
tests found that women who had suffered successive miscarriages had high levels of a certain molecule in their womb cells the researchers said the molecule controls whether embryos are accepted by the womb			1
but women who had suffered multiple miscarriages continued to secrete it for an extra ten days , they found			2
the receptivity of the womb was not being controlled properly in these women , according to the findings published in the journal @entity35			2
dr @entity36 , of @entity37 , said : ' our study suggests in women who have had successive miscarriages , the mechanisms that control whether the womb can accept and support an embryo do n't work properly			1
' this might mean they can become pregnant with poor quality embryos or the embryo implants in an unsupportive environment , which would seriously compromise the chances of a successful pregnancy			2
' healthy embryo : a prolonged window of fertility increases the risk of abnormal embryos implanting the study also looked at the effects of these molecular signals on fertility in mice			0
the researchers treated the uteruses of the mice with chemicals secreted by cells from the human womb lining			0
they found chemicals produced by cells from women with repeated miscarriages extended the time during which mice could become pregnant , but also made miscarriages more likely			1
the researchers conclude a prolonged window of fertility increases the risk of abnormal embryos implanting			0
in addition , it is associated with inflammation in the lining of the womb , which compromises the development of healthy embryos			0
study co-author professor @entity84 , of the @entity85 , said : ' the molecular signals we identified are known to be involved in a range of diseases including @entity90 , asthma and heart disease			0
' our findings suggest targeting these molecules might also be a promising strategy for developing treatments that would prevent miscarriages in women who are especially vulnerable			2
' at the start of pregnancy , the fertilised embryo must embed itself in the lining of the womb which is only receptive for a few days in each menstrual cycle , ensuring they can only implant at the right stage of development			0
currently , scientists know only a few details about the biological processes that control when an embryo can be implanted			0
cells secrete @entity13 - 33 during the receptive phase which influences the activityof nearby cells			1
normally , the effects are shortlived , which helps to ensure women can only conceive during a narrow window .			0
