for @entity1 , cups have a tendency to turn into poisoned chalices			0
but in a lengthy roll of dishonour in knockout competitions during his time at the helm at @entity12 , this defeat against @entity5 last night was just about as bad as it has ever been for the beleaguered @entity14 boss			1
as @entity5 celebrated their first - ever win over @entity12 in their history , the theme tune from the @entity16 blared out across the @entity18			1
to widespread astonishment , the plucky part - timers had come back from the dead : 2 - 0 down to win 3 - 2 and reach the final of the @entity24			1
but having presided over the most unlikely transformation since @entity26 and co entered a shed armed with a couple of pipe cleaners and some bolts only to emerge with a fully kitted out armoured car , the sad truth for @entity12 here was that they had actually just lost to @entity5 's @entity35			1
@entity5 's @entity36 ( left ) celebrates scoring the equaliser in the second half against @entity12 @entity5 players celebrate an incredible comeback victory against @entity12 to reach the @entity24 final @entity42 ( right ) was the man who hit the winner with a minute left to play in the game for @entity5 @entity5 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity45 ; @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 ; @entity50 ( @entity51 69 ) , @entity52 , @entity36 , @entity53 ; @entity42 , @entity54			1
subs not used : @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 booked : @entity47 @entity12 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity60 ; @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 ; @entity65 ( @entity66 81 ) , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 ( @entity70 12 ) ; @entity71 ( @entity72 68 ) , @entity73			1
subs not used : @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 booked : @entity63 , @entity66 , @entity64 referee : @entity80 attendance : 2,443 @entity82 : @entity42 in the grip of a full - blown injury crisis , @entity5 boss @entity83 had been without eight key players : @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity56 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93			1
he could only fill five of the seven places on his bench			0
indeed he wondered aloud at one point if he could field a team			0
' any more injuries and i think i might get a game , ' sighed @entity102 chairman @entity101 before kick - off			2
but still they beat a @entity12 side who plumbed fresh depths at the @entity108 despite taking what looked an unassailable lead thanks to goals from @entity73 and @entity70			1
but two goals in 120 seconds from @entity42 and then @entity36 had @entity5 level , quite astonishingly			1
a fine winner from @entity42 merely left the @entity14 players , management staff and fans floored			2
@entity42 had set up the winner for @entity119 for @entity120 in the @entity24 against @entity12 earlier this year			1
@entity1 had rated that as his lowest moment on the park during his side 's climb up the leagues but last night 's loss will surely rival it			0
and on a dark night for @entity12 , @entity1 also suffered the added ignominy of losing his best player this season , @entity69 , to what looked a nasty hamstring injury			2
he now faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines			0
while @entity5 struggled to field a fit team , @entity1 , by stark contrast , had big - earners like @entity72 , @entity66 , and @entity70 among his substitutes			1
@entity72 's position on the bench was due to @entity1 promoting @entity71 back into his starting line - up after dropping him for the last two matches			0
@entity71 , of course , netted against former club @entity144 within 90 seconds of coming on as a substitute in the 3 - 0 @entity147 win on sunday			1
@entity73 ( centre ) scores to give @entity12 the lead against @entity5 in the second half @entity73 ( right ) celebrates with his team after @entity12 had taken the lead in the 49th minute @entity70 ( centre ) celebrates putting @entity12 2 - 0 up but it all went downhill for them after that but @entity5 could have been 3 - 0 up at half time			1
@entity42 missed a terrific chance when he miskicked in front of goal after a clever freekick was knocked down by @entity48			2
then @entity161 , on his full debut , hit a 25 - yarder that skidded past @entity60 's left post after @entity73 was robbed in possession			0
the best @entity12 could muster in the early stages was a @entity67 shot from distance that posed no trouble to @entity45 and an @entity68 shot that struck @entity71 on the back			2
then @entity60 had to run to the edge of his box to rescue @entity62 after the big defender misjudged a lofted through ball towards @entity36			0
then the normally deadly @entity54 squandered a great chance from ten yards , shanking wide with just @entity60 to beat			0
in just 45 minutes , @entity5 had created three more chances than @entity144 mustered on sunday at @entity14			2
@entity5 's @entity46 ( left ) challenges @entity62 ( centre ) of @entity12 for possession of the ball this was not at all going to plan for @entity1 and his players but they emerged from what was surely a rollicking and were a different outfit after the break			1
at the start , at least			0
the @entity14 side was ahead on 49 minutes when @entity71 's freekick was saved by @entity45 and @entity73 was there to fire the loose ball home from ten yards			2
@entity61 then forced a fine save from @entity45 , but a second goal arrived when @entity68 found @entity73 , who set up @entity191 to curl a low shot beyond @entity45 from the edge of the area			0
@entity195 over , @entity12 were on easy street			2
but two goals in two sensational minutes utterly changed all that			2
first , @entity52 chipped the ball back in and @entity42 headed into the net			0
then substitute @entity51 set up the outstanding @entity36 for an unlikely leveller to leave @entity12 stunned			0
@entity1 is falling under further pressure as @entity12 manager after his semi-final defeat @entity5 keeper @entity45 saved spectacularly from substitute @entity72 before @entity206 set up @entity42 for a fabulous winner			1
the part - timers now faces @entity209 in the final next april , dreaming of winning the cup for the first time since 1999			0
@entity83 danced in the home dugout like @entity213 , the @entity5 boss loves it when a plan comes together			0
he can claim this was no fluke			0
three times this season his side has faced @entity12 and they are yet to lose â€“ drawing 1 - 1 home and away in the @entity221			1
for @entity1 , however , after this latest sting in the tail from the @entity102 , the coming days will surely see the @entity14 legend face fresh calls for his head in a season that also sees them trail @entity229 in the league by nine points .			0

@entity12 took a 2 - 0 lead at @entity5 and appeared to have the game safe
but two goals in two minutes in the second half *hauled* @entity5 level
@entity42 then side *footed* in on 89 minutes to complete the comeback
