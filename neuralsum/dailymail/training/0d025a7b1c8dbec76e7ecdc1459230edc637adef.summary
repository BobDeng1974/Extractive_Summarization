by @entity0 published : 13:07 est , 21 november 2012 updated : 13:07 est , 21 november 2012 time is running out in the race to cut greenhouse gas emissions fast enough to keep global temperatures rises below @entity6 this century , the @entity1 warns			1
greenhouse gases are being pumped into the atmosphere in such quantities that temperatures are likely to rise at least 3c and up to @entity11 by 2100 even if government pledges for are kept			2
governments must promise and put into action many more measures than they have already committed to if the world is to keep temperatures rises below @entity6 , scientists and @entity1 officials said			1
wind farms offer renewable energy which can cut emissions but are often unpopular to do so , an international team of scientists said , annual greenhouse gas emissions must be slashed from about 50 gigatonnes ( @entity26 ) today to about @entity27 by 2020			1
however , emissions are still rising – they have risen 20 per cent since 2000 – and the report by the @entity30 forecasts they will be at about @entity32 by the end of the decade			1
this would leave an ‘ emissions gap ’ estimated to be @entity41 and even if government ’s delivered the most ambitious of their pledges the gap would still be @entity39			1
the gap is 2gt worse than last year 's forecast			2
@entity44 , @entity1 under - secretary general and @entity30 executive director , said : ‘ the sobering fact remains that a transition to a low carbon , inclusive @entity48 is happening far too slowly and the opportunity for meeting the @entity53 target is narrowing annually			2
‘ while governments work to negotiate a new international climate agreement to come into effect in 2020 , they urgently need to put their foot firmly on the action pedal by fulfilling financial , technology transfer and other commitments under the @entity1 climate convention treaties			2
‘ there are also a wide range of complementary voluntary measures that can that can bridge the gap between ambition and reality now rather than later			2
’ but he remains confident that temperatures can be kept down if there is the political will and that the technical capability exists			0
he added : ‘ there are many inspiring actions taking place at the national level on energy efficiency in buildings , investing in forests to avoid emissions linked with deforestation and new vehicle emissions standards alongside a remarkable growth in investment in new renewable energies worldwide , which in 2011 totaled close to us $ 260 billion			0
’ countries with emission - cut pledges in dark green , draft pledges in light green , no pledges in the palest shade @entity94 , executive secretary of the @entity95 , said : ‘ this report is a reminder that time is running out , but that the technical means and the policy tools to allow the world to stay below a maximum 2 degrees @entity102 are still available to governments and societies			0
‘ governments meeting in @entity106 for @entity107 now need to urgently implement existing decisions which will allow for a swifter transition towards a low - carbon and resilient world			0
‘ governments need to urgently identify how ambition can be raised			0
’ @entity114 described the publication of the report as a ‘ stark warning ’ that action needs to be taken urgently			0
@entity30 is confident that @entity119 of greenhouse gas emissions can be cut by 2020 estimated emissions through energy efficiency : @entity123 , from the campaign group , said : ‘ this report is a stark warning that can not be ignored - nations must take urgent and comprehensive action to slash emissions to avert a climate disaster			1
‘ the clock is ticking but there ’s still time to act - countries meeting in @entity106 next week must agree a clear course of action to tackle climate change before it is too late			0
‘ current @entity138 plans are hopelessly inadequate – its proposals to cut emissions by 20 per cent of 1990 levels have already been met			1
‘ developed nations like @entity143 must show leadership by getting themselves off the fossil fuel hook and securing the new jobs and economic benefits that building a low carbon economy will bring			0
’ the report , compiled by 55 scientists from 22 countries , highlighted the need for action but identified several areas where emissions can be cut , such as by walking and cycling instead of using cars , saving forests , and energy efficient appliances			0
it warned : ‘ current global emissions are already considerably higher than the emissions level consistent with the @entity165 target in 2020 and are still growing			1
‘ to stay within the 2 ° c limit global emissions will have to peak before 2020			1
‘ scenarios that meet the @entity165 limit have global emissions in 2050 roughly 40 per cent below 1990 emission levels and roughly 60 per cent below 2010 emission levels			1
‘ the gap can also be closed by swift and comprehensive action to scale up a wide range of tried - and - true policy actions			0
‘ these are actions that have worked around the world and in many different sectors , and which are not only beneficial to climate protection , but also satisfy a great variety of other local and national priorities			0

greenhouse gas emissions need to fall 14 per cent by 2020 but are still rising
@entity6 target can still be met but politicians need to act immediately
gap between emissions target and the real figure is widening
