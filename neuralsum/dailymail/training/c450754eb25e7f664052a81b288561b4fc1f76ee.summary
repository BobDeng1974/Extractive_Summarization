by @entity0 published : 12:09 est , 14 march 2014 updated : 15:13 est , 14 march 2014 many dieters attempt to fill themselves up with water in the belief it will help them lose weight			0
but one nutrition expert says it is simply a myth that drink water aids slimming			2
dr @entity11 , at the @entity10 , has stated that drinking water is not a magical key to weight loss			1
she said : ‘ there is very little evidence that drinking water promotes weight loss - it is one of those self - perpetuating myths			2
it is a myth that drinking water aids weight loss , according to a nutrition expert ‘ i 'm not saying drinking water is n't good - but only one study showed people who drank more water burned a few extra calories , and it was only a couple of extra calories a day			1
’ dr @entity11 added that it is also a myth that people should drink eight glasses of water a day			1
she said : ‘ yes , people do need to get fluids - but it does not have to be water			0
there 's no evidence that it melts away fat or makes you feel fuller , so if you do n't like water it 's ok			0
’ she explained that water is the best liquid to drink to hydrate but that green tea , coffee and squash are also hydrating			0
she said : ‘ people think coffee does n't count , but actually it does			0
‘ when you drink coffee , your body is retaining much of that fluid - especially for people who are habituated to drinking caffeine , as the body adapts , resulting in a reduced loss of fluids			2
’ dr @entity11 said some people also believe that drinking very cold water can help them lose weight			1
dr @entity11 says drinking very cold water can cause a dieter to burn a few more calories but not enough to make a tangible difference to weight she believes this can increase the number of calories burned but that it does not have sufficient impact to aid weight loss			1
the bad news for dieters is that dr @entity11 says the only way to lose weight is to eat fewer calories			2
she suggests focussing on eating fruit , vegetables and soups			0
dr @entity11 's claims contradict 2013 research which found that drinking two cups of water before a meal can help people lose weight			1
the research , published in the @entity89 , suggested drinking water can reduce hunger meaning dieters consume fewer calories .			0

dr @entity11 says it is a myth that drinking water aids weight loss
