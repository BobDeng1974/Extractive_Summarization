parents are increasingly dipping into their savings to fund their daughters freezing their eggs , one of @entity5 ’s leading fertility experts have said			1
as a growing number of women are prioritising financial stability and a fulfilling career over starting a family , parents fear that they may never become grandparents			2
the overwhelming desire for a second round of pitter - patter of tiny feet has led to a ‘ cultural shift ’ in the attitude towards the full range of fertility treatments among the older generation			1
happy families : the number of parents who fund fertility treatments such as freezing eggs and @entity27 for their daughters has increased in the past five years ‘ we are seeing a real social change , ’ dr professor dr @entity28 , medical director of @entity30 , and an @entity32 consultant told @entity33			1
‘ five years ago it was almost unheard of for patients to have their parents funding their @entity27 treatment or grandparents funding fertility treatment but now we receive a lot of inquiries			1
‘ i run frequent open days , the room takes anywhere between 16 and 20 couples in @entity47 and you tend to have at least two of three where parents come with their daughters now – that never happened before			1
’ a 2011 study found that parents spend more than £ 43,000 on their adult children until they turn 30			2
the most common subsidies are university fees , rent , house deposits and weddings			0
@entity62 change : desire to become grandparents see many pay for their child 's fertility treatment one in five parents now help their children to buy their first home , handing them an average of £ 23,000 each , a survey published last month has found			1
one in four of those had to cut back on their own day - to - day spending to contribute to their child ’s deposit , and 20 per cent dipped into funds saved up for their retirement and for elderly care fees			0
longstanding traditions in many cultures see the bride ’s family pay for a wedding ceremony , but with more and more women putting off getting married in order to first establish financial stability or choosing to have children before getting hitched , parents increasingly pay for fertility treatment instead			1
doctors say that this is down to a desire to become grandparents that is so strong that they would rather pay for their daughter to freeze her eggs than risk it never happening			1
this comes after doctors warned that it is ten times harder for a woman to become pregnant at 43 than at 37			0
the rapid speeding up of a woman ’s biological clock means that by the time she is 43 , she will need to go through 44 eggs on average to produce just one normal embryo			2
at 37 she needs just 4.4 , on average			0
a woman typically produces one egg a month , so this means it will take her almost four years to conceive – rather than only four months			2
researcher @entity115 said that the number of eggs needed for a viable pregnancy rises ‘ almost exponentially ’ after 42 , and urged women to freeze their eggs without delay			0
@entity5 experts said that while , ideally , women would have their babies in their twenties , the realities of modern life mean many have no choice but to wait			0
education , careers , lack of money and the hunt for ‘ mr @entity134 ’ are all causing women to put motherhood on the back burner			0
nearly half of all @entity5 babies are now born to women aged 30 and older , and the number born to women in their late thirties has almost trebled in recent years			0
controversially , internet companies @entity142 and @entity143 are offering to pay female employees to freeze their eggs			2
the ‘ perk ’ – at the moment for employees in the @entity155 only – is aimed at boosting the number of women staff by allowing them to focus on their careers without sacrificing the opportunity to have children later in life .			0
