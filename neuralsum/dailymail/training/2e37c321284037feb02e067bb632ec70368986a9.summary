instead , she became a high - altitude @entity71 2 pilot flying at altitudes of 13 miles above the @entity9 's surface one giant leap for mankind : @entity0 and her fellow @entity71 2 pilots are required to wear full pressure suits and special helmets – not unlike @entity4 astronauts ’ gear - and are allowed to fly only once every three days ‘ think of how far you can go , because you can reach those			1
