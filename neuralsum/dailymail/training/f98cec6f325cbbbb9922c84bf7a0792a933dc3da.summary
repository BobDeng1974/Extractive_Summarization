he would say that she was too attractive , her fault then , and more significantly that he could n't do things for her without it happening			0

he said he worked at the pirate station @entity128 and @entity151			0
the prosecutor said : ' @entity155 's case , in a nutshell , is that he used the celebrity that he had to abuse young girls in various ways and that the other two defendants - mr @entity99 and mr @entity105 , friends and associates of @entity98 - also became involved on occasions			0
' he told the jurors that they were not tasked with determining the scale of @entity10 's abuse and that the defendants should not be contaminated ' because of the spectre of @entity168 '			1

mr @entity35 said she ended up having sex with @entity0 until she was 15 and said the defendant was capable of kindness and could be charming and funny			2
the prosecutor said : ' the evidence of ( the alleged victim ) paints a terrible picture of depraved conduct , does it not ? this is someone who became locked into a world where all values were utterly distorted , where @entity0 's kindness to her was used to achieve sex , her loyalty to him and , you may think , her hero - worship of him was such that she would continue to be involved with him and , much worse , she would even ask her friends to get involved			2
' one of those friends went on to be abused at the age of 13 by @entity0 and @entity99 , according to the @entity155			0
mr @entity35 said this complainant was another ' young , naive , vulnerable ' girl who was ' to a greater or lesser extent starstruck and charmed '			0
@entity105 ( pictured outside court today ) denies one count of attempted rape another friend introduced to @entity0 at the age of 14 would record jingles for one of his radio shows and would be given free records			0

@entity0 raped her one night as she recalled trying to fight him off , the court heard			1

mr @entity35 said : ' she had said nothing during sex with @entity98 ' because he was a man and i was a kid and i would n't , i just would n't have said anything , i would have just done as i was told but i would have felt wrong saying something to someone that much older than me '			0
another complainant , aged 15 at the time , recalled being indecently assaulted by @entity0 in his car at a time when he was a dj on @entity285 in the @entity287 area			2

the defendant went on to say that teenage girls did nothing for him , said the @entity155			0
but mr @entity35 told the jury : ' in light simply of the evidence you will hear in this case , the @entity155 say that young teenage girls , far from doing nothing for him , were consistently pursued by him through the ' 60s and ' 70s			2
