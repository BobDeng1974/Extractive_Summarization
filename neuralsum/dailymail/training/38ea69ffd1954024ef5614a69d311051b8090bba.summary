by @entity0 identical triplets born to a @entity3 couple three months ago have been diagnosed with the same , extremely rare form of eye cancer			1
@entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 are all suffering from retinoblastoma , a cancer so rare there are only about 20 cases diagnosed in @entity3 every year			1
their parents , @entity15 and @entity16 , noticed that one of the babies had an odd - shaped pupil , and following testing , were told that each of their tiny sons had retinoblastoma			1
tiny things : the babies were born six weeks premature but appeared in perfect health the @entity26 had moved @entity27 for @entity29 's medical residency with their two - year - old son @entity30 when they were given the news that @entity16 was carrying not one but three babies			1
the chance of conceiving identical triplets naturally is about one in a million , and @entity15 and @entity16 were surprised but excited about the prospect of being parents to triplets			1
a few months after the triplets were born , @entity15 noticed a strange change in @entity7 's eye			1
' i noticed @entity7 had an odd pupil like a tear drop , i thought it was a little odd , ' he told the @entity46			1
' i thought about it and talked to my friend who is an eye doctor , and he told me to take a picture with the flash and look for red reflex , and there was no red reflex , it was white			2
' retinoblastoma : a photograph of the pupil of a child with the condition will show a white reflection , indicating the presence of a tumor behind the eye top medical care : the @entity26 meet with their eye specialist dr @entity66 ( left ) the @entity26 took @entity7 to a specialist who diagnosed retinoblastoma , a rare cancer that 's most common in young children			1
the doctor then examined @entity8 and @entity6 and gave the @entity26 the devastating news that they , too , had the condition			1
it turns out that the shape of @entity7 's pupil had nothing to do with the retinoblastoma , but were it not for @entity29 's curiosity , the cancer may have advanced to a much more dangerous stage before the boys were diagnosed			1
' we obviously are devastated , ' one of the @entity26 wrote on the family blog			0
' my heart nearly shattered to pieces when i heard the news , but i am trying to put myself back together			0
there 's no time to be brokenhearted when you have four beautiful boys to care for			0
' the family realizes their uniquely unlucky situation			0
keeping the faith : @entity16 and @entity29 say their faith , family and friends are getting them through this time baby joy : despite their condition , the triplets are feeding and sleeping normally , say their parents on their blog they wrote : ' chances of marrying while at @entity108 [ @entity108 ] , 1/3			2
chances of having a boy , 1/2			0
chances of having four boys in a row , 1/16			0
chances of spontaneous identical triplets ( no in vitro ) , 1/1,000,000			1
chances of triplets having retinoblastoma , unheard of [ sic ]			2
" the condition is the result of a gene mutation that occurred before the egg split into three , resulting in all three boys having retinoblastoma			0
the family flew to @entity124 for treatment , where they were given individual diagnoses for each baby			0
the @entity26 were told that @entity8 had 10 tumors scattered in both eyes , but located in the peripheral areas , not causing any central visual impairment			2
the tumors were treated with a laser			0
@entity7 had one main tumor in his left eye , along with smaller cancer cells that could develop into a tumor			1
he has been treated with localized chemotherapy and laser treatment to diminish the large tumor and prevent it growing any further			2
recovering : @entity142 after surgery to remove his eye doctors are hoping to save his left eye with systemic chemotherapy , which will be performed when he is slightly older			0
@entity6 , who had the most serious case of the three , had a large central tumor that was too big to treat with laser or chemotherapy injection			2
the @entity26 had to make a quick decision to either try systemic chemotherapy , a risky treatment for a baby who weighs barely nine pounds , or to remove @entity6 's right eye			1
systemic chemo gave them only a 50 per cent chance of saving the eye , but could have resulted in hearing loss , kidney failure or brain cancer			2
' all to save an eye that wouldnâ € ™ t see , ' @entity163 said			0
' we decided to just focus on his good eye			0
' the @entity26 opted to have @entity6 's right eye removed , which will help to strengthen his left into a ' super-eye			1
' since his surgery last friday , @entity6 has recovered well			2
he has been fitted with a temporary prosthetic eye that will be exchanged for a more permanent one when he 's older			0
' you know , we have prayed for a miracle , and a miracle did happen , ' @entity16 wrote on the family blog			0
' all babies have at least one really good eye			0
prayers truly are being answered			0
' all three babies will need to be constantly monitored - every two weeks - for new tumors until the retina stops growing at around age two .			1

@entity3 identical triplets all have a very rare form of eye cancer
@entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 are only three months old but have *undergone* treatment for retinoblastoma
@entity6 has had one eye removed and @entity7 may require the same treatment
they will require follow - up checks and further treatment every two weeks until their retinas stop growing , at around age two
only about 20 cases of retinoblastoma are diagnosed in @entity3 each year
naturally conceived identical triplets are about one in a million
