by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson it ’s being called ‘ the @entity10 against the @entity10 ’ as @entity5 holders @entity3 and @entity6 conquerors @entity7 get ready to face each other in the @entity9 on saturday			1
@entity11 is back from two weeks rest , @entity13 is fresh from scoring twice for @entity14 , and despite the fact that @entity22 and @entity23 were sharing jokes with @entity7 rivals @entity16 and @entity17 on wednesday night as they watched @entity19 crash out of the @entity20 together , the rivals are ready to rumble again on saturday just three weeks after they clashed in a heated @entity27 double header			1
both sides ’ managers have seen their trophy winning teams partially dismantled this summer – atletico by necessity and @entity3 by presidential whim			2
in the rebuilding stakes , @entity35 seems to be trailing @entity37			2
videos scroll down to watch ... @entity11 returns for @entity3 after a two week rest during the international break @entity3 have lost @entity41 to @entity42 in a £ 60million move he has lost the energy of @entity41 from his midfield three and is still contemplating moving @entity13 back there to compensate			1
the alternative is to persist with new man @entity47 alongside @entity48 and @entity49 but the @entity50 does not have the engine that @entity41 had and @entity35 feels it makes for a midfield trio that leaves its defence exposed			2
@entity7 also lost players in the summer but @entity37 ’s formation and tactics remain largely unchanged			1
@entity59 replaces @entity60 , @entity61 replaces @entity62 in goal , and @entity64 and @entity65 replace @entity66 – yes it ’s taken two men for that job : @entity64 to get the goals and @entity71 to stretch teams with his pace and provide the quick out ball for his team - mates			1
@entity22 ( left ) and @entity23 watched @entity19 crash out of the @entity20 on wednesday @entity35 may decide to drop new boy @entity47 ( right ) for the @entity3 derby @entity13 returns to @entity3 duty after a brilliant two - goal performance for @entity14 behind them @entity7 remain the same rock solid two - banks of four team they were last season and they have also lost none of their efficiency from set - plays			1
three of their last four goals have been scored from a set - piece including @entity91 ’s strike from a @entity16 corner as @entity7 drew the first leg of the @entity27 against @entity3 1 - 1			1
@entity35 is well aware of the threat and saw his team defend poorly against @entity96 losing 4 - 2 before the international break			0
he will want greater concentration and possibly a better aerial presence , which is why an injury to right - back @entity101 is not the worst possible news			0
@entity66 ( above ) left @entity7 for @entity103 but replace him with @entity64 @entity7 do n't seem to have been too unsettled by the loss of last season 's stars such as @entity62 @entity37 was given an eight - match ban for conduct in @entity27 last month it will give @entity35 the chance to put @entity22 at right back and bring @entity111 – excellent for @entity112 against @entity19 ’s @entity66 last week – into the centre of defence			1
@entity115 will be the other change at the back , coming in for @entity118 who has just returned from a 9,000 mile round trip from @entity7 to the @entity120 for two friendlies in which he did n’t play a single minute			0
‘ these derbies are more evenly balanced than they used to be ’ says @entity7 full - back @entity17			0
‘ @entity3 supporters look at us differently these days ’			0
for 14 years @entity7 failed to beat their wealthier neighbours but @entity37 has drastically changed the football landscape in the @entity19 capital			2
@entity129 celebrates scoring the opening goal of the @entity5 final against @entity3 @entity3 suffered a 4 - 2 defeat against @entity96 in their last @entity6 outing in the rebuilding stakes , @entity35 ( right ) seems to be trailing @entity37 and do n’t let any @entity7 fans hear you say : ‘ yes but are they a wonder season wonder ? ’ it was two years ago that @entity7 beat @entity3 in the @entity141 final and at the end of that season their ability to ‘ go again ’ was questioned			1
‘ go again ’ they did , winning not the cup but the league itself			0
as reigning champions and having started the season without the doubts that seem to be affecting @entity3 , they will not be intimidated in the @entity9 – despite the 81,000 cauldron that awaits them			0
their measly allocation of 250 tickets continues to be taken up slowly so there will be no red and white wall of noise and neither will @entity7 have @entity37 prowling the touchline			2
after clipping the fourth official round the back of the head in the second leg of the @entity27 he is still serving part of his eight - match ban			0
@entity3 defeated @entity7 to win the 2014 @entity5 final this summer @entity37 ( right ) has replaced @entity66 with @entity64 ( left ) and @entity65 his assistant @entity165 @entity164 will take his place and like his superior he is no stranger to derbies having played in goal for @entity7 for four years			1
he saved a @entity170 penalty with his nose in the 2003 meeting at the @entity173 and then conceded one of the fixture ’s fastest goals a season later when he was beaten by @entity11 after 14 seconds			0
the other ronaldo – @entity11 – is winding himself up ready to be unleashed on the @entity10			0
kept out of @entity3 ’s 4 - 2 defeat to @entity96 and @entity179 ’s miserable week of international woe , he returns to the team and can edge closer to a few more @entity7 milestones			2
@entity11 ( centre ) has scored 255 goals in 250 games for @entity3 he has scored 255 goals in 250 games for @entity7 including 178 times in @entity6			1
there are only three players between him and all - time club top scorer status with leader @entity91 just 68 goals ahead – having played 11 seasons more			0
no wonder when asked if he was worried about the team ’s poor start to the season this week @entity35 told @entity199 ’s @entity198 : ' i can rest safe in the knowledge that we have two very important things : a group of very professional players , and @entity11 who scores a goal a game			1
' @entity11 celebrates after scoring against @entity209 in the @entity27 in august			0
