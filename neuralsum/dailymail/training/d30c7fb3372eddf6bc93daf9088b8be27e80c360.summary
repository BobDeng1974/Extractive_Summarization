the first ambulance crew to arrive at @entity2 to treat @entity3 came from almost 10km away from the city 's busy inner west , paramedics have claimed			1
the @entity6 says the vehicle from @entity9 , in @entity2 's inner west , was the closest vehicle to the ground when the first emergency call was made at 2.29pm on tuesday afternoon			1
questions have been asked as to why an ambulance took 23 minutes to arrive at the @entity2 when the normal response time is under 10 minutes			1
the delay prompted health minister @entity16 to demand the head of @entity18 offer an explanation			2
the first ambulance crew to arrive at @entity2 to treat @entity3 came from @entity9 , almost 10km away from the stadium the first triple - 0 call from the @entity2 was made on tuesday at 2:29pm , almost six minutes after @entity3 was struck in the head by a ball during a match			1
that ambulance did not arrive until 23 minutes after the call , apparently due to a lack of vehicles in the area , paramedics say the ambulance which responded to the first emergency call did not arrive at the @entity2 until 23 minutes after the call , apparently due to a lack of vehicles in the area			1
according to @entity38 , @entity39 , the secretary of the @entity6 of @entity40 , claimed that there was a backlog of patients at @entity2 hospitals at the time of the accident , meaning paramedics could not respond to new emergencies			2
' @entity50 practice is that , if there 's no ambulances available in the immediate vicinity , they will send the closest available resource			0
our understanding is that , in the @entity3 incident , that crew was from @entity9 , ' he said			2
the ambulance service has been criticised in recent days for taking so long to respond to the first emergency call made from the @entity2 when the first ambulance failed to appear at the @entity2 , officials at the @entity2 made a second triple - 0 call			1
the second triple - 0 call was made at 2:37pm and an ambulance was sent to the @entity2 from the @entity67 in @entity68 , arriving seven minutes later at 2:44pm and before the first ambulance			1
according to mr @entity39 , it is likely an ambulance had been freed up between the first and second triple - 0 calls , possibly by offloading a patient or another emergency call being cancelled			2
a lone bat was placed out the front of the @entity2 member 's entrance where @entity3 was hit in the head by a ball during a cricket game mr @entity39 also said that trolley - block was a major source of frustration for paramedics			1
trolley - block happens when the hospitals are overcapacity and therefore there are delays in responses to emergency calls			0
in a statement , @entity92 clarified that all measures were taken to ensure the closest ambulance was dispatched to the @entity2			2
' the @entity96 , with a specialist doctor and paramedic on board , as well as another road ambulance were tasked to respond while the first two ambulances were en - rout , ' the statement read			0
@entity3 , pictured left as a boy growing up in @entity104 and right as a professional cricketer , is being mourned across @entity106 ' @entity107 â€™s was identified as the closest hospital			2
a road ambulance transport was determined by the medical team to be the fastest and safest route to hospital care , ' ' @entity92 always tasks the closest available paramedic crew to all @entity115 ( 000 ) emergency calls regardless of the station at which their shift originates , ' mr @entity3 was taken to @entity120 in @entity2 with significant head injuries			1
the 25 - year - old died due to severe head injuries sustained by a bouncer at the @entity2 he underwent major surgery but died on thursday afternoon			1
25 - year - old @entity3 was due to turn 26 on sunday			0
the @entity6 of @entity40 have blamed budget cuts on the delays in ambulance responses and highlighted the daily issues faced by paramedics			0
' @entity131 was given to seeking a meeting with the minister for health however based on the continued position of the @entity135 that no funds are available or will be made available to fund additional positions this was not seen as a productive option , ' they said			0
' the continued line that an additional 5 % is added to the @entity92 budget each year is not satisfactory as it is being swallowed up by other costs			0
' the @entity6 continue in light of the tragedy , claiming that they are forced to deal with limited resources and their pleas for additional funds and facilities are falling on deaf ears			0
' as tragic as this recent event is in the public eye , paramedics see this type of tragedy on a regular basis			0
