they are some of the most mysterious objects in our galaxy and have baffled astronomers for years			1
now scientists have produced a new detailed map that they hope will help to unravel what is floating in the space between the stars and absorbing some of the light they produce			1
it had long been assumed that there was little sitting in the vacuum that exists between the billions of stars in the @entity17			0
scroll down for interactive graphic and video the pattern of mysterious molecules in relation to the stars and dust of the @entity17 is shown in the graphic above			2
@entity26 shows the greatest concentrations of these molecules in the dustiest areas of our galaxy while blue denotes the lowest concentrations on the fringes however , astronomers began to notice that the light coming from some of the stars in the @entity17 was being interfered with to produce distinct lines			1
these became known as ' @entity39 ' and are thought to be caused by the absorption of light by molecules floating around in the space between the stars			1
some have speculated that this ' interstellar medium ' was composed of unusual rings of complex hydrocarbons and other large carbon - based molecules , but it has never been proved			1
' diffuse interstellar bands ' or @entity51 are dark lines in space that hide in the light			2
analysing rainbow - colour bands of starlight that have passed through space gives astronomers important information about the make - up of the space materials that the light has encountered			2
but in 1922 , the photographs of this light from the stars yielded some dark lines , indicating that some starlight was ' missing '' and that something in the interstellar medium between @entity69 and the star was absorbing the light			2
since then , scientists have identified more than 400 of these diffuse interstellar bands , but the materials that cause the bands to appear and their precise location have remained a mystery			1
researchers speculate that the absorption of starlight that creates these dark bands points to the presence of unusually large complex molecules , but proof of this has remained elusive			1
the nature of this puzzling material is important to astronomers because it could provide clues about the physical conditions and chemistry of these regions between stars			0
such details serve as critical components in theories as to how stars and galaxies formed			0
now two teams at the @entity102 , in @entity99 , @entity100 , have created a map that shows where these enigmatic molecules can be found in relation to the stars			2
' these results will guide researchers toward the best observations and laboratory experiments to pin down the properties and nature of these enigmatic molecules , ' said @entity114 , who led one of the teams that compiled the map			0
the interactive map above was produced by the team at @entity102 and allows the location of diffuse interstellar bands to be shown alongside the stars in the @entity17 or other features such as interstellar dust by dragging the bar in the top right corner or using the up or down cursor on your keyboard the researchers created the map using huge volumes of data obtained during extensive surveys of the night 's sky , such as from the @entity136			1
one group focused on the densest parts of the @entity17 using infrared observations that can cut through the dust clouds that obscure many of the stars there			0
the other group analysed the visible light from half a million stars , galaxies and quasars located on the fringes of our galaxy			1
here the diffuse interstellar bands are harder to detect , but the researchers were able to see patterns in the type of environments where they are more likely to come from			0
the light from the @entity17 , shown above , is concentrated along a plane and this is where most diffuse interstellar bands are detected the researchers also looked at the interstellar dust that exists to see if this could provide clues about what the mystery molecules are while molecules that absorb light in one way tended to be found in the densest regions of gas and dust , others were found in lonelier spots far away from stars			1
this suggests that rather than being a random jumble of different molecules , the molecules in interstellar space are more organised than previously thought			2
the team also found mysterious features in front of around 60,000 stars and were able to measure the motion of some of these			2
the resulting map allows the location of the diffuse interstellar band to be seen alongside the @entity17 's stars and also shows where concentrations of molecules such as hydrogen , @entity194 , who led the second team that helped compile the map , said : ' for the first time , we can see how these mysterious molecules are moving around the galaxy			1
' this is extremely useful and brings in new connections between these molecules and the dynamics of the @entity17			0
' diffuse interstellar bands were first detected in 1922 by astronomer @entity206 at the @entity207 , in @entity208			0
while analyzing the light from stars , she found unexpected lines that were created by something existing in the interstellar space between the stars and the @entity69			1
professor @entity215 , who oversaw the project at the department of physics and astronomy at @entity102 , said that while the map gave the most complete view so far of where the molecules that cause diffuse interstellar bands can be found , it was far from complete			1
he said : ' our galaxy is made of the following ingredients - atoms , small molecules , large ​ molecules , grains / rocks and stars			0
' over the past 30 years , astronomers were able to create maps for each of these constituents but not for the large molecules			1
they are much more difficult to detect			0
these molecules are mysterious in the sense that we can see their fingerprints in the light from stars but we can not identify exactly which molecules they are			2
we only know they are large molecules			0
' many generations of astronomers and physicists have tried to address this question but so far nobody has succeeded			0
​ this map is a new piece to the puzzle			0
we can not yet identified the nature of the molecules but we are getting one step closer			0
' we have developed new analysis techniques and made use of the largest spectroscopic dataset available to create a new large - scale map of these mysterious molecules			1
we can now make an image and " see " where they are in the sky and therefore where they are in the @entity17			0
' we can also see in which direction and how fast they are moving			0

@entity269 provides the most detailed look yet at where strange molecules that absorb light from the stars can be found
these molecules create what are known as @entity39 in the spectrum of light *emitted* by stars
astronomers analysed the light from *560,000* stars , galaxies and quasars to search for @entity39
the molecules causing these bands are thought to be large and complex hydrocarbons but remain a mystery
the map reveals that the molecules seem to absorb light in different ways depending on their location in space
it may help scientists finally work out what this mysterious interstellar matter is after being puzzled for *90* years
