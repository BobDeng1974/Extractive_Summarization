@entity1 scientists have developed a new test to detect what your tongue indicates about a person 's health			1
it can spot 14 different conditions for those feeling under the weather , the old adage of ' stick your tongue out ' , may betray the signs of the illness by which they are afflicted			1
the tongue can signal signs of a cough , fever , jaundice , headache or bowel habits , and helps doctors make their diagnosis			1
a healthy tongue should be pink , clean and covered in papillae , which contain taste buds			2
but inflamed , red , black or white tongues could be a sign of other conditions such as thrush , while a swollen tongue can be a sign of an allergic reaction			1
meanwhile a black , discoloured tongue is indicative of extended antibiotic use , or a fungal overgrowth in @entity38 patients , say @entity1 scientists			1
and long furrows on the surface are a sign of the sexually transmitted infection , syphilis			1
ulcers should ring alarm bells , warning of @entity47 's disease or ulcerative colitis			2
and a ' beefy and smooth ' tongue might reveal @entity50 , iron or folate deficiency , and anemia			0
moving on to more serious conditions , sores or lumps on the tongue - or unexplained bleeding - can be a sign of mouth cancer , warns @entity61			1
but for those living in remote parts of the world , where access to a doctor can be difficult , the simple act of checking a patient 's tongue can prove hard			1
to combat the problem , scientists in @entity1 have now developed a new test			1
the new diagnostic system , reported in the @entity74 , works to combine symptoms with a digital analysis of an image of the patient 's tongue			1
@entity79 , from @entity80 in @entity81 , and @entity82 and @entity83 of @entity84 at @entity85 , have developed the new software			0
the neural network can take ' soft inputs ' - standard questions about symptoms - and a digital image of a patient 's tongue to help offer a likely diagnosis			1
it aims to help decide if a professional healthcare worker should be sought out for further advice			0
the digital images of the patient 's tongue reveal discolouration , engorgement , texture , and other factors linked to various illnesses			1
the team 's automated diagnosis , however , ultilises the condition of the tongue in combination with other symptoms , to identify whether a patient has a common cold , flu , bronchitis , stretptococcal throat infection , sinusitis , allergies , asthma , pulmonary edema , and food poisoning			1
in its current form the system allows diagnosis of 14 distinct conditions			2
but the team hope they can soon add images of patient 's eyes to use as additional information , thus extending the system 's repertoire significantly			1
a recent study has discovered that the tongues of some people who snore are extra large			0
it 's already well - known that being overweight or obese increases the risk of obstructive sleep apnoea ( @entity136 ) , which leads to snoring because the airway becomes blocked			0
until now , it was thought that a large neck was to blame			0
now , however scientists say piling on the pounds can also cause a fat tongue - which may well be the culprit			2
@entity143 researchers found that obese people with @entity136 had a higher percentage of tongue fat - especially at the base of their tongues - which made their tongues larger overall			2
a recent study , published in the journal @entity153 , found the tongues of people who snore are extra large this was compared with obese people who did n't suffer from the sleep condition			0
increased tongue fat might prevent the tongue 's muscles from positioning the tongue away from the airway , causing snoring because the airway becomes blocked , researchers said			2
they added the study might provide an explanation for the link between obesity and sleep apnoea - and said screening to identify fat tongues may could help diagnose the condition			0
it 's known that obesity is a major cause of obstructive sleep apnoea , a condition where the throat closes repeatedly during the night			0
snoring occurs because the airways become narrowed , or even completely blocked , preventing the body from getting enough oxygen			0
in severe cases , the brain jolts the body awake , causing the airway to reopen			0
the person may wake up repeatedly without knowing it , increasing their heart rate and blood pressure and preventing deep sleep			0
dr. @entity192 , of the @entity193 in the @entity143 said : ' this is the first study to show that fat deposits are increased in the tongue of obese patients with obstructive sleep apnea			2
' dr @entity199 , president of the @entity200 said doctors should look at tongue size when screening for @entity136			2
he said : ' @entity204 size is one of the physical features that should be evaluated by a physician when screening obese patients to determine their risk for obstructive sleep apnoea			0
' effective identification and treatment of sleep apnoea is essential to optimally manage other conditions associated with this chronic disease , including high blood pressure , heart disease , ttype 2 diabetes , stroke and depression			0
' the study was published in the journal @entity153 .			0

scientists in @entity1 have developed a new test to spot 14 conditions
aimed at those people in remote areas without regular access to doctors
black tongue is a sign of over use of antibiotics and fungal overgrowth in @entity38 patients , while long furrows in the surface are indicative of syphilis
@entity243 uses symptoms combined with an image of the patient 's tongue
can offer a likely diagnosis and indicate if someone should see a doctor
