by @entity0 published : 13:16 est , 10 february 2014 @entity2 : 16:44 est , 10 february 2014 jailed : @entity3 , 51 , was caught stealing from the @entity5 's store where she worked after police were called in to investigate missing donations for an injured soldier a thieving @entity10 's manager was jailed for 12 months today after she held on to cash donations earmarked for a soldier who lost both legs in @entity14			1
@entity3 , 51 , had been entrusted with the money after workmates organised a collection for the injured squaddie whose grandparents worked in the store			1
but @entity3 , commercial manager on the customer service desk at the @entity23 branch in @entity24 , failed to hand over the £ 200 after it was collected in a bucket in the staff canteen			1
instead she repeatedly fobbed off the serviceman ’s grandmother and came up with various excuses when she was later asked about the cash three months after the collection			2
an embarrassed colleague eventually paid the money himself after being told by @entity3 to take the cash out of the till			1
the serviceman ’s family passed the money to the @entity39 charity			2
police were called in and discovered @entity3 carried out 254 cash refunds worth £ 5,000 between march 2010 and february 2011 when customers were not present during the transactions			1
@entity44 - who had worked for @entity10 for 25 years - would log in to tills for just a few minutes at a time and often put through refunds - mainly for bottles of wine - at a rate of more than one every 30 seconds , often billing more than £ 100 in less than 15 minutes			1
she had also held onto £ 70 which had been given to her by colleagues towards a works trip to @entity57			2
at @entity58 , @entity24 , @entity3 , from @entity59 , was found guilty of two counts of fraud and two counts of theft			1
but she was cleared of actually stealing the money earmarked for the soldier			1
judge @entity66 told her : ' it was your job to check that other people did n’t steal money , not to steal money yourself			2
that is what makes this such a flagrant breach of trust case			0
' it was n’t the amount of money that was important but you took the bucket and got the cashier to change it into notes and the despicable thing was that you held on to that money			2
' the grandmother repeatedly asked you where the money was and you fobbed them off			2
police were called to the @entity10 's store in @entity23 , @entity24 , pictured , where @entity3 worked after she failed to hand over £ 200 donations for an injured soldier			1
officers then discovered she had carried out hundreds of cash donations without a customer present ' it ca n’t be said that you stopped them getting the £ 200 but it was no thanks to you that they eventually got it			1
you did everything in your power to delay them getting the money			0
' your disgrace has been very public owing to the delay in paying of the money for the young man who was injured in @entity14			1
' if it had n’t been for your despicable behaviour i might have contemplated suspending this term			0
but it is wrong and impossible for me to do so having regard to this case in the round			0
' the court heard how store worker @entity113 , who worked on the deli counter at @entity10 , took a week off work when she learned in december 2010 that her soldier grandson @entity116 had been hurt			0
she said she learned about the collection when she returned to work at the store , where she had been employed for nine years			0
@entity119 had placed a collection bucket in the canteen and raised about £ 200			1
suspicions began after @entity3 took the bucket and got the cashier to change it into notes before taking the money to her office			1
in court : @entity3 was cleared of stealing the donations for the soldier but found guilty at @entity58 of committing theft and fraud at the @entity10 's store where she worked during the court case mrs @entity113 , whose husband @entity135 also worked at the store , told the jury : ' i had to keep going to @entity3 and ask when she was going to give me the collection money			1
' i did n’t like to ask , " have you got the money ? " i did say " i believe there ’s a collection " and she said " i ’ve got to count it "			0
she used to say " i ’ll see you tomorrow " or " i ’ll see you next week "			0
she did say , " i ’ve got to count it "			0
' asked how often she had asked about the collection , mrs @entity113 replied : ' it was quite a few times ' and added : ' people in the store thought i had already got the collection money and they were shocked when they found out so many weeks afterwards			2
' i must have asked her at least 12 times but there was always some excuse			0
' another member of staff , @entity157 , told the jury he had approached mrs @entity3 about the collection and she had told him to ‘ get it out of the till ’			1
staff told senior managers at @entity10 ’s about their concerns and @entity3 who had worked for the company for 25 years was suspended			1
she has since left the company			0
@entity3 said she had been keeping the collection bucket in her locker and had not produced the cash because the fundraising was ‘ ongoing ’			1
she said : ' it was not hidden			0
i was waiting for donations from members of the night staff who had told me they wanted to contribute			2
i took the collection bucket away because it did n’t need to stay out			0
' in mitigation defence counsel , miss @entity175 said : ' she is a respected member of the family and has shown a great deal of kindness and in that context it can be said these offences come out of character			0
' there is a history of personal difficulty she has had against a background of family tragedy and her own mental and emotional stability			0
' things have been sent to her address as well as deliberately targeted junk mail			0
she has felt hugely punished by her involvement but she looks forward with a sense of determination to get back and re-establish her reputation as a trusted member of the community who has much to give			0
' a @entity10 ’s spokesman said : ' we regard any crime of this nature very seriously and have robust processes in place to prevent such activities occurring			0
