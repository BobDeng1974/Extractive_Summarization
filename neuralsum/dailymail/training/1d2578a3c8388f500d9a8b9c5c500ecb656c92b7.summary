now , the baby - faced sprinter could become the nation ’s highest - paid @entity4 athlete as sponsors rush to sign him up			2
still wearing his gold medal , @entity2 , whose right leg was amputated below the knee after he contracted meningitis as a five - year - old , seemed oblivious to his newfound fame , insisting : ‘ i do n’t think life ’s going to change too much			1
‘ maybe i ’m naive , but i ’m still going to go out to @entity37 ’s with my mates			0
