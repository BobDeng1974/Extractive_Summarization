by setting the aperture to f.22 and leaving the shutter open for long periods upwards of four to five minutes for each shot , @entity45 was able to capture the trails left by aircraft lights as they buzzed overhead in this incredible picture the lights from the planes that have flown overhead hang in the sky like the threads of some luminous spider 's web critics say : @entity45 's carefully composed pictures describe the world almost like a painting , contrasting darkness with manmade light sources in the context of beautiful landscape backdrops ' in the case of this series , many minutes or even hours add up to construct a single image punctuated by the paths of commercial airplanes traversing the night skies , ' @entity45 said in a statement ' these white streaks , the only aspect of the planes visible in the photographs , are created by the landing and navigation lighting on every plane , ' he added in a statement accommpanying the project , @entity45 said : ' photography is by nature an exploration of time			1
the blink of an eye may be frozen by the shutter			0
