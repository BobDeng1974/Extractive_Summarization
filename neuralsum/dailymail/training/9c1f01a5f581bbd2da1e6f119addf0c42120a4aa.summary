by @entity0 an increasing number of couples set to marry this year are asking friends and family to give them cash instead of wedding presents			1
traditional gifts of toasters , microwaves and other household appliances are now seen as outdated , because the bride and groom have most likely already lived together for a number of years			1
financial contributions are seen as more useful - and those who feel awkward asking for them are turning to the power of verse to do it for them			2
@entity20 hard cash : an increasing number of couples set to marry this year are asking friends and family to give them cash instead of wedding presents many couples are choosing to write a poem inside their wedding invitations to avoid the embarrassment of asking outright for money			1
