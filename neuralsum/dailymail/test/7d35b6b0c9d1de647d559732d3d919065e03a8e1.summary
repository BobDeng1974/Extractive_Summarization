beach - goers were faced with a different kind of sea creature when they entered the water at @entity5 's picturesque @entity4 last week - a swimming echidna ! the prickly @entity8 mammal was filmed paddling out to sea in the turquoise waters off the @entity11 , 83 km south of @entity12			1
where it was heading , is anyone 's guess			0
they like the water so much , that the @entity33 built a special swimming pool for its echidna residents to cool off on hot summer days			0
@entity38 , like many native @entity8 animals , are actually ' proficient ' swimmers - though they usually prefer fresh water to the open ocean the echidna - or spiny ant - eater - is found all over @entity31 , in coastal forests , alpine meadows and desert habitats			1
they live on a diet of ants , termites , grubs and worms but biologists think the mammals evolved from aquatic ancestors like the platypus			1
@entity56 , a park ranger from @entity57 in @entity58 , said he has also seen wallabies and wombats surfing			0
he previously told the @entity61 he thought the animals went in the water to get rid of parasites , like lice and ticks			0
with its webbed - feet and snout in the air as a snorkle , the little echidna paddled out to sea			2

an echidna is filmed swimming in turquoise waters at @entity5 's @entity4
the land - based mammal looks to be using its ant - eating snout as a snorkel
echidnas are proficient swimmers , believed to have evolved from aquatic ancestors like the platypus
