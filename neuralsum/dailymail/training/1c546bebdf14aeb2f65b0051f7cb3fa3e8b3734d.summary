the @entity0 once had @entity1 and @entity2 leader @entity3 in custody at a detention facility in @entity7 , but president @entity8 let him go , it was revealed on friday			1
@entity10 was among the prisoners released in 2009 from the @entity0 's now - closed @entity12 near @entity13 in @entity7			1
but now five years later he is leading the army of ruthless extremists bearing down on @entity17 who want to turn the country into an @entity21 state by blazing a bloody trail through towns and cities , executing @entity7 soldiers , beheading police officers and gunning down innocent civilians			1
he is seen here on the left as a prisoner half a decade ago and on the right more recently as the shadowy head of the @entity1 , @entity1 , also known as @entity1 this uundated handout picture of jihadi leader of @entity39 ( @entity1 ) , @entity3 , also known as @entity3 , was provided by the @entity40			1
the @entity0 government has a $ 10 million bounty out for the @entity44 leader it is unclear why the @entity0 let the merciless @entity44 leader slip away , however , one theory proposed by @entity46 is that @entity49 was granted amnesty along with thousands of other detainees because the @entity0 was preparing to pull out of @entity7			1
the @entity0 began withdrawing troops from @entity7 in 2010,and @entity12 closed in 2011 along with the @entity0 ' other military facilities as president @entity8 declared that the @entity55 had come to an end			1
another possible explanation is that @entity49 did not become a jihadist until after his release from @entity12			0
the story of how @entity49 ended up in @entity0 custody in the first place and later came to be the leader of a violent terrorist group is the stuff of legend			2
it is said by some that @entity49 was in the wrong place at the wrong time when he was picked up by the @entity0 military , a farmer who got caught up in a massive sweep			0
it was at @entity12 that he was radicalized and became a follower of @entity76			0
another version of the story is that @entity49 , who also goes by the alias of @entity80 , was an @entity1 fundamentalist before the @entity0 invaded @entity7 and he became a leader in @entity44 's network before he was arrested and detained by @entity0 forces in 2005			1
' @entity85 was connected to the intimidation , torture and murder of local civilians in @entity90 , ' according to a 2005 @entity0 intelligence report			2
' he would kidnap individuals or entire families , accuse them , pronounce sentence and then publicly execute them			0
' crazed : jihadists are carrying out summary executions on civilians , soldiers and police officers including this police major after taking control of large swathes of @entity7 shock and awe : an @entity1 propaganda video shows militants blindfolding a @entity107 police major in his home before cutting off his head barbaric : this picture of the police officer 's decapitated head resting on his legs was tweeted with the message : ' this is our ball			1
it is made of skin @entity119 ' the @entity0 now has a $ 10 million warrant out out of the brute , who is accused of bombing a mosque in @entity125 in 2011 and killing former @entity107 lawmaker @entity126			1
@entity128 's use of aliases has made him a difficult man to pin down			2
the terrorist organizer rarely shows his face - even to his followers			0
there are only two known pictures of him in existence , and one is from before he was released from prison			0
' we either arrested or killed a man of that name about half a dozen times , he is like a wraith who keeps reappearing , and i am not sure where fact and fiction meet , ' lieutenant - general sir @entity147 , a former @entity148 special forces commander , told @entity46			0
' there are those who want to promote the idea that this man is invincible , when it may actually be several people using the same nom de guerre			0
' @entity128 and his troops had already taken key cities of @entity159 and @entity160 in @entity7 earlier this year and have conquered the @entity7 cities of @entity162 and @entity163 within the last several days			1
they are now on the war path to @entity7 's capitol city @entity125			0
the terrorist group 's sudden rise in @entity7 has taken the @entity0 mostly by surprise			1
president @entity8 famously said in october of 2011 that the @entity0 soldiers leaving @entity7 would come home ' with their heads held high , proud of their success			2
' that is how @entity0 ’s military efforts in @entity7 will end			2
' president @entity8 reiterated on friday that , ' we will not be sending us troops back into combat in @entity7 ' faced with the real possibility that @entity7 's capitol could fall into the hands of terrorists , president @entity8 is now rethinking @entity0 's military engagement in @entity7			1
the president said on thursday that he would consider launching air strikes on @entity49 and his followers			0
' what we 've seen over the last couple of days indicates @entity7 ’s going to need more help ' from the @entity0 and other nations , @entity8 said yesterday from the @entity192			2
' i do n't rule out anything , ' he said , ' because we do have a stake in making sure that these jihadists are not getting a permanent foothold in @entity7 – or @entity198 , for that matter			0
' in his daily briefing with reporters , @entity201 press secretary @entity200 clarified that president @entity8 was specifically referring to airstrikes			0
' we 're not considering boots on the ground , ' he said			0
on the warpath to @entity17 : a graphic showing the town and cities captured by @entity1 over the last few days up in arms : members of @entity7 security forces chant slogans in @entity17 @entity21 militants pressed towards the capital @entity217 - rattling : an @entity1 militant issues a call to arms , saying : ' @entity220 ! @entity221 is the @entity222 ! ' in a video released by @entity1 president @entity8 reiterated on friday that , ' we will not be sending us troops back into combat in @entity7			1
' @entity8 said the @entity0 would not get involved at all militarily until @entity7 president @entity227 and other members of the government demonstrate that they can put aside their secretarian differences and work toward unifying the country			2
' ultimately it 's up to @entity7 to solve their problems , ' @entity8 said			0
volunteers who have joined the @entity237 to fight against the predominantly @entity107 militants , who have taken over @entity163 and other @entity240 provinces , gesture from an army truck @entity245 @entity244 forces seize the control of @entity247 where @entity7 army forces and @entity1 clashed the news that the @entity0 may have played a role in the rise of the new @entity76 comes just a week after president @entity8 released five @entity253 commanders in exchange for a @entity0 solider being held hostage by the terrorist network			1
lawmakers immediately questioned the logic of the president 's decision , saying that the move could end up backfiring on the @entity0 if the five fighters return to the battlefield in @entity265 once their mandatory one - year stay in @entity267 comes to a close			2
they are especially concerned given the president 's announcement just days before their release that he plans to withdraw the majority of @entity0 's troops in @entity265 by the end of this year			1
already one , of the @entity253 5 have vowed to return to @entity265 to fight @entity0 soldiers there once he is able			0
' i would n't be doing it if i thought that it was contrary to @entity0 national security , ' the president said at the time .			0
