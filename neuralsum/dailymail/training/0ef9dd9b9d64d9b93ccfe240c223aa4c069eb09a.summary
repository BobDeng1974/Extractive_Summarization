two months after delivering a petition with 84,000 signatures to the editor - in - chief , @entity9 has convinced @entity4 against altering and airbrushing its models to tiny and blemish - free proportions			1
@entity4 ’s editor - in - chief , @entity14 , responded to the campaign in the magazine 's latest issue with a letter to readers , vowing that the magazine will never change the shapes of girls ’ bodies or faces			1
victory : @entity4 's editor - in - chief , @entity14 ( left ) , responded to @entity9 ( right ) and campaign in the magazine 's latest issue , vowing that the magazine will never change the shapes of girls ' bodies or faces ms @entity14 acknowledged that the magazine had been contacted by readers who felt it was digitally enhancing photos and wondered if the magazine had ' gone too far , ' after teenagers gathered outside @entity4 's @entity41 office to protest @entity4 's fervent use of airbrushing two months ago			1
the eight - grade student started the online petition to the teen magazine in hopes it would change its photoshopping policies and in turn help promote more positive , and realistic , body images among teen readers			1
the teenagers also demanded that editors of the @entity55 title ' commit to printing one unaltered - real - photo spread per month			2
' ' @entity4 listened ! ' miss @entity9 wrote tuesday in a message posted on @entity58 , a social petition facilitation website			1
' they ’re saying they wo n’t use @entity5 to digitally alter their models			0
this is a huge victory , and i ’m so unbelievably happy			0
' after her success with @entity4 , miss @entity65 has now decided to tackle @entity67 , posting a new online petition asking the teen fashion magazine to follow @entity4 ’s example and ' pledge not to alter any model ’s body or face and to celebrate beauty in all its forms '			1
miss @entity9 said during the may protest outside @entity4 's offices : ' i know much how much pictures in the media have an effect in the self esteem of girls and their body image			1
' @entity86 teens : @entity9 , 14 , stood outside the magazine 's @entity88 headquarters and led a protest against the industry 's fervent use of @entity5 , before hand delivering her petition with 84,000 signatures the magazine said it invited miss @entity65 to its offices after seeing her petition , called @entity4 : @entity98 ! ms @entity100 ’s letter to readers also provides insight into the magazine ’s photography and why it decided to create a @entity105 , endorsed by the @entity106 and the @entity107 , which it hopes will help young girls stop obsessing about their bodies			1
@entity100 said @entity4 retouches images , removing wrinkles in fabric , stray hairs , pimples and bra straps , but never alters the way the girls ' really ' look			2
she admitted the petition campaign made her realise that the magazine had to be more public about its commitment , which led to the @entity121			2
the treaty contains eight conditions that @entity4 ’s staff must abide by , including ' never change girls ’ body or face shapes ( never have , never will )			1
' the treaty says the magazine will ' celebrate every kind of beauty in our pages			2
without a range of body types , skin tones , heights , hair textures , the magazine and the world would be boring			2
' @entity4 's support : the magazine said it invited miss @entity65 to its offices to meet with ms @entity14 after seeing her petition , called @entity4 : @entity98 ! the teenager originally uploaded the @entity4 petition on the campaigning website @entity58			1
spread through social media , miss @entity65 's petition gained around 6,000 signatures in ten days			1
with the help of a press release from a @entity154 pr firm , major news sites and blogs picked up the story and the number quickly grew to over 20,000			0
' this is really exciting , ' miss @entity9 told @entity160 in may			2
' i now know that there are a lot of girls who feel the same way as i do about this			0
' miss @entity9 , who is also a regular blogger for the ' girl - fueled ' activist group @entity167 , an organization that fights the sexualization of girls , wrote in her petition that ' those pretty women that we see in magazines are fake			1
' she continued : ' they 're often photoshopped , airbrushed , edited to look thinner and to appear like they have perfect skin			0
a girl you see in a magazine probably looks a lot different in real life			0
' editor 's letter : in this month 's issue , ms @entity14 acknowledged that the magazine will take steps to ensure models ' are bodies are no longer altered she also claimed that the constant use of airbrushing by the title has led to low self - esteem levels among her friends			1
the petition read : ' girls want to be accepted , appreciated and liked			0
and when they do n't fit the criteria , some girls like to fix themselves			0
this can lead to eating disorders , dieting , depression and low self - esteem			0
' miss @entity9 , who is also enrolled in ballet classes at her middle school , recalled some of the comments she hears at school , in the petition			2
they include ' it 's a fat day ' and ' i ate well today but i still feel fat			0
' the outspoken teenager also targeted the media , claiming that it ' tells us that pretty girls are impossibly thin with perfect skin			0
' while such criticism is often voiced and discussed among adults , the words are less commonly heard through children or teenagers			0
the news comes after @entity67 's new health initiative , which was announced at the beginning of may			0
@entity225 and the editors of @entity67 ’s 19 international editions agreed to ' encourage a healthier approach to body image within the industry ' .			0
