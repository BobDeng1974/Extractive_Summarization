by @entity0 @entity1 & @entity2 are to star in a new stage version of the hit tv show of @entity5 a reunion after nearly 30 years is always going to be a nostalgic event , but i did n't expect this			1
gruff @entity11 @entity1 is sitting in front of me , big fat tears rolling down his face , as he talks about when he first realised the 1980s sitcom @entity5 was special			1
' it was one of the first scenes we did , when @entity2 ( @entity2 , who played his shrewish wife ) pushed me into a pond , ' he says , misting over			1
' and as i was under the water i was smiling to myself thinking , " this is good , this is really good			1
" ' @entity2 , who 's sitting next to him , smiles and pats him on the knee			1
it 's been a bit emotional all round			1
@entity5 only ran for two years , from 1984 to 1986 , but was one of the biggest comedies of the decade , regularly attracting 12 million viewers			1
the show was a farce about two working - class @entity34 , @entity36 and @entity37 , enjoying their first trip to @entity39			1
there they meet posh @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 , and @entity36 and @entity44 decide they 're in love , mainly because he pretends to be a lot more worldly than he really is			1
there 's lots of hiding in wardrobes and romantic interludes rudely interrupted , mostly by @entity37 who 's determined to keep @entity36 from straying by constantly outwitting him			1
all the while @entity43 remains blissfully oblivious to the whole thing			2
the show 's still regularly aired on various satellite channels , and @entity1 says he gets stopped at least four times a day by people who want to talk to him about it			1
' and i 'll get people in the supermarket joking , " are you going to pay for that in pesetas ? " ' laughs @entity2			2
she says the show struck a chord with so many because the couple had the same flaws as real people			1
' women would stop me in the street and say , " @entity36 's just like him " about their husbands			2
the fibbing and the sucking in of the stomach when the ladies walked past , the pretending to be sophisticated with wine			2
@entity37 always knew that once she got him home he 'd be back to normal - he 'd just had his head turned			2
the thing about the show was it was always on the verge but you never saw any sort of sex			1
they were always thwarted by a donkey , or a monkey ... but mainly by me			2
' the original cast of @entity5 in 1984 @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity89 and @entity90 @entity1 laughs and adds , ' taxi drivers used to shout at me , " have you got your leg over yet ? " and i 'd say " no " - we all knew if i got my leg over there 'd be no show			1
it was all about the pursuit			2
' no wonder then - hot on the heels of the rejuvenated sitcom @entity102 - a new stage show is bringing @entity5 back to life			1
' when they first approached me about it i thought , " what took you so long ? " ' says @entity1 , 79 , who 's been popping up in everything from @entity111 to @entity112 ever since			2
' we enjoyed the success of it so much			2
i just thought , " i have to do it			2
" ' but @entity2 , 75 , who was given her own sitcom , @entity118 , after @entity5 finished , almost turned it down			1
@entity89 who played @entity44 , the object of @entity36 's affections , was unable to do it because she 'd just become a grandmother to twins			2
but she 's been replaced by @entity124 while @entity90 returns as @entity43			2
' i was worried that without @entity89 the whole thing would be unbalanced but @entity124 is wonderful , ' says @entity2			2
we meet just five days into rehearsals			2
' the first week has been a bit awful , ' says @entity1 , lowering his voice			0
' it 's been a bit messy , ' adds @entity2			0
' people assume we do n't need to bother getting to know the characters but it was 30 years ago			1
and there 's been a fair bit of crying , ' she adds			0
' getting back together has been really moving ; this show meant so much to us			1
it made us household names and that 's an amazing thing			0
' the new show , @entity141 , picks up the story 30 years on			1
surprisingly , given that they 've barely seen each other for 30 years , their easy chemistry makes @entity2 and @entity1 seem like they really have been married for decades			1
' we 've spoken a bit but not really stayed in touch			0
' says @entity1 , ' that 's the odd thing about the business			0
you take up where you left off			0
' the new show , @entity141 , picks up the story 30 years on			1
@entity36 has bumped into @entity44 at a train station in @entity155 and the two have planned a secret rendezvous at the @entity39 hotel where their frustrated love affair first started			0
but then their spouses find out ; and all four find themselves back in @entity39			0
three decades on means 30 years older though , and at the rehearsal studio today both are carefully avoiding the low sofa - ' you 'll never get up from that , ' @entity2 warns @entity1			1
' oh , it 's terrible			0
we 're old now , ' says @entity1			0
' yes , we 've got aches in our knees and our hips , ' adds @entity2			0
' when i see old episodes of the show i look so beautiful and young that i ca n't bear it			1
' the play has been penned by original @entity5 writer @entity177 , and he knows his leading pair well enough to incorporate some of their own characteristics into it			1
' i can be a bit rude at times , ' says @entity2 , who 's married to playwright @entity184 in real life			0
' i do come out with things and then think , " oh no , i should n't have said that			0
" ' @entity1 , who has two sons with his stage designer wife @entity189 , admits he empathises with @entity36 's constant fibbing			0
' i think most men lie , ' he shrugs			0
' it 's the quest for something better in life			0
i think @entity36 would like to be staying at the @entity195 - if he 'd heard of the @entity196 ; he 's always trying to climb out of the situation he is in			0
' our characters were from the common herd			0
we are everyman and everywoman and people used to like seeing us getting one over on the posh people			0
' @entity1 ' our characters were from the common herd			0
we are everyman and everywoman and people used to like seeing us getting one over on the posh people			0
it was a show families would watch together because there was never any sex in it			1
they do n't really make sitcoms for families now			0
' the show required a certain amount of suspension of disbelief ; essentially the group were on the same holiday for over two years			1
and the series never actually made it to @entity39 ( although one @entity220 special was partly filmed there ) because of budget constraints			1
the resort was replicated at @entity224 studios - money was so tight there was only one bedroom with curtains and soft furnishings being changed between scenes depending on who was supposed to be sleeping there			0
with the success of sitcoms like @entity235 and @entity236 , could a tv comeback be next for @entity5 if all goes well on tour ? ' i say yes , but quietly , ' says @entity1			1
' at the moment i 'm more concerned about trying to get ready for the tour			0
' ' i 'd be worried about high - definition , ' adds @entity2			0
' it 's so cruel and shows every flaw			0
even the most beautiful girls look flawed on it			0
' @entity1 grabs @entity2 's hand as if they 'd skipped over 28 years in a heartbeat , ' oh , but darling , you look lovely			1
' the @entity250 tour of @entity141 opens on tuesday at the @entity251 , @entity252			0
