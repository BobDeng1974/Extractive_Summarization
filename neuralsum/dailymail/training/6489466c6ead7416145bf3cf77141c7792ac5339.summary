he was approached by the @entity3 government to take over the @entity15 factory after @entity14 announced it was closing it , putting 1,173 jobs at risk			1
but after a trip round the base , the famously abrasive boss of @entity28 told @entity3 industry minister @entity31 he can ‘ keep his so - called workers ’			1
yesterday he told the @entity33 there was no comparison between the hard - working staff at his @entity38 plant in @entity39 , @entity40 , and the union - cosseted tyre makers he found in northern @entity3			1

‘ they were telling us , “ we ’re not going to agree to anything until you do what we say ”			0

i ’ve got enough people thinking i ’m nuts even attempting to come over and run this facility and spend millions of dollars on it ”			0
’ ‘ the @entity3 worker can be as productive as anyone else when he works , but he ’s not working , ’ mr @entity1 said			1

‘ do you think we ’re stupid ? ’ , mr @entity1 asked mr @entity31 in a letter published in @entity3 business newspaper @entity183			1
‘ i ’ve visited this factory several times			0
the @entity3 workers are paid high wages but only work three hours , ’ he said			1
‘ they get one hour for breaks and lunch , talk for three hours and work for three			0
’ he warned that @entity195 and @entity196 tyre makers were taking over the market in @entity198 , adding : ‘ in five years , @entity199 wo n’t be producing tyres in @entity3			2
you can keep your so - called workers			0
’ mr @entity1 ’s remarks have provoked anger in @entity3 where the high tax , big government policies of socialist president @entity113 are raising fears about declining competitiveness			1
mr @entity31 has declined to comment on the @entity5 ’s letter , saying only : ‘ i do n’t want to harm the interests of @entity3			1
’ the @entity77 union – the main target of mr @entity1 ’s anger – said the ‘ insulting ’ letter showed that its author was more of a ‘ lunatic ’ than someone fit to ‘ hold the reins of a multinational ’			2

she told @entity3 newspapers : ‘ instead of thinking about their work , people think about their weekends , organising , planning and engineering time off			1
‘ if you say to a @entity3 person , “ would you like to be an entrepreneur ? ” all they do is run scared			2
