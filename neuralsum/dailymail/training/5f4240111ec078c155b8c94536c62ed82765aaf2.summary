' concerns : @entity5 's $ 61 billion a year wine industry may suffer if it loses access to vital water for next year 's crop restricted access : farmers in the state 's usually productive agricultural region will have to limit their crops of almonds , above , and fruit the drought could also have a worrying impact of @entity5 's $ 61 billion wine industry			1

it takes two years for a vine to bear fruit , so a drought this year could devastate crops for the following harvest			0
' what we really have n’t seen that could happen is , if it ’s dry enough , grapevines actually become damaged and start to die , so you do n’t get the buds you need for the 2015 season , ' viticulture professor @entity92 told @entity100			0
' that potentially could become devastating , and it ’s not like when you ’re growing corn or something when you can just plant again next year			0
it ’s a 30 - year commitment			0
' friday 's announcement that access to the reservoir has been cut off marks the first time officials have had to curtail the supply in the 54 - year - history of the @entity112			1

relic : the walls from a ghost town submerged under @entity122 since 1955 have reappeared because of the drought revealing : foundations of the mining town are back on dry land after water levels dramatically receded in @entity122 ' this is the most serious drought we 've faced in modern times , ' @entity128 , of the @entity129 , said			1
' we need to conserve what little we have to use later in the year , or even in future years			0
' farmers in @entity5 's @entity135 , one of the most productive agricultural regions in the country , can draw water from federally run reservoirs and canals , but they will deliver just a fraction of the normal water allotment this year			1
director of the state 's @entity145 , @entity147 , said there simply was n't enought water to meet the needs of farmers and cities			2
the conservation efforts were intended to save dwindling populations of salmon and other fish in northern @entity5 , he added			1

' these actions will protect us all in the long run , ' mr @entity147 said			2
the latest restrictions come after governor @entity164 made an official drought declaration halfway through january			0

last year was the state 's driest calendar year since records started being kept , and 2014 appears to be heading in the same direction			0
a snow survey on thursday in the @entity172 , one of the state 's key water sources , found the water content in the meager snowpack is just 12 percent of normal			1

@entity192 are running dry or reservoirs are nearly empty in some communities			0
state water officials typically announce they are raising the water allotment on february 1 , but this year 's winter has been so dry they wanted to ensure they could keep the remaining water behind the dams			1
groundwater levels already have been stressed , after pumping accelerated during the dry winter in 2008 and 2009			2
' the challenge is that in the last drought we drew down groundwater resources and never allowed them to recover , ' said @entity209 , of the @entity211 water policy think tank in @entity213			2
' we 're seeing long term , ongoing declining groundwater levels , and that 's a major problem			2
