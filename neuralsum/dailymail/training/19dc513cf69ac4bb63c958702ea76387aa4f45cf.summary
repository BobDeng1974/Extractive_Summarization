by @entity0 women 's hour presenter @entity2 has claimed that it is still a man 's media world @entity6 presenter @entity2 is n't one to mince her words			1
along with her co-presenter @entity8 the established @entity9 encourages lively debate on her @entity13 women 's interest show , whether the topic is @entity15 or feminism in the workplace			0
now , ahead of her new radio series on female pioneers , the broadcaster has slammed the sexist radio industry for reducing women to giggling sidekicks			1
writing for the @entity26 's @entity25 column the 49 - year - old has revealed that she was n't surprised about the ' kerfuffle ' surrounding the appointment of the two female presenters to the rather old - fashioned @entity31			1
earlier this month @entity32 became the show 's second female anchor as she joined @entity35 at the controls			1
the 40 - year - old @entity40 graduate 's arrival raised eyebrows and while @entity43 director - general @entity42 claimed that he was ' very pleased ' to have more female voices on the programme , @entity37 warns that there is still a long way to go			1
talking about men still dominating the airwaves she says in the blog : ' the truth is , it 's still a man 's media world and we 're a little bit lucky to be a part of it			0

men still dominate at peak times : breakfast and drive , the programmes you want as a presenter , with a chance of an audience and a bigger share of the resources			0
' @entity37 puts this down to the perceived lack of authority or ' gravitas ' of a female presenter , and goes on to questions the personality traits of a successful radio talent : ' i do sometimes wonder , late at night , whether the rather toxic mix of arrogance and insecurity required to do this sort of gig is more common in men than women , ' she ponders			2
