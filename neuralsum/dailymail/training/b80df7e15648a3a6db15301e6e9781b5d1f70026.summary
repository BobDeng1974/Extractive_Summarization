by @entity0 published : 06:43 est , 29 may 2012 updated : 10:49 est , 29 may 2012 a mother says she feels like a monster after a bungled £ 4,000 dental procedure left her totally toothless			1
@entity4 , 48 , now has just a few jagged bones for teeth and faces a bill for more than £ 15,000 to repair her smile			1
but she has been left powerless to get compensation for the botched treatment because the private dentist who gave her dental implants in @entity13 in january 2010 has since moved to @entity14 and been struck off			1
devastation : @entity16 says her confidence has been destroyed since a dentist left her looking ' like a monster ' following botched operation to dental implants she said : ‘ i have been left looking like a monster			1
i ’m embarrassed when i talk			0
‘ i feel like people are staring at me			0
my confidence has been affected , my speech has been affected , i ca n’t eat solid food and nobody does you justice			0
‘ to be left like this , you ca n’t believe it can happen in this country			2
there ’s nothing i can do			0
i have a mortgage to pay and bills			0
i can not afford to fix this			0
i do n’t want other people to fall in to this situation			0
’ the work had been undertaken by self - employed dentist @entity41			1
dr @entity41 ’s licence to practise has been suspended by the @entity44 ‘ for protection of the public and in the public interest ’ - in relation to care of several patients			1
@entity4 , from @entity50 , @entity51 , said : ‘ i went back to the clinic but they said the dentist is self - employed and it ’s his responsibility , his insurance will pay			1
anger : a legal loophole has left the mother of one unable to get compensation to help meet the £ 15,000 bill to repair her damaged teeth ‘ then you go backwards and forwards , investigating and investigating			1
’ a letter from @entity4 ’s lawyers last year stated they are unable to pursue her case due to dr @entity41 ’s indemnity status			1
it stated that although dr @entity41 had insurance at the time of the treatment ‘ the policy was not adequate to cover claims made after the relevant insurance period had expired ’			2
they said she would have to enforce any judgement against him in @entity14 , which was unlikely to be successful			2
the mother of one from @entity82 , @entity51 , claims dozens of other people may also be victims of this legal loophole			1
@entity4 , who works as an area manager for a holiday home cleaning company , has been fighting for two years for the money to put things right			1
she is among campaigners calling for immediate change to laws which can leave patients powerless if dentists have no insurance , move abroad or refuse to contact their insurers			0
@entity4 opted for private treatment because she thought it would be the cheapest option after spending years saving the £ 4,125 needed for dental implants			1
fight : @entity4 is calling for immediate change to laws to help patients get compensation if dentists have no insurance , move abroad or refuse to contact their insurers she had previously had her upper teeth removed due to chronic root - canal infections because of an underlying health condition			1
a denture in her lower jaw was also failing			0
she had the dental implants - four metal rods in her upper gum			0
a bridge of teeth was to be attached at a later date			0
the procedure failed and @entity4 also lost her lower denture			2
@entity4 is backing national campaign ‘ @entity121 ’ , launched by the @entity122 , which calls for changes in the law			2
she has approached mp @entity125 who has written to secretary of state for health , @entity127 about the issue			0
mr @entity125 , mp for @entity130 and @entity131 , said : ‘ i ’m horrified by what has happened to @entity4 and am very supportive of her case			2
‘ we have got to try and close this legal loophole because people rightly expect when they go to a dentist , to be treated properly			1
’ @entity4 ’s work was carried out at the @entity140 in @entity141 near @entity142			2
@entity143 , of @entity140 , said dr @entity41 was self - employed and money would have to come through his insurers			2
he said : ‘ we are sympathetic towards her plight and emphasise the real need for a change in law in this country regarding indemnity insurance			0
’ he said since dr @entity41 returned to @entity14 in may 2010 he has not replied to contact from the clinic , his indemnity insurers , the @entity154 , @entity155 , or the @entity44 , @entity44			1
he said the clinic is absolutely disgusted with the indemnity insurer ’s stance and believe the @entity44 should apply more pressure			0
a @entity44 spokeswoman said that dr @entity41 has been struck off the @entity44 ’s register so he can not work legally in the @entity162			2
a misconduct hearing found ‘ wide - ranging failings of mr @entity41 ’s practice including the planning and execution of treatment , aftercare , a failure to obtain informed consent and failings in the manner in which he has dealt with complaints and enquiries as to his indemnity cover ’			0
the spokeswoman said : ‘ while we are sympathetic to the situation @entity4 finds herself in , it is important to note that we do not have the powers to award compensation - that is a matter for the courts - nor do we have powers to make insurance providers co-operate with solicitors			1
’ a @entity155 spokesperson said they were unable to comment about individual cases or the issue in general			0
the @entity192 has said it aims to have a consultation on indemnity cover for all health professionals in the autumn , and it is likely that legislation will be amended .			0

@entity4 , 48 , was left with a few jagged bones for teeth after bungled dental implant operation
