by @entity0 @entity2 users love – or loathe – @entity3 , the ‘ intelligent personal assistant ’ that recognises voice commands			1
and so far @entity7 owners have had to live without a similar feature to the one that @entity10 rolled out in october 2011			0
but a video that claims to show @entity13 ’s forthcoming digital assistant has been leaked online			1
it is expected to be unveiled next month and is rumoured to feature a swipe - down notification centre and the @entity3 - like personal assistant , according to @entity26			1
the digital assistant is expected to be called @entity18 and this video leak adds weight to the rumour			1
@entity18 is said to be poised to replace @entity31			1
just like @entity10 's @entity3 , users will be able to talk to it and ask questions			0
the assistant has a start - up process that asks users lots of questions to tailor its suggestions from the onset			0
@entity21 is expected to make its debut at the @entity41 in april , where it is rumoured that @entity43 will also launch two new @entity7 handsets			2
the @entity46 video shows @entity13 's assistant , called @entity18 , running on what seems to be a @entity21 handset			2
@entity13 describes the personal assistant as ‘ a personal assistant on your phone , ready to help with reminders , suggestions , tasks and lots more ’			1
@entity18 seems to make use of location , voice input , text messages email information and contacts as well as browser and search history to learn about a user ’s habits after they sign into their @entity13 account			0
it asks questions such as ‘ what are a couple of the most enjoyable parts of your everyday evenings ? ’ and ‘ when you think about food , what ’s most important to you these days ? ’ so it can offer tailored suggestions			0
this set - up feature is different to @entity10 ’s @entity3 or @entity81 ’s now , which asks questions to tweak suggestions later on instead of asking a user ’s preferences from the outset			2
@entity18 seems to make use of location , voice input , text messages email information and contacts as well as browser and search history to learn about a user 's habits , after they sign into their @entity13 account			0
after learning all it can about a user , the digital assistant offers its services ( pictured ) if the video is to be believed , @entity18 only kicks in when a person asks it to , either by accessing the assistant from the start screen or at the press of the search button			2
the website claims that the assistant is still ‘ a work in progress ’ so its appearance may change			0
