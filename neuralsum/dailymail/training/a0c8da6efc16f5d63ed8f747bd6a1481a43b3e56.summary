the final afternoon at @entity0 in 2012 , and the scoreboard for the first time is showing an ocean of @entity5 blue			1
captain @entity6 is waiting on the 12th tee for @entity8 , who is in the third - last match out			1
‘ do you know , i think we can win this , ’ said the @entity10 to his most experienced player , with tears in his eyes			2
and @entity8 is thinking : ‘ oh @entity18 , this is just what i need to see			1
’ a slimline @entity8 watches his drive as he prepares for his ninth @entity22 at the @entity23 the @entity5 team celebrate their against all odds victory in 2012 in the so - called miracle of @entity0 at home in @entity29 , there are photographs of some of @entity8 ’s great moments during an immense @entity22 career stretching back to 1997			1
there ’s one highlighting a wonderful putt he holed to snatch a half in a fourballs match in @entity39 in 2004 alongside @entity40			1
there are pictures detailing some of the fine partnerships he ’s forged along the way with @entity46 , sir @entity47 and the aforementioned @entity40			1
but what happened in 2012 , and a singles match largely overlooked because of the drama happening elsewhere , deserves its own consideration			2
for this was the first of his eight @entity53 where @entity8 was not playing the role of ‘ thou shalt not pass ’			1
he was struggling with his game			0
now here he was , all square in a match against @entity59 with his captain laying it all on the line			1
@entity8 ( r ) pulled off an important singles win against @entity59 ( @entity65 ) at the 2012 @entity22 captain @entity6 ( r ) embraces @entity8 after returning from victory on @entity68 soil since his 1997 debut , @entity8 has earned 21 points and been a key man in six victorious @entity22 teams			1
he has been on the losing side twice			0
@entity74 singles 8 3 5 0 foursomes 15 7 4 4 fourballs 14 8 4 2 total 37 18 13 6 ‘ i knew i needed to put my foot down and get the momentum in this game , and i did , ’ he recalled			0
‘ i won the 12th and the 13th and then he holed from about 30ft for a half on 14			0
but i won the 15th and now i was three up with three to play			0
it was nice to turn it on when it was needed			0
’ it ’s also something he can draw upon as he contemplates a ninth appearance at @entity90 next week , following a season where there have been few sightings of his awesome ball - striking of old			1
but you would struggle to find many among the rank and file on the @entity99 who would not have given him a wild card , even allowing for the fierce competition offered by @entity104			2
@entity106 @entity105 offered a typical view , saying : ‘ i ’d go for @entity108 every time			2
you need to hit it long and straight up there and it ’s a course that will suit him rather than , say , @entity104			0
’ @entity8 has forged some formidable @entity22 partnerships , most recently with @entity40 @entity8 has hinted that he could partner @entity115 rookie @entity114 at @entity90 unless something goes wrong during the practice days expect @entity8 , 41 , to partner @entity115 rookie @entity114 in the fourballs on friday morning			1
‘ @entity119 ( @entity120 ) and i have discussed the possibility of me being paired with the rookies , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s a role i ’ve been playing in the last two or three matches ( @entity125 in 2010 , @entity126 in 2012 ) and would happily take on again			2
‘ that first day is tough for them , and not too many get to play on the first morning			0
but if you have to go through it , it helps to be alongside an experienced player			0
@entity8 was grateful he could rely on the experience of partner @entity47 at @entity134 in 1997 ' i remember playing on the first morning at @entity134 in 1997 and it was one of those moments where you ’re shaking so hard you ’re wondering if you can get the ball to stay on the tee			1
it helped to have @entity47 ( @entity47 ) as my partner			1
he told me to play aggressively and not to worry about messing up , that he ’d be there			0
hopefully i ’m a similar mentor			0
‘ the first couple of @entity53 go by in a complete blur			0
now i enjoy it a lot more			0
it ’s an enormous privilege , and the more you play in , the more you can slow it down and take it all in			0
’ having played in @entity53 in @entity106 , @entity23 and @entity150 , he will next week become the first player to complete the set in @entity153			2
he ’s witnessed the two greatest comebacks from both a winning and losing point of view — @entity0 last time , @entity157 in 1999 — and was hugely influential in record victories on @entity68 and @entity5 soil in 2004 and 2006			1
has he got another great @entity22 left in him ? @entity162 's @entity161 ponders why @entity163 has rarely shown his greatness at the @entity22			2

@entity5 meet @entity68 in the @entity22 at @entity90 on *september* 26 - *28*
@entity8 will be playing in his ninth competition
former world no 1 has had *successful* partnerships with @entity47 , @entity46 and @entity40
@entity106 scored an important point against @entity59 at @entity0
@entity8 has hinted he could partner @entity115 rookie @entity114
