turtles may look like the hard - shelled relatives of lizards and snakes , but their dna suggests they have far more in common with birds			2
this is according to @entity8 scientists who used a new genetic sequencing technique called @entity10 ( @entity11 ) to finally settle the debate on turtle evolution			1
the results , they say , reveal that turtles belong to a large group called ' @entity18 , ' along with their relatives birds , crocodiles and dinosaurs			1
turtles may look like the hard - shelled relatives of lizards and snakes , but their dna suggests they have far more in common with birds scientists at the @entity26 suspect the new group will be the largest group of vertebrates to ever receive a new scientific name			1
their ' tree of life ' is consistent with the time and space patterns in which turtle species appear in the fossil record , highlighting the accuracy of the method			1
' @entity36 , including birds , and crocodilians are @entity39			0
turtles are called chelonians , ' dr @entity40 , a co-author told @entity43			0
' hence the new name we coined for the group that includes turtles , dinosaurs and crocodilians : @entity49			2
' although @entity11 has been available for two years , this is the first time the scientists have used the tool to genetically map vertebrates and how they are related			0
it works by analysing parts of the genome that are highly conserved between different species			0
scientists at the @entity26 suspect the new group - which includes birds , dinosaurs and turtles - will be the largest group of vertebrates to ever receive a new scientific name the findings also resolve an evolutionary mystery surrounding soft - shell turtles ( pictured ) - a bizarre group of scale-less turtles with snorkel - like snouts			1
until now , studies linked softshell turtles with a smaller semi-aquatic group called mud turtles researchers have long argued over how the turtle got its shell - and a fossil last year finally revealed the ' missing link '			1
the oldest known fossil turtle dated back about 210 million years , but it had an already fully formed shell , giving no clues to early shell evolution			0
last year , researchers revealed that @entity84 , a @entity86 species that existed 260 million years ago , has large broadened ribs that researchers believe eventually formed a shell			0
the researchers say the first clue came in 2008 when the 220 million - year - old fossil remains of an early turtle species , @entity94 , were discovered in @entity95			2
it had a fully developed plastron ( the belly portion of a turtle 's shell ) , but only a partial carapace made up of distinctively broadened ribs and vertebrae on its back			0
with this knowledge the scientists turned to newly discovered specimens of @entity84 , a @entity86 species 40 million years older than @entity108 that also had distinctively broadened ribs			0
their detailed study of @entity84 suggests it represents one of the first species to form the evolutionary branch of turtles			2
' calling this is an exciting new era of sequencing technology is an understatement , ' says @entity119 , phd , director of the @entity26 's @entity120 ( @entity120 )			0
' in the space of just five years , reasonably affordable studies using dna sequencing have advanced from using only a handful of genetic markers to more than 2,000 - an unbelievable amount of @entity122			2
' new techniques like @entity11 dramatically improve our ability to help resolve decades - long evolutionary mysteries , giving us a clear picture of how animals like turtles evolved on our constantly - changing planet			0
' the findings also resolve an evolutionary mystery surrounding soft - shell turtles - a bizarre group of scale-less turtles with snorkel - like snouts			1
until now , studies linked softshell turtles with a smaller semi-aquatic group called mud turtles , despite the fact that softshells appear in the fossil record long before their mud - loving counterparts			1
the @entity26 's study places softshells in a league of their own on the evolutionary tree , quite far removed from any turtle relatives			1
their long independent history helps explain their striking looks as well as their ancient presence in the fossil record			2
with large amounts of data backing up each evolutionary branch on the turtle tree of life , scientists are able to compare their evolution not only across species , but also across each continent 's corresponding fossil records			1
' i have been working on the evolutionary relationships of turtles for over 20 years using a variety of methods , ' said co-author dr @entity40			0
' fossils are essential for showing us what extinct turtles looked like , but also in letting us know when and where they lived in the past			0
' the results reveal that turtles belong to a large group called ' @entity18 , ' along with their relatives birds , crocodiles and dinosaurs , such as @entity188 ( pictured )			1

scientists used a new genetic sequencing technique to map relatives
the results , they say , reveal that turtles belong to a large group called ' @entity18 , ' along with their relatives birds , crocodiles and dinosaurs
this is consistent with when turtle species appear in the fossil record
study also resolves evolutionary mystery surrounding softshell turtles
until now , studies had linked softshell turtles with aquatic mud turtles
new study places softshells within their own on the evolutionary tree
