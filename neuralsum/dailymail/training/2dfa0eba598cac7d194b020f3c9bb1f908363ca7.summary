a @entity1 mp caught up in an internet sex scandal is to quit the @entity3 – after a second woman revealed he had sent her explicit personal pictures			1
in the latest blow to @entity11 after thursday ’s stunning @entity6 by - election victory in @entity8 , @entity9 last night said that he will step down at the next election			1
his announcement comes a fortnight after he was revealed to have sent explicit photos of himself to a male reporter posing as a woman			1
if repeated in a general election , it would see @entity6 win a staggering 128 seats , taking more than 100 from the @entity1 , and leaving @entity35 holding the balance of power			1
when he quit as charities minister last month after admitting sending obscene photos to ‘ @entity40 ’ , who he thought was a twentysomething @entity1 pr girl , @entity37 mp mr @entity9 vowed to hold on to his @entity44 seat			1
however , his latest humiliation has forced to him to quit politics altogether			1
in an astonishing and emotional public confession in today ’s @entity26 , he writes : ‘ in response to what seems to be a new text - and - tell story i am standing down as an mp at the next election			1
he was forced to resign as a minister last month after admitting sending obscene photos to ‘ @entity40 ’ , who he thought was a @entity1 pr girl ‘ i was the man who had everything ... now my political career is in ruins			1
‘ i have traumatised my family and let down my constituents and my colleagues			1
@entity64 will regard me as a failure			1
and it is true : behind the outward facade of success and achievement , i have been battling demons – and losing to them			1
’ in his resignation letter to the prime minister , the 56 - year - old married father of five said : ‘ the continued media intrusion into past episodes in my personal life is placing an intolerable burden on my family			1
i have therefore decided to stand down at the @entity33			2
‘ i will continue to serve my constituents to the best of my abilities until that time			2
i again appeal to the media to respect my family ’s privacy and to give me a chance to try to heal the hurt i have caused them			2
’ his first humiliating resignation as a minister coincided with the defection of @entity1 mp @entity90 to @entity6 and overshadowed the start of the @entity1 conference in @entity93			1
today ’s @entity95 poll will shake @entity96 , which is gearing up for a brutal fight in next month ’s @entity98 by - election caused by mr @entity90 ’s defection			1
the most astonishing mea culpa you will ever read , by @entity9 i was the man who had everything			1
i made a fortune , married a beautiful wife , had five children , and then fulfilled my lifelong ambition			2
ever since my school days i wanted to be a politician			1
my election to represent my @entity44 constituency of @entity37 in 2005 was one of the proudest moments of my life			1
so too was joining the government as @entity118			2
the mp said : ' now my political career is in ruins			1
i have traumatised my family and let down my constituents and my colleagues			2
many will regard me as a failure ' now my political career is in ruins			2
i have traumatised my family and let down my constituents and my colleagues			2
many will regard me as a failure			2
and it is true : behind the outward facade of success and achievement , i have been battling demons – and losing to them			2
i craved adrenaline and risk			2
stress at work drove me to increasingly erratic behaviour			2
my friends warned me that i was cracking up			2
late at night , i began a series of flirtations in response to approaches from women on social media			2
deep inside , i knew i was playing with fire			0
now it has consumed me and my family			0
when a newspaper exposed one of these episodes – involving a male freelance reporter using stolen pictures to impersonate a young female @entity1 activist – i stood down as a minister			1
now , in response to what seems to be a new text - and - tell story , i am standing down as an mp at the next election			1
i want to concentrate on slaying those demons – making me , i hope , a better husband and father , and giving me a chance to contribute in some way to the country in future			0
true , i made big sacrifices for my career , leaving a highly paid job in finance to dedicate myself to the day - to - day concerns of my constituents in @entity37			1
many of my counterparts from @entity178 and @entity179 days mocked me for this			0
i tried to explain to them that i wanted to give back : using my privilege and education to help people solve their daily problems – helping them navigate the bureaucratic maze on issues such as welfare and housing , and ensuring that @entity37 had its own community hospital			0
what is the point of making millions when you can change the lives of thousands ? but a far greater price was paid by my family			0
all too often i was an absent dad , arriving home late at night when the children were in bed			0
i missed family meals , holidays and vital moments in their lives			0
i will never get those back			0
worse , i was emotionally absent , seeking the buzz of achievement when i should have been dealing with the concerns of those nearest and dearest to me : my wife above all			0
the illusion of success in the @entity214 bubble blinded me to reality			0
exchanging flirty pictures online is no substitute for the love and companionship that a real marriage offers			1
i still look back with pride on my campaign to reduce youth unemployment , setting up an education charity in @entity225 and my efforts to encourage women into public life			0
amid the wreckage of my political career , it is some comfort to know that this work was not in vain			0
these causes will remain close to my heart and i will do what i can to further them even when i am no longer in @entity238			0
mr @entity9 meeting president @entity240 of @entity241			1
the mp admitted that stress at work drove him to increasingly erratic behaviour and he began a series of flirtations online i will continue to represent my constituents until the @entity33 in may			1
but i am seeking help now			0
i will be beginning residential psychiatric treatment for the next few weeks in the hope that professional help will enable me to salvage my life and my family			1
i would like to use this terrible moment in my life to appeal to others who are ashamed of their mental ill - health to seek help before it is too late			1
i have long argued in @entity238 against the stigma which we too often attach to mental illness			0
but i did not practise what i preached			0
i talked about my anorexia as a teenager , yet i was never brave enough to admit first that i was suffering from depression , or that i was lapsing into episodes of behaviour that any normal person would regard as bizarre and abhorrent			1
i realise now – too late – that i need treatment			1
many of my friends have advised me to ‘ tough this out ’			0
after all , they say , i have not broken any law			0
i have not stolen any money			0
many other politicians have done far worse things to their families – and their careers have survived and even flourished			0
i have received countless messages of support – from all political quarters and none – along these lines in recent days , and i am profoundly grateful for them			0
but for me that is not the point			0
i do not want to be a battle - scarred veteran of @entity214 politics			1
i want to be a person who brings happiness to those around me – and thus to myself			0
that can come only if i change			0
i do not blame the media for my downfall			0
it is for others to judge their behaviour and their ethics			0
the fault is mine alone			0
if i had sought help earlier , none of this would have happened			0
but i do hope that the media will leave me and my family alone as we try to rebuild our lives .			0
