by @entity0 @entity1 has lived in the @entity2 since he was ten years old , having entered illegally with his family , and is now married to an @entity2 with whom he has two children			1
still , he lives in fear of being deported to his native @entity7 at any given time , having already suffered one close shave which nearly tore his family apart , an experience he writes about for @entity11			1
in 2011 , mr @entity1 was arrested and charged with identity theft - having ' made up ' a social security number in order to gain employment - and spent 90 days in county jail while his wife was pregnant with their first child			1
fragile future : @entity1 ( right ) has lived in the @entity2 illegally since he was ten years old , and has an @entity2 wife , @entity21 ( left ) , and two children ( pictured ) he is afraid he might be separated from ' after years of complicated legal issues , i live in limbo , ' he says of his release from prison three years ago			1
' the authorities could reopen my case and order my deportation at any time			0
' mr @entity1 's life in @entity2 begun when he was smuggled across the border from @entity32 , @entity7 - a dangerous region fraught with drug wars - to @entity34 , @entity35 as a ten - year - old boy , along with his siblings and mother			1
he says he remembers very little about the journey but recalls his family 's excitement at the prospect of being reunited with his father , a construction worker who had been working in @entity35 illegally for several months			2
mr @entity1 admits that while growing up he was aware his family was ' undocumented ' , he did n't comprehend the full weight of that status until he reached high school			0
choices : after growing up knowing he was ' different ' mr @entity1 ( pictured with @entity21 ) ' made up ' a social security number to gain employment and was caught and sent to prison for 90 days ' i started to feel pretty bad about myself , like i was n’t good enough , because i was n’t like the other kids , ' he says			1
' i could n’t ask a girl out on a date , because i could n’t drive			0
what if she wanted to see an r - rated movie , and i did n’t have the proper @entity58 to go ? ' regardless , mr @entity1 tried to live as normal a life as possible , making up a fake social security number , which ' did n't belong to anyone else ' he points out , in order to score a job as a bartender			1
' i started to feel pretty bad about myself , like i was n’t good enough , because i was n’t like the other kids ' he also worked hard as a volunteer for a charity , @entity66 , where he mentored ' at - risk ' high school students , and where he ended up meeting his wife , @entity21			0
not long after the happy couple had saved enough money to buy their first home , the infamous sheriff @entity69 - known for his raids on restaurants to expose illegal immigrants , and for once arresting a six - year - old girl - tracked mr @entity1 down and sent him to jail			0
worry : due to his conviction , mr @entity1 ca n't apply for citizenship via any of the usual routes , like through his marriage , and he lives in fear that he could be deported at any time he says it was the day his ' world ended '			2
with the help of a good lawyer , mr @entity1 was released from jail in time for his son 's birth and put on a ' home - monitoring program			2
' ' if i ’m sent back to @entity32 , my children wo n’t have their father by their side , and my wife wo n’t have the support she needs and deserves ' he has since welcomed his second child , a daughter , and is now an advocate for an immigration reform ; meeting with members of @entity102 to share his story			2
he is unable to apply for citizenship through his marriage - a common route - or through the government 's @entity107 ( @entity107 ) program due to his previous conviction for using falsified documents to work			0
mr @entity1 is one of an estimated 11.5 million ' unauthorized immigrants ' residing in the @entity2 , according to the @entity112			0
of that number , over 600,000 illegal immigrants were forcibly deported in 2102 , the latest figure available , and mr @entity1 is still terrified that he could join that statistic			1
' if i ’m sent back to @entity32 , my children wo n’t have their father by their side , and my wife wo n’t have the support she needs and deserves , ' he says			0
' who could ever call that justice ? '			0
