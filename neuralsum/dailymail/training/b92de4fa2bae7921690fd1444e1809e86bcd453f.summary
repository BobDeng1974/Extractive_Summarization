two weeks passed before they found @entity1 - still slumped forward , as he had died , on his knees in a remote patch of @entity5 woodland			1
he had been bludgeoned and stabbed up to ten times in the neck			2
his fallen glasses were smeared with grime and his body had been picked at by animals			2
in its own twisted way , it had been a crime of passion			0
@entity1 's wife , @entity17 , had convinced her boyfriend that he had to prove his love by killing the man she said stood in their way			1
it 's difficult to imagine a more cold - blooded means for a wife to have her husband dispatched , and next monday , @entity27 will pay the ultimate price for her sins			1
death row : @entity27 ( pictured ) will become the first woman to be executed in @entity5 since 1945 conspiring : she convinced her lover @entity33 to kidnap and stab her husband @entity1 ( pictured ) to death murderous partners : @entity17 ( left ) arrived at the woods while her boyfriend @entity38 ( right ) was killing her husband and helped set his car on fire to destroy any forensic evidence the first woman to be executed in @entity5 since 1945 , she has languished on @entity30 for 17 years , the only female			1
lack of exercise and a prison diet put paid to the pretty face and slim figure that once drew men to her			2
@entity1 , who is 46 , has already chosen a last meal of cornbread , two cheese burgers , two large portions of chips , cherry vanilla ice - cream , popcorn , salad with buttermilk and lemonade to wash it all down			1
that is just one of the rituals for condemned prisoners on their final day			0
there is a last meeting with loved ones and supporters , a talk with a spiritual adviser and the preparation of the last words			0
then , finally , watched through a glass window by a small group of the victim 's relatives and local media witnesses , she will be strapped to a stretcher in a small execution chamber			0
at that point , she will be allowed to deliver a few sentences before she is injected with a cocktail of chemicals designed to put her to sleep painlessly and then stop her heart			0
there is , however , no guarantee the process will go smoothly , given recent scandals over injections which left @entity30 prisoners in agony for prolonged periods before they died			0
what makes this execution the subject of such fascination , however , is the fact it is a woman who is being legally killed			0
locked up : @entity1 , who will be the first woman to be executed in @entity5 in 70 years , ordered a massive ' last meal ' consisting over 2,400 calories @entity17 will become the first woman to get the death penalty in @entity5 since @entity104 , who was executed in 1945 after being convicted of killing her employer inevitably , executing female prisoners poses unique ethical quandaries			1
experts say juries are often reluctant to send women to @entity30			0
one in ten suspects arrested for murder in @entity113 are women , but only one in 50 of those given death sentences and just one in 100 of the prisoners who are eventually executed is female			1
equally , there is a counter-argument that in the most heinous murder cases , the jurors can feel such disgust at a woman 's involvement that their gender can work against them			1
that appears to have been so at @entity27 's trial			1
another twist in the case has deeply troubled legal experts			0
for while the mother - of - three was sentenced to death , her former lover @entity33 - the man who actually carried out the killing - escaped with a life sentence that could see him out of prison less than ten years from now			1
after accepting a controversial plea deal to testify against his partner in crime , @entity33 admitted his guilt and helped prosecutors portray @entity1 as the case 's @entity140 - with her suggesting the murder , planning it and urging him to do it			1
he might have been ' the bullet ' , as the lead prosecutor liked to phrase it , but she was ' the gun '			0
death penalty : @entity17 will be executed on monday but her then - boyfriend who killed her husband was handed a life sentence and could be free within the next decade broken family : @entity17 's three children ( two pictured ) - now grown up - were fathered by different men of whom @entity1 was one the court heard how @entity17 was born to a poor cotton farmer father and a mother who now works as a prison officer , and was sexually abused as a child by a string of men			1
they included an uncle and even her stepfather , who slept with the then ten - year - old girl for six months under the pretence of helping her get used to a new bed			0
when she grew up and married @entity1 , their relationship was a rocky one			2
between 1989 and 1996 they married , divorced , remarried , separated and reunited			0
her three children , now grown up , were fathered by different men — one of whom was @entity1			2
both @entity177 spent periods in the @entity179 , and @entity17 even worked briefly as a prison officer			0
they moved to @entity181 , @entity5 , in december 1996			2
but @entity1 did n't know that his wife had found a boyfriend — @entity33 — while they had been separated			1
she rekindled that relationship after she returned to @entity1			2
@entity33 said he had suggested she divorce @entity1 , but she insisted her husband would never leave her alone			1
she also appears to have anticipated a decent pay - out from his life insurance policy			2
so it was that she hatched a plot to be rid of him			0
chilling past : the court heard how @entity17 ( pictured ) was born to a poor cotton farmer father and a mother who now works as a prison officer - and was sexually abused as a child by a string of men one evening in february 1997 , @entity17 drove @entity33 to her home and gave him a truncheon and a large hunting knife			1
she left him inside , waiting for her husband to return , while she went off to dance at a local bar			0
@entity1 , who had spent the evening helping friends from their local church repair their car , got back at 11.30pm			2
@entity33 surprised him and drove him - at knifepoint - to a remote wooded area , before walking him deep among the trees and ordering him to kneel down			1
first removing his victim 's watch and wedding ring - to make it look like a robbery - he knocked @entity216 out with a blow from the truncheon and then stabbed him repeatedly			1
@entity17 arrived at the woods while the killing was in progress and , afterwards , helped set fire to @entity33 's car to destroy any forensic evidence			1
the following morning , she raised the alarm over her missing husband , even playing the worried wife in tv appeals			0
by the time police found the body , she had discovered to her fury that his life insurance policy was worth only around £ 6,000			2
following the murder , police and friends were struck by @entity17 's apparent lack of emotion , but her biggest mistake had been telling friends she had a boyfriend			1
police discovered @entity33 's connection to her and arrested the pair two days after the funeral			1
both were told they faced the death penalty unless they accepted a plea deal - testifying against each other in return for a life sentence with no chance of parole for 25 years			1
@entity1 refused , but @entity33 agreed , and a jury convicted her of murder with malice in 1998			1
statistics show that @entity257 's case is almost unique in @entity113 's grim history of capital punishment			0
for example , of the 1,402 murderers executed since the @entity261 , only five were conspirators ( rather than the actual killer )			0
though she is desperate to live , there is no doubt @entity1 has faced a miserable existence for a long time			2
as the only woman on @entity30 in her state , she has lived in complete segregation from other inmates in a women 's prison outside @entity274			1
she spends 15 hours a day in a 9ft by 12ft cell with a six - by - nine - inch window			0
her meals are slid through a hatch three times a day , and whenever she needs to leave her room , even to have a shower , she is handcuffed			0
' i deserve to be here , but i do n't deserve to die , ' she said ten years ago			0
' how can you justify me being here when [ her former boyfriend @entity33 ] could be walking the streets one day ? ' in previous clemency applications , clergymen and prison officials described her as a changed woman , a ' truly redeemed person ' who had genuinely found @entity290			1
even her children said they have forgiven her and wanted her life spared			0
the same people made last - ditch pleas to the state 's board of pardons and parole at a hearing on tuesday , with officials saying that @entity1 had now become a committed @entity301			1
although not present at the hearing , she said in a statement : ' there are no excuses for what i did			0
i will never understand how i let myself fall into such evil			0
' however , with the victim 's family joining prosecutors in opposing clemency , calls to halt the execution have fallen on deaf ears			0
in truth , she always had little chance in such a hardline state : in january , @entity5 executed a decorated @entity319 veteran for murdering a policeman , despite evidence he had been affected by post-traumatic stress disorder			1
the next execution was of a man with an iq of only 70			0
yesterday morning , the parole board ruled that @entity1 should indeed be executed			2
she will be moved from her women 's prison to a men 's facility , the @entity331 , 114 miles away , where she is to be put to death in its small execution block			2
there seems little doubt of her guilt , even if her punishment raises many questions			0
the last woman to be executed in @entity5 , 70 years ago - in an age of open racial prejudice - was a black maid named @entity104 who killed her employer			1
she claimed he had tried to imprison her , and she had acted in self - defence			0
nine years ago , the same pardons and parole board which heard @entity1 's final appeal gave @entity104 a full posthumous pardon			1
but for the woman who ordered her husband to be slaughtered like an animal in the woods , there is to be no mercy .			2
