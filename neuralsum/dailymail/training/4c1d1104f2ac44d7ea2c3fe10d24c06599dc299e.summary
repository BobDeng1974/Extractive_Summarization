the former radio 1 dj behind the ‘ @entity1 ’ has denied it is racist – because some of his friends are from the @entity5			1
@entity6 said the @entity8 anthem , sung in a @entity10 - accent warning of ‘ illegal immigrants in every town ’ , was just ‘ a bit of fun ’			1
he said : ‘ i do n't have a racist bone in my body			0
i work across all cultures and creeds , i travel the world			0
’ mr @entity6 added : i ’ve got so many chums out in the @entity5			1
i ’ve spent a lot of time out there			0
he told @entity32 : ‘ i thought oh my god , that 's not what i intended at all , i felt absolutely so low i can not tell you			0
‘ people are very very very quick to take offence now at something that years ago would have been deemed to be a bit of satire and a bit of fun			1
‘ but now with social media everybody can assume that you meant something appalling by it , which of course i did n’t			0
i was terribly hurt that people thought that			0
' the @entity49 added : ‘ at the time it was a bit of fun , and that ’s how you sing calypso			1
looking back on it , maybe i should n’t have done it like that , i should maybe sung it straight or whatever , but it was just meant to be a bit of fun , and the fact that people are taking it like that is abhorrent to me			1
‘ in hindsight maybe i should have done it in a straight accent or who knows ? ’ but @entity8 leader @entity29 , who has called for the song to go to number 1 in the charts , dismissed claims it was racist			1
mr @entity6 's song has sparked accusations of racism for using a mock @entity10 accent the song raises the issue of immigration with the lyrics : ‘ leaders committed a cardinal sin , open the borders let them all come in ' he said : " no , of course it ’s not [ racist ]			1
@entity80 has worked for the @entity32 for several decades , he ’s in fact one of your corporation ’s great stars , and he ’s made a calypso song , and he said himself if he was doing a @entity87 song , he ’d do @entity87 ’s accent			1
it is meant to be a bit of fun			1
" the song raises the issue of immigration with the lyrics : ‘ leaders committed a cardinal sin , open the borders let them all come in , illegal immigrants in every town , stand up and be counted @entity99 and @entity100			1
’ it continues : ‘ oh yes , when we take charge , and the new prime minister is @entity29 , we can trade with the world again – when @entity29 is at @entity106			1
’ other lyrics include digs at the @entity108 such as ‘ with the @entity108 we must be on our mettle , want to change our lawnmowers and our kettles			0
the @entity108 live in wonderland , tried to ban bent bananas and @entity119 jam , we do n't want jam the @entity108 way , jam yesterday tomorrow but never today			0
’ mr @entity6 , a former @entity123 supporter , also warns against trusting the prime minister , singing : ‘ the @entity119 people have been let down , that 's why @entity8 is making ground			1
from @entity127 to @entity128 , from @entity129 to @entity130 , they do n't believe @entity122 's referendum			0
‘ the other parties will count the cost , in @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 shaking in their boots when @entity8 kick them up the grass roots			1
’ the song also mentions mr @entity29 ’s love of ‘ fags and beer ’ and jokes about the frequency of his appearances on the @entity32 ’s @entity149			1
@entity8 ’s @entity151 spokesman @entity150 defended the song			1

‘ what he has done is fantastic and the pc brigade have to grow up and get with it			0
the guy has made a song			0

he hit the headlines in 1984 when he refused to play the @entity172 single , relax , because he objected to its lyrics			0
a @entity32 spokeswoman said mr @entity6 had not breached the corporation 's guidelines on impartiality by recording the song in support of the @entity182 party because he did not present a current affairs programme			1
the corporation added that the decision on whether to play the song was up to the discretion of individual programme producers			0
a @entity169 spokesman declined to comment on whether it would be played on if it enters the @entity192			0

anyway , is n't calypso music a bit foreign for @entity8 ? ’ another review said : ‘ a triumph			1

’ a further comment said : ‘ @entity158 , @entity29			2
’ some criticised mr @entity6 ’s accent on the song			1

’ ‘ @entity241 sick with faux @entity10 accent			0
shows @entity209 in its true light as a nasty racist party , ’ added another			2
in may , @entity8 had to cancel a ‘ carnival of colour ’ with a steel band in @entity246 after it descended into farce			2
the event was supposed to demonstrate the party welcomed members from all ethnic minorities , but rows broke out between supporters and demonstrators			2
the steel band stopped playing and packed up after they found out the event was in support of the party			0
