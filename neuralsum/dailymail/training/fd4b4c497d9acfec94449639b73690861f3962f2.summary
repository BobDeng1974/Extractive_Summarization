@entity0 are in discussions about taking @entity2 on a permanent deal after @entity4 failed to guarantee that the player would return to them at the end of the season			1
@entity9 striker @entity2 wanted to sign for @entity4 and had agreed personal terms but did not want to spend his time on loan elsewhere next season			1
@entity0 are now exploring the possibility of offering extra bonus payments to entice @entity2 for them			1
' this @entity21 rule wrecked the plan for @entity4 to sign @entity2 from @entity9 then loan him to @entity0 and complicated the move			1
but the rule only covers loan deals between @entity21 clubs			0
it would not have stopped @entity4 signing @entity2 and then loaning him abroad , as they did with @entity37 last january			1
@entity4 now seem to have backed out of the deal altogether , leaving @entity0 to pick up negotiations to sign him permanently			1
the player travelled to @entity42 on monday and is in discussions with both clubs			0
@entity4 had initially outlined an £ 8million deal that would see the player loaned to @entity0 for the rest of the season			1
but this has been complicated as @entity24 states the loan deal between the @entity21 clubs would not be allowed , preventing him from joining @entity0 immediately after signing for @entity4			1
@entity0 , who signed @entity54 from @entity4 last week , have been keen to back manager @entity55 in his bid to salvage their @entity21 status			1
that is evident in their pursuit of a striker			2
apart from their efforts to sign @entity2 , they have made an offer to @entity65 for @entity66 and have tabled an £ 8m bid for @entity68 forward @entity69			1
the @entity70 international has scored eight goals in 16 games this season but @entity68 want £ 10m for the 28 - year - old			0
@entity0 have also made a £ 7.5m offer for @entity77 at @entity78 and have had a £ 750,000 offer for @entity81 's @entity80 rejected			1
@entity54 has joined @entity0 as the club look to stay in the @entity21 @entity83 do not need to sell @entity84 to fund new signings			1
the 21 - year - old has been linked with @entity87 and @entity88 but the @entity42 club have no intention of bidding for the striker in january while the @entity92 are not planning to spend at this stage			1
@entity83 do n't need to sell striker @entity84 ( top ) to fund new signings @entity83 have not had an offer for @entity84 , who is valued at £ 25million , and he will stay at @entity83 barring any late change of plans but @entity98 still wants to add around three players			2
club record striker @entity100 could leave , however , as @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 have retained an interest despite his lack of goals since his £ 10m summer move from @entity108			0
@entity109 have played down the prospects of @entity111 joining @entity88 early from his season - long loan			1
@entity88 need a striker and have clubs showing interest in @entity116 and @entity117 but @entity118 has scored just four goals this season and is struggling to find the form that earned him a starting place for @entity124 at the @entity125			1
@entity111 is unlikely to join @entity88 in this transfer window being thrust into the spotlight at @entity128 where the pressure is greater is not seen as the wisest move			1
the player is keen to join but much may hinge on how @entity132 looks on his return to @entity134 this week and how his thigh holds up to training and games			0
@entity109 director @entity138 said : ' @entity118 to @entity88 now ? it would cost at least £ 4.7m but at the moment it is not possible			1

however , they have clubs hiking up the price thinking they are due more money from @entity88			2
@entity88 have yet to step up interest in @entity155 of @entity156 who is talking to @entity158 and @entity159 but are on the lookout for a cheap goalkeeper if they can find one			2
@entity88 have not stepped up their interest in @entity164 star @entity155 @entity165 are interested in @entity167 defender @entity166			2
the @entity168 international was a target for @entity170 in the summer but had already agreed a move to @entity172			0
now @entity170 is back in for @entity173 , a target for @entity175 and @entity88 in the past , who can play at centre - back and full - back			2
he has been capped on 26 occasions by his country and @entity165 will see if a deal can be done this month with @entity167 keen for cash			0
