' soldiers who went in , in very large numbers , for very short but very brutal incursions where they extra-judicially executed young men , burned down their homes			0
' those who they arrested were then tortured in detention			0
and that was really repeated in every town and every village that i visited			2
fighters : free @entity79 members , with covered faces and holding weapons , sit by the side of a street in the @entity85 district of @entity28 plea : @entity87 's foreign minister @entity86 ( left ) wants the @entity15 to make @entity89 's ( right ) peace plan obligatory ' the bulk , the overwhelming majority of the violations are being committed by the government security forces and their paramilitary militia against the civilian population			1
' a peace plan brokered by former @entity15 secretary - general @entity89 has failed to end bloodshed that has cost the lives of more than 10,000 people			1

i 've spoken about @entity5 on @entity175 , but mentioned nothing on my own website			1
' i am not intimidated by the attack and it has given me the chance to go back and redesign it as i was intending to do anyway			0
' the homepage was left with a black background , a picture of the brutal @entity5 leader , and the message it had been ' @entity186 '			1

it allows the use of military force			0
the first stage could be to impose a @entity203 and allow humanitarian aid into the country			2
but , as seen in other conflicts , it could escalate to more drastic action if the regime does n't bend to international demands			0
and echoing @entity15 peacekeeping chief @entity213 's comments the day before , he said the @entity5 conflict was now a ' civil war '			1
he said : ' we propose making the implementation of the @entity89 plan compulsory			0
