it is one of three events to be either dropped or altered at @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , after organisers cited health and safety concerns			1
show organisers took the ‘ bizarre ’ decision to drop both the ' highest frisbee jump ' and the ' highest biggest catch ' categories over fears the competing dogs could injure themselves			1
the @entity25 , which has named the town the @entity29 ’s most dog - friendly on two occasions , supported the decision			0
frisbee catching has been banned from @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 today on the grounds of health and safety amid fears the pets could strain or injure themselves when taking part ( file picture ) @entity37 , one of the show ’s organisers , said a third category – ' best biggest catcher ' – had also been toned down for safety reasons			1
instead of jumping to catch the biscuit , dogs will instead be sitting down when taking part			2
mr @entity37 said the decision was made after fellow organisers raised concerns about the competing dogs ’ wellbeing			1
he said : ‘ in shows elsewhere there have been occasions where dogs have jumped high and twisted their back , and there was one where the dog had to be put down			0
‘ the committee made the decision reluctantly , we were advised it was a better thing to do even though it sounds counterintuitive and bizarre			0
‘ i think we probably made the right decision , we just want to avoid any dogs getting hurt			2
‘ @entity65 and safety has finally hit dogs			2
’ organisers decided to drop both the ' highest frisbee jump ' and the ' highest biggest catch ' categories over fears the dogs could get hurt			1
more than 500 people are set to attend the show in @entity13 , @entity14 ( above ) the @entity25 endorsed the show 's decision			1
a spokesman said : ‘ @entity80 encourages fun sports and activities for dogs in order to keep them fit and healthy			0
‘ but it has concerns about the game of frisbee , particularly in its more extreme forms			0
‘ while it can be safe in controlled conditions , if it is thrown at great heights or awkward angles , leading the dog to jump and twist , it can cause strain and injury on landing so care should always be taken			0
’ more than 500 people are expected to descend on @entity99 in @entity13 today for the dog show , which will see 28 dogs taking part in 24 different categories			0
other categories will see prizes awarded to the dog with the most appealing eyebrows , the waggiest tail , the longest tongue and the one which most looks like its owner .			0

' highest biggest catch ' also dropped over health and safety concerns
