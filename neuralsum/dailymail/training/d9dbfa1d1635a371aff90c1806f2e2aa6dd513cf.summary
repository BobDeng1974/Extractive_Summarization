by @entity0 @entity2 's presidential popularity has dropped significantly since she launched a media blitz to promote her new book @entity5 , a poll taken over the weekend shows			1
the presumed 2016 presidential candidate still leads her likely @entity10 challengers by double digits , but her share of the vote dropped under 50 percent in the latest @entity15 poll			1
' some pundits suggest that it is good that former secretary of state @entity2 is airing her dirty linen and making her campaign mistakes now with over two years to go until the 2016 elections , ' pollster @entity16 said in a post on the company 's website			2
' others , me included , argue that this lackluster performance is not likely to go away			0
' @entity16 's findings echo @entity31 chairman @entity30 ' comments on sunday morning that voters are getting ' @entity2 fatigue			1
' former secretary of state @entity34 prepares to sign copies of her book @entity5 at a @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 on friday night @entity2 and @entity40 have been in the news nearly every day throughout the past month and a half as @entity2 geared up for and then launched her second memoir			1
much of the coverage of the former first family has not been favorable , as both heads of the @entity40 household have struggled to explain away issues with @entity2 health and the massive amount of money they 've added to their pocketbooks since departing the @entity54 a decade ago			1
@entity16 's poll intimates that the @entity57 ' many appearances throughout the last several months have done more to hurt @entity2 's chances in 2016 should she run for president than it has to help			1
in a hypothetical match - up against former @entity63 governor @entity62 , @entity16 found that @entity40 would win with 47 percent of the vote to @entity62 's 35 percent , and 12 percent of voters would select ' other '			1
only five percent of voters said they were n't sure who they would pick			0
while @entity40 still holds a commanding lead over @entity62 , support for the former secretary of state has dropped four points in the last month			2
in may she led him 49 -32			0
likewise , @entity40 would only beat @entity75 senator @entity74 by 12 points , down from 21 points in march and 17 points in may			2
she holds the most significant lead over embattled @entity81 governor @entity80 , whom she would beat by 15 points			0
even her edge over @entity80 , who has suffered through his own share of problems in the last year , has declined since march , dropping from 26 points in march to 16 points in may			0
@entity16 did not ask or would not say how @entity40 would fare against other rumored 2016 candidates			2
former @entity63 governor and prospective 2016 presidential candidate @entity62 , pictured here in february , is n't getting on @entity93 's nerves like @entity2 and @entity40 , @entity31 chair @entity30 observed on sunday , because he and his family have stayed fairly quiet over the last few months the latest @entity15 poll is consistent with the outcome of a recent @entity98 survey that found that found @entity40 would beat potential general election opponents by 11 - 14 points			1
only @entity74 came within striking distance of the @entity103 front - runner , and the right - leaning polling group found @entity40 would still win with seven points to spare			2
that poll tested @entity40 against @entity108 governor @entity107 , @entity108 sen. @entity109 and @entity63 sen. @entity110 , in addition to @entity74 and @entity80			2
it did not ask respondents about @entity62			0
on sunday , @entity10 head @entity30 postulated that @entity93 are already growing tired of the @entity40 ' show ' two and a half years out from the presidential election			1
' there ’s @entity2 fatigue out there			0
it ’s setting in , ' @entity30 said on @entity120			0
' and i just happen to believe that this early run for the @entity54 is going to come back and bite them			0
people are tired of it , ' he said			0
the reason @entity93 are not as sick of @entity62 , despite being part of the @entity62 political dynasty , is because he and his family are n't in the public eye as often as @entity40 and @entity2 , @entity30 told meet the press host @entity134			1
' i do n’t think @entity62 and the @entity136 are being as obnoxious , ' the @entity10 leader said .			0

the @entity57 have been in the news for a different reason every day since @entity2 's book blitz began in late may
much of the coverage about the former first family has not been favorable as both @entity40 and @entity2 have *stumbled* over questions about @entity2 's health and their *wealth*
now , @entity93 are getting what @entity31 chairman @entity30 calls ' @entity149 '
in hypothetical match - ups against other prospective 2016 presidential candidates , @entity2 would beat @entity10 contenders , but by an *increasing* *smaller* margin
