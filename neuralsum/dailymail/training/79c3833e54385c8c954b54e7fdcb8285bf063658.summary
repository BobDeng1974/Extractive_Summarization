her husband @entity14 , who was driving the black @entity15 , suffered shoulder and pelvic injuries but survived the crash on january 16 , 2010			2
@entity1 was today found guilty of failing in its duty of care by not installing an approach locking system which could have prevented the tragedy			2
signalman @entity24 was also found guilty of failing to take reasonable care for the health and safety of other people likely to be affected by his actions or omissions at work			1
tragedy : @entity8 was hit while crossing the track by car after @entity24 lifted the barriers too early @entity38 @entity37 heard how @entity24 had been distracted from his duties after he received a phone call from a farmer who asked permission to herd his flock of sheep across the tracks			1
it was then the 43 - year - old wrongly lifted the barriers because he thought the @entity49 to @entity51 train had already passed the crossing			0
@entity24 only realised his fatal mistake when he saw the train approaching at 80mph around the corner - when he frantically tried to lower the barriers and change the signal			2
the court heard that while human error was to blame for the crash , @entity1 bosses refused to spend £ 40,000 on a simple safety device that would have prevented the crash but were too concerned about the cost			1
the company was today found guilty of failing in its duty of care of the health and safety of railway and railway crossing users by not installing an approach locking system			0
signalman @entity24 was distracted by a call from a farmer asking if he could herd sheep across the tracks at @entity12 - on - @entity79 meanwhile , @entity24 was also found guilty of failing to take reasonable care for the health and safety of other people likely to be affected by his actions or omissions at work			1
during a three week trial , the jury were told @entity1 refused to install the safety system because it was too expensive			2
prosecutor @entity90 said : ' @entity1 took the decision not to install this device because it would cost £ 40,000 - that device could have saved a life			1
' an approach locking system has been around since the 1960s and can be used to stop signals being changed when trains are still coming through			0
' in 2009 there was quite a lot of work done at the @entity12 crossing and the barriers were replaced because the mechanism was getting old			0
' there were discussions to have an approach locking device which were rejected			0
smash : the court heard that a £ 40,000 safety device might have prevented the mother 's death ' why not put in this approach - locking device ? ' the reason was " money "			1
was the cost too great to avoid the cost of a human life ? ' the jury heard @entity24 became distracted when a farmer rang his signal box			2
mrs @entity8 was travelling with her husband @entity14 when their car was hit by the train on january 16 , 2010 in a police interview @entity24 said he lifted the barriers because he wrongly believed the train had already passed as cars were waiting at the crossing			1

speaking after the case , @entity143 , head of the @entity145 ’s @entity144 , said : ' @entity24 and @entity1 both played very different parts in the tragic death of @entity8			1
' mr @entity24 made a mistake in raising the level crossing barriers when a train was approaching			2
' whilst his was a momentary error , his failure to follow procedures and checks , as he had been trained to do , has rightly resulted in his conviction			0
' his employers , on the other hand , made a deliberate decision not to install a safety device which would have detected the oncoming train and kept the barriers down			1
that decision was based on cost			0
' it is right that an organisation that holds the safety of the public in its hands on a daily basis has been held to account for its decision making			0
' my thoughts are with mrs @entity8 ’s family and i hope that this result gives them some small measure of comfort			0
' judge @entity178 bailed @entity24 and ordered him to return to court for sentencing on april 10			0
