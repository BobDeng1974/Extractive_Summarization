@entity8 , 50 , was carrying two female passengers when he ditched onto the highway , but his wife @entity11 was not on the plane			1
and she does n't seem impressed with his antics			2
' why do n't you ask him ? i 'm sure he would be happy to tell you , ' she told @entity19 when asked about his pleasure flight			2
the pilot 's wife told the site she only found out about the excursion on saturday evening			1
but his wife was n't on the plane and does n't seem impressed with his exploits air traffic control tapes released on sunday shed light into the cockpit as student pilot @entity8 navigated his broken plane into a dramatic emergency landing on the busy @entity5 expressway			1
@entity8 had taken out two passengers , named as @entity43 , 43 , and @entity44 , 20 , for a trip around the @entity46 on saturday			2
then he encountered engine troubles on the way back to @entity49 , @entity50			2

crash : the small plane is pictured on a @entity5 highway after the pilot was forced to make an emergency landing owner : the plane is registered to @entity8 of @entity31 , @entity32			1
but his wife was n't on the plane and does n't seem impressed with his exploits in the call he asks for a place to make an emergency landing , and the air traffic controller points out that @entity75 in @entity76 is five miles away			1
' i 'll never make it , where do i touch down ? ' at that point the air traffic controller struggles for a while to think up another option ' i 'm not sure where you can touch down if you 're not going to make it , ' he says before throwing out the idea of @entity88 or @entity89			2
he quickly changes his mind on landing on the @entity89 however since its populated and points the pilot in the direction @entity94 which is 1,100 acres			0
by then it was too late			0
only option : the air traffic controller suggested landing in @entity94 , but mr @entity8 was too far off shock : after safely landing the plane , mr @entity8 reported back to @entity100 that the plane was in surprisingly good condition ' i 'm at less than 1,000 feet , ' @entity8 said just as he landed on the freeway			1
