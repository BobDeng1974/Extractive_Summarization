serious failings in @entity2 care for cancer patients have been laid bare by three separate reports			1
they reveal waiting times for scans are at their highest in seven years , there is an ' unacceptable ' postcode lottery in treatment and how @entity12 spends far less on new drugs than elsewhere in the western world			1
today the @entity2 will also announce which life - extending medications will be axed from its @entity17 because they are too expensive			1
@entity18 , which is used for bowel and ovarian cancers , is one of the drugs at risk of being cut meanwhile gps in the @entity25 have complained that @entity2 managers are delaying patients from having cancer tests to meet waiting times targets			1
as mps warned that cancer care on the @entity2 had been ' diluted ' and was ' going backwards ' , a string of reports revealed how : ÷ a total of 18,740 patients in january waited longer than six weeks for tests to diagnose cancer			1
the figure from @entity39 represents a 40 per cent increase in a year and the highest number since february 2008			1
÷ there is ' unacceptable ' and ' unexplained ' variation in cancer detection and treatment across @entity39 – particularly for the elderly			1
@entity47 emerged showing the @entity2 spends less on new cancer treatments than the @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			1
the report by data analysts blamed @entity55 , the medications rationing body , for turning down too many drugs which are not deemed ' cost - effective '			0
not all the patients waiting for screening , such as ct scans , x-rays and ultrasounds , will have cancer			1
however , it is crucial diagnosis happens as quickly as possible so any tumours found can be removed or treated before they spread			2
@entity69 mp @entity68 , who is chairman of the committee , said that despite the increasing numbers being diagnosed with cancer , the money being ploughed into the services had declined @entity12 has one of the worst cancer survival rates in @entity77 and this has partly been blamed on late diagnosis as well as lack of availability of effective treatments			1
a report by the @entity84 warned of a postcode lottery in cancer detection and treatment across @entity39			1
mps were particularly concerned about the care for older patients – the group most at risk of cancer – who are often denied chemotherapy or surgery as they are thought to be too frail			1
@entity97 , @entity69 's health spokesman , said : ' cancer care has gone backwards and patients are missing out on the treatment they need ' @entity100 ( cabazitaxel ) use : @entity102 prostate cancer			1
benefit : extends survival for an average of three months but some men have lived for three more years			0
cost : around £ 22,000			0
@entity107 ( aflibercept ) use : bowel cancer			2
benefit : gives six weeks extra survival			2
@entity18 ( bevacizumab ) use : bowel and ovarian cancers			0
benefit : prolongs life for between five and nine months			0
cost : £ 12,000 for bowel and £ 16,000 for ovarian cancer			0
@entity119 ( lapatinib ) use : breast cancer			0
benefit : four months extra survival			0
cost : £ 1,600 a month			0
@entity124 ( pemetrexed ) use : lung cancer			0
benefit : three months extra life			0
@entity129 ( trabectedin ) use : ovarian cancer			0
benefit : average survival increased by six months			0
@entity69 mp @entity68 , who is chairman of the committee , said that despite the increasing numbers being diagnosed with cancer , the money being ploughed into the services had declined			0
' focus on cancer has also been diluted at a local level , ' she said , adding : ' it is unacceptable that @entity143 does not understand the reasons why access to treatment and survival rates are considerably poorer for older people			2
' a report by the @entity150 – an international firm which analyses data around the world – reveals how the @entity2 in @entity39 spends less on new cancer treatments per patient compared to @entity52 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity51 , the @entity49 , @entity158 and @entity50			1
it allocates an average of £ 7,671 per new cancer patient compared to £ 16,661 , the highest of the ten countries			0
@entity162 , of @entity163 , said : ' cancer care in @entity39 is in urgent need of improvement			1
' @entity167 , of @entity168 , said : ' it is depressing that too many patients are waiting longer than they should			2
' @entity97 , @entity69 's health spokesman , said : ' cancer care has gone backwards and patients are missing out on the treatment they need			2
this slump in cancer standards is a scandal that needs to be stopped			0
' it comes as gps in the @entity25 have accused hospital managers of downgrading patients ' cancer risk to meet waiting time targets			2
it means that instead of being seen in two weeks , patients could have to wait up to six months			2
a letter obtained by @entity187 magazine reveals how @entity2 officials have written to hospitals in @entity190 and @entity191 warning them that the practice is ' inappropriate ' and ' against patients ' best interests '			1
the @entity196 claimed that waiting times for scans are increasing because more patients are being referred by @entity178			0
a spokesman said that five million more tests had been carried out last year compared to 2010 adding that cancer survival was at ' record levels ' .			2

18,740 patients in january waited longer than six weeks for cancer tests
reports found ' unacceptable ' variation in cancer detection across @entity39
@entity2 spends less on new cancer treatments than @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity52
