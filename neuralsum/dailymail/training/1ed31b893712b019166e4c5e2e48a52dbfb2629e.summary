a secretive and highly organised group of medieval burglars carried specialist - and rather unusual - equipment to break in to houses , experts have revealed			1
the @entity5 – a group of rogues , vagabonds , wandering poets and outright criminals – broke and entered using a kit that included a crowbar , a candle , stale bread , dried beans , an iron spike , a drill , a stick with a cloth on the end of it , a bag of sand – and crucially , a tortoise			1
opulent : the @entity5 , a group of burglars , poets and rogues - provided a contrast to the glories of @entity31 's golden age			1
pictured is an illustration from the 1909 edition of the @entity36 classic ' death of a @entity38 ' according to research carried out by the @entity44 historian professor @entity43 , @entity5 burglars often worked by tunnelling into houses , @entity39 reported			1
they used an iron spike or an iron hand with claws to break through a house wall			2
if they thought a door would be a better way of getting in they would use a crowbar instead			0
once they had made a big enough hole to squeeze through , the thief would poke a stick with a cloth on the end of it into the hole to prevent being attacked			0
the theory was that if someone had noticed a break - in from inside the house , they might attack with whatever came though the opening with a sword or hammer			2
the stick therefore prevented the thief sustaining an injury			0
a scene of daily life in 12th century @entity75 once the burglar knew it was safe to enter he employed his partner in crime : the tortoise			1
professor @entity43 described his role , writing : ‘ the tortoise is employed thus			2
the burglar has with him a flint - stone and a candle about as big as a little finger			1
he lights the candle and sticks it on the tortoise ’s back			1
' the tortoise is then introduced through the breach into the house , and it crawls slowly around , thereby illuminating the house and its contents			2
’ once the tortoise had been set up , the burglar employed his bag of sand to check for sleeping inhabitants elsewhere in the house			1
he would throw out handfuls of sand at intervals , and if no one stirred he entered the house			0
professor @entity43 also said that the burglar might chew noisily on some stale bread and beans to impersonate a cat eating a rat or mouse so as not alarm any sleeping people in the house			1
despite this knowledge , much about the @entity5 remains a matter of conjecture			1
this is because knowledge of the @entity31 underworld comes from only a handful of sources			0
most arabic literature was produced by authors writing in cities and at courts for their patrons			0
it is not at all certain , for example , how the @entity5 came by their name			2
the surviving sources mention two incompatible explanations			0
the first is that @entity31 criminals were considered to be followers or ' sons ' of @entity136 , a @entity36 prince who was displaced from his rightful place as leader in the succession and so took to living a wandering life			0
@entity141 was home to the @entity5 who broke and entered into homes using a kit that included a crowbar , a candle , stale bread , dried beans and crucially , a tortoise			1
they were widespread for six centuries the second is that the name is a corrupted version of ' @entity155 ' , the name of the old ruling dynasty of @entity75 that the @entity158 destroyed midway through the seventh century			2
rule by alien conquerors , the theory goes , reduced many @entity162 to the level of outcasts and beggars , and forced them to live by their wits			0
there is no way now of knowing which of these tales , if either , is true			0
it is known however that the @entity5 were widespread for six centuries and could be found everywhere from @entity172 to the @entity174 border			1
possessing their own tactics , tricks and slang , they provided a contrast to the glories of @entity31 ’s golden age			0
when not breaking into houses they often posed as @entity31 mystics or ascetics - well aware that the faithful @entity186 could be persuaded to part with money when a man claimed to be able to perform miracles .			0

known as the @entity5 , the group of thieves used a highly specialised set of equipment to break into houses and steal people 's possessions
the tortoise would have a candle stuck to its *shell* and would be used to light a room and keep the burglar 's hands free while he carried out his theft
not much is known about the @entity5 but they were widespread in medieval times and could be found from @entity172 to the borders of @entity174
