the last remaining full - body x-ray airport scanners are to be scrapped within weeks			1
the security systems , which have been tested at air terminals since 2009 , scan through passengers ’ clothes , creating a detailed ghost - like image of the naked body			1
the scan is then viewed by security staff			0
critics said the machines invaded passengers ’ privacy and the radiation they generate raised the risk of cancer			1
some @entity18 groups also refused to walk through them on religious grounds			0
controversial : a demonstration of the scanners that @entity24 bosses have failed to give approval of			1
a full body scan is shown , left , and a screen showing the results of the scan , right the @entity30 ruled that the cancer risk was ‘ close to zero ’ but , under @entity34 legislation , the three - year trial period has elapsed and it has decided not to ‘ prioritise ’ them for permanent use across the continent			1
@entity39 bosses who were waiting for the green light on the machines now say they have been left with no option but to remove them			1
the scanners will be replaced with ‘ privacy - friendly ’ machines which use radio - frequency technology			1
@entity48 airport , which is the last in @entity49 to be still using ‘ naked ’ scanners , said it will now have to spend £ 1.1million to replace them with the new devices			2
it will also have to hire dozens of extra security staff to frisk passengers manually			0
the airport ’s chief operating officer @entity56 said : ‘ we ’re baffled by this situation because health experts say they are safe , plus the overwhelming majority of our passengers and security staff prefer body scanners to frisking			2
‘ it ’s frustrating that @entity34 has allowed this successful trial to end			0
’ @entity68 use : more than 600 @entity70 units , using x-ray technology , have been installed at 140 airports across the @entity68 the report from the @entity74 in may said radiation doses were ' very low ' compared with other sources such as cosmic radiation received during flights			1
but it did add that the long - term effects , such as cancer risks , could not be ' entirely excluded '			1
@entity68 academic dr @entity82 said he believed the scanner could deliver up to 20 times more radiation to the skin than previously thought - potentially increasing the risk of skin cancer			1
fears were also raised that the scanners were an invasion of privacy and some passengers and religious groups had questioned their use			1
the scanners were introduced at @entity48 in a security crackdown after incidents such as the attempted ' underwear bomb ' terror plot in 2009			2
passengers selected for scanning have , in the past , been banned from flying if they refuse to pass through the device			0
@entity30 : @entity30 chiefs have failed to give their approval for their full time use despite a report declaring the risk was ' close to zero ' the airport said around 10 passengers were unable to board their flight after refusing to pass through the scanners , known as ' back scatter ' machines			1
they were used at @entity113 but scrapped amid complaints about invasion of privacy			0
they have also been tested in @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121			0
research has suggested that , despite the low radiation dosage , that because of the large number of scanners in the @entity68 , hundreds of passengers a year could get cancer			1
when there were 250 scanners in the @entity68 last year , research suggested up to 100 passengers a year could get cancer			1
the passenger screening programme at airports in the @entity68 has had frequent complaints that not all passengers are screened in the same way			0
in reaction to this , the @entity138 ( @entity138 ) has replaced the machines , which give a detailed outline of individuals ' figures , for a more generic shape			1
on the updated machine , the passenger and the @entity138 worker both view the image together which lights up on screen if it detects a problem			0
the need for a separate @entity138 officer viewing the image in another room is no longer required			0
the new images are said to be ' very generic ' and ' focus on the privacy of the passenger '			0
the images of passengers are not stored or printed and can not be transmitted			0
they are deleted from the system once they have been viewed			0
those who fly are not required by law to pass through @entity70 screening - but if they opt out , they will receive alternative screening , including a physical pat - down			2
the @entity138 has continued to defend the safety of the x-ray devices , saying they expose passengers to the same radiation as two minutes on a flying plane			1
earlier this year it was reported that more than 600 @entity70 units , using x-ray technology , have been installed at 140 airports across the @entity68 the first x-ray body scanner was developed in 1992 by @entity179			1
he sold the technology and rights to @entity182 , which now manufactures and distributes the device			2
fears about the health risks were raised in the @entity68 as far back as 1998 when the machine known as the @entity187 was evaluated by a panel of radiation safety experts brought together by the @entity190			1
they all expressed concerns about the machine because it violated a longstanding principle that humans should not be x-rayed unless there is a medical purpose			0
the machine ’s inventor told panelists that the machine would most probably not be widely used for many years to come			0
@entity39 in @entity39 was the first airport to implement the scanners in 2007			2
in the @entity68 the @entity138 scanners sparked a heated debate over security concerns versus travelers ' privacy when they were first brought in in autumn 2010			2
the machines have also been installed in some courtrooms			2
in response , @entity212 's legislature issued a resolution urging @entity215 to review the programme			0
study group @entity217 then filed a lawsuit to suspend the use of scanners at @entity68 airports pending an independent review			2
in february 2011 , a trial of new ' non-intrusive ' body scanners started at @entity226 , @entity227 , and @entity228 before they were rolled out permanently in july last yer			0
@entity232 's @entity231 followed in september last year , where more than eight million passengers boarded planes in 2010 .			0

scanners use x-ray technology to show up *hidden* *explosives* or *weapons*
fears machines could emit *harmful* *levels* of cancer - causing radiation
@entity24 report said risk ' close to zero ' but bosses still failed to give go - ahead
