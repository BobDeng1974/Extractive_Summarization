savvy mother of three @entity7 can though			1
she became the md of a successful business grossing more than one million pounds a year after becoming addicted to the auction website			1
incredibly , the 46 - year - old left school with no qualifications or business experience and only began her business as a hobby to distract her during treatment for cancer			1
but after logging on to @entity2 in her bedroom at home as a fun ‘ hobby ’ to take her mind of the treatment , she ’s become a hugely successful entrepreneur			1
in six years , her cosmetic retail business , the @entity37 and @entity38 , has grown to become a big hit on @entity2			1
it now trades worldwide and @entity7 has had to expand into a warehouse and take on four staff - including her 22 - year - old daughter , @entity43 , who is set to take over the business			1

‘ it has been really hard work but i ’d like to show other people that it can be done - if i can do it , anyone can			1
‘ anyone can earn money			0
you do n’t have to have an education , i do n’t have a gcse to my name			0
’ selling is in the genes though and @entity7 has had an interest in business since childhood			1

’ she added : ‘ i started by buying a foot spa from an end - of - line shop and seeing if i could sell it for a profit			0
‘ i bought it for £ 10 and within a week i ’d sold it for £ 30			2
‘ i would be checking the internet every half an hour			0
making that sale gave me that buzz and made me feel good			0
i did n’t think about whether i was going to die or whether the treatment was going to work			2

‘ then , when i ’d finished the treatment , i was left with an empty void and i was wondering what i was going to do next			0

within two weeks i ’d nearly sold all of that too			0
