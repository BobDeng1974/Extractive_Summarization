by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 17 november 2012 updated : 17:00 est , 17 november 2012 @entity2 future : @entity3 has seen the disease strike his @entity6 trees it ’s @entity8 ’s favourite christmas tree , found in five million homes and much loved because the needles do not drop and make a mess			1
but the @entity13 fir may not feature in future celebrations because it is being attacked by a mysterious disease which causes its needles to fall off completely			1
one of @entity8 ’s biggest growers has already suffered hefty losses			1
@entity19 , owner of @entity20 , which farms 600,000 @entity22 firs in @entity23 and @entity24 , says ‘ hundreds of thousands of pounds ’ worth of trees have been devastated			1
some other growers report losing a third of their stock			1
there are now fears the price of @entity6 trees , which has risen over the past few years , could jump even further because of shortages caused by the disease			1
the condition – current season needle necrosis ( @entity36 ) – has affected fir trees in the @entity38 and @entity39 for 20 years but was noticed in @entity8 for the first time only three years ago			1
since then the fungus , which causes needles to turn yellow in july , brown in august , then drop off completely , has spread around the country			1
the @entity46 , which represents 300 growers , warned : ‘ the disease could affect the number of marketable trees in future years if this continues			2
’ outbreaks of the disease have affected 150 members of the @entity46			0
although most have reported damage to up to three per cent of their stock , some have experienced 15 per cent damage , and there are cases where a third of trees have been lost			1
the @entity22 fir is a popular festive choice			1
it is not known why the disease has become so virulent among the tree the dramatic figures mean a grower with 2,500 trees on just an acre could have lost 833 trees			2
in such a case , with each tree fetching £ 25 wholesale , total losses would be £ 20,825			0
many growers invest in at least 6,000 trees , so losses could be as much as £ 50,000			2
@entity3 , an adviser to the @entity46 , who has found disease in some of his own trees growing near @entity82 , @entity83 , said : ‘ the disease is puzzling			0
it is connected to a fungus , @entity86 , which has been around for 30 years without a problem			0
‘ we used to see trees lose their needles after strong sunshine			2
it was like sunstroke – annoying but not serious			0
' but it has gone from benign to aggressive and we are trying to find out why			0
’ it takes eight years to grow a 6ft christmas tree and most infected firs are being observed rather than chopped down			2
@entity98 , secretary of the @entity46 , said : ‘ we ’d like to reassure people not to be concerned as the trees they purchase should stay green and healthy during the festive period			0
’ - the disease threatening to wipe out @entity8 ’s 80 million ash trees has been discovered for the first time on @entity106 land in the @entity107			0
the ash dieback fungus , known as @entity109 , was found attacking 1,000 saplings less than 3ft tall on a ten - acre site between @entity112 and @entity113			0
they have now been removed to safeguard veteran ashes , some of which are 400 years old			0
however , high winds forecast over the next few days mean they will not be burned until tuesday			0
