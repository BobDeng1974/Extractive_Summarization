the notorious killer who murdered and raped model @entity2 has been directly linked to three violent sexual attacks in @entity4 - for which a @entity6 citizen has so far served 11 years in prison			1
chef @entity8 was jailed for 34 years after killing the 18 - year - old model in @entity10 in 2005 and having sex with her while she lay ' dead or dying '			1
following his conviction , @entity12 circulated his dna and it was matched to samples taken by @entity4 police over three attempted rapes which took place in @entity19 , on the @entity20 , all between 4.30am and 6am on august 10 , 2003			1
model @entity2 ( left ) was murdered and raped by killer @entity8 in september 2005 despite the match , @entity6 citizen @entity22 , was jailed for the attacks after two of the victims and a witness watching from a window , who called the police , all identified him as the culprit			1
he told the court that he had been in @entity32 , more than 12 miles away , at the time of the attacks but could not produce any evidence of his claim			0
he was convicted in may 2005 , after spending a year and seven months in prison on remand			0
he was jailed for 15 and a half years for sexual assault , attempted rape , causing injuries and robbery with violence			0
but van der @entity22 's dna was never matched to the dna found at the scene and his lawyer , @entity46 , is demanding his release			1
he told @entity4 daily newspaper @entity48 : ' it is a disgrace that @entity51 van der @entity22 continues to be in prison without hardly any judicial procedures being carried - out			1
miss @entity54 was just 18 when she was murdered by chef , @entity56 ' it should not be possible that there could be negligence when there has been an erroneous conviction			0
an innocent person in jail should be a priority , but no - one cares			0
' when @entity4 police initially made the dna match they immediately told the courts but nothing was done and and van der @entity22 remained in prison			1
they even ran checks on @entity56 and found that he had been living on the popular southern @entity4 holiday coast between the end of 2002 and october , 2003 - two months after the three women were attacked			2
analysis of the match made in march , 2007 , showed that the samples taken in @entity19 were 54,000 times more likely to be a mixture of @entity56 's dna and that of one of the victims than of any other two people			0
that information was also sent by the police to the courts			0
but neither the investigating judge in @entity19 , who first handled van der @entity22 's case , nor the court which condemned him in @entity93 followed the police recommendation to seek further forensic evidence from @entity96			2
now , a judge at a court in the popular resort of @entity19 has finally decided to re-open the case for which @entity22 has spent eleven years behind bars			2
the @entity48 report added that @entity103 is also seeking @entity56 as an alleged murderer and serial rapist .			0
