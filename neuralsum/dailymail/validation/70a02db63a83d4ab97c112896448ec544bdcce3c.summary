isis have tried to justify the beheading of eight alleged informers as ' revenge ' for military operations targeting the @entity5 in @entity6 and @entity7 in the militants ' latest gruesome video			2
the video contrasts the murders of the eight men , all blindfolded dressed in red jumpsuits , cut with footage of people who apparently have been killed or badly injured in coalition attacks on @entity0 - held locations			1
the men are accused of being informers , engaged in military operations against @entity0			0
the men , who are both @entity7 and @entity6 , are led by their murderers out of a van onto a derelict piece of land , where they are forced to kneel in a row			0
the captors , armed with what look like meat cleavers , stand behind their victims			0
behind them , the buildings appear to have been reduced to rubble			0
interspersed with the footage of the prisoners is footage of a dead child under the rubble and in a body bag , and a dead man at the hospital , who appears to have been shot			1
the makers of the video seem to want to point the finger of blame for their latest horrendous actions at the coalition forces ' campaign against @entity0			1
revenge : the militants have justified the killings as retaliation for air strikes against land they hold to make that clear , the video begins with a mock - up of a coalition airstrike , complete with a fake jet seemingly piloted by someone with an @entity71 accent			1
‘ by @entity74 we will get our revenge , ’ the video states			1
this new video has been released just days after another @entity0 production , which claimed to show a young boy executing an alleged @entity81 - @entity80 spy			0
at about the same time , militants fighting for the @entity83 have released a video claiming to show the execution of two @entity87 soldiers			2
the militants have turned to brutal videos like these as a form of propaganda , apparently simultaneously hoping to attract new fighters and spread fear among those working against @entity0 .			0

video shows murders of eight men allegedly working against @entity83
interspersed with footage of child and man ' killed by coalition forces '
*includes* sickening video game - like ' player profiles ' of each doomed man
‘ by @entity74 we will get our revenge , ’ slickly edited video states at one point
