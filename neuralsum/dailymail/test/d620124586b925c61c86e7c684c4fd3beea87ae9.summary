he came for revenge and left having inflicted a humiliating defeat which leaves sorry @entity3 perhaps regretting they ever crossed @entity4			1
the @entity6 boss would not admit as much , but the grin he wore in the wake of @entity10 's hat - trick goal told of his satisfaction			1
four times on the spin he suffered defeat as @entity17 manager in @entity19 derbies			0
it was a ruinous run which fractured his relationship with the club 's fans and contributed towards his decision to quit @entity26 for south @entity27 in january			2
@entity6 winger @entity10 was the hero at the @entity28 having scored a hat - trick for the @entity6 against @entity3 @entity6 players surround opening goal scorer @entity31 during the comprehensive winner at the @entity28 on saturday the @entity3 defence can only watch on as the in - form @entity10 fired the visitors into an unassailable lead on saturday @entity10 sprints away in celebration having scored a second - half hat - trick in just over 10 minutes at the @entity28 on saturday afternoon this was his first trip back to the @entity40 and boy did he enjoy it			1
@entity6 now have 25 points from a possible 36 under his care and the table for 2015 alone has the @entity6 soaring in fifth , two points behind champions elect @entity49			1
his team were devastating on saturday , a ruthless and unforgiving frontline of @entity10 , @entity31 , @entity52 and @entity53 proving too powerful and too fast for a @entity3 defence which is fast running out of lives			1
@entity56 was perhaps wishing he had remained in @entity57 as he watched them surrender to four goals inside 17 minutes at the start of the second half			2

@entity3 , though , are heading for the championship and @entity56 's reputation is on the line			1
@entity4 's standing , however , has never been higher			1
he resisted temptation to crow over the identity of the victims and instead hailed the players who have now won four on the bounce			0
we were almost unplayable , ' said @entity4			2
' we 're a team that is bang in form and as a manager you can only be so proud			0
the scoreline flattered @entity3 a little bit			2
that front quartet were irresistible at times			0
we are an honest group with that pace and power and that makes us a very dangerous team			0
' @entity10 's treble bettered his total from the entirety of this campaign			1
and @entity4 added : ' i 'm surprised he has n't scored more goals			2
he 's the first @entity6 player to get a @entity111 hat - trick as well , so that is a surprise			1
' he 's at an age where he is improving			2
the final moment still needs to improve but he was excellent in that respect here			0
' @entity64 of @entity3 attempts to clear the ball with a rapid @entity10 fast approaching in mid air @entity4 's side were headed into a second - half lead thanks to this effort from striker @entity31 on 48 minutes the 31 - year - old runs away to celebrate having opened the scoring early in the second - half against @entity3 at the @entity28 @entity52 of @entity6 attempts to challenge @entity3 's @entity67 in the air during the @entity111 clash @entity68 fends off interest from @entity6 midfielder @entity90 but could n't prevent a heavy loss for the home side @entity165 joins an ecstatic @entity10 ( left ) after the @entity166 forward produced a stunning hat - trick in the second - half against @entity3 @entity56 had watched from home in @entity57 four weeks ago as @entity170 won 4 - 0 at the @entity28			1
this latest collapse leaves them just two places and three points above the drop zone			0
and the new boss said : ' i was shocked			0
you can see what can change in just six days			0
we were not in the game			0
even in the first half @entity6 were better			2
' we gave it all away inside just seven minutes			0
the work - rate from their strikers and the pace they have made it very difficult			0
we did not create any chances			0
that is a big concern			0
' but i knew when i started this job that it would be difficult			0
we still have six games			0
we can still stay up			0
we need to get our confidence back			0
' @entity10 made a point to go and celebrate with @entity6 manager @entity4 after his quick - fire hat - trick during the 4 - 1 victory @entity3 strikers @entity73 and @entity72 ca n't hide their disappointment having been comprehensively beaten on saturday the first half had been a depressing demonstration of two sides fouling one another , an occasional half - chance punctuating the boredom			1
@entity67 lunged recklessly into the leg of @entity90 with the ball long gone and was lucky to see just yellow			0
we did see red moments later , albeit the blood streaming from @entity62 's mouth after @entity85 planted his boot in the goalkeeper 's face when competing for a loose ball			0
@entity85 , in fairness , was unfortunate to be booked			0
and the game soon had its third caution when @entity68 , having been robbed by @entity10 on halfway , desperately hauled the forward back by the trim of his shirt			2
@entity6 , though , broke the tedium with their early blitz after the break			2
@entity10 was the provider for the opener when his cross was deflected onto the brow of @entity31 , who planted home from four yards for his sixth goal in as many matches			1
@entity31 tries to keep possession under the attention of @entity3 captain @entity65 during the contest at the @entity28 the stands emptied during the second - half at the @entity28 as @entity3 conceded four goals in quick succession @entity10 applauds the travelling fans holding the match ball after helping @entity6 to a 4 - 1 victory at @entity3 with a fine hat - trick within three minutes the livewire @entity166 had his first			1
@entity85 loaded a ball forward from his own half , @entity31 rose to flick on and @entity10 escaped to poke through @entity62			1
the visitors were three in front come the 54th minute , and again a long ball proved @entity3 's undoing as @entity10 pounced to rob the dithering @entity65 before lifting over @entity62			1
he did not have to wait long for his hat - trick			1
@entity6 broke through @entity31 down the right and he squared for @entity254 who , after out - scrapping @entity62 and @entity64 , poked home for his first senior treble			1
@entity3 did steal a barely deserved consolation when @entity74 turned in @entity260 's cross , but it mattered not and news of @entity262 and @entity170 's victories has them looking down once more			1
for @entity4 , things are very much looking up .			2

@entity4 's side scored second - half treble within five minutes to secure the three points
@entity31 fired the @entity6 ahead with his sixth goal in as many matches for the away side
@entity6 winger @entity10 scored a hat - trick to keep @entity3 in *relegation* trouble
@entity74 scored a late consolation for the home side , who remain just three points clear of *safety*
