by @entity0 @entity2 head coach @entity1 is well aware of the threat posed by @entity4 , but does not want his players to approach sunday 's encounter differently to any of their other matches this season			1
spurs start the weekend top of the @entity11 , having followed up a 1 - 0 win at @entity13 with an impressive 4 - 0 thrashing of @entity16 's @entity15			1
that 100 per cent start to life under the former @entity19 boss has extended to the @entity20 , where a 2 - 1 win at @entity22 was followed up on thursday by a 3 - 0 triumph in the second leg of their play - off tie			2
' we are looking forward to sunday , ' he said			2
' i think it is a great game , a tough game			2
we are looking forward to it			0
we will try to win the three points			0
' for me , all games are a big a test			2
it is true that @entity4 were second last season and they have invested a lot of money on buying different players			1
' yes , it is a big test but we need to put in place a mentality to get three points			0
we need this mentality for sunday like we had in the last games			1
' @entity52 : @entity53 celebrates scoring against @entity54 to extend @entity2 's unbeaten run to four game sunday 's match offers @entity52 a chance to gain revenge after the @entity60 , who secured one of the results of last season by winning 5 - 0 on their last visit to @entity66			1
that match resulted in @entity69 ' sacking , although successor @entity70 did not fare much better as his side went down 4 - 0 at @entity72			0
a similar humbling would seriously derail @entity1 's positive start , and is not a prospect he is even contemplating			1
' we are in the beginning of this project , ' he told @entity79			0
' only two months i have been at @entity2			1
red alert : @entity82 scores one of nine goals @entity4 hit past @entity2 last season ' @entity4 have played the last two seasons in the same way , but without any doubt we try to put our philosophy to try and win the three points			1
that for us is important			0
' it is a tough game , a good game to enjoy but in the end i think both teams will try to play in the same way , in the same philosophy			0
i think it is good for our supporters and football people			0
