an @entity1 doctor infected with the ebola virus has arrived in the @entity1 for treatment			2
a plane carrying dr. @entity5 arrived in @entity6 from @entity7 about 11am saturday morning			1
the private jet , outfitted with a special , portable tent designed for transporting patients with highly infectious diseases , arrived at @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , just outside @entity6			1
dr @entity5 was then transported about 15 miles to @entity16 via motorcade			2
news helicopter footage taken by @entity19 appears to show dr @entity5 - whose condition is listed as stable - being helped out of the ambulance and into the facility			1
a second patient , aid worker @entity42 , is expected to arrive monday			1
@entity5 was able to meet with his wife , @entity44 , in protective conditions for 45 minutes , @entity43 reported			2
she said he was in ' great spirits and extremely grateful ' to be home according to a statement released on her behalf by the @entity52 charity @entity51			1
the doctor 's sister , mother and father are also at the hospital and it was a ' relief to welcome him home ' , they said via the charity			2
@entity1 officials are confident the two patients can be treated without putting the public in any danger			2
the specialized unit at @entity16 was opened a dozen years ago to care for federal health workers exposed to some of the world 's most dangerous germs			2
arrived : dr. @entity5 , who caught @entity28 at a treatment clinic in @entity71 , @entity27 , has been evacuated to the @entity1 for treatment landed : an airplane carrying @entity1 doctor @entity5 who has the ebola virus , arrives at @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , on august 2 , 2014 fight of their lives : dr. @entity5 ( left ) and hygienist aid worker @entity42 are both in grave conditions as they battle incurable @entity28 this is a glimpse inside the containment ward at @entity16 where the two @entity1 @entity28 patients will be cared for after they arrive in the @entity1 now it 's being pressed into service for the two seriously ill @entity1 who worked at a hospital in @entity27 , one of the three @entity7 countries hit by the largest @entity28 outbreak in history			1
@entity90 director dr @entity89 acknowledged that many @entity1 are terrified about bringing dr @entity5 and hygienist @entity42 back to the @entity1 to continue the treatment of their incurable ebola infections but insisted there was no risk			1
' but i really hope that people 's fear wo n't outweigh their compassion			0
we 've got a real challenge in @entity7 and what we need to focus on is stopping the outbreak there			0
we will be able to stop it , but its going to take supporting people , ' he told @entity19			0
' and that means if people who are on that supporting mission get sick , we care for them			0
' dr @entity89 added : ' @entity28 is a huge risk in @entity7			2
it 's not going to be a huge risk in the @entity1 ' according to @entity115 , @entity16 's isolation unit is on the ground floor and has three beds with the highest standards in negative pressure air handling , @entity121 filtration and exhaust			1
' when this unit was being built , we hoped we 'd never have to use the space to treat a serious communicable disease , ' said @entity16 epidemiologist @entity127			0
special jet : the plane carrying the two @entity28 sufferers is designed to transport very ill patients long distances under constant medical care containment : inside the jet , the patients will be quarantined in these isolation tents called aeromedical biological containment systems the custom - designed jet left @entity6 for @entity27 on thursday efforts have been made to help the two patients with the means available in @entity27 - and just hours before the flight to @entity6 was revealed , father - of - two @entity5 gave up the single vial of an experimental treatment sent over from the @entity1 in order that @entity42 - a grandmother and longtime christian missionary - could receive it instead			1
@entity5 received a transfusion of the blood of a 14 - year - old @entity28 survivor who he personally helped to treat			1
giving blood transfusions from survivors to still suffering @entity28 patients is an established , though not nearly proven , treatment for the largely untreatable disease			0
however , on thursday charity @entity157 said in a statement that mrs @entity42 's condition had worsened , despite the serum			1
her husband , @entity161 , is close by but can only visit his wife through a window or dressed in a haz - mat suit			0
' we continue to pray for @entity42 's full and complete recovery , ' said @entity167 , president of @entity168			1
' even though her condition has worsened , we know she is receiving the best possible medical care , and we are thankful that she has access to this experimental drug			1
' we believe in the power of prayer and ask people around the world not only to pray for @entity42 and @entity5 , but also for everyone affected by this terrible virus			2
' the moment @entity19 reported a plane was leaving the @entity1 to pick up the @entity1 volunteers in @entity27 suffering from @entity28 , @entity178 lit up with @entity1 fuming over the decision			1
many were unable to understand why the patients could n't simply be treated in @entity27			0
' is it necessary that this person come to the @entity1 ? ca n't this be done other there ? ego trip ? ' tweeted @ 1ronweed			0
at least one of the dissenting tweets come from none other than @entity192			0
' @entity28 patient will be brought to the @entity1 in a few days - now i know for sure that our leaders are incompetent			1
@entity197 out of here ! ' @ @entity198 wrote			0
@entity192 is none - too - happy with the decision to bring an @entity28 patient to the @entity1 still others were simply thankful the patient or patients were being taken to @entity14			1
' thank god i do n't live in @entity6 , ' tweeted @ @entity206			0
so should we be worried ? not if the @entity90 's best - there - is containment systems and procedures work as they are supposed to			1
the patient or patients will be housed in an area of @entity16 's hospital that is physically separate from other patient areas , according to @entity19 's dr. @entity215			2
and inside the air will be filtered and none no staff will have any physical contact whatsoever with an infected patient outside of specialized hazmat - like suits			0
however , the move also comes soon after the @entity90 's recent string of reported mishandlings of other dangerous pathogens -- namely athrax and influenza -- made headlines -- made headlines and even forced the resignation of the head of the government lab that potentially exposed workers to live anthrax			0
dr @entity5 was in @entity7 with the missionary group responding to the @entity28 outbreak when he was diagnosed last week			1
his wife and children returned to the @entity1 before dr @entity5 showed any signs of illness			2
@entity51 has evacuated all of its non-essential personnel for the @entity28 outbreak			0
meanwhile on thursday , @entity1 health officials warned @entity1 not to travel to the three @entity7 countries hit by an outbreak of @entity28			1
the travel advisory applies to nonessential travel to @entity248 , @entity27 and @entity249 , where the deadly disease has killed more than 700 people this year			0
father : dr @entity5 , pictured with his family , ensured @entity42 received the experimental drug instead of him after a small amount arrived in @entity27 , the @entity51 charity said on wednesday waiting for an answer : @entity42 , pictured with her husband @entity161 , is entering a critical stage of her @entity28 treatment and will either show signs of recovery or inevitable death last week dr @entity5 , 33 , was identified as the first @entity1 to be diagnosed with @entity28 , which kills up to 90 per cent of those it infects			1
mrs @entity42 , 60 , an educator turned missionary from @entity267 , @entity268 , was the second			2
the first stage of the illness is characterised by fever , headaches , nausea , vomiting , a rash and diarrhea			0
the second however is haemorrhagic fever in which patients endure difficulty breathing and swallowing and agonising bleeding inside their body			0
blood pours out of their ears and nose and turns their eyes from white to red			0
they die an agonising death			0
generally patients who enter the second stage do not survive			0
mr @entity167 said that @entity168 had not yet identified how dr @entity5 and mrs @entity42 had become infected but said that they take ‘ extreme safety measures ’ and follow guidelines from the @entity90			1
he said : ' our hearts just break for them			0

father - of - two dr. @entity5 landed in @entity13 , @entity14 , just outside @entity6 , on saturday morning from @entity7
@entity28 patient , aid worker @entity42 , will arrive monday
both *victims* will be treated in a high containment facility at @entity6 's @entity16 near the @entity90
@entity5 's wife said he was ' extremely grateful ' to be home
many are outraged over the decision to bring the disease to @entity1 soil
@entity315 , from @entity316 , @entity317 , ensured @entity42 received the only dose of an experimental drug instead of himself
but it later *emerged* that mrs @entity42 's condition had worsened , despite the serum she is taking
