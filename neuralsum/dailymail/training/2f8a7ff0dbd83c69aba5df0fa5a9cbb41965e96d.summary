by @entity0 published : 12:01 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 20:01 est , 24 june 2013 a new surgery simulation tool has been created that allows brain surgeons to develop their skills without having to risk the life of a real patient			1
the @entity8 at @entity9 , in @entity10 , is using the @entity11 , which is believed to be one of the most advanced brain surgery tools in the world			1
the device allows doctors to work out how to carry out complex procedures without the need to involve a patient			2
the @entity11 is believed to be one of the most advanced brain surgery tools in the world - it allows student surgeons to trial complex procedures without risking a patient 's life @entity25 reports that the technology allows doctors to feel sensations similar to those felt during real brain surgery while they hold the surgical tools			1
the device also includes a screen which shows a high - definition simulation of a brain tumour and the effect that the tools and surgery are having on the tumour and the surrounding brain			1
dr @entity41 told live science : ‘ our main goal is to improve the resident training			0
previously , they were receiving that directly from the operating room			0
’ the simulator is currently being used in training studies and it will be several years before it can be used to train career neurosurgeons			2
the developers believe that it could eventually allow much earlier detection of which trainee surgeons will succeed and which will not			0
this would mean that less time would be spent training people who were not cut out for surgery			0
the simulator is currently being used in training studies and it will be several years before it can be used to train career neurosurgeons during the next trial , students will operate on a simulation of a brain tumour that is bleeding uncontrollably			1
the patient will die as the students work but they will be able to track the patient ’s brain activity and heart rate			0
this will allow the students to learn what stresses are involved in carrying out operations such as this , and how to deal with them .			0

@entity11 allows surgeons to develop their skills and work out how to conduct complex operations
the surgeons can see the outcomes of their ' surgery ' in high - definition on the simulator 's screen
it will be several years before it is *widely* available to surgical students
