by @entity0 absolutely paranormal : miss @entity1 admits she believes in ghosts for someone who insists she does not believe in @entity5 and is not superstitious , it is a rather surprising admission			1
but comedian @entity1 has confessed she believes in ghosts			1
the absolutely fabulous star , 55 , claimed she may even have been haunted by her late grandmother after inadvertently moving into her old address			1
she said : ‘ it could have all been in my head but when i was younger i thought i saw ghosts quite frequently			1
‘ or at least there were strange happenings			1
i ’d wake up and feel a bit funny , open my eyes and could see shapes			2
when i was at college i was living in a flat in @entity21 where there were lots of knockings at the windows and strange noises			1
‘ for ages i thought it was an annoying bird in the tree outside but there was no tree and absolutely nothing outside my window			2
then one day , my mother gave me a photograph of my grandmother in a little lacy dress , being pushed in a swing by her father			1
‘ the back of the photograph said “ 15 @entity41 ” which was the address i was living at			2
and i thought “ ooh , that ’s weird ”			2
’ miss @entity44 – who did not appear to be joking – also told @entity45 and @entity46 : ‘ i do n’t believe in @entity5 and i ’m not superstitious , but i do believe in ghosts			1
’ the comedian , who shot to fame in the 1980s after writing and starring alongside @entity51 in @entity52 sketch show @entity53 , spoke of the joy her grandsons have brought her			2
her eldest daughter @entity56 gave birth to first son @entity58 two years ago and second son @entity59 in february			2
@entity60 hit : absolutely fabulous with @entity61 ( @entity1 ) and @entity62 ( @entity63 ) miss @entity1 , whose book bonkers : my life in @entity67 has been released in paperback , said : ‘ i was at both births and it was just heaven			0
‘ we ’re all so pleased because it ’s a very female house and now we ’ve got these two little boys who are just gorgeous			1
' i ’m a very hands - on granny			0
all those things i ’ve kind of been grieving for , as my own kids have grown up			0
in an interview for the may issue of @entity79 , the comedian , 55 , talks about changing her views on feminism , the lack of women on tv panel shows and how she 's started writing the @entity88 film ' there ’s nothing really fascinating about the ducks – or a tractor or the grass – but there is when you ’re with a child			1
it ’s just so lovely to do it all again with them			0
’ raising three daughters has also transformed her views on feminism			0
miss @entity1 , who is married to fellow comic @entity104 , said : ‘ my middle daughter @entity105 does comedy and it ’s a sad fact that boys have a much easier time			1
' if you take a girls ’ show and a similar boys ’ show , the boys will get the job because there ’s a prevailing thought that , “ hey , they ’re wacky , they ’re guys ” versus “ there ’s the girls , trying a bit hard ”			0
‘ it ’s the same on the panel shows – it ’s a boysy thing			0
it is n’t awful , because it ’s actually funny a lot of the time			0
but a lot of the time it is n’t – it ’s a competition to see how many times they can mention their genitalia – and sometimes you just think “ oh please just stop it ! ” ’ miss @entity1 received worldwide acclaim in the early to mid- 1990s for writing and playing the lead role of @entity136 in the sitcom @entity88			0
the show also revived the career of actress @entity63			1
miss @entity1 is now writing the new absolutely fabulous film			0
she said she found the weight of expectation ‘ more than for any series , so the fall could be a lot greater if it does n’t work ’			0
