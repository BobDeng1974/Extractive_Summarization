both @entity9 and @entity2 have refused to comment but it is understood the relevant sanction in the @entity12 rules set to be applied is : ' restriction on the number of players that a club may register for participation in @entity9 competitions , including a financial limit on the overall aggregate cost of the employee benefits expenses of players registered on the a-list for the purposes of @entity9 club competitions			1
