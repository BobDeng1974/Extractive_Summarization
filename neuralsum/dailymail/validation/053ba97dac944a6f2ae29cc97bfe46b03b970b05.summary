@entity6 killed his wife in a horrific attack with a claw hammer , and the next day he considered deliberately crashing his @entity10 747 in order to ' make a statement '			1

@entity6 was arrested later the same day , and subsequently convicted of manslaughter and jailed for 26 years			0
@entity26 's mother , @entity63 , told the @entity71 that following the case airlines should ahve done more to ensure that pilots can not endanger their passengers			1
she said : ' @entity6 's claim in court that he planned to ditch a commercial flight the day after he killed her was chilling to hear , and yet there has never been any acknowledgement from @entity1 that lessons can be learnt from that			1
' the victim 's best friend @entity82 said that there were ' chilling similarities ' between @entity6 's case and that of @entity24 , who were both fitness fanatics			1
@entity6 told his @entity1 bosses that he was feeling stressed out , but they did not follow up the conversation to check that he was in a fit mental state to fly , she said			2
plane : @entity6 had been due to fly a @entity1 @entity10 similar to this one ( file photo ) similarly , @entity24 was apparently signed off from work following a struggle with depression , but ripped up the doctors ' notes he was given excusing him from flying			1
