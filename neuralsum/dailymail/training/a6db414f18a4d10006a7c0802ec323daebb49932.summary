at @entity33 , the judge mr recorder @entity31 , @entity32 , told @entity34 who admitted burglary : ‘ you worm your way into the life of an elderly person , gain their trust and then abuse that trust			2
‘ i have formed the very clear view that it ’s necessary to protect elderly people from you for a significant period of time			0
‘ i would be failing in my duty were i not to do so			0
those who are most vulnerable in our society , the elderly and the infirm , must have the greatest protection of the courts			0
’ earlier the court heard how @entity34 had more than 50 offences on her criminal record starting in 2001 when she burgled sheltered accommodation for the elderly and took a purse			1
she had amassed 20 convictions by the time she was only 16			2
three years later she developed a drug habit and went on a burglary spree with her then heroin addicted boyfriend			2
@entity6 is pictured in 2013 with a the same expression on her face			1
on this occasion , she sent back to court after stealing £ 500 from a 79 - year - old woman suffering from dementia			1
she had offered to help her with errands but stole her bank card instead and was jailed for 20 weeks , but then freed due to time she spent on remand in august 2011 she was seven months pregnant with her second child when she was given a community order after being caught with a wheel bin stuffed with stolen household goods from an old folk ’s home			2

she was jailed for 20 weeks but freed due to time she spent on remand			0
the latest theft occurred just two months later after the 70 - year old victim had been left incapacitated on his right side by up to three strokes and was suffering reduced dexterity in his right arm and hand			1
the court heard as a result of the strokes , the victim struggled to speak , walked with a stick and had carers to help with this daily living such as bathing and cooking and supervise his medication			1
he spent most of the day lying on his bed inside the ground floor flat in a terrace row and kept his door open because of his mobility issues and to allow the carers to come in and out			0
but @entity115 prosecuting said @entity34 and her friends would regularly hang around outside the victim ’s house and often went into the flat to drink alcohol and chat			2
mrs @entity115 said : ' the victim , on many occasions , was content for them to do this			2
he ’s a lonely man and at times , enjoys the company			0
' but the man contacted police and said a sock containing money he was saving had been stolen			0
the pensioner became very concerned about @entity34 and her friends being in the flat and she was no longer welcome			0
but last november 12 , she turned up at his home and when the victim told her to go away , she put her hand down his trousers			1
mrs @entity115 added : ' she was looking for money but because she did n’t find any , she unzipped the pocket of his track suit bottoms and removed £ 20			0
she was talking to him about her children as she did this			0
when he saw she had taken the money , he shouted at her again			0
' @entity33 @entity144 , where @entity6 , of @entity25 , @entity26 , was jailed for more than four years			1
the court heard how she had committed 50 offences in 13 years the prosecutor said the victim grabbed @entity34 ’s hood and called her a thief , but she broke free and left			1
when his carer arrived soon after , he found the pensioner walking out of his bedroom , breathing heavily and shaking and knew immediately something was wrong			0
the 70 - year - old told him what had happened and the carer called the police			1
@entity34 later denied being in the man ’s home and claimed he was unreliable because he was a ' heavy drinker			0
' she then alleged she had taken the victim ’s money for payment for “ sexual favours ” that she had given him			0
in mitigation defence counsel @entity167 said @entity34 was now on methadone and added : ' she appreciates the impact this offence has had			0
heroin addiction is like no other addiction known to man			0
' those who are addicted to heroin show the least victim empathy at the time of the offence and they will do anything they can to satisfy their need for that drug			1
' mr @entity167 also read a letter of apology to the court from @entity34 which said : ' i so badly want to wake up in the mornings happy and not worry where i am going to get my drugs from			2
' i ’m not a bad person and i know that it was wrong			0
