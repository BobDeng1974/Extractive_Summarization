by @entity0 published : 13:33 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 19:42 est , 25 november 2013 an @entity2 man cheated death wednesday night by the slimmest of margins			0
@entity6 , of @entity7 , was rear - ended by a truck last week , causing a load of lumber to shoot through his back windshield and almost kill him			1
the lumber scraped the side of his head and came to rest on his steering wheel			1
mr @entity6 , a registered nurse , then immediately jumped out of his vehicle to make sure no one else was injured in the multi-car pileup			1
the luckiest man alive : @entity6 suffered only minor scrapes to his head ‘ i get stopped , and look at the lumber in my front seat and say to myself ‘ damn			2
that should have killed me , ’ he wrote on his @entity22 page			0
‘ then i do what any good nurse would do			0
i jump out of my car and yell ‘ is anyone hurt ? i ’m a nurse ! ’ paramedics arrived as mr @entity6 tended to the other vehicles and were amazed he was okay			1
‘ the paramedic asks me to step back cause ‘ this is gon na be gruesome , ’ he continued			0
‘ i do n't think they believed me when i told them it was my car			0
’ shiver me timbers : not even mr @entity6 himself can believe he survived so narrowly incredible : the lumber shot just past his head and hand , shocking paramedics who expected a gruesome scene amazed he still has a hand : mr @entity6 says he moved his hand just before the lumber plowed through his vehicle , or else he would have lost it one of the paramedics told him she expected much worse , he further explained			1
pictures taken by the lucky man show what looks like an impossibly lu cky escape from death , it does n’t look like anyone could possibly have walked away from the vehicle alive			2
he was taken to a hospital after a brief on - scene examination			0
as word of how mr @entity6 made it to the hospital spread , he began to receive visitors looking to catch lightning in a bottle			1
a miracle : this incident looks unsurvivable from the front of the truck how could anyone survive this : the lumber took out the head rest on the driver 's seat what a wreck : in addition to lumber almost taking his life , the rear end of mr @entity6 's truck is also smashed up ‘ most of the people there wanted to rub my head for luck , ’ he wrote			1
‘ could n't count the number of people who told me to buy a lottery ticket			0
’ a doctor told him he would be fine , to just take pain killers and buy that lottery ticket			0
his vehicle is heavily damaged , but he ’s okay – and looking to the future			2
‘ i told @entity100 , if he 's going to save me from death from this and he does n't send me a boyfriend , i 'm going to call a party foul , ’ he told @entity99 .			2

@entity6 was involved in a multi-car pileup last week in @entity7 , or
the truck behind him had a load of lumber that became *detached* and flew into mr @entity6 's vehicle
the lumber scraped his head and just missed killing him
