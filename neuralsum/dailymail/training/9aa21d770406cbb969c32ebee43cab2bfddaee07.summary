different vocal traits are associated with size , attractiveness , friendliness by @entity4 published : 16:52 est , 24 april 2013 updated : 01:47 est , 25 april 2013 @entity5 , forget the expensive cologne and witty one - liners , the way to a woman 's heart could be as simple as lowering your voice			1
scientists have found different vocal traits are instinctively associated with body size , attractiveness and friendliness			1
they discovered the most desirable male voice for @entity19 women is deep , rumbling and breathy , indicating the ideal blend of masculinity , strength , with a hint of tenderness			1
which may explain @entity27 's success with the ladies in the sitcom friends , with his catchphrase " how you doin ' " perfectly encapsulating all these characteristics			0
charming the ladies could be as simple as lowering your voice , explaining @entity27 's success with the ladies in the sitcom friends while for women wanting to attract a @entity19 man , their delivery should be high - pitched and breathy , which signals to the male psyche they are petite and , controversially , open and submissive			1
' for women , it is a bit of a sexist prototype			2
the research suggests that subconsciously , men are more attracted to a female voice that indicates friendliness and submission , ' said lead researcher dr @entity48 , a reader in speech sciences at @entity50			1
' men prefer a voice which projects a small body size , which is higher pitched and breathy			1
@entity54 is a good example			0
' politicians have long been aware of the impact of their voice			2
@entity59 famously underwent vocal training to lower her tone and make her sound more statesmanlike @entity59 famously underwent vocal training to lower her tone and make her sound more statesmanlike			2
according to dr @entity48 , breathiness as seen as sultry in women , and tender in men			0
it is also more common in younger women , which may add to its appeal			0
' even for males , if you want to be attractive to females , it is better to be breathy than aggressive in terms of voice quality			2
but in pitch , we found it is more attractive to be low , which indicates masculinity , ' he said			0
' for a man , the perfect combination is both masculinity and tenderness - that was the preferred voice type			0
' in the animal world , listeners can perceive a caller 's body size based on the noise they make			0
for example , low frequency growls suggest a larger body size , dominance or a potential attack , while higher frequency and pure - tone - like sounds indicate a smaller size , submissiveness and fear			0
the research , published in journal @entity104 , carried out several experiments were both men and women listened to recordings of the opposite speaking a sentence to test vocal attractiveness			1
the results showed male listeners preferred breathy female voices with high pitch - although not too high - correlating with a petite size , while women preferred to hear low - pitched men that suggested they were larger , stronger specimens			1
but surprisingly , female listeners also preferred breathy male voices , which signals they prefer the aggressiveness associated with a large body to be somewhat tempered			2
the study also explains why distinctive voices are also often deemed less appealing			0
the report concluded : ' these results suggest that what make the voice attractive are mostly properties that enhance characteristics already in the averaged voice of the sex - high pitch ... and breathiness in [ the ] female voice , and low pitch and long vocal tract in the male voice			1
' these findings may therefore explain why averaged voices are more attractive than certain individual voices			0
