a seaside town fired at by volleys of shells in a bombardment , which left 18 dead on the home front during the @entity5 , is commemorating those who lost their lives			1
tomorrow marks exactly 100 years since the residents of @entity9 , @entity10 , were unexpectedly attacked by three @entity12 warships , damaging schools , homes , churches , hospitals and the lighthouse			1
the shelling , which started shortly after 8am on december 16 , 1914 , left 18 people dead and 200 others injured and it took years for the coastal town to rebuild itself			1
to mark a century since the devastation hit , a maroon will be fired from @entity38 after the name of each of the victims is read out at a special dawn ceremony tomorrow			0
the castle will be lit up during the ceremony and a flotilla of boats will be stationed outside the harbour			0
at another service , which will be held at @entity50 , wreaths will be laid on a new cairn bearing the names of all those who died			0
@entity54 was badly damage when it was bombarded by shells from @entity12 in the unexpected attack ( left ) and rebuilt now ( right ) the @entity58 in @entity9 was left with a gaping hole after the shelling ( left ) but has since been refurbished and reopened for business the restaurant at the @entity63 was ruined with tables and chairs strewn across an area which would have been much busier had it been peak summer season @entity9 's @entity69 ( pictured ) was targeted in the bombardment as the town started waking up on a cold winter 's morning 100 years ago the 1914 raid was the first successful one on @entity74 shores for 250 years , since a @entity76 fleet sailed up the @entity77 and the @entity78 and destroyed much of @entity80 ’s navy in @entity81 and @entity82			1
although a number of lives were lost , including that of 14 - month - old @entity87 , it is believed that the toll could have been much higher as the winter weather and the early hour meant less people were around			2
the raid became important in the war as a mode of propaganda after @entity95 , then @entity96 and a leading public figure , denounced them as the ‘ baby - killers of @entity9 ’ for their unprovoked attack on a defenceless population			0
it was then used in a recruitment drive and to stir up bad feelings against the @entity12			2
posters were printed , which read ' remember @entity9 ! enlist now			0
' children look in horror at the aftermath of the @entity12 shelling of @entity74 's @entity111 , which left 18 dead and 200 others with injuries a grandfather clock can be seen as it 's removed from a ruined building ( left ) and the remains of the town 's lighthouse , which was struck ( right ) shop fronts were damaged and windows smashed , including those on @entity9 's @entity123 ( above ) during the attack in december 1914 four of the fatalities that day came from the same family and the government used photographs of their house on its posters			1
another , issued within weeks of the shelling , bore the headline : ' @entity9 - up and at ' em now			0
' the text added : ' the wholesale murder of innocent women and children demands vengeance			0
men of @entity144 , the innocent victims of @entity12 brutality call upon you to avenge them			2
' show @entity12 barbarians that @entity74 's shores can not be bombarded with impunity			1
go today to the nearest recruiting depot and offer your services for @entity154 and home and country			0
