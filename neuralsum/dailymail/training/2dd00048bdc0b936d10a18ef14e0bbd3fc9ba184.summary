@entity0 continued to press for a winner despite being down to 10 men but neither side could find the vital goal and the points were shared			1
@entity4 sends @entity24 the wrong way to earn @entity5 a 1 - 1 draw with @entity0 it was a quiet start with @entity29 's cross evading everyone and ending up safely in the arms of @entity0 goalkeeper @entity24			1
@entity32 then found an opening down the other end but his shot was high and wide as the visitors attempted to put their stamp on the game			0
@entity24 was beaten in the 21st minute as @entity4 controlled a ball over the top from @entity41 beautifully with his right foot and rifled home with his left but the former @entity46 international as marginally offside			0
barring that chances were at a premuim but @entity0 were looking the more likely to score with @entity8 heading weakly wide from a corner and @entity32 blazing over again from distance			2
the veteran striker celebrates scoring his penalty , ending @entity0 's four - game @entity1 winning run and they did just that three minutes before the break thanks to a howler from @entity58			1
@entity59 crossed from the right and the @entity62 defender missed the ball completely as he swung a boot to clear , leaving @entity8 to finish from three yards			0
@entity5 came out with purpose in the second half and @entity4 had three good chances to net the equaliser within four minutes			1
@entity69 whipped in a free - kick which the veteran got on the end of but saw his shot saved by @entity74			0
moments later he fired into the side - netting after showing great technique to hit a volley after the ball had ballooned off @entity79 but he will have been most disappointed to miss his next opportunity in the 54th minute			0
@entity81 and @entity8 celebrate after the latter opened the scoring on thursday evening @entity29 went on a darting run down the right and provided the perfect cross for @entity4 but the 37 - year - old could only head over the bar when he really should have done better			1
despite those three chances , @entity0 were playing the better football and enjoying the more possession but the home side were doing well to keep them at bay			0
the visitors continued to press but it was @entity5 who equalised from the penalty spot in the 69th minute when @entity13 was handed his marching orders			1
@entity100 was sent off for two bookable offences , the second came when he gave away the penalty the full - back had already been booked for an earlier foul and when he took a firm grip on the right wrist of @entity14 in the box and pulled the substitute back , the referee had no choice but to point to the spot and produce a second card			2
@entity4 stepped up and sent @entity24 the wrong way , beating him low to his right , to level the scores			0
despite being a man down , @entity0 continued to force the issue and @entity118 produced a smart run and cross but @entity59 could not get any power on his header			2
@entity14 blazed a shot wide at the other end after @entity4 mishit his effort from the edge of the box - but neither side could find a winner			0
