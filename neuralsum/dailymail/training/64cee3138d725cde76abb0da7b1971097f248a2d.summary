by @entity0 , @entity1 a month after insisting it remained ' some distance ' from being able to stage the @entity4 in @entity5 for the first time since 1951 , the @entity2 is set to announce @entity7 will host the championship in 2019			1
rumours of the @entity4 returning to @entity10 have been circulating for some time , with reports on may 11 claiming a deal had been done for 2019 , 68 years after @entity13 won the only @entity4 staged outside @entity14 and @entity15			1
the @entity2 's initial response on @entity17 labelled such reports as ' @entity10 rumours ' and a statement issued later read : ' as part of our commitment to examine the feasibility of staging an @entity4 at @entity10 , the @entity2 continues to discuss this at a conceptual level with @entity7 and the @entity27			1
magnificent : the green on the par 4 , 5th hole ' @entity31 ' at @entity7 ' discussions have been positive but we are still some distance from being in a position to take @entity4 to @entity5			2
' however , it is understood an announcement is expected to be made shortly , possibly on monday to coincide with the first day of the @entity39 which is being staged at @entity10 and @entity40			2
the @entity2 denied reports last summer that the @entity4 was set to be held at @entity10 in 2018			1
@entity2 chief executive @entity42 admitted that it is ' a fantastic golf course ' , but concerns remained over the infrastructure required to stage a major and @entity42 feels the current nine - course @entity4 rota is ' about right			2
' @entity10 has not hosted a major championship since the @entity51 , but the @entity52 drew massive crowds there in 2012 and the likes of major champions @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 have been lobbying on @entity10 's behalf			1
it has also been suggested that the @entity2 would hasten their decision after @entity10 emerged as a surprise contender to stage the @entity65			2
picturesque : a view over the 4th fairway and 7th green in evening light on the @entity71 at @entity7 the @entity72 is studying the impact of holding the event outside the @entity75 , with the earliest possible date in 2020			0
it had been thought that @entity78 would be the most likely venue , but @entity72 president @entity80 said in november last year that he was interested in @entity10			0
@entity10 native @entity59 , whose brother works at the club , said at the time : ' it 's always been a dream of mine to play the @entity4 there but the @entity75 @entity72 would do nicely			1
' it 's very bizarre and an amazing statement			0
i could n't believe it and read it three times			0
i had heard the @entity75 @entity72 was looking at going global , which is a very positive step forward , but i was expecting @entity78 , not the north coast of @entity5			0
' even if it never comes to fruition it 's a great boost to be mentioned in that breath			0
my brother @entity98 is on the greenkeeping staff there and he will have a spring in his step			0
