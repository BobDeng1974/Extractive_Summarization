by @entity0 picture the scene			2
a small , visibly distressed girl asks to speak to her teacher the day after she returns from a holiday in @entity5			2
the teacher listens as the girl explains what has happened to her : her clitoris removed , her legs bound together			2
terrible pain , no anaesthetic			0
her teacher 's shocking response : ' that 's nice dear			2
a bit like a @entity17			1
' for the young @entity20 , any hope of help had gone			1
campaigner : @entity22 has spoken out about why @entity23 should n't be written off as a cultural issue speaking out : @entity5 supermodel @entity25 underwent @entity23 as a child and campaigns against it a quarter of a century on and @entity20 remains furious but is determined to ensure that no other child will be left to suffer in silence as she did			1
' it 's easy to believe that this sort of thing only happens in other countries and cultures , but the reality is it 's happening here in @entity40 , ' she explains			1
' for too long , it has been passed off as a " cultural " ritual			0
but this act is not about celebration			0
@entity23 is gender - based violence , it 's as simple as that			1
the practice tells women that they are merely " vessels " to carry children ; they deserve no sexual pleasure			2
' i 've now made it my quest to stand up and fight against @entity23			1
' and her help is most certainly needed			0
despite being illegal in the @entity40 , @entity23 or female genital mutilation , is on the rise with an estimated 66,000 women dealing with the after - effects and more than 20,000 young girls thought to be at risk			1
worldwide , more than three million women have been subjected to @entity23 , many of whom come from @entity69 countries such as @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity5			1
those countries , many of which are part of the @entity76 , are at the heart of @entity40 's @entity23 problem , and as a result , the majority of @entity40 women to suffer @entity23 are part of the @entity40 's 600,000 - strong ethnic @entity69 community			1
when people fled from @entity86 in @entity5 or @entity87 in @entity70 , many came to the @entity40 - bringing with them local traditions , including @entity23			1
but @entity69 is n't the only place where the practice is widespread			0
women in @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and others are also highly likely to be forced to undergo @entity23			1
although it is illegal to take a girl abroad for fgm under @entity40 law , @entity20 was just seven years old when she was taken to @entity5 for a ' holiday ' where she would be subjected to the horrific procedure			1
' towards the end of the holiday , we took a two - day drive through the desert , arriving eventually at a huge house , ' remembers @entity20			2
' there was a woman at the door in a burka			0
i was scared and instinctively started running			0
when i was caught , i was taken into a room filled with instruments i did n't recognise			0
' the woman i was so afraid of was there waiting for me			0
she scolded me for running away , telling me how difficult it was to obtain equipment like this ; how ungrateful i was			0
' i blacked out before she started cutting			0
i 'm still not sure whether it was the anaesthetic or pure fear			0

nine - year old @entity127 pictured days after undergoing @entity23 at home in @entity129 ( right ) when @entity20 awoke , it was to find herself in agony with her legs bound together			1
although she was taken home to the @entity40 two days later , @entity20 found that friends and teachers were unwilling to take her story seriously , leaving her feeling let down and alone			1
twenty two years later , @entity20 launched a charity , @entity140 , with fellow @entity23 survivors @entity141 and @entity143			1
change : home secretary @entity144 has pledged tougher rules in order to stamp out @entity23 in the @entity40 the trio travel the length and breadth of the @entity40 , raising awareness and encouraging people to pressurise the government into stopping the practice once and for all			1
although @entity23 has been illegal in the @entity40 since 1985 , there has n't been a single conviction , despite overwhelming evidence that it still happens			1
' since i started campaigning , i 've heard harrowing stories from girls all over @entity162 , ' says @entity20			1
' the young woman who , after refusing @entity23 when she was taken to @entity164 on a visit , endured beatings for the duration of the two week stay , and whose mother poured acid on her vagina when she was sleeping after they returned to @entity162 to gain a similar effect			2
' a white @entity162 woman from @entity175 who came to tell us that she did n't previously have a name for what her dad did to her when she was 14 , which was sew her up because she told him she was gay			0
' home secretary @entity144 confronted the issue during a parliamentary debate on the issue earlier this year			0
' sadly , what we see are too many examples of this terrible crime continuing to take place , ' she said			0
' i think most people would be shocked to know how many young girls within the @entity40 are subjected to female genital mutilation			1
' we need to redouble our efforts to make sure we educate young girls about the prospects of being taken abroad or having this done to them , but also ensure that we educate others not to do this terrible act			2
' the home secretary 's efforts can not come soon enough for @entity20 and girls like her who , @entity20 says , will likely endure lasting psychological and physical damage as a result of the mutilation			1
' what i went through as a seven - year - old has stayed with me , ' she says			0
' but i have been lucky			0
there are girls who are crippled by depression and anxiety , traumatised by what has happened to them and those that will never enjoy sex , and never find the strength to speak out			2
' i want to help them all and let them know that they are not alone			0
right now , they are victims			0
soon , they 'll be survivors			0
