an ancient landscape long ago submerged beneath the @entity1 has been discovered by scientists			1
researchers found the 56million - year - old lost terrain , which they have likened to the mythical lost city of @entity6 , by analysing data collected for oil companies using an advanced echo - sounding technique			1
the 1.2mile - deep landscape is located in the @entity1 west of the @entity11 and has peaks that once belonged to mountains and eight major rivers			1
scientists were able to construct this 3d image of the landscape submerged beneath the @entity1 by measuring the echoes made by underwater sound waves as they hit different land types it would once have risen up to 0.6miles above sea level and probably joined up with what is now @entity25 , and may even have stretched as far as @entity26 , the scientists said			1
researcher @entity27 , from @entity28 , said : ' it looks for all the world like a map of a bit of a country onshore			0
' it is like an ancient fossil landscape preserved 1.2miles beneath the seabed			0
' the discovery came from data gathered by a seismic contracting company			0
a hi - tech echo - sounding technique was deployed that involved releasing high - pressured air underwater - this produced sound waves that travelled through sediment on the ocean floor			1
an echo would bounce back each time these waves happened upon a change in the terrain through which they were travelling			2
how the @entity1 would have looked around 56million years ago			1
points a , b and c are where scientists think plume centres were located			2
the dotted line represents the continental break - up this echo was then picked up by a microphone being dangled deep underwater from a ship travelling on the ocean 's surface			2
scientists were then able to construct a 3d image of the terrain below , at which point they realised they had evidence of a submerged landscape			2
evidence of land - dwelling life was gathered by core samples taken from the rock beneath the ocean - these revealed pollen and coal			0
elsewhere , the @entity28 scientists found tiny fossils , proving the landscape was once a marine environment			0
they believe that the landscape rose up and subsided within 2.5million years due to the @entity82 - an upwelling of material through @entity86 's mantle beneath the @entity1			1
this functions by carrying hot magma from deep within @entity86 to just below the surface , where it ripples outwards			0
dr @entity27 said the landscape was probably swept beneath the @entity1 during this magma surge			1
indeed , he claims to have found two more recent underwater landscapes since , both caused by the same phenomenon			0
the research is published in the journal @entity99 .			0

lost terrain is 56million years old
it is located in the @entity1 west of the @entity105 - @entity104
