by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent tories expressed astonishment that @entity4 , a former adviser to @entity5 , had secured the plum job on @entity7 the @entity9 ’s controversial new signing as @entity7 economics correspondent yesterday denied he was a ‘ dangerous leftie ’ – and revealed he once supported the leader of the @entity14 sir @entity13			1
@entity4 , a former adviser to @entity5 , the @entity16 deputy leader , and economist at the @entity18 , was given the plum job earlier this week despite having little experience as a journalist			1
senior @entity2 were furious , saying that the appointment was proof that the corporation is becoming increasingly biased against the conservatives			1
yesterday , mr @entity4 hit back in a bizarre online article in which he said he spent more time as a banker than a @entity16 adviser , and admits having had some sympathy when he was a teenager for @entity13			1
after the year - long flirtation with the far right ended , he joined the @entity16 at the age of 18			1
he wrote on his blog that it had been a ‘ weird few days ’ since his appointment was announced			1
‘ given my current role at the @entity18 and brief stint as a @entity16 adviser , i fully expected my appointment to raise a few eyebrows , ’ he said			1
‘ even so i was n’t quite prepared for the howls of outrage from some quarters			2
‘ never mind that i have spent more of my career working in the apolitical worlds of the @entity44 and fund management than working for @entity16 or the unions , or that several right - wing economists and commentators familiar with my work warmly welcomed my appointment , or that i have frequently been critical of @entity16 ’s economic policy			1
writing under a pseudonym , @entity4 , the new @entity7 correspondent , confessed to his flirtation with fascism mr @entity4 , a former adviser to @entity5 , the @entity16 deputy leader , and economist at the @entity18 , was given the plum @entity7 job earlier this week despite having little experience as a journalist ‘ none of that seemed relevant to those who saw me as a dangerous leftie corrupting the @entity9 ’s coverage of economics			1
’ he said he had come clean about his involvement with the far right - during what he called the ‘ hormone - charged mists of adolescence ’ - following an approach from a sunday newspaper			1
he said he had had a ‘ brief and misguided flirtation ’ with the ideas of the far right after reading a biography of @entity13 by @entity73 , whom he said had ‘ seemed to grasp the need to tackle unemployment where other politicians did not ’			1
he said he never attended any far right meetings and had joined @entity16 by the time he was 18			2
a year later , he wrote a piece about his involvement with the far right for a student paper in @entity83 , which appeared under the headline : ‘ i was a fascist ’			2
the first paragraph of the piece said : ‘ like a lot of bad things this started with the @entity91 party			2
’ he said in his blog that the wording made him ‘ wince ’ , adding : ‘ i suspect i may be reminded of that line a few times in the coming months			2
’ mr @entity4 concluded : ‘ reflecting on the last week , it ’s hard to escape the irony that i have been accused of being a dangerous leftie and also a fascist within 48 hours			1
i hope i ’m neither			2
‘ i think i ’ve got a long track record – from the @entity44 to the @entity18 – of examining the economic facts and letting the chips fall where they may			1
‘ the @entity9 is full of journalists from a wide range of backgrounds who left their political baggage at the door the day they started work			1
i ’m confident that once in the job i ’ll be able to do just that			2
’ sir @entity13 was the charismatic founder of the @entity14 before he founded the @entity14 , sir @entity13 was the mp for @entity115 from 1918 to 1924 being elected for the conservatives before becoming independent and then joining the @entity16			0

by 1pm on the day , around 2,000 of @entity13 ’s black shirts had gathered around @entity130 while around 500 @entity133 and anti-fascists congregated at @entity139			0
they ran to @entity130 where they armed themselves with sticks and formed a barricade by overturning a lorry			0
at 3.30pm , @entity130 was the scene of some of the worse street fighting seen in @entity148 and @entity13 ’s @entity149 drove into @entity150 where it was pelted with bricks			0
@entity13 ’s supporters began chanting his name while the anti-fascists retaliated with the @entity155			0
@entity13 then gave a @entity157 salute and was advised by the police to drive back through the @entity159 rather than press ahead			0
