’ @entity36 is far from the first church to attempt to win over a young demographic , but few have been able to pull it off as successfully as @entity36 , according to @entity151			0
concert - like atmosphere : it is clear why the demographic for @entity0 's flock of the @entity89 - based @entity147 skews young still , @entity36 is just as susceptible to the downfalls of any modern progressive church , and there is always the danger that the trendy concert culture could overshadow the message , @entity151 said			1
