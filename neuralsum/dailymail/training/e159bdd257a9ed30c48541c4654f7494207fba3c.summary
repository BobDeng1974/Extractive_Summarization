this is the heartbreaking moment young girls in @entity2 are sold into arranged marriages for a dowry of livestock as part of a traditional ceremony which marks their passing into womanhood			1
clad in tribal jewellery and with their hair tied up in braids , some of the women can be seen struggling as they are hauled away , traded by their fathers for 20 goats , three camels , and ten cows			0
many of the girls , who are members of the @entity23 tribe , are not aware they have been bargained away until their husbands come to collect them after spending a month in isolation before the ceremony takes place			1
as part of the ritual , which lasts a day and night , the village men will also select a bull from the herd of cows which the women will punch into submission before it is executed with a spear - thrust to the heart			1
this particular ceremony took place in the bush around 30 miles ( 50km ) from the town of @entity85 in @entity86 which is home to around 133,000 plains @entity23			2
many of the girls will be as young as 14 , despite @entity2 law now forbidding childhood marriage			2
as with many tribal customs , however , strict adherence to tradition is considered more important than complying with the law			0
fight : a girl grips on to her parents ' arms before being taken away by her new husband in @entity2 as part of a tribal ceremony ritual : the women will remain standing for more than a day and a night during the ceremony , which also involves dancing make way : men arrive in the village leading the last train of cattle as they prepare to take the wives they have bargained for home with them @entity112 : child marriage has been outlawed in @entity2 in an attempt to crack down on tribal practices , but many will simply ignore the law the @entity118 developed their social structure and practices in order to maximise their chances of survival of each household in an often difficult and hostile environment , but they are coming to be viewed as barbaric and unacceptable in modern - day @entity2			1
during the ceremony the girls will sing and stay standing from the afternoon through out the night and the morning after			0
at the end of the ceremony , the girls and the boys of the community dance together , supervised by elders			0
while the images show the girls ' shock and distress at what is happening to them , it is unlikely to be the first time they have suffered hardships at the hands of their parents and tribal tradition			0
brutal : as part of the ceremony the village men will also select a bull from among the cattle to be slaughtered and eaten beaten : however before it is killed the women are required to punch it into submission as a sign of their new strength attack : women of the @entity23 tribe in @entity2 beat a young bull as part of a ceremony that marks their passing into adulthood @entity166 : after the women have weakened the cow by punching it , it is killed by the men using a single spear stab to the heart blessing : a pokot man holds a lamb as he blesses more than a hundred girls during an initiation ceremony marking the girls ' coming of age the pokot people are also known to practice female genital mutilation , a practice whereby parts of a woman 's sexual organs are removed using scissors , a razor blade , or glass before they are sewn up and have their legs bound together until the wounds heal			1
the tradition is carried out at a much younger age than the forced marriages , in the belief it will help to keep the girls pure until the time comes for them to undergo the ceremony that will see them become women			2
however , as the ceremonies are usually carried out by unskilled quack doctors operating miles from any hospital and with no anesthetic or antibiotics , deaths are common due to blood loss or infection			0
beauty : a girl has her hair braided before it is filled with beads as part of a beauty regime before she takes part in the ritual alone : the girls are isolated for more than a month in dark tents before they are handed over to their new husbands as they become women decoration : a pokot girl has her face smeared with white paint , beads put into her hair , and braids made using a mixture of dirt and oil on your feet : the ceremony lasts a day and night , and the women will stay standing for the whole of it before dancing with the men dancing : pokot girls and boys dance together during an initiation ceremony of over a hundred girls passing over into womanhood if the girls do not die , then the stitches can cause them terrible pain and discomfort for the rest of their lives , especially during childbirth			1
as with child marriage , the practice has now been outlawed in @entity2 , with a maximum penalty of life in jail if a girl dies , but so far there have been no successful prosecutions			2
between @entity2 and @entity259 there are around 700,000 native pokot speakers , with the vast majority living in @entity262			0
pokot society is largely divided in two between the hills @entity23 , who live in rainy uplands and are mostly farmers , and the plains @entity23 , who roam the dry lowlands and are mostly cattle herders			0
ancient : there are around 700,000 native @entity23 speakers living between @entity2 and @entity259 , with the vast majority living in @entity262 @entity275 : pokot society is split into hill dwellers , who live on rainy uplands and are mostly farmers , and plains dwellers , who live in the bush divide : plains dwellers , like these @entity23 , are mostly cattle herders who roam the landscape looking for grazing lands for the animals event : hundreds of pokot tribesmen and woman gather in their village for the ceremony that will see the girls become women payment : a father inspects his newly - acquired cows after he sold his daughter for a dowry of livestock including camels and goats			1

girls as young as 14 are pictured being carried away by their new husbands after being bargained for livestock
