i also admit that i can sometimes be impatient and short - tempered when i consider i am being prevented from going about my legitimate business			0
' i even admit that i can be , or at least that i can appear to be , rude on these occasions			0
' to the best of my recollection , i have never called anybody a pleb , let alone a policeman			0

it just is n’t a word i use			2
