by @entity1 reporter published : 15:38 est , 10 january 2013 updated : 06:34 est , 11 january 2013 everyone has had to deal a delayed flight and the headache it produces			0
the seemingly constant problem in air travel in the @entity8 is n't just an inconvenience , one study found that it drains $ 40 billion from the economy every year			2
a group of academics ran computer simulations on six million flights at over 300 airports in 2010 to determine how each delay spreads throughout the entire system and causes further problems			2
slowdown : the computer simulation shows scattered flight delays across the @entity8 the knock - on effect : three days later , the number of flight delays has increased and spread coast to coast better days : this chart shows one day where air travel was relatively on - time the researchers , led by @entity30 from the @entity31 and @entity32 in @entity33 , used computer models that are similar to how the spread of diseases or wildfire are monitored			1
their paper , published today , has the potential to help airlines change their schedules in advance to anticipate and prevent delays before they happen			0
the worst contributor to delays is flight crews and passengers missing their connecting flights , which makes sense since a plane can not takeoff if its pilot is n't available			1
flight crews and passengers that are delayed from another flight is the greatest contributor to spreading delays nationwide			1
airport congestion prevents flights from taking off because too many planes are competing for runways			0
scheduling connecting flights without enough time between legs			1
weather and labor problems also spread delays but not as seriously			1
the other two main problems are schedules that are too tight and airport congestion			0
the scheduling issue occurs when one leg of a connecting flight is unable to land on time , throwing a wrench into other scheduled takeoffs			2
and congestion at runways creates more delays because many airports can not handle the amount of planes that need to take off at a given time			0
the study showed that problems like bad weather and labor disruptions are n't as significant in spreading delays since they tend to occur in smaller clusters and do n't create system - wide headaches			1
it also demonstrated how the problems typically do not have lasting effects from one day to the other since the causes of delays begin again each day			0
passing the time : flyers waiting to board a plane at @entity96 in @entity97 check their phones not going anywhere : passengers wait around in droves for their planes at @entity104 's @entity103			0

flight crews unable to make connecting flights is single biggest contributor to delays
researchers examined @entity113 flights in the @entity8 in 2010 for their results
weather and labor problems are n't as serious since they tend to create problems in smaller areas
