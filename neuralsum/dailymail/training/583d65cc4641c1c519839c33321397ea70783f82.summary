a one - armed man whose missing limb was severed from the shoulder in a freak biking accident has invented a prosthetic replacement which enables him to fly a plane			1
@entity7 's right arm was torn off by another rider 's foot peg during a collision over 30 years ago , and attempts to reattach his limb proved unsuccessful			1
since his crash , mr @entity7 , 51 , has never worn a prosthetic arm but he realised he would need one if he wanted accomplish his lifelong dream of earning his private flying licence			1
now , after almost a year hard at work , mr @entity7 , who fixes vintage jukeboxes in his spare time , has a working prototype which was signed off by an aviation medical examiner two weeks ago			1
this means he will be able finally get his solo flying hours and , all being well , his licence			2
at the age of 18 in 1982 , a mid-air crash on his bike left him critically injured with damaged lungs , spleen and liver , a broken leg and most crucially - a severed arm			1
his torn - off limb was found 100 metres away , too damaged to be reattached , and his missing body part changed his life forever			2
mr @entity7 , from @entity55 , @entity56 , said : ' the day of the accident was the day my life changed for ever , but surprisingly it was a positive thing			1
as i lay in hospital i 'd been told i 'd lost my arm but i did n't believe it as i could still " feel " it			0
the unique prosthetic flying arm ( pictured ) created by mr @entity7 was constructed out of aluminium and has a special jacket which he claims makes him look like @entity66 the prosthetic limb was specifically designed to be used to operate a plane			1
while he could fly one - armed as a co-pilot , he needed a functional second arm to fly solo ' it was n't until a nurse took me into the bathroom for the first time that i realised the truth			1
but , as i looked in the mirror a wave of euphoria washed over me			0
' i walked out of that bathroom a new person			0
i had gone in as a spotty , ugly , shy , boy with no confidence and walked out as a strong young man who had already survived against all the odds			0
' as a young man he had been so afraid of flying he needed a course of hypnotherapy to board a plane			0
but on a whim following the accident , he applied to the @entity92 ( @entity92 ) - and in 2012 , was accepted			2
however , when he started flying in 2012 , the prosthetic limb he was using fell off each time he tried to operate the joystick , making flying as a one - armed pilot impossible			1
undaunted , he scrapped the false arm , and decided he would solve the problem himself			2
he suspended his lessons until he could make himself a new arm that was up to the job			0
he tried out two arms the @entity31 had given him but found he could n't use them to fly			2
he had flown co-pilot for several months without a prosthetic , but he needed the new arm to fly solo			2
mr @entity7 believes that a number of ' unique features ' make his Â£ 200 arm stand out from anything else at present			1
mr @entity7 pictured working as a mechanic in the first few years after losing his arm as a young man , mr @entity7 ( pictured left and right ) was motorbike - mad			1
but in 1982 , a mid-air crash on his bike left him critically injured with damaged lungs , spleen and liver , a broken leg and a severed arm a prosthetic arm given to mr @entity7 by the @entity31 ( pictured ) kept falling off while he was flying , so he solved the problem by building his own he said : ' i basically bought a milling machine and a lathe and started making components out of aluminium and putting them together			1
' it has all been made by me , nothing is shop bought			0
i actually had to design some parts because they did n't exist before			0
' it has a very special shoulder socket that i have a patent on now , i also had to design a special jacket so that arm can fit over it			0
i look a bit like @entity66			0
' he explained that his arm has a quick - release shoulder socket , which means if he gets in trouble he can unattached it quickly			2
' people do n't think about getting out of them quickly but you do n't want to be stuck if you are in trouble in a plane			0
it also has positive locking on the shoulder and it can fully rotate as well			0
' mr @entity7 said the unique arm took him around 12 months to put together - but he took his time as he was hoping the arms on offer by the @entity31 might have fit the bill			1
mr @entity7 now works as a motivational speaker and says : ' if i can achieve all of these things with one arm , what are you capable of achieving with two ? ' he added : ' i 've spoken to lots of different groups about how everyone is capable of overcoming obstacles and building their own future			1
' i say to them , if i can achieve all of these things with one arm , what are you capable of achieving with two ? ' ' i 've met people who had obstacles in their way which did n't exist , just like my right arm			2
it 's just a question of overcoming them			0
' with passion , determination and the right attitude you can achieve anything you put your mind to			0
' mr @entity7 now needs to fly ten hours solo and carry out various navigation tests before he is a fully qualified pilot .			0

@entity7 's right arm was severed in a freak bike accident aged 18
but the 51 - year - old decided to not let it stop him pursuing his dreams
he signed up for a flying course designed for people who are disabled
but the @entity31 prosthetic arm kept falling off when he *wrestled* with controls
he has now designed and built his own functional prosthetic flying limb
it was given the all - clear by an aviation medical examiner two weeks ago
he 's now able to use the patented prototype to earn private flying licence
