the @entity0 is set to stop arresting people who are caught with small amounts of marijuana in their possession and will issue tickets instead			1
the move would see those who have previously been handcuffed and taken to a police station being given court summons instead			1
police commissioner @entity10 announced that the official change to the city 's marijuana policy will take effect november 19			1
changes : police commissioner @entity10 , pictured holding up a bag or marijuana alongside mayor @entity18 , announced that minor marijuana possession will no longer lead to arrest but court summons instead he said at a press conference on monday : ' make no mistake , marijuana is still illegal in @entity23			1
people smoking marijuana in public will continue to be arrested			2
' but possession of small amounts , with certain exceptions , is not considered a high enough level of offense to merit the time and resources the @entity0 spends when arresting people , or the potential associated consequences of criminal justice involvement for the arrestees			1
mayor @entity18 added : ' this new policy will reduce unnecessary arrests for minor marijuana possession and put an end to an era where many of young @entity23 were being arrested and saddled with criminal records for minor violations			2
' today 's action is the latest in a series of steps @entity47 and i have taken to rebuild the relationship between the @entity0 and the communities they serve			0
' we are also enhancing public safety with this new initiative by directing police resources towards more serious crime , and not wasting officer time processing unnecessary arrests			0
' in the first 10 months of 2014 , the @entity0 has received approximately 23,000 911 or 311 calls from @entity23 complaining about the sale or public smoking of marijuana in their neighborhoods			2
this is almost a 30 per cent increase over last year			0
@entity0 commissioner @entity10 points to a chart on marijuana arrests during a news conference			1
the city has seen a 30 per cent increase in people complaining about sales of marijuana in their neighborhoods the new summons policy reflects the distinction @entity23 make between the more significant crimes of smoking and dealing , and possession of small amounts of marijuana according to the @entity84 , suspects caught carrying under 25 grams of the drug on their person ' may be eligible ' , however people caught burning or smoking it will still be arrested			1
it would be a significant step towards to addressing the department 's controversial stop - and - frisk policy			0
in may it was reported that minor marijuana arrests in @entity23 have plunged in recent years amid questions about police tactics			0
however statistics showed the arrests dropped more modestly in the first three months of @entity18 's adminisration , even after pledges to reduce them			0
new guidelines : the mayor 's office tweeted as the announcement was being made arrests for the lowest - level marijuana crime fell 34 percent in the first quarter of 2013 — and 9 percent in the first quarter of this year , to roughly 7,000 , according to state division of criminal justice services data			0
since 1977 , @entity107 has considered possession of less than 25 grams ( about 7/8 of an ounce ) a non-criminal violation akin to a traffic ticket — unless the drug is ' open to public view			1
' in those cases , it 's a misdemeanor , spurring an arrest record and potentially three months in jail , though many cases get dismissed if defendants avoid rearrest			0
the arrests averaged about 2,100 a year from 1978 through 1995 , but more than 36,700 per year from 1996 through 2011			2
federal data show marijuana use nationwide has risen , but far less dramatically , during the last decade			0
after the arrests — and outcry — hit a high in 2011 , the arrests plummeted from about 50,700 then to 28,600 last year .			2

people caught carrying under 25 grams of the drug will be given summons
before the move they would have been handcuffed and taken to a station
commissioner @entity10 said those caught smoking it will still be arrested
between 1996 and 2011 , 36,700 people a year were arrested for possession of small amounts
