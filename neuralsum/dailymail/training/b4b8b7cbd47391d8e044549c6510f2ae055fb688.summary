@entity0 have one foot in the @entity2 final after beating @entity3 3 - 1 at the @entity4 on wednesday night			1
the second leg of the semi-final should be a formality and they continue to show the sort of form that will have @entity11 nervously looking over their shoulder in the league where the difference is just one point			0
@entity0 ’s front three of @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 have now scored more goals in 2015 than the entire @entity11 team			1
@entity17 got one here and @entity18 should have added to his tally but missed from the spot			2
@entity19 did not score but was involved in two of the three goals as @entity27 and @entity28 also scored to record their 10th consecutive victory in all competitions			1
@entity0 's @entity17 celebrates scoring against @entity3 with @entity19 ( right ) at the @entity4 @entity17 and @entity19 ( left ) celebrate at the @entity4 as @entity0 beat @entity3 in the @entity2 semi-final first leg @entity17 hugs @entity19 as the pair ran riot over @entity3 at the @entity4 for @entity36 giants @entity0 @entity0 beat @entity3 at the @entity4 in the @entity2 semi-final first leg @entity17 gives a thumbs up as he and his @entity0 team - mates beat @entity3 @entity0 : @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity28 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 ( @entity45 69 ) , @entity46 , @entity27 , @entity17 , @entity19 , @entity18 subs not used : asip , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 goals : @entity17 ( 41 ) , @entity27 ( 49 ) , @entity28 ( 65 ) bookings : @entity19 @entity3 : @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 ( @entity63 33 ) , @entity64 ( @entity65 74 ) , @entity66 ( @entity67 52 ) , @entity68 subs not used : @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 goals : @entity75 ( 48 ) bookings : @entity61 , @entity58 , @entity57 @entity3 looked like they had come to not lose too heavily and give themselves a chance in the second leg			1
they defended deeply and @entity0 struggled to break them down for most of the first half			2
@entity19 was found by @entity41 at the back post but failed to get any direction on the finish			0
he then just failed to connect with a @entity17 cross as @entity0 continued to take the game to the visitors			1
there was even a rare sliced effort from @entity17 as @entity0 looked for the first goal			1
when it came it did come from @entity17 but it was @entity19 who took the plaudits			2
he chased down @entity94 robbing the @entity95 before scurrying into the penalty area with @entity17 now in support			2
the old @entity98 would have gone for goal but he dutifully played the @entity95 in and with crisp finish he put @entity0 1 - 0 ahead			1
the crowd responded by singing the assist provider ’s name and not @entity17 ’s			0
@entity17 almost returned the favour immediately but @entity19 just pulled his cross-shot wide of @entity55 ’s goal			0
@entity3 had offered little going forward but still could have gone in level but for the brilliance of @entity40			0
the @entity109 got down sharply to his right to stop @entity112 ’s shot from @entity64 ’s cross			0
if he ended the half brightly @entity40 started the second period by picking the ball out of the back of his net after substitute @entity63 had hit a spectacular shot from distance that left the keeper with no chance			0
@entity0 ’s response was immediate			0
@entity19 was again involved in the build - up playing a one - two inside the penalty area with @entity27			2
the midfielder tried a second wall pass			0
this time the ball came back off of full - back @entity56 into the path of @entity27 once more and he made it 2 - 1			1
@entity27 of @entity0 celebrates after scoring during the @entity2 semi-final first leg match against @entity3 @entity19 reaches for the ball during the @entity2 semi-final first leg at the @entity4 @entity18 was in action for @entity0 as they won the @entity2 semi-final first leg on 70 minutes @entity0 made it three and this time @entity28 did the damage			1
@entity57 was all over the @entity0 defender but @entity28 held him off , and rose above him to bury a header past @entity55			1
it should then have been three with @entity0 fizzing the ball around in the @entity3 penalty area until it cannoned off of @entity57 ’s hand for a penalty			1
@entity17 allowed @entity18 to take the kick and regretted it as the @entity149 followed an elaborate run - up with a weak shot that was saved by @entity55			2
@entity19 was booked for dissent late on and could have added a fourth when he shot from inside the centre - circle but the ball bounced just wide of @entity55 's empty goal			0
the last missed chances will surely not affect the tie			0
@entity0 should progress when the two play the second leg in the first week of march			0
they look like going from crisis to @entity161 in just three months			0
@entity28 runs away in celebration after scoring at the @entity4 for @entity0 @entity18 missed a penalty in the second half as @entity0 won 3 - 1 against @entity3			1

@entity17 opened the scoring for @entity0 at the @entity4 in the 41st minute
@entity3 equalised *shortly* afterwards through @entity63
@entity27 gave @entity0 the lead just a minute later before @entity28 made it 3 - 1
it was @entity0 's 10th win in a row in all competitions
