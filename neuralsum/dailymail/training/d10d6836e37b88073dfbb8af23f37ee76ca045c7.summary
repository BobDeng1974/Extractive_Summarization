by @entity0 the @entity1 is proud to be running the seventh @entity2 , in association with @entity4 and homelessness charity shelter			1
over the next weeks , we want you to nominate special women who deserve recognition			1
here is the story of one remarkable nominee ... @entity13 will do a triathlon every morning until she turns 75 as she nears the age of 75 , when most pensioners would look forward to putting their feet up and dunking a digestive into a nice cup of tea , @entity13 is lacing up her running shoes and preparing to celebrate her birthday in her own indomitable fashion			1
at just 5ft 2ins tall , this extraordinary human powerhouse is planning to undertake a triathlon on every single morning of the entire 75 days running up to her landmark birthday			1
this means each day for two - and - a - half months leading up to 14 august 2014 , @entity27 will swim 1,000 metres in her local pool , ride eight miles on her bike and ' wind down ' with a run of almost two miles along the seafront in @entity34 , @entity35			1
@entity27 's extraordinary challenge will raise money for her local children 's hospice			1
' i want to raise well over £ 1,000 for @entity41 - the only children 's hospice in @entity44 - and i 'll nag everybody silly until i do , ' she says with a twinkle in her eye			1
taking the easy option has never been on @entity27 's agenda			1
her core of inner steel has powered her through more than 250 triathlons and 18 ' extreme ' fitness endurance tests known as @entity55 challenges			1
normally , such extreme challenges - undertaken in the searing heat of foreign shores and often amid perilous mountain terrain - are the reserve of 6ft - tall fitness instructors and soldiers from elite forces			1
but @entity27 's neat grey crop , tiny frame and cheerful smile have become familiar fixtures on starting lines around the world			1
she tirelessly raises money for charity , and says : ' i first went to visit the local children 's hospice several years ago			1
i saw such sadness and love there , it moved me to tears			1
i thought " i 've got to do everything i can for these brave children and their families			1
" ' taking the easy option has never been on @entity27 's agenda : her core of inner steel has powered her through more than 250 triathlons and 18 ' extreme ' fitness endurance tests known as @entity55 challenges if she 's not raising money for the hospice , @entity27 is helping other adults - many of whom have lost their way and their confidence			1
she tirelessly helps to teach women beginners to swim and hundreds of others to keep fit , and blazes a trail encouraging women and men over a certain age to get up from the sofa			1
watching @entity27 sprint down the road it 's hard to believe that 24 years ago she was so unfit she could hardly climb the stairs without becoming breathless			1
@entity109 , who lives with her antique dealer husband of 35 years , @entity110 , says : ' i floated past my 40th birthday without being bothered at all			2
my daughter was grown up , and i enjoyed a quiet life with @entity110			2
@entity27 tirelessly helps to teach women beginners to swim and hundreds of others to keep fit , and blazes a trail encouraging women and men over a certain age to get up from the sofa ' but as i neared my 50th birthday , the impact of my age suddenly hit me			2
i thought ' @entity125 , it 's half a century			1
' i imagined my life as a spiral staircase , with me sliding down			2
i remember thinking ' i 've got to claw my way back up			2
' my hobbies were reading , watching television and tinkering in the garden			2
i did no sport or keep - fit at all , and although i 'm not tall , i weighed 11 stone			2
i joined a local gym and started to get a little fitter , but one day the manager came up and said ' i 've never seen you on the treadmill			1
' ' i said firmly " oh , i do n't do running			2
" but he persuaded me to jump on and run for the first time in my life			2
it was an extraordinary feeling			2
i felt as if my lungs were inflating for the first time			2
' @entity109 's story might have ended with sedate workouts at the gym – but then a young friend mentioned a triathlon			1
@entity109 's story might have ended with sedate workouts at the gym ¿ but then a young friend mentioned a triathlon @entity27 leapt at the challenge			1
she says : ' i thought " that sounds rather jolly , " so at the age of 51 , i found myself taking part in my first triathlon , in @entity157 , @entity158			1
i did n't think there was anything unusual about me taking part , but it caused a stir on the starting line , and i realised i was quite a bit older than the other ladies taking part			2
' it simply made me all the more determined to prove myself			2
by the time i finished , i was hooked			2
' eighteen months and several triathlons later , @entity27 , 53 at the time , was ready for a more extreme event - the ultimate @entity55 challenge of a 2.4 mile swim , a 112 - mile bicycle ride and finally a 26.2 mile run			1
@entity27 almost completed the @entity175 in 17 hours			0
but collapsed just five miles from the finishing line - and immediately decided to sign up for another the following year			1
she adds : ' they are tough , and at times i feel like my lungs are bursting			0
i suffer from asthma , so it can be a real challenge			0
when i feel i ca n't go on , i push one leg in front of the other - and overcome it			0
the feeling of exhilaration at the end is worth every moment of pain			0
' @entity109 said : ' they are tough , and at times i feel like my lungs are bursting			0
i suffer from asthma , so it can be a real challenge			0
when i feel i ca n't go on , i push one leg in front of the other - and overcome it ' she now tackles ten triathlons a year and runs for the @entity198 team			1
' someone said i should publicise my races , to encourage other women of my age group to get fit			0
i started doing little pieces for the local paper , and sure enough , more women began entering triathlons , ' she says			0
' younger women often come up and say “ i read about you and decided to try this for myself			0
” ' just the other week , when i was competing in a triathlon , a man jogged past me and did a double take			1
he was red and sweating and he said ' you 're the reason i 'm suffering like this ! ' apparently , he had seen a piece about me on the wall of his gym , and had thought ' if she can do that , so can i ! ' for 12 years , she has also run free keep - fit classes for women who are complete beginners - working with them for eight weeks to improve their fitness and self - esteem			0
@entity109 says : ' i 've helped more than 100 women of all ages improve their fitness and in some cases , it literally transforms their life			0
@entity109 has also coached a swimming group which included disabled athletes , and helped one friend with cerebral palsy who could hardly walk to take her first tentative steps on a track			0
for 12 years , she has also run free keep - fit classes for women who are complete beginners - working with them for eight weeks to improve their fitness and self - esteem @entity109 says : ' gradually , she took her first running steps and it was fabulous to watch			0
eventually , she completed her own triathlon			1
to see her delight was worth every second			0
' in may this year , @entity109 broke an arm , a foot and her hand in a fall in @entity250			0
she says : ' i was so cross with myself			0
i was looking at @entity251 in the distance when i put my foot in a hole in the ground and fell			0
' ' we had to hail a taxi and the driver took one look at me and said ' hospital '			0
i said ' oh no you do n't ! ' i did n't want to be trapped in a hospital so far away from home			0
' so she endured the pain until she returned home three days later			0
i was so fed up because it meant i could n't train			0
so i challenged myself to write a poem every day , to put in a book and sell to raise money for the hospice			1
' when the plaster came off , @entity109 returned to her training and just one month later , represented @entity273 in the @entity275 world championships			0
@entity109 said : ' we 're in our 70s , but we 're young at heart and we have steel in our soul			0
everyone my age is capable of making their mark and helping this world be a far nicer place ' somehow @entity27 also manages to care for her 93 - year - old bed - bound mother - in - law			0
she says : ' i do n't think that i am extraordinary , but i am part of an extraordinary generation - the absolute backbone of this country			0
' we 're in our 70s , but we 're young at heart and we have steel in our soul			0
everyone my age is capable of making their mark and helping this world be a far nicer place			0
' with a spring in her every step , @entity27 is an inspiration to us all .			0
