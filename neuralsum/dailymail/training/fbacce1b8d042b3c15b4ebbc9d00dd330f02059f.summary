by @entity0 published : 10:49 est , 9 april 2013 updated : 11:17 est , 9 april 2013 it looks as though a lumberjack got halfway through chopping down this tree and just gave up			0
but in fact the damage to this @entity6 birch has been caused by beavers			2
the large , flat - tailed , semi-aquatic rodents are more usually associated with @entity10 after the @entity12 variety was practically hunted to extinction			1
timber ! a birch gnawed by beavers stands near @entity16 , in @entity17 , southern @entity6			1
the animals , once hunted to near extinction in @entity12 , have been reintroduced to the area in @entity6 since 1979 , however , there has been a programme to reintroduce the animals - resulting in the horrendous damage to this birch in @entity17 's @entity27 municipality			1
the animals like to snack on the bark of trees - particularly birch - resulting in this ' ringing ' effect as they chew all the way around the trunk as high as they can reach			0
but although these pictures might suggest otherwise , beavers are in fact good for woodland habitats , even trees			1
often regarded as nature 's engineers , @entity41 are known for building dams on rivers and streams , and building their homes - known as ' lodges ' - in the resulting pond			0
tough love : although these pictures might suggest otherwise , beavers are in fact good for woodland habitats , even trees remarkably , the resourceful rodents also build canals to float building materials that are too heavy or unwieldy for them to haul over land			1
it 's through this natural tendency to build waterworks that beavers are a benefit to the woodlands where they are native			0
their building efforts sponge up floodwaters , alleviate droughts and floods ( because their dams keep water on the land longer ) , lesson erosion , and raise the water table , according to @entity41 : @entity78			2
@entity80 's constructions also act as the ' earth 's kidneys ' to purify water because silt collects upstream of older beaver dams , and toxic chemicals , such as pesticides , are broken down by microbes in the wetlands created			0
that means that water downstream of dams is cleaner and needs less treatment for human use			0
conservation efforts : a photo issued by the @entity97 of a beaver kit with an adult after the creatures were reintroduced to @entity101 , @entity102 , in recent years populations of eurasian beaver are recovering , aided by conservation efforts , after the species was nearly hunted to extinction in @entity12 for its fur and for scent gland secretions once believed to have healing qualities			1
because of these pressures , the beaver became extinct in @entity113 in the sixteenth century			0
however , several thousand now live on the @entity114 , the @entity115 and in parts of @entity117 , and they have been reintroduced in @entity118 , @entity17 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 .			2

beavers were once hunted almost to extinction in @entity12 for their fur
the damage to this tree comes after they were reintroduced to @entity17
*resettlement* efforts are also taking place in the @entity135
@entity41 ' *extraordinary* constructions are beneficial to woodland habitats
