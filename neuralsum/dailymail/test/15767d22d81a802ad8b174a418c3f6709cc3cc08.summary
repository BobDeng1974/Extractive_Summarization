the idea that your tongue is separated into ‘ zones ’ for different tastes has been widely debunked - although the exact process taking place is still poorly understood			1
but now , for the first time , scientists have created a live imaging map of the tongue 's taste buds to determine what happens each time we place food in our mouths			1
it reveals how taste buds have different cells that are used to differentiate between between the five basic groups of flavours			1
a @entity23 - led study has mapped taste buds on a tongue for the first time			1
scientists examined the different cells used to identify taste and watched these cells capture and process molecules live			1
shown is a taste bud with receptor cells ( green ) , blood cells ( red ) and collagen surrounding the bud ( blue ) the research was conducted by an international team that included the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) and the @entity39			2
they used a specially designed microscope system to image single cells on the tongue of a mouse			0
shining a bright infrared laser on the mouse ’s tongue caused different parts of it and ‘ flavour molecules ’ to fluoresce			0
penguins lost three of the five basic vertebrate tastes - sweet , bitter and the savoury , meaty taste known as umami - more than 20 million years ago and never regained them , researchers have found			1
researchers say the genes were lost after cold @entity59 temperatures interfered with taste perception			0
@entity62 researchers said they were surprised by the discovery because penguins are fish eaters , the loss of the umami taste is especially perplexing , said study leader dr @entity68 , a professor in the @entity69			2
dr @entity68 suspects the sensory changes are tied to ancient climate - cooling events in @entity59 , where penguins originated			0
using a method called intravital multiphoton microscopy , the scientists were then able to pick out individual taste cells within each bud			2
they were also able to spot blood vessels up to 240 microns - 240 millionths of a metre ( 0.0024mm ) - below the surface of the tongue			0
‘ we 've watched live taste cells capture and process molecules with different tastes , ’ said biomedical engineer dr @entity83 , from @entity38			1
there are more than 2,000 taste buds on the human tongue , which can distinguish at least five tastes : salty , sweet , sour , bitter and umami - a word used to describe smooth and typically savoury , meaty sensations			1
however , the relationship between the many taste cells within a taste bud , and our perception of taste , has been a long - standing mystery , said professor @entity102 from @entity39			2
‘ with this new imaging tool we have shown that each taste bud contains taste cells for different tastes , ’ said professor @entity102			0
the breakthrough complements recent studies by other research groups that identified the areas in the brain associated with taste			0
interestingly , the results showed that taste cells respond not only to molecules contacting the surface of the tongue , but also to molecules in the blood circulation			1
the researchers used a specially designed microscope system to image single cells on the tongue of a mouse			2
shining a bright infrared laser on the mouse ’s tongue caused different parts of it to fluoresce			0
the tongue is shown here , with taste buds in blue , among yellow papillae , or small bumps in the tongue 's tissue using a method called intravital multiphoton microscopy , the scientists were able to pick out individual taste cells within each taste bud			1
dr @entity83 from @entity38 ( @entity38 ) is seen here working on a laser microscope system at the @entity140 according to assistant professor @entity144 ( @entity143 ) @entity142 from the @entity145 in @entity146 , this suggests tasting might ‘ involve an interaction between the food taken orally and blood composition			0
’ the team now hopes to develop an experiment to monitor the brain while imaging the tongue to track the full process of taste sensation			1
however to fully understand the complex interactions that form our basic sense of taste could take years , dr @entity83 added			0
‘ until we can simultaneously capture both the neurological and physiological events , we ca n't fully unravel the logic behind taste , ’ he said			0
the findings were published in the journal @entity167 .			0

researchers now want to study how the brain responds to taste
