but according to celebrity chef @entity1 , the true masters of the barbecue are women			1
contrary to generations of received wisdom , the 39 - year - old said female chefs in his @entity17 steak house are much better at managing open flames			1
men , meanwhile , panic if they can not control the heat with a switch			2
he said : ‘ actually some of the best barbecuers are women			2
' when we opened @entity27 , it was the first restaurant in @entity17 that did n’t have gas or electric and for the first month , we just lost 20 male chefs and all that were left largely were women because they were a lot more sensitive to managing fire			1
