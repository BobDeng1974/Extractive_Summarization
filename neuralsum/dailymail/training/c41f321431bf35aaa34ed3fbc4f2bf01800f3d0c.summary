' the security fears come just days after suicide bombers protesting against oppression in the western @entity69 province of @entity70 drove a car into a crowd of tourists in @entity75 ’s @entity74 - the site of the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy protesters by government troops and tanks			1

it comes as @entity2 's top negotiator at international climate talks said on tuesday that air pollution in his own country - the world 's biggest carbon emitter - is harming its citizens			2
' @entity2 indeed is suffering from severe air pollution , ' said @entity164 , vice chairman of the @entity165 , the top economic planning body			2
smoggy conditions have ' now become the norm which has severely affected the mental and physical health of the @entity2 people ' , he added - but voiced hope for improvement in the next decade			0
@entity164 , speaking to reporters before global climate talks in @entity176 next week , attributed @entity2 's air problems to the country 's ' obsolete development model ' , its ' unreasonable industrial and energy structure " and discharge of pollutants by some companies ' in a very extensive way '			1
