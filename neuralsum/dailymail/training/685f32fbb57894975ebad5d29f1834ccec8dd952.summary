@entity0 living in the major cities will pay hundreds of dollars a year more for gas as prices rise			2
a report from the @entity5 says has found that an average household gas bill in most major centres will soar by hundreds of dollars a year			0
in @entity10 the price shock will be double most of the other big cities , the increase is expected to be as much as $ 435 a year and the country 's very strong position in an emerging export industry is to blame			1
@entity0 living in the major cities will pay hundreds of dollars a year more for gas as prices rise @entity18 residents are set to be hit hard with gas bills to jump significantly			1
@entity10 in particular will be hard hit with average household costs increasing as much as $ 435 a year the think - tank 's energy program director , @entity22 , argues the emergence of a @entity26 export industry over the next five years , which could be worth about $ 60 billion a year , will actually push prices up as @entity0 are forced to compete in the international market for supplies			1
@entity0 will also struggle to meet its 2020 emissions reduction target , mr @entity22 warns , as more coal is used for electricity generation in the face of rising gas prices			2
in @entity10 , where 90 per cent of homes use gas for all their cooking , hot water and heating , an average bill could rise be as much as $ 435 a year , he said			2
@entity43 and @entity44 residents can expect a price gouge of more than $ 200 for their annual gas bill but @entity47 is expected to be spared high gas users in @entity43 will face an increase of about $ 225 , while high users in @entity44 will pay an extra $ 200 a year			1
however , people in @entity47 , where gas consumption is low , would not be hit so hard			0

' by 2018 east coast gas , added to growing @entity59 supplies , could create the world 's biggest gas export industry , worth $ 60 billion a year			1
by 2018 planned gas exports from the east coast and @entity59 could make @entity0 's industry worth more than $ 60 billion a year , to the detriment of the domestic market ' the downside is that domestic gas prices will increase to compete with the higher prices that other countries are prepared to pay for our gas			1
' but mr @entity22 says governments should resist pressure to introduce subsidies or the like to protect @entity59 industry and consumers			0
' reserving or subsidising gas for domestic use will add more costs than benefits and do nothing to increase supply			0
and in the long run , protection harms everyone , ' he said			0
the report says that for low users of gas - those using a gas cook - top or small - capacity gas hot water system - the increase to an average bill could be contained to less than $ 50 per year .			0

@entity0 's strong position in the gas export market to blame
most major city households face a *massive* hike in their gas bills
@entity10 gas users to be hit hardest , *forking* out up to $ 435 a year more
@entity47 will be spared
@entity0 's gas export industry expected to be worth $ 60 billion by 2018
