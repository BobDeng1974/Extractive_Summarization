by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:04 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 11:32 est , 5 august 2013 furious town hall leaders have accused ministers of risking ‘ real and permanent damage ’ to @entity8 ’s high streets by suggesting empty shops be turned into homes , councils said the idea floated by @entity12 @entity11 would lead some shopping hubs ‘ being shut down forever ’			1
the minister suggested that the high street is dead , and instead of trying to revive boarded up shops planning rules should be eased to allow them to be turned into houses			1
empty shop on high streets , such as here in @entity23 , one of @entity26 's 12 pilot towns , could be converted into affordable homes ( file photo ) the radical proposal from planning minister mr @entity11 risked contradicting efforts by retail guru @entity26 , who was hired by @entity30 to find a way of reviving dying town centres			1
as a result of her report some £ 1.2million of taxpayer money was shared out between 12 towns for initiatives to inject new life into their traditional shopping high streets			1
but mr @entity11 suggested that internet shopping and changes in lifestyles and working patterns meant the traditional town centre was a thing of the past			1
' we want to encourage local councils to concentrate retail activity into the prime shopping streets in the heart of their town centres and adopt a more relaxed approach to under - used retail frontages , ’ he said			1
planning minister @entity11 said councils need to think ' creatively ' about how to revive flagging @entity59 local authorities would be given more freedom to convert shops into housing , with retail concentrated on one or two ‘ prime streets ’ to end the ‘ long straggly shopping streets heading out of town ’ but the idea was condemned by the @entity69 , which accused mr @entity11 of acting to kill off the high street altogether			1
@entity71 , chairman of the @entity69 ’s environment and housing board , said : ‘ councils are working locally to improve high streets			1
‘ this national intervention could undermine that and lead to some shopping hubs being shut down forever with residents and businesses left powerless to raise an objection			0
this could drain the life from our high streets			1
‘ instead of risking real and permanent damage by imposing this on the whole country , government should trust local areas to decide for themselves where relaxing planning rules would be beneficial			1
’ he warned that the stripping away of planning rules will ‘ undermine people ’s right to have a say on significant changes to their local neighbourhoods and high streets ’			1
@entity101 's key recommendations , which included cutting business rates and putting a brake on new shopping centres , have both been rejected			1
mr @entity11 said that planners most respond ' creatively ' to shifts in the way today 's consumers shop			1
allowing redundant shops to be converted into homes could ease pressure on greenfield sites for residential developments			2
retail consultant @entity26 became a @entity115 advisor on how to rescue the @entity116 , but many of her key recommendations have been ignored the planning minister said : ' @entity121 shopping habits are changing very fast as a result of the rise in internet shopping and changes in lifestyles and working patterns			1
' we need to think creatively about how to help town centres thrive in this new era			0
' we want to encourage local councils to concentrate retail activity into the prime shopping streets in the heart of their town centres and adopt a more relaxed approach to under - used retail frontages			1
' ms @entity26 expressed concern that councils would choose the ' easy option ' of turning units into housing and said that losing the high street would be ' one of the greatest social crimes in our country			1
' mr @entity11 also indicated that councils are to be encouraged to allow farmers to convert old agricultural buildings into homes			1
' we want to make the best use of existing buildings in the countryside to meet the desperate need for affordable housing in rural communities , ' he said			0
' the more redundant barns that can be converted into homes for young families , the more we can protect green fields from development			0
' earlier this week , a @entity160 forced by soaring costs to shut his flagship shop warned that the @entity8 high street is almost dead			1
@entity164 , whose store was in chancellor @entity167 ’s constituency , says small businesses are being forced out as their profits are squeezed			0
he was left with £ 100 for himself ‘ in a good week ’ after paying rent , business rates and wages , leading him to warn : ‘ before long all that will be left on the @entity8 high street is @entity175 , @entity176 and charity shops – it ’s just impossible for people like me to keep our heads above the water			1
’ ‘ i ’m afraid independent traders on the high street just do n’t have a chance these days in this tough current economic climate			2
‘ my shop was in @entity167 ’s constituency [ @entity190 ]			0
he ought to know the importance of independent businesses and try to do something to help us			0
it ’s the rising cost of everything that is affecting business owners like me			0
‘ the sad part of it is that we ’re not the only business that ’s having to do this			0
it ’s a national problem that is affecting every high street			2
' on a good week we were left with £ 100 - a - week profit and it was just not worth it			2
there seems to be no incentive to operate as an independent on the high street these days			2
chocolatier @entity164 warned that the @entity116 is nearly dead following the closure of his flagship shop in @entity213 , @entity214 ‘ i have to turn over a certain amount just to keep moving , but if i go over that amount suddenly i find myself in a position where i can be taxed more			2
it ’s as though business owners are punished for being successful			0
’ he will now concentrate on the business ’s online operation			2
ms @entity26 condemned the government over a decision to allow @entity175 to build a vast new supermarket on the seafront at @entity23 , one of her pilot towns , in june and accused the government of ' paying lip service ' to the idea of regenerating high streets			1
she has become an outspoken champion of small retailers and fought to try and revive town centres ravaged by the impact of large supermarkets			0
however , she has effectively been overruled by the equally combative @entity237 , the secretary for communities and local government , who has approved the @entity23 scheme			0
the new @entity175 , which had been fought by local residents and traders , will be a massive 82,000 square feet and sit on what is a key site on the seafront			2
councils will be urged to concentrate shops into a main retail area and convert empty units into homes ( file photo ) the news will confirm suspicions that the original decision to hire @entity26 was more of a publicity stunt than a genuine attempt to help struggling high streets			1
in april , ms @entity26 accused the former @entity175 boss , sir @entity258 , of talking ‘ crap ’ when he described the rise of supermarkets as progress			1
she said : ‘ that 's absolutely crap			2
what happens is that 50p of every pound is spent on food			0
' if you take that off the high street and put it into a 40,000ft out - of - town store and you provide free parking and everything under one roof , then you start to take away not only the food shops , but also the chemist , the fashion shops , the butcher … you start to displace the whole high street			2
’ a @entity281 spokesman said : ‘ small businesses are the backbone of the @entity8 economy			0
‘ we know for many that times have been tough			0
the government has focused what help we can give on small businesses			0
’ small businesses have been hit by a double whammy of punishing business rates and a persistent reluctance from banks to lend to them , writes @entity0 , @entity1 's political editor			2
the economic recovery has continued since the start of the year - growth hit 0.6 per cent the three months to june , double the rate seen in the first quarter			0
but even with more customers willing to spend , many small firms are struggling to make ends meet			0
latest figures show banks cut back lending to small business in 80 per cent of the country 's 120 postcodes from 2011 to 2012			0
only 22 towns and cities saw lending increase , despite government pressure on the banks to increase funding for struggling companies			2
business secretary @entity318 said it was ' frustrating '			0
at the same time business rates charges imposed by councils on company premises wipe out a growing slice of any profits			0
the @entity325 found one in 14 companies now spend more on business rates than on rent			0
with another rise in rates due in september , it is feared more companies could go bust .			0

@entity11 said council should concentrate shops in ' prime ' locations
but @entity69 warned it would cause ' real damage '
£ 1.2m was given to 12 towns to help high streets but many are struggling
key advice from retail guru @entity26 's report have been ignored
