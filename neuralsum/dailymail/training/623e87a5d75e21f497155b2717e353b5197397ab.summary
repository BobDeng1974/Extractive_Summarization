this past weekend at the @entity3 , only one bodybuilder among hundreds of the men and women competing got a standing ovation			1
though she did n't win any major awards , armless bodybuilder @entity5 had the @entity9 , @entity8 crowd cheering and on their feet			1
the 37 - year - old mother - of - two lost both her arms during a horrific electrical accident as a toddler - but that has n't stopped her from pursuing her bodybuilding dream			1
' the only limitations are the ones you put on yourself			1
everyone has limitations and handicaps in some way or another - mine are more visible than yours maybe			2
' competition organizer , @entity40 , was first introduced to @entity21 when she requested that her trainer be allowed to come backstage - a request he normally rejects			2
but was astonished when she said : ' i need him to help me put on my costume			2
it 's because i have no arms			1
' they have been firm friends ever since			2
no limitations : @entity21 , pictured on stage this weekend , believes you can do whatever you put your mind to experienced : @entity21 entered her first competition in 2003 and has been hooked ever since standing strong : @entity21 ( far right ) can hold her own against the competition , despite having no arms @entity21 says she can do anything an average person can do - except she uses her feet			1
that includes brushing her teeth , making dinner , taking milk out of the fridge , texting , shopping , putting on makeup and even driving			2
' everyone has limitations and handicaps in some way or another - mine are more visible than yours maybe ' the single mom - who has been married three times - began bodybuilding back in 2003			2
she said : ' i used to read about all the fitness competitors in magazines - and i thought that was the coolest thing ever			2
i wanted to be like them and do the things they were doing			2
i thought it was amazing			0
' @entity21 decided to take the plunge into the sport after years of doubting herself and wondering if she 'd even qualify because she did n't have arms to do the competition mandatories : ' i finally called the locale chairperson and talked to him about it ; and he gave me the green light			1
@entity95 factor : @entity21 is a single mother - of - two and has been married three times			0
she says bodybuilding gives her a goal to work towards and makes her feel good about herself tough training : @entity21 's workouts vary each day from cardio and abs to stretching and track work managing motherhood : @entity21 admits there are certain challenges when it comes to raising her two sons , but says she just uses her feet where others might use their hands ' so in 2003 i entered my first fitness competition and loved it			0
now it 's in my blood and i ca n't live without it			1
' @entity21 lost her arms when she was two years old			1
she climbed onto an electrical transformer and grabbed the wires			1
the electricity entered her hands and surged through her body - scorching her arms down to the bone and turning them into something ' like charcoal			1
' rare skill : @entity21 demonstrates how she uses her feet to text on her phone ' the doctor said i would n't live - and if i did live , i 'd probably be a vegetable , ' she said			1
' but @entity135 had a different plan for me ; i 'm still here , healthy , and alive and well			0
' not only is @entity21 alive and well but she continues to push her body to the limits by dancing , swimming and playing soccer			0
' my first few fitness competitions i did get some funny looks , ' she admitted			0
' i 'm sure people were wondering what i thought i was doing up there			0
obviously it 's a physique competition and i 'm missing part of my physique and i do n't have the symmetry of what they are looking for			1
' but after i did my routine for the first time , people realized that i was an athlete just like the rest of them - and i did belong up there			0
' ' i do n't know why they go as crazy as they do for me ; maybe its something different			1
' so far , @entity21 ' greatest bodybuilding victory came in march 2012 , when she came in fifth out of six competitors			0
she added : ' it was actually the first time i placed ahead of people - and that was a big milestone for me			0
even though i still was fifth place , i was happy i placed ahead of someone - someone who actually has two arms and their whole body			1
' bodybuilding gives @entity21 a goal to work towards and makes her feel good about herself			0
her workouts vary each day from cardio and abs to stretching and track work			0
anything is possible : @entity21 believes that the mind is a really very powerful thing - and so is attitude when not competing , @entity21 loves doing the things a normal mom would do and enjoys looking after her two sons			0
she added : ' yes there are the challenges and trials that come with bringing up kids			0
i do n't think mine were any different - i just had to use my feet			1
but i got through it and my kids got through it			0
' ' sometimes i have to sit on the floor or sometimes i have to sit on the counter - but its still the same stuff you do			0
the mind is a really very powerful thing and so is attitude - and if you keep a really positive attitude and believe in yourself and believe that you can - then anything is possible			0
