but there were some non crash - protected system recordings that could be studied along with radio communications and closed circuit tv recordings			0

return journey : helicopter pilot and crash victim @entity57 , 51 , had been on his way back to the @entity47 when the aircraft was seen falling from the sky the @entity16 added that radar contact with the helicopter was lost at 10.22pm			1
the report went on : ' around this time , the helicopter was seen and heard by a witness who described hearing a noise like a loud " misfiring car " , followed by silence			0
' he then saw the helicopter descend rapidly			0
it crashed through the roof of @entity33 , a single - storey building on @entity108 in central @entity7			0

the @entity16 went on : ' preliminary examination showed that all main rotor blades were attached at the time of the impact but that neither the main rotor nor the fenestron tail rotor ( a form of protected tail rotor ) were rotating			1
' the impact forces caused the roof of the bar to collapse and ( the ) helicopter entered the building , its forward section coming to rest on and amongst building debris			0

the helicopter did , however , remain approximately upright			0

the report went on : ' initial assessment provided no evidence of major mechanical disruption of either engine and indicated that the main rotor gearbox was capable of providing drive from the no 2 engine turbine to the main rotor and to the fenestron drive shaft			1
' however , the state of the building limited the extent to which examination of the helicopter was possible at the scene , the @entity16 added			2
the report continued : ' after further debris removal and cutting off the main rotor blade , it was determined that the helicopter structure remained sufficiently robust for it to be lifted clear of the building by means of a crane , using strops attached to the main rotor head			2

the pilots ' union @entity212 said : ' the information published by the @entity16 today is a helpful first assessment of the facts of the case and suggests there is no evidence of mechanical engine failure			1
' but , unfortunately , at this stage , there is not much more to go on and the reasons behind the crash are , in truth , far from clear			0
the @entity16 must be given the time to complete its thorough investigation and we have faith in their ability to do so			1
