why always me ? it was @entity2 who first asked the question of himself , and years later we ’re still no closer to finding an answer			1
the man just seems to be a magnet for everything : good and bad			0
the centre of attention , like he ’s involved in a little exhibition game all of his own			0
and if we thought the white - hot atmosphere of @entity15 ’s @entity14 would make @entity2 rein himself in a little after those penalty shenanigans in the first leg at @entity18 last week , we were very much mistaken			1
@entity19 striker @entity2 looks over at manager @entity20 after being substituted @entity20 failed to acknowledge @entity2 after the striker was taken off in the 82nd minute @entity2 shakes hands with the coaching staff after being replaced by @entity23 @entity2 watches from the bench as the @entity26 tie goes into extra time @entity2 with team - mates and coaching staff during the penalty shootout @entity2 and @entity31 could only watch the penalty shootout as they had been substituted even before a ball had been kicked , as @entity19 ’s players walked out on to the pitch in their tracksuits 90 minutes before kick - off to a cacophony of boos and whistles from a typically hostile @entity44 crowd , the television cameras inevitably zoomed in on the volatile @entity45			1
@entity2 stared impassively ahead , blocking out the noise with the music on his headphones , and then spat on to the pitch as if on cue			2
at that stage we did n’t know that he would be starting alongside @entity31 in attack for only the second time , and the first since a 3 - 0 win at @entity56 at the end of august			1
there are many who have written off @entity2 since then , and who ’s to say @entity19 would n’t have considered cutting their losses and bringing in a replacement in january had @entity31 not missed most of the season through injury ? but @entity20 has persevered with a young man who exasperated even his old mentor @entity66 at @entity67 and there have been encouraging signs in recent weeks , a late winner against @entity56 preceding the only goal against @entity44 at @entity18			1
@entity2 of @entity19 is pushed by @entity71 of @entity44 after accusing @entity72 of diving @entity2 remonstrates with @entity44 defender @entity72 during the @entity26 tie @entity2 was booked by referee @entity75 in the 11th minute for lunge at @entity77 even when he does well , however , @entity2 often finds himself in bother and the talking point after the game was n’t so much his winning penalty as the way he snatched the ball off captain @entity83 to take it and the subsequent criticism from @entity85			1
having ended the first leg in controversy , @entity2 was soon at it again here			2
the game was only moments old when he forgot @entity20 ’s pre-match instructions to be patient and pursued @entity71 towards the @entity44 corner flag , giving the defender a little nudge in the process			2
when @entity71 went sprawling on the turf , @entity2 leaned down to remonstrate with him , raising the decibel level among the home fans even higher , if that were possible			2
the @entity14 is not a place to go looking for trouble at any time , but particularly not on nights like this			0
at times @entity2 seemed to be spoiling for it			2
when he was caught in possession deep inside his own half early on , he responded with a lunging challenge on @entity77 which quite rightly earned him the first yellow card of the night from @entity110 referee @entity75			1
soon afterwards , he went stumbling backwards and fell on his backside while trying to control a relatively simple pass from @entity31			2
@entity2 ’s confidence never wanes , however , even when things are n’t going his way			0
it is a quality of his , even though it did n’t feel that way when he wastefully sent a freekick out of play and then followed it up by firing wildly over the bar from fully 40 yards before half - time			0
@entity2 goes down under the challenge by @entity44 defender @entity71 @entity2 ( left ) appeals to the referee after being fouled in the second half in @entity15 @entity44 midfielder @entity77 feels full force of @entity2 on thursday night it was a more subdued @entity2 after that , even more so when he limped to the touchline after an hour with a foot injury			1
the shoulders began to slump , the head went down			0
we ’ve seen the signs before			0
perhaps restricted by his earlier booking , it was no surprise that his half - hearted attempt at a challenge preceded the goal from @entity140 that levelled the tie in the 72nd minute			0
@entity2 allowed @entity142 to breeze past him on the left , failing to put in even a hint of a challenge as the @entity44 danger man broke into the box and squared for substitute @entity140 to beat @entity149 with a cracking effort			1
ten minutes later the board went up and @entity2 was off , making way for @entity23			1
there was a disbelieving look to the bench and a disconsolate walk to the touchline , helped on his way by a sympathetic pat on the arm from @entity161			0
even though @entity19 needed a goal at that stage , or very possibly a trusted penalty - taker for the shootout , @entity2 ’s contribution had dwindled to such a level that it appeared as if he had little left to offer			0
the look on his face told a different story			0

@entity2 received a yellow card after just 11 minutes
@entity2 and @entity31 were paired up front against @entity44
@entity2 was substituted in the 82nd minute for @entity23
the striker did not look happy to be going off with extra time *looming*
