new boss : oil giant @entity1 has sparked a pay row by handing its new chief executive @entity3 a bumper pay package worth up to £ 29m oil giant @entity1 has sparked a pay row by handing its new chief executive a bumper package worth up to £ 29m , making him one of @entity9 's best - paid oil bosses			1
@entity3 was poached from the far larger @entity11 rival @entity10 to become its chief executive from march next year , with a package that has been criticised as ‘ excessive ’			1
he will be paid £ 1.5million a year , as well as bonuses worth up to £ 3million and another share incentive scheme that could pay out up to £ 9million if he hits performance targets and manages to turn around the flagging @entity18 oil and gas producer , based in @entity19 , @entity20			1
additionally , he could get another £ 12million in shares over the next five years if the pay committee decides he is doing a good job at @entity25 's third - largest energy firm			0
this particular measure is so controversial that the company shareholders are being asked to vote for it at a special meeting			0
@entity1 will also generously compensate @entity3 for the potential share awards he is leaving behind at @entity10 to the tune of £ 3million			1
@entity3 , who celebrates his 52nd birthday today , is also being given £ 480,000 to move his family to @entity18 , and will have £ 450,000 a year put into his pension pot as part of the staggering deal			1
he resigned from his post of ceo of @entity10 with immediate effect yesterday to take up the @entity1 role next year			1
after a run of disappointing candidates , @entity1 insisted it had to pay top whack to get a man suitable to lead the company			2
@entity1 has been struggling following a string of production downgrades that cost the previous ceo , @entity49 his job in april this year			2
@entity49 had himself taken over from long - serving sir @entity51 in early 2013 but there were a number of profit warnings during his time in charge @entity57 , @entity1 ’s executive chairman , defended the pay deal , saying : ‘ the company needs a proven leader from the oil and gas industry to deliver the exceptional opportunities available to it			2
’ @entity64 , deputy director of the independent think tank @entity65 , told @entity66 that the £ 29million pay package used to entice @entity3 to the @entity1 post was ' extraordinary '			1
' to be paying anyone a package worth up to £ 29million is too much to be paying anyone , especially who is a bureaucrat , a manager of a company , ' he said			1
' the fact that it is seen as acceptable , a regular price to pay for a ceo represents a failure for corporate governance across the @entity18 and that the reforms @entity79 introduced are not really working			0
' the business secretary introduced changes which gave shareholders the power to stop pay packages that were too generous , enabling them to vote on company pay policies every three years			0
' if you think about it you could reduce that package by one per cent of £ 29million and it would still put you easily in the top one per cent of @entity18 earners and able to afford a lifestyle beyond the imaginations of most people , ' said mr @entity64			1
' he 's getting 100 times more than someone who would still be seen as incredibly rich - why is that necessary ? ' ' the reforms the government brought in do not seem to have had much effect and the telephone number salaries have not stopped			0
last year for a @entity100 company ceo the going rate was still £ 4 or £ 5million and without further action i do n't think we are going to see executive pay levels come down to something that is fairer and more proportionate			0
' in ten years @entity106 native @entity3 was able to transform @entity11 's once domestic - focused state oil firm into a $ 77 billion global player			1
package : @entity3 , who celebrates his 52nd birthday today , is also being given £ 480,000 to move his family to @entity18 , and will have £ 450,000 a year put into his pension pot as part of the staggering deal last year at @entity10 he had earned a base salary of around £ 720,000 , as part of a total package of a £ 1.3million package			1
' ( @entity3 ) has built a world - class exploration and production portfolio at @entity10 , and the company is now widely admired for its technical expertise , financial performance and strong , values - based culture , ' said mr @entity57			1
@entity1 was formed in 1997 when part of the state - owned @entity127 was privatised and split off from other areas of the business , which now operate as @entity127 and @entity127			0
shares have fallen 20 percent since the start of the year as its important @entity133 gas business performed disastrously due to lower production for exports and its huge investments in @entity137 have yet to prove their value			0
' in terms of global industry leaders , it is hard to imagine a more suitable candidate , ' @entity140 said in a note			0
analysts have suggested that the company might be better focused if it were to spin off either its successful liquefied natural gas ( @entity150 ) business or its deepwater @entity137 interests , which promise more than six billion barrels of oil equivalents in recoverable reserves			0
salary : £ 1.5million per year assorted bonuses : up to £ 3million share incentive scheme : up to £ 9million shares : up to £ 12million ( in shares ) compensation for leaving @entity10 share benefits behind : £ 3million moving his family : £ 480,000 pension : £ 450,000 per year ' for leaders , there comes a time when it 's right to move on , both for themselves and for the company they run , ' said @entity3 , who added that @entity1 had approached him about the role six to eight weeks ago			1
' i 've wanted one more leadership challenge			0
i think i 'm too young to retire			0
this ( @entity1 ) is a challenge i find exciting , and that 's the main motivation			0
' one of @entity1 's biggest future projects may be an lng plant in @entity178 , to be jointly built with @entity10 , after the firms found more than 30 billion cubic feet of gas in several nearby offshore licence areas			2
' @entity1 's key priorities are the delivery of the large new projects , managing decline in its mature regions , the monetisation of some assets and a reinvigoration of its exploration pipeline			0
@entity3 has proved successful at this , while at the helm of @entity10 , ' analysts at @entity193 said in a note			2
@entity10 has already appointed @entity196 , currently head of its marketing , processing and renewables division , as its acting chief executive while the firm searches for a permanent replacement for @entity3 .			2
