by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 ’s @entity2 hopes the fitness problems which cost him a place at the @entity6 in the wake of a ‘ scary ’ collapsed lung are now firmly behind him			1
the former @entity10 captain was diagnosed with the problem at the start of last season having complained of persistent tightness and coughing			1
@entity16 was absent for five weeks and , when he did return , was plagued by niggling injuries for the remainder of the campaign , culminating in him missing out on @entity21 ’s squad for @entity22			1
‘ it was quite scary , ’ said the 25 - year - old reflecting on his collapsed lung just under a year ago			2
‘ it happened at the beginning of the season , and after the collapsed lung i had to be in bed for a couple of weeks			2
‘ looking back , afterwards we did n’t focus enough on my entire body and focused too much on the lung			0
running man : @entity16 competes for the ball in training with @entity54 ‘ the lung was good after three weeks , and the rest of the body just was n’t strong enough to play games , and that ’s what we forgot a little			2
’ he told the @entity61 : ‘ during the season i had some other small injuries which was part of not being strong enough			0
missing out : @entity16 's injury meant he was unable to make the @entity6 in @entity22 ‘ but i think i trained the last half of the year really hard at @entity10 , and now i need a good pre-season to build up strength			1
‘ that ’s what i missed a little bit last year , so it ’s an important time for me to hopefully be stronger than i was			0
