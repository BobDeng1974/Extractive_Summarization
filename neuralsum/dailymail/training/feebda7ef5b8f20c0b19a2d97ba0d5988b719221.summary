@entity0 are set to miss out on their number one left back target @entity2 , after they failed to agree a fee with @entity6 club @entity5			1
the 21 - year - old @entity8 winner has been tracked by @entity9 for some time and although negotiations were lengthy the two have been ' miles apart ' on their valuations of the player with the @entity6 looking for Â£ 20million			0
' the matter of @entity2 is practically settled			1
we could n't reach an agreement and i do n't think it can be revived , ' @entity5 's @entity16 told @entity6 newspaper @entity21			1
top target : @entity2 was identified as @entity0 's top choice at left back but they failed to agree a fee ' it was great offer but the player is only 21 years old and it 's possible that the catharsis of being with the national team had a positive effect			1
' he has a lot of room to grow and the coach is very happy to have him			0
' i do n't think we 'll make a lot of moves but if on august 14 a club comes along and they give you a mountain of cash , well ...			1
i know you do n't like to hear it , but we are economic managers			0
' my feeling is that the negotiations are paralysed and i do n't see any hint that they will be restarted			2
youngster : @entity2 has been linked to many sides and is considered to be one of the best young left backs ' we put a price on our players which we believe to be appropriate			2
whoever wants to buy , can buy , and if you ca n't ...			0
' also , with the sale of @entity59 ( to @entity60 ) our needs were covered			0
we do n't have the ( financial ) burden we had at other times			0
' @entity0 have already signed @entity64 striker @entity63 and @entity66 midfielder @entity65 but are looking to strengthen their defence which was a big weakness as they lost out in the @entity70 title race			1
troubled : @entity9 wo n't have @entity2 to solve his left back woes at @entity72 next season			2

@entity5 chief says negotations are ' paralysed ' with no hope of a restart
@entity0 looking to strengthen defence on return to @entity82
@entity2 now looks unlikely to move unless a ' mountain of cash ' comes in
