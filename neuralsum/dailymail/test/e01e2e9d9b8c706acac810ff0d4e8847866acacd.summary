a recent college graduate diagnosed with genital herpes is stepping into the limelight in attempt to destigmatize @entity4			1
@entity5 , a recent graduate of @entity6 who resides in @entity7 , was diagnosed with herpes two years ago and says she 's been dropping the ' herpes bomb ' about six months after she had her first outbreak			1
in her essay for @entity13 , @entity11 recalls meeting a boy at a party who offered her a sip of his beer			2
i have herpes : @entity5 has genital herpes and she is sharing her story so that less people with the virus can feel the guilt and shame that sometimes accompanies the common skin condition ' do n’t worry , ' she remembers him saying			1
' i do n’t have herpes or anything			2
' his words hit a sore spot for her and she felt compelled to share her sexual health status			2
' " that ’s funny , ’ i said , with as warm a smile as i could manage			0
‘ yeah , that ’s really funny			0
because i have genital herpes			1
not because i grossed him out — i could practically see the wheels turning in his brain as he realized he ’d made an ignorant joke at someone else ’s expense			0
the guy started apologizing profusely , " ' she wrote in her essay			0
@entity11 said that even though herpes is often the bud of the joke in popular culture , it 's a real issue affecting at least one in six @entity57			1
@entity11 said that she felt empowered after telling someone she had herpes because it humanized the @entity4 in a way that made it less of a stigma			1
' i had seen in the flesh what a simple " i have herpes " could do when said fearlessly , without shame , ' she wrote			2
' because when a real person — a woman you know and respect — casually mentions having herpes , it stops being a punchline and starts being someone 's reality			1
' do n't strain : @entity11 says that people who have herpes should not feel ' dirty or wrong ' and should be aware that the virus is manageable and more common than people would expect according to the @entity80 about 17 per cent of people ages 14 - 19 have genital herpes caused by @entity82			1
that percentage is only of people who choose to get tested and the actual number of people who have the virus is likely much higher			1
even having sex with a condom does not protect someone from the highly contagious virus that only needs skin to skin contact to spread , even if there are no sores present			0
the @entity96 reports that according to an advocacy group called @entity98 did n't become a stigma until after the 1970s			0
' [ @entity98 ] was merely a cold sore in an unusual place until the 1970s , ' the group says on their web site			0
dr. @entity103 , medical director of the @entity106 hiv / @entity104 told the @entity96 that the stigmatization of the virus was fueled by conservatives after the ' free love era			0
' courage : @entity5 has the courage to tell people about her virus because it will humanize the problem for sufferers worldwide ' @entity118 was seen as this marker of being promiscuous or bad or evil , ' he said			1
' but unless you ’re in a mutually monogamous relationship with someone who has never had sex , you ’re at risk			0
' @entity103 said that the sex scare campaign was both emotionally traumatizing and also gave false information about the virus			0
a study in the @entity130 conducted in 2011 found several survey respondents with @entity4 reported feelings like ' less of a person			1
' leone said that safe sex is very important but that herpes is not merely a sexual condition but it primarily a skin condition			2
' the way you remove stigma is by bringing something to light , ' he said			0
' we need a push coming at the federal level to talk about sex in terms of health and move away from the disease model			0
sex should be seen as part of being an adult , a healthy thing you can do and just part of your routine healthcare			0
' @entity11 told the @entity96 that she will continue to blog about the virus and her dealings with it			2
she said that ever since her article on herpes was published she has received several emails from people around the world sharing their own story			2
do n't sit in the dark : @entity11 says that people should communicate openly about herpes since so many people have it			1
