a spike in @entity2 sea temperatures and the rapid movement of warm water eastwards have increased fears that this year 's @entity6 could be one of the strongest yet			1
@entity6 - a warming of sea - surface temperatures in the @entity2 - affects wind patterns and can trigger both floods and drought in different parts of the globe			1
although previous research has suggested extreme @entity6 events could occur later this year , experts claim this recent rise hints they are likely to be more significant than first thought			1
a spike in @entity2 sea temperatures and the rapid movement of warm water eastwards have increased fears this year 's @entity6 could be one of the strongest yet			1
@entity6 , pictured left , is a warming of sea temperatures that can trigger floods and droughts			1
@entity28 , pictured right , is when sea temperatures drop @entity6 refers to a set of conditions when the surface of the sea in an area along the @entity36 in the central and eastern @entity2 becomes hotter than usual			1
the average water temperature in that area is typically between 1 and @entity40 ( approximately 2 and 5 ° f ) warmer than normal during this event			0
this has the effect of adding huge amounts of heat and moisture into the atmosphere , ultimately affecting patterns of air pressure and rainfall across the @entity2 and globally			0
strong @entity6 events occur every 20 years or so , but researchers recently said this could drop to 10 years thanks to global warming			1
at the opposite end of the scale , @entity28 is the climatological counterpart to @entity6			0
@entity28 refers to periods when sea - surface temperatures around the @entity36 are cooler than normal			0
this has a similar affect on air pressure and rainfall because it suppresses how much heat and moisture enters the atmosphere			0
dr @entity67 , a climate expert at @entity69 's @entity68 , said the rises in @entity2 temperature were above those seen in previous @entity6 years			2
‘ i think this event has lots of characteristics with a strong @entity6 , ’ said @entity67			2
‘ a strong @entity6 appears early and we have seen this event over the last couple of months , which is unusual ; the wind that has caused the warming is quite large and there is what we call the pre-conditioned effects , where you must have a lot of heat already in the system to have a big @entity6 event			1
’ he based his conclusions on studying data released by the @entity94 @entity93			0
a majority of weather forecasting models indicate that the phenomenon may develop around the middle of the year , but it was too early to assess its likely strength , the @entity96 @entity95 said on 15 april			0
meteorologists added the prospect of an @entity6 will likely be firmed up ' in the next month or two ' , although forecasting its strength will be hard to do			0
the chance of an it developing in 2014 exceeded 70 per cent according to @entity69 's @entity108			0
the worst @entity6 on record in 1997 to 1998 was blamed for massive flooding along @entity112 's @entity111 , pictured , that killed over 1,500 people			0
@entity69 climate experts claim the recent rises in sea temperature are above those seen in previous @entity6 years and suggest this year 's events will be ' significant ' its weather bureau is expected to issue its next @entity6 outlook report on tuesday , while @entity122 's meteorological agency is expected to updated its forecast in the next couple of weeks			1
the worst @entity6 on record in 1997 and 1998 was blamed for massive flooding along @entity112 's @entity111 , responsible for killing more than 1,500 people			0
the impact of extreme @entity6 events is felt by every continent , and the event in 1997 cost between $ 35billion to $ 45billion in damage globally			1
a strong @entity6 also increases fears that production of many key agricultural commodities in @entity135 and @entity69 will suffer			0
strong @entity6 events occur every 20 years or so , but researchers recently said this could drop to 10 years thanks to global warming			1
here , the village of @entity142 , @entity143 , is seen flooded in january 2003 as a result of @entity6 rains , which drove 16,000 people from their homes the impact of this year 's @entity6 events is expected to be felt by every continent			2
during the 1997 to 1998 events , damages were said to have been in the region of between $ 35billion to $ 45billion			0
beachfront homes in @entity154 , @entity155 , pictured , collapsed after two weeks of high surf under @entity6 weather conditions extreme @entity6 events develop differently from standard @entity159 , which first appear in the @entity2			1
the extreme events occur when sea surface temperatures exceeding 28 ° c develop in the normally cold and dry eastern equatorial @entity2			2
this different location for the origin of the temperature increase causes massive changes in global rainfall patterns			0
the new patterns result in flash floods and torrential rain in some places and devastating droughts and wild fires in others			0
extreme @entity6 events are expected to double in frequency over the next 100 years			1
the impact of extreme @entity6 events is felt by every continent			2
in january , a team of international scientists said extreme weather events fuelled by unusually strong @entity159 are expected to double over the next century			2
climate scientists warned countries could be struck by devastating droughts , wild fires and dramatic foods approximately every ten years			0
the team , made up of experts from the @entity186 ( @entity187 ) , the @entity94 @entity93 and @entity68 , also spotted a link between global warming and extreme @entity6 events			1
‘ we currently experience an unusually strong @entity6 event every 20 years			1
our research shows this will double to one event every 10 years , ’ said @entity190 of @entity187 , who co-authored the study			1
‘ @entity6 events are a multi-dimensional problem and only now are we starting to understand better how they respond to global warming , ’ he added			0
extreme @entity6 events develop differently from standard @entity159 , which first appear in the @entity2			1
the extreme events occur when sea surface temperatures exceeding 28 ° c develop in the normally cold and dry eastern equatorial @entity2			2
scientists in @entity202 recently said they can forecast disruptive @entity6 events a year in advance			0
they hope the forecast will help countries develop better strategies to counter the effects such as wild fires , pictured in the @entity210			0
meteorologists said the prospect of a 2014 @entity6 will be firmed up ' in the next month or two ' this different location for the origin of the temperature increase causes massive changes in global rainfall patterns , which result in floods and torrential rain in some places and devastating droughts and wild fires in others			2
the impacts of extreme @entity6 events that extended to every continent across the globe in 1997 , for example , killed around 23,000 people			2
dr @entity67 continued : ‘ during an extreme @entity6 event countries in the @entity2 , such as @entity69 and @entity231 , experienced devastating droughts and wild fires , while catastrophic floods occurred in the eastern equatorial region of @entity234 and northern @entity143			1
’ in @entity69 , the drought and dry conditions caused by the 1982 and 1983 extreme @entity6 led to the @entity237 in southeast @entity69 , which resulted in 75 deaths			2
the scientists examined 20 climate models to simulate major rainfall reorganisation during extreme @entity6 events			1
this satellite image shows the @entity6 weather phenomena in 1997 , represented by the the white area at the equator , which shows how the warm waters stretch from @entity143 to @entity247			0

experts have spotted a spike in @entity2 sea temperatures
this , coupled with the rapid movement of warm water eastwards , has increased concerns about an *upcoming* @entity6 event
@entity6 affects wind patterns and can trigger both floods and drought
researchers said rises in temperature are above those seen in recent years
this suggests the 2014 @entity6 could be one of the strongest for decades
in january , experts predicted a ' substantial ' rise in extreme @entity6 events
an unusually strong @entity6 event occurs every 20 years , but this new research shows this will double to one event every 10 years
