the long public consultation could be a stumbling block			0
in 2010 , the @entity4 was forced to abandon plans to axe @entity140 after its stars organised a vocal public protest			1
@entity31 star @entity30 said the channel 's closure would be ' really bad for new comedy ' yesterday , @entity146 presenter @entity15 threatened to stage a similar campaign against the proposed @entity148 , saying : ‘ @entity4 makes lots of great , clever , distinct programmes			1
if the rumours of it being cut are true , we might need to retool that @entity140 campaign			0

presenter @entity159 , who also regularly appears on the channel , said : ‘ such a load of balls if the rumours about @entity4 being axed are true			1
brilliant new comedy and live music needs that platform			0
’ mr @entity14 added : ‘ i really hope reports that the @entity4 may kill @entity4 are just rumours			2
their support of new comedy in particular is vital			0
’ despite the protests of @entity4 staff , others have supported the proposal and expressed relief that @entity19 will at least save @entity122			1
the high - brow station , which has an older audience , had been seen as the other main contender for the axe			2
