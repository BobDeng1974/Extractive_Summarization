@entity1 's titular character in @entity2 has been branded ' racist ' and ' creepy ' by members of @entity6 's @entity5 community , as backlash continues to mount against the comedian 's controversial new tv series			1
@entity2 , who featured in @entity1 's previous series @entity11 , is portrayed with brown face make - up , an over-the - top @entity14 accent and contempt for school authority figures - breeding the catch phrase : ' p * * k you , @entity20 ! '			1
but not everyone is a fan of the boisterous @entity5 teenager 's depiction in @entity2 from @entity5 - a co-production between the @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 cable network @entity25 - with a new a social media campaign hitting back at the stereotypes of the @entity32 character			1
however the @entity26 has played down the furore over the character , which it says makes ' an observation about the narrow - minded attitudes ' expressed by some of the show 's characters			1
' this post is to stand up to the stereotypes of how @entity53 are being perceived as within the tv show # @entity55 , ' @entity50 wrote on @entity47			2
on the sign , she notes that she is a proud @entity5 , has never been imprisoned , was never suspended from school and is currently studying at university			2
at the time of publication , the post had been liked by 594 people			0
' amen ! ! absolutely disgusted by this show			0
feel confident in knowing that you are not alone in knowing how inaccurate and inappropriate stereotyping in the media is , ' commented one of @entity70 's friends			0
# @entity71 : @entity72 university student @entity50 is calling for an end to the negative depictions of her community in the name of comedy @entity70 is not alone in calling out the television series , and it 's creator , as racist			2
@entity80 - a former contestant on @entity81 and proud @entity14 herself - has applauded the # @entity83 movement			0
' i have always despised the stereotypes that society put upon us as @entity5 / polynesian people , ' she posted to @entity47			0
similarly , @entity90 radio presenter @entity89 took issue with the show following it 's premiere , saying it was misrepresenting @entity5			2
# @entity95 : @entity96 has joined the campaign to declare @entity2 from @entity5 as racist speaking with the @entity104 last week , professor @entity99 , head of @entity101 's department of sociology and anthropology , labelled the show ' just awful '			1
' a 40 - year - old white man , dressing up as a 14 - year - old @entity5 boy in brown face is just inherently creepy , ' she said			1
' it just seems like a deeply self - indulgent exercise where he just enjoys inhabiting these characters ' ' i do n't think it 's permissible , ' she claimed , ' i think it 's appalling and i do n't think he should be allowed to do it			0
' not happy : @entity6 's @entity53 community are unhappy with @entity1 's ' satirical ' representation of them it appears as if audiences are beginning to tire of @entity1 's negative stereotypical depictions as well			1
only 287,000 @entity6 tuned in to watch @entity2 on wednesday night , down from 414,000 last week and a far cry from the 1.6 million viewers @entity11 had for it 's series premiere			0
do you think @entity2 from @entity5 is racist ? ' @entity2 from @entity5 plays with stereotypes , but it ’s doing so to make an observation about the narrow - minded attitudes expressed by some of its characters , including @entity2 ’s own , ' @entity137 , @entity138 at @entity139 , said			0
' it ’s also worth noting that while @entity2 himself might be a heightened comic character , virtually every other @entity5 or @entity53 character in the series is presented as a well - rounded , believable person without comic traits '			2
@entity1 has been contacted for comment			0
we can be ... offensive : @entity1 's imitations of @entity152 - @entity6 physics student by day , turned musical theatre nerd by night , @entity154 , and snobby private school girl @entity155 - who both featured on his first comedy we can be heroes - did n't come without controversy flamboyantly cringeworthy : @entity11 's mr @entity160 had plenty of people calling the @entity26 's complaints line with the musical he wrote about a girl who died of a drug overdose , and while @entity2 is @entity1 's first brown face , @entity168 had @entity1 donning the even more offensive black face in 2011 's @entity171			1
