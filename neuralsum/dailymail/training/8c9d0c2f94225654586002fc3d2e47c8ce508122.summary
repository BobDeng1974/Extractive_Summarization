more than 64,000 pages of sensitive documents about the botched ' @entity3 ' gun trafficking operation have been dumped on @entity4 following a court order that demanded their release			1
the @entity8 handed 64,280 pages of documents to the @entity11 yesterday as it relented in its two - year battle to keep the information secret			1
documents in the ' election eve dump ' relate to the notorious ' @entity16 ( @entity18 ) sting , in which @entity20 field officers attempted to track 2,000 illegally sold weapons across the border in the hope they would lead to arrests within the powerful @entity26 drug cartels			1
in 2012 , attorney general @entity27 ( pictured left ) was found in contempt of @entity4 for failing to turn over the documents			0
president @entity30 had claimed the documents should not be handed over under grounds of ' executive privilege ' while straw buyers were arrested , many weapons remain unaccounted for			1
most notably , two of the guns were found at a crime scene just north of @entity26 where @entity39 border agent @entity3 was gunned down by illegal immigrants in december 2010			0
@entity41 have now claimed the documents release is an admission by the @entity30 government that it had overstepped its legal boundaries , after failing to withhold them under executive privilege grounds			1
@entity48 , the @entity41 chairman of the reform committee , said : ' when @entity27 wants to know why he was the first attorney general held in criminal contempt of @entity4 , he can read the judge â€™s order that compelled the production of 64,280 pages that he and president @entity30 illegitimately and illegally withheld from @entity4			2
' although concerned about redactions within the files , he called it ' a victory for the legislative branch , a victory for transparency , and a victory for efforts to check executive branch power '			0
but @entity67 , a @entity8 spokesman , told the @entity68 the release was part of a compromise it had long been attempting to reach with @entity4			2
he said : ' we have long been willing to provide many of these materials voluntarily in order to resolve this matter outside of court , and believe that producing them now should bring us a big step closer to concluding this litigation once and for all			0
' @entity41 @entity48 ( pictured ) said @entity30 and @entity27 ' illegitimately and illegally withheld ' the documents @entity83 agent @entity3 ( pictured ) was killed during an attack on him and three colleagues in 2010			1
two rifles found at the scene were later revealed to have been tracked as part of @entity3 border agent mr @entity3 was killed when he and three other agents came under attack in a canyon north of the @entity20 border by five gang members			0
two rifles found at the scene of the shooting were later discovered to be tracked by the @entity18			0
they were purchased by a straw buyer for smuggling to a @entity26 drugs cartel - revelations that led to a political furore in @entity101			0
authorities declined to say whether the murder weapon in mr @entity3 's death was linked to a purchase from the operation .			2
