source : @entity213 ' we have no specific reason to think there is anything more to @entity1 's condition , but we find it odd that the company would already rule him out of the @entity222 call , which is likely still a few weeks away , ' @entity189 wrote to clients at the time			1
' this could raise some questions among investors			0
' @entity227 , a head and neck surgery specialist at the @entity229 , said most cases where a doctor might order a patient to rest their voice involved either a vocal cord haemorrhage , or throat surgery of some sort			0
