body parts of @entity3 soldiers killed in @entity4 have been secretly retained by the @entity5 , the @entity0 can reveal			1
at least 60 items of human tissue , which should have been given to families for burial , were stashed away by the @entity10			1
the @entity11 last night admitted that material was retained without families being informed , and that officials are now seeking to contact those affected			1
around six major body parts plus 54 samples of tissue on laboratory slides were discovered recently when a new manager was appointed at the headquarters of the @entity22 of the @entity10			1
concerning : @entity3 soldiers from @entity24 , 2 @entity26 wait for a helicopter before leaving on an operation in @entity29 , @entity30 in 2009 the parts were found at @entity32 , @entity33 , and the slides in @entity22 headquarters at @entity37 barracks at @entity38 on @entity39 in @entity40			2
military sources say the find is evidence of systematic abuse of rules which govern the way body parts are handled when forensic investigations are carried out on the bodies of soldiers			1
@entity11 sources said the parts needed to be kept as part of investigations where the @entity22 need to ‘ match ballistics ’ and for the purposes of ‘ identifying people in the future ’ – which may refer to matching future body part finds			1
but a military whistleblower said : ‘ these have been retained illegally for no good purpose and should have been buried with their owners			1
‘ there is a strict procedure for accounting for body parts needed for forensic testing , and this has clearly been ignored ; it is likely that coroners and pathologists have been misled as well			0
’ the number of families and soldiers affected is smaller than 60 since multiple samples of human tissue have been retained in each case			1
worry : lord @entity79 , the former head of the @entity5 , said the allegations were ' concerning ' but @entity11 officials admit they do not know exactly how many servicemen are involved			2
an @entity5 spokesman said : ‘ there are occasions when it is necessary for the @entity87 to retain slides of forensic material from individuals killed on operations as part of their investigation			0
‘ however , the @entity10 identified a small number of cases where this had been done without the correct processes being followed to inform families			2
‘ investigations are being carried out urgently into this matter			0
the @entity87 has also taken swift action to ensure this can not happen again and are identifying the families affected as quickly as possible			1
’ the body parts were retained during the tenure of sergeant - major @entity106 , who was made an mbe for services to forensic science			2
@entity11 officials said he is now leaving the @entity5 on a medical discharge having suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after attending multiple post-mortem examinations at @entity38			1
but whistleblowers say some responsibility also lies with colonel @entity116 , who was commanding officer of the @entity22 between october 2008 and august 2010			0
insiders say @entity119 was sergeant - major @entity106 ’s direct superior and should have supervised procedures for the proper handling of any body parts needed for forensic testing			0
the @entity11 would not say whether any disciplinary action has been taken			1
but lord @entity79 , the former head of the @entity5 , said : ‘ if there are individuals responsible for allowing this type of thing to happen they must certainly be held to account			0
‘ allegations like these are very serious and there must be an investigation			0
everything must be done to see that this type of thing can not be allowed to happen			0
’ major general @entity137 , commander of the @entity138 in the @entity139 , said : ‘ it is the most tragic mistake and it will cause deep distress to families who have lost loved ones in @entity4			2
’ shadow armed forces minister @entity144 said : ‘ this is shocking and offensive			0
people will be aghast that heroic service personnel could be treated in this way			0
‘ we must be given the full details of what has happened			0
if there has been a cover - up the truth must be exposed and we must establish if any law has been broken			0

the number of families and soldiers affected is smaller than 60 since multiple samples of human tissue have been retained in each case
