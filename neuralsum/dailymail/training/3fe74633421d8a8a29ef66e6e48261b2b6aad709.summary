city are currently in the process of talking to @entity8 about a £ 25million - £ 30m deal for @entity12 striker @entity7 and hope to conclude the deal in the coming days			0
it is possible that @entity8 may recoup some of the money by selling striker @entity16 - possibly back to @entity17 - before the end of the january transfer window but it is another deal that is enabling the @entity22 champions to stay within @entity24 restrictions handed down last may after the club failed to meet @entity26 guidelines			1
