the @entity1 squad flew back to @entity2 on thursday the day after suffering a surprise defeat by @entity4 in the @entity6 quarter - final first leg			1
a glum - looking @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 were pictured at the airport ready to board their flight back to @entity13 after their 3 - 1 loss at the @entity16 on wednesday			1
the defeat was the price the five - time @entity21 champions paid for a string of injuries and a tired squad that has not stopped playing , chief executive @entity17 said			1
@entity7 , @entity25 and the rest of the squad get off the bus at the airport before returning to @entity2 a glum - looking @entity9 prepares to board the flight in @entity30 with his depleted squad goalkeeper @entity8 and @entity9 make their way on to the plane as they return to @entity13 after defeat @entity1 , chasing a treble of domestic and @entity21 titles , travelled with only 15 outfield players to @entity30 for their quarter - final first leg leaving injured @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 , among others , behind			1
' i am not prepared to criticise the team , ' @entity17 said in post-midnight banquet			1
' there are 13 or 14 players who are at the moment healthy and have been playing three times a week			0
' @entity1 have been cruising towards the @entity53 title with a 10 - point advantage as the injuries seem to hardly affect them domestically			1
@entity9 can not believe it as he sees his side beaten 3 - 1 by @entity4 in the quarter - final first leg on wednesday @entity8 looks exasperated as the @entity2 champions concede their second goal of the game after 10 minutes ' but there comes a day when you are a little bit tired , when your legs feel heavy and when you lack some of your concentration , ' @entity17 said			1
a lack of concentration certainly contributed to the three goals they conceded , each coming from an individual defensive mistake			0
what had been for much of the season their strongest asset - @entity1 conceded just four goals in their first 17 @entity53 games - was on wednesday their achilles heel			2
@entity76 , @entity25 and @entity77 , all lost possession or control near the box , allowing the @entity30 to score			0
@entity82 @entity81 rounds @entity8 with ease before slotting into an empty net to put @entity4 3 - 1 ahead @entity1 boss @entity9 looks perplexed as his side fall two goals behind during the early stages of the @entity6 clash ' we imagined it differently , ' said keeper @entity8 , who was lucky not to be sent off after bringing down @entity81 for a third - minute penalty			1
' we were not confident and did not create scoring chances			0
the other problem was the mistakes we made			0
you are punished in the @entity6 for those			2
we know we messed up together but we have to keep going			0
' while @entity1 are not used to losing , they have every chance to overturn the first leg deficit , with @entity42 and possibly @entity43 fit for the return leg in @entity101 on tuesday			2
' i am not fully dissatisfied with the team , ' coach @entity9 said			2
' we tried everything but it is not easy against such a physical team			0
' it is a complicated result but we will take a shot at it in the return leg and we will not give up that easily			0
