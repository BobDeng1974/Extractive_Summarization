@entity0 in : foreign correspondent @entity1 in @entity2 in 2012 as the @entity4 ’s veteran world affairs editor , he has witnessed some of the bloodiest conflicts of recent decades			1
but when the cameras have stopped rolling , it seems @entity1 is not afraid of dishing out some violence himself			1
the foreign correspondent claims he once ‘ waded in ’ during the @entity2 protests in @entity13 and ‘ whacked ’ a mob of angry students to stop them killing @entity17 soldiers			1
and while reporting on the invasion of @entity19 in 2003 , he said he attacked a @entity21 marine with his walking stick to prevent him from shooting an innocent civilian			1
@entity24 , 68 , said he is ‘ not terribly proud ’ of his exploits , but insisted journalists have a duty to ‘ step in ’ to prevent terrible crimes			1
he said one such event happened while he was reporting from @entity2 in 1989			1
he saw protesters dragging soldiers from an armoured personnel carrier and beating them savagely			1
he told the @entity34 : ‘ the crowd was a very rough lot , not nice students , and they wanted blood			1
they smashed the head of one of the soldiers in , and then they started to smash another one in and i thought , ‘ i ca n’t stand by and just let this happen , ’ and so i waded in			1
i used to be a rugby player and a boxer and i ’m quite big and so on … and so i whacked them to one side			1
’ in 2001 , @entity24 dressed himself as a woman in a burka to smuggle himself into @entity53 - controlled @entity52 before the @entity21 invasion , and was mocked for claiming the @entity4 had ‘ liberated ’ @entity55 as he walked into the city ahead of conquering troops			1
he later admitted getting ‘ a bit carried away ’ and said he regretted his choice of words			1
near misses : @entity1 reporting on a ' friendly fire ' incident in @entity19 when @entity21 forces jet bombed a convoy in 2003 , the reporter was injured in @entity19 when a @entity21 warplane bombed a convoy of @entity21 and @entity71 forces			2
his interpreter was killed in the friendly - fire attack and he was left with a damaged ear and shrapnel in his leg			2
@entity24 said he intervened again while entering the @entity78 city of @entity79 – @entity81 ’s hometown – with @entity21 forces			2
he said : ‘ i had this injury so i had a walking stick			2
there was a house with a flat roof , just on the other side of the road , and some poor old boy was hanging up a carpet to dry and one of the @entity21 marines i was with swung his rifle round and shouted out ‘ sniper ! sniper ! ’ and i whacked him in the back with my stick			2
‘ i did enjoy the whacking , yes			2
they were nervous and were given the impression by their officers that if they did kill somebody and it was done in self - defence , so be it			0
and that was really why my team and i got bombed and they killed 18 people , including my translators – and how i got my shrapnel			0
’ he added : ‘ i do n’t go interfering in things by and large			0
but i do think if you see somebody doing something really , really awful and you could stop it , you ’ve got a duty to step in			0
i do n’t think you can say , “ i ’m a journalist , ” and do nothing			0
’ @entity24 is married to his former producer @entity123 , who , at 49 , is 19 years younger than @entity124 have a seven - year - old son , @entity125			0
despite his rugged exterior , @entity24 said he cries easily			0
he said : ‘ it does tend to happen to you in old age , it ’s a condition called … emotional lability			0
i read about it somewhere			0
@entity132 had it – he used to get it if people talked about honour or glory or generosity			0
‘ i had it , of course , when my son was born but it is n’t always about wonderful or , indeed , terrible moments			0
what sets me off is generosity , too , and people ’s kindness			0
’ the reporter added he wishes he could be more like 65 - year - old channel 4 news presenter @entity149 , saying : ‘ he ’s so thin and cool and iconic			0
