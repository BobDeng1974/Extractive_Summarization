@entity1 coach @entity0 believes @entity2 should not be treated any differently from his peers but has urged the @entity5 striker to prove himself following his recall to the national side			1
the 24 - year - old has had a miserable start to his @entity11 career with just two goals , neither of which have been in the @entity15 , and criticism is growing over his contribution			1

we do n't need to differentiate @entity2 from the others , he 's just one of the 23 players			2
' @entity2 has significant experience with the national team , he has played at a @entity33 and a european championship , but that 's not enough			2
@entity62 striker @entity49 ( right ) has a quiet word with the @entity5 striker ' he needs to catch my eye and i have to see if he can adapt to our type of football			0
' if he can , he can play in the starting line - up , but he can also be on the bench or in the stands			0
