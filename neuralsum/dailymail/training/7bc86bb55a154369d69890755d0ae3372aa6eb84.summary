by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 will forever be remembered as the village team from the @entity4 who won the first @entity6			1
it was also the home of @entity9 ’s first female serial killer , @entity8			1
when you drive in and out of the former @entity12 colliery you are reminded of the @entity6 victories of 1909 and 1911			1
history : the sir @entity15 , the first ' @entity6 ' on display at @entity2 there are no such plaques commemorating the 19th century poisoning spree of @entity21 , who claimed 21 victims and was hanged in 1873			1
on saturday , @entity24 ’s current crop of footballers – none of whom are coalminers , unlike the men who were two - time world champions – have the chance to write a new chapter in the village ’s history when they venture to @entity36 for the @entity38 final against @entity39 of @entity40			1
the history books could certainly do with a modern - day instalment			1
for it is the sir @entity15 triumphs of over one century ago which remain the subject of bar - room banter at the @entity47			1
indeed , an exact replica of the cup is housed there , the original having been stolen in 1994 and never recovered			1
‘ the village is football , that ’s what it ’s all about and what it lives for , ’ current @entity2 boss @entity52 told @entity53			2
there are five famous former residents ; four were footballers and the other , infamously of course , was @entity21			2
prize : @entity2 will be hoping to pick up their first piece of major silverware since the 1911 triumph up for the cup : manager @entity52 ( second left ) is determined to bring glory back to @entity2 one of those footballers , @entity73 , was born in the village in 1909 , the same year @entity2 returned from @entity68 with their first ‘ @entity71 ’ crown ( it was referred to as such because this was the first time clubs from different countries had competed against each other in a tournament )			1
@entity73 , incidentally , went on to play for his local side before making his name at @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			2
by the time he was two years old , @entity2 were heading back to @entity86 to defend their title			2
there they beat @entity91 of @entity92 2 - 0 in the semi-final before humbling @entity68 giants @entity94 6 - 1 in the final			1
it was n’t until they returned that the village folk were regaled with tales of their triumph			2
one hundred years on , the club were invited back to @entity86 where they faced a @entity94 under - 20 side , who served their belated revenge courtesy of a 7 - 1 victory			1
opposition : captain @entity109 ( left ) , manager @entity110 ( centre ) and @entity112 ( right ) or @entity39 mystery , though , still surrounds the nature of their original invite to the competition in 1909 , as @entity52 explains : ‘ they still talk about it now			1
one theory is that @entity119 were invited but an admin error meant @entity2 , with the same initials , went instead			2
‘ either way , the association with those @entity6 victories certainly adds a little bit of prestige to the club			1
‘ everyone in the village still talks about it and i ’m reminded of it every day when i drive in and out			2
‘ and that ’s brilliant , it should be celebrated , but we want to write our own bit of history now			2
’ @entity2 were beaten @entity38 finalists two years ago when @entity139 rivals @entity140 returned to the region victorious			1
and @entity52 – in charge since 2009 - reflected : ‘ @entity36 is an unbelievable stadium and a fantastic occasion and an incredible achievement just to get there			0
‘ but when you lose – as we did two years ago – everything is amplified			0
it ’s never nice to lose any football match , but do it at @entity36 means the heartache is ten times as bad			0
’ the 45 - year - old went on : ‘ i think the last time we went there we treated it a bit like a theme park			0
‘ i ’m trying now to get the lads focused on the game , it ’s a 90 - minute match and that is their priority – not the stadium or anything else which goes with the day , that will come later			0
‘ to be honest , i ’m terrified of losing but all i want the lads to do is turn up – we did n’t two years ago – and give it our best shot			0
’ it is 51 years since @entity2 last lifted the @entity170 and the sir @entity172 win remains their last success outside of regional competition			1
@entity52 knows what victory this weekend would mean			0
determined : the @entity2 leadership ( right ) are determined to succeed at @entity36 this time ‘ there were over 100 people waving us off on friday morning , and everyone else will be coming to the game , ’ he added			0
‘ as i said , @entity2 is a football village , that ’s what it is			0
the lads tell me there was a serial killer as well , but that ’s it			0
‘ so there has been no history made in over 100 years and we ’ve got the chance to change that			0
‘ we ’ve had success since myself and my assistant @entity196 took over , but we have n’t won anything			0
‘ we ’re desperate now to bring back some silverware for the village , i ’m sure the welcome party would be something special			0
’ they ’ve waited more than 100 years to throw such a celebration			0
it is time to forget those @entity6 heroes , if only for one night			0
tickets for the 2014 @entity207 are available on the day at @entity36 , priced £ 15 for adults and £ 5 for under 16s .			0
