by @entity0 hello my lovelies ... it 's been all go for me this week - after returning from a lovely weekend break in @entity5 , i 've been flitting from filming to meeting to photoshoot without a minute to spare ! being a busy bee means i do n't have much time to spend perfecting my make - up in the mornings , so i 've conjured up a fresh - faced seasonal look that is super quick and easy to apply			1
it 's super-flattering on all skin tones and works well for both day and night - it 's definitely been my go - to look this spring ! here 's how to get it			1
i 'm not a fan of a heavy base in spring , especially in the daytime , so the light , gel - like texture of this foundation is ideal			1
rub it into your face using your fingers - this will warm the product up so it glides smoothly over the skin			2
if you 've got any pesky blemishes that need a bit of extra coverage , hide them away with @entity42			0
remember to dab - not to rub or blend - your cover - up onto the area you 're looking to conceal			2
step 2 - @entity46 the essential weapon in my glow - getting arsenal is a liquid highlighter or highlighting pen , like @entity53 's @entity52 or @entity54			1
take the pen down your nose , under your eyes , on your forehead and under your brow bone , as well as a touch above your @entity61 's bow and on your chin			2
essentially , apply the highlight anywhere the light would naturally hit your face for a dewy , luminous complexion			0
blend the product in gently with your fingertips or a beauty blending sponge			2
@entity0 says this look is perfect for girls who do n't have much time in the morning step 3 - @entity75 next , adorn your eyelids with a cream eyeshadow or primer with a hint of shimmer - i used @entity82			1
this look is relatively minimal , so the aim here is to even out any discolouration on the lids and brighten up the eye area			0
adding white eyeliner to the waterline of your eyes is a timeless trick which will make eyes look brighter , wider and more awake			0
@entity0 suggests using white eyeliner to make eyes look more awake apply an ivory shade of kohl pencil ( @entity96 and @entity97 are both great ) gently across your waterline			1
then give your lashes a flirtatious flutter with a light coating of mascara			0
i 've used @entity105 's volumising mascara - another i 'd recommend is @entity106			2
the contrast between the white liner and dark lashes will give your peepers an irresistible doe - eyed effect			0
step 4 - @entity113 although this is very much a minimal make - up look , i could n't forego my beloved bronzer ! warm up your cheeks with a touch of @entity120 's @entity119 in @entity121 - the creamy formulation perfectly complements the rest of the base products used			1
apply with your fingers , blending in circular motions			0
@entity0 says that although this is a fairly natural look she could never go without her trusty bronzer step 5 - @entity130 you could easily just dab a touch of @entity132 onto the lips to complete this look , but i 've chosen to add a more vibrant pop of colour to my pout			1
i applied @entity138 in the peachy pink shade joy to my lips straight from the bullet			0
dab the product into your lips with your fingers for a sexy , slightly worn - in stained effect			0
@entity145 finally , lightly spritz a finishing spray such as @entity147 's fix + all over the face			0
this sets the make - up in place as well as giving the skin a dewy sheen			1
@entity0 suggests these spring beauty staples to achieve her look for a glow to - go , i highly recommend the ultra-refreshing @entity158			1
pop a small bottle into your handbag and spray it on any time you need an instant moisture boost			0
and there you have it - a gorgeously glowy springtime face that could n't be easier to achieve			0
i 'm hoping to accessorise this look with an ice - cold mojito in a beer garden this weekend ... let 's pray for some sun ! until next week , @entity173 xxx			1
