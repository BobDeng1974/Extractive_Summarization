@entity0 told his young @entity2 players in a post-training pep talk on wednesday that they must seize their big chance at the @entity5			1
@entity2 ’s head coach pointedly took @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 aside for individual conversations lasting several minutes at the end of their hour - long session			1
@entity8 was the outstanding player during wednesday 's open training session , but @entity0 wants to make sure the young @entity2 players are fully prepared			1
the head coach said : ‘ they should be pleased they are here , but they should n’t feel over-awed by the occasion because they have done well and deserve their place			0
‘ it was just to tell them they are here on merit			0
i have n’t detected any nerves at all			0
there was a feeling of relief because they realised this year my choice was n’t easy			0
master mind : manager @entity0 talks to the players during the training session putting it into practice : @entity0 gave his players a demonstration during the session in @entity15 ‘ there has been a great feeling of enthusiasm and let ’s get started on this adventure we have all been looking forward to			1

’ @entity0 has thrown a protective cloak around his players after criticism of his selection of @entity97 pair @entity96 and @entity98			1
former @entity97 captain @entity99 was scathing about the pair after @entity0 called them into his 23 - man @entity5 squad			1
@entity99 claimed the pair ‘ have gone backwards ’ at @entity97 and questioned the wisdom of taking them to football ’s biggest tournament			0
putting the work in : @entity36 and @entity109 are put through their paces eyes on the prize : @entity36 arrives at training and keeps focused at all times getting his point across : @entity0 talks tactics with @entity34 fully involved : @entity0 takes a hands - on role in @entity19 training @entity0 added : ‘ i work on the simple basis that everyone has an opinion			1
if you are a tv pundit you are required to give your opinion and i do n’t expect everyone ’s opinions to fall in with mine			0
if you say to me , has it been a great year for @entity97 and have @entity98 and @entity96 been stars then of course they have n’t			2
‘ but as far as i am concerned they are @entity2 players because they have been @entity2 players through my two years and any games in particular that @entity96 has played — he has played more than @entity98 — he has certainly never let me down			1
’ @entity0 also approved of @entity135 ’s decision to speak with @entity136 over his criticism of the @entity140 midfielder ’s development			2
@entity135 tracked @entity136 down through @entity2 assistant coach @entity42 after he claimed the @entity142 winner had failed to develop			2
@entity0 added : ‘ i ’m always pleased and impressed when players handle those moments in the right way			1
safe hands : goalkeeper @entity147 and @entity148 test each other during training in @entity15 when he had a ( @entity152 ) row with @entity153 that was at the other end of the scale			2
but it ’s not going to decide if we have a good @entity5 or not			2
if @entity135 answers criticism well or badly , it ’s what he does on the field that matters			0
’ @entity2 return home at the weekend before they convene at @entity162 on monday to prepare for a farewell friendly against @entity164 at @entity165 next week			1
on wednesday the players wore three distinctive blue sweat patches as @entity0 ’s sports science team monitored their body temperature with a new technique			2

all together now : @entity2 players stand in a huddle ahead of training ready to go : the training pitch is ready for the @entity2 players to get down to business in @entity15 @entity0 added : ‘ up to now the work has been very sports science and fitness orientated			1
they are being analysed in terms of the extra heat we tried to generate and it is part of our process which @entity202 and his team have started			0
’ @entity2 ’s players were also introduced to team psychiatrist @entity205 on tuesday for the first time since he was appointed by the @entity207			1
@entity0 added : ‘ i asked him to present himself to us and he did that in a very entertaining and informative way			0
the players were very attentive			0
sitting behind them watching them listen suggested they were interested			0
‘ he is an entertaining man			0
he just told us all the things he ’s done in life			0
i do n’t know how old he is but to do all the things he ’s done in life he must be about 150			0
’ on wednesday @entity219 defender @entity217 , who is on standby for the squad , missed the session after tweaking his knee			1
