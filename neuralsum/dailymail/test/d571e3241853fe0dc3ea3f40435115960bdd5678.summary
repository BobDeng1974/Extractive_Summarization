a @entity1 man has won the right to see his son , even thought the child was conceived through the woman using a turkey baster , a court has ruled , @entity8 provided his friend @entity9 with sperm and she impregnated herself using the kitchen accessory in 2010			1
she had opted for the bizarre method of conception because she believed that the absence of intercourse would mean mr @entity8 had no parental rights			1
after the boy was born , the pair disagreed on the level of involvement mr @entity8 would have in his son 's life , with ms @entity9 intent on raising him alone			1
unusual method : a court in @entity26 , @entity1 , has ruled that even though @entity9 impregnated herself using a turkey baster and @entity8 's sperm , he still has parental rights mr @entity8 had envisioned being more involved in the child 's life , telling a lower court he had hoped to ' attend the boy 's sporting events some day ' , and have a say in major decisions such as school			1
the @entity39 ruled tuesday that as the child 's biological father , mr @entity8 is more than a sperm donor and is entitled to be a part of his son 's life			1
' the path to fatherhood may have been unconventional , ' the court said , but it does n't remove @entity8 's parental rights			1
according to court filings , ms @entity9 impregnated herself with a turkey baster , believing that mr @entity8 would not have any parental rights because they did not have intercourse			1
mr @entity8 had agreed after some trepidation to provide the sperm , and the pair underwent several tries before ms @entity9 fell pregnant			2
they discussed a written contract but never signed one , a court heard			0
' @entity62 used an ordinary turkey baster to inseminate herself , ' the court said			2
' no other person was involved			0
they did not go to a doctor 's office or to a medical facility			0
' after several visits from mr @entity8 in 2010 , ms @entity9 learned that she was pregnant in july			0
their good relationship continued for the early part of the pregnancy , with mr @entity8 visiting and bringing a stuffed bear and baby clothes			0
however , ms @entity9 wanted him to be only ' as involved as her other friends ' , a lower court was told , while he sought a more active role â€” attendance at the boy 's sporting events someday , and a voice in major decisions			1
ms @entity9 fell pregnant after several ' tries ' using mr @entity8 's sperm , but despite an initially friendly relationship , the pair fell out when she rejected his suggestion for a name for their son the relationship soured when ms @entity9 rejected mr @entity8 's suggested name for the child			2
they did n't speak for about five months , until the boy was born and @entity8 showed up at the hospital			0
later visits to her home were ' sort of strained , ' ms @entity100 said , and she eventually told @entity8 to stay away			0
ms @entity9 argued that @entity8 had no rights because , under the state 's assisted conception law , he was merely a sperm donor			2
but the law defines assisted conception as a pregnancy resulting from ' medical technology , ' and that definition doomed her argument			0
' the plain meaning of the term ' medical technology ' does not encompass a kitchen implement such as a turkey baster , ' judge @entity111 wrote for the appeals court			2
ms @entity9 can still appeal to the @entity118 .			0
