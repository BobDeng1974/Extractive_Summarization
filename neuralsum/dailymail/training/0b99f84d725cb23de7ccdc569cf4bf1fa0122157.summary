taking the contraceptive pill may increase a woman ’s chance of developing multiple sclerosis , researchers warn			0
the risk of @entity6 could be up to 50 per cent higher among women on the @entity8 , according to a new @entity10 study			1
the findings also show young obese women are at greater risk of the disease , probably because they produce higher levels of a hormone known to regulate appetite			0
warning : a @entity10 study of more than 3,300 women found more developed @entity6 if they used the pill previous research had suggested that oral contraception could cut @entity6 risk , or delay its onset			1
@entity6 is the most common disabling neurological condition , affecting almost 100,000 @entity26 – 50 young people are diagnosed each week			0
it involves damage to myelin , a protective sheath surrounding nerve fibres of the central nervous system , meaning the body ’s immune system attacks itself			0
symptoms range from mild , occasional illness involving numbness , muscle weakness and eye problems to rapid and severe deterioration , resulting in serious disability			0
popular : the contraceptive pill is used by millions @entity10 researchers identified 305 women who had been diagnosed with @entity6 during a three - year period			1
their use of the @entity8 – mainly a combination of two hormones – was compared with 3,050 women who did not have ms. in total , 29 per cent of the women with @entity6 and 24 per cent of those without @entity6 had used hormonal contraceptives for at least three months in the three years before symptoms began			1
women who had used the @entity8 were 35 per cent more likely to develop @entity6 than those who did not use them			1
those who had used the contraceptives but had stopped at least one month before symptoms started were 50 per cent more likely to develop ms. lead researcher dr @entity60 said : ‘ these findings suggest that using hormonal contraceptives may be contributing at least in part to the rise in the rate of @entity6 among women			2
’ previously animal research led experts to believe female hormones might delay the onset of @entity6 , and a @entity26 study suggested @entity8 users had a 40 per cent lower risk			1
the new research was presented at the @entity76 ’s annual meeting in @entity77			2
in a separate study at the same meeting , researchers looked at a possible link between obesity and @entity6 , by checking the @entity83 ( @entity83 ) of study volunteers			0
@entity83 was calculated for 210 people with @entity6 and 210 people of the same age and sex who did not have @entity6 at ages 15 and 20 and at the time of the study			0
the study found that people who are obese at age 20 are twice as likely to later develop @entity6 as people who are not obese			1
the study found that people with higher @entity83 levels also had higher levels of leptin , a hormone made by fat tissue that regulates weight , appetite and immune response			0
study author dr @entity106 , of the @entity107 in @entity108 , @entity109 , said : ‘ leptin promotes inflammatory responses in the body , which could potentially explain the link between obesity and @entity6 ’ dr @entity60 said @entity6 was a relatively rare disease , but most likely to strike women between the ages of 20 and 40 – when they would be taking the pill			2
she said : ‘ we do n’t say it causes @entity6 , but adjusting for other factors more women use the pill who develop @entity6 ' ‘ there may be some environmental factor that we have not been able to allow for , we are not telling women to stop using the pill , ’ she added .			2

study examined 305 @entity10 women diagnosed with @entity6 and 3,050 without it
