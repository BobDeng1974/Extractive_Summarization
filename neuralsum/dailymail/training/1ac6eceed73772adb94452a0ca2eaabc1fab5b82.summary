but a self - styled @entity9 may have achieved the impossible task of getting children to eat their greens over @entity4 – by covering them in chocolate			1
chocolate shop owner and professional magician , @entity17 , now has queues of curious customers lining up outside his shop to sample the new delicacy @entity21 he has created using a top secret recipe			1
chocolatier @entity17 says making the truffles is a long and drawn out process and it takes hours to make just one batch the 51 - year - old , who runs @entity32 ’s chocolates at @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35 , came up with the idea following the success of his chocolate sprouts , which he introduced two years ago			1
the chocolatier , who gives talks in schools and turns classrooms into chocolate factories , said he started experimenting with the festive vegetables six years ago at a family party			1
he said : ' it all started five or six years ago when we had a chocolate fountain and i was looking for something to cover in chocolate			1
' i went to the salad graveyard that everyone has in their fridge and found the sprouts			2
i used a raw sprout and tried it and to my amazement it tasted really good			2
the eccentric chocolatier added that he is constantly having to tweak his secret recipe as each batch of sprouts can taste different ' everyone started trying them and wanted more , same so i took it one step further and introduced them to the public			1
parents are stunned to see their child eating a raw sprout			0

he said : ' people keep asking for my chocolate sprouts year after year and i wanted to give them something extra special this year			2
tuck in : the texture of the truffle goes really well with the crunch of the sprout , @entity17 claims ' @entity97 are a bit like an after dinner mint or good to be eaten in between courses or even just straight out of the fridge as one of your five - a - day			1
' the texture of the truffle goes really well with the crunch of the sprout but you have to try it to believe it			0
' @entity17 said despite the large amount of sprouts he eats while making the truffles he will never get sick of them			0
he said : ' i love sprouts and i hope by trying my @entity21 this @entity4 more people will learn to love them			0
' unfortunately , although i have made them taste a lot better , i have n’t come up with a recipe which stops them giving you wind			0
' @entity17 , who is working on his latest creation – @entity122 added : ' people say i am like a real life @entity9 coming up with weird and wacky ideas like this but i just like adding a bit of magic back into confectionary			0
