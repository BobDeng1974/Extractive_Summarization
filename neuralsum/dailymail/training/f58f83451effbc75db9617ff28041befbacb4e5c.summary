mr @entity0 heard the case in the @entity2 in @entity3 , and ruled that the mentally - ill man should undergo the mastectomy against his will a mentally - ill man in his sixties diagnosed with breast cancer has undergone surgery against his will after a judge ruled he does not have the capacity to make decisions about his treatment			1
mr @entity0 heard the case in the @entity2 in @entity3 , where judges consider issues relating to sick and vulnerable people			1
specialists said they thought that the most appropriate treatment for the tumour was a mastectomy but the man had refused to have an operation			1
the judge said it was ' quite clear ' that the man did not have the mental capacity to make decisions about treatment , and that surgery could be life - saving			1
he ruled that it was lawful and in the man 's best interests for surgeons to remove the tumour			1
he also gave medics permission to ' covertly ' sedate and physically restrain the man if necessary			1
mr @entity0 was told that staff had planned to mix a sedative in the man 's breakfast to calm him prior to the trip to hospital			1
the judge said while some people might ' recoil ' at such an idea , the ends justified the means			1
doctors , court - appointed lawyers who represented the man and the man 's nearest relative , his sister , all agreed he should undergo surgery			2
the man 's sister told the judge at the hearing : ' something happening against his will is awful but we are talking about his life			2
' mr @entity0 said the man had to be told about what was going to happen to him prior to being anaesthetised			1
the man 's sister said he was ' very scared ' and would go ' berserk ' when he heard the news			2
breast cancer is much rarer in men than women			0
only about 1 in 1,000 men develop breast cancer in their lifetime			0
around 350 - 400 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed in men in the @entity78 every year			0
the condition is most often diagnosed in men aged 60 - 70			0
the cancer develops in the small amount of breast tissue men have behind their nipples			0
the most common symptom is a hard , painless lump in one of the breasts			0
breast cancer in men can also cause nipple problems , such as the nipple turning in on itself ( retraction ) or nipple discharge			0
in most cases , surgery is used to remove the cancer along with a section of the breast			0
this is usually followed by a long - term course of hormone therapy using a medication called tamoxifen			0
@entity106 helps to block the effects of hormones on breast tissue that are known to stimulate the growth of cancerous cells			0
it should help prevent the cancer from returning			0
in some cases , radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be used for the same purpose			0
the outlook for breast cancer is not as good in men as in women			0
this is because there is reduced awareness of the condition and it may take longer to diagnose			0
source : @entity127 mr @entity0 listened to evidence at a public hearing on december 18 , but ruled that nothing could be reported by journalists until surgery had taken place			1
he was told that the man , who had learning disabilities and suffered from autism , might learn of the planned operation if there was prior reporting			1
and he concluded that a reporting embargo was justified and in the man 's best interests			2
lawyers involved in the case say the man underwent surgery earlier this week and is now doing well			1
mr @entity0 ruled that neither the man nor the @entity127 trust which had responsibility for his care and had applied for a ruling could be identified			1
he said the man , who had never married and had no children , was in a care home in southern @entity156			0
' i am quite satisfied on the basis of the written evidence i have heard in this case that it is highly likely that he does have cancer in the area of his breast , ' said mr @entity0			1
' his sister says he is very scared and will not agree to an operation			0
' the judge added it was ' quite clear ' that the man lacked the mental capacity to litigate and make decisions about appropriate treatment			1
' the risks of not having surgery far outweigh the risks of having surgery , ' said mr @entity0			1
' it is overwhelmingly in his best interests to have surgery			0
' he said it was likely the man would need to be restrained and gave permission for doctors to sedate the man ' covertly ' by giving him a sedative in his breakfast			1
' many people may indeed recoil at the proposal that this gentleman should be given covertly a sedative with his breakfast at the care home in which he lives , ' said the judge			2
' but in my view this is a situation in which , to put it bluntly , the ends justify the means			2
' minimal force is necessary to enable the man to be taken to hospital for surgery to take place			2
' but the judge said patients in the man 's position had to be told what was going to happen to them			2
@entity208 , where the ruling was made , is based at the @entity211 , @entity3 ( pictured ) he said : ' my own view is that even in the case of an incapacitated or very incapacitated patient - leaving aside those who lack consciousness - it remains extremely important in any civilised society that they are not subjected to investigative or invasive surgery that as a minimum being informed in sensitive and appropriate language as to what is about to be done to them before it is done			2
' the patient must be told in clear and sensitive terms before he is anaesthetised that he is going to be anaesthetised and that an operation is going to be performed , even at the risk of him going berserk			0
