@entity0 has reportedly flown its fleet of planes to a remote @entity4 airfield in a bid to prevent them being seized over a row about paying back 65 million euros in illegal state funding			1
the struggling airline flew its @entity10 to a ' secret storage location ' in the @entity12 after completing its last flights on friday			2
but an online tracking website has shown the planes are at @entity17 airfield on the outskirts of @entity19			1
@entity0 shut down services after a ruling that it repays state aid amounting to £ 51million the move follows a @entity25 ruling demanding the airline pay back the state aid it received			1
aviation expert @entity28 said : ' the aircraft if allowed to continue operation , possibly landing at commercial airports could be seized by court officers acting on behalf of creditors			0
that is why they have been flown to the @entity12			0
' @entity37 competition commissioner @entity36 said @entity0 had no chance of becoming viable without continued state subsidies , which means money paid out in 2012 and 2013 as part of a restructuring package would have to be recovered			1
the restructuring plan was ' based on unrealistic assumptions ' the @entity25 claimed			1
the airline has reportedly hidden its fleet of @entity10 at an airfield in @entity4 under @entity37 rules a company can only receive state assistance once every 10 years , and the airline had already been bailed out in 2007			1
' the company has ceased being a viable entity ... and can not continue to operate , ' finance minister @entity51 told a news conference			2
he said the state would fully cover the cost of alternative flights for passengers who had already booked with the airline			2
@entity0 is 93 per cent owned by the state and employs 550 people			2
it has a 10 per cent share of flights to the island , down from 30 per cent two years ago			0
workers demonstrated against the ruling outside the @entity66 in @entity67 after the airline suspended its operations @entity17 airfield is owned by the @entity71 and was once the @entity12 's largest @entity73 station			1
in december , the @entity73 was due to hand over operational control of the airfield to private contractors @entity76 in a move towards converting @entity17 into a civilian airfield by 2019			1
situated less than three miles from @entity79 it has a variety of hangar facilities and forms part of the @entity85 , offering an aerospace base for companies and airlines to use			0
@entity89 , which announced dozens of new routes within hours of the collapse of @entity93 's @entity92 in 2012 , said in a statement that it was temporarily cutting prices to the @entity97 island to help stranded passengers			2
the airfield at @entity17 , on the outskirts of @entity19 , is reportedly where the planes are being stored but @entity89 has relatively little spare capacity due to expansion planned for the summer			1
quickly covering the flights would also be complicated by the fact that about a third of @entity0 ' destinations are outside of the @entity37 and its routes are longer than @entity89 's average			0
the demise of the carrier is another blow to @entity67 , which was subjected to harsh bailout conditions in 2013 when it was saved from the brink of bankruptcy by the @entity116 ( @entity116 ) and the @entity37			0
a small number of demonstrators gathered outside @entity0 ' @entity120 offices on friday evening , but the reaction from staff was muted			0
' it 's pretty clear from the decision that the government did n't put a viable restructuring plan in place			0
our union clearly says that was deliberate ; you can turn any company around , ' said @entity133 , head of the carrier 's pilots union			0
both @entity89 and @entity137 's @entity136 , have submitted applications to @entity67 authorities to create subsidiaries on the island .			0

airline ceased operations after @entity25 ruling
@entity147 must now pay back £ 51million in state aid from 2012 and 2013
planes are reportedly hidden at @entity17 airfield outside @entity19
