by @entity0 published : 07:40 est , 29 october 2012 updated : 07:40 est , 29 october 2012 a four - year - old girl has a rare genetic condition that makes her so fragile even a gust of wind can knock her over			1
@entity5 , suffers from a muscle - wasting condition that affects just one in a million babies			1
it means that although she can walk a little , the slightest touch can send her tumbling over			2
on one occasion the four - year - old , from @entity12 , @entity13 , was blown down by a gust of wind while with her mother @entity17 at a supermarket			1
@entity5 was diagnosed with a genetic condition when she was two , which affects just one in a million people mrs @entity5 , 32 , said : ' i could n’t believe it when a gust of wind knocked her over			1
we had arrived at the supermarket and i ’d put her down for just a few seconds to get my bag out the car , when there was this gust of wind			2
' the next thing i knew she fell and hit her head on the floor and was bleeding			2
i was shocked at how easily she went over			0
it left her very scared of wind for a while afterwards			0
' we have to be so careful around her , making sure she does n’t fall over and hurt herself			0
' she can just about walk 10 metres , but if there is a bumpy surface she can collapse			0
' at first she suffered some nasty falls , bumping her head			0
however , over time she has learned to take the brunt of any falls on her knees			0
a lot of people do n’t realise she has a disability as she looks normal so they wo n’t think anything of brushing past her			0
but @entity5 can not keep her balance and they will knock her over			1
' @entity5 was diagnosed with the muscle - wasting condition @entity57 ( @entity59 ) at the age of two			1
the condition , which is linked to @entity62 , affects just one in a million babies			2
it not only leaves her frail , but she has bendiness in the joints of her hands and feet and she suffers from curvature of the spine and has respiratory weakness			0
@entity5 has a rare syndrome which causes muscle weakness			1
here pictured with mother @entity17 , father @entity75 and sisters ( l - r ) @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 @entity5 , pictured as a baby , never crawled and did n't start walking until 18months @entity17 , a psychology student and husband @entity75 , 32 , a learning mentor , realised there was something wrong with their daughter soon after she was born			1
but as so little is known about @entity59 , it took two years for them to get a diagnosis			1
@entity17 , who also has @entity78 , 12 , @entity77 , six , and two - year - old @entity79 , said : ' i knew there was something different about her after having two other children , i could tell			2
her feet could touch her shins and she was super flexible , which we know now is part of the disease ’s symptoms			2
' but there were other clues			0
she struggled to hold her own body weight as she got older			0
we were in and out of the doctors for two years as her weight also fluctuated			2
' she was never able to crawl and when she did eventually start walking at 18 months old , it was more like a waddle and then she ’d fall over			0
' it was only after the family was referred to specialist @entity108 at the @entity109 that @entity5 was diagnosed			1
' she spotted it straight away , ' @entity17 said			0
' when we found out it was ucmd it hit us hard			0
i thought my world was over			0
i started looking it up on the internet but there was n’t a lot of information about at the time			0
out and about : @entity5 can walk about 10metres but will end up completely wheel - chair bound as her condition worsens ' @entity75 worked at a special needs school and knew about two brothers who had the @entity126 ’s version of the illness which only affects boys , so he had an idea of what muscular dystrophy was			1
' @entity59 does n’t affect the heart like @entity126 ’s but @entity5 has all the other symptoms and problems			1
' it will mean in a few years that she will become totally reliant on a wheelchair when her muscles will no longer be able to cope			2
she will also suffer respiratory problems			0
' there is no cure at the moment for @entity5 ’s condition as so little is known about it			1
but there is a clinical trial that will take place which will investigate @entity59			0
' our aim now is to raise as much awareness as we can about the disease , so that the @entity150 can use the money to help other parents and continue ground - breaking research			1
' we have started up our own charity committee on @entity155 called @entity5 ’s campaign - 1 in a million , where funds raised will go towards the @entity150			1
' @entity17 added : ' we ’ve met other @entity59 sufferers , but there are only three that we know of in the @entity161			0
we hope a cure will be found			1
' @entity5 will need continuous support for the rest of her life and we want people out there to know that this condition does exist			1

@entity5 has a muscle - wasting disease , which makes her *vulnerable* to *toppling* over
took two years to get a diagnosis as condition is so rare
parents are now raising money in the hope of one *day* finding a cure
