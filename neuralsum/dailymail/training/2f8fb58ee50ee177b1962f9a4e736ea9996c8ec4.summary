now new @entity17 research may hold the answer - munching on almonds can reduce hunger without increasing weight			2
researchers at @entity24 , in @entity22 , found that eating 1.5oz of dry - roasted , lightly salted almonds every day reduced volunteers ’ hunger , improved their @entity29 levels and ‘ good ’ fat intake , and did not cause them to pile on the pounds			1
1.50z of almonds is equivalent to 43g or around 30 individual nuts			0
the researchers conducted a four - week trial to investigate the effects of eating almonds on weight and appetite			1
the study included 137 adults at increased risk of type 2 diabetes			0
the participants were divided into five groups - a control group that avoided all nuts and seeds , a group that ate 1.5oz of almonds at breakfast and one that ate the nuts at lunch			1
there was also a group that snacked on them in the morning , and one that ate them in the afternoon			0
the volunteers were not given any other rules other than to follow their usual eating patterns and physical activity			0
the results showed that even though they were eating approximately 250 calories a day in the form of the almonds , they did not eat any more calories overall			1
‘ this research suggests that almonds may be a good snack option , especially for those concerned about weight , ’ said dr @entity65 , professor of nutrition science at @entity24 and the study 's lead author			2
‘ in this study , participants compensated for the additional calories provided by the almonds so daily energy intake did not rise			2

’ almonds have also previously been shown to increase the feeling of fullness in both normal weight , and overweight people			0
snacking has become something of a national pastime with an estimated 97 per cent of people munching their way through at least one snack a day this is thought to be due to almonds ' monounsaturated fat , protein , and fibre content			1
