but mr @entity0 also revealed that mps representing @entity2 constituencies could be barred from voting on parts of the @entity12 after the election – once the @entity18 government had been handed sweeping new powers over tax and spending			1
chancellor @entity0 said he had already cut taxes on @entity7 oil to protect jobs in the industry , amid rapidly falling prices the chancellor , appearing before mps on the @entity24 , said the government ’s support for the @entity7 oil industry was only possible because @entity2 had rejected independence in last year ’s referendum			1
he said the problems suffered by the industry ‘ reminds everyone of the risk of independence ’			0
the @entity36 has revealed that an independent @entity2 could have been up to £ 7billion worse off as a result of falling oil revenue			0
mr @entity0 lambasted predictions made by the @entity40 during the referendum campaign about the finances @entity7 oil would generate for the nation as ‘ wildly optimistic ’			1
he told the commons treasury select committee : ‘ i took decisions in the @entity46 to reduce taxes on @entity7 oil , anticipating the pressures that the falling oil price would have on the industry and i 'm sure we are going to have to take further steps at the @entity12			2
‘ but we can only do that because we are @entity55 and we pool our risks			0
’ the @entity36 has revealed that an independent @entity2 could have been up to £ 7billion worse off as a result of falling oil revenue the energy industry is suffering a wave of job losses as oil prices continue to plummet amid increasing @entity64 production and falling demand in economically struggling countries			0
mr @entity0 said that while @entity55 economic forecasts were made by the independent @entity69 , @entity2 's predictions were made by its government			2
he added : ‘ from memory , the @entity2 government forecast that they would receive £ 20 billion of revenues in the coming three years from oil if oil taxes were devolved			0
‘ i think it is going to be probably around one third of that , well , that was the most recent forecast published and , of course , the oil price has fallen further since			0
mr @entity0 said the problems suffered by the industry ‘ reminds everyone of the risk of independence ’ promoted by @entity40 first minister @entity86 ( above ) ‘ so , they do n't have a particularly great track record and , of course , if @entity2 had become independent , if the people of @entity2 had voted for independence , the promises that the @entity40 had made to the people of @entity2 , they would not have been able to deliver on because they have got their wildly optimistic , and that 's a polite way of putting it , forecasts about oil tax			1
‘ so , one of the great benefits of the @entity55 is that we can help each other when things like the oil prices change dramatically			0
’ the chancellor also confirmed that draft legislation on the devolution of extra powers to @entity110 will be published on thursday			0

once powers to set income tax have been devolved , @entity2 would have to ‘ live with the consequences ’ of its decisions - including if wealthy individuals flee across the border to escape ‘ punitive ’ rates , mr @entity0 told the @entity24			2
mr @entity0 said proposals for ‘ @entity138 votes for @entity138 laws ’ would be published before the general election , but he insisted that it must be the case that @entity2 mps should have their ability to vote on aspects of future budgets curbed if powers have been devolved			1
the cross-party @entity147 on devolution said the @entity2 mps should continue to vote on the @entity55 's @entity12 , including income tax			0
many aspects of the system would remain @entity55 - wide , mr @entity0 said , including the definition of income and the system of reliefs , so mps from @entity2 constituencies would be able to vote on those .			2
