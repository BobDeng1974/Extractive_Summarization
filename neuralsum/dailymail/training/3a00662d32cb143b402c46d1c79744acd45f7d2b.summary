the @entity1 space tourism program was plagued with fuel issues for years ahead of the fatal mid-air explosion today that came after the company 's space - craft trialed a new propulsion system			1
one pilot died yesterday when a @entity9 craft exploded at 45,000ft not long after igniting its engines , which were using a new rocket fuel for the first time			1
the disaster over @entity15 's @entity14 also left another pilot , who managed to parachute out of the space plane , in hospital with serious injuries			1
explosion : the @entity9 exploded at 45,000ft today over the @entity21 , @entity15 moments before : the spacecraft had just fired its engines after detaching from the @entity24 launching craft space plane : there had been complications developing the proper fuel system for @entity9 - and experts say engine troubles are probably behind the explosion investigators have yet to decide what caused the accident , but experts have said engine problems are the most likely cause in the wake of the disaster reports emerged telling how a test engine blew up in 2007 , killing three people			1
it has also emerged that one of @entity1 's star pilots , who left the company for a competitor , had characterized the solid rocket fuel used until recent as being unstable during tests			1
the @entity9 vessel , which is carried to 45,000ft by a separate airplane before turning its own engines on , is propelled by a mixture of two fuels , a liquid and a solid			1
before each flight it is loaded up with a tank of pressurized nitrous oxide and a separate , solid fuel , which are mixed when the engine ignites			1
until the latest flight , @entity9 had used hydroxyl - terminated polybutadiene ( @entity63 ) - a type of rubber - as the solid component			2
2007 disaster : a test of liquid nitrous oxie fuel in the @entity14 in 2007 killed three people working on the @entity1 engines			1
picture is the aftermath but for the most recent launch they swapped to a polyamide grain fuel - a type of plastic - which had been tested on the ground but not on board @entity9 before			2
the first disaster in the fuel history of @entity1 came in 2007 , when an early version of the nitrous oxide liquid fuel tank exploded , killing three workers			1
the blast , at an outdoor test facility belonging to partner company @entity87 , killed employees @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 , who were watching the test from behind a chain link fence			0
concerns : pilot @entity95 , who used to be part of @entity1 , spoke of ' instabilities ' in solid fuels it was a ' cold flow ' experiment , which means the fuel was not ignited			1
the incident prompted a thorough redesign of the tank , and also led to a $ 28,000 fine for @entity87			0
the cause has never been determined			0
however , years later it was the solid part of the fuel mix which was a cause for concern from those close to the project			2
@entity95 , who piloted @entity111 - an earlier model of the plane - had mentioned ' instabilities ' in the solid fuel - at that time @entity63			2
in an interview with popularmechanics.com , he said of the solid fuel source : ' it was full of instabilities initially			0
we had startup instabilities and we had end - of - burn instabilities in their efforts to fix the problem , the engineers ' did everything but break down and pray to @entity128 to show us the light of day			0
' @entity1 ceo @entity130 announced the switch to the plastic fuel earlier this year , saying it performed better than @entity63 and could send the rocket even higher			2
though the investigation into the crash 's causes is expected to take weeks , experts have said engine trouble is the most probable cause			2
speaking to the @entity141 , @entity142 , chair of the @entity143 , said : ' i just can not see that anything else [ but engine failure ] would result in the amount of damage			0
' ' i have been saying now since about 2008 , 2009 , that motor 's a mistake			0
' they should go with a liquid			0
i 've not wavered in that			0
it 's very very sad to see this happen			0
' the @entity158 and @entity157 ( @entity157 ) have both announced investigations into the crash , with which @entity1 has said it will co-operate fully .			0

explosion in @entity14 desert seven years *ago* was testing rocket fuel
nitrous oxide tank blew up - for reasons which have never been determined
previous @entity1 space plane pilots also voice concern about unstable fuels
experts have said that engine troubles are likely to blame for latest disaster
@entity9 plane exploded at 45,000ft *friday* , killing a pilot
