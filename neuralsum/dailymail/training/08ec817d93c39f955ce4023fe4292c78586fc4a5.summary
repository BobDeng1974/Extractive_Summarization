by @entity0 convicted : @entity1 has been sentenced to life behind bars for the gruesome killing of psychologist @entity1 in 2008 a schizophrenic man has been sentenced to life in prison without parole for hacking a psychotherapist to death with a meat cleaver , capping a criminal case confounded for years by questions about the attacker 's mental health			1
during today 's proceeding , @entity1 described a constant battle in his mind and pleaded for mercy as he was sentenced on his first - degree murder conviction , a conclusion that came after repeated mistrials and findings that @entity25 was unfit for court			1
he apologized to the victim 's family and begged for as light a sentence as possible - 40 years to life - while describing 28 years of being tormented by what seemed to him like the voices of @entity33 and @entity34			2
' i 've never hurt a single person intentionally , ' @entity25 said			0
' i did n't want to do this , i swear to @entity33 ... but i thought all these bad things were going to happen			0
' the victim 's siblings described the life she had built for herself as the eldest of seven children of @entity45 immigrants , and the judge talked about his own similar upbringing and his certainty that she was leading a beautiful life in heaven			2
@entity25 , 47 , never disputed killing psychologist @entity1 in february 2008 in her @entity52 office			1
@entity25 had never met her but intended to stick up her office mate - a psychiatrist he had n't seen in 17 years - in hopes of netting tens of thousands of dollars to use to take his sick mother to @entity59			1
his defense argued that the often hospitalized , frequently delusional @entity25 should not be held criminally accountable for the bloodbath			0
but prosecutors said despite his psychiatric condition , @entity25 - whose doctors had found him to be obsessed with religion - behaved deliberately and knew he was doing wrong			0
verdict : schizophrenic @entity1 ( seated ) was found guilty of murder in @entity67 on march 28 @entity69 's family saw @entity25 as a conniving criminal			1
' he is a liar			0
he is a thug , ' one of her brothers , @entity69 , said as he noted a bitter irony			1
' if given a chance , i know our sister would have helped him			0
' ' his illness does n't negate the ability to assess the morality of his actions , ' @entity52 assistant district attorney @entity80 said in a closing argument			1
' but defense lawyer @entity86 told jurors that ' @entity89 's reality is nothing like any of you have ever experienced in your life			2
' @entity25 was diagnosed with schizophrenia while in college , when he told physicians he felt like his ' brain was falling apart			0
' over the ensuing years , he reported seeing the ' eye of @entity33 ' on a kitchen floor , believing his brain was talking to him as @entity34 and thinking he was the @entity103 , medical records show			0
by early 2008 , he had become panicked about how a nursing home was caring for his mother , and he was fixated on getting her out			1
he came up with the robbery plot targeting @entity69 's officemate , dr. @entity108 , who had been the first doctor to commit @entity25 to a hospital			1
heartbreaking : @entity1 had never met therapist @entity1 before he murdered her in 2008 tragic : therapist @entity1 was brutally murdered in her @entity113 office in february 2008 @entity25 told authorities he figured he would get @entity108 's atm card and withdraw $ 40,000 or more			1
he later told doctors he believed he had @entity33 's blessing for his plan			2
it took a turn when he walked into the office and encountered @entity69 , a psychologist who specialized in helping people with relationships			1
he slashed her 15 times with a meat cleaver , fractured her skull with a mallet and seriously wounded @entity108 when he tried to intervene			1
@entity25 told authorities he had n't intended to hurt anyone but thought @entity69 was going to kill him , though he also has told doctors he thought she was malevolently associated with @entity108			1
prosecutors noted that @entity25 bought weapons for the robbery , called ahead to find out the office 's hours and successfully avoided authorities for a few days before police identified him through fingerprints			2
' justice has been served ' : victim @entity1 's brothers @entity144 ( left ) and @entity69 ( right ) , and an unidentified sister , smile as they leave the courtroom on march 28 when @entity1 was convicted of killing their sister ' celebrating her life and many accomplishments ' : @entity1 's loved ones gathered in february to mark the six - year anniversary of her brutal murder ' @entity156 and @entity108 devoted their careers to helping people who have mental illnesses , making this cold - blooded attack all the more tragic , ' manhattan district attorney @entity161 said in a statement after the sentence was handed down			1
insanity defenses , like @entity25 's , are offered in less than one percent of felony cases nationwide , and only about 20 percent of those are successful , researchers have found			2
@entity25 was initially found mentally unfit to stand trial			0
then he was declared competent , but his behavior deteriorated during jury selection in 2010 and he was found incompetent again for a time			0
a trial last year ended in a hung jury			0
in additional to first - degree murder , @entity25 was convicted in march of second - degree murder , assault and attempted robbery			0
@entity69 said after the sentencing that he hoped prison officials treated @entity25 with compassion			2
manhunt : police arrested @entity1 in 2008 at his @entity184 apartment building ( pictured ) under arrest : @entity1 was arrested at his @entity184 apartment complex in 2008 state supreme court justice @entity187 had noted that prison officials were aware of @entity25 's medical history and would most likely hold him in a prison psychiatric unit , rather than in the general population			1
@entity69 was among about a dozen @entity69 relatives at the sentencing			2
some of her siblings have attended all the roughly 95 days of court since the case began			0
' it 's final , it 's over , and we 're very relieved with that , ' another brother , @entity198 , said afterward			0
@entity25 's brother , @entity203 of @entity204 , @entity205 , watched from the courtroom audience			0
