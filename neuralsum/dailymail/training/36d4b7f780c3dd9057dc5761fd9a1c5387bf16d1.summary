@entity0 is the season to be a @entity3 supporter			2
three points ahead of @entity5 by december 25 , and just about every record is backing you to claim a fourth @entity9 title : @entity3 's @entity10 shoots to score his team 's second goal against @entity13 on monday night @entity10 slides in celebration as @entity3 moved top of the @entity9 by three points on monday night @entity16 celebrates the win as he and @entity10 caused havoc against @entity13 on monday night history is on their side but records are there to be broken , as the cliché goes			1
when @entity3 were top by december 25 in 2004 , they were five points clear			1
their three now is as fine a margin they 've cut			2
those royal blue eyes blinked once against @entity30 , they could do so again			0
but first , the numbers that divide them : @entity3 ’s 42 points to @entity13 ’s 39			2
@entity3 ’s +25 goal difference to their +22			2
the latter acting as @entity37 's cushion , for now			1
then to the obscure categories : chances created , dribbles attempted , distance covered , tackles , passes , and saves , among others			1
these we now have since @entity44 was born 11 years ago			0
they unearth the kind of gems us statistical geeks crave			0
@entity10 , for example , has more assists in 16 @entity9 games for @entity3 than @entity53 has in his entire @entity55 career			1
that ’s 12 assists in 16 to @entity53 ’s 11 in 95			0
the @entity58 is eight shy of the record ( 20 ) , too , first set by his old pal @entity60 between 2002 and 2003			0
54 - @entity10 , @entity3 52 - @entity61 , @entity62 47 - @entity63 , @entity64 44 - @entity65 , @entity55 43 - @entity66 , @entity67 43 - hazard , @entity3 42 - @entity68 , @entity69 41 - @entity70 , @entity71 36 - @entity72 , @entity73 35 - @entity74 , @entity67 @entity75 , @entity3 @entity76 , @entity77 @entity78 , @entity67 99 - @entity79 , @entity71 98 - @entity65 , @entity55 93 - @entity80 , @entity55 85 - @entity81 , @entity69 85 - @entity82 , @entity30 75 - @entity83 , @entity5 72 - @entity84 , @entity85 @entity10 ( left ) has created the most chances and hazard ( right ) has the most dribbles in the @entity9 @entity10 's heat map against @entity13 ( left ) and @entity16 's heat map against @entity13 ( right ) as @entity3 won 2 - 0 @entity91 may not admit it , but he missed a trick in june			1
it is @entity10 who , having gone unwanted by the @entity95 , has created the most chances in the @entity9 since leaving @entity98 ( 54 )			1
' @entity99 , ' so the unfurled banners at @entity101 say , and he is followed by @entity62 's @entity61 ( 52 ) , @entity64 's @entity63 ( 47 ) , then @entity55 's @entity65 ( 44 )			0
@entity67 's @entity66 and @entity3 's @entity16 are among them , too ( 43 )			1
the latter is proving every bit the @entity105 nominee he is			0
hazard has attempted the most dribbles in the @entity9 ( 134 ) , his latest resulting in a kicking from @entity108 ( pictured below )			1
well , that 's one way to stop him			0
@entity65 , again , represents @entity55 ( 98 )			0
it epitomises that unfortunate oh , so @entity55 way			0
there or thereabouts ; always the bridesmaid , never the bride			0
@entity13 's @entity108 committed this crunch tackle on @entity16 on monday night to stop the @entity3 winger 195.5 - @entity118 , @entity119 @entity120 , @entity71 190.7 - @entity121 , @entity13 188.9 - @entity10 , @entity3 186.4 - @entity122 , @entity3 186.3 - @entity123 , @entity30 185.5 - @entity68 , @entity69 184.5 - @entity124 , @entity30 180.3 - @entity70 , @entity71 179.0 - @entity125 , @entity62 speed and distance data courtesy of the @entity128 , @entity129 of the @entity9 to the workhorses			1
it is @entity119 's @entity132 that has covered the most distance in the @entity9 ( 195.5km )			1
his £ 8million club - record fee to @entity69 being paid off in sweat at the @entity136 apparently			0
next up , @entity71 's @entity137 ( 193.6 ) and @entity13 's @entity121 ( 190.7 )			0
@entity10 ( 188.9 ) and @entity122 ( 186.4 ) hog two of the top five distances covered in the @entity9			1
the spine of champions ? it would appear so			0
neither @entity67 or @entity55 , nor either @entity144 club , feature ( right )			0
aside from @entity64 right - back @entity146 ( 73 ) , showing why he is wanted by @entity147 and @entity67 , @entity122 is tied with @entity77 captain @entity148 ( 62 )			2
73 - @entity146 , @entity64 62 - @entity148 , @entity77 62 - @entity122 , @entity3 54 - @entity149 , @entity77 54 - @entity118 , @entity119 52 - @entity150 , @entity151 51 - @entity152 , @entity64 51 - @entity153 , @entity154 49 - @entity124 , @entity30 48 - @entity155 , @entity85 in @entity122 they are the only club of the @entity9 's chasing pack represented			1
a moment that summed up the defensive midfielder came against @entity13			0
@entity161 , angling for a route to the box , was met by a lunging , stretching , perfectly - timed tackle by a 6ft 4in @entity163			0
@entity3 made 37 tackles on a not - so cold and windy monday night at the @entity165 , their most in a @entity9 match this year , and you ’ll be hard pressed to find one better			1
@entity122 gave as good as he got against a physical @entity13 , shown by his tussles with @entity121 ( below ) , and let 's not forget , either , @entity3 lost the one match he was absent in @entity30			1
it was down the @entity172 from @entity173 at @entity174 where @entity122 had a trial in january 2009			2
these days he is an essential cog in the @entity37 machine			2
@entity122 gave as good as he got against a physical @entity13 , shown as he tussles with @entity121 @entity122 and @entity121 get physical during the monday night match between @entity13 and @entity3 at the @entity165 and so to better reading for @entity179			1
in @entity181 the @entity5 manager has an orchestrator , the most successful and prolific passer in the @entity9			1
an unsure start is , slowly but surely , unravelling			0
@entity181 ( 1,285 ) and @entity10 ( 1,205 ) , both @entity98 alumni of sorts but never team - mates , have pulled away from their nearest competitors			1
those being @entity73 ’s @entity189 ( 943 ) and , you guessed it , @entity122 ( 940 )			2
yet narrow it to the final attacking third and , again , it 's a @entity3 thing			2
hazard ( 540 ) and @entity10 ( 535 ) beat @entity181 ( 459 )			1
then , @entity55 ; @entity194 ( 445 ) and @entity65 ( 424 ) , before an honourable mention for @entity69 ’s @entity68 ( 383 )			0
@entity181 is currently the most successful and prolific passer in the @entity9 with 1,285 to his name 1285 - @entity181 , @entity5 1205 - @entity10 , @entity3 943 - @entity189 , @entity73 @entity197 , @entity3 @entity198 , @entity73 @entity199 , @entity71 @entity200 , @entity64 836 - @entity121 , @entity13 828 - @entity74 , @entity67 @entity201 , @entity71 @entity202 , @entity3 @entity203 , @entity3 @entity204 , @entity5 @entity205 , @entity55 @entity206 , @entity55 @entity207 , @entity69 350 - @entity208 , @entity55 @entity209 , @entity5 @entity210 , @entity3 @entity211 , @entity5 hazard has made the most passes in the final third of the pitch in the @entity9 with 540 so far @entity181 ( 1,285 ) and @entity10 ( 1,205 ) both lead the way for successful passes in the @entity9 a strange thing , these statistics			1
for all that @entity3 dominate , it can count for little when you get down to the brass tacks			2
three points are all that separate first from second			0
two goals are all that separate @entity226 ( 12 ) from @entity83 ( 14 )			0
@entity3 can move six points clear with a win over @entity62 in @entity230 's early kick - off , though that luxury may only be afforded until @entity5 face @entity151 later that afternoon			1
still , @entity234 comes and goes , the home straight begins			2
@entity37 and his three wise men have until may when the winner will get the spoils and the loser , nothing			1
@entity37 's men face an in - form @entity62 team on @entity230 but he may be without hazard for the match @entity245 does n't feature in goalkeepers with the most saves , nor does @entity248			1
they are n't called upon as much as @entity250 , @entity251 and @entity154 are			0
@entity3 have conceded the least in the @entity9 ( 13 ) , twinned with @entity64 , and @entity5 are just one behind ( 14 )			1
the chasing pack ( @entity30 , @entity55 , @entity67 ) are represented ( right )			0
@entity259 , looking every bit the heir to @entity256 and @entity258 's throne , has made 50 saves			2
@entity245 ( pictured ) and @entity248 do n't make the list as they are not called upon as much 63 - @entity263 , @entity250 60 - @entity264 , @entity251 56 - @entity265 , @entity154 53 - @entity266 , @entity62 51 - @entity267 , @entity69 50 - @entity259 , @entity147 49 - @entity268 , @entity71 49 - @entity269 , @entity151 48 - @entity258 , @entity85 38 - @entity270 , @entity77 38 - @entity271 , @entity55 38 - @entity272 , @entity67			0

@entity37 's three wise men have been in fine @entity9 form
@entity10 has created the most chances ( 54 ) while @entity16 has attempted the most dribbles ( 134 )
@entity10 ( 188.9km ) and @entity122 ( 186.4km ) are in the top five for the most distances covered by **player*s*
@entity122 has made the *joint* *second-most* tackles by any *player* this year ( 62 )
@entity5 's @entity181 has made the most successful passes ( 1,285 ) in the @entity9 with @entity10 runner up ( 1,205 )
hazard has made most passes in final third ( 540 ) ahead of @entity10 ( 535 )
@entity37 has won the title in each of the seven times he 's been top at @entity234 ; twice at @entity295 , @entity3 and @entity296 , and once at @entity297
seven of the last 10 teams top by december 25 went on to win the @entity9
the three times @entity3 were top by @entity234 , the title followed in may
