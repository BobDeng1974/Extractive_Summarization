usually when a player is deemed surplus to requirements by a manager , he is allowed to leave for a more humble sum than might have been imagined			0
think @entity9 ’s £ 1.5million fee to @entity10 after falling out with @entity11 at @entity12 , the £ 10m price @entity7 paid @entity13 for misfit @entity14 , or the cost to @entity16 of £ 12m for @entity18 ’s @entity17 , who is now worth at least twice as much			1
record buy : @entity20 completed his £ 28m move to @entity22 from @entity18 but @entity24 bucks that trend			1
the @entity18 boss is somehow able to extract huge sums for players he does not even want			2
since he returned to @entity28 , five players he thought unworthy of keeping have been offloaded for quite remarkable figures totalling £ 141m			1
@entity32 started just two @entity34 games for @entity18 following a £ 6.7m move from @entity36 , but was sold in january to @entity37 for a staggering £ 18m			1
@entity10 broke their transfer record to sign @entity39 that same month for £ 37m			1
he had only started 11 league games under @entity24 , one @entity42 tie and two matches in the @entity44			2
unwanted : both @entity20 and @entity45 were deemed surplus to requirements at @entity18 @entity45 moved to @entity48 for £ 8m this summer – a profit of £ 1m from the fee paid to @entity51 – despite being 29 years old and with only 23 starts in all competitions in 18 months			1
in june @entity54 handed over an astonishing £ 50m for @entity55 , a player @entity24 had reservations about from day one and was behind @entity58 and @entity59 in the pecking order for centre - backs			1
it is a world - record fee for a defender			0
and now @entity22 have set a new transfer record fee in capturing @entity20 for £ 28m			2
fresh start : @entity45 moved to @entity67 club @entity66 for £ 8m this summer across the five deals @entity18 made a total profit in the region of £ 60m			1
a phenomenal amount even for @entity18 - because @entity73 rules should begin to bite and the fact these were players no longer desired			2
quite how the club , and @entity24 as its architect , have been able to pull it all off is a question many of the game ’s executives would like to know			2
case by case , each transfer fee has its merits for the buying club for different reasons , and @entity18 have clearly been able to push the right buttons to get the most money possible			0
@entity89 : @entity90 midfielder @entity39 moved to @entity10 in january @entity32 is a young , dynamic attacker who can flourish in the technical @entity91 and become a flag - bearer for @entity37 , where he has scored three goals in 16 games since january			1
for @entity97 the previous season he was marvellous , scoring 10 goals in 33 games			0
a player the stature of @entity39 was needed by @entity10 at a time of deep crisis , with @entity104 clinging on to his job and @entity106 needing to prove his ability in the transfer market			2
@entity24 no longer saw them as rivals so sanctioned a move but still ensured maximum value			0
moving on : @entity32 left @entity18 after making a handful of starts before moving to @entity37 time to go : @entity32 and @entity39 both left @entity18 during january last season besiktas have wanted a pivotal striker for some time and in @entity118 have a player who is guaranteed to get goals in the @entity67 top - flight			1
he still had two years on his deal at @entity28 hence the inflated sum			0
@entity54 , meanwhile , are in thrall to glamour and superstar signings			0
for all @entity55 ’s defensive frailities he is an excellent ball player , passer , and shot - maker , and carries the allure of @entity132 style			0
his gargantuan price still makes the eyes pop , though			0
stepping up : @entity17 has progressed since leaving @entity18 for @entity16 in january 2013 @entity20 is a proven scorer in the @entity34 and fits with @entity135 ’ s designs at @entity22			1
by paying such a price the club have also elevated themselves to a higher plane , a persuasive argument in convincing their best players to continue – such as @entity143 – and bringing better ones in			0
but @entity24 , the @entity145 , will be beaming the most			0
at a stroke he has overhauled his squad and still has cash to spare			0
paris match : @entity55 swapped @entity18 for @entity54 for £ 50m this summer on his way : @entity151 international @entity55 saw his @entity18 career came to an end this summer			1

@entity55 moved to @entity54 for £ 50m while @entity39 *joined* @entity10 for £ 37m in january
@entity45 and @entity20 also left @entity28 this summer
@entity32 left to join @entity37 for £ 18m after making just two league starts for @entity18
@entity24 has managed to *gather* £ *141million* from five unwanted players
