pregnant actress @entity0 has revealed that it was her close friend , and fellow tv star , @entity3 who gave her the courage to speak out about her awful struggle to conceive her first child			1
speaking to @entity8 about the upcoming release of her new music video for fashion label @entity11 , in which she showcases her impressive vocal talents alongside those of @entity16 - nominated composer @entity15 , the 35 - year - old explained that it was only after reading about @entity3 's own struggles with endometriosis in her book @entity21 , that she felt able to open up about her own fertility issues			1
' @entity3 was a big factor in my speaking out , ' she said			0
making moves : @entity0 , 35 , lends her vocals to a breathtaking new music video for fashion label @entity29 's latest campaign expecting : @entity0 announced earlier this month that she is expecting her second child with husband @entity32 , after revealing last year that she had suffered five miscarriages before conceiving her son @entity34 ' as a dear friend who spoke out in her book about endometriosis , she helped give me the courage to ponder what kind of impact i wanted to make on this world			1
and i thought , " hey , you have a big platform to help other women and couples			0
" ' i know it 's not a sexy topic , i know that it 's extremely private and vulnerable , but at the same time i went through years of silent suffering because no one speaks about these things or the symptoms and effects of endometriosis			0
' @entity0 , who earlier this month revealed that she is expecting her second child with husband @entity32 , added that she hopes her decision to speak out about her fertility struggles will help her fans to see past the perceived perfection of her ' @entity64 life '			1
people think i live a picture perfect life , and it started to upset me that i could possibly , in some way be presenting a curated , false idea of what my life is to my fans and to the world , ' she said			0
' because that 's false , it 's a lie			0
in @entity64 we put out this totally unrealistic idea of a glamorous life because that 's a part of the illusion that the public and system wants to see			2
' however , why can we not do both ? be beautiful and inspiring yet be honest and support others on their journeys			0
if one more person can feel supported - then i will sacrifice any level of vanity and privacy for that			2
' i will sacrifice anything to help educate and bring awareness to something so common , yet so oddly taboo			0
because it should n't be			0
it 's not about infertility per se - it 's about the disease of @entity97 and endometriosis and the prevention and care of that			2
' when it comes to setting an example for other mothers - to - be , @entity0 , who is currently starring as restaurant owner @entity105 in hit @entity107 series @entity108 alongside former @entity110 star @entity109 , could not be a better role model			1
while already balancing her tv role with her family life at home with her beloved husband and son , who is now 16 months old , the actress is also busy throwing her heart and soul into her music career - and confessed that she has no plans to slow down any time soon			1
lean on me : expectant mother @entity0 revealed that she was given the courage to speak out about her own struggles with @entity97 after reading about her friend @entity3 's own diagnosis in her book natural talent : @entity0 explained that she has no plans to slow down on the work front , despite her pregnancy , noting that ' working always makes a pregnant woman happy ' ' @entity134 always makes a pregnant woman happy , ' she said			1
' well , at least an insanely creative woman such as myself			0
' thankfully , @entity0 has plenty of creative projects to keep her occupied			2
as well as appearing in the soon - to - be launched video campaign for @entity11 , the little black dress brand founded by @entity141 and @entity142 of @entity143 , @entity0 is also working on her own album with her @entity11 video collaborator @entity15 , which , she teased , will be available soon			1
but music is in no way a new focus for @entity0 , who revealed that she has been ' working on music and writing poetry and songs for friends ' for as long as she can remember			1
she has also worked on her fair share of music videos in the past , both in front of and behind the cameras			2
in 2012 , @entity0 starred in the video for @entity164 's hit single @entity163 , which was directed by her husband @entity165 , with whom she has also co-directed a number of music videos in the past			1
but when it came to pursuing a singing career in her own right , under her own name , @entity0 credits her close friend - and global singing sensation - @entity176 with giving her the inspiration that she needed to ' put her work out there '			1
' @entity176 was really the biggest catalyst for me to put my work out there , she lit a fire under me when she read my writing and her brilliance is unparalleled , ' she said			1
' she is fearless and incredibly brave , always authentic yet capable of reaching people on such a universal scale - it 's very powerful			2
' and while she is finally ready to put her own music out there in the spotlight , @entity0 explained that she still plans to remain a strong support to her friends , whom she describes as being ' the greats in their industry '			1
number one fan : @entity0 describes herself as a ' cheerleader ' for her friends , such as @entity3 ( @entity201 ) and singer @entity176 ( r ) , who she believes are ' greats ' in their industries family ties : @entity0 hopes that her struggles with @entity97 will help her fans to see beyond the perceived perfection of her ' @entity64 life ' and help them to find the strength to overcome their own issues surprise ! the @entity108 star announced her pregnancy with this adorable @entity217 snap of her son @entity34 , who is now 16 months old reaching out : @entity0 posted a heartfelt message to her fans on @entity222 , thanking them for their continued support ' i have an interesting dynamic with my friends because many of them are the greats in their industry , ' she said			1
' i have always been there to support their artistry because music has the capacity to reach people globally and truly change the planet by connecting us through song			2
i find by supporting someone like @entity176 , or any friend who has that reach , is very important because i am deeply passionate about artists that have a voice and use it to change things for the better			2
' i love being a cheerleader behind - the - scenes because in my industry i 'm always front and center			0
' in her new music video for @entity11 , however , the expectant mother happily takes center stage , showcasing her beautifully raw singing voice , as well as a number of seductive dance moves , in the dynamic and visually breathtaking clip			1
' the only nerve - wracking part [ about the video ] is that my vocals are a live track with no auto tune , no bells and whistles , purely my voice which is the same with @entity15 , ' she said of the filming process			1
' he is a visionary artist and carefully selected very rare and beautiful microphones that would naturally lend themselves to our particular style			0
' for me , to sing and write , to have a band with @entity15 is just another form of my expression as an artist			0
what we make musically is very poetic and dramatic which is how i 've always sang - more like an old school jazz singer , not a popstar			0
' i really just love every medium of art. and i want people to love it of course , to move them deeply			0
as a performer my goal is to always make people feel less alone in the world			0
' but i will leave it to my friends to dominate the music industry			0
