a horrific video has emerged claiming to show a nine - year - old child being brutally murdered by members of a @entity4 militia who accused him of being a supporter of the @entity9 terror group			1
the footage was purportedly filmed near the @entity12 city of @entity13 , where a coalition of 30,000 @entity16 soldiers and private @entity4 armies launched a campaign to oust @entity20 militants earlier this week			1
the horrific film has not been independently verified and could easily be just the latest piece of propaganda to be released by the terrorist organisation			0
nevertheless the sheer brutality of the clip calls into question the policy of allowing local armed groups to lead the fightback against @entity20			0
' did you not fire at us ? ' one man towering over the boy shouts , to which the helpless child replies ' by @entity61 i did not fire one single bullet			0
' the armed men plead to be allowed to execute the young boy , who begs for them to spare his life			2
one soldier wearing camouflage trousers bravely steps forward and demands nobody shoot , asking ' what is wrong with you guys ? ' , which leads to an argument among the men			0
the militiaman is ordered not to stand in the way of the terrified child , who crawls on his knees in a vain attempt to escape while pleading his innocence and warning the men that ' @entity61 is watching '			0
seconds later a fighter to the left of the camera fires his automatic weapon several times , with the bullets striking the child in the head and killing him instantly			0
the camera then closes in on the dead child 's face and shows brain and the armed men ( left ) plead to be allowed to execute the young boy , who begs for them to spare his life ( right ) horrific : a fighter to the left of the camera fires his automatic weapon several times , with the bullets striking the child in the head and killing him instantly although the video clearly shows the murder of a young child , reports that the execution was carried out by @entity4 militia battling @entity20 militants near @entity13 could not be independently verified			1
the film has been widely shared by @entity106 social media accounts since it was first uploaded to @entity107 yesterday as it plays into the terrorist sympathisers ' narrative that the @entity111 - back @entity4 militia attempting to oust @entity20 from @entity13 are no better than the jihadis themselves			1
this morning the @entity115 ' top general said @entity111 's direct support for an @entity12 push to dislodge @entity20 from @entity13 could turn out to be ' a positive thing ' if it does not inflame sectarian tensions			1
the statement by general @entity121 , chairman of the @entity122 , reflected the delicate balance @entity124 is trying to strike between limiting @entity111 influence and allowing @entity12 leaders to determine their own path towards defeating @entity20			2
battle : @entity4 fighters fire their weapons during clashes with @entity9 militants near @entity13 yesterday @entity133 are fired from the back of @entity4 vehicles as they engage @entity9 terrorists near @entity13 @entity4 fighters hide behind sandbags while fighting @entity9 militants near @entity13 yesterday afternoon an armed @entity4 fighter takes up his position during clashes with @entity9 militants close to @entity13 @entity115 officials say @entity12 did not ask the @entity115 to provide air support for the @entity13 offensive , even though the @entity115 - led military coalition has been conducting air strikes in much of @entity12 since august and has deployed hundreds of @entity115 soldiers to try to regenerate an @entity12 army that collapsed last june			1
@entity121 said @entity111 and its proxies have been operating inside @entity12 since 2004 , but the @entity13 campaign signals a new level of involvement			0
he said that about two - thirds of the force seeking to retake @entity13 is comprised of @entity111 - based @entity4 militia fighters			2
@entity12 government troops make up the other third			0
@entity13 , the hometown of former @entity12 president @entity158 , is a predominantly @entity159 city			2
retaking the @entity20 stronghold is considered vital if government forces are to succeed in their plan to force @entity20 out of the oil rich city of @entity170 , the terror group 's @entity12 power base which lies just 140 miles north of @entity13 on @entity162 - a road that effectively marks the front line in northern @entity12 .			1
