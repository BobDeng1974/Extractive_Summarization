by @entity0 the @entity1 has admitted programmes aired before the 9pm watershed are not always suitable for children			0
under the corporation ’s guidelines , programmes containing adult material such as nudity , swearing and violence should not be shown before this boundary			2
but the corporation ’s governing body has now confessed , for what appears to be the first time , that not all programming shown an hour before the watershed is suitable for younger children - prompting experts to warn that this could signal the end of the 9pm threshold			0
claim : viewers of the popular soap @entity26 , on at 8pm , ' would not have found the swearing unacceptable ' the unexpected and damning admission was made by the @entity29 following criticism from a viewer about sexually explicit swearing during the long - running and popular soap @entity26 which is aired at 8pm			1
rejecting the complaint that it was inappropriate for such language to be used before the watershed , the trust ’s @entity34 said in a report released yesterday that ‘ regular viewers of this drama serial would not have found the use of the word ‘ s * * * ging ’ or the phrase ‘ cut his b * * * * off ’ unacceptable			1
’ it added : ‘ @entity26 starts an hour before the watershed , when viewers are aware that not all programming is suitable for younger children			1
‘ parents and carers share responsibility with the broadcaster to decide what is suitable for children to view			0
’ the decision was made despite the @entity1 ’s own editorial guidelines stating that programmes shown between 5.30am and 9pm must be suitable for children			2
responding to the decision , @entity62 , of campaign group @entity63 , described the revelation as ‘ shocking ’ and ‘ incredible ’ , while @entity65 , co-chair of charity @entity66 , warned that continual breaches of the watershed in this way would lead to a ‘ public outcry ’			1
report : the unexpected and damning admission was made by the @entity29 following criticism from a viewer about sexually explicit swearing during the long - running and popular soap @entity26 which is aired at 8pm miss @entity62 , 44 , said the @entity29 ’s decision not to uphold the complaint meant parents could no longer trust that their children are safe from explicit material			1
the mother - of - two said : ' ’ i ’m really shocked that they have done this			0
according to their own broadcasting code the 9pm watershed signals the beginning of the transition towards more adult material so by this reckoning , what is it ? ' i ’m really shocked that they have done this			0
according to their own broadcasting code the 9pm watershed signals the beginning of the transition towards more adult material so by this reckoning , what is it ? ' @entity62 , @entity63 ' eight o’clock ? half past seven ? is that the beginning of the transition ? ’ @entity26 , a @entity103 award - winning medical drama , is broadcast weekly on @entity1 at 8pm			1
offence was caused to a viewer during an episode aired in september last year which was watched by 4.66 million people , including about 186,000 children			0
during the programme a registrar says to a nurse : ‘ you ’re just s * * * ging her [ referring to a consultant ]			1
actually forming a functioning relationship with a woman is like picking through a minefield			0
’ later in the episode the consultant advises the registrar to ‘ remind him that you have the power to cut his b * * * * off ’ after a radiologist delays a patient ’s x-ray			1
the complainant , who has not been named , took offence to ‘ such appallingly sexually explicit language ’ and he contacted the @entity1 querying whether the language used in the programme would have been acceptable if it had been used by a schoolteacher			1
he stated : ‘ i contend that parents and carers do not have dual standards and they expect high standards from their schools and their @entity1			0
’ appropriate viewing ? the decision was made despite the @entity1 's own editorial guidelines stating that programmes shown between 5.30am and 9pm must be suitable for children ( file picture ) the @entity29 admitted there was ‘ some sensitivity ’ to the use of the word ‘ s * * g ’ in pre-watershed viewing and referred to previous complaints from viewers			1
it also noted that some viewers may find the use of these particular words ‘ offensive ’ but said the language was fitting given the context of the scene and the ‘ animosity ’ between the two characters on the show			1
however , the @entity29 , which acts as the final arbiter of appeals within the corporation , concluded the programme had not breached guidelines			2
' there are so many tens of thousands of parents who actually consider that the watershed is really helping them protect their children ' @entity65 , @entity66 miss @entity62 argued parents used the watershed as a guide to know what is and is not suitable for their children to watch			2
she said : ‘ i ’ve never seen @entity26 but does that mean i can not expect that my first time of watching it to be suitable for pre-watershed broadcast ? it must be because it ’s broadcast before nine o’clock			2
’ mrs suit , 59 , whose charity is working to protect children from media harm , added : ‘ there are so many tens of thousands of parents who actually consider that the watershed is really helping them protect their children			0
' but if we ’re going to see broadcasters themselves undermining that protection then i think we ’ll have a real outcry			0
’ the complaint is not the first time that questions have been raised over the @entity1 and swearing			0
in 2009 viewers told a tv standards investigation that they were fed up with bad language			0
under the new regime suggested , ironically , by the @entity29 , the most offensive words will almost always be bleeped out or cut for another hour after the 9pm watershed on @entity1 .			2
