@entity1 ’s lawyers have threatened to sue the makers of a controversial new film about the murder of @entity5 , which has won the approval of the dead @entity9 exchange student 's family			1
the @entity14 movie , by @entity9 director @entity10 and starring @entity11 and @entity12 , has won the apparent blessing of the @entity17 family			1
the film is based on the book ‘ @entity25 ’ , written by @entity21 journalist @entity20 , who covered the brutal 2007 murder of @entity17 , in the picturesque hilltop university town of @entity24			1
@entity30 and then - boyfriend @entity31 served four years for the murder , before being released on appeal in 2011 , but were sensationally re-convicted earlier this year			1
the @entity34 , nicknamed @entity1 , remains at large in the @entity34 while appealing to @entity36 ’s @entity35			1
if she loses her final appeal she will become a fugitive , and the subject of a high profile extradition tussle			0
@entity30 ’s lawyer @entity42 pointed out that @entity30 ’s case was still ongoing , and said the @entity34 creative writing graduate would sue if the film ‘ was damaging to her image			1
’ he said he had n't seen it but ' supposed - knowing the author - that it implies that @entity1 is guilty '			0
‘ there have already been at least two films and 12 books about the case			0
if the film is based even loosely on the murder in @entity24 and if it is damaging to @entity1 ’s image , we will be asking for damages , as we have done in other cases			2
' but the writer insists the film does not ' place the knife in @entity30 's hand '			1
@entity30 , pictured in 2009 during her original trial , served four years in prison for miss @entity17 's murder however , in 2011 , she successfully appealed against the conviction and was released from jail but the @entity17 family , who were given a sneak preview of @entity73 , have given their apparent blessing to the film , even allowing it to be dedicated to @entity5 ’s memory			1
director @entity10 , who showed the film privately to @entity5 ’s brother @entity80 , said it was important to him to keep the victim at the centre of the story , rather than @entity30			2
mr @entity10 said : ‘ the @entity17 family had talked a lot about that , with a huge amount of dignity , the reasons they went for the trial was to make sure that amongst the chaos , it was remembered that someone had lost their life			2
that was one of the central things i thought about			0
’ he said he had dedicated the film to @entity5 only with the @entity101 ' permission , telling @entity102 : ‘ i did n’t want to do that unless someone from her family had seen it			2
' ( from left to right ) actress @entity11 , director @entity10 , and actress @entity12 celebrating at the premiere of @entity73 , which is based on the court case @entity30 herself is played by @entity110 graduate @entity109 , 23 , who appeared as @entity111 in @entity112 in 2004 miss @entity20 , played by @entity11 in the film , explained : ' there was a meeting in @entity116 with @entity10 and @entity117 where he showed him the film			1
it was a very private thing			0
but if the @entity101 had objected to the film , the dedication to @entity5 would n’t have been there			0
' she said : ‘ i remember worrying that a movie about this murder would be ultimately sensational , bloody , and disrespectful to @entity5 , who did n’t deserve to be a victim once more			2
’ she told the @entity133 : ‘ anything with @entity30 as the star would be disrespectful to @entity5			0
but the film is not really about the murder , it just uses it as a jumping off point			0
' the writer claimed she was not worried about being sued , as she said the film does not ‘ place the knife in @entity30 ’s hand ’			1
@entity30 herself is played by @entity110 graduate @entity109 , 23 , who appeared as @entity111 , in @entity112 in 2004			0
formerly the love interest of @entity146 ’s arch - nemesis @entity145 , the actress has now blossomed into a striking brunette , who bears an uncanny resemblance to @entity30 .			0

@entity30 's layer @entity42 *believes* that film will ' imply @entity30 is guilty '
but the writer claims the film ' does not place the knife in @entity30 's hand '
but miss @entity17 's family have given the movie their blessing
film , based on a 2007 book about the murder , is dedicated to @entity17
@entity30 served four years for miss @entity17 's murder but was released in 2011
she has been re-convicted but is appealing to the @entity36 @entity35
