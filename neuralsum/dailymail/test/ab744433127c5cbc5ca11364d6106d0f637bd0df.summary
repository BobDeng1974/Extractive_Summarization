the show took aim at the 67 - year - old as she is expected to reveal via video that she is taking another stab at what she believes is ' the highest and hardest glass ceiling '			1
@entity0 skewered the news that @entity2 would be announcing her presidential campaign on social media this week the show portrayed the former secretary of state as aggressive and driven , saying things like ; ' citizens , you will elect me ' former @entity49 secretary of state @entity2 , @entity50 and former us president @entity30 at a 2013 event			1
it is believed she will have a string of celebrity backers for her second @entity28 bid @entity56 has already given her his backing by saying he believes she will be an ' excellent president ' , but the comedians on the @entity60 show latched onto a memo that was made public on saturday , saying her campaign will be humble and about ' everyday @entity49 '			1
after decades in the public eye , and stints in political offices , she faces a challenge showing her more down - to - earth side			0
on her first try at recording the video she screams in a dictatorial manner : ' citizens , you will elect me			2
i will be your leader			0

' after trying to quiet her husband , @entity30 gives in and says ; ' who are we kidding ? buckle up @entity49 , cause the @entity114 are back			2
' she then goes over one more problem she has with her adviser - the fact she can not be her own vice president			1
@entity30 was also featured in the skit , urging @entity49 to elect @entity2 so he could be her vice president			1

' speaking about the release of the emails , following pressure from her opponents and the media , she says : ' go ahead , read them , you wo n't find squat			2
' when she announces she will likely become the overwhelming favorite to win her party 's nomination , with no stiff opponents expected to face her in the primaries			2

' opinion polls show @entity30 has a huge lead over potential 2016 @entity95 rivals , and few are expected to enter the race			2

' it 's time for her			0
' as her official announcement loomed , the @entity298 linked @entity30 to @entity56 , a regular focus of criticism from the @entity196			0
' all @entity2 is offering is a continuation of the same big government ideas that have grown @entity306 instead of the middle class , ' @entity298 spokesman @entity303 said in a statement saturday			1
