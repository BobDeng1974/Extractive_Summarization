by @entity0 the sister of the @entity3 diplomat accused keeping her maid a ‘ virtual slave ’ has hit out against critics ’ claims that her sibling is a ‘ rich elite poster girl of privilege			1
’ in an impassioned defence of her sister @entity12 , 39 , @entity10 has revealed : ‘ she is receiving hate mails from unknown random people accusing her of ‘ using slave labor ’ and being a rich elite poster child of privilege			1
’ she said : ‘ more than the public humiliation she has been through , these accusations which attack the very core of her value system are causing her deep pain and anguish			2
but according to her sister : ‘ the hate mail and the unfair accusations are far more likely to break @entity12 ’s spirit than anything else			1
’ impassioned defence : dr @entity10 's sister @entity31 has refuted claims that her sister is a ' poster child for privelege ' @entity31 broke her silence in a lengthy @entity56 posting in which she rebutted the allegations made by dr @entity10 ’s maid , @entity58			1
she hit back at the presentation of her sister as ‘ a rich elite poster child of privilege , used to having servants at her beck and call , an exploiter and a hypocrite for talking about women ’s rights			2
’ but dr @entity10 ’s background is certainly one of considerable comfort and academic ambition			1
born and brought up in @entity75 , her father , @entity74 is former magistrate and retired @entity79 officer and her uncle , dr @entity73 is @entity3 high commissioner to @entity82			1
she studied medicine and qualified from the @entity85 and @entity85 in @entity75 but abandoned it to enter the @entity86 in 1999			2
she is proficient in @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and her mother tongue , @entity91			0
but it was neither family precedent nor her own undoubted abilities that secured dr @entity10 her place in the @entity86			1
instead it was the fact that she is a @entity95 – or @entity96 – which allowed her entrance to the @entity86 on the @entity3 ’s quota system for ‘ @entity99 ' , according to surprising reports in @entity3			1
a total of 7.5 per cent of all jobs in the @entity86 must go to members of @entity99			0
the system was established with the aim of helping social mobility in an otherwise rigid culture of cast discrimination			0
dr @entity10 's treatment was raised in @entity3 's parliament , the @entity110 on wednesday when @entity112 leader , @entity111 accused central government of ' reacting late ' because of the diplomat 's low caste			1
raised in a culture where inequity is keenly felt and plainly seen , dr @entity10 ’s campaigning on issues of equality is , according to her family , neither posturing nor hypocritical but , instead , profoundly personal			2
allegations of keeping her maid a ' virtual slave ' have struck to the very core of dr @entity10 's value system had she been used to ‘ having servants at her beck and call , ’ her sister claimed : ‘ @entity12 would have taken servants each time she was posted abroad			1
‘ but she did not take a servant when she was unmarried and without children			0
the actual fact is that @entity12 is happiest when she does not have servants around			0
’ today , as a working mother to two daughters , now 3 and 6 , ‘ this is not an option for her			0
’ @entity141 : dr @entity10 's brother , @entity142 , has also posted a spirited defence of his sister an attack on @entity3 sovereignty : dr @entity10 's father , @entity74 , above has described @entity149 's treatment of his daughter as an attack on his nation @entity31 said : ‘ i am concerned with whether she ( @entity12 ) has mistreated , defrauded or exploited another human being in any way			1
the answer to this is a resounding , “ no. ” ’ she claimed that @entity159 was paid ‘ whatever @entity12 had promised her			0
’ she explained : ‘ a sum of @entity163 , 000 was paid into @entity58 ’s husband ’s bank account in @entity3 monthly			2
in addition to this , according to the $ 9/hour contract , @entity12 paid @entity58 several hundred dollars each month in @entity36 , in cash at her request			2
’ according to @entity31 : ‘ @entity58 had two large comfortable rooms to herself in a well - appointed apartment with all modern facilities and a separate entrance			0
’ she ate the same food as the family , she had ‘ complete discretion in managing the house ’ and was ‘ allowed to pace her work as she wished			0
’ in a glowing account of @entity159 ’s working conditions she added : ‘ she was allowed to come and go as she pleased , having the house keys , metro pass and the option to take taxis at @entity12 ’s expense			0
’ she added : ‘ we was provided with a mobile phone , had bought an @entity187 which she often used for @entity56 and could communicate with whomever she wished whenever she wished , in @entity3 or @entity36			2
’ ' the hate mail and accusations are far more likely to break @entity12 's spirit than anything else , ' - @entity10 according to @entity31 , @entity159 was welcomed as a member of the family and forged a close bond with the girls for whom she largely cared			1
in return she left ‘ without any warning or notice , ’ she said , and ‘ without even leaving a good - bye not for the girls who were so fond of her			0
’ she claimed that dr @entity10 offered to pay for @entity159 ’s flight back to @entity3 if she was unhappy with her role and that when ‘ she faced @entity12 across a negotiating table , ’ @entity159 told her : ‘ i will not go back			1
why will i go back ? i know that if i go back i will never be able to come back to the @entity149			2
‘ so who exploited whom ? who used whom ? ’ by her own admission @entity31 did not witness any of the scenes she so keenly described			0
but , she said : ‘ i know most of this from @entity12 and from my father who did visit her in the november 2012 - june 2013 period			2
’ unjustified : strip searches are required of all suspects in the @entity149 but it is seen as outrageous - especially for women - in @entity3 demonstrators in @entity223 , @entity3 burn pictures of president @entity225 as they protest the arrest of @entity29 dr @entity10 ’s brother , @entity142 , posted his own comment describing the ‘ @entity149 behaviour as arrogant and inhuman			1
’ speaking to @entity231 dr @entity10 ’s father , @entity74 , revealed that he planned to travel to @entity36 to be with his daughter			1
describing the sequence of events as ‘ shocking ’ he said : ‘ she ’s a brave girl			0
she has not done anything wrong			0
i myself was a magistrate for seven years			0
she has not done anything that warrants her arrest			0
’ and though @entity31 spoke of her sister ’s sense of personal betrayal , her father insisted : ‘ the whole of @entity3 feels that it is not an attack on @entity12 , it is an attack on @entity3 sovereignty			1
’ @entity246 by @entity247 in @entity248			0
