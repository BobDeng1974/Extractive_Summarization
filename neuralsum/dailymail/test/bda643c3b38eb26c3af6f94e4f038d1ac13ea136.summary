a husband whose wife was brutally stabbed to death by her own son has described his heartache at her death			1
@entity6 , who lives in @entity7 , thought his world was complete when he married his long - term girlfriend @entity9 in 2011 with her teenage son , @entity11 , acting as @entity12			1
however , less than two years later , the @entity14 truck driver would be a widower , after his beloved wife was killed in a frenzied knife attack by now 21 - year - old @entity11 after a row over his cannabis use			1
' if i called her perfect she ’d just come round and belt me round the back of the head , cause she knew damn well she was n't perfect , but to me , that girl , she was just something so special			0
' @entity6 said @entity9 , who was known as @entity20 , already had two children when they met and was a devoted mother when they fell in love in 2002 when her son @entity11 was ten years old			1
' they came first , always , there was no question about it , she loved her kids , she loved them to bits , ' said @entity6			1
' @entity11 was the apple of @entity20 ’s eye , no two ways about it			1
he did n’t have an outgoing personality			0
' @entity6 said @entity11 was very quiet and only interested in his computer games			2
@entity53 was obsessed with the tv show dexter which features a serial killer @entity56 who starred as @entity54 in the tv show ' he did n’t talk a lot , he ’d come in , he ’d do a bit of homework , he ’d watch some tv , play computer games and sometimes we ’d talk , but it would be inconsequential things , just little things , mainly about games			1
' a couple of games he wanted to play , or the games he was looking to play			0
' i think that him being as quiet as he was , made her so much more protective of him			0
' as time went on , the couple grew concerned that the now 13 - year - old @entity11 was spending more time in his bedroom playing computer games and withdrawing not only from his friends , but his family too			1
' @entity20 was a little worried because he seemed to be getting quieter in himself , she talked with me about it and she spoke to some of her friends from work , and they were saying he ’s a teenager , ' said @entity6			1
' he was just an average teenager			0
sometimes he 'd be " yeah , whatever i 'm not interested , i do n't want nothing to do with it " and other times he ’d be " yeah okay , let ’s go to the cinema "			0
' sometimes he ’d be chatty and sometimes he ’d just stay in his room play on the computer			0
' the reason it always sticks into mind so much , was how much more @entity11 was talking in the game room , compared to how he ’d talk actually off line			0
' he was more happy to talk online than off			0
@entity6 said @entity11 became increasingly obsessed with violent games and while he and his wife were watching television , they would hear @entity11 yelling at his games console			1
he said by 2010 , @entity11 was becoming even more withdrawn			0
@entity6 and @entity20 married in 2011 and planned a long life together ' it was still @entity11 but he it was like he was just going through a really a rough patch , emotionally			1
' he was withdrawing more into the world where he does n’t have to physically face people than the world where he ’s got to face people			0
' he said the couple became encouraged when @entity11 got a job in a care home , however when he returned home , he would go straight to his video games			2
' he ’d go out to work , was paying his own way with things and he ’d come back in from work and he ’d bought a load more games , changing his phone regularly , just doing his own thing totally and basically just shut us out , ' said @entity6			2
@entity6 said when @entity20 smiled , the room would light up ' it was like having a total stranger living in the house			1
and if we saw him , or spoke with him , if we bumped into each other in the kitchen or we had to stand outside his door saying " look , we need the bloody plates out , you ’ve got every plate in the house " he 'd be really rebellious			0
' @entity6 said they became concerned about @entity11 and although he hated his mother interfering , she felt she had to try			1
' we took him down the doctors , but he did n’t really want to talk , ' said @entity6			2
@entity6 said in september 2011 he asked @entity20 to marry him , and to help mark feel more included , asked him to be best man			1
' i wanted to prove to him that he was family and at that point said to him " go on , do us a favour " and he was like " oh wow "			2
happier times : @entity20 strikes a pose for the camera ' i said it ’ll be nice my son giving me my wife			1
and he was so up for it			0
' @entity6 said he and @entity20 had a perfect day			1
' it was brilliant - i was n’t actually walking on the floor , i was walking inches above it , ' he said			2
' it was just amazing and seeing @entity11 hug his mum			2
' however , @entity6 said although the wedding day was a happy occasion , @entity11 was getting worse as he started to smoke cannabis which would would push him further into a dark world			1
@entity20 was ' devoted ' to her children , said @entity6 ' @entity11 had got to the point where he ’s bringing it in and the house stunk of it			1
' @entity6 said @entity20 challenged @entity11 about the drugs , but he would shout back			1
unknown to the couple , @entity11 was secretly sending his friends text messages saying how much he hated his mother and began stabbing the punch bag in his bedroom while also becoming obsessed with the tv show @entity54 , which is about a serial killer			1
' he was a fanatic for the programme			0
i mean , @entity54 is a serial killer			0
' what the couple did n't know was that @entity11 began using the internet to search for the weapons @entity54 used to kill his victims			2
on the 16 july 2012 , @entity6 , 51 , was working away from home when he received a frantic text from a family member saying that @entity11 had confessed to his sister that he had killed his mother			1
' i tried @entity20 on the mobile and she did n’t answer , it just ended up ringing off , so i tried her on the land line and it was just the same			2
i kept kept ringing her and ringing her			0
' desperate to know that his wife was safe , he asked his father , @entity194 , to go round to the flat where he found @entity20 lying in a pool of blood while still on the phone to his son			1
@entity201 tv series @entity54 features a fictional police worker , @entity202 , a blood spatter pattern analyst for the @entity204 , who leads a secret life hunting down and killing criminals he believes deserve retribution			2
orphaned at the age of three , @entity54 was and adopted by a @entity210 police officer who recognised he had homicidal tendencies he was then taught to channel his passion for human dissection into killing only heinous criminals			0
' from the amount of blood and that , i could tell she ’d gone , ' said @entity194			2
@entity6 said : ' he ’s saying he ’s so sorry			2
my dad ’s ex ambulance and when he said that , i knew			0
i did n’t want to carry on			0
i just wanted the world to stop			0
why ? she did n’t have a bad word for anybody at any time			0
' inside the flat , police discovered just how frenzied the killing was and it was established that @entity20 had been stabbed 53 times			1
@entity11 was arrested at the care home where he worked and blamed his step father , although the story was quickly discounted by detectives who had taken @entity6 into the police station for questioning			1
@entity6 said : ' that night i just lay there			1
i do n't know if i slept , i do n't know if i did n't			0
' in the morning i walked home and there is this big white tent in front of the garden , with police there			2
i just sank down on my knees			0
i was just praying - praying it was all just a horrible dream , that it was somebody else ’s			2
' @entity6 said he was hoping that @entity11 's trial in january 2014 would provide some answers as to why he killed his mother , although he said he was left bitterly disappointed			1
' they brought him up and he just stood there and looked like he just did n’t give a damn			0
i wanted to see if there was something that was totally different to what i was expecting			0
i did n’t want to see @entity256 wanted to see a demon			0
and all i saw was @entity11 , and he did n't care			0
' @entity53 pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to life with a minimum of 21 years and six months			1
@entity6 says he is now focusing on rebuilding his life by fulfilling his and @entity20 's dreams			1
@entity6 says @entity20 always wanted to visit @entity263 so he has scattered some of her ashes there ' @entity20 had seen a picture of a place in @entity263 , called @entity269 , part of the @entity272 region in @entity273 , ' he added			1
' she always said she wanted to go there and i am like , " we ’re going , you wanted to go we ’re going "			0
' and all those plans			0
they just went up in flames			0
but i went to @entity263 and found the spot that we ’d looked at in that picture and the tree looked just the same			0
