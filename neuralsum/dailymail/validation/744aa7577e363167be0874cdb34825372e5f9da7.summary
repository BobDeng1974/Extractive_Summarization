seven @entity1 states will soon be infiltrated by 1,200 military special ops personnel as part of a controversial domestic military training in which some of the elite soldiers will operate undetected among civilians			1
@entity7 begins in july and will last for eight weeks			1
soldiers will operate in and around towns in @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 where some of them wil drop from planes while carrying weapons loaded with blanks in what military officials have dubbed @entity23			1
but with residents of the entire states of @entity10 and @entity15 dubbed ' hostile ' for the purposes of the exercises , @entity24 has some concerned the drills are too realistic			1
' they 're having @entity59 , @entity41 with the @entity60 trained to basically take over , ' @entity57 ' @entity56 said sunday			1
' @entity10 is listed as a hostile sector , and of course , we are ... we 're here defending the republic			2
' the @entity65 reports that , among the planned exercises , soldiers will attempt to operate undetected among civilian populations			2
residents , in turn , will be asked to report suspicious activity in order to gauge the effectiveness of the soldiers			2
military officials say they 've gotten the go ahead for the operations from local authorities such as mayors and county commissions			0
and sheriff 's deputies told the @entity65 they would ensure residents living near where aircraft were slated to create disturbances and drop soldiers , civilian and military vehicles will barrel through and where blank rounds would be fired			1
@entity90 with the @entity91 , @entity89 told the @entity65 that such exercises are far from anything new			0
' special ops for years have trained off - post for years , where they go out and have folks that are role players out on the economy , ' said the army intelligence veteran			2
' they 'll have a scenario they 'll be following and they 'll interact with these role players as if they 're in another country			0
' however , the @entity106 themselves say @entity24 is different			0

to stay ahead of the environmental challenges faced overseas , @entity24 will take place across seven states , ' the @entity106 wrote in a march 24 release			0
' the diverse terrain in these states replicates areas @entity135 regularly find themselves operating in overseas			0
' the military has also reacted to widespread fear of the operation by calling some ultra-conservative coverage of the ' martial law ' drills alarmist and inaccurate			1
' that notion was proposed by a few individuals who are unfamiliar with how and why @entity106 conducts training exercises , ' @entity106 spokesman @entity60 lt. col. @entity141 told @entity145			0
' this exercise is routine training to maintain a high level of readiness for @entity106 because they must be ready to support potential missions anywhere in the world on a moment 's notice			0
