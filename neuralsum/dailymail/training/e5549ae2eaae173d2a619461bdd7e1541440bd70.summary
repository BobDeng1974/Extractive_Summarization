by @entity0 published : 06:49 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 09:29 est , 15 october 2013 she is the model of the moment , with millions of girls worldwide desperate to emulate her distinct look			0
and now , celebrity make - up artist @entity6 has revealed exactly how to recreate @entity8 's model make - up at home			1
@entity6 was inundated with requests asking her to re-create the look she gave @entity8 at a recent party , so she has shared her step - by - step guide , favourite products and hints and tips exclusively with @entity17			1
get the look : @entity6 says she was inundated with requests for the beauty look she gave @entity8 at a recent party so decided to create a video tutorial ' i 've done @entity8 's make - up lots of times and i love working with her , she 's really polite , super intelligent and a lot of fun , so i really like doing her make - up			1
' but i had so many requests for this one particular look that i did on her for a party recently			0
it 's a nice make - up look , it can work on lots of different skin tones and faces			0
it 's not about looking like @entity8 but more about recreating the look for yourself at home , ' said @entity6			1
in her tutorial , she suggests starting with @entity42 in @entity43			0
' put a really nice thin layer all over using a big fat buffing brush to really buff the product out			0
' use a clean brush , that way you get to spread the foundation without building up more and more of the product , ' she explains			0
she then applies @entity53 to hold the eye make - up in place			0
' @entity8 wore a silver suit to the party so i wanted a little bit in her make - up but without matching too much			2
' so i used this metallic almost greeny , silvery grey @entity62 , which i applied fairly strongly all over @entity8 's eyelid to give a great metallic sheen , ' she said			1
silver fox : @entity6 used lots of silver eyeshadow to match the suit @entity8 wore at the recent @entity73 party she then applied @entity76 @entity75 @entity74 in @entity77 to create more definition along @entity8 's socket line			1
to conceal the @entity81 bags under her eyes , she mixed @entity83 with @entity84 , which she smoothed under @entity8 's eyes			1
to achieve the smoky eye look , @entity6 applied @entity88 liner along @entity8 's lower and upper lashline , which she smudged to soften			1
where it all started : she suggests starting with @entity42 in @entity43 eye candy : then applied @entity76 @entity75 colour tattoo 24hr @entity74 in @entity77 black out : for a smoky eye look , @entity6 applied @entity88 liner along the lashline high brow : to emulate @entity8 's iconic brows , pencil in each individual brow and brush as you go @entity6 then curled her eyelashes and applied plenty of @entity104 before dropping on three medium length individual lashes just at the outer corner , to help give that ' nice winged effect '			1
to give @entity8 her glow , she applied @entity110 , which also she used to contour the face			2
' i buff it under the cheekbone and go right back into the hairline to soften everything off , coming slightly onto the temple as well to give really great definition , ' explains @entity6			2
she then adds @entity88 's @entity119 ! @entity120 , which she says has a really nice golden warmth to it , and finally sets everything with some @entity62 loose powder			0
before and after : @entity6 adds @entity88 's @entity119 ! @entity120 , which she says has a really nice golden warmth to it , to complete the look @entity6 says : ' with @entity8 , it 's all about the brows			2
i used a @entity129 pen to give them more strength and definition			0
' it 's quite time consuming as you 're literally adding hair by hair but it 's the most convinving way of getting a natural full - looking brow ; keep brushing through as you 're building			0
' to achieve @entity8 's nude lip look , she applies @entity141 in nude to give definition and as a final touch , she adds a little bit of highlighter at the inner eyes			1
@entity6 has also worked with @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , , @entity153 and @entity154			0
