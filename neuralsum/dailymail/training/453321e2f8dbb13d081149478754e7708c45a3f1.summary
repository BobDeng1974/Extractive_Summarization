a ' secret ' @entity1 group has emerged which shows trainee police officers blacked up , wearing @entity4 uniforms and posing for pictures surrounded by women in stockings and suspenders			1
in posts on the page , former students at the @entity10 , in @entity11 , have also left sexist and homophobic jokes			2
underneath a picture ' of the class of 1984 ' which shows two trainees with swastikas and a third person blacked up , one group member has written : ' cracking pic for the @entity22 ! '			1
' sure you asked everyone if you wanted them on the internet with a @entity4 flag ? ' the picture is understood to have been taken after a jokey end of course sketch			0
do you know any of the officers involved ? call @entity39 on 0203 6151943 or email @entity40 comments : a user wrote underneath the picture that trainee police officers would not be able to get away with the same things now			1
there is no reason to suspect anyone posting on the page was involved in the 1984 end of course sketch irony : a @entity1 user suggests that the picture , which appears to show a police officer blacking up , would make a good news story			1
there is no reason to suspect anyone posting on the page was involved in the 1984 end of course sketch deputy chief constable @entity62 of @entity63 said : ‘ standards of behaviour have improved significantly in the last 30 years			2
what was acceptable as shown in an end of course sketch in 1984 , would not now be appropriate behaviour by police officers			1
’ despite the offensive comments on the @entity1 page , a spokesman for @entity63 said they are not investigating at all			1
the pictures came to light today after a disgusted retired police officer handed the photos to @entity78 - @entity77 at the current affairs website iacknowledge			0
the @entity1 group ' i survived @entity35 ' was initially set up for new recruits who attended the centre between 1973 and 2006			1
as well as sharing controversial images and jokes , many of the 2,000 members were using it ' almost like a confessional ' to boast about inappropriate behaviour and even occasions where they knowingly broke the law			0
many of the posts on the page are harmless and are filled with people reminiscing about their time at the training centre			1
however , because of the more extreme content the group was made secret last month so no - one can see it unless they are invited to join			1
the administrator wrote on the page : ' it does n't bear thinking about if some of the stories and photos got in the wrong hands			2
the media could have a whale of a time			0
' @entity1 group : a second picture of trainee officers at the @entity115 training centre taken from the @entity1 page			1
there is no suggestion any of these people are involved in wrongdoing pc : a user comments that similar antics would be completely unacceptable at a police training centre now @entity1 group : the page , which has been made secret on @entity1 so the public can not see it			1
the image ( left ) shows a training session at the centre in 2003			2
there is no suggestion of wrongdoing facebook page : the ' i survived @entity35 ' group which has now been shutdown			0
there is no suggestion that any of the people who have posted on this page are involved in any wrongdoing ' confessions ' : former users reminisce about their time at the @entity35			0
there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing - and many of the posts on the group are harmless one posting appears to suggest that part of the training at @entity115 was showing potential officers how to take suspects ' down an alley and sort ' em out '			1
other posts revealed apparent bigoted behaviour among the trainees , with one officer who claims to have been recruited in 1995 responding to a message about popular senior figures by saying his own sergeant : ' certainly was n't the shaved - headed ginger - haired sgt from @entity166 that eventually got the sack for inappropriate gayness ! ! ! ' the former officer went on to say that the page shows the training centre was a ' drink fest and a sh * g fest '			1
she added : ' it 's very much a culture of what happens at @entity115 stays at @entity115 '			2
other people who said they were former trainees claimed they had stolen beer from the training centre 's bar , removed signs from doors and thrown bangers off the roof			1
another officer bragged about driving panda cars to the top of a steep hill , then letting them roll back down without brakes to see how fast they would go			0
the @entity35 closed in 2006 after training officers for the @entity193 and @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity11 , @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity166 and @entity204 police forces , as well as the @entity206 from 1973			1
recruits : a typical passing out parade at the @entity35 in the 1980s			0
none of the officers in this photograph have been linked to any wrongdoing a spokesman for the @entity214 , which was set up in 2012 to set standards in policing , said they had no way of knowing if people who have posted on the facebook page were still serving police officers			2
he added that many of the pictures appear to have been taken decades ago			0
' as the new professional body for policing , we set standards for the service and the behaviour shown does not reflect what we would expect in modern - day policing , ' the spokesman said			0
' we encourage officers and police staff to use social media as an important tool to engage with communities , gather intelligence and help keep people safe			0
' each person working in the service needs to ensure their online presence meets the standards expected of them			0
' a spokesman for @entity63 said they are not investigating the group			2
' we can confirm that no complaints regarding this matter have been received , ' he said			0
' @entity63 is not investigating this matter at present			0
the images appear to be from the late 1970s or 1980s , and there is nothing we can see that constitutes serving officers making inappropriate comments or being involved			0
' do you know any of the officers involved ? call @entity39 on 0203 6151943 or email @entity40			0
