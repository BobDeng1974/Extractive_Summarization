by @entity0 it is the phenomenon that has changed our lives , seeing us pause to snap photos of ourselves at any ' reasonable ' moment – while eating , meeting friends or even lying in bed			0
but now , it seems , the selfie is taking over the places where we stay on holiday			0
for example , the @entity31 in @entity32 is currently promoting its ‘ take a @entity34 ’			1
available between may and august , the deal costs from $ 179 per night ( £ 106 ) , and includes discounts on visits to sites like the @entity40 rum distillery			0
guests are encouraged to reel off a string of selfies at locations such as the island ’s 16th century @entity45 – in the hope that they will ‘ tag in ’ the hotel using its @entity50 handle , or talk about it on other social media sites			1
embrace the craze : the @entity54 in @entity55 has a ' @entity56 ' set aside for guests to snap themselves in return , they can win further nights of accommodation			1
the hotel will select one of the submitted selfies for each of the four months of the promotion , with each winning ‘ photographer ’ earning another three - night stay			1
the hotel has even posted instructions to get guests in the selfie - snapping mood			0
‘ be creative when taking your selfie , ’ it advises			0
‘ tag your post with ‘ @entity31 ’ on @entity77 , @entity78 or @entity50 ( @ laconcharesort )			1
’ it is not alone in embracing this modern trend			1
guests at forward - thinking hotels can win extra nights if they tag their accommodation into their snaps over in @entity87 , the biggest city in the @entity89 state of @entity90 , the @entity86 is holding a ‘ selfie competition ’ during may			2
guests who have already made a booking at this boutique property are being asked to submit selfies for the chance to win another one - night stay at a later date , or dinner for two at the hotel ’s restaurant @entity102			2
the trend has also even crossed to the opposite side of the planet			0
the @entity54 , in the @entity107 district of @entity55 , is so in thrall to the me - and - my - cameraphone concept that it announces : ‘ we ’re the world ’s first @entity78 hotel ! ’ on the front page of its website			1
‘ 1888 is the place to instagram it all , ’ it declares			0
it backs up this boast with its ‘ @entity56 ’ – a portion of the lobby where guests are requested to snap their own smiling faces , and tag them ' @entity125 '			0
pictures posted to @entity78 immediately appear on big screens near the check - in desks			2
here 's looking at you kid : modern travellers seem to photograph themselves as much as the sights fans of @entity78 can even expect special treatment			2
@entity78 users with over 10,000 followers are entitled to a free stay at the hotel any time before the end of the year			1
other users can win a night ’s stay if they take a striking photo and tag in the hotel .			0
