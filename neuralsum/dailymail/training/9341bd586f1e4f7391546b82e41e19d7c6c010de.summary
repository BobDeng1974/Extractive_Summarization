flying low over the @entity3 desert , @entity1 fighter jets flatten targets in the sand while tanks unleash their deadly firepower and paratroopers dot the late afternoon sky			1
these were the scenes a fortnight ago in @entity11 , the @entity13 - led exercise involving 8,000 service personnel that the military insists was only routine			1
in @entity3 , though , the war games now feel like a precursor to the invasion of neighbouring @entity20			1
and not just because live rounds were fired			0
special operations forces from @entity23 , @entity3 and the @entity13 conduct an exercise as part of operation @entity11 at the @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity3 the coastal city of @entity30 was the site of military exercises are said to be designed to promote military relationships and face terrorism concerns were raised further last week with news that the @entity37 and @entity38 are training @entity20 rebels at a secret base in the remote south - west of the country			1
the @entity43 fighters are mainly from @entity44 , where the uprising began in march 2011			0
it is not known how many of the rebels have passed through the @entity13 base , but it is understood 20 to 45 at a time have been attending two - week courses since december – and are being trained with @entity52 - designed 14.5mm anti-tank rifles and 23mm anti-aircraft weapons			2
@entity54 may have ended two weeks ago but 900 combat - ready @entity13 servicemen remain behind , with many now based close to the strategically important northern border			1
disquiet over what may happen next is felt all over this desert kingdom – a key ally of @entity61 and @entity13 and one that has played a pivotal role in the power struggle in the @entity64			2
few @entity3 doubt that the @entity65 is now more determined than ever to meet the rebels ’ demand for heavy arms			1
but while they share the same desire to rid @entity20 of president @entity70 , the majority – motivated by a strong sense of self - preservation – view the unfolding scenario as potentially disastrous			1
and not just because of the fear that the weapons will find their way into the hands of extremist elements among the rebels , including @entity82 - linked @entity81			0
or that @entity70 ’s friends in @entity52 and @entity84 will respond in kind			1
the military training exercises are based close to the strategically important northern border with @entity20 a rocket is fired during the operation			1
@entity3 's prime minister @entity90 insists that @entity13 forces are not preparing for a war in @entity20 t is because they believe the arms will inevitably have to pass through @entity3 to reach @entity20			1
this , they argue , will enrage @entity70 , who may well seek revenge			1
in the wood - panelled bars of @entity101 , the @entity103 quarter of the capital @entity28 , opinion - formers and decision - makers meet daily over tea and shisha to discuss the threat to their country			0
here , whenever @entity111 and @entity112 speak of civil war in @entity20 , which has already cost the lives of more than 100,000 men , women and children , their words are seized upon , scrutinised and debated			1
coverage of the @entity119 in @entity120 was almost as keenly watched in @entity28 as the @entity122 song contest			0
should @entity3 be seen to be too readily helping its @entity125 allies , it is argued , @entity70 might activate @entity20 ‘ sleeper cells ’ in the capital and elsewhere			1
‘ it is estimated that around 4,000 @entity70 loyalists and @entity134 members have infiltrated our towns and cities and are ready and waiting to rise up , ’ said @entity129 , one of @entity3 ’s foremost political commentators			1
their numbers have been swollen by fighters who have entered the country among the waves of @entity20 refugees			2
mr @entity129 added : ‘ the fear is they will try to destabilise our country			0
’ targets are thought to include strategic military facilities			0
@entity54 may have ended two weeks ago but 900 combat - ready @entity13 servicemen remain if @entity3 is seen to be too keen to help its @entity125 allies , it is argued , @entity70 might activate @entity20 ' sleeper cells ' in the capital and elsewhere a senior government official said that the cells ‘ may try to assassinate prominent @entity3 ’			1
in the past , sleeper cells in @entity3 have been activated by @entity134 for attacks on @entity159 through the @entity160			2
even so , @entity3 remains , at least for now , one of the region ’s safest countries , its significance arising partly from its strategic location at the crossroads of the @entity168			1
it is also one of only two @entity172 nations to have made peace with @entity159			0
‘ so far the spotlight has been on northern @entity20 , around @entity175 , where the rebels are strong , ’ said mr @entity129			2
‘ but the significance of what is happening in the south , near our border – which is near @entity178 – can not be overlooked			0
‘ this is the route the @entity65 will use to move arms for the rebels			1
and , ultimately , it is only in the capital of @entity20 that victory for the rebels can be achieved			2
’ for the time being at least @entity3 ’s prime minister @entity90 insists that @entity13 forces are not preparing for a war in @entity20			1
he said they are in the @entity172 kingdom to bolster its defence and prevent the civil war from spreading across its border			0
of the 900 , he added , 200 are training @entity3 to handle a chemical attack			1
the remaining 700 are manning a @entity202 missile - defence system and @entity1 fighter jets			0
‘ if the war continues , it ’s a problem , and if it ends with the collapse of the regime , we also have a problem , ’ said mr @entity90			1
he added that the fall of @entity70 ’s regime would leave a ‘ vacuum , whereby attacks and conflicts would persist ’			1
that scenario appears to be a long way off			0
for now , few believe @entity70 will go anywhere soon , particularly as he appears to be in the ascendancy			2
after successfully recapturing the town of @entity223 near the @entity225 border , regime forces have moved on rebel strongholds around @entity178 and the @entity3 border			1
@entity3 's prime minister @entity90 insists that @entity13 forces are not preparing for a war in @entity20 ‘ the regime is directing its forces to the border region , ’ said @entity230 , who heads a @entity43 battalion outside the southern city of @entity44			1
‘ we can no longer guarantee the safety of refugees trying to enter @entity3			2
’ yesterday , thousands of refugees were stranded across the border because @entity241 forces , fighting alongside mercenaries from @entity134 , the @entity225 @entity244 party , had cut off access routes to @entity3 , which has already taken in more than 550,000 people			2
more than 160,000 of them are in the @entity248 , which has effectively become @entity3 ’s fifth largest city			1
while many are still desperate to reach it , others are already starting to leave			0
already this month some 9,000 @entity20 abandoned @entity248 to answer the rebels ’ call to return to their homeland and ‘ defend ’ their towns			2
many more have simply had enough of the camp , which has become increasingly lawless , and long to start a new life in @entity28 which is off - limits to them			0
bearing the brunt of the @entity20 ’ frustrations have been humanitarian agency workers			2
‘ there have been around 70 cases where agency workers have been attacked with sticks and rocks , ’ said @entity264 , a clinic manager with @entity265			0
‘ last month a policeman was stabbed by a refugee			0
there have been demonstrations , with refugees burning down their tents			0
people are becoming frustrated because they have been here so long			0
’ on the surface , however , the camp appears well - equipped , with schools , sports facilities , shops and even a tailor			0
‘ i do n’t want to go back to fight in @entity20 – i just want to go home and live peacefully , ’ said @entity283 , a 30 - year - old barber			2
he arrived at @entity248 in december with his wife after his two - year - old daughter , @entity286 , was shot dead by regime forces as he carried her across a street in @entity44			0
‘ the bullet hit her in the head and she was blown out of my arms , ’ he said			0
‘ it was the most terrible day of my life			0
’ on wednesday @entity3 ’s @entity295 said : ‘ we will not allow anything to compromise our national security or harm our citizens			1
’ on friday , at @entity3 ’s main border crossing with @entity20 , a burly guard ’s discourse on @entity304 ’s chances of success without sir @entity306 was brought to an abrupt halt by a burst of mortar fire			1
the loud boom broke the desert stillness and made the guard spring from his chair			0
jabbing the air with a cigarette , he estimated that it came from at least two miles away , which seemed to calm his colleagues			0
eventually their tension subsided , but did n’t disappear entirely			0
the men fell silent , their discussion about football and ‘ mr @entity306 ’ forgotten			0
despite the @entity295 ’s assurance , his people remain edgy			0
they simply ca n’t escape the feeling that @entity3 , a bit - part player , has been reluctantly shoved on to centre stage .			2

8,000 military personnel are behind @entity54 training exercise
arms from the @entity65 would have to travel through @entity3 to get to @entity20
it is believed this could enrage @entity70 , who may well seek revenge
