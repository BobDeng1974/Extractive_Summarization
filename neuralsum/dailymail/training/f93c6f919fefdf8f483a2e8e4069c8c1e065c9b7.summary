a @entity5 military parade to show - off armoured vehicles used in the fight against @entity3 rebels has backfired after a soldier fell off a tank , leaving him unconscious			1
the embarrassing accident happened during the exercise outside the city of @entity11 in south - eastern @entity5 's @entity13 region , where fierce fighting between regime soldiers and separatist forces has taken place in recent weeks			1
journalists were lined up along the road as the tank came rumbling past , packed with soldiers who were clinging to the top supposedly ready for battle			1
but as the tank swerved slightly to the right , one of the soldiers toppled off and landed heavily on the ground , lying there motionless afterwards and unable to move			1
witness @entity45 said : ' we all ran over but the soldier did n't get up			0
he was taken away and i do n't know what happened to him after that , as we were n't given any other information			0
' according to the @entity5 army 's own military rules , it is illegal to transport people on tanks in the winter and especially not when travelling more than 30 mph			1
however when it was posted online a lot of people have a less charitable interpretation , saying the soldier was obviously only looking for a ticket back home and away from the front line			1
the @entity5 military , which had been in control of @entity11 during the month - long siege by @entity3 rebels , were ordered to withdraw by @entity5 president @entity69 recently and after they left , @entity3 rebel forces began to enter the destroyed town			2
do n't stand up : the footage shows the soldier trying to stand to his position , and then losing his balance tumble : according to the @entity5 army 's own military rules , it is illegal to transport people on tanks in the winter and especially not when travelling more than 30 mph it was thought that the end to full - scale fighting in the strategically located city might give fresh hope to the ceasefire that was signed in @entity86 on feb. 12			1
however , as fighting in @entity11 began to scale down , shelling was reported in the port city of @entity89 in the south of @entity5 and in the city of @entity13 , a pro-rebel stronghold			2
the conflict has claimed the lives of 5,692 people and left 14,122 wounded , according to a @entity96 report			0
the true figure is likely to increase as @entity5 commanders account for the captured and missing troops			2
howitzers were seen moving east tuesday from the largest rebel - held city in eastern @entity5 further into separatist - controlled territory , but the @entity5 government disputed the rebels ' claim that a heavy weapons pullback had begun			2
a peace plan worked out in marathon talks on feb. 12 aims to create a wide buffer zone between separatists ' and @entity5 forces ' artillery as part of efforts to end the conflict that has left nearly 5,800 dead since april			2
the disagreement over a weapons pullback came as talks about a fragile peace deal for @entity5 were underway in @entity122 between the foreign ministers of @entity124 , @entity5 , @entity125 and @entity126			0
pain : the soldier landed heavily on the ground , lying there motionless afterwards and unable to move unconscious : witness @entity45 said : ' we all ran over but the soldier did n't get up			1
he was taken away and i do n't know what happened to him after that , as we were n't given any other information ' the supposed cease - fire in eastern @entity5 has been troubled by violations			0
on tuesday , military spokesman lt. col. @entity138 said rebels had shelled the town of @entity141 seven times and launched one barrage on the village of @entity145			0
@entity138 also said rebels tried to storm @entity5 positions near the southern village of @entity149 , which is near the strategic @entity151 port of @entity89			0
concerns persists that rebels aim to take @entity89 to help establish a land corridor between mainland @entity124 and the @entity155 , which @entity124 annexed last march			0
@entity124 denies @entity5 and @entity158 claims that it is supplying the rebels with troops and equipment , with the possible aim of a full - scale war			0
@entity124 president @entity166 , in an interview monday with state television , said ' such an apocalyptic scenario is hardly possible			0
' @entity158 officials and @entity169 insist , however , that satellite photos show that @entity124 military equipment is in eastern @entity5 .			1
