prosecutors want panels of the boat in which @entity4 bombing suspect @entity3 was found hiding to be brought to court to show jurors what they say is his written confession			1
his lawyers want them to see the entire bullet - ridden boat			2
prosecutors have said @entity3 scrawled the motive for the attack inside the boat			1
they say he referred to @entity20 wars in @entity22 countries and wrote , among other things , ' stop killing our innocent people and we will stop			0
a view of the bloodied and bullet - ridden message seen on the left in an image obtained by @entity38 above , another view of the boat message which reads in part : ' we @entity22 are one body			1
you kill one of us you hurt us all			0
' @entity3 's older brother , @entity45 , had been killed hours earlier during a shootout with police , but @entity3 escaped and was captured — bloodied and wounded — inside a boat parked in a backyard in @entity50			1
during a final pretrial hearing monday , @entity3 attorney @entity51 objected to the plan to bring pieces of the boat to court and suggested instead that the boat be brought to the courthouse so the jury can see the entire boat			1
he argued that the jury would be seeing the writing out of context if the panels were brought into the courtroom			2
to see the whole boat would allow the jury to imagine @entity3 lying inside ' much like someone lying in a crypt making those writings , ' @entity51 said			2
attorneys for @entity3 want the entire boat where their client was arrested brought to court to the jury can see how torn up it was in the firefight with police above , a picture of the moment @entity3 was taken into custody outside of the boat in @entity50 assistant u.s. attorney @entity80 argued that it would be impractical to bring the entire boat to the courthouse and that there are photographs of it that can be shown to the jury			1
he suggested that the defense wants the jury to see the boat — which contains bullet holes , blood stains and broken glass — to gain sympathy for @entity3			2
@entity3 's lawyers also asked judge @entity95 to exclude autopsy photos of the three people killed in the bombings			1
more than 260 people were hurt			0
' these are highly sensitive , highly disturbing images , ' said attorney @entity102			0
she said the defense will not dispute how the victims died			0
but assistant u.s. attorney @entity105 said prosecutors have to prove that the victims died from the use of a weapon of mass destruction , which is among the charges against @entity3			2
she said the full - body autopsy photos are necessary because they show all the wounds			0
the judge did not immediately rule on the motions			0
@entity3 's lawyers made it clear during the hearing that they will portray @entity3 as an adoring younger brother who was coerced by his older brother into participating in the deadly 2013 attack			2
although his lawyers had indicated they planned to argue that @entity3 , then 19 , was influenced by @entity45 , then 26 , they used their strongest language to date to describe how they will depict the brothers ' relationship and each of their roles in the attack			0
@entity3 's trial is set to start wednesday and is expected to last about three to four months			1
@entity3 pictured above in court on january 15 , 2015 @entity3 attorney @entity130 said prosecutors are trying to show a ' completely distorted ' picture of his client by asking the judge to limit the kind of evidence they can present during the initial phase of the trial , when the jury will be asked to decide whether @entity3 is guilty of 30 charges			1
@entity130 , arguing that the defense should be entitled to present evidence of @entity45 's role in the attack , called him the ' lead conspirator ... but for whom the @entity147 would never have occurred			0
' @entity130 said the defense should be allowed to present evidence that the motive ' may well have been the defendant 's domination by , love for , adoration of , submissiveness to ... his older brother			0
' ' that is fair game , ' @entity130 said			0
assistant u.s. attorney @entity159 argued that the defense plans to try to include mitigating evidence during the guilt phase of the trial , when that should be reserved for the second phase of the trial — known as the penalty phase — when the jury will be asked to decide @entity3 's punishment : life in prison or the death penalty			1
opening statements in @entity3 's trial are scheduled for wednesday			1
the trial is expected to last three to four months .			0

defense attorneys for @entity3 *petitioned* to bring the entire boat where he was captured to court so jury could see damage from firefight
prosecutors said it was *n't* *realistic* to bring the entire *vessel* to court , and that pictures of the boat would suffice
however , they do want panels from inside the boat brought to court which they say contain 's @entity3 's confession note
it reads : ' we @entity22 are one body . you kill one of us , you hurt us all '
the judge did not rule on either motions on monday - two days before the start of the trial
the trial is expected to last three to four months
