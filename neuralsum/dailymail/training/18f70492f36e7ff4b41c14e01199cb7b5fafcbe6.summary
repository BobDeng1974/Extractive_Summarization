by @entity0 we 've heard all the excuses about leaves on the line , or the wrong kind of snow			0
but @entity7 trains have come up with a new reason for cancelling journeys : the staff have gone to @entity11 's			1
a rush hour service from @entity13 to @entity14 was cancelled on tuesday because the guard could not be found			1
( file picture ) passengers on a rush hour service from @entity13 to @entity14 had their service cancelled because the guard could not be found he was later spotted in @entity11 's , but refused to get on the train because he was having his break so the next train was cancelled			1
finally – and with three train loads of passengers on one train – the service departed , delaying commuters by at least an hour			1
customers branded the experience a ' nightmare ' and said @entity7 fares were a ' rip - off ' while mps criticised the company 's ' poor customer service '			1
it is just the latest debacle for the railway line , which was voted the worst for passenger satisfaction earlier this year			0
it also raised fares by 2.8per cent two months ago			2
last night , commuter @entity41 branded @entity7 services – which costs her £ 2,850 for six months travel between @entity13 and @entity14 – a ' rip - off '			1
the civil servant and mother - of - one had been returning home from work in @entity48 to get a connection in @entity13 to @entity14			1
( file picture ) the guard was seen going into a branch of @entity11 's for his lunch she was supposed to get the 7.23pm train from @entity56 , but this was cancelled			1
she then got on the 7.53pm train , but this was delayed as the guard had ' gone missing '			2
half an hour later , the driver told passengers that they had now located the guard who had been delayed on another train but said that he was in @entity11 's and had decided to take his break			1
the train was then cancelled and the passengers loaded on to another train			2
mrs @entity41 said : ' no one on that train had had a break in as long as they can remember			2
they had been on the go from the crack of dawn			0
' we were sat there thinking : “ how much of a break does this guy need ? how labour intensive is his job really ? when was the last time i had ten minutes to pop to @entity11 's for my lunch ? or did i take sandwiches because i ca n't actually leave my desk ? ” so he had no sympathy			1
' ' there were three trainloads of people on one train			0
we were more than an hour delayed and everyone was squashed in like sardines			2
' it 's such a rip - off and such a poor service			1
' earlier this year , @entity7 finished joint bottom of a which ? survey for passenger satisfaction , with just 40per cent of commuters saying it runs a good service			2
the railway line , which runs services from @entity107 and east @entity108 into @entity13 , was also given just one out of five stars for ' value for money ' journeys			1
but it argued that the reason passengers did not rate its service was because it took them to work			1
it said that it was prone to perform badly in passenger surveys because it ' takes people somewhere they do n't want to be with money they do n't want to pay '			0
and after being slated for its decision to raise fares by 2.8 per cent , a spokesman said : ' when your council tax demand arrives nobody fires off a cheque with pleasure '			2
he also said that if the surveys were carried out on a ' sunny summer 's day ' they would fare better as passengers would be more ' upbeat '			2
@entity134 mp , whose constituency of @entity14 and @entity136 is served by @entity7 , said the company offered ' poor customer service ' and were ' disappointing '			1
she said : ' my constituents understand that extraordinary weather has caused infrastructure damage			0
what they ca n't understand is the lack of clear information and poor customer service that they receive from @entity7			0
' it has been a very disappointing experience			0
@entity7 must up their game if they want to get their franchise renewed			0
' last night , a spokesperson from @entity7 said : ' we 're really sorry to customers caught up in the problems last night			0
we 're looking into what happened – we can certainly understand passengers ' anger here			0
' while frustrating for people who rightly just want to get home , anyone working in safety critical roles are required to take breaks after working a certain amount of hours			0
' the shift timing was thrown out of place because of a knock - on effect of earlier delays , and we did n't have a standby conductor available to work the train in his place			0
' we 'd encourage all passengers caught up in the problems to claim for compensation for the delay			0
information about how to claim is available on our website			0
