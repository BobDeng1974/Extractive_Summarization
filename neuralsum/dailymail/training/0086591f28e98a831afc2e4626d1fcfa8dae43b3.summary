@entity0 , 14 , hanged herself in her bedroom ten days ago after being targeted by trolls on @entity2			1
but the social networking site insists that she set up most of the anonymous identities used to bombard her own page , it has been reported			0
a source at the firm based in @entity13 , @entity14 , said : ‘ with the @entity0 case , the company have looked at every identity – the [ computer ] ip addresses are trackable			1
she posted the anonymous things herself			0
’ last night @entity0 ’s father @entity21 , 45 , reacted with anger to the allegation			1
‘ @entity0 was a 14 - year - old girl who was being bullied and she took her own life , ’ he said			1
‘ @entity2 is trying to cover its own back by discrediting @entity0			1
’ the firm claims that up to 98 per cent of the messages sent to @entity0 came from the same ip address as her own computer			1
only four posts were sent from a different machine , it has been reported			2
@entity2 allows users to ask questions or invite them from other members but they can remain anonymous , allowing trolls to pick out @entity38 , a lorry driver from @entity39 , @entity40 , added that the issue was not if @entity0 had sent any of the messages			1

’ @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , who founded @entity2 , an internal investigation is said to have revealed that 98 per cent of the messages were sent from a computer with the same ip address as @entity0 's row : @entity2 has said previously it does not take responsibility for what is on its site and does not monitor posts last night , a source close to @entity2 said it was conceivable that @entity0 may have posted some of the hate messages herself			1
