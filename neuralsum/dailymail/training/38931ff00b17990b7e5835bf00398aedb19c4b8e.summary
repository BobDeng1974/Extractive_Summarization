' there are downsides to overconfidence ; people can feel a bit repelled by it			0
the comments come after @entity34 actor @entity33 revealed that going to @entity35 was the perfect training for his upcoming role as @entity38 the 43 - year - old , who has become one of @entity43 ’s biggest acting exports after making his name with roles in @entity34 and @entity46 , speaking to @entity47 , he said : ‘ i think there is no question that it helps having had the kind of schooling i ’ve had to play a king			1
‘ it ’s not such a leap oddly – even though the thought of being a monarch of any nation is mind - boggling and not something i could imagine easily at all			2
‘ but , yes , there ’s just the sort of court structure , hierarchies and the way they are set up which is something i understand			0
’ his comments came after he compared his obe , which he received on wednesday afternoon , to being made a school prefect , as he felt it put him under pressure to be extremely responsible and to prove himself			2
' i remember when i heard i was being awarded it , it was a little bit like " now you 've got to prove it " , ' he said			0
' it was a bit like being asked to be a prefect , now i have to be extremely responsible			2
' mr @entity4 clarified his comments to the @entity82			1
he said : ' they ( independent schools ) obviously do a fantastic job with most kids , who have a real joy taking part in society			2
' what i mean to say , is that we as schools have a responsibility to the children to make sure they do not leave with an excessive sense of entitlement			0
' it is important that independent schools ensure that students leave with a sense of debt , not to us , but to society			1
' many , not all , have had very fortunate upbringings			0
' so many good things , for all of us in the rich west , can make us complacent in the real world			0
' he said @entity111 hero captain @entity110 - was an inspirational example of a privately educated man who gave back to society			1
it comes after @entity34 actor @entity33 revealed that going to @entity35 was the perfect training for his upcoming role as @entity38 educated at @entity119 in @entity120 , @entity118 is one of only three people to be awarded a @entity122 twice			1
he said : ' he had a fantastic education , but he was not a great charmer or a conformist			2
he was actually quite a difficult man , stubbornly dedicated to the health , wealth and welfare of his men and an incredibly brave captain who saved hundreds of lives			0
' at @entity132 , mr @entity4 said students do not have lessons on a friday afternoon and instead do activities with 27 local state schools as part of a partnership programme			1
he said : ' that to me is what we should be doing more of			0
we should be out there playing our part in a world which is there to be improved and made healthier			0
' i 'm not trying to show off about @entity132 , and i must sound very hypocritical , but that 's my job and i have to try and help these fortunate and good men and women feel commitment to improving circumstances			0
' and they do have that commitment and love for doing good things			0
' he has also warned recently that private schools were in danger of becoming the preserve of wealthy oligarchs as fee hikes price out middle - class families			1
he warned that many parents in traditionally well - paid careers as accountancy and law were no longer able to afford a private education for their children			1
the most expensive private schools were becoming little more than ‘ finishing schools for the children of oligarchs ’ , he said			2
some schools had become so reliant on pupils from overseas they were at risk of suffering a banking - style crash			1
the actor , 43 , said his obe honour , presented by the @entity181 , was as a complete surprise , and added : ' it was a bit like being asked to be a prefect , now i have to be extremely responsible ' prepared : @entity33 said his time at @entity188 boarding school @entity35 ( pictured ) had helped him with his latest role fifty private schools in recent years had closed , merged with another school or joined the state system , he said			1
mr @entity4 , whose school charges fees for day pupils of £ 19,500 - a - year , said : ‘ we have allowed the apparently endless queue of wealthy families from across the world knocking at our doors to blind us to a simple truth : we charge too much			1
‘ somewhere along the way , first the nurses stopped sending children to us , then the policemen , then armed forces officers , then even the local accountants and lawyers			0
‘ the most prestigious schools in the world teach the children of the very wealthiest families in the world			0
a typical boarding school now requires a parent to have a spare £ 30,000 in taxed income to pay for just one child — every year			0
‘ we are in danger of coming across as greedy , because we can charge what appears to be limitless fees but in truth there is a fees timebomb ticking away			0
it feels like the build - up to the banking crisis			2
for the first time in my career , i feel that the shifts over the next 10 years could prove seismic			0
