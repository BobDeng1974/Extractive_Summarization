by @entity0 if you go down to the woods today , you 're sure of a big surprise			0
at least , you are if you 're this mother black bear - whose mischievous cub played a trick on her by hiding behind a tree trunk			1
photographer @entity8 , 51 , captured the magical moment between mother and baby in the @entity12 of western @entity13			1
i 'm bear - hind you : the black bear cub hid out of the way of its mother 's gaze in @entity13 's @entity12			1
there are thought to be at least 600,000 black bears in @entity22 , spread across mostly the north of the @entity24 and @entity25			1
they eat plants , fruits , nuts and insects but will also kill salmon and occasionally young deer mr @entity8 , from @entity33 said : ' i was surprised when the cubs descended from the top of the large pine tree to see what their mother was up to			1
' i was ecstatic to capture the curious expression of this cub peering around the trunk of the tree at its mother			2
' this photo turned out to be my favorite photo of the trip			2
' much of my time was spent patiently watching them rest in thick foliage , eagerly waiting for them to come out into the open and be active			0
' i used camouflaged clothing to help blend myself into the environment , but i also used a super telephoto camera lens to keep me at a distance comfortable for the bears and safe for me			0
' @entity56 : the mother bear 's two cubs were pictured clambering up a tree to play as she remained on the ground , scratching herself on a tree trunk			1
black bear cubs remain with their mother for about a year after they stop being weaned			2
they are formidable climbers , with the natural advantage of their short , non-retractable claws there are an estimated 600,000 black bears in @entity22 , the largest of which have been known to weigh 600lbs			1
they most commonly eat plants , insects , fruits , nuts and honey , but also kill salmon as they swim upstream to spawn , and occasionally kill and eat baby deer or moose calves			2
during hibernation , they can live for more than six months without food			0
the bears tend to roam and forage for food alone - with the exception of mothers when they are raising cubs			0
females have up to six cubs , with two the norm , and they continue caring for their young for a year after they stop being weaned from their mother 's teat			0
the bears are intelligent with colour vision and can run at up to 35mph , but typically they are shy and easily frightened			0
attacks on humans are rare and said to be less likely than being killed by a bee sting			0
bear necessities : one of the black bear 's two cubs was spotted sheltering midway up a tree as his mother scratched her back on the bark patient : the photos were taken by wildlife photographer @entity8 , 51			1
