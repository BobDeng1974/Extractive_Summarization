the greatness of dame @entity1 lies in the fact that her finest sporting achievement proved to be a beginning and not an end			1
this was further recognised on tuesday evening when she was named as a member of the @entity9 in the @entity10			0
she becomes only the second sports figure , after @entity12 , to be elevated into such company usually reserved for luminaries of the arts , science and politics			0
athlete @entity1 at @entity18 in @entity19 in 2000 after she was invested as a dame commander as with @entity12 , it is largely recognition for what @entity23 , 75 , has done since winning an olympic gold medal in the days when such things had enormous rarity value among @entity29 athletes			1
‘ i am thrilled to receive such a prestigious honour , being one of only 47 @entity9 in the @entity29 , it was totally unexpected , ’ she said on tuesday after becoming @entity29 sport ’s most decorated woman			1
‘ everything i have done in my interesting life has been a gift so there was no need for recognition			0
i have been so privileged			0
’ many will see this as fitting reward for someone who is too seldom associated with that admittedly well - worn tag of @entity45			0
that is , perhaps , because she has happily identified herself with one specific part of the kingdom , @entity49 , since dramatically winning @entity29 ’s solitary gold , in the pentathlon , at @entity52 in 1972			2
@entity1 celebrates crossing the line during the 1972 olympics where she picked up gold in the pentathlon dame @entity23 attempts a successful jump during the high jump event of the 1972 olympic games in @entity52 barely had the bauble been placed around her neck than she was receiving a death threat from the @entity63 at a time when the @entity65 were raging at their most disturbing pitch			1
‘ @entity1 is a @entity71 and has won a medal for @entity29			1
an attempt will be made on her life and it will be blamed on the @entity63 … her home will going up in the near future , ’ a chilling @entity68 voice told the @entity69 in a phone call			0
far from being intimidated , she insisted on returning home immediately to share her success with the place she had long since fallen in love with having moved there from @entity82 as an 11 - year - old			1
‘ i ’m going straight to @entity84 , ’ she declared			2
@entity85 joins dame @entity1 during a visit to @entity84 in @entity49 this summer after arriving at the heavily fortified airport , she was paraded on an open - top truck down @entity89 , barely a month after 22 bombs had been detonated in the city on one single day			1
protestants and @entity93 alike famously lined the streets together to acclaim her			0
ever since that day she has proved to be a great friend to all sections of the community there , working tirelessly to unite people , raise money for sport and good causes , and act as an ambassador for the province			1
tuesday 's honour was the latest in a progression which began , inevitably , by being named @entity106 shortly after triumph in @entity108			1
following on were an @entity109 , @entity109 and her promotion to @entity109 ( dame commander ) in 2000			2
@entity1 presents @entity112 with a @entity113 on behalf of the @entity114 in 2013 on a purely sporting basis her achievement in winning gold was remarkable			1
having shown athletic prowess as a teenager , she was encouraged by her father , who bought in two tonnes of sand to create a practice area for the long jump in a nearby field			0
he also bought enough cement to create a shot putt circle to perfect what would be her best discipline			0
she missed out by one place on a bronze medal in 1964 and came ninth at @entity132 in 1968			0
as she recalled , getting to training on the track at @entity135 in those times was often not easy due to frequent disruption caused by the @entity65			0
at 33 , @entity52 would be her last chance , but she was up against the strongly favoured @entity140 @entity139			0
@entity1 led after the first day but endured a sleepless night in which ‘ every time i looked at my watch it seemed the hands had moved backwards ’			2
standing on the podium in @entity52 , @entity1 acknowledges the crowd having won a gold medal in the pentathlon @entity139 had her two best events to come and trailed by just 47 points when they lined up for the final 200metres			1
@entity1 managed her fourth personal best out of five but lost by 10 metres , and then followed an agonising few minutes while officials worked out the totals			1
with both competitors surrounded by photographers during the unbearable wait , @entity1 only knew she had won when @entity139 sportingly held out her arms and congratulated her			1
she had won by a mere 10 points with a world - record score			2
the next day was to become the blackest in @entity164 history , as the massacre of @entity167 athletes began , as if @entity1 needed reminding of such horrors			2
@entity1 was made dame in 2000 for services to @entity170 and to the community in @entity49 she did not need to make her future in @entity49 afterwards , receiving job offers from as far away as @entity174 and @entity175 , but chose to stay and use her fame to make @entity84 a better place			1
blessed with a natural openness and matronly warmth , she first raised enough money to resurface the cinder track at @entity135			0
she has held nine chairmanship , president and vice-president positions on various boards and , in 2009 , became lord lieutenant of @entity84			2
aside from anything , she blazed a trail for the likes of @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 to establish multi-sport competition as something of a @entity29 speciality , and they will have joined in hailing the latest honour .			0

the 75 - year - old won gold in the pentathlon at the @entity201
has worked tirelessly to unite people , raise money for sport and good causes in the @entity84 community . an ambassador for the region
