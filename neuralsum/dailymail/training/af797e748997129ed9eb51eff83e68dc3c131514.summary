by @entity0 published : 10:33 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 13:58 est , 6 september 2013 when @entity2 bought @entity3 from her former owner , she thought it was a gesture of compassion for an unremarkable animal			1
she had paid £ 450 for the beautiful 23 - year - old chestnut horse , who could have been sent to the slaughterhouse , after her owner realised @entity3 was much older than previously thought			1
though she thought she had ' seen something special ' in the ageing animal , mrs @entity2 , 54 , never thought to look in to her past until her curiosity was stirred by the animal 's exceptional grace when being ridden by a friend			2
@entity2 bought @entity3 , a beautiful 23 - year - old chestnut to save her from the slaughterhouse			1
but she had no idea of her polo - star past			2
but in fact @entity3 was still competing very recently - and is pictured here here being ridden by @entity25 at the @entity26 in may this year but after investigating @entity3 's pedigree , mrs @entity2 was stunned to discover that @entity3 was one of the world 's greatest polo horses , who moved in the same circles as the @entity32			1
calls to a vet who had formerly cared for @entity3 revealed that the chestnut mare was once the mount of polo legend @entity37 , a man who was once considered the greatest player in the world			1
mr @entity37 is also a friend of @entity41 , and his former coach , who also trained prince @entity43 and prince @entity44			1
mrs @entity2 , a mother of two , had been looking for a horse to care for in her rural @entity47 home , and fell in love with @entity3 as soon as she saw her			1
her former owner had bought @entity3 under the false impression that she was just 13 , and resolved to sell her quickly or - if that was n't possible - send her to slaughter			1
mrs @entity2 said : ‘ as soon as a friend told me about @entity3 i went to see her and i was struck by just how beautiful she was			1
@entity3 was also formerly owned by @entity37 ( centre ) who coached @entity41 ( right ) , here wearing the number 4 polo shirt ‘ she was facing a very uncertain fate and i did n’t want to see her suffer			1
i saw something special in her and bought her			0
‘ @entity3 had been passed between dealers and did n’t have a proper home			2
the last owner had n’t done their maths properly and thought she was only 13			0
‘ when they worked out her true age they simply did n’t want her			0
’ mrs @entity2 decided to research @entity3 ’s history when she saw her being ridden by a family friend and suspected the graceful animal was a thoroughbred			1
she said : ‘ i had her passport and there was one stamp from an @entity75 vet			0
when i called him and said @entity3 ’s name , he said he would call me back in 10 minutes			0
‘ he then phoned and confirmed it was the well - known polo horse			2
' the association with prince @entity41 , left , and @entity37 , right , proves @entity3 's place on the polo scene she also discovered that @entity3 had more recently been owned by socialite @entity25 , who had ridden her competitively as recently as this year			1
she managed to contact mr @entity25 , who was shocked to hear how close the ' extremely special ' horse had come to death			0
mrs @entity2 also contacted mr @entity25 who was shocked to hear his former mare had come so close to being destroyed			0
mr @entity25 , from @entity84 , @entity85 , said : ‘ she is an extremely special horse			0
we had a great connection and were very much in tune with one another			0
‘ i had her for around six years and she ’s one of the best horses i ever rode			0
i rode her at the @entity26 this year in the gaucho international polo event			0
she was such a reliable horse			0
‘ she recently suffered from an injury and because of her age , i thought it was best that she retired as i thought it was unfair to keep playing her			0
‘ it ’s great to know that she is being loved and well looked - after by @entity2			2
it would be great to visit @entity100 , to meet @entity2 and visit her in her new home			2

@entity2 wanted to give an old horse a home in rural @entity47
she bought 23 - year - old @entity3 to save her from being slaughtered
but it later *emerged* she was ridden by polo star @entity37
he was the former coach of @entity110 , @entity43 and @entity44
