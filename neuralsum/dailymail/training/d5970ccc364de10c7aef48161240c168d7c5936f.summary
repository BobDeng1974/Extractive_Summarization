former @entity1 goalkeeper @entity0 has criticised @entity3 's @entity2 by stating the @entity4 shot stopper 's handling ' is n't the best '			1
@entity0 joked that @entity2 is among his current top 20 @entity8 goalkeepers but added he did not feature high up on his list			2
writing in his @entity12 blog , @entity0 said : ' all i can say about @entity2 is he 's definitely in my top 20 of @entity8 goalkeepers			1
when they first bought him , i was surprised			0
' when you think of the great @entity3 goalkeepers @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity19 , @entity20 - he never struck me as a player capable of hitting those standards			0
' his shot - stopping is good , his distribution is decent , but he is n't the best on crosses			0
' @entity0 believes the current standard of goalkeepers in the @entity8 is ' poor '			1
he added : ' @entity36 is world class , but after that , i 'm not convinced			1
' @entity39 has come on a tonne and could enter that world class bracket in time and @entity43 at @entity44 looks like the real deal , but being world class comes from concentration and long term consistency			2
' @entity39 and @entity36 are among the three best goalkeepers in the league , according to @entity0			0

@entity0 was ' surprised ' by @entity3 's *decision* to sign @entity2 from @entity53 in june 2013

@entity0 believes @entity36 is the only world class keeper in @entity58
