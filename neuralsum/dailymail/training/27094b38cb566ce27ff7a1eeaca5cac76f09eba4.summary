much was made of the lacklustre performance , which only generated two shots of target , one being @entity0 's 68th minute penalty			2

' when you do add players of that type , like ( @entity136 ) @entity135 , ( @entity137 ) @entity138 and ( @entity140 ) @entity139 , and you add to that @entity83 coming in field , picking up the ball and whizzing past people every time he gets it , it does at to that excitement and it is another major weapon in your armoury , ' the @entity2 manager said			2
