@entity0 has come under heavy criticism for refusing to remove extremely graphic pictures of a war veterans suicide posted to the social media giant on sunday despite the pleas of his family and friends , grisly images of former @entity11 @entity10 remained online until wednesday , after he took his own life in a @entity13 , @entity15 squat			1
@entity0 initially told his loved ones that the gruesome pictures of deep puncture wounds on his legs captioned with heartbreaking goodbye messages did not violate their community standards , outraging them and veteran 's organizations			1
tragedy : @entity10 took his own life on sunday night or monday morning and updated @entity0 with pictures of his suicide despite repeated calls over two days to remove the photographs , @entity0 at first refused to budge on the issue			1
according to an investigation by @entity32 , @entity0 justified not removing the photographs because they make a distinction between cases of someone who is documenting their own self - harm as opposed to someone promoting others self - harm			2
a spokesperson for @entity0 told @entity32 they ' have been advised by experts in that space that removing content could be detrimental ' in the case of those committing self - harm			0
in essence , if they removed cries for help , then family and friends would not know to intervene			2
' @entity0 has long relied on guidance from suicide prevention and other mental health experts to equip friends and others to take action when they notice a friend in distress , ' said a spokesman for @entity0 to @entity62			1
' as part of this approach , we ’ve been advised of the importance of allowing images of self - harm to remain on @entity0 since they are legitimate cries for help and will increase the likelihood a friend reaches them in time			2
' we of course remove content reported to us for encouraging or promoting self - harm			0
' indeed , @entity78 's friends and family did respond to his horrifying pictures almost immediately , desperately trying to reach him and find him			2
strength : @entity83 was known by his comrades as a good friend and soldier who found re-adjusting to civilian life difficult warning : @entity83 posted this to his @entity0 page on sunday evening - heralding his suicide requests : @entity78 began to worry his friends and family when messages like this started to appear heartbreaking : the mental anguish that @entity78 was going through was clear in this message definite : @entity83 re-iterated his desire for a funeral fit for a warrior the father - of - one was reportedly suffering from deep depression brought on by money problems and an undiagnosed case of @entity105			1
he had become known as a drifter in the @entity13 suburb of @entity108 , ' going from place to place ' and police thought of him not as a trouble maker , but as someone ' down on his luck			0
' on sunday night , his troubled state of mind became clear when he posted a series of messages that increased in morbidity with each subsequent update			0
' the only fight i ever lost was the one to myself , ' wrote @entity78 on sunday night , followed by ' when my body moves no more give me a vikings funeral			0
' directly after that @entity78 uploaded four pictures - one of a half - empty bottle of vodka , with the caption , ' @entity130 b * * * * s ' - and the other three showing where he had cut himself			0
this caused his friends to launch into full - on panic stations as they pleaded with him to snap out of it and to contact the @entity136			0
reaching out : @entity83 's friends and family tried their best to help the stricken soldier gruesome : this is the worst picture ( heavily blurred by @entity62 ) that @entity78 posted to @entity0 with the caption , ' i 'm leaking good now ' in the final , awful picture of his mutilated leg , @entity78 comments , ' i 'm leaking good now			1
' @entity108 police found @entity78 dead in an ' unoccupied dwelling ' on tuesday evening and informed his family			0
however , the tragic last pictures he posted were still on @entity0 and so his family asked the social media site to remove them			1
@entity32 was contacted by the family after their attempts to report the images of @entity78 's suicide were rebuffed			2
' we reviewed the photo you reported for containing graphic violence and found it does n't violate our community standards , ' was @entity0 's initial reply			1
the veteran 's @entity136 asked @entity0 to remove them , but they too were met with a brick wall			0
' it hurt and outraged me , ' said @entity78 's former comrade @entity169 to @entity32			0
standards : this was the message that @entity0 provided when asked to remove the photographs ' when we would report the pictures they would tell us thank you for trying to make @entity0 a safer place , but the images did n't violate their terms and conditions			1
' when it clearly says images of self harm and mutilation are against their policy			0
how does leaving those pictures up make @entity0 safer ? ' despite accepting @entity0 's justification that images posted by those in distress can be extremely important , @entity78 's friends and family wanted to know why the pictures of a dead man could n't be removed			1
@entity0 replied that in these cases the family is contacted and asked if they want their deceased relative 's page to stay up in memorial or to be deleted			2
in this case however , @entity78 's family were more concerned with the length of time the images were still online for			2
eventually , even though the photographs apparently did not violate @entity0 's standards , they were only removed because the family asked			1
in response to the tragedy and controversy a @entity0 spokesman said , ' we ’re saddened by this tragedy and offer our deepest sympathies to mr. @entity10 ’s friends and family , particularly those who worked so quickly to reach him during his time of need , ' as soon as people reported these posts and photos to @entity0 , we immediately suggested a crisis hotline and attempted to connect mr. @entity10 with specific suicide prevention resources			1
' his friends took action and notified police as well as the @entity226			0
despite their swift response , we were notified of mr. @entity10 ’s death and unpublished his profile			0
