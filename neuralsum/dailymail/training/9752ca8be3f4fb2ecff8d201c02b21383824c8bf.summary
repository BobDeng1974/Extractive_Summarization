by @entity0 published : 13:15 est , 13 march 2014 updated : 13:15 est , 13 march 2014 a mysterious golden eagle with bells on its feet has been spotted by a group of cyclists in @entity7			1
the huge bird , which is exceptionally rare in the @entity9 , appeared tame and even allowed some of the group touch it			1
experts insist the creature must have escaped from a sanctuary , but police in the area say they have not received reports from any sanctuaries or bird parks			1
cyclists spotted a golden eagle perched near the cycle path on the @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity7 the bird allowed mountain biker @entity27 to touch and stroke it the cyclists were cycling along a trail in the @entity24 in @entity25 when they came across the eagle			1
mountain cyclists @entity34 and her husband @entity27 said the massive bird was not distressed by group 's presence and even let them stroke it			2
she added : ' it is obviously tame and lost but could cause damage or take local lambs if it gets very hungry			0
' it is also huge and so could easily frighten the public - it allowed us to come very close			2
' no doubt someone is very anxious to have lost this bird			0
' cyclists @entity34 and husband @entity27 said they are sure someone must be missing the bird golden eagles are now extremely rare in @entity9 and usually keep to remote mountains and hills the cyclists are worried the lost bird may attack farm animals in the area if it is not returned to its owner a spokesman for the @entity63 said the birds were once common across @entity9 's mountains and hills , but are now mostly found at bird parks and zoos			1
he added : ' this bird is likely to be an escapee rather than a wild golden eagle			2
' they are commonly kept as falconerâ € ™ s birds or in bird of prey centres so this one is likely to have got away from its owner			0
' the spokesman added that golden eagles were once found in upland areas in many parts of the @entity9			0
' however , persecution pushed these birds to extinction in @entity84 and @entity7 by 1850			0
' they are now almost entirely restricted to @entity86			0
sadly , the persecution of golden eagles and other birds of prey continues to this day			0
' @entity90 say they have received no reports of a missing eagle meaning the bird 's owner remains a mystery the estimated 440 pairs of eagles living in the @entity9 are thought to be confined to @entity86 are extremely rare in @entity7			1

mountain bikers were *shocked* to see the huge *predator* of the @entity24 in @entity25
the rare bird , which usually only lives in the @entity103 , even allowed some of group to touch it
@entity63 say the beast , which had bells on its feet , must be an escapee from a nearby sanctuary or bird park
but police in @entity25 , @entity7 say owner has yet to come *forward* and report it missing
