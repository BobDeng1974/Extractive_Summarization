and parents have branded the decision ' a scandal ' as only twenty per cent of the 600 pupils are @entity31 and the decision to provide halal meat was up to individual schools in the town			1
a mother with an 11 - year - old girl at the school , who asked not to be named for fear of being branded racist , said : ' at home i pay more for organic and free range food			0
i am a @entity61 but i do n’t do it because of that , it ’s more for the respect of how animals are killed			0
' the way the animals are slaughtered for halal meat is a religious killing and i do n’t feel it should be in schools			1
' my daughter has been anxious about the change as she has concerns about if it is humane killing			2
i believe in animal welfare rights and standards of meat production that halal does not follow			2
the school governors at both schools are understood to have agreed to the menu change to ensure the meals are more inclusive ' i feel as strongly against eating meat that had been blessed in the name of a god i do n’t believe in and the animal killed in a way i do not agree with , as @entity31 do against eating non-halal meat			1
' the children love pork and it ’s a scandal to take these meats off the menu to please , what i consider to be , a low number of children who require halal meat			1
' the majority of the children are now having school meals that are made for the minority			0
the halal children have always had the vegetarian and fish options			0
' another mum of a son at the school said she believed that halal slaughtering was cruel			2
she added : ' my son is a really fussy eater and pork is his favourite meat			2
he ’ll get bored having chicken all the time			0
' a mother of two said parents who do not know much about halal meat had not been given enough information or time to understand it			1
she said : ' normally the school is good at consulting parents but with this we have just been told what is going to happen			0
' i ’d want to know more about halal meat before i ’d be happy for my children to eat it			2
i ’ve been told it is not as well refrigerated			0
' it would have been good to have know what @entity31 parents thought and if they were unhappy with the vegetarian option on the menu			0
' halal slaughter is performed by a @entity31 butcher in the name of @entity136 in a way to avoid severing the spinal cord			2
