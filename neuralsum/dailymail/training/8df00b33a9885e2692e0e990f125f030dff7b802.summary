@entity1 , @entity2 , @entity3 ... just when you think you 've seen them all , a new reality show turns up as the new kid on the block			1
this week , it was the turn of @entity9 - a reality show that stars six wags from a county famous for footballers and excess			1
each of the women had enough sparkle , slap and sass to outshine even the brassiest drag queen from @entity21 's @entity20 , but there was one housewife who appeared head and shoulders above the rest - @entity26			1
the @entity32 of @entity34 star also claims that @entity35 have a stigma of hatred to people who lead luxurious lives @entity26 , 32 , got married to @entity40 , 54 , a multi-millionaire businessman in her twenties and the couple lived an an enormous mansion in @entity28 , @entity34 , together			1
but the couple have since divorced and the former glamour model has now set up her own beauty salon in order to keep the cash rolling in			1
despite not actually having the only credential needed to be on @entity34 - being a wife - it is clear why @entity53 producers picked her as part of the six - woman cast ; she speaks her mind and more			2
in the first episode of the reality show , @entity26 tells cameras : ' i 'm not a little rag doll - i 'll play with the toys , and when i 'm done with you , i 'll discard you			1
' and when i meet her this week at the @entity66 studios in @entity21 , she is exactly the same			2
even though it is midday on a rainy weekday afternoon , @entity26 is dressed to the nines in vertiginous heels and a tight strapless dress , and wearing more make - up and hairspray than i use in a month			1
@entity26 with her fellow @entity34 stars @entity26 is @entity75 tall and beautiful , with a mega-watt smile ... and she knows it			1
she is also unapologetic about how she achieved her lifestyle ( by marrying a rich older man ) and in the first few minutes of out conversation , freely admits that she would never again date someone with a normal - paying job like a fireman			1
when i ask her how she feels about being called a scrounger and a gold - digger , she smiles back , completely unconcerned			2
she says : ' at the end of the day , it 's very sad , but beauty is currency and if you 're a good - looking girl , you 've got the options			2
' if a guy comes along and says he is happy to look after you , and he will give you this fabulous lifestyle , if you want to engage in that , then what is the harm ? ' it is n't hurting anybody			2
' i have been on both sides of the coin ; i have had a very privileged life where i have n't lifted a finger , but i 've also come back down to earth now and i 'm back to the girl that i was before i met my ex-husband - i work seven days a week			2
' it does n't make me a better person or a lesser person			2
' this country has got a stigma of hatred towards people that lead very luxurious lives , they 're very jealous and envious			1
' i 'm really sorry that your six numbers did n't come up on the lottery this week - it 's not my problem			2
' @entity26 in one of her regular @entity124 pictures @entity26 was raised by her father in @entity126 and went to a private boarding school , but after leaving at 18 , she struck out on her own and was earning very little compared to what she has now			1
she met @entity40 in her early twenties and the couple 's relationship quickly turned serious			2
their 18 - year age gap meant that she was heavily criticised by people in her new boyfriend 's social circle though and made to feel like a gold digger			1
she said : ' i had a job when i first met him and i was n't dependent on his finances , but it was n't on the same level			2
' and i know that a lot of people judged me for getting with someone a lot older			1
i did say to him , " you 're getting involved in a relationship with me but i do n't bring that much to the equation , so people automatically think that i sponge off you			1
" ' he told me , " at the end of the day sweetheart , i 'm marrying a woman who is 22 years younger than me who 's good eye candy			1
i 'm going to expect people to think that			1
' " but i 'm happy to look after you and for you to be my wife			2
and if other people have a problem with that , then it is their problem			1
it 's not our problem			2
" ' and i thought , that 's fair enough			0
' the couple were married for a few years , but unable to overcome certain differences , they split a several years ago			0
however , they remain the best of friends and talk on a regular basis			0
@entity26 enjoys many perks of having wealth , including work outs with a personal trainer @entity26 in the beauty salon that she owns in @entity28 , with @entity181 and @entity182 but while @entity26 's ex was able to overlook the fact that she had little money compared to him when they got together , she claims that she would never be able to do the same with any future boyfriends			1
when i ask if she would consider dating someone with a ' normal ' salary , like a fireman , she shakes her head immediately			0
she says : ' i would be dubious to let my guard down emotionally because i would wonder if he was coming after me for what i had			0
' my natural instincts would come up and i would n't allow myself to fall for them			0
' because although that person could be ticking all of my boxes , and i could tick all of his , that fear of someone coming into my lifestyle , not because they want me , but because of what i have and all of the trappings that come with that , would automatically make me press the eject button			0
' @entity26 's lifestyle definitely has trappings			1
she regularly attends champagne - fuelled , red carpet parties in @entity34 and also frequents @entity212 bashes held by the likes of @entity214			0
she still lives in a house that costs upwards of Â£ 1million and owns 45 pieces of diamond jewelry			1
@entity26 and her friend @entity219 at the @entity220 in 2013 even the other @entity221 are impressed with the size of her walk - in wardrobe at home			1
she admits : ' my wardrobe is like the @entity228 clearance sale - everything is crammed on every rail and there are handbags shoved everywhere			0
' it is this millionaire lifestyle that makes the leggy brunette convinced that their television show will become bigger than both @entity2 and made in @entity236			0
she says : ' i look at it on a different level to @entity2			0
' i think that because we 're a lot older than the people in @entity2 , our lives are a lot more interesting and varied			1
' they 've got to a certain point where there 's only so much that you can do , whereas most of us have been there , done that , had the boyfriends , got married , bought the dream house - they 've all got that still to come			0
' we 've done that and are on to the next chapter			0
' so i think we 've got huge scope			0
' it has also got a few more bricks in each house and a few more bits of bling on each finger , so it ups it			0
' it makes it more appealing to the eye and everyone wants a slice			0
' @entity26 regularly attends glitzy red carpet parties in @entity34 @entity26 enjoys a champagne - fuelled lifestyle one person who certainly does n't want a slice is @entity26 's father @entity270 , who is horrified at his daughter 's decision to take part in a reality show			1
she says : ' my father is utterly disgusted			0
i do n't have a close relationship with my mum , i 've not seen her for years , so it 's just my dad and he is utterly disgusted and ashamed of the fact that i 'd want to put my life on display to the public and get hurled abuse at			1
' so he might not want to watch it , but i 'm sure i 'll have lots of other followers			0
' and one thing she is keen to introduce her followers to is some outrageous @entity34 style			0
she says : ' @entity34 is chintzy and vibrant - big shoulder pads , big hair , lots of hairspray			0
' we 're in your face			0
' down south they are a lot more reserved , a lot more classical and chicer			0
' they look at the formation of a silhouette as opposed to being embedded in crystals and heavily jeweled , which i tend to go for			0
' @entity26 with her fellow @entity307 at the launch of the tv show earlier this week but although she has a different style to most southerners , one woman she makes sure to single out for some praise is the @entity314			1
she says : ' i have got a lot of respect for @entity314 's style - i think that she is classically very beautiful			0
' i like a lot of her choices , like the colours , the detail and the simplicity of everything - she looks like an elegant lady and i very proud that she represents our country as the @entity314			0
' but , she would be even sexier if she went through my underwear wardrobe and got some sexy @entity328 on and i tell you what @entity330 , you could conquer the world ! '			0
