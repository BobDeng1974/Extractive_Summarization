the work of @entity1 is certainly not for the squeamish			2
her @entity3 posts of severed fingers , rotting flesh and impaled limbs may seem like the work of an extremely violent ( or extremely clumsy ) person but @entity1 's injuries are , in fact , all a clever illusion			1
@entity1 , 26 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , works as a special effects make - up artist with the daily challenge of trying to find ways of slicing off fingers and impaling bodies in a completely pain - free way			1
in one picture , her toes appear to have been chopped off , while in another , a bloody ear has teeth marks where skin should be and in another , her forearm is covered in a huge iron ' burn '			0
one of her most inventive is a zombie rictus grin which she made by building up layers of toilet paper , latex and fake blood on her face			0
however , @entity1 's talents stretch beyond mangled makeovers having worked in theatre and helped out on film sets and she says that her work can involve beautifying rather than horrifying a client			0
she told movie pilot : ' i am constantly building up my portfolio as a make - up artist			2
it includes what i like to call , ' pretty make up ' such as bridal and special occasions , but more importantly from blushing bride to bleeding eyes i specialise specifically in special effects creation of realistic wounds , injuries and traumas			1
' @entity1 's gory recreations of wounds have earned her a loyal following of almost 3000 on @entity3 @entity1 says that she was inspired to go into stage make - up by her family who worked in showbiz as well as her gory recreations @entity1 works as a general make - up artist for weddings and events yet while @entity1 's love of re-creating serious injuries may seem ghoulish , the make - up expert 's interest is informed by her unusual background growing up in a theatrical family			1
her grandparents owned a circus , her father was a real life cowboy , stuntman and prop maker and her mother started out as a stylish stage hypnotherapist and went on to become the first female escapologist			0
@entity1 watched her father transform himself into different characters and she studied her mother while she applied stage make - up			1
now her gory @entity3 profile with its uncanny depictions of horror scenarios and hideous household accidents has attracted almost 3,000 followers as users take note for possible pranks or @entity103 inspiration			1
@entity1 titled this post ' day - dreaming nightmare ' as she replicates a finger being severed by a potato peeler @entity1 says that she used to watch her mother apply stage make - up as a child @entity1 says that her busiest time of year is @entity103 ... unsurprisingly and yet @entity1 admits that some horror films terrify her			1
she tells movie pilot that even though she finds the @entity115 films ' hard to stomach ' , the special effects are incredible			2
she said : ' i â€™d have loved to have been in on those early planning sessions			0
the make - up team must have been in their element and i can only imagine how fun and rewarding working on such a film was , now something like that is where i want to be ! ' so far she has put her skills to good use creating realistic injuries from a derailed train simulation to for an emergency service training exercise			2
in fact , she watches gruesome flicks for inspiration rather than thrills			0
' horror films do inspire me , and now when i watch them i zoom in on how the make - up was created instead of just what it is , ' she said			1
and everyday life provides plenty of fuel for her over-active imagination			0
' i look at everyday objects and think of the bad things that could happen , ' she said			0
@entity1 often incorporates kitchen props to replicate household accidents @entity1 uses prosthetics to create convincing injuries such as these severed toes			0
