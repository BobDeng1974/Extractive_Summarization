by @entity0 the first ever gold coin to be struck in the @entity2 more than 225 years ago is expected to fetch at least $ 5 million at auction			1
the gold doubloon was struck in 1787 and was the fledgling country 's first ever coin intended for circulation in @entity2 's emerging colonies			2
prior to its launch , settlers used foreign copper and silver coins they had brought with them or coins they had forged themselves			0
but only a handful of the gold doubloons were ever made and just seven exist worldwide today.the coin is estimated to sell for at least $ 5million when it goes under the hammer			1
going under the hammer : this gold doubloon struck in 1787 is expected to sell for five million at auction but experts believe it could fetch far more , beating the $ 7.6 million dollars paid for a $ 20 coin from 1933 called a @entity28 , making it the second most expensive coin in the world			1
it could potentially even rival the $ 10 million world record set in january 2013 by the sale of a 1794 one dollar coin			1
the gold doubloon contains 26.66 grams of gold - slightly less than an ounce - and was worth $ 16 at the time , around $ 400 today			1
it was struck by @entity41 goldsmith @entity40 , a neighbour to @entity42 , and is being auctioned on behalf of coin expert @entity43 who bought it in 1979 for $ 430,000			1
on one side it features the @entity47 of the @entity2 - an eagle holding an olive branch in its talons - and the motto ' e pluribus unum ' meaning ' out of many , one '			0
on the reverse is a sunrise over a mountain with the words ' @entity57 excelsior '			0
@entity57 was an early name for the @entity2 , @entity57 is @entity60 for @entity41 and excelsior - ' even higher ' - was its motto			2
worth more than its weight in gold : the coin contains 26.66 grams of gold which was worth $ 16 when it was made but is now worth $ 400 @entity68 , an expert in currency from @entity70 , said : ' @entity71 is a wonderful piece with an incredible history			1
' it is one of the most famous coins in existence and among the most valuable too			0
' what makes it so special is that it was the first gold coin ever to be struck in the @entity2			2
' at the time the coins used by the fledgling colonies were either foreign ones they had brought with them or copper and silver coins they produced themselves			0
' there were no gold coins and that was something @entity92 wanted to rectify			0
top dollar : a @entity94 , believed to have been the first silver dollar struck by the @entity96 , sold for slightly more than $ 10 million at a @entity41 auction last january ' @entity40 , a goldsmith in @entity41 and a neighbour of @entity42 , produced a small number of gold coins called doubloons worth 16 dollars face value			1
' only seven now survive , two of which are in museums , and of the remaining five this one is the finest example - it is like new			0
' the seller is a prominent coin dealer who bought the doubloon the last time it came up for sale in 1979 and has treasured it ever since			2
' it will be many years before a coin like this comes up for sale again and we expect the auction to be a momentous event			0
