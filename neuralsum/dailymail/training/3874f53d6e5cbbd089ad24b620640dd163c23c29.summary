by @entity0 published : 13:58 est , 10 october 2012 updated : 14:02 est , 10 october 2012 a family is fighting a bitter war over the £ 4million fortune of a ‘ selfish ’ property and restaurant tycoon who was said to have used prostitutes and once threw a dog off a cliff in front of his weeping relatives @entity12 , of @entity13 , @entity14 , died aged 81 in 2007 - a year after his wife @entity15 - and his sister @entity16 , 90 , has been at war with his niece and nephew ever since over the money			1
he was ‘ a selfish , demanding , controlling man , who could explode with demonstrations of extreme cruelty ’ as well as a ‘ philanderer ’ who used prostitutes , his niece @entity21 told a court			0
previous win : if @entity12 's 1980 will was valid on his death , then his nephew @entity30 ( left ) and niece @entity31 ( right ) will inherit his wealth in @entity34 , valued at £ 1.8million after payment of inheritance tax @entity38 to the dispute are two wills he signed in 1980 and 1994 – the first in @entity34 and the other in @entity42 , his birth country			1
if the latter will replaced the earlier , mrs @entity16 will inherit all his global assets			1
however , if the 1980 will was valid on his death , then his niece and nephew , @entity31 and @entity30 , will inherit all his wealth in @entity34 , valued at £ 1.8million after payment of inheritance tax			1
@entity21 , of @entity50 , west @entity51 , and @entity30 , of @entity52 , north - west @entity51 , last year won a @entity54 debate , but mrs @entity16 - their aunt - now wants the @entity56 to reverse that decision			1
this would effectively disinherit the @entity60 duo			0
mrs @entity16 insisted that her brother never thought of himself as @entity62 , despite moving to this country to make his fortune in the 1950s			1
she added that he continued to speak the native dialect of @entity66 fluently and had intended his @entity42 will to revoke his @entity34 one			2
her barrister @entity69 argued he may have forgotten about his older @entity34 will and , had he remembered it , would have wanted it ‘ obliterated ’ with his niece and nephew ’s inheritance rights			2
battle : @entity21 , of @entity50 , west @entity51 , and @entity30 , of @entity52 , north - west @entity51 , last year won a @entity54 debate , but @entity16 - their aunt - now wants the @entity56 ( pictured ) to reverse that decision during the trial of the case , ms @entity21 told the court of his character : ‘ it was well known by the family including ( his wife ) @entity15 that @entity12 went with prostitutes and that he was a philanderer			1
‘ throughout my life @entity12 always behaved like a big spoilt kid			2
if he did n’t get his way he would sulk terribly and his mood would darken so much it was almost unbearable			0
' it was well known by the family including ( his wife ) @entity15 that @entity12 went with prostitutes and that he was a philanderer			2
throughout my life @entity12 always behaved like a big spoilt kid ' @entity21 , @entity12 's niece ‘ i recall one evening he was sulking about something			2
he grabbed the small dog that used to come to the kitchen step of the family holiday villa in @entity42 for scraps			0
‘ i remember seeing him pick up the dog , throwing it into a black bin liner then throwing it into the boot of his car			0
‘ then with full knowledge that my mother , aunt , @entity30 and i were watching horrified from the balcony , he drove down the drive to the end of the twisting road and he threw the bag over the cliff edge			0
i remember my mother and my aunt crying because of what he had done			0
' she continued : ‘ despite his deplorable and totally abhorrent behaviour , and his hateful character , @entity15 and @entity12 loved each other and i believe one could not live without the other			0
@entity12 often spoke of his home being wherever my aunt was			0
my aunt always viewed @entity34 as her home			0
' i remember seeing him pick up the dog , throwing it into a black bin liner then throwing it into the boot of his car			0
then he drove down the drive to the end of the twisting road and he threw the bag over the cliff edge ' ms @entity21 ‘ @entity12 always referred to @entity34 as his home and never spoke of wanting to live in @entity42 ... i know from what he said that @entity12 considered himself @entity62			1
’ mr @entity135 ruled last year that @entity34 , not @entity42 , law applied to the case because mr @entity12 , despite his @entity42 roots , ‘ regarded @entity34 as his home and considered himself to be @entity62 ’			1
‘ i have reached the conclusion that the 1994 will did not wholly revoke the 1980 will , ’ he concluded			0
' the material part of the 1980 will , which leaves the @entity34 estate of the deceased to his niece and nephew , continues to be valid and must now be carried into effect			1
’ @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 have now reserved their judgment at the @entity56 on mrs @entity16 ’s case against that ruling and will give their decision at a later date .			1

@entity42 @entity12 , of @entity13 , @entity14 , died aged 81 in 2007
his sister @entity16 , 90 , has been at war with his niece and nephew
the duo , @entity31 and @entity30 , won a @entity54 battle last year
dispute *centres* over @entity34 will he signed in 1980 and @entity42 will in 1994
if latter will replaced earlier will , mrs @entity16 can inherit all his global assets
but if 1980 will was valid , @entity31 and @entity30 will inherit @entity34 wealth
