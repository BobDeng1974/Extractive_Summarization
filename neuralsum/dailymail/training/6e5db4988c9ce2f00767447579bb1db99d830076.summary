by @entity0 published : 18:15 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 14:08 est , 13 march 2014 beaming in the spring sunshine on a rare day out without @entity4 , a radiant @entity2 was the picture of maternal joy			1
seven weeks after she became a mum , there was no sign of the dreaded snap - back — the worrying trend in which celebrities shed their baby weight the second they leave the delivery suite			1
nor has she succumbed to the pressure to stay indoors , away from prying eyes , until all signs of her pregnancy have been sweated off in the gym			2
as pictures of her enjoying herself at @entity24 races this week prove , @entity2 is clearly taking a sensible approach to losing her baby weight			1
she is not showing off the flat tummy , model-esque legs or toned arms boasted by so many other post-partum celebrities , but , in short , she looks just like any other new mother			2
a day at the races : @entity2 chose an empire - line coat and opaque tights in her favourite colours for a day out at @entity24 , after giving birth 7 weeks and 4 days ago hurrah for @entity2 ! but while i wholeheartedly congratulate her for embracing her new figure , with its magnificent bosom and gently rounded stomach , i certainly ca n’t applaud her fashion choices			1
she ’s often been criticised in the past , and again , here , the proportions are all wrong			2
the tiny hat only serves to make her seem bigger than she is			2
the empire - line cream coat drapes down from her new fuller bust , making her look a little like a ship in full sail , while the fussy horizontal bows and the high neckline do nothing to flatter her lovely new curves			2
and while endlessly fashionable , those clumpy shoe - boots do n’t make the most of her excellent legs			2
never known for her fashion sense , it seems @entity2 has made the classic mistake of jumping into her pre-baby style before her body has had a chance to ping back			1
in the months after giving birth most women develop a strange kind of body dysmorphia — you ’ve been huge for months , so as your bump deflates you suddenly feel svelte again			1
overnight , getting dressed seems more appealing ; after an eternity wearing your husband ’s jogging bottoms and hideous maternity tents , perhaps it ’s time to get your pre-baby look back ? any mother will remember that moment — it ’s incredibly exciting			2
so exciting , in fact , that it ’s all too easy to overlook the signs that you ’re not quite back to your old self just yet			0
i recall one favourite jumpsuit that i could n’t wait to wear after the birth of my son @entity86 , now six			2
three months after he was born i got one leg in , then another			0
i stuffed my arms into the sleeves and even managed to zip it up			0
i was so delighted by this fact that i even went out in it , only to catch sight of myself in a mirror which showed up the straining fabric across my midriff			0
and this is the issue ; your body changes after a baby and you have to change the way you dress to suit it			1
it ’s not about covering up , as @entity2 has done with her empire - line coat , it ’s about accentuating your good bits and skimming the bits that need a bit more time			1
dressing needs more thought , and a bit of a revamp			0
@entity2 has worn a uniform of cream , knee - length coat , black tights and boots to @entity24 every year for the past decade			1
but while it might have worked beautifully on her pre-baby body , it is not the best shape on the other side of the motherhood divide			0
the raised waist of the empire line cuts across her impressive embonpoint , making her silhouette much rounder than necessary			0
an empire line should tuck just under your bra - line , emphasizing your amazing assets and adding definition to your shape ; without that your chest and tummy merge , adding weight where there really is n’t any to hide			2
' all things considered , the most important thing for a new mother is comfort			0
' reaching for roomier clothes is a habit that many mothers fall into			0
the logic , which , again , i know so well , is that if you embrace baggy , no - one will notice that your waist has gone on an extended holiday			0
sorry , but actually you need clothes to fit properly			0
and this is something that the other young royal mum , the @entity153 , seems well aware of			0
when the ever - chic @entity153 was photographed looking fabulous just seven weeks after giving birth to @entity155 , she plumped for a dazzling floor - length gown which skimmed her frame			1
while comparisons of @entity153 ’s post-baby body and @entity2 ’s are unfair — they were completely different to start with — @entity2 could have opted for a longer , more fitted frock like @entity153 ’s to break up her silhouette			1
if you ’re not sure of your shape , stick with wider necklines , which are much more slimming , and go for a print to break up your body			0
and while @entity2 has wonderful legs , the black opaque tights are too harsh and unladylike against the pale coat			1
sleeves are a major issue for new mums too ; go loose and you add unwelcome volume , but too tight like @entity2 and we ’re back to the problem with my jumpsuit — flesh straining against the fabric			1
accessories are the fun bit — they always fit — and i can imagine @entity2 ’s glee at ditching the nappy bag for a clutch			1
the key is to keep things in proportion			0
big accessories make you look smaller , but that hat looks like it would fit @entity4			0
shoes , too , can be problematic , especially as your feet are still prone to swelling			0
@entity2 opted for a shoe - boot shape with a stiletto heel that she may be cursing after a long day at the races			1
all things considered , the most important thing for a new mother is comfort			0
new mums need to feel comfortable in their roles , in their new wardrobes , and in themselves			0
but ultimately , the best accessory for every new mum is a huge smile and @entity2 ’s got that spot on			1
