by @entity0 published : 08:07 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 04:19 est , 6 december 2012 @entity2 car manufacturer has sparked criticism with its new estate car that , with a top speed of 189mph , is as fast as a @entity7			1
with its huge amount of boot space and plush interior , the new @entity9 estate car looks best suited for a family getaway			1
but if the kids drive you round the bend , its 4 - litre v8 engine means you can make a quick getaway of your own in what is believed to be the world 's fastest estate car			1
by comparison , a @entity33 gets to 62mph in 3.8 seconds and a @entity27 takes 4.1 seconds			1
it is the latest model from @entity9 which has made a series of superfast estate cars			2
but road safety charity @entity38 criticised the company saying there is no need for a family car to be able to drive so fast			1
spokesperson @entity44 said : ' there is never a need for a family car to be able to reach speeds of 190mph , or even 100mph			1
' while fast cars can be enticing , going fast should only ever be encouraged on race tracks			2
' speed is a factor in all road deaths and injury , as the faster you go , the harder you hit			2
' driving above speed limits , or too fast for conditions , is plain dangerous and causes many deaths and catastrophic injuries on roads every year			0
' that ’s why @entity38 urges all drivers to drive under speed limits at all times , and go even slower when conditions call for it such as outside schools and homes or in bad weather ; to do otherwise is inviting disaster			0
' a spokesperson for @entity9 said : ' there are numerous cars capable of exceeding @entity75 national speed limits but all @entity2 cars are designed to cope with the de-restricted sections of @entity78			0
' many of our customers appreciate the safety and stability designed into these cars which are , in effect , over-engineered for @entity86			0
' four - wheel - drive and other advanced items like large brakes make cars like the @entity9 safer than smaller less powerful cars at @entity75 speeds and this adds to the appeal of our more highly engineered models '			2
brute force : the @entity9 has a 4 litre v8 engine which is also used by the @entity98 roomy : the @entity9 still has space for five passengers and luggage in the boot despite the 4 litre v8 engine the v8 engine is also used in the @entity98 - popular with @entity106 footballers - and powers an eight - speed gearbox			1
the standard model will be limited to 155mph but this can be removed to give it a top speed of 174mph			0
0 - 60mph : 3.9 seconds @entity113 : 189mph engine : 4 - litre @entity115 efficiency : 28mpg cost : between £ 75,000 to £ 80,000 but owners wanting to go even faster can opt for the top - end ‘ @entity120 ’ model which will hit a staggering 189mph			1
@entity9 's team of engineers performed 5,000 test miles at the @entity125 race track before signing it off for production			0
and despite its performance , @entity9 claims the @entity9 is capable of 28mpg which makes it 40 per cent more efficient than its predecessor			0
it is expected to cost between £ 75,000 to £ 80,000 when it goes on sale next year			0
the firm , based in @entity132 , @entity2 , had its best year in 2011 - selling 1.3 million cars worldwide with 113,703 models sold in the @entity75 .			0

faster than a @entity27 and can do 0 - 60mph in just *3.9seconds*
family estate still has room for five *people* and luggage space in the boot
road safety charity says no car should be able to drive so fast
