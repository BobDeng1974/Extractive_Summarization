by @entity0 and @entity1 dreadful loss : schoolboy @entity3 , who died during the devastating floods in february the parents of a seven - year - old boy said to have died due to a faulty pump used at their home during the winter floods , claim he was really killed by deadly cyanide gas leaking from a landfill site			1
new evidence has emerged that toxic hydrogen cyanide may have leached from a lake at the back of the home where schoolboy @entity3 tragically died during the heaviest flooding to hit @entity20 in 248 years			1
his grief - stricken parents now fear there has been a cover - up , as police continue to insist @entity3 died from carbon monoxide poisoning from a petrol - driven pump at their riverside home , even though the @entity30 insist they did not use it			1
meanwhile , @entity33 officials and environmental experts have uncovered evidence of hydrogen cyanide at the riverside property in @entity37 , @entity38 , which still remains sealed off six months after the tragedy			1
scientists have told @entity41 that the deadly gas – used in the @entity44 death camps – could have come from the former landfill site that stands just 20 yards from the back of the family ’s home , as the rising water table could have pushed cyanide gas up through the landfill soil , generating hydrogen cyanide			1
as floodwater clogged the basement , gas bubbles could have risen up into the house with tragic consequences			2
the family were rushed to hospital in the early hours of february 8 , after a call from @entity3 ’s mother @entity59 , 37 , who had found both @entity3 and his father @entity60 , 48 , unconscious			1
@entity3 was pronounced dead on arrival , while medical tests confirmed there were traces of hydrogen cyanide in his parents ’ blood			2
@entity60 , a company director , has been left paralysed from the waist down and still attends almost daily hospital appointments			1
a consultant neurophysiologist has confirmed his medical condition is caused by exposure to hydrogen cyanide			0
firefighters evacuated the area after their personal alarms were triggered by the presence of the gas			2
a total of 17 people were rushed to hospital and checked for signs of poisoning , but the only casualties were @entity3 and his parents			2
later the same day , teams from @entity33 ( @entity86 ) and the @entity87 descended , scouring the flood - hit area in biological suits			0
@entity33 has confirmed hydrogen cyanide was present			0
the couple have been advised not to return home – even to collect belongings or precious photos of their only child			0
yet authorities are now accused of refusing to investigate the landfill site			1
meanwhile , @entity3 ’s parents are still waiting for a date to be set for their son ’s inquest – despite new rules that mean inquests should be completed within six months of a death , unless there are good reasons for a delay			2
more than 10,000 people have signed a petition demanding ‘ a national debate ’ on the risk of toxic gas leaching from landfills during floods , as @entity3 ’s parents claim they face a ‘ wall of silence ’ from the authorities			1
speaking to @entity41 , @entity60 said : ‘ it ’s been six months since @entity3 ’s death and people are still at risk			1
it ’s obvious there are powers that do n’t want this to come out			0
’ a million tonnes of hydrogen cyanide are still produced globally each year , and it is used in many industrial processes from paper - making to electroplating metal			0
regulations around its disposal are tight , but that has not always been the case			0
according to @entity148 , further tests have found the cause of death to be ‘ carbon monoxide poisoning ’			1
yet @entity60 and @entity59 insist there was no possible source of carbon monoxide in their all - electric house			1
@entity60 said : ‘ how can they say our son died from a substance that was not in our house , yet not look at the substance we now know was and has left me maimed ? ’ questions : @entity59 and @entity60 , who is now paralysed from the waist down and confined to a wheelchair @entity148 released a public statement on @entity3 ’s cause of death less than 24 hours after 800 local residents attended a heated public meeting on the floods , during which suspicions were raised about whether hydrogen cyanide was responsible			1
‘ the area was landfill from the 1940s until the 1970s , ’ said @entity60			2
‘ @entity59 and i now can not live in our own home because of the gas activity that ’s been found there			2
we ca n’t even go to get our belongings			0
it is heartbreaking that we are now six months down the line and still have not got to the truth			0
’ but @entity185 insists the former gravel pit site was filled in with building rubble rather than industrial waste before being converted into a lake and field , although some residents claim the area was known as ‘ the dump ’ for decades			0
a joint statement from @entity197 and @entity185 said : ‘ @entity198 is not a landfill site in the usual sense , it is a former quarry restored as a landscaped lake			1
‘ the landfill referred to is rubble used in constructing its banks			0
’ but @entity60 said that @entity33 ( @entity86 ) wrote to him in may , warning him that as traces of the toxic gas had been found in the house , they should not return home			1
@entity33 would not comment other than to say : ‘ we have not identified any evidence suggesting there is a public health risk , or hazard to neighbouring properties			0
’ last night experts called for a full investigation into the tragedy			0
‘ questions need to be answered , ’ said @entity217 , a leading environmental hydrogeochemist with 25 years ’ expertise			0
‘ almost anything can come up from a landfill site going back to the 1940s			1
the problem with older sites is we do n’t really know what ’s gone in there			0
’ @entity228 , chair of @entity230 ’s land quality committee , said : ‘ there are landfill sites that have taken large amounts of industrial waste , including cyanide , in the past , and it ’s a possibility that dangerous material could be mobilised if the landfill site was n’t particularly water - tight			1
’ how it happened : the tragic events that led up to @entity3 's death ... and how his parents found ' the truth ' neighbour @entity244 , 44 , a finance broker , told @entity41 that he was told he may have 15 minutes to live when firefighters knocked on his door at 5am on the night @entity3 died			1
he was among the 17 neighbours taken to hospital as a precaution by emergency service			0
he recalled : ‘ we were woken up at an ungodly hour			0
two firemen came and said , “ @entity3 has passed away and @entity60 and @entity59 are in hospital			1
” i was told by both the fire brigade and the police that it was hydrogen cyanide			0
the fireman said death happens quite quickly , and that if it was in our blood we had got 15 minutes			0
‘ i do n’t see how they can say carbon monoxide killed @entity3			1
the only thing that could have caused carbon monoxide poisoning is the petrol - driven pump and i know they did n’t use it because i would have heard it			1
’ a spokesman for the @entity87 said it would not comment while police inquiries were continuing , referring all questions to @entity148			0
a police spokesman said : ‘ there ’s no evidence of any wider risk to members of the public			0
’ asked if there was any indication of hydrogen cyanide either at the property or in @entity3 ’s blood , the police spokesman replied : ‘ i ca n’t comment on any of the medical testing as that was done externally and by independent experts			2
' we go by whatever information is put to us and the result is that the cause of death was carbon monoxide poisoning			1
we ca n’t comment on [ whether the pump had been used or not ] as that ’s part of the investigation			0
’ the ex-landfill site is owned by gravel company @entity300			0
last night , a statement from the firm said : ‘ while to date we have no reason to believe there is any link between this site and the awful tragedy that has befallen the @entity3 family , we have made it clear that we will give complete cooperation to any authorities wishing to investigate the background to this incident			2
’ meanwhile , @entity60 and @entity59 continue to fight for answers			2
@entity60 said : ‘ @entity3 spent his short life helping others , now @entity3 needs some help			1
we can not replace @entity3			2
but can try to protect others			0
if we can find answers for @entity3 , we can protect others			2
