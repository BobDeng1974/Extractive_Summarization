by @entity1 reporter whether placenta facials , vajazzling or fish pedicures , recent years have seen bizarre beauty treatments become the norm			2
but , as @entity7 has revealed , toe - curling beauty treatments are n't as modern as most of us think			2
from @entity12 's toxic lead make - up to poisonous eye drops made from deadly nightshade , historic beauty treatments were just as bizarre as their modern equivalents			2
but what 's in the compact ? @entity18 's @entity17 most were also considerably more gruesome , among them a painful - sounding method for lengthening the lashes championed in an 1899 edition of @entity23			0
under the headline irresistible eyes may be had by transplanting @entity27 , the piece explains how longer eyelashes can be achieved by having hair from the head sewn into the eyelids			1
the article concludes : ' eyebrows are doctored in the same way , but there is not so much pain associated with the process as there is in transplanting eyelashes			0
' if that 's not enough to leave you feeling ready to go bare - faced , a particularly dangerous method of removing excess hair might do the trick			1
within a year of @entity47 's discovery of the x-ray in 1895 , doctors and dermatologists were using them to treat everything from excess hair to acne			1
but while the treatment did indeed remove hair , getting rid of it required as much as 20 hours under the x-ray , which led to everything from burns to cancer			1
dangerous : a vintage ad for dr @entity61 's @entity60 and @entity63 's @entity62 not clever : x-rays were used as a treatment for excess body hair while mercury was thought to cure spots although the side effects of prolonged exposure to x-rays were noted in a 1909 report , it was n't until 1920 that the consequences were fully understood			1
and x-rays were n't the only radioactive beauty treat embraced by women in the late @entity79 period and early 20th century			1
@entity80 itself was used as an ingredient in expensive skincare , with one 1915 ad , for a company called @entity87 's range of rouge , night cream and skin soap , reading : ' an ever - flowing @entity91 has at last been found in the @entity92			1
' when scientists discovered @entity80 they hardly dreamed they had unearthed a revolutionary " @entity95			1
" ' they know it now			0
@entity97 vitalize and energize all living tissue			0
' but while it took time for the deadly results of radium and x-rays to be revealed , other popular ingredients for beauty potions took effect more quickly			1
poison : like arsenic and mercury , @entity107 leaves could be deadly but were once used in eye drops lead : the @entity112 portrait of @entity12 highlights her pale complexion created using lead make - up particularly dangerous was arsenic , a fast acting poison used by @entity79 women to achieve pale , perfect skin			1
unfortunately for those who used it , it achieved the effect by killing off red blood cells and also made users go bald			0
although those who used readymade potions such as dr @entity130 ’s @entity129 were n't immune , those who attempted to make their own by soaking the arsenic off fly paper tended to feel the ill - effects more quickly			1
unlike arsenic , there was no @entity135 way to create face cream based on mercury , although that did n't stop hundreds of thousands of women from being poisoned by lotions made from it			2
before safer cures for spots were invented , the dangerous substance was used to cure acne - and syphillis - despite the fact that mercury is easily absorbed through the skin and causes birth defects , kidney and liver problems , fatigue , irritability , tremors and depression			1
and that was n't all			0
hair pomade made from rodent - attracting lard and make - up that contained lead remained big business until well into the 20th century			2
so will future generations remember modern treatments as bizarre and deadly ? with traces of mercury and lead still found in some products , and poisonous formaldehyde used in keratin blow - drys , it seems likely			0
an ordinary fine needle is threaded with a long hair , generally taken from the head of the person to be operated upon			2
the lower border of the eyelid is then thoroughly cleaned , and in order that the process may be as painless as possible rubbed with a solution of cocaine			0
the operator then by a few skilful touches runs his needle through the extreme edges of the eyelid between the epidermis and the lower border of the cartilage of the tragus			0
the needle passes in and out along the edge of the lid leaving its hair thread in loops of carefully graduated @entity197 this has been done another length of hair is sewed through the lid until finally there are a dozen or more loops projecting			2
by this time the effect of the cocaine has been lost , and the operator is obliged to desist , and put off further “ sewing of hair ” for another @entity209 next step in the process is cutting off and trimming the ends of the loops , and the result is a fine , thick , long set of eyelashes			1
it is the finishing touch , that is to come , that makes them look like nature ’s own			0
when they are at first cut they stick out in the most singular fashion , giving the person operated upon the most uncanny look			0
the operator ’s next step is to take curling tongs , made of silver , and no larger than knitting needles , and to give them the curve which is essential to perfect beauty			0
then the eyes are carefully bandaged , and kept so until the following day			0

@entity79 eyelash extensions involved sewing hair onto the eyelids
@entity242 and arsenic were once popular *additions* to skin creams
