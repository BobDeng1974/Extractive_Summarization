by @entity0 published : 07:23 est , 8 february 2013 updated : 08:21 est , 8 february 2013 this is the deadly six - inch gap on a 125mph railway line in @entity3 that was not repaired until two weeks after it was first discovered			1
the broken rail was on the @entity7 near @entity8 , @entity9 , and had ' crumbled away to nothing ' causing a ' risk to life ' , experts have said			1
last friday the damaged stretch at @entity14 was shut for five hours and nine trains were cancelled as engineers finally stepped in			2
astonishing : this is the picture that will shock every train passenger , showing a gap of six inches of railway ' crumbled away to nothing ' on the @entity7 near @entity8 , @entity9 just as worryingly there have been several other dangerous incidents on the same line in the past five months			1
experts say it could have led to another @entity29 disaster , where four died after a @entity30 to @entity32 train was derailed by ' critical cracks ' in 2000			0
this picture has has sparked a major investigation , and is a ' mirror image ' of another gap found on the line just before @entity38			1
the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) - the national rail safety watchdog - said today it was investigating a ' number of rail breaks ' on the line , which runs from @entity30 to @entity43			2
these include a broken rail spotted by the pubic in @entity47 last september and a 10cm gap seen by a train driver near @entity50 last november			1
the latest incident , near @entity8 , was spotted by on track teams and the section of track eventually replaced			0
fast : the @entity7 runs from @entity30 to @entity43 with train regularly hitting 125mph on the route ( file picture ) but @entity61 's @entity60 union said the fault ' raises serious questions about the impact of wear and tear on rail infrastructure			1
' ' this shocking new picture highlights the reality on @entity3 â€™s railways today - staffing , inspections and track renewals have been cut in the dash to save money and there is massive pressure right from the top of government to keep services running at all costs regardless of the potential human cost , ' he said			0
' we had trains thundering over this section of rail between @entity30 and the north at speeds of up to 125 mph			2
' a train could easily have been derailed and even crashed into another coming the other way with loss of life			0
' a @entity96 ( @entity95 ) spokesman confirmed the ' dip ' , as they called it , was found on january 17 , but the track was not replaced until last saturday february 2			0
' a dip in our track was identified and spotted at @entity104 on 17 january , ' a spokesman said			0
' following our well - tried and tested industry procedure to remedy such dips , we scheduled an intervention to repair this dip on the saturday night of 2 february			0
' unfortunately , the track deteriorated more quickly than is to be expected and , on discovering the broken rail , all traffic was stopped immediately while a repair was carried out			2

@entity7 *mainline* rail was finally *changed* on friday after ' crumbling away '
it is one of several incidents on 125mph route in past five months
broken line *previously* found in @entity47 and 10cm gap near @entity50
