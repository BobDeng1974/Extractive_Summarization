@entity0 is determined to carry on with the aggressive approach that has seen him become a key figure at the top of @entity6 ’s order and has vowed to go ‘ hard ’ at @entity7 when cricket ’s old enemies resume hostilities on friday			1
if anyone epitomises the brand of cricket @entity6 will need to produce if they are to catch up with the pioneers of the one - day world then it is @entity0 , who is determined to take his fearless approach all the way to the @entity20			1
@entity0 has been the best of the six openers @entity6 have used in 50 - over cricket in the year leading up to the premier one - day tournament and has made it clear that if he is to go down at this @entity20 then it will be fighting			1
@entity0 appeared in good spirits as he was put through his paces during a net session in @entity29 the 27 - year - old has a strike rate of 109 in the 12 50 - over matches he has played so far for @entity6 ‘ it ’s the only way i can play in one - day cricket , ’ said @entity0 , who made a 38 - ball 50 in @entity6 ’s opening tour match here in @entity29			1
‘ sometimes i face 30 balls and i feel as though i ’ve had 50 or 60 already			1
‘ it ’s natural for me to be aggressive and is the sort of thing i ’ve done for a few years now			2
i feel it ’s the best way for me to play and if i ’ve got any doubts in the middle i just tell myself to keep on going hard and not go into a little shell			0
’ that means he will not be put off by the odd ugly dismissal , such as the first ball duck with which he ended the one - day tour of @entity48			2
‘ it ’s not nice getting out first ball but i ’d prefer to go having a slog than just blocking it , ’ he said			0
the promotion of @entity0 , 27 , as an opener has been one of the few recent successes for @entity6 as they continue playing catch - up in one - day cricket			1
moeen in action at the crease during @entity6 's match against an @entity63 team at the @entity64 @entity0 touches gloves with @entity66 who he is likely to open with for @entity6 rather than @entity67 he has a strike - rate of 109 in the 12 50 - over matches he has played so far and made a brilliant 119 off 87 balls in @entity70 to prove that he just as important to @entity6 in white - ball cricket as in the test game			1
but he insists there is more to come , ideally starting in wednesday ’s match against a prime minister ’s xi and then the tri-series against @entity7 and @entity78 here that precedes the @entity20			1
‘ i definitely feel i can get better , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s been one year of international cricket for me now and i feel like i ’ve got better already so hopefully i can improve more			0
i do feel like i ’ve got a lot more to show			0
it ’s early days and there will be some tougher tests , like @entity7 , and that will be a real challenge			1
’ @entity6 meet the team that humiliated them this time last year in @entity91 in friday and in @entity92 next week before the much - anticipated @entity20 opener between the sides in @entity95 on february 14			1
@entity0 , in action on monday , hopes he and @entity66 will forge a strong opening partnership for @entity6 @entity98 holds nothing back as he bowls to @entity100 during @entity6 's warm - up match ‘ each match now is a chance to show we ’ve taken a step forward as a team and that we have intent and will come harder at @entity7 than perhaps we have done previously , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ we just need to focus on what we need to do			0
‘ the standard of the opposition in our first game was n’t as good as it will be but we showed we can be ruthless			0
that can only be a good thing			0
’ the sacking of @entity115 provided @entity6 with a chance to show that they will throw off their shackles here but they have only gone so far and it now seems certain @entity66 rather than @entity67 will open with @entity0			1
‘ when i started at @entity121 was there and i enjoy batting with him , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he ’s quite busy , he ’s good at getting singles as well as boundary shots and is a classy player			0
hopefully we will be a good combination			0
@entity129 , celebrating a wicket against @entity78 , will miss the opener against @entity6 through injury ‘ i think out styles complement each other			2
we ’ve both got to bat our way			0
if he gets a hundred ball hundred that for him is the way to go			0
he should just bat the way he does and not worry about being too aggressive and hopefully i can take a bit of pressure off him at the other end and make it easier for him			0
’ the pair ’s task will be made easier , at least on friday , by the absence of @entity129 , who misses the first match of the tri-series with a sore hamstring			2
but @entity0 insisted he is ready for the man who destroyed @entity6 in the @entity152			1
‘ i ’m not too fussed who bowls to be honest , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’ll face him at some stage probably			2
he ’s a world - class bowler who ’s got so much respect and i ’ve never faced anyone like that so we will see what happens but i feel like i ’m ready to face anybody			2
’ if he can succeed against @entity129 on @entity162 then @entity0 really will have arrived as a formidable international performer .			2

@entity6 will face @entity7 on friday ahead of next month 's @entity20
@entity0 has established himself as one of @entity6 's best openers
he has a strike rate of 109 in the 12 50 - over matches he has played so far
@entity6 also to face a prime minister 's xi on wednesday prior to tri-series
