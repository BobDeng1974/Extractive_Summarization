by @entity0 @entity1 : 13:19 est , 30 december 2013 @entity2 : 17:43 est , 30 december 2013 @entity3 means something quite different for @entity6 coaches on the first day following the end of the regular season			1
five coaches have already been fired today in a tradition known as @entity11 , as teams not progressing to the playoffs try to get a head start on next year			1
as of noon today , the head coaches of the the @entity20 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , and @entity18 have all been let go			1
if any more firings are announced today , it may be one of the worst black mondays in recent history			1
last year was noted as being an especially brutal year with six firings			0
as monday morning dawned , two other coaches expected to be fired joined @entity38 on the unemployment line			0
the @entity17 fired head coach @entity30 and the @entity16 fired head coach and executive vice president @entity31 in announcements made before 10am			1
@entity31 was among those expected to be out of the job for the way he dealt with quarterback @entity48 's acl injury last season			0
@entity48 injured his right knee in a game against the @entity52 on december 9 , 2012			0
surprising : by noon today @entity53 of the @entity15 ( left ) and @entity54 of the @entity20 ( right ) were also let go			1
@entity53 's dismissal was unexpected since an @entity6 insider previously tweeted that his job was safe instead of letting @entity48 recover from the injury , @entity31 put him back on the field after missing just one game			2
on january 6 , the @entity16 went up against the @entity61 in an @entity6 wildcard game and @entity48 aggravated the injury , having to undergo surgery three days later			2
@entity48 was back playing this season but the leg injury seems to have slowed him down noticeably			0
by lunchtime , two other coaches had been fired : @entity53 of the @entity15 and @entity54 of the @entity20			2
bad move : @entity16 head coach @entity31 was expected to lose his job for the way he dealt with quarterback @entity48 's leg injury			2
above , @entity48 aggravated his injury in a game against the @entity61 last year @entity53 's firing was unexpected as @entity6 insider @entity75 tweeted yesterday that the @entity15 coach was safe			1
@entity15 general manager @entity77 was also let go			0
out early : the @entity78 broke tradition and fired head coach @entity80 earlier this month , before the end of the regular season while five firings may seem relatively tame , the dismissals have impacts far beyond one man since it means their assistant coaches are also out of the job			1
but most wo n't be unemployed for long as they 'll get snapped up by one of the other now head coach-less teams			0
this quick turnover process helps the struggling teams get a fresh start on next year before the combine and draft			1
' everyone ’s in such a competitive environment , there ’s a race to get things done because there is the same group of candidates out there , ' former @entity107 general manager @entity106 told the @entity108			0
' it ’s to clear the decks and move on			0
' while it 's not certain when @entity11 officially became apart of the @entity6 culture , the @entity108 reports that it originated about 10 to 15 years ago around the time when sports channels switched to become 24 hour news sources			1
but not all teams take part in the annual ritual			0
the @entity78 fired their head coach @entity80 at the beginning of this month far before the end of the regular season			2
' we normally would wait until the end of year to evaluate our staff ; under these extreme circumstances thought best to start the process now , ' team owner @entity121 said at the time .			0

every year , struggling teams announce their firings the first day following the regular season to get a head start on next year
so far today , the head coaches of the @entity20 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 have all been let go
if more are announced today , it may be on track to surpass last year 's noticeably harsh six firings
@entity11 has been a part of @entity6 culture for the past 10 or 15 years
