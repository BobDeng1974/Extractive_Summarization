@entity0 has said he will only take part in one election debate @entity0 could be given his own election programme if he refuses to show up for televised leaders debates , it was claimed today			1
broadcasters last week insisted they would push ahead with plans for three debates in april â€“ including a face - off between the prime minister and @entity11			1
but the @entity12 is understood to have backed down from threats to ' empty chair ' mr @entity0 if he refuses to show			1
if the corporation pushes ahead with its planned @entity17 debate without the prime minister it risks being accused of giving an unprecedented platform to the @entity21 leader , just a week before the election			1
to meet strict impartiality rules during election campaigns , the @entity12 is considering giving mr @entity0 his own show in return , the @entity23 on sunday claimed today			1
@entity21 have accused the prime minister of ' ducking and weaving ' to get out of the debates and called for new laws to make sure leaders debates always take place			1
@entity11 said he would make ' fair and impartial leaders ' debates ' compulsory			2
but the proposal was mocked by the former @entity40 leader @entity39 today			0
mr @entity39 said he supported having tv debates but added : ' could you actually pass a law which says that somebody has to turn up at a tv debate ? ' what do you do when @entity0 does n't turn up ? shall we stick him in the clink , do we put him in @entity49 [ prison ] or somewhere ? ' ' i do n't think you can actually do that			0
surely it 's the public who have got to enforce the tv debates by the reaction to people who are too scared to turn up			0
' @entity21 said the new system would work on similar lines to the current rules for planning the number , length and timing of party political broadcasts			2
that would mean parties are consulted but not given the right to veto the debates taking place			0
@entity11 has accused @entity0 of ' running scared ' of facing him in televised leaders ' debates @entity21 believes this could be done by establishing the @entity74 as a trust in statute so it is the recognised legal body for deciding dates , format , volume and attendees of the debates			2
a @entity21 government would set a deadline of 2017 for changes to be put in place , giving more than enough time to plan the debates for a 2020 election			1
mr @entity11 told @entity90 : ' in recent days the @entity92 public has been treated to the unedifying and tawdry spectacle of a prime minister seeking to duck out of the tv debates he once claimed to support with great enthusiasm			1
' he said the broadcasters had ' made it clear they would not be cowed by his tactics but it is wrong for them and the @entity92 public to have governing parties use this kind of pressure in campaign periods '			0
mr @entity11 added : ' it is time to ensure , once and for all , that these debates belong to the people , not the prime minister of the day			1
' the four broadcasters - the @entity12 , @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 - have said they will stick to their previously - announced plans for three debates during the election campaign , and urged the prime minister to ' reconsider ' his refusal to take part in these shows , including a head - to - head showdown with mr @entity11			1
education secretary @entity123 ( left ) said the broadcasters had made a ' mess ' of the election debates , but @entity127 accused @entity0 of trying to scupper them mr @entity0 , @entity129 and @entity130 faced off in tv debates ahead of the 2010 general election but mr @entity0 's chief spin doctor @entity133 said their response was ' disappointing ' and restated the prime minister 's ' final position ' was for a single debate to take place in the week starting march 23			1
the broadcasters said they would stick to plans for a seven - way debate involving mr @entity0 , mr @entity11 , @entity129 of the @entity143 and the leaders of the @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity40 and @entity147 on @entity111 on april 2 , followed by a second show on @entity12 featuring the same line - up on april 16			1
a final one - on - one clash with the @entity152 and @entity21 leaders invited is scheduled to be broadcast on @entity153 and @entity113 on april 30 - exactly a week before the may 7 election			1
in a letter to mr @entity133 , the broadcasters made clear they were ready to go ahead with the debates even if mr @entity0 decides not to take part			2
@entity158 's director of communications @entity133 has rejected the broadcasters ' ultimatum education secretary @entity123 today accused the broadcasters of making a ' real hash ' of trying to organise the debates			2
she said : ' the prime minister has made a very clear offer			1
a 90 - minute debate involving everybody the week of march 23			0
' so we get to the short campaign ... we can get out into the country			0
' asked on @entity153 ' @entity173 specifically about a head to head between mr @entity11 and mr @entity0 , she replied : ' they are up against each other pretty well every week at prime minister 's questions			2
' frankly i think the broadcasters have made a real hash of this because the processes and discussions have been going on for months and months now			0
' they invited this party and that party			0
the prime minister has made a very clear offer - get seven parties in the same place , have a 90 - minute debate before the campaign starts			1
' otherwise all we are doing all the way through the campaign itself is talking about the debates			0
' i think actually we ought to be ... getting out of @entity200 , getting out of the tv studios ... talking to people on the campaign trail			0
' but deputy labour leader @entity127 said there should be a legal framework underpinning the tv debates as there is in relation to pre-election broadcasts and election spending			0
she told @entity211 : ' i think the debates are an important part of our democracy , in which case let 's not have the prime minister of the day ducking and weaving because he is afraid of actually justifying his record			1
' let 's have a legal framework set out and then we wo n't have this all over again next time round			0
' the bottom line is - it is not too late for @entity0 to actually say ... i think if somebody is saying i want to be prime minister , i want to be in @entity231 , but by the way i 'm not going to go out there and debate it , it 's not acceptable			2
' he should have the guts to go out there and say , this is what i have done since i have been prime minister and this is what i want to do next			2
' the fact he wo n't do that shows that he is not prepared to justify what he has done over the last few years			0
' all he seems to be doing is talking up other parties in fact			0
' our democracy is important , more important than any one particular party			0
it is about people in this country being able to see what they are voting for			0
' millions of people , more women than men , but lots of men as well , do n't vote because they do n't think politicians are straight with them , they are not prepared to level with them and i 'm afraid the prime minister is proving himself a classic example of that			2

broadcasters have insisted they will push ahead with three debates
prime minister has said he will only take part in one seven - way *contest*
@entity12 is understood to have backed down from threats to ' empty chair ' him
but to meet strict impartiality rules it could offer the *pm* his own show
comes as @entity21 *unveils* plan to make election debates compulsory
leaders would not be forced to attend but debates would always go ahead
