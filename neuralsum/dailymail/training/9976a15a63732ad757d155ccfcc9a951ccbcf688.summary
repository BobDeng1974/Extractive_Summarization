' @entity2 courts originally said the 1978 @entity40 — a federal law intended to keep @entity4 children from being taken from their homes and typically placed with @entity45 adoptive or foster parents — favored her living with her biological father , @entity20			1
a member of the @entity51 , @entity20 had never met his daughter and , after the girl 's @entity45 mother rebuffed his marriage proposal , played no role during the pregnancy and paid no child support after the girl was born			2

but the @entity76 — who were present at the girl 's birth and even cut her umbilical cord raised @entity16 for the first 27 months of her life — appealed that decision to the @entity8 @entity7			1
last month , the nation 's high court ruled that @entity2 courts should decide who gets to adopt the girl , a determination the state court made yesterday			2

' there is no mention , or apparent consideration , in the majority decision of the child 's best interest , as the dissenters point out			0
' separately , justices @entity122 and @entity124 wrote that , while the case 's details should be hammered out in @entity17 , the transfer of the girl should be handled delicately so as to be least disruptive to her			0
' the majority orders the immediate transfer of the child , no longer an infant or toddler , upon the filing of the family court 's adoption order , without regard to whether such an abrupt transfer would be in the child 's best interest , ' the two justices wrote			0
' this is a situation where the decisions that are in the best interests of this child , given all that has happened in her short life , must be sorted out in the lower court ( s )			0
' any parties that want the court to rehear the case have five days to make that request			0
