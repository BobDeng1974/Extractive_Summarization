the earliest surviving portrait of @entity1 in @entity2			1
archaeologists are hoping to find his grave under a council car park in @entity6			0
archaeologists today moved a step closer to finding the remains of @entity1 they confirmed they have found the @entity10 friary where he is believed to be buried in the most unlikely of settings - under a council car park in @entity6			1
they have found medieval window tracery , glazed floor tile fragments , part of what may be the @entity10 cloisters walk and a section of wall			1
the team has so far excavated two 30 - metre trenches in the @entity25 car park which is believed to cover the @entity10 site where @entity1 was taken after meeting his end at the @entity28			1
the team believe that the church is the most likely location for a monarch ’s burial place – and the next step will be to dig another trench with the aim of intersecting the church itself			1
@entity39 , co-director of the @entity40 , said : ' today , what we are saying is that we have found the @entity10 and have uncovered tantalising clues as to the location of the church			1
' it has gone about as well as we could hope for			0
' @entity39 of the @entity40 with part of the medieval friary the team hopes will lead them to the body of @entity1 ' we aim to dig a contingency trench over the weekend to see if these walls are the church			1
' if this is the case we can point to the area where @entity1 might have been buried			2
' @entity56 , of the @entity1 society , said : ' we are in the right area			2
' we have started to get a sense of where @entity1 ’s body may have been brought			2
' i did not think we would be where we are now at the start of the dig. a selection of medieval building materials found at the @entity10 site in @entity6 ' i am totally thrilled			1
' for me , the whole dig is now coming to life			0
' the dig is being filmed for a forthcoming @entity72 documentary to be aired later this year			0
the researchers believe @entity1 was buried in a @entity75 friary in the area after being killed by the army of @entity78 during the @entity28 in 1485			1
the friary was , however , knocked down during @entity81 ’s dissolution of the monasteries , and the exact location of the burial site has been one of @entity87 ’s enduring historical mysteries ever since			1
last week , they began digging it up			0
@entity1 was @entity1 of @entity100 for two years , from 1483 until the @entity28			2
his death at the age of 32 marked the end of 30 years of civil war , known as the @entity105 , and the end of the middle ages			0
it also marked the dawn of the @entity78 dynasty and the demise of the @entity112			0
his clothes and armour were removed and his naked body carried on horseback to @entity6 , where the corpse was displayed in public for three days			0
he was then buried in the @entity75 friary , known as @entity10 , but just over 50 years later the church was destroyed			1
@entity39 holding a piece of mullion from a traceried window from the later medieval period at the archaeological site in @entity6 in a field behind @entity127 near @entity6 , the treeline marks the spot where @entity1 is believed to have been killed in battle			1
the 69p stamp featuring @entity1 born in 1452 , @entity1 was @entity1 of @entity100 for two years , from 1483 until his death in 1485 during the @entity28			2
according to another tale , @entity1 consulted a seer in @entity6 before the battle who foretold that ' where your spur should strike on the ride into battle , your head shall be broken on the return '			2
on the ride into battle his spur struck the bridge stone of the @entity145 ; legend has it that , as his corpse was being carried from the battle over the back of a horse , his head struck the same stone and was broken @entity153 was the last @entity100 king to be killed in battle he was the last king of the @entity156 and the last of the @entity112 dynasty			0
although @entity1 has gone down in history as a monstrous tyrant with a hunchback and a withered arm , most historians now claim such an image is purely fictitious and down largely to how he was portrayed by @entity165			2
legend says the body was removed and cast into the @entity168 , but historians hope to prove wrong this disputed version of events by finding it at the council site			0
the archaeologists , from @entity175 , along with members of the @entity177 , hope finding the remains will help to change the way the monarch is viewed historically			1
@entity1 is traditionally seen as a tyrant who murdered his way to the throne , disfigured by a hunchback and a withered arm			2
many historians , however , claim that a distorted image of the king was deliberately created by the @entity189 , the most notorious example of which is @entity165 ’s play about him			0
the @entity177 said it hoped the excavation , which is projected to last two weeks , would end ‘ the enormous disparagement ’ of his reputation			0
the site of the friary was bought by @entity198 @entity197 , the mayor of @entity6 , in 1612 , after the church was demolished in 1538			2
he built a mansion there			0
in 1914 , @entity202 bought the land , later turning it into a car park			0
archaeologists will start by digging two long trenches across the car park , hoping to find remains of the church and narrow down the search			2
they will also use ground - penetrating radar to find the best places to dig. @entity39 , co-director of the @entity214 at the university , said : ‘ it is quite a long shot but it ’s a very exciting project			0
we do n’t know precisely where the body would have been buried but we suspect it would be in the choir or near the altar			0
’ if bones are found they will be assessed for trauma to the skeleton			0
@entity1 was hacked down after being surrounded and one historical account suggests that the blow which finally felled him was so hard that fragments of his helmet were left in his skull			1
they will also be subjected to dna analysis			1
the remains will be matched against the @entity232 of @entity234 , a 16th generation descendant of @entity235 , the sister of @entity1 mrs @entity234 died four years ago , aged 82			1
at the site yesterday , mrs @entity234 ’s son @entity236 , 55 , watched as the search began			0
the furniture - maker , who was born in @entity241 but now lives in @entity242 , said his mother would have been thrilled by the project			0
‘ the family were entertained when she got the call several years ago from a historian claiming she was a descendant , ’ he added			0
the @entity248 , medieval silver - gilt livery badge of @entity1 , helped researchers pinpoint the location of the battle of @entity28 when is was found in east @entity252 in 1999 archaeologist dr @entity253 shows today how the badge of the boar led them to pinpoint the battlefield and where the king fell			1
' this is almost certainly from a knight in @entity1 's retinue , who rode with him to his death on that last charge , ' he said a flag and memorial stone mark @entity267 , just northwest of @entity268 memorial : the plaque at the place where @entity1 is believed to have been killed a depiction of the carnage during the @entity28 by 18th century painter @entity273 ( 1740 - 1812 ) the @entity28 was fought on the morning of august 22 , 1485 , and marked the end of the @entity105 , the 30 - year civil war between the houses of @entity156 and @entity277			1
one of the most important clashes in @entity100 history , it saw the death of @entity1 , ushered in the @entity78 dynasty and gave @entity165 one of his best known quotations			2
the leading role has been played by @entity286 and sir @entity287 , and the battle has also been immortalised in many artworks			0
the battle marked the final confrontation between the @entity156 king @entity1 and his challenger @entity78 , @entity294 and @entity295			2
the seeds of @entity1 's downfall were sown when he seized the throne from his 12 - year - old nephew @entity299 in 1483			1
support for the monarch was further diminished when @entity299 and his younger brother disappeared and @entity1 was involved in the death of his wife			1
@entity78 laid claim to the throne from across the @entity72			0
following an unsuccessful attempt to invade @entity100 from his base in @entity308 , @entity78 arrived on the coast of @entity310 on august 1 , 1485			0
gathering support as he marched inland , @entity1 hurriedly mustered troops and intercepted @entity78 's army south of @entity314 in @entity315			1
after @entity1 's death on the battlefield his rival was crowned @entity78 and became the first @entity100 monarch of the @entity78 dynasty , which lasted until 1603 .			1

team say dig is ' *exceeding* *expectations* ' , and now plan to look for the monarch 's burial site
archaeologists have identified the *franciscan* friary known as @entity10 from window and tile fragments
if remains are found , they will undergo dna analysis at the @entity40 to confirm that they are those of @entity1
