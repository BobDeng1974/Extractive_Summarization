@entity0 received a phone call after arriving in @entity2 on sunday which brought home to him how times have changed since he eased out retirement a year ago – in @entity6 , of all places			1
the iconic @entity9 lock is enjoying a new lease of life in @entity13 rugby , after ending his playing career in 2011 , only to subsequently have a change of heart			2
on saturday , he will face @entity16 in the @entity18 series at @entity19 , having become @entity9 ’s most - capped player – which seemed a distant prospect when he was making a guest appearance on the veterans ’ circuit			1
twelve months ago , 37 - year - old @entity0 was having fun in the sun – helping his country win the @entity28 in @entity6 , via victory against the @entity30 in the final			1
it was all part of the grand plan to return to the elite level of the game			2
that was the first , tentative step in the process			2
@entity9 lock @entity0 retired in 2011 , only to have a change of heart ‘ i went to @entity6 at the end of last year , ’ he told @entity40 on monday			1
‘ by then i actually knew that i was going to play again so i almost felt like i would go there and see if my body was feeling right for it			2
i had been mountain - biking quite a bit so i had gone down to 99kg and i was skinny ! ‘ i went over and it was much slower , but it was pretty physical because most of the boys are 10 - 15kgs heavier than they should be ! so the collisions were still really tough and it was just good to get back into it , see how my body felt and it felt alright			1
‘ what was nice was that i was the only guy there who was really in shape			2
all the other guys would have stints of about 20 minutes and come off , but i would play every minute of every game			2
there were a couple of beers after each game – and before each game too ! @entity0 will face @entity16 in the @entity18 series at @entity19 on saturday @entity9 may look to parachute @entity65 in at fly - half to face @entity16 at @entity19 on saturday ahead of fast - rising star @entity67			1
meanwhile , @entity9 attack coordinator and forwards coach @entity68 has singled out @entity16 ’s scrum - half as one of their chief threats : ‘ @entity19 is a place we love to play			1
we ’re facing world - class players ; we ’ve a lot of respect for @entity77			1
’ ‘ we won the tournament , which made it even better			0
i got a call from the guys at the airport yesterday – the @entity84 boys who were on their way there for this year ’s tournament			1
they were missing me ! ’ while those former @entity9 are once again enjoying the laid - back charms of the @entity6 tournament , @entity0 finds himself back at the sharp end of his profession – ready for a fifth personal appearance at @entity19			1
he had finished playing in 2011 and did some tv punditry , as well as coaching with his provincial team , the @entity95 - based @entity94			2
but , behind the scenes , he was being coaxed into a return by his long - term mentor , @entity99 , the former @entity94 and – briefly – @entity101 coach , who had taken charge of the @entity9 team after the last @entity104			1
‘ i always thought i would have loved to play under @entity99 in a @entity9 team , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ then i retired in 2011 and when i did , i did n’t know who was going to be the coach			0
when he got the job , the first call he made was to me , to ask me to come out of retirement			2
he wanted me to come back in , to captain the side as well			0
’ at first , he resisted @entity99 ’s advances , but eventually , @entity0 agreed to come out of retirement on the basis that he would play on until next year ’s @entity104			1
there were other former @entity94 coaches now working within the @entity9 ’ set - up and the renowned second row thought to himself : ‘ these guys can win the @entity104			1
’ he had misgivings though – fears even			0
‘ i was very happy retired and my wife was very happy as well , so it was something i had to discuss with her , ’ he said			0
‘ when i retired , that was a big part of it , thinking , “ i ’ve had my stint , it ’s time to get back to my family ” , so when @entity99 asked me , the biggest thing i had to be sure was that my family would be alright if i did this for another two years			0
‘ physically , fitness-wise , i always knew i would be fine			0
@entity136 , i was also confident because i was still involved with it , coaching the @entity94			0
i was going up against the guys and i found it pretty easy to win the lineouts against the current players , so i was happy with that			0
‘ but the physical contact was what i was scared of			0
being older and after being out of it for two years – i had gone down to 99kg and i normally played at about 108 , so i had to bulk up again			0
so i was definitely scared			0
‘ i also did n’t want to just come back , play two or three games and think , “ damn , i ’m not going to make it ” , not even make the @entity149 team and then just fade away			2
so there was a lot of pressure on me and i was a bit worried			0
’ veteran @entity0 is @entity9 ’s most - capped player after 117 appearances ultimately , @entity0 ’s concerns proved unfounded			1
once he had withstood the ferocity of a heavily scrutinised @entity94 comeback against @entity84 rivals the @entity160 in @entity161 early this year , he soon returned to the old routine and discovered that his body coped more effectively than it had done before his career hiatus			2
‘ i am definitely in much better nick than i was in 2011 , ’ he said			0
‘ i could n’t get up in the mornings and i could n’t walk down my stairs at home – i had to hold on			0
i think the two - year break helped my body a lot			1
before that , i was just buggered ! my body had seized up			0
’ once he was up to speed again , a path back into the @entity9 team opened up for him as other contenders in his position all succumbed to injury			0
‘ i was the only one left , ’ he joked			0
his return soon led to him surpassing @entity180 as his country ’s most - capped player and later in the @entity183 he was at the heart of @entity9 ’s first win over the @entity186 since 2011			2
when news of his comeback went public , @entity0 sensed a 50 - 50 split in media opinion at home			1
by the end of his first season back in the southern hemisphere ’ s showpiece @entity13 event , he had quelled any trace of resistance to his return			0
the sceptics had been silenced			0
@entity0 insists the @entity200 will be his swansong being a @entity149 again has meant being reunited with his long - term lock accomplice , the arch enforcer – @entity203			1
@entity0 has savoured the reunion , both of them have ; enjoying the notion that they are defying the passing of time			1
‘ it ’s so funny , i knew i was going to come back last year and all of a sudden i saw that @entity203 was back in the squad for the end - of - year tour , ’ he said			1
‘ i could n’t believe it was real that the two of us were going to play together again			0
every time we get on the bus , we sit at the back there and @entity203 says to me , “ we ’re still here			0
they ca n’t get rid of us ! ”			0
’ yet , for @entity0 , the end is in sight , for a second and final time			1
whatever happens against @entity16 on saturday , on the rest of this tour and over the next 10 months , the @entity200 will be his swansong – no doubt at all			1
‘ @entity227 will be my last time playing , ’ he said			0
‘ i have already signed a two - year deal with the @entity94 for coaching			1
everything is in place and this time there definitely wo n’t be any comeback out of retirement			2
no chance ! ’ when that time comes , @entity0 will know what to do			1

@entity0 came out of retirement a year ago
he will make his 118th appearance against @entity16 on saturday
the 37 - year - old says he will hang up his boots after 2015 @entity104
