@entity0 took a commanding 3 - 1 lead back to west @entity2 after a strong showing in @entity4 to see off @entity6 's young side			1
@entity7 scored late on to put a gloss on the scoreline after a @entity10 double had seen @entity0 take a first half lead			1
@entity12 was at the @entity13 to see how the youngsters got on ... @entity10 smashes @entity0 into the lead with a fierce drive into the top corner @entity6 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity18 : @entity20 international has been on the bench for long periods but got the nod and looked shaky under the high ball			1
that said , powerless to stop @entity27 's volleys and @entity29 's killer			0
6.5 @entity30 : @entity33 - born former @entity32 youngster is not the tallest and at times struggled with @entity0 's diagonals early on but grew into the game and could have levelled			1
6.5 @entity37 : @entity4 lad and @entity41 youth international , @entity6 's captain was a commanding presence at the heart of defence			1
has the movement of @entity46 but put a big shift in			0
7 @entity48 goes up for the ball under pressure from @entity0 forwards during the @entity53 final @entity54 : has captained @entity41 and , like @entity37 had his hands full against a vibrant @entity0 attack but stood up to the test well			1
6.5 @entity58 : @entity60 left - back is not the tallest and was not able to drive forward as much as he would have liked against strong opposition			2
6 @entity63 : box - to - box midfielder from @entity66 , yards away from the @entity64 , pulled up injured after 36 minutes but battled back bravely but missed a glorious chance to tie things up			2
6.5 @entity6 midfielder @entity63 tracks the run of @entity7 as @entity6 looked to stem the tide @entity71 : moved to @entity4 from @entity75 as a toddler , the wide man who scored twice in the first leg of the @entity74 did outwitted @entity77 with a delightful tap and go but could not find the final , killer ball			1
blasted wide when should have levelled			0
6.5 @entity80 : @entity81 international @entity80 struggled to fill in for injured star @entity82 , seeing one shot from the edge of the area easily held by @entity86			1
6 @entity87 : joined @entity6 from @entity88 and the mini @entity90 showed some neat touches on the rare occasions he found space			2
was largely ineffective and should have done better when teed up by @entity94 late on			0
6 @entity95 gets a shot away , but it was blocked by @entity98 - @entity97 @entity99 : @entity101 centre forward produced measured finish to bring @entity6 level but was marshalled well for the majority of the evening			1
7 @entity94 : @entity6 's star man , the two - footed local lad is tipped for big things at the @entity108 but was perhaps guilty of trying to do too much at times here			1
did create a fine chance for @entity87 with a trademark surge and almost levelled late on			0
7.5 @entity6 's players celebrate after @entity99 ( left ) had levelled the game in the first half @entity0 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity86 : the @entity116 - born stopper could do little about @entity6 's opener and distributed the ball well			1
6.5 @entity119 : @entity120 born but eligible for @entity41 combined well with @entity97 to nullify @entity6 's threat in a commanding - looking partnership			1
7 @entity123 : @entity125 right - back found space time and time again down the right			0
@entity128 , strong and often influential			0
7 @entity129 : @entity125 18s international often too strong for @entity130 and , on the evidence of this sterling performance , is one to watch			0
7 @entity77 : under - 21 regular is still 16			0
fortunate to escape at least a caution with a from - behind challenge in the first half but was solid at the back and lively going forward , whipping in a number of decent crosses			1
7 @entity140 : @entity142 youth international covered his back four expertly and kickstarted a number of breaks as @entity145 pressed			0
6.5 @entity140 plays the ball out in an excellent performance protecting the back four @entity10 : two volleys for his 35th and 36th strikes of the season			2
big , bold and often brilliant , @entity0 will be hoping the injury that saw him substituted on 67 minutes is not serious			2
8 @entity155 : put in a captain 's shift in the centre of the park as the visitors won the midfield battle			0
is tipped for big things and showed just why			0
7.5 @entity27 makes it 2 - 1 at the @entity13 with an acrobatic finish past @entity48 @entity7 : scored for @entity41 in the @entity165 and put in a powerful shift here , teaming up well with @entity27 before effectively killing the tie with a neat third			1
7.5 @entity170 : the @entity172 playmaker , the only overseas man in the starting @entity173 , was quiet by his standards and drilled a decent chance tamely wide			0
6 @entity176 : said to be interesting @entity177 but will not want to dwell on his big moment early on when he blasted over bar when unmarked on the edge of the box			2
@entity182 aside , was a constant menace			0
substitutes : @entity185 ( @entity27 , 67 , 6 ) : on for @entity27 and showed explosive pace straight away but was let down by a hurried attempt at a finish which flew over the bar			0
@entity176 holds off a tackle from @entity119 , during another impressive display for the young forward			2

@entity0 forward @entity10 nets first - half double for @entity0
@entity7 adds a third late on as @entity0 look set to win trophy
@entity6 struggle without injured star @entity82
