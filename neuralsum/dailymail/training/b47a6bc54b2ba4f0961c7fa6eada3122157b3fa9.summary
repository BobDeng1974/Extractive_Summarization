@entity1 ’s dying wish was to see his son			2
that desire were the last words spoken by the first @entity6 victim to die on @entity8 soil			0
and it was a desperate hope he did not live to fulfill			0
this tragic revelation has been shared now by @entity13 senior pastor @entity12			1
@entity12 was speaking at a prayer service on wednesday evening - planned as a vigil of hope but transformed into one of remembrance by mr @entity1 ’s passing at 7.51 this morning			1
pastor @entity12 led prayers for the congregation that included community leaders and a small number of friends and family of mr @entity1			1
she remains in quarantine with her 13 - year - old son and two nephews followed the service			1
‘ if you are with us @entity54 , ’ pastor @entity12 said simply , ‘ we love you and we are praying for you			1
’ pastor @entity12 described mr @entity1 , 42 , as a man who had come to this country ‘ in hope			1
’ he said , ‘ he had dreams of a life			0
he had dreams for his son , @entity71 ( @entity56 ) ‘ the last words that ( @entity1 ) @entity1 said were said to a nurse			1
‘ she asked him what he wanted			0
he said he wanted to see his son			0
‘ she asked him where his son was			0
he said he was in college , where he should be			0
‘ he was very proud of his son			0
‘ his son , ’ pastor @entity12 added , ‘ wanted to see his father too			1
’ @entity79 @entity1 , 19 , a student at @entity80 , @entity32 , travelled to @entity81 yesterday in hopes of establishing a relationship with the father he last saw when he was just three years old			1
that was when his mother left @entity87 , and mr @entity1 , following a falling out and travelled to @entity8			1
but mr @entity1 ’s condition deteriorated so severely over the weekend that his family could only view him by video link			1
and even that was so upsetting to them , @entity56 said yesterday , that they could not sleep after seeing him and could not bear to see him again			0
ms @entity54 , who had been in telephone contact with the man who called her ‘ the love of his life ’ until friday			2
but by saturday , the day he began receiving experimental drug treatment , mr @entity1 was too weak to communicate with her			1
earlier today ms @entity54 issued a statement in which she told of her ‘ sorrow and anger ’ at mr @entity1 ’s death			1
already serious questions are being asked as to the standard of care the dead man received at @entity106			1
but tonight at the prayer service pastor @entity12 sought to place the focus firmly on he said , ‘ one man who we did not know a few weeks ago but who has affected our lives forever			1
’ over days of intense scrutiny anger has flared over mr @entity1 ’s ‘ eagerness ’ to enter the country			2
the allegation that he lied on exit documents in @entity87 by claiming he had not been exposed to @entity6 when he had carried a pregnant woman dying from the virus the day before flying has been much rehearsed			0
elegant service : pastor @entity12 sought to place the focus firmly on he said , ‘ one man who we did not know a few weeks ago but who has affected our lives forever ’ wrenching : the church in which @entity1 would have been married later this year instead ‘ sang him to heaven ’ but tonight pastor @entity12 revealed that mr @entity1 ’s greatest dream was to rekindle his family in @entity8 then return to the country of his birth , to ‘ build his country			1

’ according to pastor @entity12 who is in daily contact with the now grief - stricken woman , ms @entity54 told him , ‘ @entity71 wanted to come to this country			1
he wanted to be a family			0
he wanted to work hard			0
‘ he wanted to gain all he could so he could go back to @entity155 and build his country			0
’ mr @entity157 told pastor @entity12 that mr @entity1 was a ‘ @entity158 man ’ ‘ respectful of his father and mother			1
’ her recollection that he ‘ knew how to talk to ladies ’ provided a brief moment of levity as a ripple of recognition passed through those who were close to him			0
pastor @entity12 clarified , ‘ she said he did n’t let anyone use bad language in front of women			2
‘ he cared for his children and wanted the best for them			0
’ describing @entity6 as ‘ an unwelcome guest in our community , ’ pastor @entity12 urged the church that has provided spiritual and material support for ms @entity54 and the boys who must remain in quarantine until 19 october , ‘ to live by faith not fear			1
’ pastor @entity12 said , ‘ every day we make a choice about how we are going ot live			2
‘ are we going to move away from each other because of fear ? or towards each other because of love ? ’ earlier members of the @entity87 community – some 10,000 strong – and residents of @entity193 , the area in which the now notorious @entity195 in which mr @entity1 briefly stayed , spoke of the discrimination they had experienced in the wake of this @entity6 outbreak			1
@entity201 councillor @entity200 told @entity202 that yesterday morning alone 15 men had come to her telling her that they had been turned away from their jobs			0
she said , ‘ they were told not to come back for 21 days unless they had a note from the health department			0
’ tonight pastor @entity12 said , ‘ every day we make a choice about how we are going ot live			2
‘ are we going to move away from each other because of fear ? or towards each other because of love ? ’ ms @entity54 will not be able to say a final goodbye to mr @entity217 whose funeral will be held before her period of quarantine is over			2
earlier pastor @entity12 told reporters that his understanding was that the body would have to be cremated			2
he was unsure as to whether his ashes would be buried or placed in a sealed urn			0
associate pastor @entity226 said that it was likely there would be ‘ multiple memorial services , ’ for the man who pastor @entity12 said , ‘ we did not know a few weeks ago ( but who ) has affected our lives forever			1
’ last night the church that he would have been married in later this year instead ‘ sang him to heaven			0
