a woman went into labour early with her twins because she was laughing so hard at a @entity4 show			1
@entity5 and her husband @entity6 had been waiting for a year to the see the comedian at the @entity8			1
but the gig was cut short for them on tuesday night when @entity5 's waters broke when she was 30 weeks pregnant			1
surprise ! @entity5 and her husband @entity6 became parents seven weeks earlier than expected @entity5 , 29 , and @entity6 , 36 , from @entity14 , in @entity15 dashed off to the hospital and six hours later their sons @entity18 and @entity19 were born			1
@entity5 said she was still in shock over their early arrival			1
she said : ' we were sitting watching @entity4 and i honestly thought i had peed myself laughing - my bladder was n't as good as it normally is			1
' i turned to my husband and told him i was going to the toilet because i thought i 'd peed myself			1
' but when i stood up and was going to the bathroom i realised it was n't that			0
' @entity5 said she did not expect to go into labour half way through a @entity4 show			1
she added : ' i do n't know why but i thought it was going to happen in the house - you just do n't think it is going to happen anywhere else			2
' too funny : @entity5 's waters broke when she was laughing at stand up comic @entity4 missed the end of the show : @entity5 and @entity6 had to rush from a @entity4 gig to the maternity ward after she went into premature labour her husband was oblivious to the fact that his wife had gone into labour at the @entity8			1
but when she failed to return he quickly realised something was wrong			0
by this time a first aid team and a doctor were helping the mother - to - be and trying to make her as comfortable as possible			0
@entity6 said : ' when she did n't come back from the toilet i went to find her			2
' all i could see was the doctor and staff running about and it turned out she was in labour			0
' @entity6 drove @entity5 to @entity57 where the couple welcomed their twin boys seven weeks early			1
the support engineer said the couple were worried at the time because @entity5 was not expected to give birth so soon			2
early arrival : @entity18 ( he has a twin brother , @entity19 ) he added : ' it was quite worrying because we were only at 30 weeks but everything is okay now			2
they arrived at 2.30am weighing 3lbs each			0
' they are in the special care unit just now and will be there for four to five weeks			0
they are so small but are in a really good place , getting round - the - clock care			0
' the couple , who have been married since 2012 , conceived the babies through @entity80 treatment			0
they used one embryo egg which split so they know the boys will grow up as identical twins			0
@entity5 said the labour went well despite it being unexpected			2
and the training competence co-ordinator said it was great to have such a fantastic story to tell all her family and friends			0
she joked : ' people have been saying we should call them @entity4 and @entity94 , but i think we will stick to the names we have			1
