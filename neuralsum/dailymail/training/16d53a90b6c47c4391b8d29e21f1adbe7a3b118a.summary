over an eight month period between january and august 2011 he sought to illicitly obtain information on the arrests of two men on behalf of @entity18 as well as one of his associates			2
all four suspects were being watched by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a heroin and cocaine racket operating across @entity31 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58			0
they and 32 other men were later jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth £ 1.5million along with more than £ 200,000 in cash during a series of raids			0
secret : @entity6 , 42 , fed information to criminals because of fears his cocaine addiction would be exposed today at @entity71 , who worked at law firm @entity73 , based in @entity30 , was facing disgrace after being found guilty of two counts of perverting the course of justice following a three week trial at @entity71			1
he admitted cocaine possession at an earlier hearing			0

two detectives trailed the suspect and spotted him arriving at @entity6 ’s house in and was seen to place the drugs which had a purity of 60 per cent under the lawyer ’s bins in a black golf glove			1

' top brief ' for criminals : the court heard @entity6 was a ' regular user ' of cocaine after tests found traces of the @entity37 drug in his hair , wallet and on his credit cards @entity6 was arrested later but denied using cocaine and and said he had been speaking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and argued their discussions were subject to ' legal privilege			1
' during his arrest @entity6 picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken fom him			1
in a police interview he said he ran an office at his home address as well as work place and clients would call at his house on legal business			0
but the court heard he would call major players in the drugs supply chain , some of whom he had previously represented , after key arrests to tell them what detectives knew about them			0
@entity137 , @entity138 said : ' if anyone should know not to the break the law , it is a criminal solicitor			2
mr @entity6 is accused of abusing his position as a criminal solicitor , having become too involved with specific clients			1
office : @entity73 in @entity30 , @entity31 , where top defence lawyer @entity147 worked ' the relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer , but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer with drugs			2
' some of his communications will undoubtedly have been legitimate ones because he was their lawyer			0
but this went way beyond the ordinary confines of a lawyer - client relationship			2
' he thwarted the police ’s investigation as much as possible to enable them to continue in their criminal activities			0
mr @entity6 was not honouring his profession , but dishonouring it			1
' he got too close to certain clients , in particular @entity18 , and he allowed his independence to be compromised			0
' exposed : @entity6 , pictured outside @entity71 , was arrested in 2011 after a police surveillance operation into drug trafficking @entity6 denied wrongdoing and claimed : ' if i was a corrupt lawyer , which i am not , and i wanted to feed information to mr @entity22 , i would not wait 15 hours , i would do it immediately			1
' but after the hearing @entity178 from @entity179 said : ' mr @entity6 turned from criminal solicitor to a criminal himself the moment he started obtaining drugs from organised criminals			1
' his addiction to cocaine left him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the motives of leading members of organised crime groups who tasked him to obtain valuable information regarding police investigations			1
' solicitors should uphold the highest standards of integrity and should instil trust and confidence in the public			0
' mr @entity6 has betrayed this trust and attempted to hide behind the veneer of his profession			1
' @entity31 ’s @entity201 and @entity202 led the investigation into mr @entity6 which has also seen him convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and now perverting the course of justice , demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice ' let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law			2
we will find you and put you before the courts			0

on his website @entity6 gave a question and answer session about himself in which he says his fantasy job would be a lawyer representing clients on @entity236 in @entity237 , his ultimate dinner guest as being @entity239 and inequality as his motivation for work			2
on a website forum one client said of @entity6 : ' he ’s a top brief			2
if you get arrested and go to the desk to give your details , they ask you if you want a brief and if so which one			0
