by @entity0 published : 18:34 est , 16 september 2012 updated : 04:07 est , 17 september 2012 and so it came to pass that @entity2 and @entity3 finally came face to face at @entity6			1
as @entity9 and @entity11 ’s wedding loomed , the long - awaited encounters of the two grande dames did not disappoint			1
across the dinner table or in a church pew , they were like a pair of grizzled gunslingers , trading acid quips instead of bullets			1
not so painful perhaps , but almost as deadly			1
‘ oh dear , ’ cried @entity2 , pouncing on @entity19 ’s @entity3 in the hallway and gleefully eyeing up her wrinkles			1
‘ the war has made old women of us both			1
’ making an entrance : @entity26 as @entity2 in the third series of @entity6 , set in 1920 ‘ oh no , ’ @entity3 begged to differ			1
‘ i stay out of the sun. ’ in the delirious new series of @entity6 , which began last night , @entity2 ( @entity26 ) came crunching down the drive at last			1
she was wearing jazz shoes , what appeared to be a fur papoose and a frozen expression on her face			1
we ’d better get to like it — it ’s the only one she ’s got			1
as @entity45 ’s @entity44 mother , @entity2 ’s job is to patronise the @entity46 and their stuffy ways at every opportooonity			1
hey , someone has to show these squares that the egalitarian delights of the @entity53 , with its lack of pretence and stifling tradition , are the way forward			1
‘ tradition ! ’ she sneers regularly , in the finest showbiz tradition			1
she insists upon boiled water and goat ’s milk at all times , but i must say @entity26 ’s little dolly face seems slightly out of place amid the lush velvets and sprinkling of aristocratic @entity6 dust			1
did they even have @entity73 and crafty pearly highlighter in them days ? @entity75 also seems to be acting to a different beat , but maybe she gets her stage directions on a time loop straight from @entity79 himself ? who can say , but she is certainly a delicious target for @entity3 to be horrid about			1
aid : @entity83 , played by @entity84 , is seen helping @entity2 out of a vehicle in the sumptuous setting ‘ when i am with her , i am reminded of the virtues of the @entity46 , ’ she said			1
but @entity2 is n’t @entity46 , someone protested			1
‘ quite , ’ replied @entity3 , who later added that @entity2 is ‘ like a homing pigeon , she finds our underbelly every time ’			1
is that what homing pigeons do ? she was wearing jazz shoes , what appeared to be a fur papoose and a frozen expression on her face			1
we ’d better get to like it — it ’s the only one she ’s got meanwhile , hang onto your inheritance , kids , for there is trouble looming			1
we know the @entity110 is just a few years away , but @entity111 ’s in the soup already			1
he had to go up to @entity114 on the 2.30 train to see @entity116			1
this can only mean one thing			1
you see , the dopey @entity120 invested all of his wife ’s money in something called the @entity126 @entity125 — and it has only gorn off the rails ! ‘ are you really telling me all the money has gone ? the lion ’s share of @entity135 ’s fortune ? ’ he shouted , as @entity129 nodded sadly			1
inspecting her surroundings : @entity2 looks around as the the much - loved @entity6 characters return ‘ i refuse to be the failure , the @entity120 who dropped the torch and let the flame go out			1
i have a duty beyond saving my own skin , ’ he said , munching through the freshly steamed script like a hungry termite			2
you know , i ’m beginning to think that @entity135 might be a little mad			2
it ’s not just that simpering smile			2
maybe that slip on a bar of soap in series one damaged more than we ever knew ? back at @entity6 , when he told @entity135 the bad news , she admonished the silly sausage as if he had merely lost one of his socks , not her hard - inherited millions			1
you know , i ’m beginning to think that @entity135 might be a little mad			2
it ’s not just that simpering smile			2
maybe that slip on a bar of soap in series one damaged more than we ever knew ? still , the money might have gone but , amazingly , by some kind of well - i - never dramatic osmosis , the earl - in - waiting was thinking of downsizing anyway			2
it 's a pleasure : @entity2 ( l ) with @entity175 as @entity176 ( c ) and @entity177 as @entity9 ( r ) ‘ to be honest , ’ @entity11 told his valet , ‘ i want to live more simply after the wedding			2
’ that ’s lucky ! you know , sometimes the @entity183 plots are more realistic than the @entity6 ones , but no one really cares			1
it is all part of the joy			2
and speaking of lost luggage , here comes poor @entity189 ; the plain one , the sister without a mister			2
is she forever doomed to wander from drawing room to dining room being bright and brittle and single ? and that ’s not the only change with @entity11			2
why has the pale - eyed @entity6 dish started wearing too many clothes ? he is always trundling around in layers and layers of hats , coats , jackets , waistcoats ties , macs , and what have you			1
he is beginning to look like a packed suitcase			2
and speaking of lost luggage , here comes poor @entity189 ; the plain one , the sister without a mister			2
is she forever doomed to wander from drawing room to dining room being bright and brittle and single ? she has set her jaunty cap at family friend sir @entity219 , who appears to dance at the other end of the ballroom , if that knowing look at @entity224 the evil footman was anything to go by			2
still , it ’s not as if anyone was rubbing her face in it			2
fellow stars : @entity2 with actress @entity19 , who plays @entity3 , @entity3 of @entity45 ‘ weddings can be reminders of one ’s loneliness , ’ sir @entity219 told her , while @entity2 asked her tartly : ‘ still no one special ? ’ yes , hurrah			0
@entity236 the furiously @entity238 chauffeur is back and already in a pickle			0
inside his appropriately downtrodden @entity241 tweeds , he bristles like a very angry hedgehog it could have been worse ! she could have married the chauffeur and brought disgrace on the whole family			0

‘ please do n’t talk about @entity251 all the time , ’ begged his wife , @entity250			0
but are yew jokin ’ me ? he does n’t know when to stop			0
‘ we ’re in sight of throwing off the @entity46 yoke			0
the old me would want to put a bomb under the lot of ye , ’ he yabbers			0
line - up : @entity9 and @entity250 stand with @entity262 as @entity263 ( l - r ) in the show 's third series no wonder someone drugged his drink			0
i would have done it myself , had i been there			0
( by the way , the ruling classes back in the day treated their servants terribly , and were unutterable snobs			0
so it seems barely credible that an earl would allow a @entity236 back into his house , to his dining table , to sleep with his daughter under his roof			0
it would have been more realistic if he ’d had him horsewhipped			0
but let ’s not be picky			0
) it was a glorious opening episode , with lots of helpful reminders of what happened last time around to help the hard of understanding it was a glorious opening episode , with lots of helpful reminders of what happened last time around to help the hard of understanding			0
attention ! plot points alert			0
‘ may i remind you that in this house , mr @entity300 is still a wronged man , ’ said mr @entity293 , just in case you ’d forgotten one of the staff was in the clink for murder			0
meanwhile , @entity11 had to remind his really annoying mother about the family scandal			0
‘ an earl ’s daughter has run off with the chauffeur , ’ he noted			0
gentlemen : pictured are @entity307 as @entity120 , @entity308 , and @entity309 as mr @entity293 ( l - r ) as for the @entity120 himself , he was struggling to maintain a facade of bonhomie as the reality of his economic disaster came crashing in			0
‘ @entity318 , can i tempt you to one of these new cocktails ? ’ he said , waving a martini glass around in an at tempt to pretend everything was tickey - boo			0
it all ended with @entity9 walking down the aisle just about to marry her @entity11 , as @entity2 and @entity3 jostled together on the pews like two giant chaffinches			0
will the happy couple say i do ? they are going to keep us guessing until next week , although there were some tender scenes with @entity11 and @entity9 as they stumbled towards the altar like the lovestruck young fools they are will the happy couple say i do ? they are going to keep us guessing until next week , although there were some tender scenes with @entity11 and @entity9 as they stumbled towards the altar like the lovestruck young fools they are			0
‘ there are a lot of things i am looking forward to , ’ he told her , with a very fruity look			0
clearly , the old trouser tingle incident is nothing but a faint memory			0
still hovering in the background is a dodgy will , another inheritance , a giant footman , mrs @entity353 ’s treacle tarts and a blast from the past			0
roll on next sunday .			0
