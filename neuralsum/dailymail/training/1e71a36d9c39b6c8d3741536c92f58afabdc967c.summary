an extra £ 2.9 billion contribution to the @entity3 budget has delivered a blow to @entity6 's hopes of cutting the deficit , official figures revealed this morning			1
the deficit hit £ 13.1billion in december , up from £ 10.3billion a year before , the @entity8 said			1
the difference was entirely accounted for by the @entity13 's higher @entity12 contribution , recalculated because the economy was performing better than had been thought			1
borrowing for the april - to - december fiscal year to date is now £ 86.3 billion - just 0.1 % lower than in 2013/14 this will be partially made up for by a refund and rebate totalling £ 2billion , not likely to be recorded in the public finances until the next fiscal year			1
but it means borrowing for the april - to - december fiscal year to date is now , at £ 86.3 billion , just 0.1 per cent lower than in 2013/14			1
that compares with the independent @entity24 forecast of a 6 per cent fall in the annual deficit for the year to march			0
there was better news from income tax and capital gains tax receipts , which saw their best december performance in four years , climbing by 3.1 per cent to £ 12.6billion on the year			2
revenues from income tax have caused a headache in recent months as they have not been growing as much as expected despite the upturn in growth and record job numbers			0
the year - to - date borrowing figure was boosted by a £ 2.5billion downward revision , partly due to a £ 900million upward revision in income tax receipts so far in 2014/15			2
vat revenues for the year to date were also marked up , by £ 700million			0
underlying net debt was £ 1.483trillion - 80.9 % of gross domestic product , a record figure			2
@entity13 will receive a rebate from the @entity46 in the next financial year - totalling £ 2billion - helping the chancellor reduce the deficit a @entity50 spokesman said : ' today 's public sector finances show that the government 's long - term economic plan is working , with borrowing down so far this year and the deficit on track to have halved as a share of gdp			1
' but the job is not yet done and the risks in the global economy are growing so the only way to deliver economic security is to carry on working through our economic plan			0
' @entity65 , shadow chief secretary to the treasury , said : ' these figures show @entity6 has broken his promise to balance the books by this year and national debt is still rising			0
' his failure on the deficit is because falling living standards over the last five years have led to tax revenues falling short			0
this government is now set to have borrowed over £ 200 billion more than planned			0
' the @entity3 contribution of £ 2.9 billion was recorded for december to comply with accounting standards , though the cash will not leave the @entity13 until it is paid in the second half of this year			1
it will be offset by a refund estimated at £ 1.2 billion and an increase in the @entity13 rebate estimated at £ 800 million .			0

@entity13 made a £ *2.9billion* *payment* to @entity3 in december
the one - off contribution hit @entity6 's hopes of cutting the deficit
december shortfall hit £ 13.1billion , up from £ 10.3billion the year before
it means borrowing for fiscal year so far is just 0.1 % lower than in 2013/14
