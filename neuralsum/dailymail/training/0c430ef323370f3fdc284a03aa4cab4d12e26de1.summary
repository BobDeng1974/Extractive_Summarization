published : 10:31 est , 18 april 2014 updated : 12:08 est , 18 april 2014 if you 're a man dating a woman named @entity3 , @entity4 or @entity5 , then it might be time to start worrying			1
according to a new survey , those are the names most often given to women who pick their men for the size of their bank balance rather than for love			2
other names that indicate a preference for money rather than romance include @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
top of the list : women named @entity3 and @entity4 are most likely to pick cold hard cash over love 1			1
@entity28 rounding out the top 10 gold - digger names list , which was compiled by website @entity30 , are @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			1
@entity32 is an @entity34 website that lets users check potential partners for evidence of a criminal past or bizarre behaviour courtesy of its database of police records			0
the data behind the website 's choice of names is the result of more than two million background checks , which found women bearing those names are the most likely to be involved in petty crime			2
illegal ways of making money favoured by the world 's @entity55 , lisas and @entity52 include petty theft , property crime and vandalism			2
but it 's not just the ladies who have been on the receiving end of a less - than - flattering background check at the hands of the brains behind @entity32			0
according to the website , men named @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 are the most likely to have been caught committing petty crime , while the @entity34 state of @entity74 was found to have the highest number of people interested in checking their new partner 's background			0
exception : @entity80 is with @entity81 for love but not every @entity27 chooses the same suspect : women named @entity18 or @entity20 are also potential gold diggers according to @entity85 for those who do happen to be dating a @entity4 or a @entity3 , the site has this advice			1
' look out for a sense of entitlement and check whether they have trouble paying their bills			0
' gold diggers drop hints that they may be evicted or their car might be repossessed when instead they are buying $ 400 shoes and watches			0
' other warning signs , say the brains behind the site , include being more than 15 years younger , never paying for anything and having a penchant for expensive things .			0
