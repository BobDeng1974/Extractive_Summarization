by @entity0 under wraps : this is one of the @entity3 drawn up by the investigators the e-fits of a ‘ new ’ suspect for @entity8 ’s disappearance were drawn up five years ago – and suppressed			1
images of a man seen carrying a child through @entity12 at 10pm on the night the then three - year - old vanished were unveiled on @entity14 ’s @entity13 two weeks ago			1
they are based on evidence from @entity18 holidaymaker @entity17 and his family			1
at the same time , the @entity21 police team behind a new investigation revealed they had discounted a 9.15pm sighting of a man with a child by @entity26 , a friend holidaying with parents @entity27 and @entity29 and their three children			2
it meant there was a new ‘ timeline ’ of @entity35 ’s presumed abduction			2
yet it emerged yesterday that the recently released e-fits were in fact contained in files produced five years ago by private investigators hired by the @entity41			1
similarly , those private detectives had questioned the @entity44 sighting and the timings associated with it			0
but the @entity3 were kept private , and the questioning of the @entity44 sighting and related timeline were kept quiet			2
one detective said he was ‘ utterly stunned ’ to see his five - year - old dossier suddenly presented as new on tv			0
the investigator told a sunday newspaper : ‘ i was absolutely stunned when i watched the programme ... it most certainly was n’t a new timeline and it certainly is n’t a new revelation			0
it is absolute nonsense to suggest either of those things ... and those @entity3 you saw on @entity13 are ours			1
’ the @entity41 are now fully behind the fresh police drive and release of the @entity3 – but five years ago they were reluctant to issue them , possibly in part because witness mr @entity17 ’s account seemed inconsistent and unreliable			1
months after the disappearance and after seeing @entity70 on tv , mr @entity17 told police that he thought the man he saw carrying a girl around @entity35 ’s age at the very time she went missing reminded him of @entity70 himself			1
mr @entity17 has reportedly since withdrawn that claim – just as @entity78 police have officially told the @entity41 they are no longer suspects for their daughter ’s disappearance			1
the couple have also won libel damages for false suggestions that they were in any way involved			0
numerous witnesses have also given statements making clear that mr @entity70 was at his holiday complex at the moment the sighting occurred – which was at the very time when he and his wife started calling for help looking for @entity93			0
@entity8 went missing in @entity12 in may 2007 but shortly after mr @entity17 told police mr @entity70 may have been the man he had seen carrying a little girl , a friend of the @entity41 said : ‘ look at the facts			1
this man sees an individual carrying a child on the night @entity93 vanished			1
‘ he waits 13 days to report this to the police , going back to @entity18 in the meantime			2
at this stage he admits he has no idea who the man is			0
almost four months go by before , after seeing him on tv , he feels that it could be @entity27			0
‘ the truth is that this is part of the victimisation of @entity27 and @entity29 which has gone on from the very beginning by the @entity78			0
’ @entity78 police have officially told @entity29 and @entity70 they are no longer suspects for the disappearance in 2008 , the @entity41 used money from their charity fund to hire investigators from a firm called @entity118 , led by former @entity120 surveillance officer @entity119 , to look into the mystery – and they focused on the @entity17 sighting			1
they produced a dossier and called for the @entity3 to be published			2
they also suggested @entity35 could have died after wandering off			2
the @entity41 , who became embroiled in an unconnected financial dispute with @entity118 at around the time they received the dossier , responded by warning the detectives of legal action if they publicised their report			0
a source close to the fund said the report would have been ‘ completely distracting ’ if it had become public			0
porn star @entity134 played @entity135 - one of the @entity41 ' doctor friends - in the @entity13 appeal a porn star was employed by the @entity14 to appear in the reconstruction of @entity8 ’s disappearance , it has emerged			1
@entity134 , 45 , played @entity135 - one of the @entity41 ’ doctor friends - in the @entity13 appeal , watched by a show record of 6.7million			2
@entity134 , who says he has made previous appearances on the show , has starred in a host of crudely - titled porn films			0
but a spokesman for @entity149 criticised the @entity14 for hiring someone who has ‘ openly worked in the sex industry for something so sensitive ’			0
@entity154 mp @entity153 added : ‘ this is not the standard we expect from the @entity14			0
