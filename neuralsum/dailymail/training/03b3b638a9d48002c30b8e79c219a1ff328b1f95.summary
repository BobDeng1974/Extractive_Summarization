as prince @entity2 was having an early night yesterday to prepare for the launch of the @entity4 , his ex-girlfriend @entity0 was gallivanting around west @entity5 with her long - term love @entity7			1
the blonde lawyer 's relationship with the jeweler has been getting increasingly serious over the last few months , with rumours flying in recent weeks that an engagement announcement will soon be made			1
@entity0 , 28 , and @entity7 , 30 , spent the second half of august travelling through @entity14 , @entity15 , and @entity16 on a romantic adventure holiday together			1
but despite friends of the couple speculating that the mountain - top setting would be the perfect place for a marriage proposal , @entity0 's ring finger was noticeably bare of sparkle during their outing to the @entity20 and @entity21 launch party in @entity22 last night			1
it 's possible that the link to her ex 's older brother 's marriage proposal may have put @entity7 off asking for his girlfriend 's hand during their summer holiday			1
prince @entity46 asked @entity47 to be his wife during a trip they made to the spartan @entity51 during their @entity53 holiday in 2010			0
@entity0 and @entity7 arrived at the party fresh from their trip to @entity56 , where it was widely speculated the jeweler would propose but diamond ring or not , the couple looked blissfully happy as they arrived at the bash on the @entity63			1
they were n't the only royal connection in the building - @entity67 , who is in a relationship with the @entity47 's brother @entity69 was also in attendance			2
meanwhile , across @entity5 prince @entity2 was readying himself for a busy few days ahead of the @entity71 tonight at the @entity72			0
@entity0 looked radiantly happy at the event on the @entity63 , showing off the hand that was absent of an engagement ring the 29 - year - old has already admitted to being overwhelmed by the workload that came with hosting the @entity4 , which will see more than 400 war - wounded servicemen and women from 13 nations compete against each other			1
the six - day event is n't just sports - heavy ; @entity85 are appearing at the concert tonight to perform the official anthem and the @entity88 are doing a flypast , while the closing ceremony on september 14 will feature performances from @entity92 , the @entity93 and @entity94			0
the @entity4 started ahead yesterday , ahead of tonight 's @entity71 , with the prince attending a reception at the @entity97 , @entity98 alongside @entity94 front man @entity99			2
@entity0 and her boyfriend @entity7 both sported a healthy tan from their adventure holiday in @entity56 he said of his sleepless nights over the event 's success : ' of course i 'm nervous			1
‘ there are times when we thought that we ’re just never , ever going to get to the finish line			0
' if all the venues sell out , then i ’m happy because it ’s all about the atmosphere and making these guys feel really special			0

since splitting from his last serious girlfriend @entity122 in april of this year , @entity2 has only briefly been linked with a few women , including a pr executive called @entity125 at the @entity127 festival and @entity129 employee @entity128			0

the @entity2 has failed to find a similar long - term relationship since the end of their seven - year relationship but so far no one has matched up to his seven - year on - off relationship with @entity0 , who many referred to as the love of his life			2
the @entity146 was largely considered to be a match for the the @entity2 in both personality and temperament , with her strong will enabling her to cope with the attention that comes from dating one of the world 's most eligible bachelors			0
but the strict rules of living within the @entity157 monarchy eventually proved too much for @entity0			0
@entity122 was prince @entity2 's last attempt at a relationship for @entity2 , but the pair split in april after just over a year together according to friends , it was prince @entity46 's wedding to @entity47 in 2011 that proved to be the final nail in the coffin for @entity0 's relationship with @entity2 as she decided she could n't permanently live the life of a royal			1
the couple remain good friends though and are reported to keep in touch regularly by phone , while their paths also frequently cross at society weddings of friends they share .			0
