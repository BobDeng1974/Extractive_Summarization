those who saw the eight men riding into town that morning would later recall an uneasy feeling that rippled in their wake			2
druggist @entity6 watched them cross the iron bridge , the sound of their horses ’ hooves briefly drowned out by the rush of water into the mill dam below , and worried at their ‘ reckless , bold swagger			2
’ he judged them ‘ dangerous men to handle			2
it was 10am , 7 september 1876			0
@entity23 was about to experience ‘ the hottest day it ever saw			1
’ and the @entity25 were about to embark on the disastrous bank job that today stands in history as the raid that both sparked their downfall and cemented the legend of their most infamous member , @entity31			1
sixteen years old and already a cold - blooded killer , @entity31 , above , fought in the @entity35 - after that , his brother said , they could only ever be outlaws now a compelling new book has chronicled that day , the epic manhunt that followed and the fates of the gang members up to @entity31 ’s assassination and beyond			1
. in ‘ @entity43 : @entity31 , @entity44 , and the @entity46 ’s @entity45 ’ award - winning author and historian @entity47 reveals the workings of the gang , using previously unseen documents and eye - witness accounts			1
he reveals the catastrophic miscalculation that led to the chaos that left two robbers and two townsfolk dead			1
he charts the extraordinary escape across 14 days and some of the country ’s most forbidding terrain that drew admiration from the lawmen hunting the criminals down and citizens following their story			0
and he names the man who shot @entity31 as @entity68			1
a member of the gang @entity31 himself formed after the @entity72 crew fell apart			1
the iron bridge over which the @entity25 rode into @entity23 on that fateful day in 1876 - the ' hottest day @entity23 ever saw			1
' @entity75 cut @entity31 down as he stood to adjust a picture in the parlour of his home			1
@entity31 was parnoid after a life on the run and had invited @entity75 and his brother @entity81 to live with him and his wife @entity82 and protect them			1
instead the man who had survived shooting battles and daring raids , died as he had lived ; by the bullet and for bounty			0
while his wife wept by her dying husband ’s side @entity88 and @entity89 , mr @entity47 writes : ‘ quickly grabbed their hats and also @entity31 ’s revolvers and gun belt and hurried off for the town ’s only telegraph office			1
‘ once there , @entity89 paced nervously … as @entity88 tried several times to write out a telegram			0
’ when he finally handed a piece of paper to the operator it read as follows : ‘ meet me in @entity106 tonight or tomorrow			0
' @entity108 , left , and @entity109 , right , in death : shot down by the people of @entity23 and left in the dust @entity113 , left , wounded in the @entity23 raid and brother @entity115 , above , captured the telegram was addressed to @entity117 , governor of @entity118 who had placed a $ 10,000 reward on @entity31 , dead - $ 40,000 if he was taken alive but no - one really believed @entity31 would be taken alive			1
‘ if you hear they ’ve captured me alive , ’ he once said to a cousin			1
‘ say it ’s a lie ; they may kill me , but they will never get me otherwise			0
’ that they captured him at all was an event that , according to mr @entity47 , had its beginnings in the chaos of @entity23 , @entity130 and the raid on the town ’s @entity132			1
@entity31 and @entity134 , four years his senior , had been riding and raiding with @entity136 and @entity113 since the end of the @entity35			1
along with @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity139 they made up the @entity140 - @entity25			1
if the @entity31 brothers had been brutal to begin with a botched attempt to arrest them at their home only hardened their resolve			1
officers were one day too late to catch the gangsters but their 8 year old brother was killed and their mother maimed in the attempt			2
they were feared and rightly so			0
@entity31 , with his bright blue eyes and horsemanship was a dazzling sort of figure by all accounts but the glint in those eyes was steel			1
he murdered without missing a beat – all of them did			0
the gang had chosen @entity23 , @entity130 because it was small and thought to be peaceable			1
but most importantly there was only one bank and recent newspaper stories had reported that a new safe and time lock and two heavy doors for the vault had just been added to @entity132 ’s building			2
this did n’t put the gang off			2
they reasoned the threat of a gun would be enough to persuade most men to unlock a vault			0
it just meant that all the money in town was in one place and if there was enough of it to make it worth investing in a such security there was enough to make it worth robbing			0
scene of the crime : inside @entity189 's @entity132 , the vault door that @entity191 attempted to shut with fatal consequences is clearly visible blueprint of a disaster : the floorplan for @entity132 at the time of the raid , @entity196 's desk at the door to the vault is to the top right the positions of @entity204 and @entity205 ( wounded in the raid ) are shown at the bottom of the plan the day they rode into @entity23 they were ‘ at the top of their game			1
’ mr @entity47 writes : ‘ they excelled at deception			0
. as outlaws they took on aliases , stopped trains or emptied bank vaults while moving freely in public telling people they were livestock dealers , businessmen or land speculators			2
’ yet something was amiss from the start at @entity23			1
@entity31 once stated , ‘ it is true we are robbers , but we always rob in the glare of the day and in the teeth of the multitude			1
’ but @entity23 was the town that bit back			1
cuckoo in the next : @entity68 lived with @entity31 who had asked him to protect him			1
instead he shot him dead for $ 10,000 in cash the bank staff resisted			2
frustrated , @entity239 fired shots above bookkeeper @entity196 ’s head			0
in the smoke and confusion a colleague though he had been shot and made a run for it , bringing more shots from the robber			2
the town was alerted to the raid taking place			2
all their money was held in that building – all uninsured			0
the gun battle lasted less than ten minutes – panicked the gang members who had been keeping watched dashed to and fro amid bullets and rocks that arced through the air as locals fought with anything to hand			2
inside all was confusion and violence			0
mr @entity47 states , ‘ while the townspeople were shooting to kill , the outlaws ’ shots were really meant to frighten , to scare away , to buy time – at least in the beginning			0
’ keeping watch outside , panic growing @entity272 signalled the retreat : ‘ for @entity277 ’s sake , ’ he shouted			0
they are shooting us all to pieces			0
’ when it was over robbers @entity108 and @entity109 lay dead in the street			0
bookkeeper @entity196 had a bullet in his head and another local had been killed in the frenzy outside			0
the gang ’s haul totalled just $ 26.60 ‘ in coin and crip			2
’ @entity292 had been hit			0
they left , six men on five horses and for the next 14 days evaded captuer in what became the largest manhunt in @entity299 history			2
more than 1000 men chased them across marsh and woodland			0
@entity272 later recalled : ‘ we suffered in those fourteen days a hundred deaths			0
’ the public followed the tale with horror and excitement as reporters wrote of the robbers ’ escape with undisguised awe			0
mr @entity47 quotes one report in the local news : ‘ here were six men hunted by a thousand … every device was resorted to			0
every rod of a vast extent of country was searched			0
the best detective talent employed			0
the best woodsmen were engaged in the hunt			0
@entity47 's account of the @entity23 raid and the chain of events it set off is the most detailed yet ‘ yet in the face and eyes of eager pursuers they have passed through the most carefully arranged traps			1
‘ such determination , daring and perseverance			0
. can not but evoke the admiration even of those who most desire their extermination			0
’ ultimately his brother ’s wound slowed them down			2
@entity136 would n’t leave him so the @entity31 brothers split from the rest and the gang as it had been known and feared ceased to exist			1
the straggling gang members were arrested and convicted			2
the @entity346 grew as they continued to evade capture			0
had they been able to live the new lives they ultimately both established as farmers in @entity353 that might have been that			0
but for @entity31 , mr @entity47 writes : ‘ the rush of that wind - in - your - face , gun - in - your - hand lifestyle was like a drug			1
he started a new gang			2
but it had none of the ‘ honour ’ of his old brothers in arms			0
@entity31 was shot on 3 april 1882			1
he was 34 years old			0
terrified of suffering a similar fate - older brother @entity134 gave himself up			1
nobody knows the details of the deal he struck , but the man who rode as part of the most notorious gang in the @entity46 was never charged with a single crime			2
instead he returned to the @entity118 farm where he and @entity376 were raised , giving tours for 75 cents			0
as for @entity31 , the last sound he heard was the click of the metallic hammer as @entity68 cocked his revolver and took aim			1
but his fate had been sealed years earlier , on 3 september 1876 , at the @entity132 in @entity23			1
it was the day @entity31 ’s legend was cemented and it was the day his luck truly ran out			1
