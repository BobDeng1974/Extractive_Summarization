@entity0 , the @entity2 running back who shuns the media the same way he avoids tacklers , is a man of few words and he had just seven of them at his @entity10 appearance on tuesday			1
' i 'm here so i wo n't get fined , ' @entity0 said in response to every question he faced during his mandatory session , which he abruptly cut off after about five minutes			1
this after saying the phrase 25 times in a row , and avoiding a potential fine of $ 500,000 from the @entity19 had he not shown up			1
wearing a baseball cap and dark sunglasses that hid any hint of expression , @entity0 was greeted with a loud ovation from fans who paid to watch the @entity10 sideshow before the player known as @entity0 on the field slipped into silent mode			0
@entity0 spent nearly five minutes repeating the same answer before shouting ' time ' and walking away from the microphone , apparently confident he had fulfilled his @entity10 obligation			0
while the @entity2 are willing to tolerate @entity0 's silent treatment of the media , the @entity19 has shown it does not take a similar view			1
twice before @entity0 has been fined $ 50,000 for refusing to speak to reporters and was fined another $ 20,000 for making an obscene gesture after scoring a touchdown in the @entity2 ' nfc championship game win over @entity52			2
@entity54 quarterback @entity53 ( above ) also appeared at @entity10 @entity55 ( above ) spoke to the press for the first time since his comments on @entity59 there was certainly not the slightest hint of any enjoyment in @entity0 's latest run in with the media and it is almost certain that the @entity19 will not be impressed with his farcical display			2
' first off , let 's not miss that he is a very unique individual and he has a way that we have embraced , that we understand @entity0 and we support him every way we can , ' @entity68 head coach @entity67 said this week			0
' but , he is a very unique guy and he 's got his own way of looking at things and he 's also a very private person too			0
' that 's why the media thing is as it is			0

@entity0 , the @entity2 running back who shuns the media , gave the same response to 25 questions at @entity83
@entity0 said every time he was asked a question ; ' i 'm here so i wo n't get fined '
this after the @entity19 *threatened* him with a fine of $ 500,000 if he did not make an appearance in front of the press
