by @entity0 published : 15:58 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 18:29 est , 13 march 2013 solicitors and insurers were at loggerheads today over who is to blame for the growing £ 2billion a year ‘ whiplash epidemic ’ that is driving up the cost of cover for millions of motorists and adding £ 90 to the average policy			1
the insurers pinned the blame on drivers exploiting whiplash as ‘ the fraud of choice ’ or using lawyers to pursue dubious claims to win massive pay - outs			1
but lawyers hit back saying it was the insurers themselves who had a vested interest and that their plans would simply boost their own profits while limiting the rights of innocent motorists suffering genuine whiplash injuries			1
the @entity28 has said ' whiplash claims cost £ 2 billion a year , adding an extra £ 90 a year to the average motor insurance premium ' ( file picture ) the ‘ spotlight ’ should now be turned on insurers to ensure that insurers pass on savings to customers , said the solicitors			1
the row broke out as the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) published its own ideas to ministers to ‘ curb the @entity42 ’s whiplash epidemic ’ in response to a @entity45 consultation on the issue			1
the @entity28 said anyone claiming whiplash injury should be required to undergo examination by an independently accredited medical expert with no links to the claimant ’s solicitors : ‘ any claimant whose whiplash claim is in part exaggerated or made up should automatically have their entire claim dismissed			1
’ it noted : ‘ whiplash claims cost £ 2 billion a year , adding an extra £ 90 a year to the average motor insurance premium ’			0
but the @entity61 ( @entity62 ) retorted by saying the @entity28 ’s proposals ‘ would restrict access to justice ’			2
the solicitors fear there is a ‘ severe risk ’ that impending reforms aimed at bringing down costs in the motor accident claims system ‘ will distort the balance of rights between claimants and defendants ’			0
the @entity28 said anyone claiming whiplash injury should be required to undergo examination by an independently accredited medical expert ( file picture ) it adds : ' the @entity28 ’s proposals would further restrict access to the independent legal advice that accident victims need while at the same time generating greater profit for insurers			2
’ the lawyers also took offence at any suggestion that lawyers were in anyway colluding with ‘ exaggerated claims			0
’ @entity62 chairman @entity92 said : ' the @entity28 ’s sweeping statements about dismissing claims where there is any suspected exaggeration is disingenuous and frankly unhelpful			0
it demonstrates that insurers know very little about how lawyers work with their clients to put forward an honest case or the nature of living with a whiplash injury			2
’ he said : ' the whole industry wants to see insurance premiums come down			0
the spotlight must now turn to the insurance industry , to ensure that they fulfil their promise to pass on the savings they are going to make to their customers			0
’ but @entity113 , the @entity28 ’s assistant director of motor and liability insisted : ' we believe our proposals offer the best cure for the @entity42 ’s whiplash epidemic			1
insurers want to make it simpler and quicker for genuine whiplash claimants to get fair compensation			0
but whiplash is notoriously difficult to diagnose , which means that for too many people it has become the fraud of choice			2
’ he added : ' our proposals will ensure better medical assessment of whiplash claims , offer a quick , simple way of paying genuine claims , provide certainty for claimants and compensators and deter fraud that ends up being paid for through higher motor insurance premiums			0

insurers claim drivers exploit whiplash as ' fraud of choice '
lawyers says insurers ' plans would simply boost their own profits
@entity28 suggested ways to curb ' whiplash epidemic '
