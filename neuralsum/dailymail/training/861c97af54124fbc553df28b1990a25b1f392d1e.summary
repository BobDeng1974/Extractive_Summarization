four years ago , @entity0 scored one of the best goals of his career , an overhead kick against @entity5			1
for some time afterwards , @entity5 captain @entity6 admitted the image of @entity0 mid-air was burned on to his retina			1
@entity10 won the @entity11 that season			1
@entity0 ’s return of 16 club goals was modest for him but many of them were important			1
he scored against @entity18 , @entity19 ( twice ) , @entity20 and in a @entity24 semi-final and final against @entity22 and @entity23 respectively			0
now , @entity0 – the captain of his club and his country – is having to adjust to drastically changed circumstances at @entity29 and one wonders just how long @entity32 ’s most celebrated modern centre forward will allow it to last			2
@entity0 scores the memorable overhead kick against @entity5 on february 12 , 2011 the @entity10 captain stands in celebration of his wonder strike at @entity29 @entity0 scored 16 goals during the 2010 - 11 season to help @entity10 win the @entity11 title 13 - the 29 - year - old has just 13 shots on target in 21 league appearances this season			1
last season he registered 43 shots on target in 29 appearances			2
84.38 - his pass accuracy has increased this season playing in a deeper role			1
4 - but only four of his 1,210 passes have set up team - mates for league goals			2
he has created 30 chances in 21 games , compared to 56 in 29 last season			0
the statistics of @entity0 ’s season are remarkable			2
he is in the middle of his worst scoring run since 2006 – having scored in just one of his last 11 @entity10 games – and has not managed to have a single shot on goal since the turn of the calendar year			1
that last statistic is so startling , @entity0 himself was stunned to learn of it			0
but when he looks back at his latest 90 minutes , against @entity72 on wednesday , he will certainly begin to understand it			1
@entity0 has not always played as a traditional number nine at @entity10			1
he has played left and right and he has played in the fashionable ten position			0
he has always been a selfless and versatile footballer			0
in @entity79 ’s team , however , @entity0 has been asked to perform a conventional midfield role			1
on wednesday – after an injury to @entity82 – he spent an hour playing in front of his own back four			1
after an injury to @entity82 , the @entity10 skipper was deployed in front of the back four against @entity72 @entity0 's heat map against @entity72 shows that he spent the majority of the game behind the halfway line the 29 - year - old joins @entity93 in celebration of the defender 's second goal of the night it was a staggering and unedifying sight as @entity10 ’s most potent forward player scuffled about in the cheap seats simply because @entity100 – by his own subsequent admission – had no one else in his squad he could trust to do it			1
in the second half he was booked			0
those of us who have watched @entity0 over the years recognised the pattern			0
as his frustration built , he began to niggle at opponents , snipe at the officials			0
he was eventually cautioned for persistent offending			0
as always , he did his utmost to drag his team through the game			0
up ahead of him , though , the glamour pairing of @entity118 and @entity119 lumbered through the night like a couple on a rather uncomfortable first date			0
they were wooden and inhibited and @entity100 eventually called time early by hauling @entity119 from the field			2
@entity79 has been asking @entity0 to play in a conventional midfield role @entity10 loanee @entity119 ( right ) has struggled to make an impact when playing up front the former @entity128 youngster gets stuck into a challenge during @entity10 's 2 - 0 victory in january publicly , @entity0 has said nothing about his current role			1
he admires @entity100 , is impressed by his cv and his thoroughness and clarity			0
be under no illusion , though , this will be irritating the hell out him			0
eventually we can expect the dam to burst and if that happens @entity100 will have a problem to deal with			2
still only 29 , @entity0 remains ambitious and , more importantly , he still sees himself as a centre forward			2
he is by all accounts proving to be a much better captain than some at @entity29 expected , especially away from the field			0
publicly , @entity0 has said nothing about his current role and admires @entity10 boss @entity100 @entity0 is in the middle of his worst scoring run since 2006 – having scored in just one of his last 11 games nevertheless , @entity0 still has a desperate hunger for goals and glory , both collective and individual			1
the longer he remains stuck 25 goals behind sir @entity159 ’s club record of 249 and the longer @entity10 remain muddled and detached from genuine league title contention , the greater the risk of disenfranchising the player @entity100 ’s team really should be built around			1
the days of @entity165 clubs playing two centre forwards – the @entity168 / @entity167 days - are all but gone			0
in some ways , coaches have become too sophisticated for their own good			0
@entity0 understands this but is also self - aware enough to always have one eye on his own future			2
after all , when he signed his big new contract in february 2014 , he did not do so thinking that only a year later he would be spending his time doing a less than convincing impression of @entity180			0
@entity10 have had to do without defensive midfielder @entity180 ( right ) for large parts of the season @entity0 remains stuck 25 goals behind sir @entity159 ’s club record of 249 for @entity10			1

@entity0 played an hour in front of @entity10 's defence vs @entity72
@entity0 was *filling* in for the injured @entity82 on wednesday night
@entity79 has been playing @entity0 in midfield for most of the season
he is just *26* goals away from becoming @entity10 's all - time top scorer
29 - year - old scored overhead kick winner against @entity5 in 2011
