@entity1 's storied yellow cabs are taking a back seat to black cars			1
uber cars , often black sedans that can be summoned with smartphone apps , now outnumber the yellow taxis that city riders have hailed with a whistle and a wave for generations			2
it was a changing - of - the - guard moment that passed with little fanfare this week in figures released by the city 's @entity15 : 14,088 registered @entity18 cars compared with 13,587 yellow cabs			1
uber cars , which are hailed by an app , now outnumber the yellow taxis in @entity1 , a place famous for its classic yellow cars ( file photo ) but it hardly means yellow cabs are out of favor			1
in fact , there are about 440,000 yellow cab rides a day , compared to just 20,000 to 30,000 uber rides			1
that 's because @entity18 drivers often own their own cars and work less than 40 hours a week , while most yellow taxis are owned by cab companies , have more than one driver and are on the road close to 24 hours a day			2
' yellow cab rides significantly outstrip the number of black car rides , ' said @entity43 , chairwoman of the taxi commission			2
' so the number of their affiliated vehicles in and of itself does n't paint a complete picture			0
' @entity18 was introduced in @entity1 in 2011 and has grown steadily in popularity , particularly among tech - savvy customers who are comfortable hailing rides through an app that shows when a car is on the way			1
a customer can even follow its progress with a blip on a street map			0
similar companies such as @entity61 use apps to connect with riders			0
prices are comparable , but some @entity18 riders have complained about fare add - ons for larger vehicles and ' surge pricing ' during rush hour , bad weather or holidays			0
figures released by the @entity1 's @entity15 shows that 14,088 registered @entity18 cars compared with 13,587 yellow cabs in the city ( file photo ) ' i absolutely do love the convenience , and if it 's not surge pricing i find the costs very comparable and in some cases cheaper than yellow taxis , ' said @entity84 , a paralegal who uses @entity18 about three times a week			1
uber spokesman @entity86 declined to comment on the significance of the numbers of @entity18 cars surpassing yellow cabs			1
but some drivers and their advocates grumbled that @entity18 's growth has flooded the market , lowering average incomes for all drivers			0
' @entity18 having an unlimited number of cars means no drivers — taxi or black car and livery — will earn a decent living , ' said @entity104 , executive director of the @entity105 , an advocacy group that includes both @entity18 and yellow cab drivers as members			2
@entity108 , who has been driving a yellow cab since 2004 , said he once could count on at least 30 fares a day			0
but his take has dropped 30 to 40 percent since @entity18 and other such car services entered the @entity1 market			0
' it 's a jungle , ' he said , ' and the big fish always eat the small fish			0
' @entity1 's 13,587 yellow cabs are in competition with smartphone - driven newcomers on city streets , especially the 14,088 registered @entity18 cars that now outnumber cabs			1
here 's a look at how the basic operations of the two compare			0

there are 14,088 registered @entity18 cars and 13,587 yellow cabs in @entity1
but there are about 440,000 yellow cab rides a day and just 20,000 to 30,000 uber rides
uber cars , which can be summoned by a *smarthphone* app , were introduced in @entity1 in 2011 and has grown steadily in popularity
