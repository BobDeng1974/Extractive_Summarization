by @entity0 last updated at 10:25 am on 16th september 2011 for a long time , the idea of galloping with the breeze in his mane was just a dream for @entity6			1
@entity8 and neglected , the poor horse had piled on 20 stone and could barely walk			1
and to make matters worse , his hooves had become so overgrown , they looked like @entity15 ’s slippers			0
what a turn up : @entity6 was rescued from a field of cows where he had been overfed , which experts say is as cruel as underfeeding @entity21 : @entity6 's painful hooves made him look like he was wearing a pair of extra long @entity25 slippers @entity6 was eventually rescued from a farm in @entity27 , where he had been living with a herd of cows			1
his hooves , which should have been trimmed every six to eight weeks , had been left for over two years			0
‘ @entity6 's hooves measured 12 inches from heel to toe , and were turned up like @entity15 's slippers , ’ said @entity30 , of @entity31 , an equine rehabilitation centre			1
he was discovered by horrified officials along with another overweight horse , @entity39 , and the pair were given a combined weight loss target of 60 stone			2
six months on , @entity6 has lost a staggering 18 stone and is down to 69 stone , while @entity39 has shed 20 stone - the weight of an adult donkey - and is continuing to shed the pounds			1
‘ when most people think of animal cruelty , it 's a lack of food that comes to mind			0
' but as with children , overfeeding with the wrong types of food can be equally unkind			0
‘ the pain these animals went through is unthinkable			0
this was completely avoidable and an inexcusable case of neglect			0
’ @entity61 : @entity6 is lean and happy after being cared for by an animal charity and having his hooves trimmed @entity30 added : ‘ it was so upsetting to see them both trying to walk on their flipper - like feet			1
‘ although our expert farrier managed to trim the vast majority of hoof back quite quickly , it will take a long time and specialist trimming for their hooves to become the right shape again			0
’ during treatment , @entity78 showed how @entity6 's hoof bones had rotated and dropped and if they had been left , the bone could have penetrated through the sole of the hoof			2
both @entity6 and @entity39 have been taking painkillers each day for the last six months and @entity39 has been wearing special shoes for support .			2
