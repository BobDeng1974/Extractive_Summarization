by @entity0 published : 15:06 est , 21 march 2012 updated : 08:21 est , 22 march 2012 spurned by the @entity2 after its high - profile signing of @entity4 this week , @entity1 is heading to @entity5			1
the deal to bring the quarterback to the @entity8 was confirmed on wednesday evening despite contractual issues which placed the move in threat at the last minute			1
hours after the @entity8 announced they had agreed in principle to take @entity1 off the @entity2 ' hands for fourth - and sixth - round draft picks , the deal reportedly hit a snag			1
@entity18 football insider @entity17 reported that provisions in @entity1 's contract caused complications in the completion of the trade , saying that the document has $ 5million worth of ' recapture language , ' which meant the @entity8 would have to pay back some money to the @entity2			1
sent packing : the @entity8 announced today that they struck a deal with the @entity2 to bring @entity1 to the @entity28 hot property : @entity1 , pictured doing his famous move before a game against the @entity32 in november , is on his way to the @entity8 the move to bring @entity1 to @entity5 had many fans and gridiron pundits shaking their heads , especially since the team gave its starting quarterback @entity39 a three - year , $ 40.5million contract extension earlier this month			1
with the @entity44 's salary cap , @entity1 's base salaries for the next few seasons were attractive : $ 1.942 million in 2012 , $ 2.266 million in 2013 and $ 2.590 million in 2014			2
the question of @entity39 taking a back seat are yet to be answered , but @entity1 would be facing the hounding @entity5 media and the volatile @entity8 locker room , led by its vocally - impulsive coach @entity49			1
several teams , including his hometown @entity51 , were among the possible suitors for @entity1			2
while some have made the argument that the @entity8 and @entity1 are a good fit , not everyone is putting the welcome mat outside @entity58			1
during speculation last night that the @entity8 were going to make a run on the quarterback , the team ’s outspoken cornerback @entity59 let out a groan on one of the world ’s largest soapboxes - @entity66			2
public display of rejection : as the @entity8 pursued @entity1 last night , the team 's outspoken cornerback @entity59 bashed the move on @entity66 last night , one of several @entity75 tweets said : ‘ we do n't need @entity1			2
we sell out every home game let him go to @entity77 or @entity78			0
our wildcat offense can b ran by @entity80 or @entity81 we straight he later added : ‘ i do n't know y ( sic )			0
we have @ @entity82 and jus ( sic ) signed @entity85 [ @entity86 ]			0
@entity39 has taken us to 2 @entity88 championship game			0
we need to build on the team we have now ’			0
today , after the deal was done , he continued his critique of the @entity8 front office for making the trade			2
' y ( sic ) bring @entity1 in when we need to bring in more weapons for @ @entity82 let 's build the team around him			0
we already signed to 3 year ext '			0
defensive end @entity98 also took to the social networking site to weigh in , telling his @entity1 - minded followers : ‘ we had a bad yr but we ai n't that bad '			0
others welcomed the faith - minded quarterback , including @entity106 gov @entity105 and the office of @entity5 mayor @entity108			0
@entity1 , who led the @entity2 to the first round of the playoffs last season ( including a win over the @entity8 ) , became expendable when the @entity2 signed @entity4 to a five - year , $ 96million deal this week			1
the @entity8 were briefly a part of the cavalcade of @entity44 teams that pursued @entity4			1
new qb : @entity1 was spurned by the @entity2 after @entity4 , pictured here with @entity2 owner @entity119 , left , and @entity120 , vice president of football operations , decided to join the team @entity1 is expected to add a versatile dimension to the @entity8 ' offense , including running the team 's wildcat formation - something new offensive coordinator @entity125 enjoys using			1
he also provides a solid presence in a locker room that was strife with infighting last season - particularly a very public squabbled between @entity39 and wide receiver @entity131			0
now , fans may wonder : can the @entity133 survive @entity134 and @entity135 in the same sports market ?			0

@entity1 has left the @entity2 for the @entity8
the quarterback was traded after the @entity2 brought in @entity4
it looked as *negotiations* had broken off after teams hit a snag over $ 5m *fee* but the deal was ' *resurrected* ' at the last minute
