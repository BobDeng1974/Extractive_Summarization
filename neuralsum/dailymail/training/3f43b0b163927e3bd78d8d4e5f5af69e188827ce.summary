by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:20 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 05:42 est , 13 september 2013 cabinet minister @entity2 said @entity4 voters should not become isolationist @entity2 yesterday said @entity4 personnel should be sent to @entity6 to destroy the regime ’s chemical weapons as he branded the public guilty of ‘ isolationism ’ for failing to back military action			1
the veteran cabinet minister signalled that @entity4 is prepared to help police a deal to destroy @entity16 ’s lethal stockpile after the dictator yesterday admitted he had weapons of mass destruction and was prepared to give them up			1
government sources said a @entity23 report to be published next week is expected to reveal fresh evidence that @entity16 ’s regime fired sarin nerve gas last month , killing nearly 1,500 civilians			2
he ruled out sending in troops insisting he was ‘ flatly against boots on the ground ’ but said the @entity4 must stand ready to implement the extraordinary @entity33 plan to put the chemical weapons beyond use			1
with @entity38 @entity37 poised to vote on missile strikes against the @entity16 regime this week , the @entity6 government dramatically accepted a @entity33 proposal to turn over control of its chemical weapons to the international community			1
@entity45 has demanded a deadline be set for the plan to be enacted to prove it was a serious one			2
speaking to journalists in @entity49 today , mr @entity2 said : ‘ i think we have got to be cautious , we have got to be careful			1
‘ we must ensure that this is genuinely going to remove these chemical weapons and then all these things can be decided			2
‘ but i think the @entity4 will be supportive of anything which genuinely looks like bringing an end to the threat of gas attacks and chemical weapons that is lurking there in @entity6 at the moment			1
’ asked if that could mean weapons against from the @entity4 military being sent in to @entity6 , mr @entity2 replied : ‘ i ca n’t think of any reason in principle why if @entity4 expertise is required , @entity4 expertise should not be involved			1
‘ as far as i am aware nobody has yet asked that question			0
' he went on : ‘ i would always be flatly against boots on the ground in the @entity6 civil war but actually experts in chemical warfare , if we were persuaded that we needed to make a contribution to their destruction , fine			1
‘ but at the moment we are at a very early stage			0
we have got to get the outcome we want without being perceived to be naïve about exactly the basis upon which it is going to proceed			0
’ while the diplomacy continues , the conflict rumbles on			0
a @entity6 government solider is pictured in @entity87 village , northeast of the capital @entity89 @entity2 today backed @entity90 as a ' contender ' to become the next @entity93 leader			1
he said the chancellor is ' bound to be a contender at any stage '			0
but he insisted : ' i can think of nothing more harmful to the interest of my party or any of its members than to start speculating about that kind of thing			0
' he also warned @entity105 mayor @entity104 not to get carried away with the media frenzy around his own leadership ambitions			0
' i did give the advice to @entity104 when we had @entity110 at last year ’s party conference , when the whole thing erupted far beyond i think what @entity104 expected			0
' he arrived to find the whole place in mass media turmoil			0
my advice to him , if he has interests in the leadership , i would cool it			0
' mr @entity2 warned @entity4 against ' isolationism ' and said one of the big failures of the new @entity123 government was the legacy of the @entity126 war in making voters scepticial of the need to intervene overseas in the national interest			1
rebel forces dismissed the @entity33 proposal as ‘ a cheap trick to buy time for the regime to kill more and more people ’			2
any deal with @entity6 to hand over its chemical weapons in the middle of a chaotic civil war would be difficult for inspectors to enforce and destroying them would likely take years , @entity38 officials and experts caution			1
@entity6 's strongest backer , @entity33 , proposed on monday that @entity89 save itself from a @entity38 military strike over its alleged use of chemical weapons by putting its stockpiles under international control			1
the proposal was welcomed by @entity6 and seized upon by the secretary - general of the @entity23			1
@entity38 president @entity151 said the offer was a potential breakthrough but had to be handled with scepticism			2
deputy prime minister @entity155 today said there had to be an end to the military conflict			0
he told @entity159 : ‘ you ca n’t sort of hermetically seal @entity6 ; that ’s just not realistic			2
‘ so at the end of the day , you have to really pressure these two sides to recognise that there is no resolution to this militarily			0
‘ and here is always a big difficulty with conflict , is if the sides in the conflict do n’t want peace as much as the outside world , it ’s always going to be a bit of a struggle			0
‘ they ’ve got to at some point recognise that they ’re on a hiding to nothing by carrying on this conflict			0

@entity2 says @entity4 should support ' anything ' to end gas attacks
warns against @entity4 ' isolationism ' *blocking* intervention overseas
@entity38 secretary of state @entity192 *floated* idea of handing over weapons
plan was seized on by @entity33 and @entity6 to derail @entity38 threat of strikes
@entity2 also backs @entity90 as a ' contender ' for future @entity93 leader
