' we 're not mascots ! ' said former @entity14 strong safety @entity84 , one of 29 speakers who took the microphone on a lawn just steps from the stadium entrances			1
@entity90 , who is part @entity55 , wore a black @entity14 cap with a feather sticking up out of it			2
' as a former player i feel really sad right now			0
... this is still standing in front of us , ' said @entity90 , a six - time @entity100 pick , who called the nickname a ' bullying tactic			0
' all out : many of the attendees wearing colorful , traditional @entity55 clothing and more holding signs disappointment : the squad lost 26 - 29 against the @entity14 at the end of a bad sunday for them hours later , the squad lost 26 - 29			1
