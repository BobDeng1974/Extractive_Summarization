passengers in driverless cars will need to be ready to take the wheel in a crisis , it has been reported			1
with the first trials of computer - controlled cars set to get underway , the government has started drafting rules that will require those inside the vehicles to remain alert and fit to drive at all times			1
a person sitting in the drivers seat will also still be required to wear a seatbelt and be responsible for speeding fines or penalties incurred , the @entity12 reported			0
companies are due to start testing driverless cars in the @entity20			1
@entity21 , @entity22 in south east @entity23 and @entity24 and @entity25 ( illustrated ) will all host autonomous driving projects that will run for between 18 and 36 months @entity27 , the head of one of the four official pilot projects , told the newspaper that they will be examining how long a driver can stay alert if they had nothing to do			2
' it is like the laws in the infancy of motoring when a man had to walk in front of a motor vehicle waving a red flag , ' he told the @entity12			0
ministers have previously admitted that the current @entity42 and rules of the road are inadequate for the new generation of vehicles which pilot themselves			2
@entity25 and @entity24 will share the @entity20 @entity48 programme ( pictured ) , which involves @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , universities and engineering consultancies			1
they will test self driving cars on real roads as well as light weight self driving pods designed for pedestrianised areas in @entity25 @entity21 , @entity22 in south east @entity23 and @entity24 and @entity25 will all host autonomous driving projects that will run for between 18 and 36 months starting this year			2
it is hoped that testing driverless cars in a real - world environment will help lead to greater levels of understanding of the vehicles and will allow the public to imagine how the cars could fit into everyday life			1
@entity24 and @entity25 : engineers involved in the @entity73 will develop infrastructure to best work with autonomous cars navigating real roads			2
driverless pods will ferry individuals around pedestrianised areas of @entity25			0
@entity22 : the @entity81 project will test automated electric shuttles buses and robotic valet parking			0
@entity21 : the insurance implications of driverless vehicles will be explored by the @entity87 consortium			0

@entity25 and @entity24 will share the @entity20 @entity48 programme , which involves @entity49 , @entity94 as well as a number of universities and engineering consultancies			1
they will test self - driving cars on real roads as well as lightweight self - driving pods designed for pedestrianised areas in @entity25			1
one of the focuses of the trial will be developing infrastructure to best interact with the cars			0
the scheme involves @entity109 , the aa and @entity110			0
finally , experts in @entity21 will investigate the insurance implications of driverless vehicles and study the public ’s response to the technology			0
the @entity87 consortium programme ‘ aims to deepen understanding of the impact on road users and wider society and open up new opportunities for our economy and society , ’ innovate @entity20 said			2
the hilly city ’s challenging terrain will also allow engineers to see how the cars cope with busy , winding roads			0
in @entity22 , the @entity81 project will test automated electric shuttle vehicles ( pictured ) , plus robotic valet parking for driverless cars			1
the scheme involves @entity109 , the @entity135 and @entity110 it is hoped that the data collected will be used to successfully introduce driverless cars in cities and towns across the @entity20 to reduce congestion , improve air quality and use roads more efficiently and safely			1
the chancellor announced an extra £ 9 million in funding for the new technology , adding to £ 10 million already promised in the summer			0
the aim is to establish the @entity20 as the global hub for the research , development and integration of driverless vehicles and associated technologies .			1
