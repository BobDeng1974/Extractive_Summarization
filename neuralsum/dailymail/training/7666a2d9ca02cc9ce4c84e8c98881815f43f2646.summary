in fact , @entity163 represents approximately one half of all intra-axial traumatic lesions			0
this lesion is the most significant cause of morbidity in patients with traumatic brain injuries , which most commonly result from high - speed motor vehicle accidents			0
any patient with a closed head injury who experiences extensive loss of consciousness and neurological deficits warrants neuroimaging			0
