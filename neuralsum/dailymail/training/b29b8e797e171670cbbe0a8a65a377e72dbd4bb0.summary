for decades it has been believed the change of life can cause the blues , with tens of millions of women around the world becoming snappy at this time			0
but the new @entity17 research found changes in the levels of the sex hormone oestrogen , which regulates a woman 's periods , were not linked to bad temper			1
women who suffer from mood swings while going through the menopause can no longer blame it on their hormones , according to a new study the menopause is caused by a change in the balance of the body 's sex hormones			1
in the lead up to it - perimenopause - oestrogen levels decrease , which causes the ovaries to stop producing an egg each month			1
but the new research focusing on a post-menopausal group not using hormone therapy found hormone concentrations were not related to memory , thinking or mood			1
the one exception was progesterone , which was connected with verbal memory and overall cognition in early menopause , but still not mood			2
the study , published online in @entity49 , is the first to investigate associations between sex hormones and cognition in both younger and older post-menopausal women			2
it is also the first to determine whether the hormones affect women differently based on their age and how much time has elapsed since they reached menopause			0
professor @entity58 , of @entity59 in @entity60 , said the findings help clarify the role of hormones in age - related brain disturbances			2
after menopause there is a permanent reduction in a woman 's levels of estradiol - the predominant oestrogen beforehand - estrone which is the main one after and progesterone , another hormone involved in the menstrual cycle			1
the research found hormone concentrations were not related to memory , thinking or mood several studies have examined the association between hormone concentrations and cognition but results have been inconsistent			1
some researchers have speculated that the effect of oestrogen on cognitive ageing could differ depending on when exposure occurs			2
professor @entity58 said : ' some effects might be more beneficial for younger post-menopausal women closer to the time of menopause than for older post-menopausal women			0
' this is known as the ' critical window			0
' in a study of 643 middle aged and elderly participants , he sorted his participants - whose ages ranged from 41 to 84 - into those who had gone into menopause less than six years previously and a later group who were beyond ten years			0
his researchers then gave the women a series of tests to gauge their memory and overall cognition before assessing them for depression and sampling their blood for the hormones			0
professor @entity58 said : ' we viewed the availability of hormone levels as an opportunity to test one aspect of the critical - window hypothesis - especially since we had two fairly large samples of women			1
' based on the critical - window theory - along with past animal studies showing the timing of estradiol replacement affects memory - prof @entity58 had hypothesized higher levels would boost memory in younger menopausal women			1
he said : ' instead we found no significant link - positive or negative - in either group			0
' he said the findings do n't ' necessarily mean oestrogens are irrelevant to cognition since we have no way of measuring oestrogen directly at the brain level			2
' professor @entity58 added : ' but they imply boosting blood levels of estradiol or estrone - even in younger post-menopausal women - may not have a substantial effect on cognitive skills one way or the other			0

new @entity17 research found changes in the levels of the sex hormone oestrogen , which regulates a woman 's periods , were n't linked to bad temper
hormone concentrations were also not related to memory or thinking
