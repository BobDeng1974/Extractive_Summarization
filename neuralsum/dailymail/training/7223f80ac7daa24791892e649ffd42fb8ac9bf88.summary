by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 13:57 est , 22 february 2013 updated : 14:55 est , 22 february 2013 legal woes : the @entity4 joined a civil fraud lawsuit against @entity6 filed by his former teammate @entity6 will now have to answer to the @entity4 for using performance - enhancing drugs during the @entity9			1
the agency told a federal court friday that it has joined a civil fraud suit filed two years ago by @entity6 's former teammate @entity13 under the @entity14 , according to @entity15			1
@entity17 chief executive @entity16 wrote attorney general @entity18 on january 14 , urging him to join the civil case and telling @entity18 that ‘ fraud and other crimes were committed ’ by @entity6 and other members of his former @entity24 teams			1
the letter is dated the same day @entity6 admitted his drug use to @entity27 in a television interview that was broadcast on january 17 and 18			2
the civil suit argues that because @entity6 ’s team used banned drugs and blood transfusions , they violated their sponsorship agreement with the @entity24			1
the @entity24 spent around $ 30million backing @entity6 's cycling team			1
under the @entity14 , the government can recover three times that amount in damages , bringing the total to nearly $ 100million , @entity36 reported			2
a quarter of that sum could go to @entity13 for his role as the whistle - blower who was among the first to publicly accuse @entity6 of cheating			0
besides @entity6 , the suit also names his agent , @entity48 , @entity50 's agency and the cycling team 's management company , @entity53			2
bad blood : former cyclist @entity55 , who admitted in 2006 to doping , was among the first people to publicly accuse @entity6 , right , of cheating during @entity9 races fraud allegations : the suit argues that because @entity6 ’s team used peds and blood transfusions , they violated their sponsorship deal with the @entity24 under the @entity14 in response , @entity6 ’s attorney @entity65 released a statement challenging the premise that the government was defrauded			1
‘ @entity6 and his representatives worked constructively over these last weeks with federal lawyers to resolve this case fairly , but those talks failed because we disagree about whether the @entity24 was damaged , ’ @entity65 said			0
‘ the @entity24 's services own studies show that the @entity24 benefited tremendously from its sponsorship -- benefits totaling more than $ 100million			2
’ @entity13 , who was stripped of the @entity80 title for using illegal substances , accuses @entity6 of committing fraud against the @entity24 , which sponsored most of @entity6 's teams as the star rider used @entity62 to win the tour a record seven times			1
@entity13 also was a key witness in a @entity17 investigation last year that exposed @entity6 's doping			1
he stands to collect a portion — potentially millions of dollars — of any possible financial penalties against @entity6			0
@entity17 officials had been urging @entity6 to speak under oath with its investigators if he hoped to have his lifetime ban reduced			1
@entity16 ’s letter was first reported thursday by @entity98 and the @entity0 independently obtained a copy from a person familiar with the case			0
costly claims : @entity24 spent about $ 30million backing @entity6 's team , and it is now in line to recover three times that amount - about $ 100million - in damages @entity6 and @entity17 officials talked on and off over a couple of months about the terms of the cyclist sitting down for a long interview to spill all he knows about doping in cycling , but @entity6 said wednesday he would not cooperate			1
a source familiar with discussions between the two sides said among the topics was how much protection @entity17 could provide @entity6 in the whistle - blower case and against possible criminal action			0
the cyclist and his attorneys ultimately were not satisfied with @entity17 's offer , the person said			0
in commenting wednesday on @entity6 's refusal to talk , @entity16 said that , ‘ over the last few weeks he has led us to believe that he wanted to come in and assist @entity17 , but was worried of potential criminal and civil liability if he did so			1
’ in his letter to @entity18 , @entity16 wrote that @entity17 ‘ uncovered one of the greatest frauds in the history of sport ’ but that his agency had reached the end of what it can do to punish @entity6 and other ‘ non-sports ’ people involved with his teams			2
‘ fraud and other crimes were committed , ’ @entity16 wrote , telling @entity18 that the case involved drug trafficking , federal witness intimidation and that other federal agencies have gathered more information			0
‘ @entity17 has already done the work in the sports case and won , ’ @entity16 wrote			0
coincidence : the head of @entity17 sent a letter to the @entity4 asking the agency to join the suit against @entity6 the same day the cyclist had admitted to doping in an interview with @entity27 @entity6 was the subject of a two - year federal grand jury investigation that was dropped a year ago without an indictment			1
@entity16 also told @entity18 that the @entity4 joining the case against @entity6 would be viewed favorably by the public and the media			2
the letter noted the federal government recently went after @entity13 for defrauding donors to his defense fund back when he still denied doping to win the 2006 @entity9			0
@entity16 called the doping by @entity6 and the @entity24 teams a ‘ massive economic fraud ’ that ‘ absolutely dwarfs anything @entity13 did			2
’ however , the government ’s case against @entity6 is far from airtight			0
the disgraced cyclist 's defense team could argue that the sponsorship deal with @entity24 did not expressly forbid team members from using blood transfusions during races			1
another major hurdle for the @entity4 would be proving that @entity6 had defrauded the government out of millions of dollars			0
the cyclist ’s attorneys would likely claim that not only did the @entity24 not lose money by backing the @entity24 team , but that in fact the agency came away with about $ 100million in value from media exposure			1
earlier this week , after more than two months of negotiations , @entity6 attorney @entity187 said that the cyclist wo n't speak to @entity17 about doping in cycling , calling it a process designed ' only to demonize selected individuals			2
' refusal : @entity6 wo n't interview under oath with the @entity17 , which may have been his only chance at ending his lifetime ban from cycling @entity6 had previously said he was willing to participate in an international effort to clean up a sport that is based mostly in @entity200			1
for years , @entity6 denied using performance - enhancing drugs			0
but last year , @entity17 released a report that detailed extensive doping on his seven @entity9 - winning teams and stripped him of those titles			0
@entity6 then admitted last month in an interview with ' @entity207 that he doped and used performance - enhancing drugs to win those races			2
' we remain hopeful that an international effort will be mounted and we will do everything we can to facilitate that result , ' mr @entity187 said in a statement			0
defense strategy : @entity6 's lawyers will likely argue that the cyclist had never expressly promised not to use blood transfusions , and that the @entity24 actually came away with $ 100million in value from the sponsorship deal ' @entity6 will not participate in @entity17 's efforts to selectively conduct @entity223 prosecutions that only demonize selected individuals while failing to address the 95 per cent of the sport over which @entity17 has no jurisdiction			1
' @entity6 is facing several legal challenges , and testifying under oath to @entity17 could have exposed him to further troubles			0
@entity6 also has been sued by a @entity232 - based @entity231 to recover more than $ 12million in bonuses			0
he also has been sued to by @entity234 in @entity235 to recover a libel judgment that @entity6 won against the paper .			0

government stands to recover nearly $ 100million in damages
attorney for the disgraced cyclist says that he will not submit to the @entity17 interview
