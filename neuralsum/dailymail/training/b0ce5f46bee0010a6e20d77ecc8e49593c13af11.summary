by @entity0 published : 10:10 est , 8 october 2012 updated : 06:32 est , 16 october 2012 @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 are set to go head to head in a unique battle for consumer 's cash			1
the tech giants are set to release tablets within days of each other later this month			1
@entity1 is expected to launch its ipad mini on october 17th - a week before @entity3 releases its tablets in the @entity14 , and @entity2 releases its own surface tablet			1
almost ready for prime time ? @entity17 revealed these images of the alleged eight - inch @entity19 , due to launch on october 17 the @entity19 launch comes as research suggests a quarter of us - 22 per cent - own a tablet , with another three per cent regularly borrowing someone else 's tablet for web browsing			1
about 68 per cent of the 9,5123 adults surveyed said they purchased their tablet within the last year			0
the @entity30 survey by the @entity31 also suggests the flood of cheaper tablets , such as the @entity34 or @entity35 , are weakening @entity1 's grip on the market			1
a year ago , @entity1 had more than 80 per cent of the market , but this has now dropped to less around 52 per cent			1
the @entity35 has 21 per cent of the market , meanwhile @entity41 's @entity40 tablet has eight per cent			1
out of those surveyed , 44 per cent of adults who said they have a smartphone , 46 per cent have an @entity45 phone , 38 per cent , have an @entity46 and 10 per cent have a @entity47			0
@entity1 's ipad mini is expected to so on sale around the world on november 2nd , according to online speculation			1
the launch date was reported by @entity53 , which cites @entity1 investors hearing the date from ' multiple sources '			1
the device is believed to have similar hardware to last year 's @entity59 , but reduced to a pocket - friendly seven or eight - inch form			1
@entity53 reports that @entity1 will send out invites for the launch on october 10 , gathering tech journalists and stakeholders together to unveil the device			1
@entity3 , meanwhile has already enjoyed huge success in the @entity30 with its updated @entity67 tablets - but will release them internationally for the first time on the 25th october			0
the gadgets , are available in both 7inch and 8.9inch versions ( although only the 7inch version is currently set to go o sale outside of the @entity30 )			1
the third contender is @entity2 , with its surface tablets			0
the firm will launch the surface tablet at the same time as @entity78 , the latest version of its desktop operating system , whcih experts say is a ' make or break ' time for the firm			0
' it 's a dangerous game , as all three firms are trying to steal each other 's thunder , ' said @entity87 of gadget @entity88			0
' @entity1 tend to be more cagey			1
' if i was @entity1 , and knew that @entity2 was launching , i 'd probably try and come up with something to take the focus away from them - and nobody else can do that in quite the same way @entity1 can			1
' @entity97 believes that @entity2 has so far played its cards close to its chest with the @entity101 firm has not even confirmed a price for the gadget			0
' @entity2 is the most interesting - it 's a make or break thing for them , as they have always struggled with touchscreen interfaces			0
' it has the potential to be a success - but the worry is that it will be overcomplicated compared to the @entity59			1
' however , it is @entity1 's ipad mini that is expected to attract most attention			1
' the ipad mini is potentially huge , ' said @entity97			0
' but a lot will depend on price			0
there are a lot of people who would like an @entity59 but ca n't afford one , so if it does launch and is £ 250 , it will be very difficult for anyone to beat			2
' experts also believe that @entity3 's @entity35 , which is being launched outside the @entity30 for the first tim , could be let down if not enough content is available			2
the gadget uses @entity3 's own app and film and book stores			0
@entity130 famously ruled on a smaller @entity59 , saying ' the current crop of 7 - inch tablets are going to be @entity133 , dead on arrival			2
' we do n't think you can make a great tablet with a 7 - inch screen			0
' however , devices like the @entity140 and @entity142 's @entity141 have shown that there is a market for smaller devices that consumers can use on public transport , causing @entity1 to reportedly change its mind on an ' ipad mini ' with a 7 or 8 inch screen			2
the firm has reportedly placed orders for ten million of the devices , which are also likely to feature the firms controversial new connector			0
' @entity35 is a difficult one , especially in the @entity14 , ' said @entity97			2
' it is dependent on its content delivery , and they will have to have a lot of @entity14 content at launch for it to work - but @entity35 is a very strong brand now			2
. however , @entity97 also believes that the technique could also backfire - by confusing consumers			0
' it is quite possible consumers will get confused , ' he said			0
' after the @entity46 launched , a lot of competitors came out , and people did get confused			0
the @entity59 will continue to be the benchmark , the danger for @entity2 and @entity3 is that people will ask ' can it do what an @entity59 does ? ' most secrecy has surround the @entity19 , a shrunken version of @entity1 's market - changing tablet , is expected to launch on october 17 , with the device available in shops on november 2			1
if @entity1 follows previous form , the event will be held in @entity181 , with a simultaneous launch on @entity183			2
images purporting to show the @entity19 suggest a device measuring 7.85inches , with an aluminium back - cover similar to the most recent @entity59			1
it is likely to sport a rear - facing camera and come with @entity1 's newest ' lightning ' connector , a controversial re-design which made previous accessories and chargers obsolete without an adapter			2
if @entity1 follows its usual design styles , it is likely to come in white and black versions , with a choice of @entity200 only , or a @entity202 option			2
the device , while still likely to garner a premium price - tag , will help @entity1 compete with the burgeoning smaller tablet market			2
the 7 - inch @entity34 tablet sells for £ 159 for the cheapest version , while @entity3 is also producing a budget tablet range			0
@entity130 was unconvinced that a smaller tablet would be a success , seeing it as a poor compromise between a tablet and a phone			0
however @entity1 appears to have had a change of heart , particularly now that the tablet market has now matured			0
one issue @entity1 might face by launching a @entity19 is a fragmentation in its core product lines			1
until the release of the @entity46 , @entity1 's two product lines had kept the same screen resolution , meaning apps did not need redesigning for different devices , a problem that plagues the competing @entity45 platform			0
but with the increased screen size of the @entity46 , some apps now have a black border , at least until the developers update their apps , and this problem may now afflict @entity1 's tablets , depending on the final size of the @entity19 .			1

*unprecedented* timing will see three launches this month
@entity19 , @entity240 and @entity35 all set to go on sale
*estimates* claim @entity1 has ordered 10 million @entity59 minis
