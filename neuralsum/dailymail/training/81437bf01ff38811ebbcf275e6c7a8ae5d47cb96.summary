by @entity0 published : 14:03 est , 14 july 2013 updated : 14:10 est , 14 july 2013 thousands of @entity1 yesterday rushed to telegram offices to send souvenir messages marking the last day of the country 's telegram service			1
the last - minute rush in messages brought the 162 - year - old service , the last major commercial telegram operation to a close			1
the service , which was set up in the heyday of the @entity13 , sent around 5,000 telegrams a day and employed 998 people in its 75 offices			2
last - minute : there was a surge in the number of customers in @entity22 yesterday			0
here , the central office in @entity24 is overrun with customers piece of history : @entity1 queued for a memento of the unique 162 - year service that was the main form of communication in the days before the internet and mobile phones stamped out : an employee stamps a message at @entity35 telegraph office , in @entity36 on the final day of the service all stop : a worker taps out a telegram at the @entity41 in @entity42			1
@entity1 disbanded the world 's last major telegram service on sunday with one final stop at the end , the @entity46 ( @entity46 ) , @entity1 â€™s state - run telegram service , wired its final message on sunday			1
at its peak in 1985 , the service relayed some 60 million messages every year and employed 12,000 people			1
today the remaining customers consist mainly of local government offices sending administrative messages to remote areas which are still not covered by the phone networks			0
back in the days of the @entity13 , the telegram service proved an absolutely vital means of control for a colonial power ruling over a vast expanse of land			1
origins : a team of workers lays the underwater cable that stretched from @entity1 to @entity69 in 1870 mechanics : a museum employee in @entity72 with an 1837 telegraphy machine of the type used in the early years the first 27 - mile stretch of line was laid by the @entity77 between @entity78 and @entity79 as early as 1851			1
to cope with @entity1 's stifling heat and humidity , the cables used were far thicker than those in @entity84 and @entity85 and were covered with a layer of cloth and pitch to keep out the dust and monsoon rains			1
one of the most famous early messages was sent to @entity93 in @entity78 in april 1852 announcing the fall of @entity95 during the during the second @entity96			2
communication : @entity98 , who led the struggle for @entity1 independence , relied heavily on telegrams to rally support and appeal for vital funds and when @entity1 troops rebelled in 1857 , sparking a widespread uprising against colonial rule , the telegram is credited with playing a crucial role in helping the @entity13 mobilise and regain control			1
after the uprising was quelled , lord @entity93 famously credited the telegram as having ' saved @entity1 for the @entity112 '			2
@entity113 , former managing director of @entity115 , which had a mandate to send telegrams overseas until 2002 , told the @entity118 : ' the telegraph allowed the @entity13 to relay information across large parts of @entity1 in almost real time			2
' this leap in communications proved decisive '			0
in 1870 , underwater cables were laid between @entity1 and @entity69 providing a vital link between @entity127 and @entity69 's largest and most valuable colony			1
but like many innovations introduced by the @entity69 , the telegram was quickly adopted by @entity1 for their own use			1
@entity98 , who led the struggle for @entity1 independence , relied heavily on telegrams to rally support and appeal for vital funds			2
and during the partition of the subcontinent in 1947 , the telegram would prove a vital link between families and friends at opposite ends of the country			2
@entity145 , who sixty - six years ago left @entity147 for @entity42 , remembers how she then used telegrams to keep in touch with her loved ones			0
' crossing the border meant risking your own life , ' she told @entity154 , ' at that time the telegram was the only way to keep families informed , give speedy updates and reunite			0
' prime minister @entity158 also relied on the telegram famously sending @entity13 prime minister @entity160 a message to request help from @entity163 when @entity147 troops invaded @entity165			0
@entity166 , a retired telegraph operator in @entity42 , remembers the service in its pomp as hundreds of workers crashed out the dots and dashes of @entity173 used on telegraph machines			0
plea for help : @entity1 prime minister @entity158 ( right ) famously sent @entity13 prime minister @entity160 ( left ) a message to request help from @entity163 when @entity147 troops invaded @entity165 he told @entity154 : ' the whole office sounded like a factory , ' he remembers			2
' sometimes we felt we knew every significant detail of our customer 's lives			0
' the word privacy did not exist in anyone 's dictionary then			0
' the service continued to be invaluable up until the 1990s with the advent of mobile communications			0
today @entity192 's old office , a colonial style building in the centre of capital barely sends out 10 messages a day and will soon be closed			1
he added : ' the new technology is so fast it just surprises me			0
communication is a game of speed , the fastest will always win the game			0
' eventually the telegraph system had to face defeat			0

at its peak in 1985 the service was relaying some 60 million messages a year
the network was set up in the 1850s during the early years of the @entity192
