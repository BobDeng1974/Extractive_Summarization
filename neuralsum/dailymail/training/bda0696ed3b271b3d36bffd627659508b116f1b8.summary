by @entity0 published : 06:33 est , 3 july 2012 updated : 07:10 est , 3 july 2012 a natural drug discovered in the soil of @entity4 could improve the memory of older people - and even treat @entity7 's , researchers say			1
in tests in mice , the drug halted the decline in brain function as they got older , and offered hope that it could also treat depression			1
the drug - rapamycin - is a bacterial by - product discovered in the shadows of the island 's famous statues			1
it is named after @entity4 , the @entity21 name for @entity4 , which sits isolated in the @entity22 - 2000 miles from anywhere			1
@entity4 heads : it is named after @entity4 , the @entity21 name for @entity4 , which sits isolated in the @entity22 - 2000 miles from anywhere a natural drug discovered in the soil of @entity4 could improve memory in older people - and even treat @entity7 's , researchers say it is already used in transplant patients to prevent organ rejection and now scientists in journal @entity35 say it can improve learning and help treat cognitive decline			1
it could even treat conditions like @entity7 's , they believe			1
a team from the @entity42 added the drug to the diet of healthy mice and discovered it improved learning and memory in young mice and memory in elder rodents			1
professor @entity51 said : ‘ we made the young ones learn , and remember what they learned , better than what is normal			0
‘ among the older mice , the ones fed with a diet including rapamycin actually showed an improvement , negating the normal decline that you see in these functions with age			1
’ the team also found three ‘ happy , feel - good ’ neurotransmitters - serotonin , dopamine and norepinephrine - were higher in the mice treated with rapamycin			2
the drug - rapamycin - is a bacterial by - product discovered in the shadows of the island 's famous statues this could help explain the effects on memory , she said , and helped back up previous research which showed @entity7 's like syndromes were lowered in mice treated with the drug			1
‘ this is super-interesting and something we are going to pursue in the lab , ’ she said			0
it also lowered anxiety and depressive - like behaviour in the mice , she @entity90 colleague dr @entity89 used a series of elevated tunnels that led to a catwalk to examine the behaviour of the rodents			2
mice prefer tunnels to open spaces and were watched on the catwalk			2
dr @entity89 said : ‘ all of a sudden the mice are in open space			0
‘ it 's pretty far from the floor for their size , sort of like if a person is hiking and suddenly the trail gets steep			0
it 's pretty far down and not so comfortable			0
’ mice with less anxiety were more curious to explore the catwalk , he said			0
he explained : ‘ we observed that the mice fed with a diet containing rapamycin spent significantly more time out in the open arms of the catwalk than the animals fed with a regular diet			0
’ similarly , when mice were handled by their tails they would struggle , but depressed mice would struggle less			0
‘ so we can measure how much and how often they struggle as a measure of the motivation they have to get out of an uncomfortable situation , ’ said dr @entity129			0
‘ we found rapamycin acts like an antidepressant - it increases the time the mice are trying to get out of the situation			2
‘ they do n't give up ; they struggle more			0

in tests on mice , the drug *reverses* decline caused by ageing
scientists believe it could be used as treatment for @entity7 's *disease*
the drug includes bacteria found in soil near the @entity4 statues
it is already used to treat transplant patients
it could also be used to treat depression
