@entity0 , the pioneer of the choke tackle , has rejected @entity4 coach @entity3 ' claims the technique is ' very dangerous '			1
@entity6 assistant coach @entity0 claimed @entity3 was ' wide of the mark ' to label the ploy ' a blight on the game ' , suggesting tackling with a bid to hold players off the ground leads to clashes of heads			1
former @entity16 rugby league star @entity0 devised the choke tackle in 2011 , where defenders wrap up attackers and hold them off the ground to form a stagnant maul that wins a turnover via the scrum put - in			1
@entity24 is choke tackled by @entity25 ( left ) and @entity26 at @entity27 last season the choke tackle involves a defender wrapping his arms around the neck and chest of the ball - carrier — often one who is isolated and too upright — and preventing him from going to ground			2
with assistance from team - mates , this can lead to the ball being stripped or a maul forming , which can produce a penalty to the defending team if the opposition collapse it in their bid retrieve the ball			0
if a maul forms and the ball does n’t emerge , the defending team will win the put - in at the subsequent scrum			0
@entity50 defended @entity6 's right to use the perfectly - legal tactic ahead of @entity54 's side hosting @entity55 in sunday 's @entity58 @entity57 eliminator			1
' look , there has been a little bit said			0
i 've got a lot of respect for @entity3 actually but i think he 's a little bit wide of the mark saying it 's the cause of a lot of concussions , ' said @entity0			2
' by virtue of the tackle itself you have to cool your jets a bit and wrap a bit more to get under the ball , so you actually have less heat in the collision to actually affect it properly			0
' when you do a lot of chop tackles there 's a danger there where you can get hit by knees and hips as well , so the baseline for us , we just try to coach as good technique as we can in whatever tackle we use			2
@entity0 has rejected @entity4 coach @entity3 ' ( pictured ) claims the technique is ' very dangerous ' ' it 's one of the forms of tackle we have , we try to vary it up in a tactical sense as well , and a lot of clubs and countries are using it now as an effective weapon			1
' but i do n't think you can overuse it , and that 's where @entity55 have been quite astute as well to mix up how they do use it			0
' but i do n't agree that it 's a dangerous form of tackle that 's for sure			0

@entity0 rejected @entity3 claim that choke tackle is dangerous
@entity6 assistant coach kiss devised the technique in 2011
he defended the right for his side to use it ahead of @entity55 clash
