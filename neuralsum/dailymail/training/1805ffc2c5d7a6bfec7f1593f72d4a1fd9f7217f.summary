@entity0 has long been lauded for his motivational skills in charge of @entity3 - and whatever he said to his charges at half time against @entity6 certainly did the trick as they ran out 5 - 0 winners with five second - half goals			1
@entity3 were sluggish in the first half at the @entity12 but eventually ran out big winners to put them in a great position to qualify from @entity15 at the half - way stage			1
@entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 all scored after the break to give them six points from their first two games			1
@entity20 leaps into the air at the @entity12 to celebrate his goal - a fourth of five second half strikes for @entity3 @entity19 attempts to cheer up his manager @entity0 after his goal made it 3 - 0 to @entity3 on the night @entity17 had broken the deadlock early in the second half after a poor opening period from last season 's runners - up @entity39 midfielder @entity17 ( left ) celebrates his goal with team - mate @entity40 ( right ) at the @entity12 @entity3 : @entity41 ; @entity20 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 ; @entity45 , @entity17 , @entity46 ; @entity19 ( @entity47 72 ) , @entity18 ( @entity21 77 ) , @entity40 ( @entity48 68 )			1
unused subs : @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53			0
goals : @entity17 48 , @entity18 61 , @entity19 63 , @entity20 87 , @entity21 90			1
booked : @entity20 @entity6 : @entity55 ; @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 ( @entity60 90 ) , @entity61 ; @entity62 ( @entity63 87 ) , @entity64 , @entity65 ( @entity66 66 ) ; @entity67 , @entity68			0
unused subs : @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73			0
booked : @entity61 , @entity67			0
but the first half was a different story , with dead ball opportunities uncharacteristically wasted and @entity19 hitting the bar when clean through			0
@entity0 looking frustrated on the touchline			0
the second period was a different story though , and @entity17 unlocked the @entity83 side 's defence to break the deadlock within three minutes of the restart after latching onto @entity40 's cross			1
summer signings @entity18 and @entity19 scored a quick - fire double after the hour mark			0
@entity90 turned in a cross with a poacher 's finish , then @entity19 was perhaps a little lucky to see his shot take a touch off the keeper before dropping just under the crossbar and into the back of the net and captain @entity20 added the fourth when he headed home a corner with three minutes left			2
@entity21 made it five in injury time , knocking home his own rebound from a curling effort to add even more gloss to the result			2
that result leaves @entity3 on six points in the group , although they sit behind @entity112 on their head - to - head record despite a five - goal superior goal difference , with the @entity116 still to travel to @entity117			1
@entity118 and @entity6 sit three points behind that pair in what is one of the tightest groups in the @entity124 at the half - way stage			2
@entity3 face @entity126 in @entity127 on sunday - a game that should pose a good opportunity to gain ground on their main title rivals with @entity117 and @entity133 meeting in @entity134			0
@entity18 celebrates his goal as @entity3 put themselves in a strong position to qualify from a tough @entity15 @entity21 , a late substitute , added the fifth and final goal of the night , turning in his own rebound with a curling effort			2

@entity3 *struggled* to break down their *stubborn* @entity83 **opponents** in the first half in @entity3
but goals from @entity17 , @entity145 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 made it a rout
@entity3 have six points to *top* @entity15 , just behind @entity112 on their head - to - head record
last year 's runners - up are three points clear of @entity155 champions @entity118 and *wednesday* 's **opponents**
