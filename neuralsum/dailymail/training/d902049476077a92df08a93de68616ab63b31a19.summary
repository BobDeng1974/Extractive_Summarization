by @entity0 @entity1 succumbed to their lowest one - day score in five years as a pathetic 102 all out helped @entity4 claim a seven - wicket victory in the series decider in @entity7			1
the tourists were badly let down by their batsmen as they were dismissed for their worst total in @entity4 in 32.1 overs , with just three batsmen reaching double figures and only @entity14 showing any sort of resolve in his 38 not out			1
@entity17 took four lower - order wickets but @entity1 's batsmen only had themselves to blame for their calamity before @entity4 comfortably knocked off the runs with a whopping 178 balls to spare , thanks to @entity24 's unbeaten 50 , as they clinched the series 2 - 1			1
high five ! @entity4 players celebrate after sealing a 2 - 1 one - day series victory over @entity1 seventh heaven : @entity24 hit an unbeaten 50 to help @entity4 win by seven wickets not good enough : @entity1 players leave the field after their lowest one - day total for five years read em and weep : the total of 102 was @entity1 's worst ever one - day total against @entity4 their task was made ever so slightly easier as heavy rain meant the contest was reduced to 48 overs per side and @entity4 's victory target narrowed down to 101			1
@entity24 settled into his stride with three crunching fours in the second over as @entity4 's opening stand put on 46 to all but ensure the win			0
@entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 were all dismissed but @entity24 led the way , taking @entity4 past their victory target in the 19th over with his ninth four that also brought up his half - century			0
but @entity4 were earlier grateful for the type of implosion only usually reserved for @entity1 , who chose to bat after winning the toss			0
bowled over : @entity17 took four low order wickets s @entity1 capitulated in dramatic fashion one man team : @entity14 was the only @entity1 batsman to reach double figures @entity65 's off ! @entity4 's @entity66 dives to take a catch to dismiss @entity1 batsman @entity68 @entity69 removed openers @entity70 and @entity72 , and @entity1 had lost their top three batsmen before the eighth over when @entity66 had @entity75 trapped in front by an inswinger that would have gone on to clip leg stump			1
@entity1 's efforts were further undermined when captain @entity80 found himself well short of his ground after attempting a quick single - with @entity83 ' throw from point condemning his opposite number to the third run - out in his last seven innings			0
@entity68 's needless slash to mid-on gave @entity17 the first of his four scalps , while @entity92 fell in characteristic fashion , caught on the off - side aiming a big heave off @entity96			0
champions ! @entity4 captain @entity98 ( c ) celebrates with his teammates and the trophy an hour 's rain delay meant @entity4 had to wait to polish off their opponents but there was to be no wag in the tail from @entity1 , with @entity14 left stranded following a resolute 73 - ball innings that contained three fours			2
