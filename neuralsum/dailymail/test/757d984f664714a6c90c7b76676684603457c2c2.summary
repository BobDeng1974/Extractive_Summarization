a highly capable , ruftytufty 4x4 from @entity9 — for a fraction of the price of a new @entity5 .
it 's a *confident* *charmer* that *stands* out from the *crowd* , with high *suspension* , pressed steel *wheels* , @entity12 - style looks and real *rarity* value . expect to get *gawped* at : someone **offered** to *buy* mine on its second trip out . always *fun* .
now available in the @entity69 from @entity0 *imports* through its *dealer* , @entity70 , in @entity72 , @entity73 ( *01536* *202207* , *lada4x4.co.uk* ) .
on the road , the basic *1.7* - litre **petrol** engine ( your only **option** ) is *deafeningly* *noisy* , but *tolerably* *smooth* . *power* *steering* , manageable *dimensions* and a tight *turning* circle make it reasonably *practical* for the *supermarket* or *school* run .
the seats are comfy and thanks to a high driving position and large wing *mirrors* , all - round *visibility* is good . top *speed* is *91* *mph* .
off - road , the @entity14 is in its **element** , with low and **highrange** gears , *differential* lock and a *sturdy* *monocoque* *construction* . it is lighter and more *sprightly* in the mud than many big - name **utility** 4x4s , with *220mm* *ground* *clearance* , a *600mm* wading depth and a *climbing* *ability* of up to *58* per cent . tall , *slender* tyres give it an added *advantage* when *things* get mucky .
you wo ***n't*** have to *agonise* over pages of *extras* *...* they *'re* more or less *nonexistent* . this is a very basic **utility** *vehicle* , after all .
choose in white , blue , *green* or red , then *decide* whether you *'d* like the *snorkel* or snow *plough* ( really ) *attachments* . an @entity120 **option** is available for an extra £ *999* — but you lose boot *space* .
*reasonable* fuel *economy* at *33mpg* and *affordable* to *insure* — once you *'ve* *explained* exactly what it is . meets @entity129 5 *emissions* **standard*s* . the *heated* *blower* , presumably *designed* with @entity131 in mind , has *plenty* of *muscle* for *icy* *winter* *mornings* .
also available in a compact van format ( £ 10,590 , excluding vat and road tax ) .
*spartan* on the inside . forget luxuries such as *radios* , *cup* - *holders* , *central* *locking* and *electric* *windows* — the @entity0 is an unabashed frills - free zone . the upside of its simplicity is that the plastic interior is easy to mop down after a day in the mud , and there 's not much to break or go *wrong* .
there are only four *seatbelts* and a *slightly* *pokey* boot .
do ***n't*** trust the **petrol** *gauge* , which *regularly* aims to *deceive* .
no *warranty* is **offered** as *standard* — although a two - year plan is coming soon — and *spares* may need to be *imported* ( @entity70 will *assist* ) .
only available in *lefthand* drive — unless you *put* in an order for more than 500 of them !
shhhh ! you did ***n't*** hear it from me . but patriotic @entity9 president @entity40 made a big play of driving a @entity0 back in 2009 — but fitted it with a @entity43 engine .
