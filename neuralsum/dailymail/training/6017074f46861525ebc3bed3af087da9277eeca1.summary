i did n't think the chance would come			0
' i know how big @entity0 are - and it means everything to me - but i know what is important ; i know it 's what i do on the pitch and the minutes i play			1
i know that 's what matters , and that 's what i 'll be focused on			0

international duty : @entity2 ( right ) heads to @entity3 's team plan on sunday before flying out to @entity72 ' i 've seen @entity2 over the years and he 's one of those players that probably never got the recognition for what a really good footballer he is , ' @entity61 said			1
' it 's only late on in his career - at 29 , 30 , 31 - that people are really starting to focus on his qualities			0
' he was probably seen as the traditional big no 9 , a @entity84 striker that is good in the air			0
' but he 's one of the most accomplished footballers i 've seen			0
' it has been so refreshing that he 's got his call into the @entity3 team , and he certainly has n't let anyone down - he has been outstanding			1
formalities : @entity2 revealed that his medical had gone well on sunday will @entity2 be a success at @entity0 ? will @entity2 be a success at @entity0 ? now share your opinion ' look at his touch , look at the level of his goals , the different types of goals he has scored over his career , and he 's a specialist on penalties as well			1
' i think he is a terrific footballer and any team he plays against , he 's always a handful			0
' the initial rejection by @entity0 hit @entity2 hard , as he admitted earlier in the season : ‘ i was at @entity0 from age 10 to 15 and i was basically told i was n’t good enough , which obviously was a hard thing to take at the time			1
' i thought it was the end of the world			0
but i can tell people in the same situation that it is not the end of the world			0
it should drive you on to succeed even more			0
