@entity0 will sport a newly - designed crest when they move to the @entity2 from the start of the 2016 - 17 season			1
the @entity0 conducted a number of online polls amongst supporters to garner opinions on a modern , simplistic design to coincide with the move away from @entity11 in two years ' time - with a slight majority voting in favour of the change			1
the new crest sees the castle removed from the current design , with ' @entity18 ' added in an attempt to attract a wider market as the club made a number of small alterations following feedback from fans			1
' of the two supporter polls , @entity36 reported that 77 per cent of fans were supportive of evolving the @entity39 's crest			0
@entity39 therefore had a clear mandate for change			0
when presented with the new crest 's design , 72 per cent of @entity0 fans who support change , also voted to adopt the new crest design			1
' @entity36 's report confirmed that the second stage of the process attracted new respondents and new opinions , while the results showed that an overall 56 per cent majority of fans voted ' yes ' , in clear support of adopting the new crest			0
legends : the likes of @entity60 ( above ) and @entity61 ( below ) have worn the famous crossed hammers ' the primary , full - colour flat and mono executions ... will be the most widely used and will grace the playing shirt from 2016			0
we are also pleased to report that the popular blue shield with claret hammers will be adopted as a secondary colour - way			0
' the new crest is another step away from tradition for the east @entity18 club who will leave the @entity11 , their home for the last 110 years , to take up anchor residency of the @entity2 in @entity78			1
co-chairmen @entity79 and @entity81 issued a statement thanking supporters for their input , which read : ' as a board , we always put the fans ' feelings at the heart of our decision making			2
this is an emotive issue and we have said from the outset that if supporters did not vote for this crest then there would be no change			1
new home : the change of badge will coincide with @entity0 's 2016 move to the @entity2 evolution : the current badge , as seen on new signing @entity103 , is the 15th version of the crest ' from all the emails and tweets we have seen , there are clearly thousands of different opinions out there			1
but ultimately , the fans have spoken			0
we are pleased to have found a route that has been endorsed by the majority of fans so we now plan to follow that guidance			0
' meanwhile vice-chairman @entity118 , who played a major part in securing the @entity2 move , believes the tie - in with a new crest is crucial to develop the club			2
new look : the two shades of claret are a graphical representation of the @entity129 's bow , the inspiration behind the new crest shape changing times : the proposed badge will be the 16th evolution of the @entity0 crest ' our priority now is to continue to work with supporters to ensure that when we make our momentous move in 2016 , the @entity2 looks and feels like home			1
' this has always been and remains a guiding principle for the board in the lead up to the move			0
millions of pounds are being invested to make sure the stadium exceeds fans ' expectations come the first game of the 2016 - 17 season			2
' the approval of the new crest is a significant step forward in this process and i would like to reiterate my thanks to the thousands of supporters who played their part in helping to devise what will be the 16th crest in our 119 - year history			2
