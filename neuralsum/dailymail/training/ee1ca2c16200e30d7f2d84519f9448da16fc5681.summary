deposed : @entity0 was removed as @entity2 's prime minister in a @entity4 coup whose details have just been revealed for the first time today marks the 60th anniversary of the coup in @entity2 which deposed prime minister @entity9 after he restricted the flow of oil to the @entity12			1
however , it is only now , six decades on , that the @entity4 has finally admitted that it was behind the revolution , which was one of the most significant landmarks in modern @entity2 history			2
it has long been widely acknowledged that the @entity20 and @entity21 authorities were behind @entity9 's overthrow - one factor behind the anti-western sentiments shared by many in @entity2 which led to the 1979 @entity26 revolution in the country			1
however , the @entity4 has never publicised its role in the operation , claiming that it needs to maintain secrecy in order to protect its working methods and sources of information			2
but today the agency released documents to the @entity37 in which it admits that the coup ' was carried out under @entity4 direction as an act of @entity20 foreign policy '			1
the operation , codenamed ' @entity43 ' , was ' conceived and approved at the highest levels of government ' , the documents - entitled ' @entity47 ' and compiled in the 1970s - reveal			0
the agency admits that the coup , which saw the @entity50 persuaded to sack @entity9 and replace him with @entity51 , was a ' last resort ' and a ' policy of desperation '			2
it took place on august 19 , 1953 , after negotiations between @entity21 and @entity2 over securing @entity21 access to @entity2 oil broke down			1
populist : @entity9 alienated the @entity12 by nationalising @entity2 's oil supplies which were controlled by @entity21 @entity62 is thought to have asked the @entity4 to remove @entity9 and install a @entity12 leader , and the @entity20 authorities readily agreed as a way of getting the upper hand over the @entity66 in the @entity67			1
the internal dossier says : ' it was the potential of those risks to leave @entity2 open to @entity66 aggression that compelled the @entity20 in planning and executing @entity43			2
' one alternative possibility was a unilateral invasion of @entity2 by @entity21 forces , similar to the @entity75 invasion of @entity76 during the @entity78 crisis three years later			0
however , that prospect was apparently unacceptable to the @entity20 , as it would lead to a @entity66 backlash and the @entity12 would permanently lose access to @entity2 's oil supply			2
coup : soldiers and tanks stand in the streets of @entity86 after the deposition of @entity9 in august 1953 historic : the coup led to a strong @entity91 legacy in @entity2 , culminating in the 1979 @entity93 revolution @entity9 was elected as prime minister of iran in april 1951 , and quickly set about opposing the @entity21 authorities who had long dominated the @entity98 country			1
around the time he came to power , the @entity2 parliament voted to nationalise the @entity102 , taking the country 's oil supply into its own hands			0
@entity21 fiercely opposed this move , and opted to blockade @entity2 in order to prevent it from selling its oil to anyone else			0
this put severe strain on the national finances , but the fiercely patriotic @entity9 refused to back down and set about shoring up his power			0
the @entity4 and @entity62 managed to persuade the @entity50 , @entity50 , to support @entity51 as a replacement prime minister at the head of a military junta			1
they orchestrated street protests and arranged a national propaganda campaign which led to @entity9 's downfall on august 19 , 1953			1
the deposed leader was sentenced to three years in prison , then spent the rest of his life under house arrest before dying in 1967			0
the @entity50 , emboldened by his newfound power , became an autocratic leader who ruled the country with an iron fist until his downfall in the @entity93 revolution			0
' the @entity66 army would have moved south to drive @entity21 forces out on behalf of their @entity2 " allies " , ' the @entity4 documents say			0
' then not only would @entity2 's oil have been irretrievably lost to the @entity12 , but the defence chain around the @entity66 which was part of @entity20 foreign policy would have been breached			0
' they continue : ' under such circumstances , the danger of a third world war seemed very real			0
' although the coup was extremely successful in the short term , with @entity9 being swiftly removed and imprisoned , its long - term effects were less positive			1
the @entity20 intervention in @entity2 's internal politics created a strong strain of anti-american sentiment in the country , which culminated in the hostage crisis following the @entity93 revolution of 1979			0
the @entity21 's involvement in the coup - which has never been officially recognised - also created a backlash within @entity2 , with many regarding @entity21 with even more hostility than they do the @entity20 the newly released @entity4 documents acknowledge these ill effects , stating the the coup is regarded by many observers as being ' near the top of their list of infamous @entity167 acts '			1
while the @entity4 itself has never previously alluded to its role in carrying out the coup , officials as senior as @entity169 and @entity170 have acknowledged that the operation had @entity20 backing			1
it is unclear why intelligence chiefs have now decided to own up to the true origins of the coup			0
secret : this @entity4 document from the 1970s reveals the agency 's role in overthrowing @entity9			2

@entity9 was deposed in a military coup on august 19 , 1953
@entity4 and @entity62 have long been thought to have orchestrated the operation
but today @entity20 officials admitted *responsibility* for the first time ever
