it barely touched @entity26 at @entity21 on sunday and the @entity14 substitute had only been on the pitch for five minutes , but that did n’t deter him from braving the biting north - west air			2
@entity13 strikes a shirtless pose in front of @entity14 fans after his winner at @entity21 the @entity14 winger admitted he has never removed his shirt before but got caught up in the moment the @entity36 was unsurprisingly shown a yellow card under @entity39 regulations @entity13 is joining a muscle - bound band of brothers , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 among those never shy to showcase their upper body			1

’ @entity110 sensation @entity44 ( right ) reveals his muscular torso after scoring against @entity112 @entity113 international @entity86 lives up to his namesake by striking a pose usually associated with a green superhero @entity112 striker @entity117 shows he may need more gym time to keep up with his contemporaries @entity120 flexes his muscles after scoring in @entity123 's 3 - 1 win against @entity124 @entity125 could n't resist getting semi-naked in front of the @entity127 after scoring for @entity128 in 2010 @entity42 ’s explosion from the skinny teenager at @entity124 to the ripped superstar of @entity132 has been well documented — it is said he does more than 1,000 sit - ups each day			1
and @entity56 admits no player is born with a six - pack			2

’ but not every top footballer boasts a beach bod			0
leather points to @entity188 ’s @entity187			0
‘ look at @entity187 — his body is very slight and he ’s all about a low centre of gravity , ’ he said			0
