a team of firefighters helped to rescue @entity6 from the top of the spiral staircase the solution ? a team of specialist firemen more used to rescuing climbers from cliff tops and rock faces – who embarked on an elaborate mission that involved opening a trap - door in the belfry floor and winching mrs @entity6 to the ground 20ft below			1
mrs @entity6 , who works as a typist , said : ‘ i do n’t remember very much at all , i started pulling the bells and the next thing i knew i was looking at a paramedic			2
‘ i have no real memory of it at all			0
i have no memory of being caught up			0
i think i hit my head on the wall and then fell over and hit it on the floor – it was n’t that exciting			2
the exciting bit was being rescued by all the firemen			0
‘ it ’s just been quite a drama i think trying to get me out – the actual accident was n’t much , but trying to get me out of where i was was quite difficult			0
’ paramedics who arrived at @entity46 in @entity47 , near @entity48 , initially thought mrs @entity6 had broken her hip and gave her morphine – but she received a clean bill of health after a hospital examination			1
rescue : a total of 19 firefighters - including specialists more typically called out to rescue rock climbers in difficulty - attended the scene at the church in @entity47 a trapdoor in the gallery floor was lifted out so firefighters could lower the 58 - year - old through the gap to safety precarious : the bell - ringer was strapped to a stretcher and passed from the confined gallery at the top of the belfry to a waiting firefighter on a ladder mrs @entity6 , from @entity48 , has only been bell - ringing for three months and took up the hobby after a neighbour suggested she come along to the weekly group sessions			1
‘ i just like the church bells , i ’ve always liked hearing them , so i thought i ’d have a go , ’ she said , adding she would ‘ have to see ’ whether she would be going back to the belfry any time soon			0
tower captain @entity81 , 79 , was one of five bell - ringers who were there when mrs @entity6 fell			1
' i started pulling the bells and the next thing i knew i was looking up at a paramedic ' @entity6 he said : ‘ it all happened so quickly			2
she was unconscious for a while , and two of our ringers , who are qualified medically , quickly got down with her and tried to revive her quickly and start talking to her			0
‘ at the same time the ambulance was called and then it was a case of keeping her warm on the floor , because she was very cold and the colour had drained from her face			0
everybody was just sitting around very worried , not quite knowing what to do , but left the two that did know what they were doing to carry on			0
‘ she was learning to ring , had just started , and then this happened			0
’ reverend @entity108 said mr @entity81 had been training bell - ringers for many years and that nothing like the incident on monday evening had ever happened before			0
careful : ms @entity6 's stretcher was attached to specially designed ropes before being guided to the ground by firefighters , who spent over an hour getting the woman to safety the inside of the tower at @entity120 in @entity47 , near @entity48 he said : ‘ it ’s not nice when it happens and it ’s a reminder that bell - ringing is a very skilled hobby and there needs to be careful training on it			1
’ the clergyman added that he was pleased with how the rescue went and praised the emergency services for doing a ‘ brilliant ’ job			0
he said : ‘ @entity6 was only really aware of the number of people involved when she got to the bottom and was wheeled out			2
’ the nine firemen from @entity48 who initially attended called in a specialist team of 11 from @entity137 , who usually deal with rescues from rock faces			2
ms @entity6 had been attending bell - ringing sessions for three months at the picturesque church the typist joked that she may think twice about returning to bell - ringing after her experience an @entity146 spokesman said : ‘ the local woman took off with the rope and she got knocked around in the process			1
‘ there is a small trap door and the only way she could have come down was through the trap door – the staircase was so narrow we would n’t have managed to bring her down through that on a stretcher			2
‘ the woman was safely lowered about 20ft to the ground , where she was taken into the care of ambulance staff who took her to hospital			1
