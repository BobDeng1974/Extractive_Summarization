by @entity0 published : 10:55 est , 30 march 2013 updated : 10:56 est , 30 march 2013 two versions of @entity4 's iconic @entity3 painting will be reunited when they are displayed alongside each other for the first time			1
in a rare loan , the copy of @entity3 owned by the @entity8 in @entity9 will be put on show side - by - side with the @entity13 original in the @entity14 this year			1
next year the @entity9 copy with travel for the first time to the @entity17 in @entity13			1
the sunflower on the left , the @entity13 version , is painted with rougher strokes than the @entity14 version on the right , which was painted five months later the first piece was one of four created at @entity26 , in the south of @entity28 , in august 1888 while the second was one of three ' repetitions ' @entity4 produced in january 1889			2
they have been displayed together in public only once before in 2001 , as part of a joint exhibition between the @entity8 and @entity35			1
only five of the series are on show to the public , the others are at @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , the @entity44 at the @entity45 and at the @entity46 in @entity47			1
these galleries rarely allow their versions to travel , but the @entity51 and @entity14 galleries have agreed to mark the end a ten - year research project by the @entity8 , which is also celebrating its 40th anniversary			1
@entity55 , director of the @entity14 museum , said : ' the biggest outcome of the [ research project ] is that we can counter a common perception about @entity4 - that he was mad , that he attacked the canvas and worked in a manic way and just cranked out these works			1
' what the research has shown is that he worked very carefully			2
he had a huge repertoire of works that he had seen in galleries kept in his head			1
@entity71 captured @entity4 at the easel painting sunflowers , a subject the @entity14 artist rendered many times ' he approached his art - making in a very methodical way			2
that 's quite different from common perceptions of him as the artist who madly throws paint at the canvas			2
' visitors will be able to see the changes that @entity4 introduced in the @entity9 copy , which is brighter and features a sunflower with blue seeds			1
the differences betray a fundamental change in the artist 's approach , an expert at the museum said			1
@entity93 , a senior researcher at the @entity8 , told @entity94 that the @entity13 original was intended as a radical work to impress @entity71 , with whom @entity4 wished to collaborate			1
a self portrait by @entity4 who painted a series of @entity3 that are on show around the world ' the first one was meant to be simply a statement by @entity4 to show @entity104 that he was able to join the modern art movement as @entity71 had , ' he said			1
' it 's what you would call a primitive kind of idea of sunflowers			2
' the @entity9 copy , created after @entity104 had left @entity26 , had an entirely different purpose			1
the flowers became symbols of the artists ' shared time in @entity26 , so rather than emphasise them wilting he made them bold and bright			0
' he wanted the flowers to shine like candles , so what you see in our picture is that he is changing his mind , adjusting the meaning of the painting			0
' the @entity17 's painting was bought for the nation in 1924 for £ 1,308			0
the copy now held in @entity133 bought by @entity133 insurance magnate @entity134 at @entity136 in 1987 for a then - record £ 25million			2
the price was over four times the previous record of about $ 12million paid for @entity141 's @entity140 in 1985			0
the record was broken a few months later with the purchase of another @entity4 , @entity144 , by @entity145 for $ 53.9million at @entity146 , @entity147 on november 11 , 1987			0
@entity4 intended to decorate @entity71 's room with these paintings in the so - called @entity150 that he rented in @entity26 in the south of @entity28			0
@entity152 and @entity71 worked there together between october and december 1888			0
@entity4 wrote to his brother @entity154 in august 1888 , ' i am hard at it , painting with the enthusiasm of a @entity159 eating bouillabaisse , which wo n't surprise you when you know that what i 'm at is the painting of some sunflowers			0
' if i carry out this idea there will be a dozen panels			0
so the whole thing will be a symphony in blue and yellow			0
i am working at it every morning from sunrise on , for the flowers fade so quickly			0
' i am now on the fourth picture of sunflowers			0
this fourth one is a bunch of 14 flowers ... it gives a singular effect			0
' the dying flowers are built up with thick brushstrokes ( impasto )			0
the impasto evokes the texture of the seed - heads			0
@entity4 produced the replica of this painting , now held in @entity9 , in january 1889 , and perhaps another one later in the year			1
the various versions and replicas remain much debated among @entity4 scholars .			2

copy owned by museum in @entity9 will be displayed with original
versions of @entity3 displayed together in public only once , in 2001
loans between galleries , which almost never allow them to travel , are rare
