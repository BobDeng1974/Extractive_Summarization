the newest @entity1 polygamous family featured in a reality tv show says sharing their story with a wide audience has been liberating			1
@entity5 and his five wives were a bit apprehensive ahead of the airing of a pilot episode in september , but they said this week an interview with the @entity11 that it felt liberating to be open about who they are and what they believe			1
' it really is like coming out of the closet , ' said @entity5 , 43			1
' it 's very liberating			2
' @entity5 poses with his wives , from left to right , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , and @entity24 , outside of their home in a polygamous community outside @entity27 his wives feel the same way , including his second , @entity30 , 40 , who said : ' i feel more free to just be who i am and not be so afraid			2
' the first of nine episodes of the show , ' my five wives , ' airs sunday on @entity36			0
it chronicles the life of @entity5 , his five wives and their 24 children who live in a small rural community outside of @entity27 dominated by a branch of the fundamentalist mormon church			2
the family once belonged to the group , known as the @entity45 , but withdrew during the mid- 2000s after re-evaluating their core beliefs			0
now , they practice polygamy not because they think they must to get to heaven , and avoid hell , but because they prefer the lifestyle			0
their show begins airing in a social and political climate that has softened significantly toward plural families in recent years			1
a federal judge in @entity1 struck down key parts of the state 's polygamy laws in december , marking a victory for the @entity5 and hundreds of other polygamous families in the state			1
the ruling decriminalizes polygamy , making only bigamy — holding marriage licenses with multiple partners — illegal			0
@entity5 five wives , from left to right , @entity21 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity22 and @entity20 , pose for a photograph outside of their home in a polygamous community outside @entity27 the family that brought that lawsuit against the state of @entity1 , @entity80 and his four wives from @entity36 's " @entity80 , " is credited with helping create greater acceptance for plural families			1
their show , which debuted in 2010 with footage of the family at their house in northern @entity1 , was ground - breaking in demonstrating to viewers across the country that not all polygamists are child predators like @entity93 , the imprisoned leader of a polygamous sect on the @entity1 - @entity96 border			1
the @entity5 family members said they do n't expect viewers to be surprised by much , other than maybe how similar they are to non-polygamous families			1
it 's normal times five , the family jokes			0
viewers will see tears , joy and quarrels , they said			0
@entity36 is banking on viewers being fascinated by the unique dynamics of a plural family : regular family sit - down meetings among the adults where @entity5 follows an agenda written on a notepad ; side - by - side multiplexes where they live ; and nightly family dinners where the children line up like kids in a school cafeteria to get their food			1
@entity5 talks while his wives , from left to right , @entity21 , @entity20 , @entity22 , @entity23 , and @entity24 , look on during an interview at their home in a polygamous community outside @entity27 then there 's the always - intriguing dynamic among the wives who share a husband			2
in the first episode , @entity5 suggests the women work out their issues directly with one another rather than always coming to him , only to see it lead to hurt feelings and shouting			2
among the topics discussed by the family during the season is a possible move out of @entity1 , maybe even to @entity141			0
the @entity142 of ' @entity80 ' fled @entity1 for @entity143 after their show aired under the threat of prosecution from a county official			0
the @entity5 are n't terribly worried about that happening to them , as long as the recent court ruling stands			1
but they say they do n't feel welcomed in the tight - knit community where almost everyone but them belongs to the church			0
' there have n't been any overt acts of disapproval , ' @entity5 said			2
but he added : ' we want to be able to feel comfortable in our own skin			0
' @entity161 , a principal at the school in the community and member of the @entity45 , said he does n't begrudge the @entity5 family for doing the show			1
he said the production crews have been respectful , and he 's heard no complaints from the @entity5 family 's neighbors			1
' if they want to go public with what they believe , it 's their choice , ' @entity161 said			0
' it 's not something i would choose to do with my family			0
it 's a rocky road			0

' it really is like coming out of the closet , ' said @entity5 , 43 . ' it 's very liberating '
