by @entity0 published : 08:59 est , 1 november 2012 updated : 08:59 est , 1 november 2012 with its vivid interplay of emerald and amethyst hues , this remarkable image could almost be a precious stone growing deep within the bowels of the @entity6			1
in fact it shows a virus replicating and spreading through cells , destroying them as it goes			1
the picture was captured by researchers from the @entity15 , @entity16 , using a technique that also helps calculate the level of infectious virus present in cells			1
invasion : this remarkable image shows a vaccinia virus spreading from a single infected cell through an entire layer of monkey kidney cells ' the image shows vaccinia virus , the live - virus vaccine used to eradicate smallpox , spreading from a single infected cell through an entire layer of monkey kidney cells , ' said dr @entity32			1
he and @entity33 , a phd student from his laboratory at the university 's @entity35 , collaborated with scientists from the @entity38 to create the image			1
it is part of dr @entity32 's research on understanding the role of viral genes in viral biology and the effect that mutating these genes has on the viruses ' ability to cause disease			1
the image , which was featured in the prestigious @entity50 as part of their @entity52 , is titled ' @entity54 '			1
scientists investigating the spread of cancer cells have surgically implanted windows into the bellies of live mice			1
the glass portholes stitched directly into the rodents ' abdominal walls are intended to help researchers track how cancer cells spread to form secondary tumours			1
this process , known as tumour metastasis , is currently not not well understood , however the lethal dispersal of these cells is the cause of most cancer - related deaths			1
the gruesome method has been pioneered by @entity75 and his colleagues at the @entity77 and @entity78 in @entity79 , the @entity80			2
they surgically removed a section of a mouse 's abdominal wall and replaced it with a tiny glass pane about half an inch wide surrounded by a biocompatible titanium ring			2
tightly stitched to the skin and abdominal wall , the windows reportedly did not impair the rodents ' movements and they caused no signs of infection and inflammation			2
however , in just over one in 50 cases the glass panes did break , with presumably grisly consequences			2
the name that dr @entity32 and mr @entity33 chose is intended to convey the sense of seeing the starting point of the viral activity in the cells			2
' the image is actually a composite of several smaller images taken in the microscope facility in the @entity35 , ' said mr @entity33			0
' to create them we work with the ideal dilution of highly concentrated virus so that only a few cells are infected			0
that allows us to monitor the spread of the virus through the uninfected cell layer			0
' three days after the initial infection , the cells are chemically fixed , creating a snapshot of the infection at this stage , the researchers say			0
' we then use fluorescent chemicals to highlight the structures in the cell we want to concentrate on			0
in this case pink virus - infected cells , yellow dna and a turquoise skeleton , ' mr @entity127 added			0
viral plaques are patches of cells infected by viruses that have a distinctly different appearance because of cell death , movement or a change in cell structure			0
by counting the number of viral plaques in a layer of cells molecular bioscientists can figure out how much virus is circulating in a host or the concentration of viruses they work with in the laboratory			0
' the degree to which viruses change the appearance of cells they infect inside a plaque can help us understand how pathogenic the virus is , ' said mr @entity33			0
' this is a particularly beautiful technique used in our lab to discover whether the mutations we make in the virus affect their ability to cause disease			0
