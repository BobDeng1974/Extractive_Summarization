this is the moment that 15 - year - old @entity1 , from @entity2 in @entity3 , found his voice for the very first time			1
@entity1 , who was born deaf , was unable to even express himself to his family and , had things not changed , would have been condemned to a life of silence			1
but thanks to a pioneering new programme , he has finally been taught to communicate using sign language			1
but @entity1 has been lucky			0
his teacher is @entity26 who is deaf himself - and who is one of the few @entity3 to use sign language			1
' in the past i was also like him , ' he explains			0
' i could n’t use sign language , the only thing i could do was hide in fear			0
' @entity26 became deaf as a child after a bout of malaria but six months ago , he travelled to the @entity3 capital @entity2 for intensive training in sign language			1
now able to communicate with the outside world , @entity26 is determined to change the lives deaf people in @entity46 , many of whom have never been taught sign language			2
@entity26 has set up the first sign - language school in the area and convinced @entity1 to attend many of the pupils – aged from nine to 80 – have walked miles to attend @entity26 's course @entity26 , who stars in tonight 's episode of @entity55 , has also opened the very first sign language school in the country - which @entity1 now attends			1
but nothing is as heart - warming as the moment that @entity1 finally realises he can communicate , with joy spreading across his face as he grasps the significance of what he has learned			2
@entity1 's transformation is nothing short of breathtaking			0
in the space of just a few hours he goes from a hunched over terrified looking boy who can barely make eye contact to beaming and standing confidently in front of the class as they choose his new sign name			0
but @entity1 wo n't be the only deaf child to benefit			0
buoyed by the success of his first cohort of students , @entity26 hopes to take his school on tour and help many more children on the way			0
@entity83 to speak airs on @entity85 at 7.30pm , 21 november @entity1 lives an isolated existence in total silence , unable to communicate @entity26 who is deaf himself attempts to make a connection with @entity1 , but his fear is obvious			2
