intelligence chiefs have reportedly already supplied the government with information about the militant unit which is holding the remaining hostages , among them @entity21 photojournalist @entity51			2

it is senseless ; it 's completely unforgivable			0
anyone in any doubt about this organisation can now see how truly repulsive it is and barbaric it is as an organisation			0
' what we see with this organisation is that there is no level of depravity to which they will not sink			0
