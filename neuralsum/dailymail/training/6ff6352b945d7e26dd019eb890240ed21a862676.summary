the tumultuous history of @entity1 over the last millennium , including its many revolutions and wars , has been captured in a remarkable video lasting just over three minutes			1
from the @entity9 until modern times , the lines on the map of @entity1 have been redrawn many times and tell a tale of the rise and fall of nations including the creation of vast empires to small countries fighting for their independence			1
the hypnotic video shows the lines on the map of @entity1 subtlety changing over 1,012 years as a result of major historical events			1
the video , which contains animations and maps by the creator of the @entity43 , @entity44 , begins in the year 1140 at the end of the @entity46 and the beginning of the @entity9 ; a time when religiously - motivated military expeditions set up small states in the eastern @entity50			1
the expeditions culminated in the @entity52 in 1204 , which ended the @entity28			0
@entity1 in the 17th century , at the end of the @entity55			0
much of northern @entity1 is visibly carved up into tiny states and over a few hundred years there were many wars and revolutions the map shows how the @entity61 was dominated by the rise and fall of the @entity63 , which at its peak stretched from @entity65 to the @entity67 sea in @entity1 , with the @entity68 led by @entity69			1
while @entity72 fought with @entity73 in the @entity74 , beginning in 1337 , the @entity71 got stronger , @entity70 expanded southward and eastward into former @entity76 lands and the @entity77 also grew in size as it swallowed up former @entity28 lands over time			0
the @entity55 spread throughout @entity1 between the 14th and 17th centuries , but despite the beginning of what many people consider to be modern @entity1 and the proliferation of new artistic and scientific ideas , a number of religious wars and revolutions rocked the continent , changing boundaries between small states and countries			2
@entity1 in 1913 ahead of @entity93			0
@entity94 and @entity95 are unified nations but the boundaries between countries were set to change dramatically in just a short space of time between 1815 and 1871 , some @entity102 nations regained their independence from the @entity77 and after the @entity104 , @entity94 and @entity95 unified into nation states ahead of @entity93 , during which time , boundary changes in @entity1 were dramatic and rapid			2
following the war , the @entity107 altered the map of @entity1 and ultimately led to the outbreak of @entity111 , as nations were divided , radical politics was fueled by angry citizens and countries subsequently invaded as @entity1 entered a second state of flux with boundaries and areas of ocupation that changed in a short and violent period of time			1
since 1918 , when poverty triggered the @entity123 , the @entity124 had been growing and came to dominate the continent up to 1991 , when smaller @entity124 countries regained their independence			0
following two devastating world wars , @entity1 looks very different in 1960 with an occupied and divided @entity94 and the huge @entity124			0
at the height of the @entity129 , the ' iron curtain ' dividing communist and capitalist @entity1 is clearly visible on this map a map of @entity132			0
