we usually associate power cords with unsightly , tangled cables that need to be hidden away			1
but a group of @entity5 researchers believes everyday cables can be revolutionised using cheap sensors to perform complex tasks			1
their research could lead to radios that turn on by bending the cable , or lamps that switch off when its wires are kicked			2
a pull on the cord sends a request to for safe ejection of the device the technology is being developed by the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) as part of the ' @entity27 ' project			1
' everyone hates cables , ' @entity28 of @entity24 's @entity29 told @entity32			1
' every device has one , and yet we see them as a nuisance			0
we wanted to see if we could give cords additional meaning			0
' using a water hose for inspiration , the research team developed a five prototypes of ' super cables ' to demonstrate their abilities			1
using a water hose for inspiration , the research team developed a five prototypes of ' super cables ' to demonstrate their abilities the first of the prototypes was a lamp with the dimmer knob replaced by a knot on the cord ( top )			1
in another prototype , a clip clamping on the macbook charger wire was able to control a computer 's power function ( bottom left )			1
another cable ( bottom right ) allowed the user to pinch headphone to control the play function there seems to be a wave of chargers that promise to speed up the time it takes to fully charge a phone or tablet			1
the latest one , @entity77 , claims to halve the amount of time it takes to get a battery from zero to 100 per cent , it is available to pre-order for both @entity83 and @entity85 handsets			0
designed by a team from @entity88 , @entity89 , the @entity86 has two functions			2
when it ’s plugged into a device , but switched off , it acts like a standard usb cable and syncs content from one device to another			0
but , when it is switched on , the syncing functions are disabled so the cable concentrates all of its energy into charging the connected device			0
the @entity103 campaign features a graphic that shows the @entity105 charging a device twice as fast as a traditional charger			0
@entity105 comes with a @entity109 connector , for the @entity83 and later models , the fourth generation @entity112 and above , and the ipad mini range			0
it also has a @entity116 option that will work for @entity117 , @entity118 and other compatible devices , including @entity120			0
after the initial run of cables are shipped , they will retail for $ 36 ( £ 24 )			2
they are expected to be available sometime next month			0
each of the cords was controlled by either knotting , pinching , sensing pressure , bending or stretching			0
the first of the prototypes was a study lamp with the dimmer knob replaced by a knot on the cord			1
as the knot is tightened , embedded sensors and a micro-controller dims the light			2
in another prototype , a clip clamping on the macbook charger wire was able to control a computer 's power function , including sending it to sleep			1
it was able to do this because the charger cable , infused with pressure - sensitive sensors , sent a pulse that was detected by the computer			0
they embedded sensors that detect whether a knot has been tied in a cord , along with where and how tight it is to control a gadget , such as a lamp			1
the team also created headphones use special external woven fibres that detect touch and pressure			1
pinching the cord triggers the pause functionality of the @entity83 's 3.5mm jack			2
existing sensors were also used to help detect if a cable is being stretched too far			0
a final prototype involved a hard drive cable			2
a pull on the cord sends requests to the computer for safe ejection of the device			2
the scientists say most of the capabilities being explored in @entity177 would be cheap and easy for companies to incorporate into existing devices			0
' most of the presented interactions lend strongly from the metaphor of regarding the cord as a hose and the power and data as liquid flowing in that hose , ' they wrote in their paper			1
' cords offer endless possibilities of manual manipulation			0

cables have been *adapted* by @entity24 researchers as part ' @entity27 ' project
using a water hose as inspiration , the team developed five prototypes
one involved a lamp with the dimmer replaced by a knot on the cord
other prototypes involved kicking , pulling and twisting the power cables
the actions control gadgets such as @entity221 , *laptops* and headphones
