by @entity0 published : 17:45 est , 5 september 2013 updated : 18:11 est , 5 september 2013 they make up the most famous — and valuable — series of pictures in the history of art. in a staggering burst of creative energy , culminating in an agonising mental breakdown that led him to slice off his own ear , @entity6 produced a series of paintings of cut sunflowers in a vase			1
in total , there were seven different versions			1
the pictures are now scattered to the far corners of the world			1
missing link : this photograph of the destroyed second version was found in a @entity27 museum one , unseen in public since 1948 , is in the private collection of an unknown millionaire , revealed only to his closest friends			1
five others are in museums — in @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 ( bought for a world - record £ 25 million in 1987 ) and our own @entity40 in @entity42			1
but the seventh was destroyed during @entity45 called six sunflowers and painted in august 1888 , it had been in the collection of a wealthy collector , @entity48 , living on @entity27 ’s coast when his town was hit by an @entity52 bomb on august 6 , 1945 — coincidentally , the day the atomic bomb fell on @entity54			1
the painting , hanging over the sofa in @entity48 ’s sitting room , was obliterated			1
@entity48 managed to escape the raging firestorm , but his prized picture — with its heavy frame — was too cumbersome to carry			1
now , almost 70 years later , a @entity62 art historian has unearthed a colour photograph which reveals the work in all its glory			1
tortured : a self - portrait of @entity6 the print — with its vivid yellows , glowing oranges , citrus greens and royal blue background — gives us a rare glimpse of what the original might have looked like			1
art historian @entity76 stumbled on the photo while researching a book on the @entity80 series			1
as well as preserving @entity6 ’s original bold colours , it also shows the unusual , heavy , timber frame that was specially chosen by the artist			1
while most picture frames at the time were white , @entity6 chose an orange one to play against the orange of the sunflowers			1
with the rediscovery of the photograph of the seventh picture , the full story of the @entity91 at last falls into place			1
@entity6 painted them at a critical point in his life			1
aged 35 , he was less than two years from death , his career an unmitigated failure , his excitement at painting mingled with disappointment , sadness and self - destructive mania			1
before turning to painting , he had been an art dealer and teacher in @entity110 — in @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 — a bookseller in @entity115 , and a missionary in @entity117			1
those around him despaired of his prospects almost as much as he despaired of himself			1
in one letter , he angrily reported that his family wanted him to become a carpenter , accountant or baker			1
safe to say , the prospects of being a world - famous artist seemed remote			2
his romantic life was an equal disaster			2
when he proposed to the daughter of his @entity111 landlady , she refused because she was already engaged to a former lodger			2
the first version : @entity6 's initial painting is in a private collection a decade later , proposing to his widowed @entity140 cousin , she replied : ‘ @entity141 , neen , nimmer			2
’ ( ‘ no , nay , never			2
’ ) when she told him that he could n’t see her again , he thrust his hand into the flame of a light , saying to her father , his uncle : ‘ let me see her for as long as i can hold my hand in this flame			2
’ the desperate ploy did n’t work			2
a relationship with an alcoholic prostitute followed — and his romantic prospects were n’t improved by a bout of gonorrhoea in 1883			2
he is also thought to have contracted syphilis			2
nor were his violent mood swings helped by a poor diet , rich only in absinthe and tobacco			2
in february 1888 , he moved to @entity161 in @entity162 , seeking refuge from his misery and hoping the fresh air would alleviate his chronic smoker ’s cough			2
the third version ( left ) is in the @entity169 in @entity37 , while the fourth version ( right ) hangs in the @entity40 in @entity42 he signed a lease on the so - called @entity172 , which he was to immortalise in so many of his canvases , and started painting obsessively			1
and what obsessed him most were sunflowers			1
a letter written at the time from @entity6 to his art - dealer brother , @entity177 , survives			1
‘ i ’m painting with the gusto of a @entity180 eating bouillabaisse [ a local fish soup ] , ’ he wrote , ‘ which wo n’t surprise you when it ’s a question of painting large sunflowers			1
i ’d like to do a decoration for the studio			2
’ and so he began the pictures that would sell for millions — but not until after his death			2
during his lifetime , @entity6 was painfully aware of how unpopular his work was			2
in fact , he only ever sold one painting			0
two days after that first letter to @entity177 , he wrote another , saying : ‘ we live in times when there ’s no market for what we do ... i fear that it will scarcely change during our lifetime			0
’ @entity6 did n’t just have an exceptional talent			0
he was also astonishingly quick — the first four sunflower pictures were done in a week			0
but for all their golden , glowing colours , no one would buy them			0
a repeat of painting @entity213 3 ( left ) : on show at the @entity215 , and ( right ) a replica of number four ... now in @entity36 's @entity218 despairing , but not yet defeated , @entity6 continued working at a furious rate through the autumn of 1888			0
he painted a self - portrait , a picture of fellow artist @entity223 who was visiting him at @entity161 and several famous pictures of empty chairs			0
relations with @entity223 were stormy and @entity6 was terrified his friend might desert him , leaving him alone with his demons in @entity161			0
then came the blow that sent him off the rails for good			0
on december 23 , he received a letter from his adored brother , @entity177 , saying he was getting married			0
that very evening , he slashed off a chunk of his ear in an @entity161 brothel , handing it over , wrapped in newspaper , to a prostitute , asking her to ‘ keep this object carefully ’			0
it was n’t that @entity6 disliked his new sister - in - law , @entity241 , but he feared she would interfere with his close relationship with his brother			0
‘ @entity6 was worried about losing his brother ’s support , both emotional and financial , ’ art historian @entity76 writes in his new book			1
‘ and these fears played a key role in provoking his self - mutilation a few hours later			0
’ by january , @entity6 had recovered enough to leave hospital and paint three winter copies of his summer sunflower pictures			0
but the damage had been done and he entered a spiral of self - destruction			0
between february and may , he was in hospital again , suffering from hallucinations and paranoid fantasies that he was being poisoned			0
among local villagers he had acquired the nickname ‘ fou roux ’ , the mad redhead			0
final painting of version four : see it at @entity267 , @entity38 in may , he was moved to an asylum in nearby @entity162			0
he remained there for a year , sometimes seeming to recover his senses , at other times suffering crippling relapses			0
though his mind was tortured with visions and delusions , he continued to produce bold , ravishing canvases of the neighbouring olive groves , vineyards and cornfields			0
then , in july 1890 , two months after leaving the asylum , he shot himself in the stomach in @entity283 , north - west of @entity284			0
he chose to do it in the summer wheatfields — the landscape he had just been painting so memorably			0
two days later , he died in the @entity288 , the inn where he was lodging			0
biographers still debate the exact causes of @entity6 ’s acute mental condition			0
some say it was syphilis , which can induce symptoms of madness , others that it was manic depression or schizophrenia			0
whatever the cause , @entity6 ’s mental decline was certainly exacerbated by absinthe , acute anxiety , poverty and malnutrition			0
but through this fog of madness , @entity6 produced some of the most extraordinary paintings the world has ever seen			1
what is more remarkable still , is that these masterpieces came about quite by chance			0
one hot , breathless august day in @entity161 , the models @entity6 had engaged to sit for him failed to turn up and it was too stifling to consider taking his easel outside			0
so he cast his eye around the @entity172 for inspiration			0
seizing a handful of sunflowers , already wilting and curling in the heat , he arranged the blooms haphazardly in several green , cream and yellow earthenware pots			1
@entity76 imagines that the pots might have been just the sort of thing @entity6 would have ready in his studio as ‘ the ideal thing to put paintbrushes in ’			1
so , with his peasant pots and dying sunflowers , @entity6 produced seven paintings of astonishing brilliance			1
now , thanks to a @entity62 scholar ’s rediscovery of an image of @entity6 ’s lost masterpiece , we are once again able to admire them in all their end - of - summer glory			0
