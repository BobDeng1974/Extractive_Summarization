when @entity2 was caught looting the fridge for hot dogs , his owner decided this old dog needed to learn some new tricks			1
so in what looks like a bizarre tribute to @entity10 folk hero @entity7 , @entity11 got his canine companion to pose with a shiny red apple on top of his head , among other fruity treats			2
then he matched the color of the background to the fruit to create this series of eye - catching photos			0
do n't shoot ! @entity2 looks worried at the prospect this picture may be a preamble to some amateur archery sour grapes : the dog appears less than impressed with this set of headgear he 's been asked to balance on his snout by owner @entity11 for this series of quirky photograph superfoods for a super dog : @entity2 looks on inscrutably while balancing a mound of blueberries leaves a sour taste : @entity2 looks a little shocked after being persuaded to grip a lime in his jaws not impressed : but the loyal dog does n't flinch even with a slimy half - eaten banana balanced on his bonce anticipation : @entity2 looks like he better get something a little more meaty to justify all this posing ' @entity2 's very eager to please me and will do about anything for a treat			1
he absolutely loved doing these shots , ' mr @entity11 said			1
' he knew when we were about to do a shoot and would beat me to the room where i had it set up and be sitting in the exact spot i wanted before i got there			0
' naturally , he loved the fridge shoot too , being that he got to eat a whole package of hotdogs			2
' i kept replenishing the one you see him eating with a new one until we went through a package of them , just to make sure i got a good shot			0
' mr @entity11 , a tv repairman - cum - animal photographer from @entity69 , spent two months working with @entity2 to create the quirky shots			1
he had planned to just take a picture of the banana but after he got such a great reaction from people who saw the shots , he could not resist taking more			0
now there 's a snack i can sink my teeth into ... @entity2 got to scoff a whole packet of hotdogs for this picture mr @entity11 said : ' @entity2 does stick his nose in nearly every time i go to the fridge and open it and that is what gave me the idea , so luckily i never taught him how to open it to get me a beer or he would be in there a lot			1
' the pictures have been very well received and are some of my most popular ones			0
' most people love dogs and pictures of dogs done well with a wide angle lens tend to be popular			0
