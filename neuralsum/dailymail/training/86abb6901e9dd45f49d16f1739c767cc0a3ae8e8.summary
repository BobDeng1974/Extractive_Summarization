forget the mixed messages and crossed signals over exactly what went on between @entity4 and the @entity6 board over the course of another day of madness			2
none of that mattered come game night			2
none of it matters now			2
because this has to be the end			2
a final outing for a manager who , however difficult the circumstances , appears destined to fall short in the final push needed to get @entity6 back into the top flight			2
a third straight title should not have been beyond even this dysfunctional club , blessed with a huge support and run on the kind of voodoo economics that guaranteed @entity4 the second biggest budget in the land			2
@entity29 's @entity28 rifles his free - kick into the net to break the deadlock after one more underwhelming display and another damaging defeat , this to @entity29 in @entity35 , the task of guiding @entity6 — his @entity6 — to the @entity39 crown is clearly beyond the artist formerly known as @entity4			1
there appears to be nothing he can do to change it			2
no hint of a @entity45 no suggestion he and his team are about to turn a corner and go on the kind of scorching run needed to overtake @entity52			1
back at the ground where he scored his first ever goal for the club , in 1983 , @entity4 looked on in private torment as goals from @entity28 and @entity58 gave the @entity59 their first home win over @entity6 for 59 years			1
@entity62 ’s team might have won by more , as they picked holes in disorganised and demoralised opponents who , perhaps , could be forgiven for appearing confused at times			0
after all , they ’d probably expended a lot of emotional energy before a ball had been kicked			0
this was a match day like no other , the usual drag of hours and minutes until kick - off replaced by fevered speculation			1
would @entity4 even get on the team bus ? @entity76			0
more impressively , he managed to stay in seat @entity77 all the way to @entity35			0
@entity28 's free - kick was another slap in the face for the beleaguered @entity4 emerging blinking under the spotlight of tv cameras , the @entity83 manager — for now , at least — looked more relaxed once he reached the safety of a corridor underneath the main stand , smiling and greeting those who offered words of welcome and encouragement			1
yes , we know @entity94 has perfected the art of grinning through the agony , be it famously cracking jokes while lying on a stretcher with a broken leg on @entity102 duty or deploying gallows humour to deflect from some of the worst excesses of successive @entity6 regimes of dwindling competence and credibility			0
but he did n’t appear like a man overly concerned by his future			0
as for the latest incumbents to claim leadership roles at board level , well , both @entity114 brothers were at the game			0
it ’s not clear whether the in - house @entity121 @entity120 had them or the visiting boss in mind when he blasted out @entity125 — yep , @entity126 giving it laldy about knowing when to hold ’ em and when to fold ’ em — during the warm - up			1
the man with the music also gave @entity131 to mention an airing , so it was more than just a lucky bounce of the shuffle button			0
there was a danger , of course , that all the talk surrounding @entity4 ’s future would overshadow a fixture that , frankly , could hardly have been more important to a team desperate to make up ground in the title race			0
@entity29 celebrate taking the lead against @entity6 on friday night @entity58 fires home to put his side 2 - 0 up against @entity6 @entity6 could not afford to lose here , handing @entity52 the chance to move 12 points clear by winning at @entity151			1
queens had only just seen a seven - match unbeaten run ended at @entity155 and , with the visitors sounding occasionally sniffy about playing on artificial surfaces , few would have been absolutely stunned by a home win here			1
especially not in these circumstances			0
to muted chants of @entity163 from the away end , the home side started like a team with their eye on hunting down @entity6 and making them hurt , @entity58 coming within a stud length of connecting with a @entity169 cross and @entity170 just over-running a chance before shooting from a tight angle , @entity173 equal to his effort			1
all this in the opening 10 minutes			0
@entity175 looked in his pomp in the middle of the park for the home side , controlling the tempo of play and skipping past players at will			1
it was no surprise he should play a part , albeit indirectly , in the opener			0
@entity6 manager @entity4 ( right ) was the centre of attention at @entity29 with just under 20 minutes gone , the midfielder created chaos in the ranks of the red - clad visitors by driving past @entity192 to advance down the right flank , then floating in a curling cross that was heading for @entity170 — until @entity195 , in the process of slipping , stuck out a hand to divert the ball			1
shown a yellow that could have been a red , @entity195 ’s relief — and that of his team - mates — did not last long			1
@entity28 strode forward to convert the free - kick from the edge of the box in some style , smashing a left - footed effort into the top corner without troubling either the wall or goalkeeper @entity173			1
queens were looking dangerous , stretching @entity6 with their pace and passing			0
if the visitors were a little more blunt in attack , they did create a couple of chances , @entity216 forcing @entity217 to clear a header off the line , before @entity220 nodded over from point - blank range			1
the introduction of @entity227 for @entity228 at half - time was intended to give @entity6 more pace and trickery on the wing , although their first chance of the second half came via a more direct route , @entity216 holding up a long ball and playing in @entity223 , whose curling left - footed shot was batted away by keeper @entity225			1
@entity237 ’s sclaffed follow - up summed up his night			2
@entity4 took charge of @entity6 for their match at @entity29 on friday night @entity29 really should have gone two up with 56 minutes gone , @entity241 heading the ball straight to @entity58 , whose clever ball inside was hit first - time by @entity169 — when he really had time to shoot			1
@entity4 threw on @entity244 and @entity245 in place of @entity237 and @entity216 moments later , gambling on a change of strikers to provide something , anything , to gee his team up			0
@entity245 created panic by his mere presence , though he snatched a chance soon after coming on			0
aside from the odd roar in response to an on - field clash , of which there were a few , the away support were extremely subdued as their team plodded and rumbled their way into defensive traps or tactical dead ends			2
did anyone , but particularly @entity4 , have the answer to avoiding yet another damaging defeat ? clearly not			0
@entity29 , on the other hand , had the vision and the clinical touch to put this game beyond the toiling away side			1
as they showed with a killer second goal after 67 minutes			0
@entity175 ’s beautifully executed pass from the right wing found defenders @entity241 and @entity220 too far apart , leaving space for @entity58 to take the ball down in one touch and beat @entity173 with a sweetly - struck shot in off the post			1
and surely , now , the end for @entity4			0
@entity6 chief executive @entity284 ( top row centre ) talks to @entity4 before the match			0

@entity28 fired @entity29 ahead with a first - half free kick
forward @entity58 *slotted* home the second in the 67th minute
rangers remain nine points behind @entity39 leaders @entity52
