craters from asteroid impacts may be one of the best places to look for life on @entity5 , a study suggests			1
scientists have found microbes thriving more than a mile under a @entity9 crater where a space rock smashed into the @entity11 35 million years ago			1
they believe craters may provide a refuge protecting bugs from events such as ice ages or global warming			0
search for life : craters on @entity5 could hold the key to finding lifeforms on the red planet drilling beneath crater sites on @entity5 could potentially uncover similar life forms , say the scientists			1
researchers from the @entity29 drilled almost two kilometres ( 1.24 miles ) below one of the biggest asteroid impact craters on @entity11 at @entity32 in @entity33			2
samples revealed microbes spread unevenly through the rock			0
heat from an asteroid collision would kill everything living at the surface			0
but deep fractures in the rock would allow water and nutrients to flow in and support life , the researchers believe			2
professor @entity47 , from the @entity29 's @entity48 , said : ' the deeply fractured areas around impact craters can provide a safe haven in which microbes can flourish for long periods of time			0
' our findings suggest that the subsurface of craters on @entity5 might be a promising place to search for evidence of life			1
' the findings are published in the journal @entity64 .			0

drilling under @entity5 crater sites similar to those on @entity11 could uncover life
