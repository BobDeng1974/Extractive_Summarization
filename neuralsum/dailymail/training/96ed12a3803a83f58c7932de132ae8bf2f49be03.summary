@entity0 has admitted that even he has been surprised by how quickly @entity1 has adapted to @entity3 football			1
the @entity5 forward took his tally to 10 goals with a double strike to finally break @entity10 's resistance and send the @entity11 on their way to a 3 - 0 victory at the @entity14			1
' i was ready to give him time if he needed it , but he has settled in much quicker than expected , ' the @entity16 boss said			2
' there are similarities with ( @entity25 ) @entity24 a little bit by going at you , by being where you do not expect him to be in the box , and by having that huge desire to be at the end of things			0
' following an indifferent spell , @entity16 have now won three matches in a row , and are unbeaten since losing at @entity37 before the international break			2
@entity0 believes the way his team continued to stay positive despite the frustrations of seeing @entity10 goalkeeper @entity42 pull off a string of saves and the defenders make last - gasp blocks has them moving in the right direction again			1
the summer signing 's battling qualities have seen him compared to former @entity50 man @entity24 ' in the recent games at home we were not patient and we have learned			0
we look a bit more balanced between offence and defence , ' said manager @entity0 , whose side are now fourth , above @entity58 on goal difference , but still nine points off leaders @entity37			2
' we were less in trouble when we lost the ball , we were serious and that is very important in the efficiency			0
' with the return of @entity70 international @entity66 , who made a late cameo after 10 months out with a serious knee injury , @entity0 will soon have plenty of more attacking options			1
@entity73 forward @entity74 is also set to be in contention following the next international break after recovering earlier than expected from a broken foot			2
the @entity5 forward tucks away his second goal of the afternoon to cap a great performance against @entity10 ' for @entity66 it must be great as well to see that everybody wants him to come on , ' said @entity0 , who could give @entity66 another run out on tuesday night in the @entity84 against @entity85 when midfielder @entity86 is expected to be available again after a minor knee problem			1
' @entity88 also played very well after he came on , he could have scored two			0
' when you think that we have not got a number of offensive players like @entity94 , @entity86 and @entity74 , there is a lot of competition in the forward positions			0
' while @entity0 may feel his squad is now moving in the right direction , there remain more questions than answers for @entity10 boss @entity103			1
@entity1 has now scored 10 goals since moving to @entity16 from @entity105 in the summer however , with home matches coming up against the likes of @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 , spirits within the @entity10 camp remain high that illusive first top - flight win will come sooner rather than later to lift them off the foot of the table			1
' there has to be a future on what you do			0
you ca n't rely on a lucky win , or another one because you are never going to improve and build a team , ' said @entity103			0
' you have to build it by method and ours is reasonably sound , but we are coming up against teams who are of a higher level , and there is no negative in that			0

@entity1 scored twice as @entity16 beat @entity10 3 - 0
the @entity5 forward has now scored 10 goals for @entity16
@entity0 has been impressed with how well he has settled in
@entity66 made his long - awaited return against @entity10
the win takes the @entity11 up to fourth in the @entity141
