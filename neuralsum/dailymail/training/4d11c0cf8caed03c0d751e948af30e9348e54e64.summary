@entity3 addressed the faculty on tuesday in response to a question from government professor @entity12 ' 53 regarding the college 's apparent grade inflation , reported the @entity15			1
at @entity2 the most commonly awarded grade is an a government professor @entity12 ( left ) confronted the @entity18 @entity3 ( right ) on tuesday about the rise in a 's and the lowering of educational standards during the meeting 's question and answer period , @entity21 piped up and said , ' a little bird has told me that the most frequently given grade at @entity28 right now is an a- ' he called @entity2 's grading practice ' indefensible			1
' ' if this is true or nearly true , it represents a failure on the part of this faculty and its leadership to maintain our academic standard , ' he continued			1
@entity2 is an @entity39 school known for academic excellence @entity12 told the @entity15 that he was ' depressed ' upon hearing that an a was the most commonly awarded grade but said he was not ' surprised			1
' ' i thought the most prevalent grade was an a-minus , which is bad enough , ' @entity12 said tuesday to @entity46			1
when i asked the question [ about the most frequently given grade ] , it was worse , ' he said			2
' nor was i surprised at the embarrassed silence in the whole room and especially at the polished table ( as i call it ) , ' @entity12 said in regards to the table at the front of the room where high - ranking administrators sit			2
@entity60 class of 2011 gave their opinion to @entity63			0
' in regards to the grade inflation scandal at the moment i would say i personally never felt my grades were inflated			1
i think that ’s something everyone might say			0
i 'd say if there were any credence to the story it would have to do with departmental differences			0
in larger departments , students are more able to choose course work they ’d be better at succeeding in			0
@entity79 , for instance , is one of the largest departments at @entity2			0
i studied visual and environmental studies which are much smaller departments			0
’ @entity2 's grading policy was also criticized in 2001 but little has been done to curb inflation mr @entity12 believes that the grade inflation takes away merit from the @entity2 's most talented students			1
he told @entity46 that he actually awards students two separate grades : the one that will go on their transcript and the one that they ' deserve			1
' ' i did n’t want my students to be punished by being the only ones to suffer for getting an accurate grade , ' he said , adding that administrators must be the ones to change the grading methods			2
@entity46 spoke to students who did n't necessarily recognize the grade inflation			1
' i just find that hard to believe because it ’s pretty hard to get an a in any class , ' said @entity107 , 20 , a junior neurobiology major			0
a @entity2 economics major @entity109 , 20 said , ' i think it [ grade inflation ] definitely exists			1
' ' i think students and faculty , the data they have all point to the fact that it ’s an issue here more than elsewhere , ' she continued			2
this is actually not the first time @entity2 went under fire for a lackadaisical grading policy			0
in 2001 , @entity122 did a story for @entity124 on how grades , ' do n't mean what they once meant ' at @entity2			0
@entity12 was quoted as saying back then , ' to a give a student a c is like plunging a sword into his vitals			1
' @entity12 said he 's been fighting the inflation battle for years -- years before 2001			1
one student named @entity133 told @entity122 that he knew students who were awarded a b or b - for doing less than 5 per cent of the coursework			2
grading measures have drastically changed over the years at @entity2			0
in 1969 , 25 per cent of students got @entity128 's and lower			2
only 7 per cent got a 's back then			0
in 2001 only 9 per cent got a c or lower and over 26 per cent got @entity140 's			0
one cheeky @entity2 student told @entity122 that perhaps students are smarter now than the @entity2 students in the 1960s			2
@entity145 wants to tackle its grade inflation problem but fears that toughening standards will sway students towards attending other schools is this just a @entity2 problem ? apparently not			1
schools such as @entity153 and @entity145 have openly discussed their schools ' own grade inflation			1
@entity156 reported that last spring , @entity145 's ad hoc committee found that 62 per cent of @entity159 grades between 2010 and 2012 were in a range			2
there was a similar grade inflation problem at @entity153			1
when the school took measures to implement a new policy , it was n't an entirely positive outcome			0
critics call @entity145 's attempts to lower grades , ' grade deflation			1
' the @entity172 reports that when @entity153 implemented a stricter grading policy to curb a 's , less students applied / enrolled in the school for fear that an overly competitive school ( more so than equally regarded schools with more lenient grading policies ) would hurt them in the future job market @entity153 students reported that they were unhappy due to lower grades and fear that they will have trouble competing against @entity39 peers ( at equally regarded schools ) in the job market in 2009 , students in the a range at @entity153 fell below 40 per cent			1
in 2010 , 32 per cent of students said the grading policy was their top source of unhappiness followed by lack of sleep at 25 per cent			0
the dean of the undergraduate college at @entity153 in 2010 , @entity195 , said that the goal was to have no more than 35 per cent of grades in classes be in the a range			2
the @entity201 reports that ever since @entity153 implemented the strict grading policies , @entity153 's admissions yield dropped from 73.1 per cent for the class of 2007 to 68.7 to the class of 2013			1
when the @entity63 tried to contact several @entity39 schools about their mean and median grade point averegages , all of the schools said that they could not ' disclose that information			2
' @entity211 had some scattered data about grade inflation at @entity39 schools			1
@entity215 was measured based on a scale of 4.0 being the highest -- or an @entity140			0
the average @entity217 at @entity218 in 1931 was 2.33			0
there was a dramatic increase over the years			0
in 2007 it went up to 3.42			0
at @entity222 the average @entity217 was 3.20 in 1982 and went up to 2.42 in 2006			0
@entity223 saw an increase in @entity217 in more recent years			0
in 1990 the average @entity217 was 3.13 and in 2006 it went up to 3.36			0
perhaps grade inflation is not a @entity2 problem , but a problem of the current generation of college students at @entity230 and beyond .			1

government professor @entity12 ' 53 was so upset about grade inflation , he started giving students two grades -- one for their transcript and one for what they ' deserve '
' if this is true or nearly true , it represents a failure on the part of this faculty and its leadership to maintain our academic standard , ' said @entity12
when @entity153 attempted to stop grade inflation by giving out less a 's , the schools yield rate *declined* and so did student 's happiness rating
