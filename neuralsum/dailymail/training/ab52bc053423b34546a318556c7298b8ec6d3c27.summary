@entity0 , the mother of 16 week old @entity2 @entity1 who was shaken to death by her father , has been found dead at her @entity6 home a mother whose boyfriend was jailed for shaking their baby to death after he lost his temper when his cannabis ran out has been found dead			1
@entity2 @entity1 was just 16 weeks old when she suffered ' catastrophic ' head injuries and died after being shaken by her father @entity15 at her home in @entity6			1
the 25 - year - old shook the baby so hard she was bleeding from her eyes and he was jailed last year for manslaughter			1
almost a year later the child 's mother , @entity20 , 20 , was found dead at her home in @entity23 in @entity6			1
miss @entity20 was also accused of killing her daughter but was acquitted during the seven week trial last year			1
her body was found on november 29 and a post mortem into her death has so far been inconclusive			2
on the day of @entity2 's death , @entity15 and miss @entity20 had become ' agitated ' because they had run out of drugs			1
the pair argued and miss @entity20 left her daughter in the care of her father while she went out to the doctors			1
while she was out @entity1 is said to have shaken the youngster after losing his temper with the child when she was crying in january last year			2
the shaking caused a fatal brain bleed and @entity2 was taken to @entity40 where she was put on life support for three days until she died			2
during the trial a shocked expert said he had never before seen such a severe case of bleeding in the eyes			2
sentencing him to six years in prison for manslaughter , mr @entity47 told @entity1 : ' ' this is a case where a loss of control has resulted in a fatal act of violence on a defenceless baby			2
' you will have to live with the fact that you killed your daughter			0
' he added that @entity1 ' learning disabilities could have been a factor in the child 's death			2
during the trial , at @entity65 , the jury heard the young parents had a ' volatile ' relationship and there was evidence of arguments and fighting			0
social services stepped in and the couple had both signed agreements not to resort to domestic violence			0
@entity2 @entity1 was just 16 weeks old when she was shaken so violenty by her father she died but , even though @entity1 , who had learning difficulties and an iq in the low 50s , was subject to a restraining order banning him from contacting ms @entity20 , the court was told there was evidence he was still living with her on the day @entity2 was taken to @entity40			1
an examination on @entity2 's body found she had either been shaken or suffered a head injury from hitting her head against a soft surface - or a combination of both			1
during his trial @entity1 , who has an iq of 52 and can not read , initially told police he had not touched his daughter all day - claiming she had simply gone ' all floppy ' while he was feeding her			1
but he later admitted he ' slightly shook her ' at miss @entity20 's flat in @entity6			1
the court heard @entity1 had previous convictions and warnings for violence relating to miss @entity20 and his own mother , and previously punched a pregnant woman ' a number of times '			1
he had also used crack cocaine and heroin			0
he had been handed community orders , cautions , reprimands and warnings for the offences			0
@entity114 , defending , said @entity1 's ' modest ' upbringing in a ' drug - ridden ' neighbourhood meant it was ' hardly surprising ' he had acquired previous convictions and a drug habit			2
@entity15 was jailed for six years for manslaughter after he caused the death of his daughter mr @entity114 also explained that @entity1 had been attacked several times while in custody - including scalding water being thrown at his face - due to the nature of his offence			1
speaking after the case , @entity127 , crown advocate for the @entity128 , described the case as ' difficult ' and said people needed to understand @entity133 's sentence was given because he did not intend to kill the child			0
' he did nâ€™t intend to kill the baby , nor did he intend to cause it really serious harm			0
' also , the defendant does have serious learning difficulties			0
his iq is between 52 and 54			0
he lost control when he had that baby , probably because it cried			0
' as a result of that , he shook it and that baby died			0
' a spokesman for @entity148 said they were called to miss @entity20 's house on the afternoon of november 29 after her body had been found			1
he said : ' a post mortem into the death has been held but this was inconclusive			0
' the matter was referred to the coroner as a sudden death			0
we are continuing to make inquiries on behalf of the coroner .			0
