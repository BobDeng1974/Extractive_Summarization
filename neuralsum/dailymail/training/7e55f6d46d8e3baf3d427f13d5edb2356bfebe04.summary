during a series of events in @entity10 and @entity11 , @entity5 recruits will be fitted with @entity13 headsets ( picutred ) and dropped into virtual training exercises			1

the experiences were created by @entity10 - based @entity44 , and begin when the user takes a seat in a @entity47			1
the @entity13 headset is made by @entity49 , a virtual reality firm which initially received funding for the device through @entity52			2
the @entity53 is trialling a system that uses the @entity13 to drive armoured vehicles without soldiers having to stick their heads above the hatch			1
cameras mounted around the vehicle film its surroundings and this footage is fed to the driver through the headset , creating the illusion that the tank is ‘ transparent			0
’ when a driver looks left , they see footage from the left camera , and vice versa on the right - achieving a 360 - degree view of the road			0
by lowering their gaze and looking down towards the vehicle belts , the driver can also use the system to parallel park ' with a precision of up to a centimetre ' , without the assistance of the vehicle commander			0
it also removes the blind spots that occur when driving large vehicles			0
it raised more than $ 2 million dollars ( £ 1.3 million ) in 2012 , and last year @entity49 was bought by @entity87 for $ 2 billion ( £ 1.3 billion )			0
@entity87 co-founder @entity88 said at the time of the acquisition : ' @entity49 [ is ] the clear leader in something that has the potential to be the next important , or one of the next most important , computing platforms			0
' the headset is yet to go on consumer sale , although it is available online as a development kit for around £ 230 ( $ 350 )			0
the first @entity53 experience that uses the headset will drop the wearer into a live fire exercise with virtual members of the @entity103 at the @entity0 's @entity104			1
as a crewman in a challenger 2 tank , in the second experience , the wearer will be surrounded by other tanks engaging enemy positions using laser sights			1
they will also be able to communicate with other soldiers in armoured vehicles driving alongside			2
the @entity53 said it will add further experiences in the future			1
the @entity53 's new recruitment campaign , which involves a new tv advert that will be on show at the drive , comes as new research reveals one in four people said they felt challenge and excitement was missing from their job			1

@entity49 initially received funding for the device through @entity52			0
it raised more than $ 2 million dollars ( £ 1.3 million ) in 2012 , and last year @entity49 was bought by @entity87 for $ 2 billion ( £ 1.3 billion ) today 's events are taking place at @entity41 in @entity10 , the other at @entity11 's @entity42			1

the @entity53 said it will add further experiences in the future according to the @entity53 , a one @entity152 survey revealed that around seven in 10 people would consider volunteering or a part - time job alongside their normal work			1
and one in four said they would consider joining the @entity157 to ' find that challenge and excitement '			0
the @entity0 offers a ' 100 % @entity161 ' app ( pictured ) to help recruits build their fitness to the level of a soldier in training major general @entity167 , director - general of the army recruiting and training division , said : ' this research tells us that people feel their day jobs are lacking challenge , excitement and the opportunity to travel - all of which are available at a world - class standard with the @entity103			0
' by using the virtual headsets , people will be able to step straight into an exciting real - world scenario of volunteering with the @entity103 and the huge variety of challenging roles there are to choose from			0
' introducing virtual reality technology is just one of the ways that the @entity53 is transforming the way it recruits			2
the @entity53 recently introduced a simplified , online application form for mobile , tablet or desktop to help people sign up			2
it also offers a ' 100 % @entity161 ' app that helps new recruits build their fitness to the level of a soldier in training , and new mobile recruitment offices			0
