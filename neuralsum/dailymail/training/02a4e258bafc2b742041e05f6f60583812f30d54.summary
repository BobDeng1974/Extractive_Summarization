members of a @entity1 who knitted a miniature village for sick children were told it could not be given to them because the wool was a health and safety risk			1
the ladies of @entity8 in @entity9 spent a year creating the 6ft by 4ft soft intricate landscape - which boasts miniature people , houses , animals , a farm and a church			1
it was then offered to children ’s hospitals , hospices and nurseries to bring comfort to poorly youngsters , but was rejected over fears the wool could not be sterilised			1
the ladies were disappointed when several children 's hospitals and hospices turned away their miniature village for fears it was a health hazard around 30 members of @entity8 in rural @entity9 had teamed up to knit the intricate creation and used materials deemed safe for children 's toys			1
the group initially offered the village to @entity40 who told them they were unable to accept it because they could not sterilise it			0
they then approached various nurseries and hospitals in the local area who snubbed their gift because it did n’t come with the correct safety certification			2
the village took a year to create and measures 6ft by 4ft when laid out properly @entity55 , president of the @entity8 , said : ' it has everything you would expect to see in your typical village			1
' attention to detail : the kindhearted ladies even made sure the cows had udders when they were putting together this farm section of their soft village @entity68 , a 69 - year - old grandmother - of - eight who organised the mammoth project in her weekly craft sessions , says it took a whole year to knit			1
ms @entity68 said : ' we were all a bit fed up with knitting scarves so decided to do something a bit different			0
' everyone got involved in the knitting and we all really enjoyed doing it			0
we really felt it would bring a smile to some young children ’s faces			0
' but when we tried several nurseries and organisations we were told that the village could n’t be used because the wool could n’t be sterilised			1
the ladies were sure to stick to materials that were deemed appropriate for children 's toys when they were knitting it had n't occurred to them that hospitals or hospices may turn them away because the wool had n't been sterilised ' apparently , it did n’t have the correct health and safety certificate			1
it was such a shame as we had always planned to give it to a local children ’s hospice or hospital			0
' @entity104 , 72 , another of the creators , added : ' we did n’t think of this ‘ health and safety ’ when we started it			0
' we started with the intention of giving it away to four or five - year - olds to play with			0
' but because of health and safety issues it can not be sterilised or disinfected , so you would have a problem with a children ’s hospice or waiting rooms			2
' the ladies decided to display the village at a local horticultural show where it caught the eye of a charity volunteer			2
he told them of a @entity126 orphanage he said would be absolutely delighted to have it for the youngsters			2
the giant toy has now been boxed up in sections , and is ready to be dispatched in the coming weeks			0
@entity55 , president of the @entity8 , said : ' it has everything you would expect to see in your typical village			0
' it ’s very intricate - there are roses around the cottages and even the cows have udders			0
' it will be lovely if the village can indeed be sent over to the orphanage in @entity126 as the children there will get so much enjoyment out of it ' .			1

@entity151 members worked for a year to create the miniature village for sick children
the kindhearted ladies were turned away by nurseries , hospitals and hospices as wool used was n't sterilised
the village will now be to sent to an orphanage in @entity126
