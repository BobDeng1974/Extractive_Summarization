highlander @entity29 ’s body was found by @entity31 troops after a 17 - hour manhunt involving hundreds of servicemen , including @entity35 special forces			1
the soldier , from the 4th @entity38 , had been ‘ concerned ’ about the missing night vision goggles , the coroner was told			1
highlander @entity29 went to retrieve the goggles , which had been left by another soldier at a nearby vehicle checkpoint			1
his unit had been warned about the importance of looking after their kit and why it was vital it did not fall into enemy hands			2
the soldier , from @entity52 and on his first tour of duty , later mentioned going to bring back the goggles but a comrade told him there was ‘ no point ’ because they were due to go on patrol a few hours later			1
but shortly after completing his sentry duty at 2am on july 4 , @entity29 was caught on cctv walking out of the base wearing full body armour and carrying his sa - 80 assault rifle			2

he said : ‘ quite clearly @entity2 was concerned as regards the missing goggles and talked of going back to the checkpoint where they were last seen			1
‘ but the evidence , and in particular the @entity60 imagery , points quite clearly to @entity2 heading off in an entirely different direction			1
