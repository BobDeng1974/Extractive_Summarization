a shocking report from investigators at the @entity2 has found that 6.5 million dead people are still listed on the benefit agency 's rolls , listed at age 112 or older			1
illegal immigrants and thieves are taking advantage , according to the @entity2 's @entity10			1
the @entity11 set out to find out if death dates were being entered into computers for people who had ' exceeded maximum reasonable life expectancies			2
' if found millions who the government officially considered at least as old as the oldest living human currently alive			2
@entity20 social security numbers belonging to 6.5 million dead people were still listed as active – not deceased – when the @entity2 's inspector general investigated @entity22 : some of the still - active ssns belonged to people who were born before teh @entity20 @entity25 former homeland security secretary @entity26 launched the ' e-verify ' system in 2011 , which screens out illegal immigrants during hiring , but some have been using still - valid ssns belonging to dead @entity33 bureaucrats never added their @entity35 to the government 's ' @entity36 , ' so it 's possible benefits have been paid erroneously for decades			1
the @entity40 reported in october 2013 that there weer only 35 people on earth who were confirmed to be age 112 or older			0
the inspector general did not say how many benefit checks were sent to the 6.5 million @entity33 whose @entity2 accounts should have been closed out years ago			1
but the @entity11 's report , just one page in length confirms only that payments have been ' terminated ' for 410,074 of the affected accounts			0
@entity54 president @entity53 told @entity55 in a telephone interview that he was outraged by the possibility ' that there are dead people getting government checks			1
' ' now we 've got 6.5 million walking dead , ' he said , ' and frankly – are these @entity33 voting ? are they working ? are illegal immigrants using their ssns to get jobs ? ' indeed , ' thousands of the @entity68 could have been used to commit identity fraud , ' the inspector general 's report concludes			1
' we obtained information indicating a man opened bank accounts using several different @entity2 numbers , ' according to the @entity11 , which said two of them belonged to people born in 1869 and 1893			1
' and between 2008 and 2011 , employers trying to screen out illegal immigrants during hiring submitted 4,024 ' e-verify ' requests to the federal government representing 3,873 people who used ssns that belonged to people born before june 16 , 1901			1
@entity85 @entity84 sen. @entity84 told @entity86 that it 's ' incredible that the @entity2 in 2015 does not have the technical sophistication to ensure that people they know to be deceased are actually noted as dead			2
' @entity84 chairs the @entity90			0
the committee 's ranking @entity91 , @entity94 sen. @entity93 , noted that ' a few thousand ' of the deceased people who still had active @entity2 numbers were born before the @entity25			1

' when you 're an agency and you do n't do what you need to do to make sure people are n't getting money they 're not entitled to , that 's fraud , ' he said			0
' if you were a bank and you did n't have the checks in place to make sure your money was n't misused , you 'd be shut down , ' he said			0
' just ask @entity126 what could happen			0
... when government agencies do it , they 're just told to clean up their act			0
' ' @entity2 is on the verge of bankruptcy , ' @entity53 warned			2
