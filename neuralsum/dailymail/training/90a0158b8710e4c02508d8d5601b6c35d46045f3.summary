the president of the @entity12 said that other than in exceptional circumstances judges should treat requests to hear cases in closed courts with ‘ distaste and concern ’			1
in a blow to ministers , @entity2 said hearing evidence behind closed doors was ‘ against the principle of justice ’			1
he added that cases where one party was excluded from knowing the evidence against them were particularly ‘ offensive ’ and should happen only when they were ‘ convincingly demonstrated to be genuinely necessary ’			2
he spoke out during a case involving the government and an @entity31 bank accused of indirectly helping finance @entity34 ’s nuclear weapons programme			2
after a four - year fight @entity35 has successfully overturn an order , made by the @entity38 under counter-terrorism legislation , which barred it from operating in the @entity7			0
the case represents a victory for the principle of open justice and the @entity46 ’s campaigning against the introduction of courts that would hear some civil compensation cases in secret			1
bosses of the bank had argued the 2009 order was unlawful as they had not been given a chance to fight their case before it was imposed and were not party to the evidence heard in secret			0
their challenge led to the @entity12 – for the first time – holding a closed hearing to consider a previous secret ruling made by @entity64 judges			1
@entity2 said that a closed hearing was ‘ even more offensive to the fundamental principle [ of justice ] than a private hearing ’ , where both parties are represented			1
‘ at least a private hearing can not be said , of itself , to give rise to inequality or even unfairness as between the parties , ’ he said			0
fake justice : @entity2 said secret justice cases heard behind closed doors at the @entity78 were in fact ' not justice at all ' ‘ but that can not be said of an arrangement where the court can look at evidence and hear arguments on behalf of one party without the other party knowing , or being able to test , the contents of that evidence and those arguments , or even being able to see all the reasons why the court has reached its conclusions			1
’ @entity94 , deputy president of the @entity12 , said secret justice ‘ at this level ’ was ‘ really not justice at all ’			1
after judges heard evidence behind closed doors as part of @entity35 ’s @entity64 challenge of the 2009 order , their secret judgment was then considered by the @entity106			2
it dismissed the bank ’s challenge in 2011			0
but yesterday the order barring anyone in the @entity7 financial sector working with @entity35 was overturned after the @entity12 ruled that the @entity38 order had been ‘ demonstrably unfair ’ in wrongly singling out @entity35			1
the civil rights group @entity114 praised the verdict			0
@entity116 , the group ’s legal officer said : ‘ proud principles of open justice and the rule of law are the casualties as the secret justice disease infects the highest court in the land			2
‘ today ’s chilling judgment brutally exposes the government ’s claims and lays bare its willingness to overstate the importance of secrecy to serve its own ends			0
’ she added : ‘ given recent revelations of spying and snooping it really does seem that it ’s one rule for the state , another for everyone else – no scrutiny for them , no privacy for us			0
’ when the bank ’s case reached the @entity12 two lawyers joined justices at the private hearing			2
one was a barrister representing the @entity38			0
the other represented the interests of the bank but was not permitted to reveal what went on to the bank ’s bosses or any of its staff			0
the @entity38 is now likely to be liable for damages that could run to many millions of pounds .			0

closed courts ' against principle of justice ' say @entity12 president
@entity2 said requests of such should be treated with ' distaste '
