at the biggest @entity2 clubs , specifically at @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 , with @entity7 on their tails , it is expected that the average first - team wage in five years ' time will be £ 10million per player per season , or £ 200,000 per week			1
and while the average ' top club ' player will routinely be earning the kind of sums reserved at the moment for the best of the best in @entity20 football , it is entirely plausible that the best of the best will be on £ 500,000 per week or more			1
the best young players in the division - the likes of @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 - appear among the most likely candidates to command half - a - million pounds per week in the coming seasons , a figure which equates to £ 26m per year			2
the @entity2 will continue to be shown on @entity31 and @entity32 until 2019 in a £ 5.136bn deal @entity3 striker @entity34 is already earning £ 285,000 - a - week at @entity35 @entity7 's @entity25 , pictured in action against @entity37 , is in line to earn huge wages in the future @entity4 forward @entity26 is on the brink of agreeing a new £ 200,000 - a - week deal at @entity43 by 2020 , the average player in the @entity2 will be earning around £ 5m per year , or £ 100,000 per week - and that stunning figure will be applicable even down to many of the ' smaller ' teams , which might by then include the likes of @entity49 or @entity50			1
and this is not idle fantasy , but a prediction using hard data based on what has happened over the 23 - year history of the @entity2 - and what is likely to happen next in the wake of the latest staggering tv deals			2
@entity60 announced on tuesday that they have sold the @entity61 live rights to matches for the three season from 2016 - 17 to @entity31 and @entity32 for a combined £ 5.136 billion			2
when the foreign rights , near - live rights , clip rights and other commercial deals are done for the same period , it is expected the @entity2 will have income of almost £ 9 billion for that three - year period , or close to £ 3bn per year			1
a large majority of that money will go to the clubs , and the biggest single expenditure of any club is , and will continue to be player wages			1
as the accompanying table shows , the rise and rise of @entity2 wages has closely tracked the rise and rise in tv income			0
in the 1992 - 93 season the @entity2 as a whole earned £ 50.7m per year from tv deals , and the average first - team wage was around £ 120,000 per year , or £ 2,300 per week			1
the first @entity2 @entity61 tv deal with @entity31 last five years , and the second one lasted four years			0
by the third deal , tv income for the division was £ 520m a year - a tenfold increase on the first season			0
and the average first - team wage was approaching £ 1m a year			0
the numbers show us that player salaries among the elite have been rouhgly doubling every seven years up to now			0
the @entity2 's current income is almost £ 2bn per year and the average first - team wage is £ 2.3m a year , and more than double that at the top clubs			1
with the new money announced yesterday arriving in club coffers from the 2016 - 17 season , acceleration of wages is expected after that , although there will also be year on year increases until then			2
@entity6 's @entity109 and his fellow professionals earned an average of £ 680,000 - a - year back in 2001 @entity2 players earned an average of £ 1.6m a year in 2009 , more than £ 1m less than they do now @entity31 have invested a huge amount of money into tv rights since the @entity2 's inception in three years ' time , the rights for 2019 - 22 will be sold			1
the @entity2 are famously reticent to make predictions over whether they will gain even more next time , but the trend remains upwards , not least with so many overseas markets still coming to maturity			0
transfer spending has also grown significantly as tv income has grown			0
but it is wage packets that use the most cash each year - and they will continue to do so .			0

the @entity2 have announced a new £ *5.136billion* tv rights deal
top clubs expected to pay players an average of £ 200,000 - a - week
biggest stars could command wages of £ 500,00 - a - week or more
average top - *flight* players expected to earn around £ 100,000 - a - week
player wages have increased hugely as tv rights money has risen
