by @entity0 @entity2 coach @entity1 felt his side operated well in a changed system as they defeated @entity5 2 - 0 in their concluding @entity7 fixture on monday			1
the @entity8 emerged victorious from a slow - burning and often fractious contest in @entity10 , maintaining their 100 per cent record in the pool , after substitutes @entity14 and @entity16 both notched late goals			1
it was a different performance to that @entity20 's side had produced when they beat @entity21 5 - 1 in their group b opener or when they then saw off @entity23 3 - 2			1
' we limited @entity5 to a handful of opportunities , we neutralised them extremely effectively - and particularly in the second half we created more chances			1
' we did have to change our style today - and i will always pick a system and a strategy that will help us win			2
' however , we 're not perfect - in possession we still need to improve , but i do think we 're very good without the ball			0
' after each winning their first two group matches , both sides had already qualified for the last 16 ahead of this contest			0
but they went into it knowing that clinching first place in the pool would see them avoid a meeting in the next round with the winners of @entity73 - likely to be hosts and tournament favourites @entity76 , who were in action later on monday			1
the future 's bright : @entity80 was again the star man as @entity2 enjoyed a 2 - 0 victory over @entity5 @entity8 of class : @entity2 celebrate after topping @entity7 with a 100 - per - cent record goal difference meant @entity2 needed only a draw to ensure they remained at the summit			1
and despite @entity20 's comments about picking a team to win - and the fact that that was the final outcome - @entity5 coach @entity91 suggested that the @entity8 had ' only wanted to defend '			1
@entity91 said : ' we kept going and fighting for 90 minutes , but ultimately we did n't get the result			0
' we wanted to win this game and we gave our all			0
' we felt that @entity2 only wanted to defend			2
we expected @entity2 to go on the counter-attack with regularity and for such a long time we limited them to long shots			0
disappointment : @entity91 was upset not to get a result , and felt @entity2 had only set out to stifle his team second best : a runners - up finish means @entity5 will now face @entity76 in the last 16 fan - tastic : @entity2 supporters on the @entity107 beach celebrate their victory ' i felt that our intensity and commitment was outstanding			1
our players should have their heads held high as we 've played well in the three games so far and we 're now through to the round of 16			0
' @entity2 winger @entity80 - who , following @entity14 's 77th - minute header , provided the tee - up on the break in stoppage time from which @entity16 converted inside the six - yard box - said : ' if you told me that we 'd win our three games to finish top of the group two months ago i 'd have been delighted , but i do n't want to end it here			2
' we want to go on			0
although we want to enjoy the moment , we 'll soon need to start to work hard in training to improve even more			0
' you have to give compliment to both teams , both gave 100 per cent today			0
' we defended really well - and although @entity5 finished second i think they go far in this tournament			2

@entity2 beat @entity5 2 - 0 to maintain 100 *%* record
@entity8 will now face @entity139 in last 16 , avoiding @entity76
@entity20 *praises* ' extremely effective ' defence as his side adapt style
@entity5 manager @entity91 says @entity2 only set out to defend
