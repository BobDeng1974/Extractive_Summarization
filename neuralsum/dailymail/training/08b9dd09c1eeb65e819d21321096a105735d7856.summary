by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 08:09 est , 8 may 2012 updated : 19:22 est , 8 may 2012 thousands of passengers flew to @entity4 from @entity6 airports last week unaware they were being guarded by @entity4 air marshals amid fears that @entity9 was planning to explode a bomb on a transatlantic flight			1
security officials in the @entity4 said hundreds of armed sky marshals flew to @entity14 to accompany flights after intelligence that the terror network could be looking to mark the first anniversary of the killing of @entity20 by special forces in @entity22			1
dozens of @entity4 - bound flights from @entity25 and @entity26 by both @entity6 and @entity4 airlines are understood to have had at least one marshal on board			1
horror in the sky : sky marshals train to foil a terrorist attack			1
hundreds have been stationed on flights between the @entity4 and @entity6 in recent weeks following an intelligence alert warning of an @entity9 attack @entity37 : the fact @entity26 was so heavily monitored suggests there was specific information that one of its departures would be targeted plotter ? senior @entity9 leader @entity44 , killed on sunday by a drone strike , was believed to be behind the updated underpants bomb plot at one stage , every flight heading for the @entity4 is said to have been ‘ shadowed ’ by the marshals , whose weapons include low - velocity bullets that carry enough force to bring down a potential terrorist but not enough to blow through the skin of the aeroplane			1
amazingly , it appeared that @entity58 was kept in the dark about the scale of the security operation			0
the alert came after two intelligence breakthroughs by @entity4 investigators which provided evidence that @entity9 was still seeking to carry out attacks on @entity4 - bound commercial aircraft			1
new terror alert : @entity9 reportedly planned to strike on the first anniversary of @entity20 's death the first was the discovery that terrorists were attempting to target airlines travelling from @entity6 and other @entity14 airports with explosives surgically implanted inside their bodies			1
the second was the seizure by an undercover @entity81 agent of a device built without metal or tell - tale materials to avoid airport scanners that could be carried by a terrorist in his underwear			1
officials would not say whether a suspect had been caught during the operation			0
@entity4 security officials are said to have focused particular attention on flights using @entity6 airports because so many @entity4 - bound flights go through the @entity6 , and @entity6 has a ‘ history ’ of links to potential such attacks			1
two years ago bombs shipped to the @entity4 on cargo planes inside printer cartridges travelled through the @entity6			2
in addition , @entity6 has been identified as a source of potential suicide bombers by the @entity4 because ‘ a significant number ’ of its citizens are known to have travelled to @entity22 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 for terror training or to be sympathetic to jihadist causes			2
officials pointed out that young @entity6 , several trained in @entity22 , were part of a plot to bring down airliners over the @entity116 in a suspected @entity9 bomb plot five years ago			1
and @entity6 shoe - bomber @entity118 tried to blow up a @entity4 - bound plane in 2002 – one of at least five airline bomb plots linked to the @entity6			1
notified : the @entity122 said president @entity123 was told about the terror plot back in april , despite his administration 's claim over the last few weeks that there was no ' credible threat ' the scale of the deployment of air marshals had now been stepped down , officials indicated , but some ‘ are still travelling ’ while others ‘ remain on standby ’ in @entity14 and @entity134 cities			1
both @entity136 and @entity137 declined to discuss security issues last night , as did the major @entity4 airlines			2
when air marshals are on board , pilots are aware of their presence but passengers are not told because of the fear of causing panic			2
on an average week , around 630 transatlantic flights depart from @entity25			2
some 17million passengers flew from @entity6 airports to the @entity4 last year			2
the disclosure of the plot comes amid efforts by @entity123 ’s administration to make its counter-terrorism accomplishments a central issue in the presidential campaign			2
armed sky marshals were introduced on @entity6 airliners in 2003 in response to fears of a 9/11 - style terror attack launched from airports in the @entity6			1
then home secretary @entity163 said the move , which was confined to transatlantic routes , was a ‘ proportionate and appropriate response ’ to the terror threat against this country			0
at the time , reports indicated that plain - clothes officers would carry guns firing low - velocity bullets , to prevent one going through the target and piercing the shell of the plane			1
in all likelihood they would be seated near the cockpit , in first or business class			0
passengers are never notified if an air marshal is on their plane , although pilots are told			2
neither the airline industry , police nor @entity186 officials will comment publicly on the policy , and since its introduction it has largely been shrouded in secrecy			0
other countries are more open about their use of sky marshals			0
the @entity195 national airline , @entity196 , has had an armed marshal on every flight for more than a decade			0
and air marshals have been used in the @entity4 for more than 30 years			1
the bomb seized last month is said to be a ‘ sophisticated , modified version ’ of the device carried by @entity204 @entity203 , the former @entity6 - based student who tried to detonate his underwear device on board a packed @entity208 - bound airliner on christmas day 2009			1
@entity4 bomb experts are said to be picking apart the latest device , which had a more advanced detonator than the one that fizzled out in the previous attack , leaving @entity203 with severe burns			1
the @entity204 , who is serving a life sentence in the @entity4 , is to be questioned again following the latest discovery			2
officials said it was also likely that @entity6 @entity9 supergrass @entity221 , who trained @entity6 shoe - bomber @entity118 , will be questioned			1
@entity221 was convicted in 2001 of trying to blow up a @entity224 - bound flight but released early after agreeing to become a supergrass			0
both that bomb and the new device are suspected of being ‘ commissioned ’ in @entity105 by an affiliate of @entity9 and built by @entity231 bomb - maker @entity229			1
@entity4 officials said the @entity81 and other agencies tracked the latest plot for about a month before moving to seize the device in recent days in the @entity134 , outside @entity105			1
officials said that the bomb or its components were in transit when intercepted , but that the device was not seized at an airport and that @entity9 had yet to target a specific flight			1
officials stressed yesterday that it was a @entity4 - led operation and there was no known threat to @entity6 airports , planes or passengers			1
@entity58 commissioner @entity250 said the @entity251 was not involved in the inquiry			0
he said : ‘ the @entity4 have said they are examining material recovered			2
we will be interested to hear what the outcome is			0
‘ i wo n’t say an awful lot more			0
we are in a position of trying to get information from @entity4 to see what they have discovered			2
’ additional reporting : @entity264 to anti-terror investigators , there was little that marked out @entity203 as a potential @entity9 recruit and suicide bomber			0
as the son of one of @entity204 ’s most prominent businessmen , the 25 - year - old former @entity6 university student lived a privileged life with access to large funds , homes in three countries and international travel			0
during his time studying mechanical engineering at @entity281 , he was described as a ‘ quiet , caring , diligent student ’			0
investigators admit he ‘ simply did not fit their profile ’ of a potential terrorist			0
yet on christmas day 2009 , @entity203 came close to blowing up a packed transatlantic flight with explosives sewn into his underwear			0
he flew from @entity291 to @entity292 , then boarded @entity293 to @entity208 , which was carrying 279 passengers and 11 crew			0
hours into the flight , he tried to detonate the explosives by injecting chemicals into them			0
he suffered severe burns when the bomb failed to explode , and was overpowered by passengers and crew			0
disturbingly , the bomb was not picked up in airport security checks in @entity291 and @entity292			0
now serving a life prison sentence in the @entity4 , @entity203 is certain to be questioned again about his bomb , its maker and those who supplied it			1
in @entity310 , he was president of the university ’s @entity311 and ‘ crossed the radar screen ’ of @entity314 , the @entity6 ’s domestic counter-intelligence and security agency , for radical links and communications with @entity311 extremists			0
but investigators say that @entity9 operatives identified @entity203 only as ‘ vulnerable ’ and did not target him until after he began studying @entity322 in the @entity105 capital @entity323 in august 2009			0
old bomb : pictured here is the slightly charred and singed underwear which housed the explosives used by @entity203 since the terror attacks on the morning of september 11 , 2001 , @entity9 has put different types of plans into action in numerous @entity334 plots			0
while none of the plots have been successful , they have brought change to airport screenings and other security measures .			0
