by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter four junior officers have been accused of being at the center of the @entity6 nuclear missile launch officers cheating scandal - investigators refer to them as ' the librarians			1
' at least 82 missile launch officers in total face disciplinary action in the still - unfolding controversy , but it was the four ' librarians ' who allegedly facilitated the cheating , investigators say , by transmitting test answers via text message and other methods			1
one text brazenly included a photo of a classified test answer , according to lt. gen. @entity23 , who announced the probe 's findings during a thursday news conference at the @entity27			0
tough task : @entity29 ( @entity29 ) commander lt. gen. @entity23 speaks thursday to reporters at the @entity27 during a briefing where he announced preliminary findings in the investigation ' they tended to be at the hub ' of illicit exchanges of test information , said @entity38 , one of seven investigators who dug into details of cheating that has embarrassed the @entity6 and on thursday brought down virtually the entire operational command of the @entity43 at @entity44 , @entity45 @entity23 said the quartet of enablers were at ' the crux of it , ' and that three of the four also are accused of illegal drug activity			1
the rest of the accused either participated in cheating or were aware of it but failed to blow the whistle			1
@entity38 said the investigation team examined evidence from cellphones allegedly used to transmit the offending text messages but was unable to interview either of the four suspects because they each obtained legal counsel as soon as they became aware of the investigation			0
those four have not yet been publicly named			0
the @entity6 fired nine mid-level commanders at @entity65 and announced it will pursue a range of disciplinary action against the accused 82 , possibly to include courts - martial , in response to the findings			1
a 10th commander , the senior officer at the base , resigned and will retire from the @entity6			1
more questions than answers : air force secretary @entity75 , accompanied by @entity23 , during a q&a session after a thursday press briefing @entity6 officials called the discipline unprecedented in the history of @entity82 's intercontinental ballistic missile force			2
an @entity2 expose last year revealed a series of security and other problems in the icbm force , including a failed safety and security inspection at @entity89 , where the exam cheating occurred			2
@entity38 said the investigation team interviewed missile launch officers and others at the @entity6 's two other icbm bases and found no indication of cheating there			1
' folks clearly crossed the line at @entity89 , ' @entity38 said in a telephone interview			0
he is a faculty member at the @entity100 at @entity101 , @entity102 the investigators found what @entity38 described as ' a persistent cultural problem ' inside the @entity107 force — a perception among the crews ' that you do n't want to be there , ' in part because of a sense that the mission is not highly valued			0
in an emotion - charged resignation letter titled ' a lesson to remember , ' col. @entity115 , who commanded the @entity43 at @entity89 , lamented that the reputation of the @entity107 mission was now ' tarnished because of the extraordinarily selfish actions of officers entrusted with the most powerful weapon system ever devised by man			1
' @entity115 , seen as a rising star in the @entity6 , had been nominated for promotion to brigadier general just days before the cheating scandal came to light in january			1
instead he is retiring , convinced , as he wrote in his farewell letter thursday , that ' we let the @entity82 people down on my watch			2
' gone : @entity82 @entity6 shows col. @entity135 , the top commander at the @entity45 base where the exam cheating was discovered in january , has resigned separately , another of the @entity6 's nuclear missile units — the @entity140 at @entity141 , @entity142 — announced that it had fired the officer overseeing its missile squadrons			1
it said col. @entity145 , the operations group commander , was sacked ' because of a loss of confidence in his ability to lead			2
' the @entity140 offered no further explanation for @entity145 's removal and said it ' has nothing to do ' with the firings announced by the @entity6 in @entity153			0
together , the extraordinary moves reflect turmoil in a force that remains central to @entity82 defense strategy , but , in some ways , has been neglected			0
the force of 450 @entity161 3 missiles is primed to unleash nuclear devastation on a moment 's notice , capable of obliterating people and places halfway around the globe			2
in a bid to correct root causes of the missile corps ' failings — including low morale and weak management — the @entity6 also announced thursday a series of new or expanded programs to improve leadership development , to modernize the three icbm bases and to reinforce ' core values , ' including integrity			2
air force secretary @entity75 , the service 's top civilian official , told a @entity27 news conference that a thorough review of how testing and training are conducted in the @entity107 force has produced numerous avenues for improvements			0
' we will be changing rather dramatically how we conduct testing and training going forward , ' while ensuring that performance standards are kept high , @entity188 said			0
more funds will be invested in refurbishing the underground @entity107 launch control centers and making other infrastructure improvements , she added			0
@entity23 , head of all @entity6 nuclear forces as commander of @entity29 , said the changes in training and testing will be far - reaching			2
' we 're not just putting a fresh coat of paint on these problems , ' he said			0
' we 're taking bold action			0
' disciplinary measures : @entity188 and @entity23 announced the firing nine mid-level commanders and disciplining of dozens of additional junior officers @entity188 had promised to hold officers at @entity65 accountable once the cheating investigation was completed and the scope of the scandal was clear			1
none of the nine fired commanders was directly involved in the cheating , but each was determined to have failed in his or her leadership responsibilities			1
@entity23 said investigators determined that the cheating , which officials originally said happened in august or september last year , began as early as november 2011 and continued until november 2013			0
a total of 100 missile launch crew members were identified as potentially involved in the cheating , but nine were cleared by investigators			1
another nine of the 100 are being handled separately by the @entity6 @entity220 ; eight of those nine involve possible criminal charges stemming from the alleged mishandling of classified information			0
the cheating involved unauthorized passing of answers to exams designed to test missile launch officers ' proficiency in handling ' emergency war orders , ' which are messages involving the targeting and launching of missiles			1
nine key commanders below @entity115 were fired , including the commanders of the 341st wing 's three missile squadrons , each of which is responsible for 50 @entity161 nuclear missiles			1
also sacked were the commander and deputy commander of the @entity43 , which oversees all three missile squadrons as well as a helicopter unit and a support squadron responsible for administering monthly proficiency tests to @entity65 's launch crews and evaluating their performance			1
no generals are being punished			0
maj. gen. @entity248 , who was relieved in october of his duty as commander of the 20th @entity6 , which is responsible for all three 150 - missile wings of the icbm force , is still on duty as a staff officer at @entity255 but has requested retirement ; his request is being reviewed			1
@entity248 was fired after a military investigation determined that he had engaged in inappropriate behavior while leading a @entity82 government delegation to a nuclear security exercise in @entity262 last summer			0
he was replaced by maj. gen. @entity263			0
the cheating at @entity65 was discovered in early january during the course of an unrelated drug investigation that included two launch officers at @entity89 and others at several other bases			2
the drug probe is continuing			0

four junior officers are said to have facilitated the cheating among dozens of missile operators
at least 82 people participated in or knew of the cheating and did nothing - they all face disciplinary action
