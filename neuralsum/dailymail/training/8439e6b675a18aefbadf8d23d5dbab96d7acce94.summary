@entity0 had a well - paid job and a buzzing social life			1
but five years ago his world came crashing down after he developed crippling cluster headaches			1
also known as ' suicide ' headaches , these are said to cause the most severe pain known to man ( female sufferers say it 's far worse than childbirth )			1
' one thursday the pain hit me at work , ' says @entity0 , now 46			1
' it felt as if there was a knife going through my eyeball			2
it was the worst pain i 'd ever experienced			1
he 's tried 15 types of medications , and clinical trials , to treat them , but none worked and some caused severe side - effects including blood poisoning , heart palpitations and vomiting			1
the attacks were so debilitating that @entity0 had to quit his job as senior manager at an accountancy firm in march 2010			1
no longer earning , he was forced to sell his home , and has rarely been able to go out			2
but a new handheld device has made his life ' liveable ' again			1
it targets the vagus nerve , which runs from the brain to the abdomen and relays messages to and from the heart , lungs and digestive system			2
the nerve helps regulate key functions such as breathing and heart rate - but scientists increasingly believe it plays a role in a range of conditions , from depression to asthma and heart failure			2
in september 2013 , @entity0 took part in a clinical trial at the @entity62 , @entity63 , testing the use of the device , called @entity66			1
it 's applied to the neck and sends small electric pulses into the nerve			2
they are also known as ' suicide ' headaches , and female sufferers say it 's far worse than childbirth these pulses are thought to reduce levels of certain neurotransmitters - chemical messengers in the @entity80 theory is that people who suffer from severe frequent headaches may produce too many neurotransmitters and , as a result , sensations that are not normally painful , such as seeing light , are misinterpreted by the brain , causing headache			1
users apply the battery - powered device to the neck for around two minutes when they feel a headache coming on			1
' it always makes the pain less severe , and can stop my attacks within 25 minutes , ' says @entity0 , who lives in @entity97 with his partner @entity98 , 31			1
' it 's improved my pain by around 40 per cent and i feel living with this condition is n't hopeless any more , so i have fewer dark days			1
' it 's not a cure - all			2
when 19 people with cluster headaches took part in a trial at @entity109 , @entity110 , half found the device started to reduce symptoms after 11 minutes			1
for this half it also helped them reduce their medication by half and reduced the frequency of their attacks from an average of 4½ to 2½ a day , says @entity122 , professor of neurology at @entity124			2
he is now using the @entity66 , which is applied to the neck and sends small electric pulses the only side - effect was a slightly uncomfortable tugging feeling in the neck when it was used			1
while acknowledging that more studies are needed to check its efficacy , professor @entity122 says : ' if a proportion of people with a dreadful problem get some benefit , that 's a good step forward			2
' as well as cluster headaches , vagus nerve stimulation is being used to treat patients with epilepsy			1
here , it 's usually given via a surgically - implanted electrode , but in recent years external devices have been used , too			1
it is thought to send messages to the brain which interfere with the chemicals that cause seizures			2
' it does n't always work brilliantly , but it 's often the best treatment we have for epilepsy , ' says @entity154 , a consultant neurosurgeon at @entity109			0
vagus nerve stimulation is being used in some cases of depression , too			0
this followed the discovery that epilepsy patients being treated with vagus nerve stimulation reported it improved their depression ( even when the treatment did not help their epilepsy )			0
it is thought the pulses alter brain chemistry , which helps to improve mood			0
researchers are now looking at its benefits for other health problems , including obesity and heart failure			0
scientists have found that stimulating the vagus nerve slows the heart , allowing it to fill more with blood and then pump powerfully			0
the mild current given off by these stimulators do n't affect organ function			0
there is also ongoing research into its anti-inflammatory effects			0
a @entity188 study published in december found that patients with rheumatoid arthritis given vagus nerve stimulation experienced a significant reduction in pain after just six weeks			1
a tiny disc was implanted in their chest , which was attached by a wire to the vagus nerve in the neck			0
the team said similar techniques could reverse other chronic conditions such as diabetes , as it may influence the levels of hormones produced by the body , including insulin			0
estimated number of work and school days lost due to migraines every year meanwhile , a team at @entity212 is working on a microchip designed to stimulate the vagus nerve and suppress appetite , helping obese people lose weight			0
the microchip , implanted through keyhole surgery , is placed around a nerve in the gut , which is in turn connected to the vagus nerve			0
the microchip senses high levels of hunger hormones such as ghrelin and sends electrical signals through the vagus nerve			0
these supposedly trick the brain into thinking that you are full			0
as professor @entity229 , director of the @entity230 at @entity212 , explains : ' the chip only provides therapy if it diagnoses that you are producing too much hunger hormone			0
' the technique may even be useful for @entity236 's			0
simulating the vagus nerve may encourage the brain 's locus coeruleus to release a form of adrenaline that boosts alertness and memory , says mr @entity154			0
but is a handheld device or an implant better ? professor @entity122 believes the external devices are the way forward			1
' they allow patients to test whether something works before having a device implanted , and if they can be produced cheaply and used at home , that saves the cost and time of using a surgeon			2
' however , mr @entity154 says one benefit of implanted devices is that patients do n't need to remember to use it , which can be very helpful for the elderly			0
' @entity262 nerve stimulation is rarely a miracle cure , but it 's a useful push in the right direction			0
' @entity66 , which costs £ 250 for the device , is available privately			1
treatment must be approved by a doctor .			0

@entity0 , 46 , from @entity97 developed ' suicide ' headaches
illness causing ' most severe pain known to man ' crippled him 5 years ago
but new handheld device @entity66 has made his life ' liveable ' again
