by @entity0 published : 07:18 est , 16 november 2012 updated : 08:59 est , 16 november 2012 court victory : @entity2 wrote on @entity3 that gay marriages were an ' equality too far ' a @entity7 housing worker who was demoted for criticising gay marriage on @entity3 today won his battle to get his job back			1
@entity2 , 55 , lost his managerial position , had his salary cut by 40 per cent and was given a final written warning by @entity15 's @entity14 after posting that gay weddings in churches were ' an equality too far '			1
mr @entity2 was today awarded less than £ 100 compensation at @entity21 ’s @entity20 after winning his legal action for breach of contract			1
mr @entity26 , ruling in his favour today , said he had ' real disquiet ' about the limited financial award for mr @entity2 , who was only paid the difference between his contractual salary and the amount he earned for the 12 weeks after he took on the reduced role			1
the comments were not visible to the general public and were posted outside work time , but the trust said he broke its code of conduct by expressing religious or political views which might upset co-workers			0
@entity41 , chief executive at the housing trust , said : ' we fully accept the court 's decision and i have made a full and sincere apology to @entity2			2
' at the time we believed we were taking the appropriate action following discussions with our employment solicitors and taking into account his previous disciplinary record			0
' we have always vigorously denied allegations that the @entity14 had breached an employee 's rights to freedom of religious expression under @entity61 legislation and , in a written judgment handed down on 21st march 2012 , a district judge agreed that these matters should be struck out			2
' this has been a case about the interpretation of our code of conduct and the use of social media by our managers			0
' this case has highlighted the challenges that businesses face with the increased use of social media and we have reviewed our documentation and procedures to avoid a similar situation arising in the future			0
@entity2 remains employed by the @entity14 and i am pleased this matter has now concluded			1
' in response to the amount of money awarded to mr @entity2 , he added : ' sadly , the first time we knew that court proceedings had been issued against us was when we read about it in the @entity88 and we had little option but to defend our position			1
' we had tried to come to a settlement with mr @entity2 which would have resulted in him receiving 10 times the amount he was claiming , but he chose to reject this offer			1
' supported : mr @entity26 ruled in his favour at @entity21 's @entity20 , pictured , and his company has had to apologise and pay him damages he said the @entity14 would be making no further comment			1
the dispute began in february 2011 , when mr @entity2 posted a link to an article from the @entity102 website on his @entity3 page			1
the headline was ' gay church marriages get go ahead ' and he added the comment , ' an equality too far '			2
two colleagues read the remark , which could be viewed by friends and friends of friends , and one of them posted a response asking mr @entity2 to explain what he meant			1
the next evening he posted : ' i do n't understand why people who have no faith and do n't believe in @entity119 would want to get hitched in church			0
difficult : @entity41 , chief executive of the @entity14 , said the case highlighted the challenges that businesses face with the increased use of social media ' the @entity127 is quite specific that marriage is for men and women			2
if the state wants to offer civil marriage to the same sex then that is up to the state ; but the state should n't impose its rules on places of faith and conscience			0
' the judge said that the trust did not have a right to demote mr @entity2 as his @entity3 postings did not amount to misconduct , and the demotion imposed by way of purported disciplinary sanction constituted a breach of contract			1
he admitted he felt ' uncomfortable ' that he had only awarded ' very modest ' damages to mr @entity151			2
' i must admit to real disquiet about the financial outcome of this case , ' he said			0
' mr @entity2 was taken to task for doing nothing wrong , suspended and subjected to a disciplinary procedure which wrongly found him guilty of gross misconduct , and then demoted to a non-managerial post with an eventual 40 per cent reduction in salary			1
' the breach of contract which the trust thereby committed was serious and repudiatory			0
' a conclusion that his damages are limited to less than £ 100 leaves the uncomfortable feeling that justice has not been done to him in the circumstances			1
' change of fortunes : the @entity14 made ' a full and sincere ' apology			2
pictured , the front page of the organisation 's website he added that if mr @entity2 had commenced proceedings for unfair dismissal in the @entity181 , rather than starting an action for breach of contract in the county court , there was every reason to suppose that the tribunal would have been able to award him substantial compensation if it felt he had been unfairly treated			1
if financial stringency made it practically impossible for mr @entity2 to bring such proceedings , then the injustice he had suffered , although very real , was something the court was unable to alleviate by a substantial award			1
later , mr @entity2 said in a statement : ' i ’m pleased to have won my case for breach of contract today			1
the judge exonerated me and made clear that my comments about marriage were in no way " misconduct "			0
' my award of damages has been limited to less than £ 100 - but that is for technical legal reasons and the judge made it clear he was not able to award me a much larger sum			1
' but i did n’t do this for the money - i did this because there is an important principle at stake			0
' @entity218 is a free country where people have freedom of speech , and i am pleased that the judge ’s ruling underlines that important principle			0
' but this sad case should never have got this far			0
long ago , @entity14 should have held their hands up and admitted they made a terrible mistake			2
had they done this then my life would not have been turned upside down and my family and i would not have had to endure a living nightmare			0
' however , to the bitter end , they claimed i had broken equality policies and brought the @entity14 into disrepute - all because , like millions of people , i support traditional marriage			2
' something has poisoned the atmosphere in @entity218 , where an honest man like me can be punished for making perfectly polite remarks about the importance of marriage			0
' i have won today			0
but what will tomorrow bring ? i am fearful that , if marriage is redefined , there will be more cases like mine - and if the law of marriage changes people like me may not win in court			0
' does the prime minister want to create a society where people like me , people who believe in traditional marriage , are treated as outcasts ? that may not be his intention , but , as my treatment shows , that ’s what will happen			0
' the prime minister should think very carefully about the impact of redefining marriage on ordinary people			0

@entity2 said on @entity3 that gay weddings were ' an equality too far '
he then lost his managerial position and had his salary cut by 40 per cent
his boss at the @entity14 apologised and he was *reinstated*
the high court judge said he felt justice had not been done to mr @entity2 because he only received ' very modest ' damages of less than £ 100
