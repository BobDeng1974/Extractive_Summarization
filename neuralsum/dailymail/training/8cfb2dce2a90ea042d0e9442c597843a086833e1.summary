by @entity0 for @entity1 love it or hate it , @entity2 is the iconic spread that has been an essential part of @entity6 's heritage dating back to the 1920s			1
but 10 @entity9 kids were not too fond of the dark brown food paste made from yeast extract and vegetables			2
and looks can be deceiving , as some initially reacted with excitement as they thought the bowl of @entity2 was chocolate pudding and questioned whether this was @entity6 's version of @entity17 , a sweet @entity19 hazelnut spread			1
others were more sceptical , describing it as ' poop '			2
@entity23 is one of 10 @entity9 kids who tried @entity2 for the first time in the @entity27 video ' @entity25 ' the much - loved iconic @entity6 spread has been around since the 1920s the children appeared in a @entity27 video done by the @entity33 channel @entity23 , one of the kids filmed for the @entity36 @entity27 video entitled ' @entity37 ' , held her nose and gasped in horror as a scoop of the paste was presented on a silver platter			1
she was convinced the dark consistency of @entity2 was akin to ' poop ' while most were hopeful and thought it was some sort of chocolate pudding - albeit clearly confused by its appearance			1
