by @entity0 published : 09:36 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 02:36 est , 25 july 2013 the birth of the @entity2 and @entity2 of @entity4 's baby has been one of the most keenly awaited of the decade and well - wishers no doubt wish to shower the tiny prince with gifts			0
but @entity10 and @entity11 have asked for donations to charity rather than wasteful gifts , and expectant parents across the @entity16 are endorsing the royal couple 's frugal approach			1
rather than engraved spoons , flowers and pretty trinkets , it is practical items that expectant parents want to receive on the birth of a new child , according to research			2
practical parents : @entity10 and @entity11 have asked for donations to charity rather than wasteful gifts , and expectant parents are doing the same , according to new research on the birth of a child , 72 per cent of couples say they prefer practical items that will help money go a little further			1
gifts such as clothing , multi-store gift cards and even nappies are being welcomed , while only one in 10 couples would welcome more frivolous gifts such as bouquets of flowers or keepsakes			1
and even those who do think practically admit there are still problems when receiving this sort of gift : eight per cent of new parents admit even practical gifts end up being wasted because of the number of duplicate presents they receive			2
clothing is the top item on the ' wasted ' list , due to clothing for newborns quickly becoming too small and parents receiving many of the same item			0
frugal : following the @entity62 ' lead , gifts such as clothing , multi-store gift cards and even nappies are being welcomed , whereas only 1 in 10 couples would welcome more frivolous gifts such as bouquets or keepsakes a spokesman for @entity67 who carried out the survey , said : ' @entity10 have read the public mood perfectly			1
although this baby will have a luxury lifestyle , they are clearly trying to avoid signs of unnecessary excess			0
' our research indicates this will go down well with parents in the @entity16 who are also taking a more practical approach and avoiding waste			0
' most people will spend between £ 20 and £ 40 on a present to mark a baby ’s birth , and given the large number of gifts that people receive when a child is born , that could easily be £ 400 or £ 500 in gifts			0
