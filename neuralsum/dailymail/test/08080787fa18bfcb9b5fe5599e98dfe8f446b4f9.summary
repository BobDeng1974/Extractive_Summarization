@entity0 has refused to rule out further cuts to child benefit if the @entity3 win a second term			1
the chancellor appeared to leave the door open when asked if he would be ‘ depriving more families ’ of the payments which are worth more than £ 1,000 per year			1
more than a million households lost out when the @entity10 announced that families with one parent earning £ 50,000 would pay tax on child benefit			1
earners over £ 60,000 lost out altogether			0
it meant anyone earning less than £ 50,000 – even a couple on £ 49,000 each - still received the full entitlement of £ 20.70 a week for the first child , and £ 13.70 for every subsequent child			2
mr @entity0 was asked at a briefing in central @entity33 on the economy this morning whether he could ‘ rule out depriving more people of child benefit , like you ’ve already done in this @entity38 ? ’ the @entity3 say they would cut £ 30billion of spending if they win a second term			1
of this £ 12billion would be slashed from the welfare bill , with the rest from government departments and further cracking down on tax avoidance			0
while the prime minister has given a commitment to protect the state pension , few other savings have been set out apart from reducing the cap on a family ’s annual benefits from £ 26,000 to £ 23,000			0
mr @entity0 did not directly answer about reducing the threshold , only saying that child benefit would not be replaced by the new benefits system @entity55 , which is being rolled out nationally			1
the respected think tank the @entity56 have suggested that increasing @entity55 for some families and using it instead of child benefit could save £ 4.8billion a year			1
the chancellor said : ‘ you can judge us on our record in this @entity38			0
if we wanted to put child benefit into @entity55 we would have done it when we set up @entity55			1
‘ we ’ve got a track record , we ’ve got a plan based on clear principles of making work pay , sharpening work incentives			0
’ asked again why he did not rule out any type of child benefit cuts , he said : ‘ i ’ve given you a very clear answer			1
we ’ve created a welfare system where child poverty is down , inequality is down , we have a record low number of workless households and what we are doing is creating welfare system where it pays to work and we protect the most vulnerable			0
‘ we are going to carry on doing that in the next @entity38			0
but we ca n’t do any of these things without economic security and a growing economy			0
’ mr @entity0 was asked at a briefing in central @entity33 on the economy this morning whether he could ‘ rule out depriving more people of child benefit , like you ’ve already done in this @entity38 ? ' the chancellor said the @entity10 had saved £ 21billion in this @entity38 , and the ‘ same principles ’ would apply if his party win a second term – with further reforms to welfare the chancellor said the @entity10 had saved £ 21billion in this @entity38 , and the ‘ same principles ’ would apply if his party win a second term – with further reforms to welfare			1
‘ this is perfectly achievable and anyone who thinks that the job of reforming welfare has somehow been completed , i think , is mistaken			0
‘ we want to go on creating a welfare system which rewards work and the aspirations of families and protect the most vulnerable ’ , he said			2
it is widely speculated that the @entity3 could restrict child benefit to just two children , to save around £ 2billion a year			1
work and @entity112 secretary @entity111 is sympathetic to the idea			0
he recently said it was ‘ well worth looking at ’ and could save ‘ significant money ’ and help with ‘ behaviour change ’ by forcing couples to think carefully about whether they could afford to have another child			0
it was not seriously considered in this @entity38 due to opposition from the @entity121 and @entity122 appeared to reject it last year amid concerns it would alienate low - income families			1
the event attended by mr @entity0 , and treasury minister @entity127 and @entity128 was an analysis of the @entity131 ’s party fiscal plans , if @entity132 gets into @entity133			2
he claimed the @entity131 would ‘ never ’ eliminate the budget deficit – unlike @entity3 plans to run a surplus by 2020 – because they would borrow billions of pounds every year and not cut spending			2
‘ when the economy 's growing , and we 're not in recession , we should be raising more than we spend ’ , he said			0
‘ that 's the way , proven around the world , to bear down on your national debt and best prepare yourself for any future economic storms			0
fixing the roof while the sun is shining			0
‘ the @entity131 do n't want to do that , they only talked about balancing the current , day to day , spending while continuing to borrow to pay for capital spending			2
what they do n't tell you is that means a permanent , never - ending budget deficit			0
’ @entity131 ’s shadow chief secretary to the treasury @entity154 said mr @entity0 had put middle income families in the firing line			1
he said : ‘ the @entity158 wo n't admit where their £ 12 billion of welfare cuts will come from , but after this press conference it 's now clear middle income families are in the firing line			1
‘ @entity0 repeatedly refused to rule out rolling child benefit into universal credit			1
this would mean 4.3 million families losing over £ 1,000 a year , according to the independent @entity56			2
’ an aide to mr @entity0 played down suggestions the @entity3 were planning changes to child benefit			2
