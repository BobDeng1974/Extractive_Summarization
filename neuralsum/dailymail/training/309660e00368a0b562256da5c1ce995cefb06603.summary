a second @entity1 candidate vying for a seat in the @entity3 is refusing to say whether she voted for @entity4 in the last two presidential elections			1
when confronted by a tracker for @entity9 , a @entity10 opposition research outfit , yesterday , @entity7 candidate @entity6 stayed mum about her voting history			1
her only response was in the form of a grin she gave her questioner as she walked away from him and toward the entrance of the venue she was about to enter , an early voting center at the @entity22 , in @entity23 , @entity24 , according to the @entity25			2
@entity6 was reportedly confronted by a tracker outside the venue and asked whether she voted for @entity4 for president			1
the @entity7 candidate would n't respond ' ms. @entity6 , did you vote for president @entity4 in 2008 and 2012 ? ' the tracker had asked her , pouncing on an opportunity to toss @entity6 the same question that 's tripped up fellow @entity1 @entity3 candidate @entity42 of @entity43			1
a @entity6 supporter can then be heard in the background telling the young man , ' would you leave her alone ? ' as @entity6 and her gaggle of supporters continued walking , other members of her entourage began touting president @entity4 's accomplishments			1
' yes , of course , yes , he ’s the president … he ’s done great things , ' one of the supporters said			0
' he 's doing great things			2
great things , ' another voice said in response			0
@entity6 's refusal to speak to the tracker is not surprising given his party affiliation and the nature of his question			1
but the @entity1 candidate 's non-answer could come back to haunt her in her close race against businessman @entity68			1
multiple polls conducted in late september and early october had @entity68 leading @entity6 by several digits			1
a new @entity72 poll released on wednesday shows a reversal , with @entity6 now up by three points			2
the race could just as easily flip back in @entity68 's favor in the next two and a half weeks , however , and pollsters expect this race to be a nail biter			1
@entity6 is the daughter of former @entity24 senator @entity80 , a notable @entity81 who has given thousands of dollars to @entity4 's election efforts			1
she 's currently on leave of absence from her day job as ceo of @entity24 - based non-profit organization @entity87			0
@entity68 is the cousin of former @entity24 gov. @entity88 , also a @entity10			1
the self - funded , former @entity90 head defeated @entity10 congressman @entity91 in a brutal primary this summer to win the @entity10 nomination			2
@entity6 and @entity68 are competing to replace retiring @entity10 politician @entity94			1
a third , @entity96 candidate , @entity95 , is also vying for the seat and could prove a spoiler on @entity99			0
@entity95 is steadily polling at five percent of the vote			0
if neither @entity6 or @entity68 is able to win 50 percent of the vote , @entity24 law calls for a run - off election that wo n't be held until early next year when other newly elected senators are already descending on @entity104 to begin the new legislative session			1
@entity106 , right , and her family participate in early voting on wednesday in @entity23			0
@entity6 is running against @entity10 @entity68			1
the two are virtually tied two and a half weeks ahead of the election neither major political party wants an extended campaign season lasting into 2015 , and both the @entity113 and the @entity114 are pouring loads of cash into the race on behalf of their respective candidates			0
earlier this week the @entity114 announced that it would go dark in @entity43 , where its candidate repeatedly stumbled over questions about her support for @entity4 , in order to shift $ 1 million into @entity6 's race in @entity24			1
ironically , @entity6 could become the next victim of the ' did she or did n't she ' vote for @entity4 conundrum that has plagued @entity43 's @entity42			1
@entity42 and @entity6 are hardly alone in their attempts to distance themselves from their party head , whose approval rating is at a career low , according to an @entity135 / @entity134 poll that came out on wednesday			1
@entity137 sen. @entity136 , @entity139 sen. @entity138 , @entity141 sen. @entity140 , @entity143 sen. @entity142 , @entity145 sen. @entity144 and @entity147 sen. @entity146 have all went out of their way to avoid being associated with @entity4 this year as they wage reelection bids			0
@entity140 is the senator who was supposed to appear at a july fundraiser with @entity4 , then cancelled at the last minute to stay in @entity104			0
he claimed at a debate in september that the ' @entity158 when they look down the front lawn the last person they want to see coming is me			0
' @entity3 candidates bearing @entity4 's party @entity161 are avoiding the president like the plague			1
as a result , @entity4 , who is seen here delivering remarks during a cabinet level meeting at the @entity158 on wednesday , has n't made a single public appearance on behalf of a @entity1 contender this fall another @entity141 @entity81 , gov. @entity170 , is now claiming that he was never a proponent of @entity4 's signature healthcare reform law			1
at a debate last night against @entity10 @entity173 , @entity170 said while talking about health care , ' and again , i 'm not big fan of the @entity177 , i would n't have designed it that ... ' he stopped short of finishing his sentence as he was both interrupted by his opponent and booed by members of the live audience			2
picking up where he left off , @entity170 asserted that like many governors , he would have preferred a state - by - state approach to healthcare reform ' and not had a roll out with that much detail			0
' ' and all of us are working together , the governors			0
to try and figure out how to get waivers , ' he said			0
as his @entity10 opponent immediately pointed out on @entity193 after the debate , @entity170 was singing a slightly different tune when the @entity196 ruled in 2012 that the individual mandate portion of @entity177 was constitutional			2
a press release from @entity170 's office on the decision says that ' the @entity177 helped build on the work of the state ’s @entity203 and provided increased funding to make comprehensive reform possible			0
' a number of important aspects of the law are already improving the lives of many @entity211 based on implementation of the @entity177 in @entity141 , ' the statement said and listed off a number of benefits of the federal healthcare reform law			0
also included in the press release is a direct quote from @entity170 praising the legislation			0
' more coloradans will benefit when the @entity177 is fully implemented in 2014 , ' he said			0
the @entity1 governor did point out his own state 's efforts to improve health care for its residents , independent of the federal healthcare law , throughout the press release , however			2
once considered a rising star of the @entity1 , @entity170 is trailing @entity173 by four points , per a @entity228 poll that came out yesterday			2
the incumbent governor is gaining on @entity173 , who was once ahead by 10 points , but he the race still leans heavily in @entity173 's favor			2
like @entity140 , @entity170 also skipped events with @entity4 when the president was in town this summer			0
he memorably grabbed a beer and shot pool with the president when they bumped into each other at a local bar , however			0
@entity4 won both games .			0

when confronted by a tracker for a @entity10 outfit yesterday , @entity7 candidate @entity6 stayed mum about her voting history
the same question has tripped up fellow @entity1 @entity3 candidate @entity42 of @entity43
@entity6 's non-answer could come back to haunt her in her close race against businessman @entity68
