@entity0 admits @entity1 have failed to produce the kind of attractive football their fans have become accustomed to this season			1
@entity1 sit third in the @entity6 and are in the quarter - finals of the @entity8 after a sequence of just one defeat in 19 matches			2
yet despite that run , @entity1 manager @entity12 has come in for criticism in recent weeks			1
@entity0 admits @entity1 have failed to produce the kind of attractive football their fans want @entity16 branded @entity18 's team ' @entity17 ' , @entity15 said his former club had often played ' miserable ' football this season and fans at @entity23 recently whistled at their own team			1
the @entity1 supporters have been spoiled after watching more than two decades of largely enterprising football under sir @entity27 , and @entity0 understands why criticism has been directed at the team this year			1
when asked whether he had been surprised by the criticism @entity1 had received , the defender said : ' no. i think as players we know that we could perform better			1
' i think the manager wants us to play more attractive football			1
' @entity35 talks to @entity1 team - mates @entity36 and @entity0 during the defeat of @entity39 there was little sign of improvement on monday night when @entity1 had to come from behind to beat @entity39 3 - 1 at @entity43			1
@entity18 's team did not have a shot on target until the second half and they only kicked into life when @entity18 replaced @entity49 with @entity50 and altered the formation to a regular 4 - 4 - 2			0
@entity0 believes the team is improving though			2
' i think we are seeing progress , ' the @entity53 said			0
' you can see that with the performances			0
' at the start of season we were not playing well and we were not getting results but the manager has got us organised and everyone knows their jobs			0
@entity12 has faced criticism over the tactics he has employed at @entity1 ' i think once we get that cemented then we can go and start entertaining again			1
' once we get the ball down show our composure i think the football will be attractive			2
' @entity1 sealed a quarter - final clash against @entity73 thanks to goals from @entity35 , @entity75 and @entity76 , who converted a controversial 88th minute penalty			2
@entity0 , who was also at the stadium for the launch , thinks @entity1 were more deadly at @entity43 when @entity80 was moved out on to the wing from central midfield in the second half			1
' when @entity80 was out in the wide position it allowed him to run at the full - back a bit more , ' said @entity88 , who has struggled since his £ 59.7million move from @entity90			2
' he has come from a different environment at @entity90 in a different league to work under a new manager here			0
@entity0 feels @entity94 winger @entity80 needs more time to find his best form for the club ' he has a different system he wants us to play so it will always take time			1
' i think he has been fantastic			0
we know how much of a danger he is			0
' we have seen him in training and we are hoping he can produce that on the pitch as well			0
' @entity106 , who put @entity39 ahead on monday , can only dream of taking home the kind of money @entity110 is on at @entity1			2
the left - back from @entity112 revealed that he receives a bonus of just £ 1 from his grandmother @entity114 every time he scores			0
' every time we scored as kids , she used to give me and my brothers a pound , ' @entity106 told @entity123 the day after scoring against the 20 - time @entity125 champions			0
' even though i 'm 26 now , i still carry that tradition on			0
' she was the first person i rang last night and i said ' i want that pound '			0
' i tried saying i wanted a bit more because it was against @entity1 , but she says that was n't in the contract			1
' the @entity1 defender was talking at the launch of a new club - based social media site @entity0 was speaking at the launch of @entity138 , powered by @entity139 , available to download at @entity140 .			1
