by @entity0 published : 19:53 est , 19 march 2014 updated : 19:53 est , 19 march 2014 one school playing field has been sold off every two weeks since the @entity4 , new figures have revealed			1
ministers have given the nod to 26 sales since pledging to use the games to deliver a sporting legacy for children			1
the @entity11 promised to ‘ seek to protect school playing fields ’ when it formed in may 2010			1
official figures show that 57 disposals of school fields have been authorised since 2010 , despite promises that this would not happen but official figures show that 57 have been approved for sale since then - and the pace of sell - offs quickened in the year of the @entity22			1
the government said pitches which had been approved for disposal were often unused or surplus to schools ’ requirements			2
it said the proceeds of disposals must be reinvested in either sporting or educational facilities			0
the @entity32 and @entity33 , representing more than 300 sporting organisations , said that access to decent facilities was a ‘ pre-requisite to tackling the growing crisis of inactivity among young people ’			0
the figures show that 14 sell - offs were allowed in the first year of the @entity11 and 12 between may 2011 and april 2012			0
the following year numbers had risen to 19 , and in the six months between may 2013 and october 2013 – the latest period for which figures are available – 12 had already been approved			0
the sites are often sold onto housing developers			2
despite the pledges , the spectacle and pageantry of the @entity4 has failed to save school fields around the country in six cases , the government over-ruled its own advisory body to force through sales			1
as the country celebrated @entity61 ’s success in the august 2012 @entity22 , @entity58 pledged to use the inspiration of the games to ‘ get children playing sport more regularly ’ , particularly competitive sport			1
in that year , education secretary @entity67 was forced to apologise after it emerged the number of sell - offs under the @entity11 was higher than it had previously admitted			0
he was also criticised for rejecting the advice of the @entity73 – a committee of independent experts which is legally bound to make recommendations on each sale application			0
a new report outlines disposals since may 2010 and the reasons for each			2
in 38 cases , schools closed or merged with others			2
in seven , the land was leased to other organisations , with pupils able to use it during school hours			2
in 12 cases , the land concerned was ‘ small sections of playing field … that either is n’t used by the school for sport or is not needed due to other facilities in place ’			1
the @entity99 said : ‘ no open school has disposed of its entire playing field , and in every case all of the money made by the local authority or school from the sale will be invested in local sports or education facilities			1
‘ every school must , by law , have access to enough playing field space to allow for its sports and curriculum needs to be met			1
’ it said the number of disposals was falling			0
an average of 28 applications per year were approved under the last @entity121 government , against an average of 16 annually under the @entity11			0
@entity123 , interim chief executive at the @entity32 , said it had particular concerns about the potential for land sell - offs at newly - built academies and free schools			0
