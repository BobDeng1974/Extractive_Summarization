by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:08 est , 23 may 2012 updated : 16:10 est , 25 may 2012 @entity2 has said plans to block pornography from search engines would still fail to protect @entity7 children			1
@entity8 , the company 's head of @entity7 public policy , believes the government 's plan for a bar on adult content would give parents a false sense of security and would be a ' mistake '			1
instead she says adults should always supervise younger children while they surf the internet and chat openly with them about sex as they grow up			1
protecting our youngsters : @entity25 has promised tougher restrictions on explicit music videos , violent computer games and internet porn but @entity2 say it would be a mistake ' legislation would be a mistake , ' she said at the @entity2 conference in @entity35 yesterday , adding a filter would only ' overblock or underblock ' and ' deskill ' parents			1
' the best thing we can do is make sure parents sit with their children on the internet when they 're very young and have conversations with older children about sex in general			1
' we at @entity2 also believe that children should n't be seeing pornography online			1
' what we disagree with is the mechanisms by which we protect our children			2
it 's not that easy and the solutions that are being discussed are not perfect			2
' the @entity2 executive also claimed yesterday to have ‘ no idea ’ how much money the search giant makes from advertising alongside online pornography which can be viewed by children			1
ms @entity8 pleaded ignorance during a debate hosted by @entity2 on whether to block porn on the internet to protect youngsters			1
a spokesman for the firm later said : ‘ we do not break out our revenues for any area			2
’ but it is clear that @entity2 makes thousands of pounds per day from paid - for advertising alongside search results after a user keys in a word such as ‘ porn ’ on the @entity7 site			1
@entity2 ’s own @entity78 programme , designed to help advertisers work out how much it will cost to buy the top advert next to a key word such as porn , indicates it will cost as much as £ 8,000 a day			2
power : @entity84 ceo @entity83 is in a position to filter out adult content for all searches adverts further down the list cost less , but @entity2 ’s @entity7 profits would clearly run to thousands from ads placed next to every word associated with pornography			1
worldwide profits would be far more			0
mrs @entity8 told the @entity96 media event yesterday in @entity97 that the responsibility for protecting children from pornography on the internet lies solely with parents			1
her comments fly in the face of a @entity106 campaign to protect children by blocking internet porn from computers unless an adult user specifically opts in and elects to see the content			2
@entity2 has nearly total domination of the search engine market and is in a position to filter out adult content for all searches , but it refuses to do so as it insists it is a parental responsibility			0
campaigners suggested one reason for @entity2 ’s insistence that children ’s internet use is the responsibility of their parents is the amount of money the search giant makes from porn advertising			1
@entity106 columnist @entity128 argued that the internet was ‘ full of the most debasing sado - masochistic pornography that no child should ever see ’ and said an opt - in policy was the best option			2
but mrs @entity8 , a former adviser to @entity134 on media issues , warned that legislation to filter pornography on the internet was a ‘ mistake , absolutely ’			1
fortune - maker : the boards at the @entity142 change one by one as @entity84 begins trading at the @entity142 in @entity144 in @entity145 concerns over @entity2 ’s creeping intrusion into private life were heightened yesterday when its executive chairman said it would like to know even more about its @entity150 told the @entity96 event that knowing who users ’ friends were and what they cared about would improve its services			0
‘ do n’t you think that @entity2 search – with your permission , i need to say very precisely – will do a better job if we have more information that singles you out – who you are , what you care about – in terms of search results ? ’ he asked.his words will strike a sinister note for civil liberties campaigners who already believe that @entity2 harvests too much information about its users			0
@entity173 , director of @entity174 , said : ‘ sadly it is impossible for the average person to figure out what data @entity2 is collecting and how it is being used , a problem exacerbated by the company ’s pursuit of combining data from across its services			0
‘ as far as companies like @entity2 are concerned , you and i are not their customers , we are their product			0
’ asked about the amount of money pornography brings in for @entity2 , which makes almost all of its profits through advertising , mrs @entity8 said : ‘ i have no idea			1
we do n’t go out of our way to make money from pornography			0
‘ like all search engines , we do allow advertisers to place adverts alongside searches that show adult content			0
‘ but it ’s legal			0
let ’s just be clear			0
i do n’t see the problem with that as long as we put in place sufficient safeguards , as much as we can , for children			2
’ the event , at the five - star @entity208 , was hosted by @entity211 figures and free copies of the @entity213 were handed out			0
the @entity2 spokesman added : ‘ like other search engines , our policies allow ads to appear next to search results that contain links to legal pornography			0
' we also place ads on other people ’s web pages but not on pornographic sites			0
‘ we understand that some people do n’t want to see this material , or have their kids stumble upon it			0
‘ @entity2 ’s @entity230 screens for adult websites and advertising and removes them from search results			0

@entity7 public policy boss @entity8 says legislation would be a ' mistake '
' better for parents to sit with children online and have conversations with older children about sex , ' she says
