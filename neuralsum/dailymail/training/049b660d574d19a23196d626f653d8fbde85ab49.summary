by @entity0 published : 12:12 est , 22 november 2013 updated : 12:53 est , 22 november 2013 named ' little armoured one ' by the @entity3 , armadillos are notoriously guarded characters			2
and this new - born creature is no different			2
greeting the world for the first time since his birth on september 26 in @entity10 , near @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity6 took some coaxing to come out of his shell			1
curled up : three - banded baby armadillo @entity6 could be a wooden ball as far as onlookers are concerned greeting ? he was born in @entity17 , @entity11 , on september 26 but this was to be the moment he met the world nudge : thankfully , his father , @entity21 , is there to give @entity6 a nudge and he starts to gradually unravel zoo keepers were eager to display the infant - a rarity in @entity27			1
but for a few minutes , they could easily have been staring at a static , wooden ball			0
with the help of his father , @entity21 , @entity6 eventually satisfied the crowds by peeking his nose out to see what the fuss was about			2
like anteaters and sloths , armadillos were originally confined to @entity37			0
slowly but surely : bit by bit @entity6 satisfies the eager zoo keepers , who want to display their rare new creature @entity41 : armadillos got their name from the @entity44 - speaking @entity3 , meaning ' little armoured one ' recoil : he soon slipped back into his shell			1
there are many kinds , but this is the only one that can curl into a ball over time a small number migrated to @entity55 , but it was n't until the advent of zoos that @entity27 became acquainted with the hard - shelled animals			0
@entity6 and @entity21 are members of @entity27 's most common form of armadillo : three - banded , meaning their shell is formed of three segments			1
@entity65 is home to its cousins with more complex shells , including the nine - banded armadillo and the northern - naked tailed armadillo			0
but three - banded is the only kind that can curl into a ball to hide from predators .			0

@entity6 was born in @entity17 in @entity11 , @entity12 , on september 26
when he was *unveiled* to the world on *thursday* , he curled into his shell
the name ' armadillo ' *translates* as ' little armoured one ' in @entity44
