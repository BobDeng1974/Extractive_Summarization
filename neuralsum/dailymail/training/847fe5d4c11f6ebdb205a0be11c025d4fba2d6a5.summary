a shocking advertising campaign for fashion brand @entity1 has been banned for ‘ sexualising school - age girls ’			1
photographs of its ‘ @entity7 ’ range included a young woman bending over in an ultra- short tartan skirt with her white underwear on display			1
in a scathing attack , the advertising watchdog labelled the campaign ‘ gratuitous ’ and ‘ sexist ’			2
it also accused the firm of promoting seedy ‘ up - skirt ’ photographs – when unauthorised pictures are taken from beneath a woman ’s skirt			1
the brand launched its @entity32 range earlier this month with the slogan , ‘ your first assignment is to dress accordingly			2
’ the campaign included pictures of a model bent over touching the ground , revealing her crotch and underwear , while another showed a woman bending over a red car in a thigh - skimming green tartan skirt and her buttocks on show			1
the @entity20 said : ‘ we considered the images were gratuitous and objectified women , and were therefore sexist and likely to cause serious and widespread offence			1
the brand launched its @entity32 range earlier this month with the slogan , ' your first assignment is to dress accordingly ' ‘ furthermore , we considered the images imitated voyeuristic ‘ up - skirt ’ shots which had been taken without the subject ’s consent or knowledge which , in the context of an ad for a skirt marketed to young women , we considered had the potential to normalise a predatory sexual behaviour			1
’ the fact that the model ’s face was not visible meant the public would ‘ understand that the model was , or was intended to appear to be , a schoolgirl			2
’ the @entity20 concluded : ‘ we considered the ads had the effect of inappropriately sexualising school - age girls and were therefore offensive and irresponsible for that reason too			1
’ they acknowledged that @entity1 , which is popular with teenagers , ‘ had removed the images before we had contacted them ’ , but said they were ‘ nonetheless concerned that the images had appeared in their advertising at all			2
’ following objections , the firm quickly pulled the offending pictures from its @entity86 account and website			0
the company said the images were not intended to represent an underage model but had been ‘ posted by a junior and relatively inexperienced member of their social media team ’			0
the rest of its @entity7 collection – featuring models in mini-skirts , knee socks and crop tops stood next to lockers – remains online			0
@entity1 has also courted controversy previously over its promotional campaigns two garments are named ‘ the @entity104 skirt ’ and ‘ the @entity105 ’ , in a possible reference to the sexualised schoolgirl in @entity109 ’s novel ‘ @entity104 ’			1
last year , the retailer was labelled ‘ sexist ’ and ‘ sleazy ’ for an advertisement for a unisex shirt which showed half - naked women alongside fully clothed male models			0
the business now has 10,000 employees and 249 stores in 20 countries , including the @entity119 and the @entity120			0
@entity1 ( @entity120 @entity121 said its images featured non-airbrushed everyday people ‘ and their approach was not graphic , explicit or pornographic			0
’ the brand said ‘ their models were happy , relaxed and confident in expression and pose and were not portrayed in a manner which was vulnerable , negative or exploitative			0
’ it also argued it was well - known for its provocative campaigns and customers were well aware of this before they chose to actively follow @entity1 ’s social media accounts or browse its website .			0

photographs of ‘ @entity7 ’ range included young woman bending over
wearing an ultra- short tartan skirt with her white underwear on display
( @entity20 ) said ‘ focus was on er buttocks and groin rather than on skirt ’
