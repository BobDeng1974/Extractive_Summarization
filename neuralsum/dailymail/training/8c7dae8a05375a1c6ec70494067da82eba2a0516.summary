potent : this drink contains an even more potent concentration of two of the strongest antioxidants ever discovered , scientists claim forget the health benefits of olives and olive oil – the latest boost to wellbeing is the humble olive leaf			1
it was once a folk remedy revered by the @entity12 , while ancient @entity13 used it for mummifying royalty			1
but a drink made from olive leaf extract – taken from freshly picked @entity18 organic olive leaves - is the first health supplement of its kind to be launched in @entity21			1
a new scientific review in the journal @entity24 shows it contains two antioxidant compounds known to support heart health that are among the most potent yet discovered			1
@entity28 , a polyphenol produced by the olive tree , makes it particularly robust and resistant against insect and bacterial damage			0
the other compound hydroxytyrosol , is thought to be a major ingredient of virgin olive oil - one of the cornerstones of the heart - healthy @entity38 diet			2
although it is found in olives and olive oil , the highest concentrations occur in the leaf			1
the 5mg dose contained in a serving of @entity46 with @entity47 has been approved by the @entity48 ( @entity48 ) as having antioxidant activity			2
dr @entity50 , chair of the government ’s @entity51 on @entity53 , suggests the combination of hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein may hold the key to many of the health benefits associated with olives and the @entity38 diet			1
both have powerful antioxidant activity and have been shown to reduce the oxidation of ‘ bad ’ ldl cholesterol – the process that makes it hazardous to health			2
a study found a twice - a - day 500mg dose of olive extract was as effective as an ace inhibitor at reducing both diastolic and systolic blood pressure			0
unlike the prescription - only blood pressure pill , the extract also significantly lowered levels of triglycerides , blood fats linked to heart problems			0
another trial investigating the impact of olive leaf extract on blood sugar control reported a significant improvement in insulin sensitivity after just 12 weeks			0
the review also included a study in patients with type 2 diabetes which showed improved insulin levels and lower levels of a marker linked to a greater risk of diabetes - related complications			0
the review concludes : ‘ this extremely promising ingredient , olive leaf , is worthy of considerable further research			1
’ the @entity48 approval says the scientific evidence supports the consumption of olive oil because its ‘ polyphenols contributes to the protection of blood lipids from oxidative damage ’			2
@entity48 says in order to get the protective effect , 5mg of hydroxytyrosol and its derivatives including oleuropein complex should be consumed daily			0
although these amounts can be easily consumed in a balanced diet , @entity48 says ‘ the concentrations in some olive oils may be too low ’ to reach the target			0
also worthwhile : olive oil and olives also contain the antioxidants but the new drink is touted as preferable nutritionist dr @entity120 said ‘ the mass of evidence demonstrates these olive polyphenols have a powerful antioxidant effect			1
‘ we ’ve known about the health benefits of olive oil for a long time , and there is evidence of traditional use of olive leaf for healing , but this review confirms the importance of hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein			1
’ ‘ i think this is definitely a case of watch this space			0
‘ these antioxidants appear to have a very broad activity so it ’s likely that further research will confirm even more health benefits			2
’ she said the new product could provide twice the daily dose backed by @entity48 in a form that was easily digestible			0
‘ @entity149 is virtually fat free , has no added sugar and is created as an infusion of spring water , which means it mixes easily with juices , smoothies and herbal tea and is suitable for those who avoid alcohol ’ she said .			0
