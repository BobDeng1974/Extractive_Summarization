by @entity0 published : 05:21 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 08:08 est , 30 january 2013 a 14 - year race discrimination court battle has cost the taxpayer almost a million pounds			1
equality campaigner @entity3 won £ 420,000 in compensation after a council - funded anti-racism group turned her down for a job			1
top employment judge @entity9 said qualified barrister ms @entity3 's long legal fight with the @entity12 of @entity13 was ' a 21st century version of a 19th @entity16 saga '			2
@entity17 now faces legal bills which may even exceed the amount of @entity3 's payout he compared the lengthy proceedings to a ' dickensian narrative of allegations and counter-allegations , applications and cross-applications , misunderstandings , objections , complaints , hearings , adjournments , reviews , appeals and cross-appeals '			1
the row began in june 1999 when 58 - year - old ms @entity3 , from @entity37 , north @entity38 , applied for a job as a training and development coordinator and race discrimination case worker with @entity42 ( @entity42 )			1
@entity9 said the case was like a 19th century saga she was turned down for the post with the charitable advice service , partly funded by @entity13 , following an interview in july that year			0
within months she had started proceedings against both @entity42 , alleging victimisation under sex and race discrimination legislation			2
she claimed that she had been treated unfairly in the interview because she had already brought a discrimination case against @entity42 after being turned down following a previous job interview			2
in april 2002 she was awarded £ 15,076 by an employment tribunal in relation to that original complaint			1
in june 2003 the tribunal found that @entity42 and the @entity17 were liable to pay out for victimisation of ms @entity3 in relation to both interviews			1
in 2007 she was awarded £ 1,905.41 against one of her interviewers in relation to ' injury to feelings caused by race discrimination '			1
then , in 2009 , she was handed a £ 421,415 payout against the @entity17			2
the total sum included £ 262,026 for financial loss , £ 15,000 for injury to feelings , £ 25,000 for injury to health and £ 25,000 aggravated damages plus interest and costs			1
@entity13 appealed , with its barrister @entity76 arguing that the payout 's impact on the council and public funds was ' disproportionate			0
' a judge said the et had been entitled to find the @entity17 liable for the full amount of ms @entity3 's compensation @entity87 ' @entity86 , written between 1852 and 1853 , revolves around a long - running litigation in @entity90 's @entity89			1
the plot centres on a complex and tangled court case which involves a large inheritance with many potential beneficiaries			0
the novel explains how the case has dragged on for so many generations that , when it is eventually resolved , the legal costs spent trying to award the right person the inheritance have devoured the entire estate			0
the writer used the novel as a scathing attack on the chancery court system , painting it as an almost worthless institution which drags out cases for incredibly long periods of time			0
he argued it was unfair for the @entity17 to be landed with such a huge bill - not to mention 12 years - worth of lawyers ' fees - when a ' very much smaller sum ' was awarded against the interviewer who mr @entity116 described as ' the primary discriminator			1
' @entity9 , giving his decision on the appeal , expressed surprise at the sums involved , saying : ' on the face of it £ 421,415 seems to be a great deal of money to compensate ms @entity3 for acts of discrimination in two unsuccessful job interviews			1
' however , dismissing @entity13 's appeal , the judge said the tribunal had been entitled to find the council liable for the full amount of ms @entity3 's compensation			2
the court defeat is a disaster for @entity13 which now faces enormous legal costs bills which may even exceed the amount of ms @entity141 's payout			2
@entity9 acknowledged that the case had cost ' a very large amount of public money ' but refused to grant @entity13 permission to appeal further to the @entity146			0
a spokesman for @entity17 said : ' we are disappointed with the outcome and are studying the judgement to decide our next step			2
' the payout is merely the latest for ms @entity3 , who has successfully taken various bodies - mainly anti-racism groups - to court over more than 25 years			1
her first grievance came when she was working as a race adviser at @entity38 's @entity157			0
she accused a @entity159 colleague of being ' macho and intimidating '			0
many of her cases were taken against organisations - including @entity163 's - that turned her down for jobs			0
others were against a housing association that failed to move her into a bigger home and even an employment tribunal judge			0
in 2002 , she won a five - figure sum against a black law centre , forcing it to close amid acrimony and financial ruin			0
her father @entity173 , director of the @entity174 think tank , told the @entity176 : ' her actions have been unconscionable			0
she has taken money from the organisations i have fought to help			0

equality campaigner @entity3 is awarded £ 420,000 after 14 - year court battle with @entity17 and @entity42 for racial equality
with legal fees , final bill could cost taxpayers almost a million pounds
@entity190 included £ 262,026 for financial loss and £ 15,000 for injury to feelings
