@entity1 ’s wish appears to have come true , with the @entity2 set to make him the @entity4 ’s highest - paid defensive player			1
after the @entity6 declined to use the franchise tag on @entity1 to save $ 26.5m of cap space , the @entity2 look to have beaten @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 to the most coveted signature in this year ’s free agency			1
@entity1 will on tuesday sign a $ 114million , six - year deal with around $ 60m guaranteed , @entity17 report			1
with no state taxes in @entity20 , the deal dwarfs @entity22 ’s current six - year , $ 100m deal which the @entity24 ’ defensive end penned last year			2
@entity1 will on tuesday sign a $ 114million with the @entity2 with $ 60million guaranteed @entity1 , the second pick of the 2010 draft , is a four time pro-bowler and three - time first team @entity28 and led the @entity6 with 8.5 sacks last season			1
at 28 , @entity1 is in his prime and is a once - in - a decade type of player whom the @entity2 can build their franchise around			2
a fearsome pass rusher , he was the cornerstone of @entity4 ’s best rushing defense and helped the @entity6 to the play - offs last year			1
he will join the likes of @entity40 and @entity41 in an aggressive front four			0
in his five years in @entity42 , @entity1 played 80 out of 82 games			0
he was suspended for both of those for stamping on @entity46 of the @entity47 in 2011			0
veterans such as @entity49 ( right ) were among those released by the @entity2 to free up cap space following his exit , the focus for the @entity6 front office will be getting fellow defensive tackle @entity55 to stay			1
after declining his fifth - year option last year due to injury concerns , the 26 - year - old is considered the second - best free agent defensive tackle			2
should @entity1 depart , which appears likely , they will need a run - stuffer alongside him			0
the free - spending dolphins had a roster clear - out which paved the way for @entity1 ’s arrival			0
veterans such as @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity49 were among those released to free up cap space			0

free agency opens on tuesday and if he signs , as @entity17 report , it will make him the @entity4 ’s highest paid defensive player
a *dominant* defensive tackle , @entity1 is an aggressive pass rusher and run stuffer
@entity1 looks likely to leave @entity42 after five years with the @entity6 , where they reached the play - offs twice
