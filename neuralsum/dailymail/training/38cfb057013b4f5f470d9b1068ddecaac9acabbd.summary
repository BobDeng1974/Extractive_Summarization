by @entity0 @entity1 : 06:48 est , 24 december 2013 @entity2 : 10:32 est , 24 december 2013 action : 7,500 workers will protest against a 1 % below - inflation pay rise by walking out next tuesday thousands of police civilian staff , including 999 call handlers , will strike on @entity9			1
the @entity12 ( @entity11 ) union today revealed 7,500 workers will walk out in protest against their one per cent pay rise , well below inflation			1
timed to coincide with a walkout by @entity19 firefighters , the announcement has sparked fears for safety on one of the busiest days of the year			1
police and community support officers , 999 call handlers , detention officers in custody suites , and a range of administration and professional support staff are among those who would take action			0
the @entity31 has already cancelled leave for police officers and is making contingency plans			1
the @entity11 said the strike was voted for by almost three to one			0
however the @entity31 ( @entity36 ) said just one in 12 police staff voted for strike action			2
@entity40 of the @entity11 said : ' police staff feel undervalued and underpaid			0
we have members forced to take second jobs , or use payday loans , just to keep afloat			0
' our demands are entirely reasonable - last year the @entity31 saved over Â £ 50 million on the police staff budget due to job cuts			2
' just some of that money should be used to fund a decent pay rise , and they are calling on the commissioner and the deputy mayor to demonstrate that they genuinely value the hard work and commitment of police staff			2
' the @entity31 described the one per cent pay rise as being ' at the ceiling of the government 's public sector pay policy and the pay increase was given without any strings attached to it '			1
it claimed the @entity11 's demands include a pay increase of up to six per cent			0
a @entity31 spokesman said : ' the @entity11 has now informed the @entity36 that they intend to take strike action on @entity9 - one of the days when demand for our services is highest			1
the @entity31 has cancelled leave for officers to accommodate on one of the year 's busiest days ( file picture ) ' we have tried - and - tested business continuity plans for all eventualities , including industrial action			1
these ensure that critical functions performed by police staff are performed by police officers who are fully trained in those roles			2
' to ensure we are able to implement these plans , we stopped granting any further requests for annual leave or days off for officers and staff in a number of key areas for @entity9 in mid-december			0
' in some cases we 've also had to take the very difficult decision to cancel planned days off for officers with certain critical skills or in critical operational areas			0
' these are clearly all steps we 'd rather not take , but we have to be prepared to maintain critical operational areas in the event of a strike action by police staff , and we are confident that we have appropriate plans in place			0

7,500 workers will walk out over below - inflation 1 % pay rise , @entity11 revealed
fears for safety as action coincides with @entity19 firefighters strike next week
@entity31 has cancelled leave for police officers to accommodate
