the @entity0 put the first man on the moon , but in a strange twist of history it appears the @entity5 may have beat @entity0 in settling @entity6			2
experts proposed this new theory in a recently released 200 - page report on the @entity10 , a structure they believe could have been built as early as 1795 - ten years before @entity12 reached the @entity13			1
historic building repairer @entity14 and architectural historian @entity16 have been analyzing the log cabin for seven years and say it is unlike anything else found in @entity6			1

the way the logs are tightly interwoven , secured without nails and leaving no gaps to fill , is similar to @entity5 log cabins of the same time period , when @entity47 was sending envoys to @entity35 to boost the fur trade			1
@entity50 and @entity16 hypothesize that the 18 - foot - wide cabin could have been a home for a small group of 10 to 50 @entity5 settlers sent to @entity6 's @entity32 as farmers to feed the fur trappers on @entity35 's @entity57			1

@entity50 and @entity16 are currently trying to find a permanent place to house the cabin the first mobile home : @entity50 discovered that the original builders of the cabin wrote numbers into the boards , so that the structure could be disassembled and reassembled expert craftsmanship : the boards fit perfectly together so that nothing is needed to fill in the gaps and winterize the structure for winter many uses : throughout its storied life , the @entity10 has been used as a home , animal shelter , machine shed and granary preserved : the structure was made a historical landmark in 1991 and moved in doors in 2007 when the wood was starting to succumb to the elements current home : above , the structure as it sits today in a storage facility where @entity50 has been working to preserve the cabin ' the unique construction and extraordinary craftsmanship of the @entity23 offer fascinating clues to a mystery that we did n't even know existed about the earliest white exploration and settlement of the @entity102 , ' @entity96 , executive director of @entity97 , a non-profit helping fund the research , told the @entity103			2
' it may well add a new chapter to our history and we hope more evidence will be uncovered to further substantiate @entity16 and @entity14 's very compelling theory , ' @entity96 added			0
@entity50 and @entity16 are now hoping to find a permanent location to house the structure , as well as someone with a deeper knowledge of @entity115 construction to analyze the cabin			0
@entity5 expansion : @entity5 merchant @entity118 founded a fur trading settlement on @entity57 in 1784			2
above , a rendering of the port business on the @entity35 frontier : above , a 1794 drawing of the @entity5 fur trading post in @entity127 , @entity35 @entity128 : @entity5 's @entity47 encouraged the expansion of her empire to @entity35 for fur trading above , a map shows where @entity5 traders set up fur trading business in @entity35 , and their possible farming settlement near @entity6 throughout its storied life , the @entity10 has been used as a home , animal shelter , machine shed and granary			1
it was made a historic landmark in 1991 and moved to a storage facility in 2008 to protect it from further erosion			0
the oldest evidence of habitation in are the @entity151 and @entity152 in @entity153 , @entity6 , which date back 13,200 years			0

their presence in @entity6 's early pioneer history is evidence in the many @entity165 names throughout the state including @entity176 , the @entity178 and @entity179 rivers and the city of @entity181 .			2

new report says @entity10 could have been built as early as 1795
@entity12 reached the @entity13 in 1805

@entity192 's *authors* propose the cabin could have been used by @entity5 settlers farming in the area to support fur traders in @entity35
