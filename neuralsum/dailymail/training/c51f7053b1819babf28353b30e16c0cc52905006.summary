walk to freedom : rogue trader @entity1 leaves @entity2 near @entity3 rogue trader @entity1 , who cost his bank nearly € 5billion , has walked free from a @entity6 prison today - after serving just four months of a five - year jail term			1
the 37 - year - old , who nearly brought @entity10 - one of @entity12 's biggest banks - to its knees with wildly risky trades , was released from @entity6 's @entity2 near @entity3			1
his first thought was for his mother , whom he said he ' could n't wait ' to call			2
' i am super happy to leave today ... i want to rebuild my life			0
i want to have a normal life with my loved ones , start a family and finally be able to enjoy life , ' @entity1 told reporters as he left the prison			0
branded a crook by his ex-employer and a scapegoat by his apologists , @entity1 has insisted his bosses knew what he was doing and turned a blind eye to possible breaches of rules as long as the profits kept rolling in			2
even as he racked up billions for the bank in its skyscraper in @entity3 's @entity38 business district , @entity1 lived modestly in a small suburban flat and took the train to @entity41 during the holidays to visit his widowed mother			1
' i am an ordinary person			0
i am not crazy , ' he said during investigations into the scandal after @entity10 was driven to unwind € 50billion of risky deals that it blames on him			1
' i did n't earn millions and i did n't drive a @entity50 , ' said @entity1 , who was paid € 50,000 a year plus tens of thousands more in bonuses when the scandal erupted in january 2008			2
' have you seen my apartment ? forty - five square metres ( 485 square feet ) , no masters ' paintings			0
@entity59 furniture , ' he added			0
some commentators have interpreted his big risk - taking as motivated by the desire to prove himself , a young man from a modest background , among the ranks of high - flying traders from elite schools			0
@entity10 says he worked out how to circumvent complex risk - control mechanisms and its lawyer @entity71 accused him of ' duplicity ' in reassuring his employers that all was well			1
@entity1 joined @entity10 in 2000 and , five years later , was promoted to the ' front office ' to trade futures on @entity12 share indices - effectively betting on the direction of the stock market			1
colleagues at the time described him as a quiet loner			0
free after four months : the former trader , left , was greeted at the prison gates by his lawyer @entity84 the rogue trader spent 38 days in custody after his arrest in 2008 and later took up a job at a small it company in a suburb of @entity3			1
he said ahead of his initial trial that he hoped it would teach people the lessons of the global financial crisis			0
' respect for work , solidarity , honesty - i grew up with these notions			0
but when i became a trader , i lost part of these morals			2
' call home : the trader , above , told reporters he ' could n't wait ' to speak to his mother after being released he even visited @entity108 to highlight the ' tyranny of the markets ' , securing an audience with @entity112			1
under the terms of his release , he must wear an electronic tagging bracelet that will track his movements and he has to be at home between the hours of 8:30pm and 7:00am			0
but the @entity3 appeals court , who authorised @entity1 's release , said the trader will have freedom of movement on weekends and during the day on weekdays			1
he has also been ordered to pay € 4.9billion in damages - seen as an unlikely possibility .			2
