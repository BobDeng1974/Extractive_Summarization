technology now in use by the @entity2 may be picking up stray conversations			1
three hundred @entity5 microphones are being placed in high crime areas of the @entity7 and @entity8 , with the aim of alerting police immediately when they overhear the sound of gunshots			1
however , the devices pick up more that just the bang of shots being fired in potential crimes , and evidence from conversations they 've listened in on has been used in court			2
above , mayor @entity24 speaks about the system the @entity5 system works by sending a few seconds of audio to police departments along with location information after a potential gunshot system makes it through a filtering process audio recordings from @entity5 have been used to corroborate testimony that led to convictions in a 2011 @entity37 murder where a voice was heard shouting ' no @entity39 , no @entity40 ! ' before shots were fired			1
@entity2 officials and @entity22 mayor @entity24 announced a pilot program for the microphones earlier this week			1
sensors in seven districts of the @entity7 have already begun working , and the devices will be turned on in ten districts of @entity8 on monday , according to the @entity50			0
' this gunshot detection system is going to do a world of good in terms of going after the bad guys , ' de @entity24 said			2
the devices are thought to help police respond more quickly and help authorities pin point the exact location of shootings after potential gunshot recordings are sent through the company 's headquarters in @entity63			0
@entity5 says that its devices ' are specifically designed to be triggered by loud explosive or ' impuslive ' sounds only			2
' three microphones must be triggered to start an alert and triangulate a location			1
the company says that human voices , slamming car doors and loud music will not trigger the microphones , which then send summary data about a sound to the company			2
the @entity5 system ( above ) filters out noises such as car door slams and yelling before sending alerts to the police recordings of a human voice captured by the @entity5 system were used to get a conviction in a @entity37 murder case it states that there is no ' live streaming ' of any microphones apart from the few seconds of regular audio sent to its employees for further analysis about whether the sound may have been a firecracker or a gunshot			1
an alert , location data and a few seconds of audio are then sent to local police			0
the restrictions on triggering events have not stopped some privacy advocates from saying that evidence procured by the @entity104 may violate the @entity106 protection against unreasonable searches and seizures			0
' if [ @entity5 ] is recording voices out in public , it needs to be shut down , ' the @entity110 's @entity109 told take part			2
he said his organization is ' always concerned about secondary uses of technology that is sold to us for some unobjectionable purpose and is then used for other purposes			0
' @entity120 has adopted a two - year pilot program for $ 1.5million after @entity5 was used in other @entity123 cities such as @entity124 and @entity125 concerns have also been raised about the intrusiveness of audio recording being combined with surveillance video , according to the @entity130			1
@entity5 's website said that ' 3 out of approximately 3 million incidents ' have been latched onto by ' privacy zealots ' and that the voices in those cases were yelling loudly in a public street during a shooting rather than having a private conversation			1
the company 's technology is already being used in major cities such as @entity124 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity125 and @entity144			0
its use has revealed that the vast majority of verified gunshots it picks up are never reported to police			0
however , it has also been accused of wasting police resources			0
seventy - five per cent of the alerts issued in @entity154 , @entity155 , were false alarm , according to @entity157			0
the two - year @entity22 pilot program for @entity5 will cost $ 1.5million			1
sensors are often placed on buildings and poles .			0

@entity5 microphones detect gunshots and triangulate location
technology uses filtering process to *eliminate* car door slams and yelling
*snippet* of a sound was used to get @entity37 murder conviction
@entity175 says no private conversations are being *monitored* by its system
@entity22 is beginning pilot program for $ 1.5million
