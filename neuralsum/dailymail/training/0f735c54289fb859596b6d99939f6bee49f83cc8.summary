@entity0 has delivered his seal of approval to @entity3 and insisted the striker deserves to be back in the @entity6 squad			1
the @entity8 superstar took a verbal swipe at @entity10 last year when he suggested the 22 - year - old should do more on the pitch and less talking to the media			1
now , however , @entity0 admits the on - loan @entity15 forward has stepped up to the mark with nine goals in 10 games since moving north from @entity20			1
does that mean he has listened ? ‘ he has played , made many goals and it ’s good that he lets his feet speak			1
that ’s the way he should go on , let your feet speak for themselves			1
you just have to continue			1
‘ the doors have always been open , and it ’s about how you are performing in your club team			1
it ’s all about how you perform in your club team			1
‘ @entity3 has done so wonderfully well in the @entity42			1
that ’s how he should go on			1
’ @entity3 now hopes to get the chance to link with @entity0 in @entity6 ’s forthcoming games against @entity46 and @entity47			1
despite the past criticism sent in his direction , @entity10 regards his national captain as an inspiration			1
‘ i do n’t know him really well , ’ he said			1
‘ we ’re not buddies who go out for coffee			1
@entity0 revealed he is pleased that @entity24 team - mate @entity3 ' lets his feet speak ' ‘ but he is an amazing player and probably the best @entity6 has ever had			1
‘ he is our captain and someone we respect on and off the pitch			2
of course , he is someone you look up to and strive to be like			2
‘ is he better than @entity61 ? i do n’t know , it ’s tight			2
i think @entity61 was unbelievable but @entity0 is hard to beat in @entity6			1
‘ he has his own stamp , his own word in the dictionary			2
he is pretty big ... ‘ i have read his book			2
it ’s one of the few books i have read			2
it ’s the only book i ’ve read ! ‘ it ’s a great story , a great book to read			2
he is a great character in @entity24 football			2
‘ as i said , i do n’t really hang out with him but he has been alright with me			2
@entity3 has been in sensational form for @entity15 , scoring nine goals in 10 games ‘ we play the same position so he is always good talking to you			1
‘ will i ever write a book like @entity0 ? i will have to go and train harder if i want to do that because i have a lot to live up to ! ‘ i do n’t know , i just try to stay in the present and work hard			1
i think a book is far away			2
’ @entity86 does n’t come easy to @entity3 and he insisted he does n’t change his demeanour when @entity0 is around			1
‘ i ’m always myself , ’ he said			2
‘ if you try to walk through life always trying to change for other people then you will have nothing to do other than be an absolute schizophrenic			0
you will be trying to be someone else all the time			0
‘ you just have to be yourself			0
if someone does n’t like you then at the end of the day that is their problem , not your problem			0
you can only be who you are and i have been the same person since i grew up , really			0
i was a cocky little s * * t when i was three and i ’m a cocky little s * * t now			0
the @entity15 striker believes @entity0 is ' probably the best striker @entity6 has ever had ' ‘ it ’s just me			1
either you love me or you hate me but i am always going to be myself			0
‘ i do it with a good heart			0
i try to do it with love			0
’ @entity10 ’s prolific loan spell with @entity109 aged 19 saw the @entity24 media tag him as the next @entity0			1
yet his progress was stalled – and his career placed in doubt – following a virus which attacked his nervous system following a bout of food poisoning			0
it is only now , at @entity119 , that he is back in regular football and trying to live up to the expectations of his homeland			0
‘ i do n’t know if it ’s pressure , ’ he said			0
‘ people will always say or write that i ’m destroying my career , that i ’m injured and asking why is he staying at @entity20 , blah , blah , blah			0
‘ i do n’t want to be injured			0
it ’s not that i do n’t want to play football			0
football is the best thing in the world			0
it ’s what i enjoy the most			0
@entity3 ( left ) cheekily celebrates a team - mate 's goal during a @entity6 under 21 match last month ‘ sometimes people on the outside do n’t understand the whole story			1
they have to understand that any footballer wants to play football , that he does n’t want to be injured			0
‘ i could n’t stop injuries and i always try and do my best			0
i ’ll keep doing that and hope it goes well			0
‘ being called by @entity6 is a bonus			1
it ’s an honour to be called up for your country of course			0
but we have done such great things with the under 21s that we have things to look forward to there			0
‘ we play the @entity154 next summer and the first team was not in my mind			0
i ’ve been there before and it ’s great to be back but , as i say , it ’s more of a bonus			0
