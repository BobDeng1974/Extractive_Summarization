@entity2 striker @entity1 is inching ever closer to a first - team @entity4 comeback , boss @entity0 has said			1
the 25 - year - old @entity7 international was pivotal in last season 's promotion , scoring 21 goals , but has been sidelined since march after rupturing the anterior cruciate ligament in his knee against @entity13			1
@entity2 manager @entity0 has so far been unable to pair @entity1 with @entity14 , a partnership which yielded 47 goals for him last year , but that day could come around the festive period			1
@entity2 striker @entity1 has been out since march after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament @entity1 has played two full development squad games in recent weeks and , with another pencilled in on monday against @entity21 , his return appears imminent			1
' @entity22 is on his way back , ' said @entity0 , whose men face @entity25 this weekend			1
' he got another 90 minutes in the other day so he 's right at the end of his transition back into the main first - team squad			2
we 're really pleased with that and he 's pleased with that			2
' in the grand scheme of things he 's not had four full games			2
if you 'd finished one season and gone into the next you roughly have a three - month window and during that transition back into playing again you probably have a 45 , 75 and minimum of three 90 minutes			1
that 's with normal shut - down			0
' he 's had eight and a half months out and we 've got to be mindful of that when you 're talking about true fitness and true ability to play in the first team			0
but @entity2 manager @entity0 believes @entity1 can return for his side during the @entity4 fixtures ' he 's going well , he 's feeling good and we 're really happy with that at this stage			1
' after a lengthy nine - month absence , @entity0 completely understands that @entity1 is itching to be involved in first - team affairs again as soon as possible			1
' it 's a long haul , ' said the @entity57 manager			2
' i had a few long - term injuries and it 's difficult			0
you want to be involved all of the time and you know you ca n't be			0
' there 's a lot of individual work , a lot of loneliness			0
luckily here , because of the environment we 've got , you 're almost stumbling across people			0
' he 's never felt like he 's not involved in it because there 's always some of the players around , the staff around			0
' but true involvement is playing and i 'm pleased for him that he 's back - at least playing - and now it 's moving on to the first team			0
' however , there is certainly no guarantee @entity1 picks up where he left off alongside @entity86 in @entity2 's attack			1
@entity88 ( centre ) formed a formidable partnership with @entity14 ( right ) as @entity2 won promotion last season @entity94 ' goal against @entity95 last time out moved the east @entity97 club out of the bottom three and was also the second time this season he has grabbed an important winner			1
@entity0 , though , welcomes having such selection headaches			1
' that 's a dilemma any manager wants , ' he conceded			2
' a lot was made about the financial side but we wanted a group that was demanding of each other with real true competition			0
i feel we 've definitely got that			0
' where it can take us , we 'll see			0
but we like the demand that 's in the group and @entity22 will only add to that			0
