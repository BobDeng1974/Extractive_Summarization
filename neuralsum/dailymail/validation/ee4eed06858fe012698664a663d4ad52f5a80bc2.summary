@entity1 man : the sister of captain @entity1 has defended her brother in a statement the sister of the @entity1 pilot has urged everyone to stop blaming her brother for the aircraft ’s disappearance ahead of the anniversary of the tragedy this week			1
@entity12 has released a statement in defence of her brother , captain @entity1 , who headed the crew on the missing jet , where she claims there is no proof of ' wrongdoing '			1
her statement comes as @entity23 ’s @entity22 has admitted that if the missing @entity25 plane is not found by may search efforts will go ‘ back to the drawing board ’			1
ms @entity29 's statement on behalf of the family was released through @entity31 in @entity23 , just days ahead of the one - year anniversary of the disappearance of @entity1 on sunday			1
‘ as things stand today , with no tangible evidence to show no - one , be you politician , scientist , aviation expert , plane crash investigator , pilot , retired pilot , media or whoever else , none of you have the right to blame captain @entity1 for any wrongdoing			1
’ ms @entity29 recalled how on march 8 2014 her life and the lives of all the families and friends of passengers an crew of the aircraft changed for ever			2
she recalled how at the time of the ‘ tragic occurrence of @entity1 ’ her brother , a father - of - three , was 53 years old and married to his childhood sweetheart @entity56			1
ms @entity29 described her brother as a ' doting father , generous , kind and cool with a warm sense of humour			2
he had a passion for life , for family and above all for flying			2
‘ i was n't kidding when i said that if he could he would have attached wings to himself			2
he had as much as a man could possibly want in his life ; a professional career , family , friends , health and a more than comfortable life			2
‘ he was very open - minded , coming from a family with a pretty wide range of nationalities through intermarriages			1
he got on extremely well with family members			2
the younger ones simply adored him ... their @entity80			2
‘ he was very savvy at @entity81			0
he could fix anything ; garden fixtures , floor tiles , old doors , etc. my home and the homes of my sisters and brothers are not short of the things that remind us of him every day ; framed pictures , leaking windows now repaired , a fish pond levelled up and nicely tiled , a new tv installed ... i could go on and on			0
' back to the drawing board ' : @entity23 ’s transport minister seri @entity99 has said that the search area would be extended if the missing @entity1 jet is not found by may missing : this sunday marks the one - year anniversary of the disappearance of flight mh370 still lost : the @entity106 plane was carrying 227 passengers and a crew of 12 when it suddenly disappeared off the radar on march 8 , 2014 ‘ the rollercoaster ride since march 2014 has never really stopped , except perhaps momentarily			1
i want the world to know here is a loving man who will stop at nothing to render help when it is needed			0
‘ his presence during every family function never failed to light up the occasions			0
he was always sought after by sisters , brothers , nieces and nephews alike … a man of integrity			0
he was a generous brother and uncle who often came bearing gifts from his overseas trips			0
' @entity80 was a simple village boy of humble beginnings but had high ambitions of becoming a commercial pilot			0
' with the current chatter about @entity1 involving big name media organisations like @entity135 , i feel compelled to divulge some information about captain @entity1 's scholastic ‘ prowess ’ and academic achievements			1
‘ i am doing this with some regret knowing that he would not be too happy at this disclosure			0
throughout his secondary schooling he was by no means a student genius			0
in fact he was just an average student			0
such being the situation , he certainly did n't have the right foundation to be able to figure out a scheme to hijack his own plane and then to disappear into thin air without leaving a trace			0
‘ without a doubt he had a strong sense for loyalty towards @entity25 ( @entity25 )			0
his aviation training in the @entity158 was sponsored by @entity25			0
it was there he served as a pilot and later as a training captain			1
he had an unblemished flying record of eighteen thousand plus hours , i am proud to say			0
it is sheer dedication to this profession that prompted him to set up his own home flight simulator just to equip himself in order to give a better teaching experience to his students , all at his own expense			0
‘ as a training captain he often expressed joy and satisfaction with the camaraderie he shared with all his students			1
following march 8th 2014 , we received feedback from many of these students , both locally and internationally , all in praise of his accommodating ways and generosity at sharing his knowledge			0
‘ i know for certain @entity1 opted to remain loyal to @entity25 despite a few challenging offers from other airlines that came his way			1
it was his love for family that made him want to remain with @entity25 until his retirement			0
‘ when the devastating news of @entity1 was broadcast , like everybody else , we were also in a state of shock and disbelief			1
‘ the last time we met with @entity1 was some two weeks prior to march 8th when we were together for dinner			1
he was no different from his normal , usual self			0
he was loud , jovial , and full of chuckles with his share of jokes			0
‘ we continue to pray and hope that this bizarre mystery will unravel soon			0
we stand firm in the belief that no matter how long the night , dawn will still break			0
' ms @entity29 's statement was released as @entity23 ’s transport minister seri @entity99 suggested that the search area would be extended if @entity1 is not found by may			1
this means that once again , the search will be carried out from the southern @entity213 to the @entity214 , as far west as the @entity215 and as far east - and beyond - as the @entity216			1
mr @entity99 ’s admission is unlikely to provide any comfort to the relatives of the 239 passengers and crew who were on the @entity106 when it vanished on march 8 last year about an hour into a six - hour flight from @entity223 to @entity224			1
search efforts : @entity227 ’s prime minister @entity226 said this week that the search for @entity1 off the coast of @entity227 might have to be scaled back after the year - long - search he told the @entity231 that any decision to re-strategise the search - or look again at the methods employed - would only be done if the current scouring of the ocean floor in the southern @entity213 did not find the aircraft ’s wreckage			1
‘ it is important to continue the search and hopefully we can complete it by then , ’ he said in a reference to may			1
‘ if the plane is not found we will have to evaluate the figures and rely on the experts to guide us on what to do next			1
‘ we are confident that the plane is situated in the identified search area in the south @entity213 and we are looking forward to finding it , ’ said mr @entity99 , speaking in @entity223			1
he was responding to a comment by @entity227 ’s prime minister , @entity226 , who said this week that the search and recovery effort might have to be scaled back after the year - long - search			1
‘ there is no discussion on the issue to stop the search , ’ said mr @entity99			2
‘ this is because as far as we are concerned , it is a tripartite decision ( between @entity227 , @entity23 and @entity261 ) that has made a commitment to complete the search in the 60,000 square kilometers			1
therefore it has to continue			0
’ @entity227 search director , @entity264 , told the @entity265 today that ‘ we ’re scanning continuously , 24 hours a day , seven days a week			2
' they ’re out there for six weeks at a time			0
and as we search the ground , we analyse the data and we ’re just looking everywhere for the plane			2
eventually , we ’ll find it			0
’ mr @entity264 admitted that the search team had a ‘ massive responsibility ’ to give closure to the families and everybody else who flies on an aircraft			2
theories of where the @entity25 aircraft ended up have covered numerous seas and countries , the reasons for the plane ’s disappearance ranging from the credible to the crazy			2
despite the massive search currently taking place in the southern @entity213 and requests for coastal villagers to keep their eyes open for debris that might have washed up on beaches , not a single piece of evidence from the aircraft has been found .			1
