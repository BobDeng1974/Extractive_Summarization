by @entity0 lying undiscovered in a box in an attic for nearly 40 years , these are the unseen images of the @entity5 at a photo shoot for one of their most iconic albums			2
at the height of their fame in 1971 , the band is captured chatting , laughing and occasionally @entity13 is even yawning nonchalantly as they pose for their @entity16 album cover			1
the pictures , taken by photographer @entity18 , show guitarist @entity19 in one of his first official appearances with @entity13 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
leaning stones : @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity13 , @entity24 and @entity19 in one of the 1971 images @entity28 : @entity13 in a flatcap in the photoshoot that could have been used instead of the infamous zipper in the end only a few images were ever released and the band eventually opted for their infamous and suggestive zipper cover , created by @entity36 and @entity37			1
however , the final colour image ‘ @entity39 ’ from the shoot was published and voted by @entity41 as one of the top 100 rock ’ n ’ roll photographs of all time			0
a grainy black and white image entitled ‘ @entity46 ’ with @entity13 standing to one side yawning while @entity24 scratches his nose was printed on the inside sleeve of the album – their first of the 1970s and first to be released on their new label , @entity53			1
for many critics it is the band ’s best album			2
the collection of photographs was only discovered after @entity18 ’s brother - in - law , @entity59 , also a photographer , found the negatives in a dust - covered box in his attic			2
‘ after they were found i walked around with this huge smile on my face for days , ’ says @entity18			2
‘ who would have thought 40 years later the @entity5 would still be touring ? ’ standing stones : the band appear in relaxed mood for this shot taken at the height of their fame casual : @entity13 yawns and @entity24 picks his nose in a picture that was used for the record 's inside sleeve this is one of the many images that went unseen after the shoot which was commissioned for @entity16 @entity18 , a @entity82 graduate , learnt his trade in @entity84 as an assistant to photographer and film director @entity86 , whose films include @entity88 and @entity89			1
on his return to @entity91 he made his name as an advertising photographer and was spotted by @entity94 , the filmmaker who at the time was working as a photographer ’s agent			0
the future @entity94 invited @entity18 to shoot his ‘ friends ’ the @entity5 for the cover of @entity16			1
after the band showed little interest in his original ideas , @entity18 decided to photograph them in a line up ‘ like @entity105 ’			1
he recalled : ‘ i had been advised by a photographer friend that the band “ were trouble ” to photograph and they could end up throwing v - signs to the camera			0
’ discovered : these shots of @entity22 ( right ) and @entity13 ( left ) are just two of the many photographs unearthed from negatives in a dusty box in the attic of photographer @entity18 uninterested ? they showed ' little interest ' in @entity18 's ideas until he suggested lining up ' like @entity105 ' but he found the band to be surprisingly well behaved			1
@entity18 said : ‘ they were not only compliant to my instructions in arranging them , but even seemed somewhat camera shy , which was totally unexpected			2
‘ i had to ask them to act a little more threateningly , to which they duly obliged			0
’ he then took portraits of each band member , provoking @entity13 to remark : ‘ passports is it now , mate ? ’ after the shoot , @entity18 went on to set up his own studio , directing the @entity136 - winning film @entity137 and @entity138			1
but , caught up in the excitement of transforming his dark room into a cutting room , he forgot that he had handed his brother - in - law a folder of negatives to store			0
it was in 2009 that he got a telephone call from @entity59			0
he recalls his brother - in - law saying : ‘ i ’ve found an unmarked box of negatives in the attic			0
i think they ’re your @entity5 pictures			0
