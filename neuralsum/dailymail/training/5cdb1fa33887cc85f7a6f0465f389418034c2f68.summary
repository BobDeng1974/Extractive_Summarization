by @entity0 for @entity1 an @entity3 princess who has played the characters of @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 , has submitted herself to an @entity8 on @entity9			1
@entity10 , an actress and entertainer who now works on cruise ships , describes her former job warmly as bringing ' unlimited magic feelings forever			2
' when she was n't being hit on by kids ' older relatives that is			2
' i was hit on as @entity5 more than @entity6 or @entity7 , and it definitely has to do with the amount of clothing she 's wearing , ' ms @entity10 writes			1
' there 's always the family that makes the grandpa or the dad get a picture alone , and they 'd whisper how pretty i was , or ask when i got off of work			0
' a less than magical moment : @entity10 , an @entity3 princess ( pictured as @entity6 ) has revealed that ' dads and grandpas ' hit on her more or less depending on how much clothing her character wore ms @entity10 is quick to add that she was never touched ' inappropriately ' and that nothing ' ridiculous ' ever happened with regards to creepy adults			1
the only other downsides of the job , she claims , involved wearing the uncomfortable @entity6 costume , which was ' death in the summer , ' and the occasional non-believers			2
she recalls one party of ten kids , all under the age of eight , who accosted her while she was playing @entity7 the fairy			1
' fly right now ! ' she remembers them squealing			2
' see , she ca n't ! she 's a liar ! liarrrr ! ' another little boy confronted her while she was playing @entity5 - one of the few @entity53 characters to actually have once existed - and informed her somewhat awkwardly that that he had once visited her grave			1
in character : ms @entity10 was once accused by a team of young kids of being a ' liar ' for claiming to be silvermist the fairy ( left ) but not being able to fly			1
pictured ( right ) as @entity5 ms @entity10 also discusses the rather complex set of steps required to make it as a @entity53 princess in the first place			1
first , contenders have to get through the auditions , then they are trained as ' character performers , ' which are non-speaking ' fur characters ' like @entity70 or @entity71			0
only then can employees be trained for a ' face role , ' which means they can interact verbally with visitors			0
ms @entity10 writes : ' day one is watching the movie , learning how to walk , talk and act ; and day two is meet and greets with guests			2
' she adds that training takes longer when special accents are required , such as for @entity82 characters like @entity83			0
she explains that employees are taught how to do their own make - up , which takes an hour or so every day , before being released to delight the children of @entity87 for roughly nine - hour shifts			0
adult fun : the lively entertainer ( pictured ) now works on a cruise ship , but speaks largely favorably about her former career at @entity87 in @entity93 so many autographs ! ms @entity10 recalls that there were times she would accidentally sign credit card receipts with ' @entity6 ' many children who were ' dropped ' into her lap were too shy to say much , ms @entity10 informs her captive internet audience			1
' in all honesty , i 've had thousands of conversations with people where i 'm the only one talking			0
i 'm proud of that , ' she remarks			0
of her former colleagues , ms @entity10 says they were mostly ' nice , ' sometimes ' nasty , ' and that the @entity53 princes were almost always gay			1
and the fun and games did n't always end when employees stepped behind the curtain and out of character			0
' one time in the break room , i saw @entity114 and @entity115 fit comfortably under @entity117 's dress , ' she writes			0
' when @entity119 came around the corner they popped out and scared her			0
' asked if it was sometimes difficult to leave her characters behind her , ms @entity10 recalled that indeed , there were times she would accidentally sign receipts with ' @entity6			1

@entity10 was once accused by kids of being a ' liar ' while playing @entity7 because she could n't fly
she sometimes accidentally signed credit card receipts with ' @entity6 '
almost all of the @entity53 princes were gay , she says
