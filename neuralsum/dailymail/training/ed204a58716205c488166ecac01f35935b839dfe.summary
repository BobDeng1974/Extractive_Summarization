by @entity0 last updated at 9:06 am on 13th february 2012 employees in @entity2 could soon be banned from wearing fragrances or scented products			1
state workers who interact with the public as part of their job will have to go to work au naturel if a proposed law is passed this week			1
@entity12 @entity11 has been proposed by @entity14 @entity13 to protect people with asthma or other allergies			1
kicking up a stink : public - facing employees in @entity2 could soon be banned from wearing fragrances or scented products exposure to perfume can trigger nasal congestion , a bout of sneezing and a runny nose			1
' it may seem silly , but it â€™s a health issue , ' mrs @entity13 told the @entity29			2
' many people have violent reactions to strong scents			2
' the bill will come into effect within 60 days if is approved by the @entity2 @entity12 on wednesday			1
it remains unclear how the proposed legislation would be enforced			1
the @entity37 and @entity38 , however , is recommending the @entity12 kill the bill as a possible constitutional conflict between rights of the individual employee and the health effects on an occasional customer with an allergy to scented products			0
up to one in 20 people suffer from a perfume allergy and it is a common cause of sinus problems , as well as other symptoms ranging from skin rashes and shortness of breath to nausea and dizziness			0
the chemical irritant in the scent penetrates the delicate tissue lining the sinuses and triggers swelling			0
it is quite rare , however , to be allergic to an entire perfume - usually it 's an individual component that causes the allergy			0
this can be quite hard to pin down , as fragrances are blends of different chemicals and sometimes also include natural ingredients			2
dr @entity71 , an environmental studies professor at the @entity72 , told @entity73 : ' people who have asthma , a large number of them are chemically sensitive , and therefore find fragrant products irritating			0
' most commercial perfume products , even air fresheners , have chemical make - ups and therefore are potential irritants			0

public workers in @entity2 will be unable to wear fragrances at work if proposed law is passed
