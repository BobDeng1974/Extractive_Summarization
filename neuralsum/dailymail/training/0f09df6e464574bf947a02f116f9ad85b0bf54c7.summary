using a card to withdraw money from a cash machine could soon be a thing of the past			1
@entity6 technology company @entity5 and @entity8 banking services provider @entity7 are in the process of installing their biometric ‘ @entity12 ’ technology across @entity8			1
the technology allows people to simply place their finger in a scanner instead of entering a card and pin number to withdraw cash			1
@entity5 and @entity7 have announced plans to install 1,730 atm machines in @entity8 with their biometric @entity12 technology ( pictured )			1
this allows people to simply scan their finger and then access their account , rather than using a standard card and pin the project , called @entity28 , will be implemented in a minimum of 1,730 atms in @entity8 this year			1
the technology has already been employed in a few banks in @entity8 , but now it is being rolled out to the general public			1
in a separate development , @entity34 has unveiled a new @entity37 interface to replace regular touch screens and keypads			0
it enables people to make choices and go through menus on a computer display by ' touching ' icons in the air			1
a 3d camera is used on the special glass to make the interactive display			0
it 's somewhat like the technology @entity52 's character uses in the film @entity54			1
@entity34 says it could be employed in future on atm machines and other devices			1
such depth - sensing cameras have been used to replace other technologies like the computer mouse			0
as of yet , however , @entity5 has announced no plans to bring the innovative technology to other countries like the @entity64			1
the technology works by using a combination of a ccd camera and near - infrared light			2
when a finger is placed in a scanner , the near - infrared light is passed through the finger			2
this is partially absorbed by haemoglobin in the veins and captures a finger vein pattern profile that is unique to everyone			2
this is then matched to a pre-registered profile to verify individual identity			0
using the system users can perform the same functions on an atm that they would with a regular card and pin number – withdraw cash , check balance , make payments and so on			1
‘ @entity12 is a key technology in our company ’s strategy , @entity89 , ceo at @entity90 , says in a statement			2
‘ we ’ve already been using this technology for atms in the cooperative banking sector			2
‘ once again , @entity90 is making a revolution in the market by launching the first biometric shared network in @entity102 which can be used by all banking customers			0
’ the technology works by sending near - infrared light through a person 's finger			1
this is partially absorbed by hemoglobin in the finger , which then creates a specific finger vein pattern unique to the person that can be matched to a pre-registered profile the announcement follows similar vein technology that is being employed elsewhere			1
in april , @entity118 shoppers signed up to make payments with a simple swipe of their hand			0
the developers hope hand scanning will become an alternative payment method if it is a success during trials in the city of @entity127 in southern @entity118			0
the vein - scanning terminals have been installed in 15 shops and restaurants after an engineering student at the local university came up with the technology two years ago while waiting in line to pay			2
handy idea ! developers hope hand scanning will become an alternative payment method for people if it is a success during trials in the city of @entity127 in southern @entity118 ( pictured ) some 1,600 signed up for the system which its inventor insists is safer than credit cards			2
' every individual 's vein pattern is completely unique , so there really is no way of committing fraud with this system , ' said researcher @entity149			0
' you always need your hand scanned for a payment to go through			0
' the plan is to patent the system and expand it around the globe			0
to sign up , users have to visit a shop or restaurant with a terminal , where they scan their palm three times and enter their social security and telephone numbers			0
a text message is then sent to their mobile phone with an activation link to a website , with payments taken directly from customer 's bank accounts twice a month			0
more than 1,000 shoppers have signed up to make payments with a swipe of their hand			0
every person 's vein pattern is unique , so there really is no way of committing fraud with this system , the maker claims			0

1,730 cash machines in @entity8 are to be given ' @entity184 ' technology
this lets people scan their finger and withdraw money from an @entity190
the technology does *n't* require the use of a card or pin number
it has already been used in several banks in @entity8 and @entity199
the ' @entity28 ' project is the work of @entity5 and @entity203
