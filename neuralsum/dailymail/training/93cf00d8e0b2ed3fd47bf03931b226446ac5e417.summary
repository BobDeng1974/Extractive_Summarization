@entity0 has written a book on the @entity2 in @entity3 in the 1980s investigative journalist @entity0 was warned to steer clear of the @entity2 by everyone involved in the unsolved case			1
however , her gut instinct told her to keep digging regardless of the potential dangers she would inevitably be confronted with on her search for the truth that is unveiled in her latest book			0
the @entity12 true crime writer refused to let fear stop her from embarking on a terrifying journey in an attempt to help solve the case involving four murders , five bombings and two shootings in @entity3 between 1980 - 1985			1
' for the sake of justice , it had to be written , ' she said			2
@entity23 gained the trust of all of the victim 's frightened families who finally agreed to break their wall of silence			0
but it was the chilling moment when @entity23 came face - to - face with the man named as a suspect , @entity32 , that she really felt she was placing her life on the line for the sake of justice			1
@entity37 was established in july 2013 to look into the case with investigations ongoing			0
detective superintendent @entity40 said the horrific crimes are embedded in the psyche of not only @entity43 but the entire country			0
' the review process is very much " behind the scenes " and involves looking at all existing materials , considering changes to technology , forensics and even the law , ' he said			0
' throughout the years , these crimes have been investigated by some of the best detectives this state has ever seen			0
' here @entity23 tells the gripping story of her dogged determination to unveil the truth of a 30 - year - old case : do n't prod that snake			1
that was the message given to me by people involved in the so - called @entity2 in @entity3 between 1980 and 1985 , an audacious series of bombings and shootings in which four people were killed and dozens more seriously wounded			1
but despite a suspect , @entity32 – who is still alive and living in @entity3 - being publicly named by the coroner in two inquests , incredibly , after more than three decades , the cases remain unsolved			1
@entity32 – who is still alive and living in @entity3 - was named by the coroner in two inquests into the @entity2 ranging from 1980 - 1985 @entity32 's wife at the time @entity77 ( left ) and their daughter @entity76 ( right ) @entity76 ( left ) on a shooting trip with her father @entity32 ( right ) circa mid - 1990s these were hits at the very heart of our judicial system and that they remain unsolved is staggering			1
two shooting murders in 1980 : the suspect 's brother - in - law , @entity90 and four months later , justice @entity91 , one week before he was due to hand down judgement in the suspect 's legal battle with his then wife , @entity77			1
there were no further murders for three years – and then all hell broke loose again			0
in 1984 , @entity100 's home was bombed , an explosion that miraculously , the family survived			2
@entity100 had taken over @entity91 ' court list			2
the following month , the @entity104 was bombed			0
the wife of @entity106 was killed instantly when a bomb exploded as she opened the front door of their home unit			1
@entity106 had taken over @entity100 's court list			1
the following year , there was an attempted murder of @entity77 's former solicitor , with a bomb placed in the wrong car , and five months later , a suburban @entity118 hall was bombed , in which one man was killed and scores more seriously wounded			1
@entity122 's brother - in - law @entity90 ( pictured right as a teenager with his father @entity124 ) was shot and killed in 1980 four months later , justice @entity91 ( pictured with his two children @entity126 and @entity127 ) was shot and killed , one week before he was due to hand down judgement in @entity122 's legal battle with wife @entity77 justice @entity106 's wife was killed when a bomb exploded as she opened their front door in 1984 while police scrambled in a deadly game of cat and mouse to catch the killer , who remained an elusive one step ahead , an emotionally beaten @entity77 relinquished custody of her precious daughter to her ex-husband			1
when i was researching the book , everyone involved in the case all gave me the same advice : do n't prod that snake			0
but as an investigative crime journalist and author of five true - crime books , ( including killing for pleasure on which the feature film , @entity155 , was based and @entity106 in @entity156 , which helped overturn @entity158 's double jeopardy laws ) how could i turn away from this story through fear ? for the sake of justice , it had to be written			1
the research was tough and heartbreaking			0
to my amazement , i found that not one person involved in these cases had been contacted by @entity43 police in more than three decades			0
@entity171 's families and the suspect 's former wife and daughter cowered behind a wall of silence			2
they had long ago given up hope that the murders and injuries of their loved ones would be solved and had vowed never to speak to journalists			0
it took time to gain their trust , but eventually they all agreed to tell their stories – including @entity77 and their daughter			2
justice @entity189 pictured with his late wife @entity190 and their children @entity90 and @entity193			1
it was a miracle they survived the bombing of their home in 1984 there is an incredible poignancy in holding the hands of victim 's families as they articulate their grief			2
more than three decades on , the heartache of these people – wives , children , husbands – remains palpable , as does their anger that no arrest has been made			0
why has n't it ? it is true enough that in the 1980s - despite circumstantial evidence against @entity122 - that police did not have that smoking gun			2
but i found further circumstantial evidence which , coupled with today 's new evidentiary regime , warrants - according to a senior criminal barrister - his immediate arrest			2
what we need to ask is : what are police doing ? alone , i attempted to interview the suspect at the house he shares on @entity3 's outskirts with his second wife			1
my mouth was parched as i walked up his long driveway – and as he walked silently , threateningly towards me , his hands plunged deep in his pockets			0
i panicked , for a moment			0
was he hiding a weapon ? his ice - cube eyes bored into mine as he told me , in no uncertain terms , to get off his property			0
i 've had some extremely frightening moments in my extensive true - crime career , writing about serial killers , paedophiles and psychopaths ; up close and personal more times than i can remember to the dark heart of the human soul			0
@entity248 ( pictured with his wife @entity249 ) was murdered when a @entity251 hall was bombed in 1984 but nothing has been as frightening as turning my back on this man and taking the long walk back down that driveway , alone			1
nothing as frightening as being warned by today 's investigating unsolved homicide team to ' watch my back ' when the book was released and being told that @entity122 is not under surveillance			1
nothing as frightening as being warned , repeatedly not to ' prod that snake ' and looking over my shoulder every time i left the house			0
was it worth the danger ? will the @entity267 and the @entity268 finally decide to test the evidence against @entity32 ? will the @entity104 murders finally be solved ? was it worth prodding that snake ? read the book			2
@entity0 ’s book @entity276 is out now through @entity158 , for $ 34.99 @entity23 refused to let fear stop her from embarking on a terrifying journey in an attempt to help solve the case involving four murders , five bombings and two shootings in @entity3 between 1980 - 1985			1
