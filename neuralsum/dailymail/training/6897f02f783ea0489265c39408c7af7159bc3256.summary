by @entity0 published : 07:14 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 08:52 est , 10 july 2013 @entity1 could one day turn car dashboards into giant touchscreens			0
according to a patent it has been granted , the ' @entity5 ' system would be fitted with laser pointers that track the driver 's eye movements as well as cameras that track head movements , and voice controls			1
it also has ' textured ' onscreen buttons - created by notches and grooves in a screen overlay - that have been designed to feel like real knobs and switches and can be used to control car temperature and wipers , for example			1
@entity1 's @entity5 patent is an extension of its @entity27 in the car feature of @entity29 , pictured			1
the feature was announced last month and is due to be released in 2014			0
it connects wirelessly to iphones and can be used to take calls on a hands - free kit , for example this image , taken from an @entity1 patent , is an early design for a ' @entity5 ' - a car dashboard fitted with a touchscreen			1
the patent has been granted by the @entity42 and the system is an extension of the @entity27 in the car plans announced with @entity1 's @entity29 talking satnavs and taking your eyes off the road to peer at a small screen could soon be a thing of the past after engineers have developed a portable device that beams directions onto the inside of a car windscreen			1
satellite navigation expert @entity58 has created a portable heads - up display ( @entity61 ) that sits on a car 's dashboard and projects turn - by - turn directions on a transparent film attached to the windscreen			2
the directions are sent to the @entity61 over @entity69 from a smartphone running the @entity71 or @entity73 satellite navigation apps			0
the @entity61 will go on sale in september and cost £ 139			0
these plans are in addition to the @entity27 in the car system announced as part of @entity29 , which is set to launch next year			1
the plans filed to the @entity42 credit @entity81 @entity80 as the inventor of the dash system			1
it contains a mix of original designs dating back to 1971 and more modern plans			0
the patent is called ' programmable tactile touch screen displays and man - machine interfaces for improved vehicle instrumentation and telematics ' , or ' @entity5 ' for short			1
according to the plans , the dashboard would have a heads - up display ( @entity61 ) fitted into the driver 's armrest to display maps , directions and so on			2
a touchscreen on the dashboard would respond to laser pointers that can track the driver 's eyes and switch layouts and screens accordingly , based on where the driver is looking			2
it would also have cameras that detect a driver 's head position so that onscreen information can be moved within the line of sight , for example			2
many of the other examples used in the patent involve images being projected onto the touchscreen , and because these images could be customised and changed , depending on what tools and features the driver wanted , the whole system could be programmable			2
under @entity1 's ' @entity5 ' plans , an in - car system is fitted with laser pointers that track the driver 's eye movements , cameras that track which direction their head is facing , as as well as voice controls			1
a heads - up display could be built into the driver 's armrest , too the touchscreen itself is shown as having ' raised ridges , indents or other tactile properties to facilitate operation without diverting attention away from the road			2
' this would mean that the driver could run their hand over a textured touchscreen and be able to work out where they need to press or slide without having to look down at the screen			0
elsewhere , transparent buttons designed to feel like real knobs , switchers and sliders could be added onto a screen overlay to make it easier for drivers to navigate the controls while driving			1
similarly lights behind the screen could illuminate the controls or switch off when the controls are not in use			0
textured buttons on the screen of the @entity5 could be used to control the car 's temperature , the wipers , the radio and so on			1
they would be added to a screen overlay to make them feel like real - life knobs , switches and sliders			1
the images on the left show early designs while the right - hand image shows a more modern look in the patent , @entity80 said : ' one problem is how to interact with the display , without having a keyboard - which is generally too cumbersome , switch filled , and space consuming for a car dash , armrest , or other interior location			2
' and a mouse is pretty much impossible as well			0
' i feel a key part of the answer lies in a form of tactile display or touchscreen with tactile properties not hereto fore seen			2
' this display could , depending on its construction , occupy some , or even most of the dashboard ( also called dash , or instrument panel )			0
' he continues that the @entity5 would create improve productivity because ' people in the @entity210 spend over 500 million hours it is said in their cars , and much of this time is wasted , from a business point of view			0
' @entity1 's @entity27 in the car will also display maps and directions on a touchscreen built into the car 's dashboard			0
@entity220 has announced it will make the system a standard feature in its new models set for release next year the patent is an extension of the @entity29 in the car features of @entity1 's new @entity29 software , announced last month			0
according to @entity1 : ' ios in the car seamlessly integrates your @entity27 device - and the @entity27 experience - with your in - dash system			1
' it is expected to launch in 2014 and drivers of vehicles fitted with the @entity27 in the car system will be able to connect their @entity239 and interact with the dashy using the car 's built - in display controls or @entity242			1
@entity220 has announced it will make the system a standard feature in its new models set for release next year			0
@entity1 adds that with @entity27 in the car : ' now you can easily and safely make phone calls , access your music , send and receive messages , get directions , and more			0
' it ’s all designed to let @entity239 focus on what you need , so you can focus on the road			0
