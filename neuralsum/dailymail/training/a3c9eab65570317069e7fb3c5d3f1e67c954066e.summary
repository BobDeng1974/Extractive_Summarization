by @entity0 five months is a long time in football and an eternity in the struggle for supremacy between @entity5 and @entity6			1
when @entity7 made his @entity9 debut in october @entity6 won 2 - 1 with a goal from @entity11 who had supposedly cost just £ 48.6m			1
@entity7 was hauled off after hour – having cost twice as much as his opposing number and yet looking like half the player			2
gone are the concerns about his injury problems and with them the doubts over his price tag			0
@entity11 ’s real value , in contrast , has everyone obsessed			2
an investigation into how much he really cost is now up around the £ 80m mark and as the price has risen , his worth to the team has declined			0
the more expensive he becomes the worse he looks ; and the more @entity7 looks like a bargain in comparison			2
@entity7 has found a home out on the right of @entity5 ’s now famed @entity58 front three alongside [ @entity61 ] @entity60 and @entity62 [ @entity62 ] and the combination has scored 52 goals between them with @entity7 getting on the scoresheet 14 times and providing 17 assists – more than any other @entity34 based player			1
reversal of fortune : @entity7 and @entity11 's careers in @entity71 have moved in opposite directions since @entity9 provider : @entity7 has notched up more assists - 17 - than any other player in the @entity71 league b : @entity7 b : @entity60 c : @entity62 the injuries have cleared up too			1
after a two - month period around the mid-winter break when his minutes - played ratio dropped below 50 per cent and it seemed he was being held together by blue kinesiology tape , he now looks far less worthy of the ‘ @entity86 ’ nickname he had been given by some , and has played all but 17 minutes of the last nine games there was a cruel irony that his room in the players ’ private hotel at @entity5 ’s @entity95 training complex where the team often stay overnight before or after big games was opposite the physio ’s room , but he is now taking big matches in his stride , even coming off the bench in midweek to replace @entity104 whose cruciate ligament had been torn ruling him out for the rest of the season			1
tale of the tape : how @entity7 and @entity11 's first seasons in @entity34 have compared the 21 - year - old @entity104 had come on in that first @entity9 scoring @entity5 ’s consolation goal and begging the question why spend 100m euros when you have such a home - grown talent coming through for free			1
shedding light on @entity7 ’s physical fragility his former @entity116 boss @entity115 told @entity119 this week : ' he had several serious injuries when he was a very young player			2
the first one ruled him out for 10 months and the second for nine			0
that is a long time to be out between the age of 18 and 20			0
the treatment he had was not always the best and that is why he needs to be 100 per cent and ca n’t be one of these players who can play through injury			0
' money matters : @entity11 signed for @entity6 for a supposed £ 48.6m , although that price is being questioned paying the price : the more @entity11 is reported to be worth , the worse his performances on the pitch have been brothers in arms : meanwhile , @entity7 has struck up a blossoming relationship with the world 's best , @entity62 the stress of not being physically right accompanied the doubts over that world record price - tag			1
he said on the day of his presentation that he would have signed for a penny			0
that certainly would have lowered expectations			0
he had not come cheaply and no - one has let him forget that during a first season in which during several games he has even been whistled by impatient supporters			0
@entity151 coach @entity150 is a former @entity5 player who knows all about the demands of the @entity153			2
he was jeered too despite being a home - grown talent and @entity71 international			2
' it ’s impossible for that price tag not to weigh heavy , ' he says			0
' the first person who will think ‘ i ’m probably not worth 100m ’ is the player himself			0
fighting fit : @entity7 has recovered from the injury problems that plagued the start of his career at the @entity153 weighing heavy : @entity151 coach @entity150 ( c ) has warned of the pressure on @entity7 from his enormous price tag ' it ’s not the player ’s fault , it ’s the market ’s fault			2
and the fact that he does n’t understand the @entity71 media will not save him because you can smell the doubts			0
i ’m certain that he will be aware of people questioning the price			0
the spotlight is on him and it is not just an external spotlight			0
at a big club like @entity5 the spotlight is also internal			0
' but the escalation of the @entity11 fee with the uncovering of more and more contracts that if interpreted to have been simulated wages will send the price rising further because of tax evasion penalties has changed @entity7 ’s status as @entity34 ’s most expensive player			1
and the idea that the @entity5 coach @entity192 has to pick @entity7 because he cost so much has been replaced by the notion that @entity194 at @entity6 is under boardroom pressure to select @entity11			1
frontrunners : @entity5 can open up a seven point lead over @entity6 is they win the clasico stick or twist ? criticism of @entity192 ( @entity200 ) and @entity202 's selection policies have changed ' no - one can say that @entity7 does n’t deserve to be in the team on his own merit because his numbers speak for themselves , ' says @entity150			1
@entity192 has admitted his team for sunday ’s game now picks itself with @entity7 very much in it			2
@entity6 coach @entity194 , meanwhile , knows supporters want him to leave @entity11 where he was last weekend when @entity6 won 7 - 0 – on the bench			1
the forward line of @entity212 , @entity213 and @entity214 has actually only scored one goal fewer than @entity5 ’s famed @entity58 and @entity6 followers want those three to start this weekend			1
whoever accompanies @entity214 , sunday will still be about him and @entity62 first and foremost			1
the idea that @entity62 is now ‘ streets ahead of any other player in the world ’ as heard by some commentators in midweek forgets that @entity214 has scored 17 goals in his last 17 games			1
the weekend ’s duel will throw up the usual race to break more and more ridiculous records			0
record breaker ? @entity62 is one goal away from break @entity230 ' all - time scoring record for @entity5 @entity233 : @entity214 is getting back to his best after a season disrupted by injury @entity62 needs another goal to beat @entity230 ’ 240 goals scored for @entity5 and @entity214 is one goal short of @entity241 ’s 18 goals scored in the @entity9 fixture record			1
the @entity243 is also one goal from @entity245 in the all - time league scorers list – passing him would leave only @entity247 to aim for			0
the two of them will fight it out for top of the bill but there is a fascinating undercard			0
@entity7 lost out to @entity11 last october but now he has his rematch and after an incredible turn around in their first seasons in @entity71 he is favourite to come out on top on sunday and to win his first @entity34 title at the end of the season .			1

@entity5 are four points ahead of @entity6 ahead of @entity9
@entity7 was taken off in his first clasico while @entity11 scored
@entity7 is now winning *plaudits* in @entity71 while @entity6 rival @entity11 is faltering
@entity7 has scored 14 goals and made 17 assists - more than any other player
*confusion* over the actual cost of @entity11 's transfer has *distracted* him
@entity62 and @entity214 will be *competing* to break more records on sunday
