the chairman of the @entity2 panel responsible for green - lighting war spending warned the @entity5 administration thursday that ruling out ' boots on the ground ' in the battle against @entity9 if it formally asks @entity10 to authorize future military operations			1
' i will not support sending our military into harm ’s way with their arms tied behind their backs , ' said @entity20 chairman @entity19 , a @entity22 @entity21 who is in the last weeks before his retirement			1
he warned during a committee hearing that regardless of who holds his gavel when a formal @entity29 comes to @entity30 from the @entity2 , ' should the @entity26 proposed by the president contain such limitations it will be doa in @entity10			0
' @entity34 chairman gen. @entity33 said in the same hearing that @entity37 military forces are making progress restoring order in the @entity41 city of @entity42 and re-establishing the country 's border with @entity45			1
as those operations gain traction , he said , the ' boots on the ground ' question could be re-opened			0
' i 'm not predicting at this point that i would recommend that those forces in @entity42 and along the border would need to be accompanied by @entity56 forces , but we 're certainly considering it , ' @entity33 told lawmakers			1
@entity19 , chairman of the @entity20 , issued a pointed warning that @entity10 would refuse to sign a permission slip for war unless the option of using ground troops were left on the table ' i do n't know specifically what they are going to propose ' : defense secretary @entity69 said he ; s out of the loop on a new @entity26 from the @entity2 ' we 're certainly considering it ' : @entity34 chairman gen. @entity33 told lawmakers he was open to the idea of recommending @entity56 ground troops to @entity5 as it conducts a long - term military operation to ' degrade and ultimately destroy ' the self - declared @entity80 ( @entity9 ) , the @entity5 administration has been relying on an @entity26 hastily passed in the weeks following @entity82 's september 11 , 2001 terror attacks on @entity83 and the @entity84 – and on an iraq war resolution passed in 2003			1
now , however , the enemy is @entity9 , a @entity88 caliphate that has rampaged across two - thirds of @entity45 and @entity37			1
its members were expelled from @entity82 and the older terror group regards @entity9 fighters as apostates			2
the result has been a @entity2 that is relying on a battlefield permission - slip that many in @entity10 say is ill - fitting and obsolete			2
the administration has asked for $ 5.6 billion in new defense spending authority , raising eyebrows and new questions on the @entity102 as @entity5 pledged to double the @entity56 military presence in the @entity9 war while simultaneously claiming there would be no @entity56 battle engagement			1
@entity19 warned gen. @entity33 that ' limiting our advisers to headquarters buildings will not help newly trained @entity37 and @entity45 opposition forces hold terrain , much less defeat [ @entity9 ] in the field			1
' ' yet the president has doubled down on his policy of ' no boots on the ground , ' despite any advice you give him			0
' @entity122 @entity121 rep. @entity121 told defense secretary @entity69 that vague commitments from the @entity2 has made it impossible for @entity10 to do its job			0
' until you get words on paper it 's kinda hard to make progress , ' @entity121 said			0
@entity131 was noncommittal and said the @entity2 was internally debating whether it needs a new aumf from lawmakers – and how a request should be worded			0
' i do n't know specifically what they are going to propose , ' he said			0
' i do n't know specifically if they are going to send it up as a legislative proposal			0
' ' i know the president has had specific conversations with specific members of both the @entity2 and @entity145 on this			0
' @entity145 @entity147 have found their voices since their @entity150 drubbing , and have spent much of the last week demanding a vote on a new @entity26 before @entity21 take over committee chairmanships and swear in a new majority in january			2
on wednesday at the @entity156 in @entity157 , @entity155 @entity147 sen. @entity154 complained that the @entity56 has been ' engaged in a war – that is not about imminent defense of the @entity56 – without legal authority			2
' in a statement after the election , @entity154 said he was ' troubled by suggestions ... that @entity10 should wait until the new @entity10 session in 2015 to take this vote			0
' ' we have already asked too many @entity56 service members to risk their lives without a political consensus behind this mission , ' he said			2
anti-war protests only on days ending in ' y ' : the @entity174 group sent an activist to disrupt thursday 's proceedings the enemy : an @entity9 fighter gestures from a vehicle in the countryside of the @entity45 @entity182 town of @entity183 after the terror army took control of the area last month @entity187 : while @entity56 armed forces are n't carrying weapons into battle , the @entity189 forces have been holding @entity9 at bay republicans like @entity196 rep. @entity195 insist that @entity198 airstrikes are illegal without a congressional go - ahead			1
' this is nothing more than an abdication of our constitutional responsibility , ' he said thursday			0
but moments later he hinted that many @entity21 would play a dovish role unless the @entity5 administration clearly defined victory while asking for billions of dollars to achieve it			1
' for goodness sakes , why in the world should be make such a commitment , and we do n't even have an endpoint for it ? ' ' what is the end - state of what we are trying to accomplish ? ' he asked			0
' i do n't know how we convince the @entity56 people that a nation which is financially broke ... where is it coming from ? please explain to the @entity10 and the @entity56 people how it ends one day ? ' @entity131 insisted that @entity9 ' continues to represent a serious threat to @entity56 interests , our allies , and the @entity227 ... and wields influence over a broad swath of territory in western and northern @entity37 and eastern @entity45			1

@entity5 wants $ 5.6 billion to fight @entity9 in @entity37 and @entity45 but @entity21 *bristle* at insistence that @entity56 troops wo n't engage in combat
now the military joint chiefs chairman says the @entity84 ' is certainly considering ' recommending sending @entity56 personnel into harm 's way
administration has been relying on congressional military authorization that dates back to 2003
members on both right and left insist that @entity5 ca n't constitutionally continue to wage war without new permission from lawmakers
' i will not support sending our military into harm ’s way with their arms tied behind their backs , ' said the @entity20 chairman
