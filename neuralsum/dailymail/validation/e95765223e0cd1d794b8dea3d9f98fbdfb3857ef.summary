repeated use of some types of antibiotic may raise the risk of developing type 2 diabetes , warn researchers			1
findings from a new @entity8 study underline the need to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions , it is claimed			1
more than 3 million @entity11 are diagnosed with diabetes and nine out of ten have type 2 which occurs when the body gradually loses the ability to process blood sugar			1
researchers looked at the number of antibiotic prescriptions given to 200,000 diabetics a year before they were diagnosed , and found those given at least two courses had a higher chance of getting the condition type 2 is strongly linked to lifestyle factors such as being overweight or obese , leading a sedentary lifestyle and eating an unhealthy diet			1
researchers from the @entity31 at the @entity32 carried out the investigation			0
they looked at the number of antibiotic prescriptions given to more than 200,000 diabetics in the @entity11 at least one year before they were diagnosed with the disease , and compared this to the number given to 800,000 non-diabetic patients of the same age and sex			1
they found that patients prescribed at least two courses of penicillins , cephalosporines , quinolones and macrolides were at higher risk of being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes			1
the risk increased with the number of antibiotic courses prescribed , says a report in the @entity55 ( must credit )			2
more than 3million @entity11 have diabetes and nine out of ten have type 2 which occurs when the body loses the ability to process blood sugar patients prescribed 2 - 5 courses of penicillins – used for a variety of infections - increased their risk of diabetes by 8 per cent			1
the risk increased by 23 per cent for those having more than five courses of penicillins			2
patients having 2 - 5 courses of quinolones , used in respiratory and urinary tract infections , had an increased diabetes risk of 15 per cent , which rose 37 per cent for those having more than five courses			2
the risk was calculated after adjusting for other risk factors such as obesity , smoking history , heart disease and history of infections			0
study leader dr @entity86 said ‘ gut bacteria have been suggested to influence the mechanisms behind obesity , insulin resistance and diabetes in both animal and human models			0
‘ previous studies have shown that antibiotics can alter the digestive ecosystem			0
’ senior author @entity98 - @entity97 added : ‘ while our study does not show cause and effect , we think changing levels and diversity of gut bacteria could explain the link between antibiotics and diabetes risk			0
’ there was no increase in risk associated with use of antivirals or anti-fungal medications and the study found little evidence of a link between antibiotic use and the risk of type 1 diabetes			2
dr @entity86 said ‘ over-prescription of antibiotics is already a problem around the world as bacteria become increasingly resistant to their effects			0
‘ our findings are important , not only for understanding how diabetes may develop , but as a warning to reduce unnecessary antibiotic treatments that might do more harm than good			2
’ prof @entity133 , professor of @entity134 , @entity135 , said ‘ patients with type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of developing infections , and therefore they are more likely to be prescribed antibiotics to treat those infections			0
‘ in the year prior to diabetes diagnosis , patients may show some signs of disease and may also have a higher risk of infection , and therefore receive more antibiotics			0
‘ this is a very large and helpful study linking diabetes with antibiotic consumption in the @entity11 public , but at this stage we do n’t know which is the chicken and which is the egg			1
‘ the idea that antibiotics might contribute to diabetes development might be important and more research needs to be done			0

researchers probed antibiotic prescriptions to 200,000 diabetes *sufferers*
found those given two or more courses were more likely to be diabetic
three million @entity11 are diabetic , and *95* per cent suffer from @entity168
