it is hardly a secret weapon to strike fear into the heart of his opponent across the net			0
but this was the list of ten motivational tips that @entity9 hoped would inspire him to victory			1
some , including ‘ try your best ’ which was second on the list , seemed to be a statement of the obvious for any sportsman , let alone a tennis player ranked no 4 in the world who has looked back to his best in recent weeks			1
match points : the motivational hints for tennis star @entity9 , scrawled on the back of a letter from fans likewise the exhortation to ‘ focus on each point ’			1
other tips were more straightforward , such as ‘ try to keep him at the baseline , make him move ’ and ‘ stay low on passes , use your legs ’			1
but the list also included such seemingly baffling instructions as ‘ be intense with your legs ’ , ‘ be good to yourself ’ – the no 1 instruction – and ‘ be proactive during points ’			1
and it is to be hoped that @entity9 wo n’t be including the sixth on the list , ‘ try to be the one dictating ’ , in his plans for when he marries girlfriend @entity43 in april			2
@entity9 was photographed consulting the ten tips , which had been scrawled on the back of a letter of support from his fans , during his quarter - final at a tournament in the @entity51 last week			1
in need of a lift : @entity9 consults the note during his quarter - final at a tournament in the @entity51 last week unfortunately , they do not seem to have been much help for the @entity59 no 1 , who was beaten in straight sets by lower - ranked @entity63 player @entity62			1
@entity9 , pictured at @entity64 last year , revealed that he has been working with a sports psychologist the photograph of the instructions was taken by @entity51 journalist @entity68 , who obtained the note after the match			1
the scribblings provide an insight into the famously grumpy @entity74 ’s mind and suggest he does try to think positively on court			0
it is unclear who was responsible for the instructions , as his coach @entity79 did not accompany him to the @entity80 in @entity81			0
however , @entity9 revealed last month that he has been working with a sports psychologist , and the messages are all certainly positive and motivational			2
he has used sports psychologists in the past , although without too much conviction			0
‘ i do n’t think counting to ten helps when you are playing in the semi-finals of a @entity88 on @entity89 at @entity64 against one of the best athletes in the world , ’ he once said , scathingly			2
on another occasion he suggested that a sports psychologist ‘ does n’t know what it feels like or the best way to deal with things because they have n’t been there ’			0
but now he appears to believe they can have an important part to play in his career			0
he revealed last month : ‘ i think when it comes to psychology it has to be something that the player wants and the player buys into			2
‘ when it ’s someone else ’s suggestion , in the past i have n’t felt like it ’s worked			0
but just now i think it ’s working well			0
’ @entity9 , who lost to @entity114 in the final of the @entity116 a fortnight ago , was pictured looking at the notes in his courtside chair during the match as he lost 6 - 4 6 - 2 to @entity62 – the first time he has been beaten by the @entity63 in 13 meetings			1
couple : it is to be hoped that @entity9 wo n’t be including the sixth on the list , ' try to be the one dictating ' , in his plans for when he marries girlfriend @entity43 in april the paper his instructions were written on – a letter from a group of his most ardent fans – also suggests the famously dour sportsman has a sensitive side			1
the letter read : ‘ there are good days and bad days in tennis and we know how it feels when something going wrong way [ sic ] , but you must stay strong , never give up and always believe in your dreams			2
’ it was signed @ magicmurray fans			0
it also urged him to ‘ avoid haters ’ , saying they were ‘ always proud of you ’ and added : ‘ we all believe that you will be number 1 soon … you will be our number 1 , always ! ’			0
