by @entity0 published : 19:05 est , 23 february 2014 @entity2 : 03:24 est , 24 february 2014 we saw a passing master class from @entity5 in midweek for @entity6 , but @entity7 had one of his own on saturday			1
he completed 135 passes against @entity11 , the most by any player this season			1
and , as his touch map shows , he dictated play from all over the pitch			2
all - action : @entity7 completed 135 passes against @entity11 , the most by any player this season spot the difference : @entity7 's touch map ( right ) looks like that of @entity6 's @entity5 against @entity22 masterclass : @entity5 is mobbed by @entity24 ( left ) and @entity25 after scoring against @entity22 jan 23 , 2013 @entity26 27 22 2 3 685 @entity22 27 13 8 6 47 jan 23 , 2014 @entity27 27 18 6 3 602 @entity22 27 18 5 4 59 @entity22 had a tough time against @entity6 last week			1
they put in a great shift with 10 men but would have been disappointed to concede that late second goal			2
their performance against @entity33 was the perfect response			1
they played with confidence and scored some excellent goals , particularly @entity38			1
@entity22 are only a point behind @entity40 and that shows how far they have come in the space of a year			1
at this stage last season they were fifth , 21 points off the leaders			1
and do n’t forget it was an away win in @entity48 that sent them on that fine run at the end of last season			1
@entity53 for it : @entity38 ( right ) celebrates scoring with @entity55 ( centre ) and @entity57 kick - start : @entity55 celebrates in @entity48 last season , setting the ball rolling for @entity22 's fine end of the season @entity63 against @entity40 in the @entity64 this week is a mouth - watering prospect and you can be sure that @entity68 will be playing more mind games than ever			1
@entity68 will try to soften up his former striker , calling him the best there ’s ever been and saying he wishes he was still at the club			1
he ’ll be doing that to try to take the intensity out of @entity63 , to tame the animal inside him and make him feel like he does n’t want to score against his old manager and club			1
you can be sure that if the tie is close going into the second leg , @entity68 will wait around in the tunnel at @entity82 and give him a little cuddle to try to soften him up			1
new colours : @entity63 , now at @entity86 , is readying himself to face the club where he became a legend brothers in arms : and @entity68 has been singing @entity63 's praises ahead of @entity40 v @entity86 @entity93 's transformation has been incredible and the player deserves all the credit			1
@entity96 did n’t seem to think he was ready for a starring role when he took over from @entity98 and often left him on the bench at the start of last season			2
but @entity93 has turned it around			1
i ’m told he ’s one of the best trainers at the club and his attitude has helped him come through those tough times			2
after another two goals at @entity109 , he deserves all the praise he gets			2
very few people saw this coming			2
@entity98 got a lot of criticism for spending £ 16m on @entity93 but it looks like money well spent now			1
flying high : @entity93 capped his fantastic season so far with a two - goal display against @entity119 in action : @entity93 plays a pass under pressure from @entity123 in the 4 - 3 thriller former @entity126 sporting director @entity125 said last week that @entity127 was under pressure at @entity126 with the emergence of @entity131 starlet @entity130			1
he did n’t look that bothered as he fired home this brilliant goal on saturday night			0
that was the best way to silence his doubters			0
have some of that , @entity125			0
settling in : @entity127 flies down the wing against @entity139 , with @entity140 failing to keep up watch out for @entity141			0
he could be coming to a @entity143 ground near you			1
i ’m a big fan of @entity146 and the way they play and , in the 22 - year - old defender , they have a real star on their hands			2
he ’s technically very good on the ball , is a brilliant defender and has a great stature about him			0
at £ 2.6m , he was a real bargain and a lot of top teams will be looking at him			0
@entity159 are looking for a @entity161 replacement and @entity162 need a regular partner for @entity164			0
@entity165 would fit the bill for either team			0
going to @entity146 was a clever move for him because it ’s a great club to prove your qualities — just ask @entity172			0
@entity146 will know there will be plenty of suitors in the summer			0
if he does leave , though , it will certainly be for a lot more than £ 2.6m			0
blonde ambition : @entity146 's @entity141 , with girlfriend @entity179 , could step up to the @entity143 there was a lot of big business done in the transfer window but one of the deals that went a bit under the radar was @entity188 moving on loan to @entity190			1
it was a great deal , particular when you look at the big money spent elsewhere on players			0
@entity188 was fantastic at @entity195 and he already looks like he ’s striking up a good relationship with @entity197			0
shoring it up : @entity188 's loan deal to @entity190 could prove crucial for the @entity190 when he moved to @entity200 he became a bit of a forgotten man but he ’s a top player with plenty of @entity143 experience			1
he has helped keep clean sheets against @entity162 and @entity206 now and it ’s those kind of performances and results that could be the difference between @entity190 staying up or going down			0
@entity211 has been under huge pressure recently , especially when the club released a list of his potential replacements			0
let ’s hope results like this stop them going to press again			0
after saturday ’s loss , @entity219 might be thinking : ‘ what have i done here ? ’ @entity223 have already had three managers in three months and , with @entity225 as chairman , you ca n’t rule out the same happening at @entity227			0
losing 4 - 0 to @entity228 is not a result that should be happening if you want to survive in the @entity143			1
teetering : @entity219 could only wince and watch his @entity227 side lose 4 - 0 at home to @entity228 that ’s no disrespect to @entity228			2
they were magnificent , particularly @entity235 and @entity236 , who already have a great understanding			0
but @entity227 are in trouble			0
it ’s in @entity219 ’s nature to be attacking , but he went a bit far with his line - up			2
with three wide men in a very attacking midfield they left themselves open			0
you need to shore things up at the back before you can start going at teams in this league because , when you ’re at the bottom , organisation is the priority , goals come second			0
dejected : @entity227 's players hang their heads after conceding a third goal to @entity228 at home			2

@entity7 completed a @entity143 - high 135 passes against @entity11
his performance was *reminiscent* of @entity5 ' display at the @entity265
@entity22 have come so far since last season 's win over @entity6
@entity93 continued his excellent season against @entity119
@entity68 is buttering up @entity63 with compliments
