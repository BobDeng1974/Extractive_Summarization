he said : ‘ we could and should have done better			0
’ addressing voters ’ doubts about mr @entity2 , mr @entity25 said he was a strong leader , but added : ‘ i know people say he ’s got panda eyes and strange lips – i could make the same remarks in different ways about mr @entity125 or mr @entity126			1

even in politics a conversation is n’t simply waiting for your turn to speak – it has to be about engagement			0

amongst @entity19 voters there is a huge frustration			2

' there ’s a bigger issue : is @entity19 in touch with its core vote and with those people who voted @entity19 in 1997 but have abstained since ? ' because that ’s a lot of the people who … have shifted to @entity14 – those lost five million voters from 1997			2

wherever you go you hear , “ it ’s your leader ”			0
