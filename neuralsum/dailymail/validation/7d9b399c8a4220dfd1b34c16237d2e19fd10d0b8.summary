@entity1 user @entity0 posted a picture of this @entity4 mannequin to @entity1 and pointed out that it looked dangerously thin fashion store @entity4 has come under fire for featuring a mannequin in their shop that appeared to be seriously underweight			1
@entity0 , from @entity9 , tweeted a picture of one of the plastic models which featured ribs clearly protruding from the chest			1
she wrote : ' @entity4 , why 've you chosen to make collar bones & ribs so central to the marketing of this dress ? dangerous ! ' the medic 's picture was quickly picked up by outraged women on the social media site , who called for the mannequin to be removed from the stores			1
one user called @ @entity27 wrote : ' ewwww ! i buy @entity4 quite often , but i do not want to look like this ! what on earth is this about ? ' another called ‏ @ @entity34 said : shame on @ @entity35 for this normalising of the super-skinny			1
what a terrible message to send to our young women			2
' women were n't the only ones disgusted by the mannequin 's skinny frame though - men also voiced their distaste			1

someone has made conscious decision to do that			2
' a spokesperson for the @entity55 eating disorder charity beat said : ' it ’s very concerning that well respected and influential high street fashion retailers persist in using obviously underweight mannequins			2
' unhelpful in fuelling the continuous exposure of thinness as the ‘ ideal ’ , retailers should consider very seriously the messages that they put across and we should all play a part in giving a generation of young people confidence in their bodies , their appearance and their sense of wellbeing			2
' the spokesperson continued : ' people who are at risk , or already affected by an eating disorder can be triggered or maintained in the disorder by the images they see everywhere			2
' the constant portrayal of a very slender look as the only aspirational ideal for young people needs to be challenged if a generation are to grow up with a robust sense of their self worth			2
' @entity0 posted the picture of the mannequin on @entity1 along with a photo of the dress on the runway @entity1 users were quick to voice their disgust at the pictures @entity4 has responded to the criticism on the social media site , with a spokesperson saying : ' as a brand we celebrate a range of body sizes within collections and offer size 6 through to 16			1
' both the mannequin and model you have seen representing @entity4 are size 10 which is industry standard			1
' no offence was meant and the intention is not to advertise a negative body image but to focus on the style of the garment in both instances			2
' we are so sorry for any disappointment and upset this may have caused			2
' the model who wore the dress on the catwalk also had a very slender frame the furore comes just a few weeks after the high street store @entity122 were criticised for featuring a super skinny mannequin in one of their stores			1
with a protruding chest bone and super skinny arms , this is the incredibly slim mannequin being used by high street store @entity122			1
the shocking picture was taken by a passer - by of a window display of the brand 's @entity134 store in @entity136			1
it shows the thin - looking mannequin wearing a floaty white top			1
in response to the photograph below , which was taken in february , eating disorder charities have called for shops to take more responsibility for setting standards			2
snapped : this is the shocking photo of a mannequin that was spotted in the @entity148 in @entity149 , @entity136 @entity150 from @entity151 , the @entity55 's leading charity supporting those with eating disorders , said : ' it is disappointing to see such an obviously underweight mannequin in the high street			1
' this stereotype can be extremely harmful to some and while the fashion industry does n't directly cause eating disorders - it has a powerful influence that is highly toxic to some vulnerable young people			2
' we call on retailers to recognise the responsibility they have to use this influence in positive , life enhancing ways			2
fashion can be fantastic - creative , aspirational and fun			0
' what we need is a mixture of different heights and widths of mannequins in our shops to reflect the reality of people 's different shapes and sizes , heights , widths and build			0
' @entity181 , who took the photograph of the mannequin after spotting it in @entity186 brand of @entity122 , said she found it ' revolting '			1
the 32 - year - old said : ' there has been so much uproar with the fashion industry not representing ' real ' women i thought idiocies like this had been abolished			0
' i 'm a size eight and this made me feel fat which is just not acceptable			0
' controversy : @entity122 has come under fire from eating disorder charities for using super slim mannequins @entity203 , the secretary and co-founder of @entity205 , told @entity206 : ' without doubt the mannequin is not a realistic reflection of a body size and shape			1
' it is outrageous to portray this as acceptable – people may aspire to this body shape whilst people with an eating disorder , may in fact consider themselves not thin enough			1
' i really do think the retailers have a duty of care to its shoppers to be more realistic in the size of the model or mannequins that they use to showcase their goods			0
' @entity203 went on to say : ' often people who are low in self - esteem have a false belief that by managing body weight and shape they will be happier , in truth they may plummet to dangerously low levels in weight that may cause them to be medically at risk			0
' people need to be comfortable in the skin they are in – and celebrate the difference in body weight and shape			0
she added : ' promoting clothing in this way can be highly dangerous to potential sufferers of anorexia nervosa			1
' an eating disorder has the highest mortality rate of any other mental health illness with a staggering 20 per cent of people dying each year from their illness or through suicide			0
' manufacturers and retailers need to take more responsibility for their actions and consider the consequences of how this may impact on people suffering from an eating disorders			0
' @entity261 , a part time plus model said : ' i do not think the fuller figure has made its way to high fashion yet which is sad as fuller figured women can be just as stylish as slimmer women			0
' the high street usually means clothes everyone can wear so it ’s disappointing to see this mannequin used by @entity122			1
' skinny shaming is now as bad as fat shaming and as talked about but @entity122 are failing to show a healthy figure			0
' @entity278 also contacted whistles for comment			0
in october student @entity281 posted this image of her friend standing next to a @entity285 mannequin with stick thin legs more women with normal sized legs posed next to the @entity285 mannequin			1
the store said it was not meant to represent a real woman in october , @entity285 was slammed for using using mannequins with stick thin legs with student @entity281 sharing a picture of her friend posing comparing her legs to those on the model			1
the image was shared more than 7,000 times			0
a @entity285 spokesman said the mannequin was ‘ based ’ on a size 10			1
‘ the form is a stylised one to have more impact in store and create a visual focus , ’ said the spokesman			0
‘ mannequins are made from fibreglass , so [ they ] need to be of certain dimensions to allow clothing to be put on and removed			0
this is therefore not meant to be a representation of the average female body			0
’ over the last decade , campaigners have been fighting back against a series of fashion and online trends they say encourage eating disorders			0
a row over so - called ' size zero ' models was sparked in 2000 when the @entity322 linked an obsession with ' abnormally thin ' models on tv and in magazines with the rise in conditions such as anorexia and bulimia			1
@entity331 banned models with a body mass index below 18.5 from its catwalks in 2006 in what was seen as a victory for campaigners against size zero			0
but later that year , @entity341 model @entity339 was found dead from a heart attack linked to malnutrition and six months later her sister , model @entity344 , 18 , died in similar circumstances			0
their deaths were used to highlight the pressure on models to meet a demand for unnaturally thin young women			2
campaigners have hit out over the use of ' size zero ' models on catwalks and have linked the desire among women to emulate the so - called ' thigh gaps ' of models like @entity362 ( right ) to eating disorders last year , internet craze ' thinspiration ' - where people post photographs of their emaciated bodies on social media to ' inspire ' weight loss - was also blamed for encouraging eating disorders			1
@entity372 , from charity beat , said : ' those pictures are very unlikely to be real			0
' they are digitally manipulated to make the bodies shown appear extremely emaciated			0
altered pictures of famous people are often included too			0
' a further craze by girls to emulate model 's ' thigh gaps ' erupted earlier this year when experts warned it was further fuelling the issue			0
@entity386 , head of a facility which deals with sufferers in @entity389 , @entity385 said : ' the intrusion and presence of social media in our lives really does make it very difficult			1
' the important distinction about thigh gap is it gives you an actual visual to achieve , this visual comparison of how your body does or does n't stack up			0
