lurking off the coast of @entity1 are swarms of stunning jellyfish - from the common moon to the rare purple striped stinger and the tiny @entity6			1
and divers @entity7 and @entity9 have captured these floating beauties in exquisite detail			1
the images include a number of bright and colourful jellyfish that are rarely spotted so close to the @entity15 , as well as so - called sea squirts which have been seen in abundance in recent years			1
the colourful mauve stingers ( pictured ) have tentacles that can grow around 13ft - long ( four metre ) and these eight tentacles are dangerous for unprotected @entity22 species is also known as @entity23 which means ' open ocean night light ' in @entity25 the images are from a collection called @entity28 and were captured off the coast of @entity1 around the outlying islands of @entity31 and @entity32 , some 85 miles ( 136km ) west of @entity33 , as well as in @entity34			1
the divers said the further they headed offshore , the more bizarre and rare these lifeforms became and mr @entity7 , 36 from @entity37 , said a particular highlight was the mauve stinger			1
also known as the purple striped stinger , this species is native to warmer waters around the @entity43 , @entity44 and deeper waters of the @entity46			2
another shot captures the lion 's mane jellyfish ( pictured )			1
they can vary in colour depending on their size - larger jellies are typically bright red to dark purple while smaller ones are lighter yellows and oranges , like a lion 's mane , which gives the species its name			1
they are typically found in the waters of the @entity64 , @entity46 and @entity65 the images were taken by divers @entity7 and @entity9 off the coast of @entity1 around the outlying islands of @entity31 and @entity32 , some 85 miles ( 136km ) west of @entity33 , and in @entity34			1
mr @entity7 , 36 from @entity37 , said a highlight was the mauve stinger , also known as the purple striped stinger ( pictured )			2
it is native to warmer waters around @entity44 and is a rare visitor to the @entity15 the images are from a collection called @entity28			0
the divers captured various species of jellyfish including so - called mild stingers that grow around 4 inches ( 10cm ) in diameter			1
these stingers have multiple radial canals that connect the centre to the edge of the flat bell also known as the purple striped stinger , this species is native to warmer waters around the @entity43 , @entity44 and deeper waters of the @entity46			2
it is a rare visitor to the @entity15 but has been known to travel to the western coast of the @entity90 and many experts believe the movement is linked to global warming			0
the jellies have tentacles that can grow around 13ft - long ( four metre ) and are dangerous for unprotected divers			2
the species is also known as @entity23 which means ' open ocean night light ' in @entity25			2

mr @entity7 said : ' despite all the dive gear , you still have to be careful not to get a stinging tentacle in the face so you do approach them with care			2
' some tentacles can be several metres long and could sting you before you see the jellyfish			0
' so we always took care to look around carefully and point them out to each other			0
' it was interesting to see young fish taking shelter in the tentacles of the lion 's mane and mauve stinger jellies which they use to stay safe from predators			1
' another shot captures the lion 's mane jellyfish in green , shallower water			1
they can vary in colour depending on their size - larger jellies are typically bright red to dark purple while smaller ones are lighter yellows and oranges , like a lion 's mane , which gives the species its name			1
like other jellies , the lion 's mane jellyfish reproduces asexually until it reaches full maturity at which point it reproduces sexually			1
the largest of these jellies have been recorded up to 120ft long ( 36.5 metres ) and with more than 800 tentacles divided into eight groups			0
while the smallest of the species measure just half an inch ( 1.3 cm ) in diameter and are 8 ft long ( 2.4 metres )			0
while diving in @entity34 mr @entity7 spotted a swarm of harmless moon jellyfish ( shown )			1
moon jellyfish are also known as @entity163 and grow up to 40cm ( 15.7 inches ) in diameter			1
they are recognisable by their patterns of spots and streaks and swim horizontally , keeping the bell near the surface at all times			0
this allows the tentacles to be spread over the largest possible area , in order to better catch food the left - hand image shows a close - up of a species known as @entity6			2
they grow around 1.5 inches long ( 4cm ) and can have up to 90 tentacles			0
there are more than 350 different types of jellyfish and some 2,000 variations within these species			2
despite their reputation , many are harmless			0
the right - hand image was captured around 85 miles ( 136km ) west of @entity33 this image shows mr @entity7 capturing the previous close - up image of @entity6			1
the tiny swimmers typically first appear in the @entity193 , off the @entity195 coast and around @entity196 and @entity197 in may			0
they can still be spotted as late as september they are typically found in the waters of the @entity64 , @entity46 and @entity65			0
while diving in @entity34 , mr @entity7 spotted a swarm of harmless moon jellyfish			1
moon jellyfish are also known as @entity163 or saucer jellies and grow up to 40cm ( 15.7 inches ) in diameter			1
they are recognisable by their patterns of spots and streaks and swim horizontally , keeping the bell near the surface at all times			0
this allows the tentacles to spread over the largest possible area and increase the chances of catching prey			0
this image shows a mauve stinger in the foreground as a seal swims in the background			0
mr @entity7 said that distance of the outlying islands from the mainland ' and their exposure to @entity46 storms and swell makes their wildlife both spectacular but also hard to reach			2
if the weather gods are on your side and the opportunity exists , these sites will have any diver in awe of the beauty within our seas ' mr @entity7 said : ' the million moon jellies in @entity34 were incredible and we returned the following day to photograph them and swim amongst them			1
as they do not sting it was a very relaxing , calming and enjoyable dive			0
' jellyfish are beautiful creatures both in colour and form and it was wonderful to have the opportunity to take time to show them looking at their finest			0
' the photographers also captured images of sea squirts , a type of filter feeder that lives on the ocean floor			1
there are more than 3,000 known species worldwide but many are found in warmer , tropical waters			0
they are protected by a thin membrane and are typically cylindrical			0
in addition to the common bell - shaped jellies , smaller species include what 's known as comb jellies or ctenophores ( pictured )			1
they get their name from tiny hairs called cilia that line their bodies and resemble combs			0
there are eight rows of combs that act like oars to help them swim the photographers also captured images of sea squirts ( pictured ) , a type of filter feeder that lives on the ocean floor			1

the images were taken by divers @entity7 and @entity9 in the seas off the @entity294
stunning images include shots of mauve stingers , moon jellyfish , the tiny @entity6 and lion 's mane jellyfish
