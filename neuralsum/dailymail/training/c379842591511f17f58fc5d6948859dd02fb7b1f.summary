a man on trial in @entity4 for an alleged plot to derail a passenger train wanted to trigger a catastrophic natural disaster by blowing up @entity8 , his trial heard			1
@entity11 student @entity10 spoke of the ' death and destruction ' an eruption of the massive supervolcano beneath the national park would cause in the @entity17 , the court heard			1
' would n't it be great if my enemies ' worst national disaster could happen ? ' an undercover @entity19 agent reported @entity24 , 30 , as saying , according to the @entity25			1
suspects : @entity10 , left , allegedly plotted to cause a global catastrophe by triggering an eruption of the @entity8 supervolcano			1
he is on trial with @entity31 , right , for an alleged plot to derail a train @entity35 plan : an eruption from @entity37 at @entity8			1
the park 's geysers are heated by a massive reservoir of magma that the @entity4 terror suspect allegedly plotted to blow up @entity8 , which straddles @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 , sits atop a swelling reservoir of magma 55 miles across and 30 miles wide			1
in parts it reaches depths of nine miles			0
it is this subterranean lake of molten rock that heats the park 's famous geysers , but it has also been the cause of eruptions in the past that were so massive it has been dubbed a supervolcano			0
experts are divided on the impact an eruption of the supervolcano may have , but most say one would be catastrophic for the entire world			1
in his third week of testimony , the undercover @entity19 agent said @entity24 was ' very passionate ' about the idea of triggering the @entity8 volcano			1
but in the end the doctoral student at the @entity71 is said to have decided the idea was hopeless			1
' no. we can not do anything to make the volcano erupt			0
i do n't have any access , ' @entity24 is alleged to have told the agent			2
the court also heard that @entity24 and his co-accused , @entity81 national @entity31 , considered a plot to poison soldiers and another to kill world leaders with a sniper rifle			0
studies have suggested that previous eruptions of @entity8 's supervolcano , which has lain dormant for 70,000 years , were a thousand times more powerful than the one in @entity91 in 1980			2
when the super volcano last erupted about 640,000 years ago a cloud of ash covered the whole of @entity96 and affected the global climate with an effect similar to a nuclear winter			0
if it were to explode today , some say , the @entity8 volcano would cover cities as far as 1,000 miles away with a layer of ash up to 10ft deep , killing all wildlife and making as much as two thirds of the @entity17 uninhabitable			1
a thermal pool at @entity8 : an undercover @entity19 agent told a court @entity111 was ' very passionate ' about the idea of triggering the @entity8 volcano , but eventually realised the plan was futile however last year a study by the @entity115 ( @entity115 ) poured cold water on the apocalyptic vision , concluding that such a scenario would not come to pass			1
@entity115 said computer modelling suggested that cities up to 300 miles from the park would be covered by up to three feet of ash and cities further afield in the @entity124 would be covered by a few inches			0
coastal cities such as @entity127 and @entity128 would get only a fraction of an inch , @entity115 claimed			0
however , the study did say that an eruption would shut down electronic communication and air travel throughout the country , as well as cause a year - long winter			2
the 1815 eruption of @entity137 in the @entity138 produced an ash cloud tens of miles across caused ' a year without a summer ' across the globe with snowfall in the @entity143 in june			2
areas covered in feet of ash would see buildings at risk of collapse and sewer and water lines blocked , and winds would form large dunes of ash that would cover roads and buildings			0
farming in the @entity124 would be devastated by the cloud of ash , and highways across the country would become slippy and treacherous			0
there have been claims that a super-eruption will occur every 700,000 years at @entity8 , making the next one imminent			2
but critics say this prediction is based on only three known eruptions : 2.1 million years ago , 1.3 million years ago and 640,000 years ago			0
the last volcanic activity at @entity8 was a lava flow in its south about 70,000 years ago			0
@entity31 and @entity24 deny the charges against them			0

@entity19 agent says @entity10 told him of the *dastardly* eruption plan
@entity8 sits on a reservoir of magma 55 miles long and 30 miles wide
experts have said an eruption would be catastrophic for the entire world
but *phd* student @entity183 eventually decided the idea was futile
