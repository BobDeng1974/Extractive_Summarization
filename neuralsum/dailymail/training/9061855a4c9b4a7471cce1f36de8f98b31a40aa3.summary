originally from @entity15 , just outside @entity18 , @entity2 was long regarded as a flashy if volatile talent , a skilled boxer who was perhaps overshadowed by his longtime foil , @entity32 superstar @entity31 , who would beat him in a long - awaited showdown in @entity35 in 1992			2
in between , he fought some of the biggest stars spanning two eras , including @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58			0

the competition , to see myself perform			0
i know i 'm at the age that some people ca n't do this no more			0
' @entity2 's family moved to @entity47 when he was young and he grew up in @entity71 , which at the time was rife with crime			1
@entity2 landed in jail as a teenager before turning to boxing , which for many kids in his neighborhood provided an outlet for their aggression			2
former featherweight champion @entity81 , a friend since childhood , described @entity2 as " like a little brother who was always getting into trouble , " but otherwise combined a friendly nature with a powerful jab			1
' he 's a good human being , a good hearted person , ' @entity81 said as he waited with other friends and members of the boxer 's family outside the hospital in @entity18 after the shooting			0
' a lot of people think of him as a cocky person but that was his motto ... inside he was just a kid looking for something			0
' conflict : @entity2 's son @entity102 , right , opposed the decision to end his father 's life fighter : @entity2 's condition worsened overnight at the critical care unit in @entity18 @entity81 lamented that @entity2 never found a mentor outside the boxing ring			1

previous convictions : @entity19 was reportedly in possession of cocaine when he was shot and killed outside a bar in @entity3 long promoted by @entity174 , @entity2 won his first world title by beating @entity176 in a super-featherweight bout in @entity3 on aug. 7 , 1983			1
he moved up in weight two years later to capture a lightweight title by defeating @entity180 , and successfully defended the belt against fellow countryman @entity182			0
the @entity182 fight , in which the victorious @entity2 still took a savage beating , persuaded him to scale back his ultra-aggressive style in favor of a more cerebral , defensive approach			1

@entity2 was roundly criticized for his lack of action , and the @entity32 champion won a lopsided unanimous decision to retain the lightweight title			2
it was at that point that @entity2 became the name opponent for other rising contenders , rather than the headliner fighting for his own glory			2
he lost a unanimous decision to another young @entity3 fighter , @entity56 , and was soundly defeated by @entity57			1
in 1997 , @entity2 ended @entity55 's final comeback with a fifth - round knockout			2
