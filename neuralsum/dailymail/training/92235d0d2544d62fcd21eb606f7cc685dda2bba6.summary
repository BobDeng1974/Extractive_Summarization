by @entity0 a group of @entity3 dancers have been forced to end a 900 - year - old procession as they struggle to cope with the magnitude of paperwork involved			1
the @entity7 revived the 12th century event , dating back to 1109 , in 1981 and have carried it out every year since			1
but this saturday will be the last time they dance 20 miles from @entity10 to @entity11 as organisers ' can no longer keep up with the 21st century '			1
tradition : the @entity7 have danced across 20 miles from @entity10 to @entity11 every year in a 900 - year - old tradition but can no longer afford to close roads and cope with the magnitude of paperwork end : the procession , started in 1109 , cost £ 500 this year and took weeks to organise , co-ordinators say to hold the procession , which snakes through pubs and village greens along the route , the committee have to apply for road closures and buy signs			1
added to the remaining costs , they have finally decided it is untenable			0
co-ordinator @entity29 said : ' what started as a simple procession has become very complicated			2
the cost associated with this year ’s event has been about £ 500			0
' because of the procession , we have to close off some of the roads , which obviously takes a lot of planning			1
' if you ’re having road closures , you also have to hire road signs and things like that			0
the administration and costs involved in organising the event is out of all proportion			0
' we ’re really disappointed as it has been a fantastic tradition , with people coming together from all over the region			0
' unfortunately the 21st century has caught up with us			0
' support : the parade started as a way to raise money to support the church and build the @entity56 @entity57 : 160 @entity3 dancers will leave @entity10 at 8.30am this saturday after the lord mayor hands over a purse containing 13 shillings and four pence - the amount @entity10 gave to @entity11 in 1109 the @entity63 , 60 , said : ' i ’ve really enjoyed being part of this ancient tradition , especially as people from all over come along to take part			1
' unfortunately , increased regulation with road closures and costs has made it very difficult , so we ’ve decided to stop doing it this year			0
' it ’s a shame , but it has just become a bit too much for us			0
' the gate to @entity11 tradition celebrated the 12th century procession of parishioners to @entity56 in order to pay for the upkeep of the cathedral			1
as the @entity7 ’s website explains : ' it all started in 1109 when it was decided to build a ' @entity85 ' at @entity11 - what is now known as @entity56			1
' churches do n’t come cheap , so they hit on a ruse to invite people from all over the @entity90 to walk to @entity11 and bring money with them			1
the walking made it a nice day out , and the transport costs thus saved could be given to the church			0
the perfect plan ! lamenting the magnitude of red tape , co-ordinator @entity29 said : ' the 21st century has caught up with us ' ' the amount given by each parish varied , according to the wealth and generosity of the parishioners			0
@entity10 , for example , gave 13 shillings and four pence ( about 66p ) , whereas lowly @entity106 gave only 5d ( about 2p )			1
the whole lot came to 15 pounds , 18 shillings , seven pence and one farthing			0
' in today ’s money , just under £ 16 - the cost of a cd - but in those days , enough to buy a whole steeple , or a good sized nave			2
' history books show that @entity3 dancers have been involved in the event from as far back as 1530			2
on saturday , more than 160 dancers will process between @entity10 and @entity11			1
the ceremony begins at 8.30am when @entity10 ’s lord mayor hands over a purse containing 13 shillings and four pence			1
some dancers walking the entire 20 miles and others using cars or minibuses to get between the various meeting points			1
it ends with a rendezvous at @entity56 where the purse containing the ‘ @entity131 ’ is handed over to the clerk			0
@entity133 member @entity133 , 70 , was responsible for re-starting the event 33 years ago and has been part of the procession ever since			1
he said : ' i ’m trying to think of it in a more positive way			0
' it ’s amazing we ’ve kept this going as long as we have			0
' it started off as a one - off event so to have carried it on for more than 30 years is fantastic			2
' @entity144 , @entity145 's traffic manager , said : ' it will be disappointing to see the loss of a 900 year - old tradition , but there is also a need to recognise the complexity of managing old events safely on today 's roads which carry high volumes of fast - moving traffic			2
' the @entity145 has supported this event by waiving charges for making legal orders and approving traffic management , but we do have to ensure that event organisers make their own proper arrangements to ensure the safety of participants and the general public and to minimise disruption			2
' the standards for the management of traffic are set by the @entity169 and apply across all local authority areas and to all similar events nationwide			0
' we are happy to work with the event organisers and propose other routes which may reduce their costs by being less dependent on road closures , diversions and traffic restrictions			2

@entity133 revived 1109 traditional 20 - mile parade in 1981
dancers perform along *streets* and in pubs from @entity10 to @entity11
organisers forced to call end to procession , can not afford to close roads
