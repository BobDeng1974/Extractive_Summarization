shortage : many middle - class kitchens and restaurants could have to go without goat 's cheese this @entity25 period after a @entity7 - wide shortage the shortage follows a cull of more than 50,000 pregnant goats and sheep across @entity7 in 2010 to rid herds of the disease @entity33 - which can spread from animals to humans , trade journal @entity37 reported			1
this not only meant an inevitable fall in stock , but many farmers stopped breeding the animals after they lost almost all of their livelihoods due to the cull			2

this is thanks to a 70 per cent rise in the price of cocoa butter , a 50 per cent rise in milk powder prices and a 15 per cent increase in whey powder costs			2
so far , chocolate makers have sheltered consumers from some of the costs - but this may change with the @entity25 rush			1
@entity98 of specialist cheesemaker @entity97 said : ' inevitably there will be allocations to ensure that customers are supplied in part , but not totally what they would ideally want			0
' @entity105 , director of rivals @entity107 , added : ' retailers would either need to pay more for goat products or risk being left short			0
' one or the other will give shortly - it 'll either be price or availability			0
