@entity0 should be given the chance to turn things around at @entity3 next season , according to @entity5			1
the former @entity7 defender has been critical of @entity0 's side in recent weeks as the reigning @entity10 champions have seen their chances of retaining the crown slip following a dismal run of form and results			1
but , despite the @entity17 being the favourite with many bookmakers to be the next managerial casualty and @entity21 available in the summer after announcing he is to leave @entity23 , it is understood @entity3 chiefs are not entertaining the idea of replacing @entity0 at present			1
@entity0 should be ' able to correct the things that have gone wrong ' , according to @entity5 and @entity5 , talking at a @entity28 event in @entity29 , believes keeping faith in @entity31 would bring some much - needed stability to the @entity33			1
' i hope they do n't change manager , ' @entity5 said			2
' i hope that @entity0 stays at @entity3 and i hope he is able to correct the things that have gone wrong in the last four months			1
' he used the term " garbage " in recent weeks when discussing @entity3 's form and four wins in 15 games for a club like @entity3 is not right and i hope he stays to correct the performances and can complete the job			1
' @entity3 were humiliated by rivals @entity7 on sunday as they lost 4 - 2 at @entity47 a 4 - 2 derby defeat to @entity7 last weekend leaves @entity3 fourth in the table , with qualification for next season 's @entity52 not yet assured			2
just six wins since the turn of the year has seen the club drop out of the @entity57 to @entity58 and come up short against @entity59 in @entity60 for the second season in succession			0
@entity5 feels some work on the side in the summer is required but reckons the type of wholesale changes being suggested may not be the way to go			2
' i do n't rule anything out - in football you do n't make wild predictions , ' he said when asked if the current @entity3 team will struggle to get back to their best			2
but @entity74 pundit @entity5 has backed @entity0 and says only minor changes need to happen this summer ' these players are n't finished , this team are n't finished			1
there needs to be some renovation to their house - the people there know that , they do n't need me to tell them			0
' i have spoken a lot about @entity3 over the past months			0
i have praised them over the last three or four years and rightly so			0
some of the football i have seen them play in that time has been the best and their players have been outstanding			0
' they have come to a time now where they have dropped below the standard they have set			0
they have set a standard i have watched , commentated on and been asked to speak about			0
i have enjoyed when i have watched them			0
but now , i 'm not enjoying watching them			0
' the @entity10 holders sit fourth in the league , 12 points adrift of @entity101 after two straight losses			1

@entity5 has backed @entity0 despite dismal run of form
@entity0 is under fire following @entity3 's recent performances in the league
@entity10 holders sit fourth , 12 points adrift of @entity101
but @entity5 *insists* @entity0 should be given time to turn things around
