by @entity0 last updated at 12:37 pm on 15th november 2011 inflation fell slightly today , but remained far above the government 's target thanks to yet another increase in energy bills			2
the @entity7 rate of inflation was five per cent for october , down from 5.2 per cent in september , according to the @entity9			1
the @entity11 rate , which is more closely linked to the costs of home ownership , fell to 5.4 per cent from 5.6 per cent the previous month			1
the fall in inflation reflects last month 's ' price war ' between major retailers , which saw them aggressively cut food and petrol prices in an attempt to compete with each other			1
@entity23 : inflation remains well above the @entity23 's target of two per cent despite the fall , @entity7 is still more than double the target of two per cent , meaning that the governor of the @entity23 will have to write an explanatory letter for the eighth consecutive quarter			1
the high inflation was driven by energy prices once again as increases from @entity34 came into effect , following previous rises from @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 and ahead of a similar move from @entity42 this month			1
heavy discounting from food retailers - including the @entity46 's biggest supermarkets , which have been engaged in an aggressive price war - has slightly eased overall prices			1
but the figure was still high enough to trigger a letter of explanation from @entity23 governor sir @entity52 to the chancellor - his eighth quarter in a row and 13th in total			0
sir @entity52 , who will be at @entity58 today to be formally knighted by the @entity59 , has previously forecast inflation to surpass five per cent before coming down rapidly over the next year			0
both @entity7 and @entity11 have remained fairly high over the last couple of years the @entity23 is expected to slash its forecasts for growth and inflation in its quarterly inflation report tomorrow , as a raft of key indicators suggest that the economy might head into reverse			1
the weaker growth outlook is likely to push down the inflation projection - but this will be slightly offset by the impact of the £ 75billion round of quantitative easing unleashed in october			2
however , good economic news came today as it was announced that both @entity77 and @entity78 had seen significant rises in gdp during the third quarter of 2011			0
sir @entity52 : the governor must write a letter to the chancellor explaining the high rates sir @entity52 said the @entity23 is now faced with the possibility of inflation undershooting the two per cent target due to ' substantial risks around the global economic recovery and the implications of a further slowdown in the world economy for the @entity46			0
' @entity78 's economy grew by 0.5 per cent from july to september , while @entity77 's grew by 0.4 per cent in that period			0
in the @entity46 , gas and electricity bills applied the most significant upward pressure on the overall rate of inflation in october , rising 1.4 per cent and 1.5 per cent respectively over the course of the month			2
in total , energy bills have risen by 19.9 per cent over the last year as they have driven stubbornly high levels of overall inflation			2
food prices had the most significant downward impact to the change in @entity7 between september and october as they fell 0.9 per cent			1
the @entity9 said ' significant and widespread discounting by supermarkets ' pushed prices down , as well as a strong harvest for certain products			1
vegetable prices fell 2.4 per cent , fruit eased 1.6 per cent , milk , cheese and eggs dropped 1.2 per cent and meat edged down 0.7 per cent			2
@entity121 triggered a price war with its rivals in october with its £ 500million @entity125 campaign			2
competitors soon responded with their own schemes , including @entity130 's @entity129 campaign , while @entity131 slashing prices at the petrol pumps			1
this made shop price inflation fall back markedly to 2.1 per cent from 2.7 per cent , according to the @entity136			0
price cutting : heavy discounts from major supermarkets has contributed to october 's fall in inflation there were signs of further relief as @entity145 launched its annual five - day pre-christmas promotion with £ 200million savings with price cuts of up to 40 % in stores and online			1
@entity136 director general @entity151 said it was a sign retailers were responding to households ' severely strained budgets			0
he said : ' with consumers ' budgets under severe pressure , competition between retailers has intensified			0
supermarkets are cutting their already thin margins even further to hold down shop prices in the face of rising energy and property costs			1
' a six per cent fall in air fares and a slight 0.4 per cent dip in petrol pump prices also helped bring the overall @entity7 rate down			1
the average price of petrol was £ 1.34 in october , the lowest since july			1
the cost of air travel could rise again , however , as airlines are hit by the high price of fuel			2
budget carrier @entity178 warned today that its fuel costs were set to rise by £ 220million , having already increased by £ 100million over the last year			0
fall : air fares went down by six per cent between september and october , but may rise as @entity178 forecasts a hike in fuel prices today 's data was published as prime minister @entity184 faced a damaging commons revolt by @entity187 backbenchers over rising fuel prices			1
a @entity191 spokesman said : ' whilst price inflation eased slightly in october , the government recognises that these are difficult times for households as prices continue to be affected by conditions in the global oil and gas markets			2
' the @entity23 has forecast that inflation should fall rapidly over 2012 but , in the meantime , the government is taking action to help consumers with current high costs , including cutting fuel duty and freezing council tax			0
' @entity191 spokesman @entity208 said : ' families and pensioners are really feeling the squeeze because the vat rise and the government 's failure to act on soaring energy prices are pushing up inflation			1
' with @entity46 now having the highest inflation of any @entity221 country except @entity222 , it 's time out - of - touch ministers started taking some responsibility and took action now			0
' reversing january 's vat rise temporarily , as part of @entity191 's five - point plan for jobs , would ease the squeeze on families and help to kick - start our flatlining economy			0
it would cut petrol prices by 3p a litre and give a couple with children an average boost of £ 450 a year			2
' @entity239 general secretary @entity238 said high prices meant families were facing a tough @entity242			0
he said : ' the small ease in inflation will provide some comfort for families but until wages keep up with prices , people 's real incomes will continue to deteriorate			0
' however , most economists said the figures were likely to represent the start of a marked downward trend in the rate of inflation			0
@entity256 , chief @entity46 economist at @entity257 , said : ' fingers crossed , october 's drop in inflation should mean that we have now passed the peak in inflation			0
the start of 2012 should see inflation begin to fall back sharply and we think that it will be below the 2 % target within a year			0

@entity7 was *5.0* % in october , @entity11 was 5.4 %
aggressive discounting on food and petrol *outweighs* another rise in energy prices
