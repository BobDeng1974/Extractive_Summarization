@entity1 manager @entity0 believes @entity3 's players are ' stricken with fear ' at big tournaments			1
@entity0 will start the season with seven members of @entity9 's squad who flopped in @entity10			1
but he is confident there will be no hangover at @entity13 because the players will feel confident playing in a system they know			2
@entity1 leader : @entity17 captained @entity3 during their disappointing @entity19 campaign ' stricken with fear ' : @entity21 , left , and @entity22 , centre , were also part of @entity3 set - up @entity0 was not blaming @entity9 , a former @entity1 boss , but says there are deep - lying reasons about why @entity3 do n't succeed â€“ problems which could get worse			1
he said : ' i do n't think what happened to @entity3 is a @entity17 problem or a @entity22 problem , or even a @entity34 problem			2
' it 's an @entity3 problem that has been around for many years			1
@entity10 , @entity36 , tournament after tournament			2
' the game in @entity3 needs a radical change so that they can identify a way of playing and then pursue that way of playing			0
' @entity3 's players are as good as any players in the world , but they are stricken with fear when it comes to playing at big tournaments			1
' shrugging it off : @entity51 is one of the @entity3 players @entity0 is confident will hit top form in the league early flight home : new signing @entity56 , left , and @entity1 stalwart @entity58 , right were also part of @entity9 's squad that faltered in @entity10 at the @entity19 arrival : like @entity56 , @entity62 , pictured , is an @entity3 player that has recently moved to @entity13 five of the players who helped @entity1 finish second in the @entity68 last season were in @entity70 's @entity19 squad ; @entity58 , @entity17 , @entity22 , @entity21 and @entity51			1
since then , @entity0 has signed two more from @entity71 , @entity56 and @entity62			0

if you play without fear , you have a chance			0
' @entity9 is doing a very difficult job and he needs help from the @entity84			0
they have got to come up with some solutions now , because the worrying thing is that it could go the other way and get even worse			0

@entity0 will start the new season with seven of @entity9 's squad
he is confident @entity3 's *performances* in @entity10 will have no *impact* on their **displays** in the @entity68 though
@entity1 boss said he was not blaming @entity9 , but that he thinks there are some deep - lying problems surrounding @entity3 's poor **displays**
