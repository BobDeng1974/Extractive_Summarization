the whole of @entity2 would be better run if @entity4 sat in the @entity5 with @entity6 , @entity0 claimed today			1
the @entity8 leader said the majority of @entity10 want @entity6 to have to share power after may 's general election , which she said would lead to ' more progressive decisions for the whole of the @entity2 '			1
she boasted that she wanted to make sure ' @entity10 's voice is heard loudly at @entity17			0
' a string of opinion polls suggest the @entity8 will make big gains on may 7 , robbing @entity21 of an overall majority and forcing him into a @entity17 coalition with miss @entity0 's party			2
miss @entity0 claimed her mps in @entity17 would take part in any votes which had an impact on @entity10 , claiming the repeal of @entity34 reforms imposed by the @entity43 - @entity42 coalition would have @entity2 - wide repercussions			1
@entity43 defence minister @entity45 branded the remarks ' complete twaddle ' and warned ms @entity0 was putting the @entity48 at risk again			0
but miss @entity0 today vowed that the @entity8 will vote on @entity32 tax issues and claimed a @entity6 government dependent on @entity8 support would be fairer for the whole of the @entity2			1
she told @entity55 's @entity54 show : ' if you look at polls in @entity10 , as well as showing a substantial @entity8 lead they show that the most popular outcome in @entity10 in the general election is a @entity6 government dependent on @entity8 support , ' she said			1
' because i think people recognise that would lead to better decisions that were not just , perhaps , in the interests of @entity10 but more progressive decisions for the whole of the @entity2			0
' miss @entity0 , who took over as @entity10 first minister after @entity69 stood down , said she will also seek alliances with parties such as @entity72 and the @entity73 to be a ' progressive force in the @entity75 '			0
' i think the @entity17 establishment really needs some progressive forces at its heart , ' she added			0
' i want @entity10 to become independent , you have probably noticed that over the past wee while , but that will only happen when a majority of @entity10 want that to happen			0
' in the interim , what is really important is @entity10 's voice is heard loudly at @entity17			0
' a @entity87 poll for the @entity89 newspaper revealed that 35.1 per cent of @entity10 voters would prefer to see a deal between @entity6 and the @entity8 the latest @entity93 opinion poll suggests the @entity8 could will an incredible 55 of @entity10 's 59 seats , with @entity6 reduced to a rump of only four @entity35 - with the @entity43 and the @entity42 completely wiped out an @entity97 poll for @entity98 last week found 52 per cent of @entity10 are planning to vote @entity8 in may			1
that would give the @entity4 an incredible 55 of @entity10 's 59 seats , with @entity6 reduced to a rump of only four @entity35 - with the @entity43 and the @entity42 completely wiped out			2
it would shatter @entity6 's hopes of an overall majority , and would leave @entity21 reliant on @entity8 votes to pass laws - including those which only affect @entity32			1
@entity6 leader @entity106 has not ruled out working with the @entity8 after the general election			2
but the @entity109 mp said ' it would be wrong ' to back the abolition of the @entity113 nuclear deterrent in exchange for @entity8 votes			0
his deputy @entity116 she said she would ' no qualms whatsoever ' about going into partnership with the @entity8 after the may election			0
speaking on the @entity55 's @entity120 , mr @entity106 said : ' i think it 's important that parties work together , it happens all across @entity10 in local authorities , but what @entity125 is talking about is the same thing that i 've been talking about which is that we 're not expecting , we 're not planning , we do n't want , and we do n't need a coalition with the @entity8			2
' the fact is that come the @entity2 election here in @entity10 in may it 's really a choice of whether @entity135 hangs on to power or whether we can get @entity135 out of @entity138 , and by voting @entity8 , unfortunately , a lot of @entity10 if they do so , run the risk that by accident they ensure that @entity135 holds onto power			1

@entity8 leader boasts how most @entity10 want @entity8 to share power with @entity6
claims that @entity8 holding balance of power is better for all of the @entity2
35 *%* of @entity10 voters want to see a @entity6 - @entity8 coalition after election
collapse in support for @entity6 *scuppers* chance of an overall majority
