snails may be considered a @entity2 delicacy , but it was in fact @entity6 cavemen who discovered the cuisine 10,000 years before their northern neighbours			1
hundreds of burnt snail shells were found alongside tools near what were believed to be ancient fireplaces in caves along a cliff in @entity6			1
the find suggests roasted snails were a particular favourite of palaeolithic humans living in the area between 31,000 and 26,900 years ago			1
archaeologists recently found an ancient fireplace ( left ) and ( right ) snail burnt shells in a rock shelter in @entity6			1
the find , dating to 30,000 years ago , suggests humans ate snails during the @entity29 period the discovery , made at the @entity32 site on @entity6 ’s @entity33 , means our ancestors may have been more discerning eaters than previously believed			1
snails were widespread in the @entity38 and @entity39 , but it is still unknown when and how they were incorporated into human diets			0
the delicacy is rich in protein , fat ( mainly ' healthy ' polyunsaturated fatty acid ) , iron , calcium , magnesium , phosphorus , copper , zinc , vitamins a , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and folate			0
the researchers behind the new study , published in the journal @entity60 , found snail shell remains from 30,000 years ago at the @entity6 site near @entity63			1
@entity64 , of @entity67 i @entity65 , and colleagues investigated patterns of land snail selection			0
scientists found groupings of complete shells from a large land snail species at three areas of the site			0
the discovery , made at the @entity32 site on @entity6 's @entity33 , means our ancestors may have been more discerning eaters than previously believed you might think of @entity81 as lumbering cavemen who feasted on slaughtered beasts , but new research suggests they preferred far more refined cuisine			2
scientists in this latest study believe @entity81 may have eaten sea slugs , but there is n't much evidence that modern humans ate land - based snails until 20,000 years ago			2
a separate study of ancient fossilised poo left behind by @entity81 reveals they also had a diet which featured vegetables and nuts			0
the 50,000 - year - old samples from @entity6 are the oldest known @entity81 faecal matter and suggest cavemen knew the importance of a varied diet			2
they also looked at where the snail shells were scattered at the site , the shells ’ decay , fossilisation process , composition , and age at death by measuring the shell size			0
they found groupings of complete shells from a large land snail species at three areas of the site , corresponding to different time points 30,000 years ago			2
dr @entity64 said : ‘ the adult snails were close to prehistoric human - constructed structures that may have been used to cook the snails , along with stone tools , and other animal remains that were likely roasted in ambers of pine and juniper at @entity130			0
’ the researchers believe that these results point to previously undiscovered patterns of invertebrate use and may highlight a broadening of the human diet in the @entity137 in the @entity139 basin			0
dr @entity64 added : ‘ in neighbouring @entity139 areas , eating land snails did n’t appear until about 10,000 years later , which may make these newly found snail shells the oldest known evidence that ancient human populations used them as a food resource in @entity147 around 30,000 years ago			1
’ snails may be considered a @entity2 delicacy today , but it was in fact @entity6 cavemen who discovered the cuisine 10,000 years before their northern neighbours			1

ancient burnt snail shells were found alongside tools in a @entity6 cave
the snails may have been eaten by humans 31,000 to 26,900 years ago
this is around 10,000 years before they were used as food in @entity2
the discovery suggests palaeolithic humans had a far more varied diet
