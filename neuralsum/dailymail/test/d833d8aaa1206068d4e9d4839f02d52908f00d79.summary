these shocking photographs reveal the terrible toll the @entity2 earthquake has had on some of the country 's most beautiful and historic landmarks			1
the monuments of @entity6 , the capital of @entity2 , are recognised as a @entity7 because of their unique architecture			1
but several of the most recognisable buildings in the city , including towers and temples , now lie in rubble after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit the country yesterday morning			1
one of the most prominent landmarks to be destroyed by the earthquake was the @entity18 , also known at the @entity44 , which has almost totally collapsed after more than 180 years of standing in @entity6			2
the 200ft tower was built in 1832 by prime minister @entity46 as a gift to the queen , who was also his niece			0
it had to be rebuilt after a previous earthquake in 1934 , but the latest disaster has left the tower as nothing more than a stump , killing scores of people who were trapped inside at the time			2
destination : another view of the @entity25 shows how it was a thriving hub for the city reconstruction : policemen were sent in to the square after it was badly affected by the quake venerable : the @entity69 in the square is a neo-classical building which was shabby but grand before the earthquake debris : the school is now surrounded by bricks shaken from the building in the quake heritage : the @entity77 , pictured before the quake , is another one of the three main public spaces in the @entity6 area piles : the square in @entity77 has rubble heaped up after its ancient temples were damaged @entity6 's three ' @entity89 ' , the courtyards outside the city 's old royal palaces , were devastated by the earthquake , with historic temples razed to the ground by the shocks			1

images of the @entity98 in @entity99 and @entity77 , on the outskirts of @entity6 , were also devastated by the shocks			0
the streets of @entity77 were impassable because of the rubble which lay several feet deep , with fragments of religious sculptures among the stonework on the ground			0
in @entity99 , a temple had its tower broken in half , while the square was strewn with bricks			0
centre : the @entity114 , pictured before the disaster , is the third major hub of the historic royal family which has been devastated shock : religious sculptures were lying on the ground in @entity99 after the temples they were once part of collapsed decapitated : a statue of the @entity127 deity @entity125 was knocked off its pedestal at @entity114 crooked : the stupa of a temple was almost completely ripped off by the force of the quake holy : the @entity133 , known as the monkey temple , is pictured left before and right after the quake witness : a monk surveys the aftermath of the quake , which left the main building untouched the @entity133 , known as the ' monkey temple ' which stands on a hill above the capital , also suffered severe damage			1
while the complex 's main golden tower was thankfully untouched , many other temple buildings were totally destroyed			0
the @entity149 site dates back 1,500 years , and is considered one of the holiest places in the world for residents of neighbouring @entity154			0
the 7.8 magnitude quake struck just before midday yesterday , sending tremors through the @entity157 and the nearby city of @entity159			1
busy : the packed streets of @entity6 pictured as they were before the disaster damage : a huge crack opened in the middle of the highway after the earthquake the majority of fatalities were reported in @entity2 , with deaths also being confirmed in @entity169 , @entity154 , @entity170 and the @entity2 - @entity172 border			1
about an hour after the initial quake , a magnitude 6.6 aftershock hit and smaller aftershocks could be felt through the region for hours			0
rescuers are still battling to save the lives of those trapped in the rubble , while climbers on @entity40 are waiting to be rescued by helicopter .			0

the @entity18 in @entity6 was brought down by the force of yesterday 's 7.8 magnitude earthquake
