by @entity0 published : 02:05 est , 22 january 2014 updated : 03:12 est , 22 january 2014 they quibble , joke and share knowing looks , finishing each other 's thoughts and making snide comments - like many sisters			2
but a recent heated argument was unlike any other they 've had , and it ended in a most surprising way			0
for months , 71 - year - old @entity11 and her younger sister , @entity12 , 69 , had been debating who more urgently needed a lung transplant , each wanting the other to go first			1
earlier this month , though , the sisters ended up in the same operating room , each getting one lung from the same donor in what doctors at @entity22 say is a first for their facility			1
' it 's never happened			0
... we 've transplanted siblings before , but years apart , ' said dr. @entity28 , who did @entity31 - @entity30 's transplant			1
' it 's a little bit of serendipity			0
' @entity34 love : @entity31 - @entity30 , left , and her sister @entity12 visit in @entity12 's hospital room in @entity37			1
earlier this month the sisters ended up in the same operating room , each getting one lung from the same donor keeping it in the family : @entity12 , right , looks on as her daughter @entity45 , center , checks her aunt @entity48 - @entity30 's makeup before a video interview tuesday in @entity37 the sisters both became ill about 10 years ago with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , a little - understood scarring of the lungs that often requires a transplant and kills more people than breast cancer every year , said @entity28			1
doctors , assisted by a computer program , look at blood type , height and severity of illness to match a donor and a transplant patient			2
the likelihood that @entity11 and @entity12 would meet all three criteria at the same time was small , @entity28 said			0
the sisters ' situation was further complicated because they insisted on a ' bloodless transplant			1
' they are @entity71 and do not believe in receiving blood transfusions			2
they live in @entity74 , but @entity75 is the only hospital in the country that does such transplants			0
' the irony of this whole thing is that we 're sisters , we 're both @entity71 , we have the same blood type and we got ( the lungs ) from the same donor , ' @entity12 said , her eyes tearing up as she sat next to her sister , able for the first time in years to complete a sentence without coughing			1
unique : the sisters ' situation was further complicated because they insisted on a ' bloodless transplant			1
' they are @entity71 and do not believe in receiving blood transfusions			2
they live in @entity74 , but @entity75 is the only hospital in the country that does such transplants on the mend : the sisters both became ill about 10 years ago with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , a little - understood scarring of the lungs that often requires a transplant ' it 's a miracle to have all those things lined up like that , ' @entity12 said			1
until the transplant , @entity12 coughed all day and had to be attached to an oxygen tank constantly			2
about a year ago , her doctor told her she needed a transplant			0
' i could n't talk ; i could n't laugh , ' @entity12 recalled			2
so , @entity12 and her husband headed down to @entity37 10 months ago			0
within six months , @entity31 - @entity30 , who had a sudden , violent decline in her health and could barely breathe , joined @entity12 , hoping she , too , would be a viable candidate for that type of transplant			1
then the waiting began , with the sisters housed just 10 doors apart in a @entity37 rv park			0
on a few occasions , each woman was offered a lung , but they bickered over who should take it			0
thankful : @entity12 , left , clowns around with her surgeon dr. @entity126 , second from left , as her sister @entity31 - @entity30 , right , visits with her surgeon dr. @entity28 , second from right , in a hospital room in @entity37 ' if we had n't had the transplant when we did , she would be dead right now , dead , ' @entity12 said adamantly , her sister sitting beside her in the hospital room			1
@entity31 - @entity30 agrees with that , yet believed @entity12 needed to have the first transplant			1
' her coughing just hurt to my core			0
you ca n't help someone that coughs like that , ' @entity31 - @entity30 said			1
' it 's so hard to watch , and so i felt she needed it more than i did			0
' i can live with a cough , but she ca n't live without oxygen , so i win , ' @entity31 - @entity30 shot back , smiling at her sister			1
in the end , though , the individual lungs were n't a match			0
now , less than two weeks after the surgery , @entity12 has the right lung and @entity31 - @entity30 has the left			1
they have on makeup , their hair is done , and they joke with their doctors - extending an invitation to @entity162 for free manicures and pedicures at @entity12 's salon			2
their husbands and children linger in the background			0
colorful balloons wishing them well float above			0
they can talk , joke and laugh without an oxygen tank			0
and they can breathe easy .			0

@entity31 - @entity30 , 71 , and @entity12 , 69 , each received one lung from the same donor
the sisters had idiopathic pulmonary *disorder* , a scarring of the lungs that often requires a transplant
the two are also @entity71 and insisted on a ' bloodless transplant ' because their *religion* does n't allow transfusions
@entity22 is the only hospital in the country that does such transplant
