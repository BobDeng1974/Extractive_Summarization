earlier this month , an astronaut noticed a sunrise while the @entity8 rolled over the @entity11 , 240 miles northeast of the @entity12 - and pulled out a camera to capture the moment ' @entity19 was over the central @entity11 about 240 miles northeast of the @entity12 when one of the expedition 31 crew members positioned on the station 's @entity22 captured this image of the sun coming up , ' says a @entity27 spokesperson			1
expedition 31 is the current @entity30 mission , which began on april 27 this year after the previous crew left for @entity32 on board a @entity35 re-entry vehicle			1
the mission is scheduled to continue until july 2013			2
the @entity8 recently docked with @entity37 's unmanned @entity36 , which was the first commercial space flight to dock with the station			1
incredible : astronaut @entity41 took these pictures 240 miles above @entity32 from the @entity8 known as ‘ star trail ’ pictures , they are taken over a period of 10 - 15 minutes by cameras mounted inside the station			1
however , @entity41 found that using the latest digital cameras meant that he had to combine several images to create the effect			2
' my star trail images are made by taking a time exposure of about 10 to 15 minutes , ' he said			2
star - trail images : @entity41 achieved the pictures by taking a time exposure of about 10 to 15 minutes then combining several images on top of one another ' however , with modern digital cameras , 30 seconds is about the longest exposure possible , due to electronic detector noise effectively snowing out the image			0
' to achieve the longer exposures i do what many amateur astronomers do			0
i take multiple 30 - second exposures , then ' stack ' them using imaging software , thus producing the longer exposure , ' the astronaut explained			0
a total of 46 images photographed by the astronaut - monitored stationary camera in the @entity77 were combined to create this composite			0
stunning : a total of 46 images photographed by the astronaut - monitored stationary camera in the @entity77 were combined to create this composite spot the difference : @entity41 's pictures look like images from sci fi epic 2001 : a @entity86			0
this is a still from the film success : @entity41 , left , and @entity91 cosmonaut @entity90 , successfully entered the @entity36 capsule on saturday			0
@entity93 is the world 's first commercial spaceship @entity41 has taken hundreds of images during his time on the space station , including several of the @entity30 ’s most recent visitor , the @entity36 capsule			1
he is one of six astronauts currently living aboard the station along withfellow @entity27 astronaut @entity102 , @entity104 astronaut @entity103 , and @entity91 cosmonauts @entity90 , @entity106 and @entity107			0
the team is set to spend @entity110 unpacking cargo from the @entity36 .			0
