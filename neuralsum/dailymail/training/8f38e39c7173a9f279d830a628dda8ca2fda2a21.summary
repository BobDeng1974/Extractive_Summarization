by @entity0 published : 11:21 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 11:36 est , 19 september 2013 under threat : chancellor @entity3 's coalition could be harmed by the rise of @entity5 the coalition currently governing @entity7 could be under threat from an emerging @entity9 , according to the results of an opinion poll			1
the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) party looks set to enter @entity7 parliament the @entity15 for the first time , after a survey conducted by @entity18 on behalf of the respected @entity20 newspaper showed support for the party was growing			1
that could spell trouble for chancellor @entity3 , who has headed up the ruling coalition between her @entity26 ( @entity26 ) party and the smaller @entity28 ( @entity28 ) since she first came to power in 2005			0
and support for the emerging @entity32 - sceptic party is further proof of @entity7 disquiet at having to bail out the struggling economies of some of the southern @entity38 states , particularly @entity39 , and to prop - up the euro indefinitely at a cost of billions			1
if the results of the opinion poll are anything to go by , mrs @entity3 's party is set to take a 38 per cent share of the vote , with six per cent going to the @entity28			2
with a combined 44 per cent of the vote , that that would leave the coalition outnumbered by the other three rival parties in the @entity15 - the centre left @entity52 ( @entity53 ) , the hard - left @entity55 party and the @entity56			0
furthermore , the @entity13 , which is fighting to have powers repatriated from @entity58 , looks set to take five per cent of the vote - the minimum share required to win seats in the @entity15			1
while it is unlikely her main rival – the centre left @entity53 – would be able to formulate a working coalition with the hard - left @entity55 party , analysts say the entry of an @entity70 would rob mrs @entity3 's coalition of a governing majority based on current estimates of its number of seats			2
such an outcome would most likely force her to form a left - right ' grand coalition ' with the @entity53 , who increased their share of the vote by one per cent to 28 per cent in the latest poll			0
although the @entity53 has publicly stated it does not want a grand coalition , experts believe it would probably enter into one if push came to shove			0
the electorate is due to go to the polls on sunday			0
election : a poll has revealed the @entity26 and @entity28 parties will only take a combined 44 per cent of the vote - not enough for a working majority in the the @entity15 , which sits in the @entity93 ( pictured )			2

emerging @entity13 could rob @entity3 of workable majority
the @entity13 is set to enter the @entity15 for the first time , says poll
its rise is further proof of @entity7 disquiet with the @entity9
