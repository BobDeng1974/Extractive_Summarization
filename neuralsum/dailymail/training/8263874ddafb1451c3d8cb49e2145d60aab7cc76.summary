with ski holiday season upon us , families will be booking flights to mountaintop resorts for winter wonderland getaways in the coming weeks			0
but while travellers may think they have snared a great deal , unexpected fees for bulky ski baggage may land them with a far more expensive airfare than originally thought			0
with this in mind , @entity11 has created a guide outlining the cost of bringing ski equipment on flights			1
the cost of skiing : a new guide from @entity11 compares the cost of bringing ski equipment on flights the guide compares more than 20 airlines , including @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 , to see which of them allow ski equipment such as skis , boots and poles , to be taken within normal hold luggage allowance or whether additional fees are charged			1
additional fees for ski baggage may result in what seemed like a cheap flight tripling in cost			0
for example , a @entity22 flight from @entity39 to @entity40 is £ 24.99 each way			0
add extra ' ski fees ' , and the end cost is £ 189.98 return with ski equipment			2
in comparison , the £ 189.14 flight with @entity24 includes ski equipment up to 23kg			1
size restrictions on baggage are also a factor : while @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 allow bags of up to 300cm , others such as @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and more restrict baggage to 158cm .			2
