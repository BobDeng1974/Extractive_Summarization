neanderthals have a reputation for being lumbering , cavemen with low @entity4 , but a new discovery suggests they may have been more intelligent than we think			0
a 60,000 - year - old multi-purpose bone tool unearthed in @entity8 suggests @entity0 understood how to use bones to make useful devices			1
this skill was previously attributed to our species , @entity13 , and casts a new light on evolution 250,000 to 28,000 years ago			1
evidence of meat butchering and bone fracturing to extract marrow are evident on the tool			2
@entity21 ( shown in the green boxes ) suggest the use of the bone fragment for carved sharpening the cutting edges of stone tools ' this is the first time a multi-purpose bone tool from this period has been discovered , ' said @entity30 from the @entity31			1
' it was long thought that before @entity13 , other species did not have the cognitive ability to produce this type of artefact			1
' this discovery reduces the presumed gap between the two species and prevents us from saying that one was technically superior to the other			1
' the production of bone tools by @entity0 is open to debate			1
for much of the twentieth century , scientists were reluctant to recognise the ability of this species to use materials like bone in this way			2
for much of the twentieth century , scientists were reluctant to recognise the ability of this species to use materials like bone in this way			2
pictured is a reconstruction of the @entity0 environment however , over the past two decades , a numbers of discoveries have indicated the use of hard materials from animals by @entity0			2
' our discovery is an additional indicator of bone work by @entity0 and helps put into question the linear view of the evolution of human behaviour , ' professor @entity30 said			1
the tool was uncovered during annual digs at the @entity73 at @entity74 in @entity75 , @entity8			1
extremely well preserved , the tool comes from the left femur of an adult reindeer and its age is estimated between 55,000 and 60,000 years old			2
using bones to make tools was not the primary motivation for @entity0 hunting			1
above all , scientists believe they hunted to obtain the rich energy provided by meat and marrow			0
evidence of meat butchering and bone fracturing to extract marrow are seen on the tool			0
the tool , made from reindeer bone was found at the @entity73 at @entity74 in @entity75 , @entity8 other marks suggest the use of the bone fragment for sharpening the cutting edges of stone tools			1
@entity100 and a significant polish show the use of the bone as a scraper , according to the study			0
' the presence of this tool at a context where stone tools are abundant suggests an opportunistic choice of the bone fragment and its intentional modification into a tool by @entity0 , ' professor @entity30 said			1
separate research by @entity115 last year also found @entity0 were anything but the incompetent species that they are often deemed			1
the researchers pointed to evidence of complex hunting methods that required a group effort and planning in advance			0
the researchers arrived at their conclusions by conducting a series of experiments in teaching students the art of ' @entity131 stone - knapping '			0
this is when butchering ' flakes ' are created by hammering a hard rock against certain volcanic or glassy rocks , like basalt or flint the first conversation between our ancestors was about @entity142 and likely took place between 2.5 to 1.8 million years ago			0
this is according to an international study which found stone tool - making drove the evolution of language among our human ancestors in the @entity152 savannah			0
it suggests communication among our earliest ancestors may have been more complex than previously thought , and that tool - making helped drive evolution			2
the researchers , who included scientists at the @entity159 and @entity160 , arrived at their conclusions by conducting a series of experiments in teaching students the art of ' @entity131 stone - knapping '			0
this is when butchering ' flakes ' are created by hammering a hard rock against certain volcanic or glassy rocks , like basalt or flint			0
@entity131 stone - knapping dates back to the @entity172 period in eastern @entity152 , and remained largely unchanged for 700,000 years until more sophisticated @entity174 hand - axes and cleavers were developed			0
in testing five different ways to convey @entity131 stone - knapping skills to more than 180 college students , the researchers found that the demonstration that used spoken communication – versus imitation , non-verbal presentations or gestures – yielded the highest volume and quality of flakes .			0

the tool , made from reindeer bone , was unearthed in @entity75 , @entity8
it suggests @entity0 knew how to use bones to make useful devices
this skill was previously only attributed to our species , @entity13
this ' reduces the gap between the two species and prevents us from saying that one was technically superior to the other ' , said professor @entity30
