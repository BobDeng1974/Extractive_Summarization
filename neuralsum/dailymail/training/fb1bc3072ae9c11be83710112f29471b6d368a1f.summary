she piled on the pounds and ended up looking like a barrel on four legs as her owners misguidedly stuffed the former rescue dogs with treats			1
in fact , the only thing that would make her spring into action was the prospect of more food - and when not asleep , begging for more was about as active as she got			2
yesterday the trimmed down terrier was named winner of the @entity34 award			1
at her heaviest , she tipped the scales at 1stone 6lbs , making her morbidly obese , before going on a diet and fitness regime run by charity @entity39			0

' @entity2 not only gobbled up the treats , but also became a scavenger			1
on one occasion she made herself ill by stealing a ' phall ' chicken curry from the kitchen bin which mr @entity76 had thrown away - because it was too hot for him to eat			0
mrs @entity46 , who has health problems and is cared for by her husband , said : ' winning the competition is wonderful , but the real prize is seeing @entity2 enjoying a new lease of life tearing around the garden and playing with her toys			1
