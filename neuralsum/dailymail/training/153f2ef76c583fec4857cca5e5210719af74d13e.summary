have you noticed @entity1 and @entity2 sounding slightly high - pitched in reruns of friends episodes ? if so , it could be because your tv network is speeding up these classic shows to squeeze in a few more seconds of advertising time			1
the sneaky tactic has been highlighted in a @entity11 clip which shows the speed difference between an original copy of a @entity15 episode and a recent @entity17 rerun			1
the technology analyses both the video and audio programs and drops segments of video and audio which contain identical or ' like ' information to that of the neighboring segment			2

other methods of time reduction work by playing a pre-recorded program from a tape machine faster than normal speed			2
these methods have the adverse effect of altering the audio 's pitch and requires pitch - correction technology to prevent people from sounding like chipmunks			1

and it is n't the first time tv networks have tried to shorten reruns			2
similar techniques include cutting the opening sequence , speeding up the closing sequence and overlapping the next show			2

the technology analyses both the video and audio programs and drops segments of video and audio which contain identical or ' like ' information to that of the neighboring segment			2
' this method is unlike anything available in the market today , the company claims			0
' by design , this process does not affect the pitch of the audio			0
other methods of time reduction work by playing a pre-recorded program from a tape machine faster than normal speed			2
' that method has the adverse effect of altering the audio 's pitch and requires pitch - correction technology to prevent people from sounding like chipmunks			1
but the trick could ultimately back fire , experts claim			0
' it is important for us to consider the effect this is having on the viewer experience , ' @entity121 , executive vice president and director of video at @entity124 told @entity73 @entity130 averaged 18 minutes and 39 seconds of commercial time per - hour in prime time , which is up three minutes from december 2013 , according to an analysis by @entity134			1

for years , there have been rumours of @entity150 launching a tv - with @entity152 even famously telling his biographer the firm had ' cracked ' the problem			0
however , now it appears the firm 's plans may finally begin to be seen outside the company 's super secret @entity160 labs			0
it is believed to be talking to tv programmers about a streaming service that could rival @entity165			0
it say the service would put together bundles of programming , rather than entire tv lineups			0
instead , it could offer its own system , possibly with new ways to interact , with its own interface and user experience			0
@entity150 has shown programmers demos of the proposed service , sources told re / code			0
' but talks seem to be in the early stages , which means terms like pricing and timing are n't close to being ironed out			0
' the @entity135 , meanwhile , had 18 minutes and 42 seconds of ad time , up two minutes from the previous year			0

friends co-creator @entity198 is believed to have described the practice as ' wrong ' , claiming that her work has been manipulated to appear in a way that she had not intended			1
