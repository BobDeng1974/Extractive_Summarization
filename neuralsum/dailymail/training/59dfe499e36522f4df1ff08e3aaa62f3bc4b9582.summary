tv presenter @entity0 has been forced to apologise over jokes about @entity3 football fans			1
@entity0 , whose mother is @entity5 , blundered during @entity7 's coverage of @entity9 's 4 - 1 win over @entity10 when discussing the next @entity12 qualifying match at @entity13 against @entity3			1
speaking at the end of the match , @entity0 said : ' it ’s practically a home game for @entity3 – 15,000 @entity3 will be in here , i ’m sure			1
' to which @entity0 said : ' i ’m trying to get some building work done at the moment , quite seriously			1
' in a statement , @entity0 said : ' i made the remark in relation to the nice @entity3 builders currently working at my place , who i knew would already be fed up having watched their team lose to @entity43			1
' no offence was intended - apart from anything else i could hardly be prouder of my own @entity47 background			0
' but to anyone who thought what i said constituted some kind of lazy stereotyping , and was offended by it , i certainly apologise			0
' quip : @entity0 told his guests during the show that @entity9 's games at @entity13 was ' practically a home game for @entity3 - 15,000 @entity3 will be in here i 'm sure ' his remarks had been greeted with smiles and laughter from guests @entity27 , @entity62 and @entity9 forward @entity63 and former @entity65 star @entity64			1
but the quips sparked outrage on social media sites , with hundreds of tweets and a number of people calling for him to be sacked for racial stereotyping			0
one tweeter , @entity74 , said : ' i was very disappointed by @entity0 ' comments tonight , thought they were inappropriate			2
no place for casual racism on tv			0
another , @entity81 , posted : ' @ itvfootball @entity0 ' comments tonight on the @entity3 were disgraceful			1
what are you going to do about it ? ! ' studio guests : @entity64 , @entity63 and @entity27 gave their post-match verdicts after the @entity10 game when @entity0 made his jokes many of the tweets were more abusive towards the presenter , who was a trending subject on the social media site after the match			1
this is not the first time the presenter , who has been with @entity98 since 2010 , has made a comment about @entity3 people in the @entity101			2
after the 1 - 1 draw with the @entity103 in may he commented that when @entity3 visited @entity13 it would ' be like a home game ' for them			2
@entity0 is no stranger to controversy , the @entity108 supporter called former @entity108 player @entity110 a ' t * * t ' at the club 's awards evening at the end of last season - he later rang the player to apologise			2
police expect a quarter of the 90,000 crowd will be cheering @entity3 when they meet @entity9 at @entity13 in the vital @entity12 qualifying game on tuesday			2
in addition to the country ’s official allocation , a huge number of @entity101 - based @entity3 have snapped up tickets			0
a @entity125 spokesman said the force was ‘ not overly concerned ’ about the large number of away fans , despite the potential for violence			0
@entity9 head into the final set of fixtures leading @entity134 by a point			0
they must win the game to qualify automatically for next year ’s finals in @entity139			0
the alternative is that they will face the hazardous play - offs as any other result would mean relying on winless @entity144 to take points from @entity43 , who are second in in the group .			0

pundit @entity27 said he hoped 15,000 @entity3 would be ' crying ' if @entity9 beat them , to which @entity0 responded : ' i 'm trying to get some building work done at the moment , be careful '
@entity0 , whose mother is @entity5 , says he meant no offence
