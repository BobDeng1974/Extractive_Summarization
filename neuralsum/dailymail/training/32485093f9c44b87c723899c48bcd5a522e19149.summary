but a zoo in @entity7 allows visitors to get up close and personal with some of the most dangerous animals in the world			2
and if these pictures are anything to go by , visitors at @entity12 are not only able to cuddle a tiger , rub noses with a lion and hand - feed a bear - they are also able to walk away at the end of it to tell the tale			2
up close : a visitor gives a tame - looking lion a quick peck on his nose tame ? this tiger seems to be enjoying itself as a visitor rubs its belly feeding time : the zoo received this brown bear , which appears to be eating something directly out of a visitor 's mouth , when it was two months old since it opened in 1994 , there have been no reports of attacks , according to @entity40 , although there is some debate as to exactly why that is			1
while some visitors claim the animals must be drugged , the zoo says the animals ' tameness comes from raising each cub from birth and teaching them to be calm and uninterested in eating people			1
the zoo claims keeping the animals constantly fed helps to keep them calm and passive , along with the training given			1
lions were among some of the animals at the zoo when it opened , along with a monkey , two donkeys , two ponies , llama , deer and peacocks			0
friendly : some visitors claim the animals are drugged , but the zoo puts their tameness down to training and keeping them fed safe ? there have reportedly been no attacks at the zoo since it opened in 1994 as well as bears , tigers and lions the zoo holds two female elephants , a wide variety of reptiles and birds			1
many of the animals at the zoo are said to be former illegal house pets , offered to the zoo after they have outgrown their homes			0
according to the zoo 's website , it currently holds more than 50 african lions , 20 bengal tigers , 12 mountain lions and about 50 different species of @entity94 monkeys			0
child 's play ? a child is left to play alongside lion cubs at the zoo attraction : along with bears , tigers and lions the zoo features two female elephants , a wide variety of reptiles and birds			0
