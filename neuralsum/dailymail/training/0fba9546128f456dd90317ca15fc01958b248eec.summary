under a full moon in the @entity2 , @entity0 was entitled to howl with elation as the @entity4 did what their manager does on match day – they came alive			1
no one responded greater to @entity0 ’s demand for an extra 10 per cent than @entity11 whose two - goal contribution was the act of deliverance he has long threatened to provide in an @entity16 jersey			1
on his 70th appearance , @entity11 struck with a glorious 90th minute match - winner , engineered and executed by his twinkling toes and rising self - belief			1
stunner : @entity4 winger @entity11 ( right ) bends the ball into the top corner in the 90th minute to secure victory for his country centre of attention : @entity11 runs off to celebrate his decisive goal with his team - mates just three minutes before the final whistle mobbed : @entity11 is hugged by team - mate @entity31 as he celebrates scoring the winner in front of the @entity4 's travelling supporters back of the net : @entity11 ( right ) strikes to put @entity0 's men into the lead against @entity38 at the @entity40 @entity39 perfect start : @entity42 midfielder @entity11 runs off to celebrate his goal after being set - up by club team - mate @entity44 in the 23rd minute @entity38 : @entity46 ( @entity47 45 ) , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 ( @entity56 63 ) , @entity57 ( @entity58 88 ) , @entity59			1
subs not used : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69			0
goals : @entity71 booked : @entity51 , @entity72 , @entity73 rep of @entity4 : @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity31 , @entity44 ( @entity78 91 ) , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 ( long 76 ) , @entity11 , @entity82 ( @entity83 76 )			1
subs not used : @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , given			0
goals : @entity11 23 , 90 booked : @entity94 referee : @entity96 ( @entity97 ) no one goes back longer with @entity0 than @entity11 and it was fitting the @entity100 should ensure a winning @entity102 start for his former @entity104 manager			2
confronted by a wall of white as he gathered possession on the edge of the box , @entity11 ’s shoulder dip sent half the @entity38 defence into the nearby @entity111 , and created sufficient space to curl a lovely left footer into the far corner			2
on the touchline , @entity0 soared skywards , beside him @entity81 and @entity116 , who had been substituted , were wrapped in each other arms			0
in the colourful history of @entity16 football , it ’s a rare event for the senior team to score a last - gasp winner , especially on foreign turf			0
this win , hard - earned but deserved , was sweet and it sets the @entity16 up for a six - point start to @entity127 – they play @entity129 next – before the trip to @entity131 on october 14			0
predictably , the @entity38 were gung - ho early on , eager to remind the @entity16 what they missed six years ago when the @entity135 qualifier was shifted to neutral @entity136			0
but their early fizz could n’t mask their limitations and @entity4 , all verve and vigour , controlled most of the play			2
as the @entity38 perhaps scented a weakness , they lowered their guard and were caught squarely on the chin in the 24rd minute as @entity11 made his first telling input			2
from @entity74 ’s deep clearance , @entity80 headed down to @entity81 who allowed the ball run into the path of @entity44			0
the option to shoot was there but @entity44 , aware @entity11 was up in support to the left , deftly he laid the ball off for his @entity42 comrade to slip the ball calmly under @entity46			1
on the bench , @entity0 and @entity81 sprang to their feet , the tensions uncoiled and they embraced			0
the goal should have been the cue for @entity4 to kick on and consolidate			2
on the run : @entity4 defender @entity31 ( right ) takes on @entity38 's @entity164 during the first half in @entity166 passionate support : @entity4 fans get behind their country in their first @entity102 qualifying match battle : two - goal hero @entity11 ( right ) tussles with @entity38 's @entity173 ( left ) as he bids to get a cross into the penalty area but seven minutes before half - time , their jaws dropped as @entity38 conjured up an improbable equaliser from the right - foot of @entity181			1
the second half unfolded as predicted with @entity11 at the hub of @entity4 ’s most creative efforts			1
he curled a free - kick a whisker wide , went close with a right - stinging right - footer and worked the substitute ‘ keeper , @entity47 as he peppered in crosses			0
for the final 15 minutes , @entity190 pressed for a winner as @entity38 bedded down to for a draw which seemed likely until @entity75 found @entity11 and the wee man ’s magic did the rest			1
driving force : right back @entity75 ( right ) takes the ball past @entity38 's @entity198 on sunday evening doubling up : @entity80 ( left ) and @entity82 ( right ) make sure @entity38 's @entity51 ( back ) ca n't get control of the ball			0

@entity4 earn three points with 90th minute goal in @entity166
@entity42 winger @entity11 opened the scoring in the 23rd minute
but @entity71 levelled for the hosts with a deflected effort seven minutes before the break
@entity212 looked to be heading for a draw before @entity11 *grabbed* his second goal of the game late on
