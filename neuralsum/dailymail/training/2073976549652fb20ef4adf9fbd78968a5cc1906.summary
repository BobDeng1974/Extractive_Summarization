by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 last updated at 12:11 am on 24th november 2011 @entity3 was facing an inquiry last night after it was revealed his girlfriend touted for work boasting she had access to cabinet ministers			2
@entity9 contacted top lobbying companies in @entity11 suggesting she could get their clients in front of senior members of the @entity15			1
in an extraordinary email , which she appears to have sent with her cv to most of the major public relations companies in @entity11 , the 45 - year - old former journalist and pr consultant said she had ‘ excellent contacts … from @entity23 members to more junior ministers ’			1
political circuit : @entity3 mp and @entity9 share a drink at the @entity28 the email , also sent in letter form , urges them to ‘ make use of my skills and contacts ’			1
a senior @entity37 source said : ‘ i ’ve seen her letter and i believe she has sent it to all of us			2
’ @entity3 energy secretary mr @entity3 has denied any wrongdoing			0
his spokesman said : ‘ there is no question of a conflict of interest as @entity3 understands @entity9 does not intend to accept any work that touches on his departmental responsibilities			1
’ but a senior @entity3 source last night conceded it was ‘ not sensible ’ for miss @entity9 to have sent out the email			1
@entity55 mp @entity54 wrote to the prime minister to demand an investigation into whether the ministerial code had been breached			0
he said : ‘ this is completely shameless			0
it is entirely wrong that she should be hawking around her contacts with her cabinet minister boyfriend and his pals			2
’ the ministerial code states that ministers are responsible for ensuring that ‘ no conflict arises , or could reasonably be perceived to arise , between their public duties and their private interests , financial or otherwise ’			2
in his letter mr @entity54 says : ‘ if these allegations are true it suggests a very worrying situation if relatives , partners or others closely connected with cabinet ministers are offering their contacts to the highest bidder			1
’ miss @entity9 last night defended her actions , saying : ‘ as a former political journalist for 12 years , i have many friends and acquaintances in all parties			1
‘ i have worked in communications and public relations , including with the @entity3			0
obviously in any role i take , it will not involve energy and climate change and there will be no conflict of interest			0
’ mr @entity3 is already facing a criminal investigation into claims by his ex-wife @entity97 who has alleged he persuaded her to take his penalty points for a speeding offence			0
political partner : miss @entity9 at this year 's @entity3 annual conference he left his wife for @entity104 last year after 26 years of marriage as their affair came to light			1
miss @entity9 , who has previously worked as mr @entity3 ’s press officer , accompanied him to this year ’s @entity3 conference			1
@entity55 mp @entity111 , who led criticism against defence secretary dr @entity113 before he was forced to resign last month over the way he allowed his friend @entity115 to tag along to meetings , branded government links to the lobbying industry as ‘ incestuous ’			0
he said : ‘ it is no good for @entity3 ’s partner to say she wo n’t lobby on a particular issue because of his ministerial responsibility because in government that can change			0
‘ it puts @entity3 in an impossible position			0
it is not in the interests of a cabinet minister for his partner , or any family member , to be working in the lobbying industry			0
it absolutely should not happen			0
miss @entity9 ’s attempts to find work have highlighted a loophole in the rules			1
when miss @entity97 left her job at the @entity140 to take up a position with @entity143 financial firm @entity142 , the move had to be vetted by the @entity144			0
as a former senior civil servant she was barred from lobbying members of the government for a year			2
but miss @entity9 does not have to have any future position approved .			1

@entity9 told company she had ' excellent contacts *...* from @entity23 members to more junior ministers '
