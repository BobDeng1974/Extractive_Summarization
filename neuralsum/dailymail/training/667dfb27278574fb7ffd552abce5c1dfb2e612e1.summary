nurses rushed to prepare emergency care and alerted the crash team before one gave the newborn oxygen			0
@entity10 eventually returned to the children 's ward after being stabilised but has since been plagued by falling oxygen levels and poor breathing			2
@entity10 , pictured , stopped breathing after he was sedated in hospital for an mri scan he is now receiving antibiotics for a slight chest infection and is being closely monitored in an oxygen - filled incubator in the neonatal ward			2
