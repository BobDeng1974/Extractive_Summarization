a message posted on @entity1 by @entity2 claiming that president @entity3 denied them backup as forces overran @entity6 was taken down twice by the social networking site			1
the move has stoked accusations that @entity1 was censoring the @entity11 ’ message to ‘ quietly squelch opposition ’ to president @entity3 ’s alleged failures			1
the message contained in a meme suggesting that @entity3 relied on the seals when he wanted to get @entity17 , but then turned round and denied them back up when they called for it in @entity6			1
censored ? the @entity23 post was taken down by @entity1 twice ... but not before it had been shared online by thousands @entity26 ambassador to @entity28 @entity27 and three other @entity26 embassy staff were killed in the attack by @entity32 militants in @entity6 , @entity28 on september 11			2
the tragedy has become a controversial issue in next month 's presidential election due to ongoing confusion over how much the administration knew about the circumstances of the attack			1
sources present during the deadly six - hour assault have said that a desperate last request for military assistance once the @entity43 themselves came under attack was denied , even though elite counter-terrorism units were only two hours away			2
the @entity1 message about the attack was posted by @entity47 ( @entity23 ) , an organisation founded by @entity49 veterans dedicated to protecting forces at home and abroad			1
attack : the @entity26 @entity53 in @entity6 is seen in flames during fierce clashes in which @entity26 ambassador @entity27 died the image was shared on @entity1 between 30,000 users within 24 hours of it being posted online			2
however it was taken down at the weekend for what sos claims was an ‘ unspecified violation of @entity1 ’s terms of @entity63			2
’ retired @entity65 captain @entity64 said : ‘ it looks like @entity3 ’s liberal followers in @entity68 are terrified of how damaging the @entity6 scandal is for the president			1
' we understand that @entity1 can run their site however they ’d like , but when they ’re trying to quietly squelch opposition to what is a clear leadership failure that resulted in the tragic deaths of some of our nation ’s heroes , they deserve the to be called out on it			1
’ tragedy : walls at the main entrance of the @entity26 consulate in @entity6 , apparently stained with blood colonel @entity87 , retired from the @entity88 , added : ‘ @entity26 across the country deserve the truth about what happened in @entity28 , and they certainly deserve to know when people who hold the keys to a lot of their online communications are trying to keep that from them			0
’ after the post was removed twice and @entity23 ’s @entity1 account suspended for 24 hours , the post was reinstated and @entity23 received an email from @entity1 apologising			0
it said : ‘ a member of our team accidentally removed something you posted on @entity1			0
this was mistake , and we sincerely apologize for this error			0
we 've since restored the content , and you should now be able to see it			0
’ @entity23 responded to the apology : ‘ we accept their apology but do not accept that it was an innocent mistake			0
it was clearly a means to protect @entity3 on @entity28			1
’ a spokesperson from @entity1 said : ' this was an error and we apologize for any inconvenience it may have caused			0
they can feel free to repost the image			0
