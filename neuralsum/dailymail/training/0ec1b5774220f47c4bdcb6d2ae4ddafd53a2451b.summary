click here to see more from our brilliant @entity2 service - including this heat map from @entity5 if @entity6 are to go on and achieve something significant here over the next two weeks then one moment from this extraordinary afternoon in north - east @entity10 will be frozen in time			1
the image — shown afterwards by the host broadcaster here — is of @entity5 , caught mid-strike , head and knee perfectly over the ball , as he catches an 88th - minute volley flush on the sweet spot of his right boot			1
it shows a world - class sportsman — no doubt exhausted after an hour - and - a - half of play in extreme conditions — in perfect control of his body , all outside pressures and influences rendered irrelevant by concentration and calm			2
a moment that saved @entity6 from expulsion , it would have been ruined had @entity5 shown anything other than the most remarkable assurance			1
@entity36 , of all the people here , knew he was going to score			2
class : @entity40 gives the corner flag a karate kick after his winning goal winner : @entity40 celebrates scoring the dramatic and controversial late goal for the @entity46 flashpoint : @entity49 skipper @entity48 ( left ) fouls @entity50 inside the penalty box in the 93rd minute level : @entity5 scored in the 88th minute to drag @entity6 bag into the game drama : @entity5 pulled the @entity46 back into the game with this strike in the 88th minute heartbreak : the @entity49 players look distraught after the last minute defeat jubilant : @entity60 celebrates giving @entity49 a 1 - 0 lead after 48 minutes gap : @entity63 ( left ) and @entity64 fail to stop the shot from @entity66 @entity68 madness : @entity49 's head coach @entity69 celebrates after his side take a deserved lead @entity6 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : @entity72 6 ; @entity73 5.5 , @entity74 5.5 , @entity75 5.5 ; @entity78 7.5 , @entity77 6 ( @entity76 56mins 6 ) , @entity79 5 ( @entity80 10mins 6 ) , @entity64 6 , @entity5 6 @entity50 7 , @entity81 5 ( @entity40 75mins 6.5 ) subs not used : @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91			1
goals : @entity5 87 ' , @entity40 90 ' @entity49 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity93 8 ; @entity94 6.5 , @entity48 7 , @entity95 6.5 ( @entity96 45mins 6.5 ) ; @entity97 7 , @entity98 7 , @entity99 6.5 , @entity69 7 , @entity100 7 ; @entity66 7.5 ( @entity101 60mins 6.5 ) , @entity102 6 ( @entity103 74mins 6 ) subs not used : @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112			1
bookings : @entity97 , @entity100 goals : @entity66 48 ' @entity115 : @entity93 referee : @entity117 att : 58,817 * @entity119 ratings by @entity120 at the @entity121 elsewhere , they will maybe talk about other things			2
the @entity68 will want to talk about the penalty that subsequently won @entity6 the game			1
@entity126 seemed very keen afterwards to talk about his own tactical expertise			0
more of that when he comes to @entity129 and we will all be asleep			0
this , though , was a match rescued by a moment of perfection			0
the heroic @entity49 goalkeeper @entity93 — sadly now on his way home — hardly saw @entity5 ’s shot			1
it flew past him like a missile			0
when he watches it again on tv , maybe he will shrug			0
the great players , no matter how poorly they are playing , produce great moments when it matters			0
and @entity5 had played badly			1
he is past his best			0
@entity147 2010 was his time			0
as @entity6 rallied , he was outshone by @entity50 and , as strange as it sounds , @entity78			1
if you have a player like @entity5 , though , you keep him on and you wait			1
‘ i have seen him deliver that type of shot so many times in the last two years , ’ said @entity152 afterwards			0
‘ he is also one of the fittest players in the squad			0
’ everybody had to be fit			0
it was 38 degrees on the field			0
in the stands , you needed leather skin			0
either that or a big hat			0
as it was , many of the supporters unfortunate enough to be seated in the sun retreated to the shade at the rear			0
the heat affected the game but did not reduce the drama			0
dip : @entity176 ( centre ) and @entity50 ( right ) react after @entity49 # s first goal dangerous : @entity66 goes close with another strike in the second half @entity60 gave @entity49 a deserved 1 - 0 with his 48th minute strike - click here to find out more from our brilliant @entity2 service finish : @entity60 gave @entity49 the lead in the 48th minute with a brilliant strike off it : @entity81 struggled to make an impact in @entity188 and was substituted in the second half @entity189 allowed the teams a water break in each half			1
@entity152 admitted he used the second one like an @entity195 time - out to change his tactics and drill new instructions into the brains of his weary players			2
prior to the @entity49 goal , @entity6 had been desperately poor			1
a five - man defence that attracts criticism in @entity6 often resembled an orange wall of seven as holding midfield players retreated into the backline whenever @entity49 had the ball			1
all it did for an hour was invite @entity49 to attack , and they did			2
the @entity210 could and should have scored in the first half			0
@entity98 twice threatened from distance and @entity213 had a great sight of goal in the 17th minute			2
@entity6 , deprived of the injured @entity216 after only 10 minutes , created one chance that @entity176 wasted with a poor touch and should have been given a penalty when @entity50 was fouled by @entity48 and @entity95 in the 44th minute			1
@entity152 ’s team needed to improve but it did n’t happen until after @entity49 had scored			2
it was a fine strike , the terrific @entity60 firing past @entity72 from 25 yards with his left foot			2
video @entity46 party rumbles on crucial : @entity50 ( left ) was fouled in the final moments to win his side the penalty listen : @entity126 ( right ) gives some instructions to @entity228 foul ? @entity6 could have been given a penalty after this @entity95 tackle of @entity50 battle : @entity99 challenges @entity81 for the ball during the first 45 minutes injury : @entity95 is helped by the @entity68 medical staff during the first half certainly , it was question time for @entity6 and , to their credit , they responded			1
@entity50 carried the biggest threat and @entity78 was unstinting , playing left wing back , right back and centre forward in @entity152 ’s reshuffles			2
chances did come but the @entity46 could n’t take them and when @entity93 somehow saved a point - blank volley from @entity249 on the hour , it was tempting to wonder if it just was n’t @entity6 ’s day			1
@entity5 saw a shot deflected narrowly over after @entity50 had set him up and the @entity253 winger appealed again for a penalty with 22 minutes to go			1
this time he looked as though he had dived			0
@entity255 : @entity48 ( left ) gestures after the referee points to the penalty spot ouch : @entity213 ( centre ) is kicked in the head by @entity261 's @entity74 ( right ) brave : @entity69 managed to come away from this challenge without a serious injury hot : @entity49 take on fluids during a cooling break with the temperature close to 40 degrees @entity93 then saved with his knee at the near post from @entity50 and defender @entity74 headed over from the resulting corner			1
soon after @entity81 was hauled off and replaced by @entity40			2
that was to prove vital			0
first , though , @entity6 had to equalise and @entity5 seized his moment when @entity50 floated a corner to the far post and @entity276 backpedalled to cleverly head down towards the space his team - mate had found			1
needle : @entity66 ( left ) and @entity228 argue after a tackle from the @entity46 duel : @entity100 ( left ) and @entity64 battle for the ball in the heat of @entity188 down : @entity50 is tackled by @entity95 during the first half at the @entity121 back in the game , @entity6 looked set for extra-time			1
some physical challenge that would have been.as it was , controversy arrived			0
@entity50 escaped to the byline and fell over @entity48 ’s foot			2
a dive or a foul ? perhaps it was a bit of both and @entity40 stepped up to win this knockout tie with a swish of his right foot			1
it was the moment that won an incredible game			0
it was n’t , though , the one for which it should be remembered			0
well done : @entity152 congratulates the winning goal scorer after the final whistle unlucky : @entity93 put in another brilliant performance but was on the losing side @entity308 : the @entity46 players celebrate at the final whistle with the @entity68 left heartbroken double @entity46 : the substitute striker is mobbed after sending his team into the quarter - finals last minute : @entity40 wheels away in celebration after putting his penalty away through : @entity6 goalkeepr @entity72 hits the floor in celebration of his team - mate 's goal			1

@entity40 - @entity322 scores winning goal from penalty spot to put @entity6 into @entity326 quarter - finals
@entity60 do @entity60 had given @entity49 the lead in the 48th minute
@entity5 levelled for the @entity46 in the closing minutes
@entity50 takes controversial fall to win 93rd minute penalty
