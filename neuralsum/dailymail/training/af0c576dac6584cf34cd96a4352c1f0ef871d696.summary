@entity0 - fingered : prince @entity1 has allowed the clippings from yew hedges at his @entity4 to be turned into cancer - fighting drugs he is well known for his love of homeopathy and natural health cures			1
now prince @entity1 is allowing the clippings from yew hedges in his beloved gardens at @entity4 to be turned into cancer - fighting drugs			1
this year 820lbs of cuttings from the common @entity15 yews that line large parts of his @entity18 estate are being turned into treatments for breast , ovarian , lung and @entity25 - related cancers			1
the innovative scheme is the brainchild of a small @entity29 - based company , @entity28 , which has been harvesting hedge clippings for use in cancer treatments for more than 20 years			1
over 4,000 public and private gardens take part in the scheme – and now @entity4 has been added to the list , with some cuttings made by the gardening prince ’s own fair hand			1
according to one royal aide , the prince loves order and structure in his gardens and has planted dozens of yews in the world - famous grounds of his private country home , particularly in the @entity49 and @entity50 areas			2
many of these have been made in topiaries , leading to a lot of waste which is normally made into compost			1
this year , however , @entity1 has given permission for the clippings from the hedges to be used in the treatment of cancer			1
certain species of yews – including those at @entity4 - contain cancer fighting molecules known as taxanes in the tips of their branches			1
these molecules work as what is known as an ‘ anti-mitotic ’ and prevents cells from multiplying , halting the growth of those infected with cancer			2
they also effectively prevent blood vessels supporting cancer cell growth			2
the clippings can only be harvested at a certain time each year – from june to september – when yews are producing their new year growth			0
this year 820lbs of cuttings from the common @entity15 yews that line large parts of his estate in @entity88 , @entity18 , are being used for cancer drugs outside of this period , the vital chemical extracts found within yew hedges are significantly reduced as the stems become too ‘ woody ’			1
once collected , the clippings are stabilised through drying at the @entity95 ’s barn in @entity96 before being sent to @entity15 , where they are ground by drugs companies into powder and extraction of the compound takes place			1
a ‘ carrier fluid ’ is used to dilute the dosage to enable intravenous delivery for cancer patients			0
the molecules are incorporated into a number of well - known drugs used to treat both @entity111 patients and sufferers around the world			0
as yew hedge clippings are not easily compostable , contain toxins and are not environmentally friendly to burn , the ‘ recycling ’ of them into anti-cancer drugs is also considered an eco-friendly method to make use of an otherwise unpleasant garden waste			1
limehurst , the company used by the heir to throne , pays for the clippings and @entity1 has donated the ‘ few hundred pounds ’ he has received from them to a local hospice , sources confirmed			1
since it started the initiative , the firm has recycled 5,500 tonnes of yew clippings			1
it also donates unwanted fees to the cancer charity @entity135			0
a @entity137 spokesman told the @entity138 this week : ‘ using the yew hedge clippings is something we have done in the past and , after a break , we are starting to do it again			2
‘ the clipping are bought from the estate and the @entity1 has donated the money he has received to a local hospice			2
it is clearly a very worthwhile initiative			0
’ @entity152 ’s oldest tree , an ancient pagan symbol of life and longevity , has long been known for its ‘ life - saving ’ properties			0
@entity157 is from the @entity159 family and it ’s botanical name taxus baccata			0
it is reasonably hardy and grows on any soil , although it prefers chalk and limestone			0
@entity157 was the preferred wood for making medieval longbows because of its flexibility			0
it was also one of the seven sacred trees in @entity174 tradition and was used by the @entity175 for prophecy			0
it is widely believed that early @entity178 adopted ancient sacred sites for their churches , hence the proliferation of yew trees in churchyards			0
its toxic properties were also believed to ward off sheep from the graveyards			0
in @entity189 it has been used to treat diabetes and induce abortions			0
native @entity192 in the @entity194 also used a yew brew to treat rheumatism , fever and arthritis			0
now these molecules are being harvested by modern scientists in the fight against breast and ovarian cancer , with generally excellent results .			2
