@entity0 left the @entity1 reeling yesterday as a provocative carve - up of his cabinet signalled a shift to the @entity5 on law and order , the environment and @entity9			1
right - winger @entity10 was appointed to @entity11 as veteran @entity12 , dubbed the ' sixth @entity1 cabinet minister in the @entity14 ' , was demoted			1
@entity15 , who has dismissed wind farms as a waste of money , became environment secretary			1
in the biggest shock , culture secretary @entity20 was promoted to @entity22 as @entity23 paid the price for controversy over the government 's @entity27 reforms			2
right - winger @entity10 , left , was appointed to @entity11 as veteran @entity12 , right enjoy some shut eye at the @entity30 , dubbed the ' sixth @entity31 cabinet minister in the @entity14 ' , was demoted clean start : a road sweeper cleans @entity34 ahead of the arrival of @entity0 's ministers prime minister - @entity0 deputy prime minister - @entity38 foreign - @entity39 chancellor - @entity40 chief secretary to the treasury - @entity41 justice - @entity10 home secretary - @entity43 defence - @entity44 business , innovation and skills - @entity48 work and @entity50 - @entity49 @entity52 - @entity51 health - @entity20 education - @entity54 @entity55 - @entity56 transport - @entity57 @entity58 - @entity15 international development - @entity60 culture secretary - @entity61 @entity62 - @entity63 @entity65 - @entity64 @entity67 - @entity66 minister without portfolio - @entity12 minister without portfolio - @entity69 @entity72 - lord @entity71 @entity73 - @entity23 cabinet minister - @entity74 solicitor general – @entity76 chief whip - @entity77 both @entity1 and @entity79 mps who oppose a third runway at @entity82 , along with @entity83 , expressed alarm as transport secretary @entity60 , an implacable opponent of expansion of the airport , was brutally sidelined and moved to @entity87			1
she was replaced after just ten months in the job by chief whip @entity90 , who was said to have ' no baggage ' over aviation			0
in another shock for the @entity1 , arch - thatcherite @entity93 , who has been a member of the prime minister 's inner circle as conservative deputy chairman , and chancellor @entity40 's close ally @entity97 were both sent to the @entity100 as ' counterweights ' to business secretary @entity48			1
mr @entity40 , who was booed by spectators at the @entity103 on monday night , was also seen to have been bruised by the reshuffle as former chancellor @entity12 was compensated for his demotion with a roaming brief – which will focus in part on the economy			1
and a proposed switch to justice for work and pensions secretary @entity49 , mooted by mr @entity40 's allies after the two men clashed over plans to cut more from the welfare budget , failed to come off			1
in an embarrassing blow to the prime minister 's authority , mr @entity49 flatly turned down the move			2
in what was dubbed a ' morning of the blunt knives ' , mr @entity0 dispatched only three members of his cabinet altogether : commons leader sir @entity122 , environment secretary @entity123 and welsh secretary @entity124 , who was said to have been in tears as she was sacked			1
the big beasts of the government – mr @entity40 , foreign secretary @entity39 and home secretary @entity43 – kept their jobs			2
but aides insisted the prime minister had cleared away what he regarded as ' roadblocks ' as the government entered an ' implementation phase '			2
asked about the negative @entity1 reaction to several of his appointments , one @entity79 source asked : ' who cares ? ' sacked : health secretary @entity23 lost his job today because of his controversial @entity27 reforms , which saw him heckled in the street by a protester a serious - looking @entity0 arrives at @entity34 ahead of his his first major @entity121 reshuffle , which saw @entity69 ( left ) become party chairman in other moves : fallen @entity1 star @entity147 , who resigned from the @entity121 days into the @entity14 over his expenses claims , returned as education minister ; disability minister @entity61 was the biggest female winner , propelled into the @entity121 as culture secretary and equalities minister ; housing minister @entity69 was made party chairman as @entity79 @entity153 got their wish and @entity155 was sacked and demoted ; @entity79 mp @entity156 , who has described opponents of planning reform as ' hysterical , scaremongering @entity159 ' , is to be made planning minister ; a clutch of new women mps , including @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 , won junior ministerial jobs to compensate for an embarrassing fall in the number of full women @entity121 members			1
@entity153 expressed deep unease at the @entity121 's shift to the @entity5 – with mr @entity10 's appointment causing particular dismay			2
the former shadow home secretary takes a far tougher stance on law and order than mr @entity12 , and as one of the government 's staunchest eurosceptics is likely to pick a fight with @entity184 over prisoners ' votes and human rights law			1
former @entity188 leader sir @entity188 said : ' the one @entity121 appointment which @entity1 will look at most carefully is that of @entity10			1
it often seems that @entity12 was speaking for the @entity1 as much as the government both in @entity192 and outside			1
' an aide to @entity38 insisted he was content with the changes – though he admitted mr @entity48 had not been consulted about the appointments to his department			0
@entity79 mp @entity197 said it appeared ' a more @entity79 government than we had before ... i think the party will be delighted			0
' in other changes , transport minister @entity63 became @entity204 and @entity66 was appointed @entity205			2
@entity40 faces war over cuts to welfare the newly named environment secretary @entity15 leaves no 10 , left , and incoming @entity62 secretary @entity63 in @entity209 @entity20 was the biggest winner in the reshuffle as he took charge of the @entity27 despite controversy over his links with @entity216 's media empire and controversial views on health			1
his promotion marks a spectacular turnaround in his political fortunes and could revive his ambitions to succeed mr @entity0 as @entity79 leader			0
a clearly delighted mr @entity20 said the appointment was the ' biggest honour ' of his life.paying the price for months of controversy last year over his reforms of the @entity229 , @entity23 was axed in an unexpected move by @entity0			0
though he had previously suggested he would not take any other government job , having been in charge of health policy for the @entity235 since 2004 , the health secretary accepted a demotion to the job of @entity238			0
culture secretary mr @entity20 was handed the post only a few months after his career was seen to be hanging by a thread over his contacts with @entity216 executives at time when he was considering the @entity247 takeover bid			2
@entity20 was the biggest winner in the reshuffle as he took charge of the @entity27 despite controversy over his links with @entity216 's media empire and controversial views on health @entity254 chief @entity253 was given a key @entity256 job in one of the biggest surprises of the reshuffle			0
the former investment banker with @entity260 has been appointed commercial secretary with responsibility for economic delivery and will take a seat in the @entity265			0
mr @entity253 , 56 , will officially take up the role in january when his contact with @entity268 ends and he will be doing the job unpaid			0
a move to @entity22 had been mooted before the controversy erupted , but was thought to have been killed off as the government awaits the verdict of the @entity274 into media standards , at which mr @entity20 received a tough grilling			0
@entity1 refused to back him in a @entity278 vote called by @entity279 on his future , in an episode regarded by mr @entity0 as a low point for @entity14 relations			1
but despite the cloud hanging over mr @entity20 as @entity285 prepares his report , the pm is understood to believe he has ' been through the mill ' and emerged stronger			0
the appointment comes despite potentially controversial views mr @entity20 holds on homeopathy and abortion			0
in 2007 , he signed an @entity278 motion backing the work of homeopathic hospitals			0
he voted to reduce the abortion time limit from 24 weeks to 12 weeks in 2008			0
and he co-authored a book with @entity79 mep @entity298 which suggested the @entity27 might need to be ' dismantled ' and claimed it was no longer ' relevant ' .			0
