first impressions of @entity1 for the @entity3 players when they touch down to begin their @entity5 adventure this summer will be favourable to say the least			1
overlooking the luxurious @entity6 is a stunning beach with swaying palm trees , crystal blue waters and an endless procession of bikini - clad girls sashaying across the sand			1
but should they , or any @entity3 supporters making the trip out to follow their team , head inland from the idyllic beachfront , they risk experiencing an altogether different and disturbing atmosphere			1
the stinking filth and squalor of the biggest shanty town in @entity24 spilling down the hillside less than half a mile away is now also synonymous with violence and multiple deaths , just weeks before the @entity5 comes to town			0
@entity29 : the @entity3 team 's @entity5 hotel will be overlooked by the fearsome @entity33 shanty town idyllic : while the view from @entity3 's plush hotel is the stuff of dreams , it 's a different experience inland ghetto : over 200,000 people live in the @entity33 favela and there a nightly gun fights between police and gangs hands up : an undercover female detective on patrol in the @entity33 as police tackle drug gangs patrol : heavily armed police officers monitor the favela to prevent the gangs from taking control the @entity33 favela is a place where crackling gunfire lights up the night sky , and where police death squads and drug gangs battle for control of the sewage - filled streets			1
there has been an orgy of extra-judicial killing by @entity69 ’s military police – the result of a government crackdown to ‘ pacify ’ the favelas before the world ’s media arrive			1
last week a popular local @entity75 was murdered by police just feet from @entity1 ’s famed @entity77 , leading to violent demonstrations			1
on monday nine buses were set on fire in protest at police brutality			2
seven police officers have died in clashes since the start of the year			2
@entity33 is a maze of haphazard steps carved into the hillside leading to a muddle of one - bedroom shanty homes made from breeze blocks where 200,000 deprived and desperate @entity1 citizens live			1
stalls sell live chickens next to dead ones and fly - covered fruit and veg			2
there is a ceaseless cacophony of motorcycle horns , loud music and yelling voices			0
inside every shack , no matter how tiny , families crowd around television screens			0
eighteen - year - old @entity106 is among them			1
his father was snatched by police who mistook him for a drug dealer , then killed him			1
violence : human rights activists have complained that the police have gone overboard to pacify the favelas the death last year of @entity117 , a 42 - year - old bricklayer , is now a cause @entity118 25 officers including the head of the favela ’s police force are standing trial			1
officers are said to have tasered , strangled and then drowned their victim during a 40 - minute torture session before dumping the body in a nearby forest			2
his son tells me : ‘ @entity132 would have been just another statistic , except the favela rose up			0
’ the protest spawned riots across @entity69 and led to three deaths when police fired on @entity139 continues : ‘ the case got so much publicity they had to charge the cops			1
i hope they go to jail but @entity69 is a corrupt country			2
the police have a licence to kill			0
@entity148 will come and go but the violence will remain			0
’ clandestine police ‘ body dumps ’ have sprung up			0
one notorious dumping ground – @entity153 – has been given the gruesome nickname ‘ the microwave ’ because of reports of nightly fires and the smell of burning flesh			0
one witness who spoke on condition of anonymity said : ‘ the police cars enter without lights			0
one time we found four bodies riddled with bullets			0
we found a hand sticking up from the ground			0
’ when @entity69 was awarded the tournament in 2007 the government introduced a programme to ‘ pacify ’ hundreds of favelas			1
officials refuse to reveal the numbers who have died since the ‘ clean - up ’ operation started , but in @entity33 alone ten men have been killed since january			1
now the authorities are promising to ‘ secure ’ the slums using an elite military police squad called @entity183 , a shadowy organisation of highly - trained special forces whose logo is a dagger piercing a skull			2
tackle : the @entity69 government began ' cleaning up ' favelas in 2007 , as soon as they were awarded @entity5 last week @entity193 , 56 , buried her only son @entity194 , 26 , a popular dj and dancer after he was killed by police in the @entity199 - @entity198 favela which overlooks @entity77			1
police are thought to have mistaken him for a drug dealer			2
@entity193 says : ‘ the police told me he had fallen and died but when i saw his body in the morgue i found a bullet hole in his back			0
the only reason i got his body back was that people filmed the cops on cellphones			0
otherwise he would have “ disappeared ” along with all the others			0
’ she adds : ‘ there will be blood on the streets during the @entity5 , be sure of it			0
’ the number of registered ‘ disappearances ’ in @entity1 has surged from 3,997 in 2009 to 6,004 last year			0
@entity222 spokesman @entity221 said : ‘ the government is trying to paint a pretty picture for the world saying things have been cleaned up and that @entity69 is safe for tourists			1
but the reality is far darker			2

heavily armed police have been engaged in nightly gun fights with drug gangs in @entity234 favela
@entity33 favela overlooks @entity3 's plush @entity6 hotel in *beachside* *neighbourhood* of @entity239
