buses may be forced to increase their loads as passengers ' waistlines continue to expand at a frightening speed across @entity5			2
two - axle buses are feeling a serious strain from heavier commuters with an almost 20 per cent rise in overweight and obese adults , prompting the @entity11 to call for an extra two tonnes to be added onto the maximum limit			1
experts say that although these statistics are not surprising , it is yet another sign that obesity is a growing concern in @entity5			2
' it highlights that we as a nation really need to keep working hard at all levels to turn it around , although it 's not a quick fix problem , ' she told @entity36			0
' it is important for the safety of people to have appropriate transport arrangements and obviously if that is affecting the safety of buses then they need to address that			2
' the @entity11 's annual report states that when the laws were designed in 1989 the average adult 's weight was taken as 65kg			1
however , that was a conservative estimate , according to the @entity52 , with the average man weighing in at 77.4kg and the average woman at 62.6kg			0
since then , waistlines have only continued growing			2
the @entity11 says a 2011 - 12 @entity57 found the average male had increased to 86kg , while the average weight for a female was 71kg			1
the health report further found about 63 per cent of adults were now overweight or obese - up from 45 per cent in 1989			1
' it is possible that buses can be technically overloaded even when within their maximum passenger operating limits , ' the @entity11 annual report explains			1
the health report found about 63 per cent of adults were now overweight or obese - up from 45 per cent in 1989 something 's got to give , argue bus operators , and the @entity11 has recommended that the @entity70 develop a notice to allow an 18 - tonne nationwide limit			1
ms @entity73 said the obesity problem could stretch across all forms of transport			0
' it 's the same thing when you hope into a lift and it says this lift for 10 people and you look around and think " well they would have to be 10 very slim people to fit in here " , ' she said			0
' so it is an increasing problem certainly on other forms of transport - the dilemma is there whether it be planes			0
' but buses are not just struggling with fatter passengers			2
wheelchair access lifts , fuel - efficient engines , rollover protection devices and air - conditioning units are also adding weight to each bus			0
the notice to increase the limit by two tonnes is expected to be progressed over the next year , the @entity11 said			1
ms @entity73 said society must not lose hope on improving the issue with education and prevention being the key factors			0
' there are little glimmers of hope around such as in the @entity111 where the consumption of @entity113 's and @entity114 has been decreasing and their sales are dropping - perhaps it will be a bit of a trend that might reflect back eventually on weight loss but it takes time to see those changes , ' she said			0
' in @entity5 we know there has been a bit of improvement with children - but again it takes time to make those changes - but it means that governments need to keep investing in prevention programs and in ways of dealing with the problem			0
' the notice to increase the limit by two tonnes on buses is expected to be progressed over the next year			1
