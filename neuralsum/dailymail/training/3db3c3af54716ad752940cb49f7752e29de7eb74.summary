by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter veteran dj @entity3 , who claims that listeners prefer to hear men 's voices on the radio veteran dj @entity3 has claimed listeners prefer to hear male voices on the radio and that there are too too many women in presenting slots			1
his comments come after earlier this week it was announced @entity16 were to replace long - time presenters @entity18 and @entity19 , while @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 were to join			1
this is despite the @entity24 warning the station two years ago that it must do more to attract a ‘ more even balance ’ of listeners but only one hour a week at 5 @entity16 will now be solely anchored by a woman			1
but the 71 - year - old broadcaster defended the @entity16 's decision saying he believes there are ' quite a lot of women ' on the radio			1
he told the @entity35 : ' during the day women have always preferred the voices of men			2
i have no idea why			0
' there is nothing to stop women coming into broadcasting			0
' there are loads on @entity45			0
if you look at the news channels , they are all women			0
i do n't think there are enough men on			2
' the @entity16 also said that three out of seven of their daytime presenters were female and that they would continue to be ' champions of strong female voices on the radio '			1
last saturday , @entity57 had to stand in to provide cover when @entity59 failed to turn up to present his morning show on @entity45			1
@entity59 , 51 , who is paid £ 2.3million by the @entity16 , had been pictured the night before partying with celebrities including @entity62 and @entity63			1
but @entity3 , who presents a show after @entity59 ’s , said : ‘ i think he overslept and thought it was friday			2
it was something like that			0
i am always very early so i was there to stand in			0
’ long standing presenters @entity18 , left , and @entity19 , right , who are both to leave @entity16 the @entity74 star 's production team had to struggle on with the three - hour programme when he did n't make the 10am start			1
however , @entity59 seems to have recovered quickly , as he was seen walking his dogs in the early afternoon			2
the evening before the show he attended a party with tv chef @entity62 @entity80 , the co-presenter of the programme 's @entity82 problem spot , ended up carrying much of show on her own			2
last saturday , mr @entity3 had to stand in to provide cover when @entity59 , pictured , failed to turn up to present his morning show on @entity45 @entity80 said on - air : ' fear not , @entity82 is n't taking hormones			1
it 's @entity80 , his old mucker			0
' i 'm standing in because i fear he has been delayed slightly			0
but fear not he will be here			0
' anxious fans only found out the @entity93 presenter had ' been up all night being sick ' two hours into the show			0
the failure to explain @entity59 's absence led to speculation online that the 51 - year - old had gone to @entity99 or last week 's @entity100 in @entity101			1
a @entity16 female presenter , who is to leave her afternoon show has defended the @entity16 against gender bias			1
@entity19 , a former co-presenter of @entity16 's breakfast show with @entity106 said it should n't be the case that a job held by a woman should then be filled by another woman			1
@entity19 , 48 , said she would spend the summer ‘ exploring a number of opportunities , before deciding what ’s next ’			0
the broadcaster , who had been with 5 @entity16 for 15 years told @entity116 : ' i do n't think it would be a good thing if every time a controller made a decision he or she said it must be a woman			2
' would they have been right to choose a woman just so it looked right , even though they did n't feel that woman was right for the job ? ' i really do n't feel affronted , as a feminist , that every job a woman has is n't then filled by another woman .			0
