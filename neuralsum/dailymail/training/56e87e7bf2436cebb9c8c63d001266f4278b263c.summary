‘ you have seen a little glimpse of the future and that is what this club is about , ’ said an emotional @entity0 after watching 18 - year - old @entity1 live up to the finest traditions of @entity3 by scoring twice on his debut against @entity5 on tuesday night			1
but it ’ll be the club ’s next manager @entity12 rather than @entity0 who has the ultimate responsibility to ensure the class of ’ 14 – @entity1 , @entity16 , @entity17 and others – become the future legends of @entity20			1
it ’s been @entity3 ’s way since the days of @entity23 to trust young players			1
sir @entity25 thought @entity26 would be a good custodian of the tradition , but he was wrong			0
scratch beneath the surface with @entity48 – he 's renowned for being arrogant , demanding and a disciplinarian – and you ’ll find a very impressive track record in developing young players			1
some would point out that @entity25 ’s decision to throw in the kids at @entity3 in 1995 – @entity61 , @entity41 , @entity39 – came only a few months after @entity48 had won the @entity62 with an @entity45 team packed with youth ; @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 among them			1
it was 18 - year - old @entity68 who scored the winning goal against an @entity74 team previously regarded as invincible in the final			1
coming through : @entity67 ( left ) and @entity29 ( right ) both benefited from @entity48 's youth policy in the 1990s faith : @entity48 gave @entity30 ( left ) his debut for @entity46 when he was just 18 years old instant impact : @entity68 ( left ) scored the winning goal in the 1995 @entity62 final for @entity48 @entity82 attacking midfield , age : 18 real flair player , very skilful			1
signed from @entity86 and has an eye for scoring spectacular goals such as the one against @entity89 in the @entity91 semi final last weekend			0
@entity92 - born but qualifies for @entity93 also			0
@entity94 goalkeeper , age : 17 born in @entity97 but is @entity99 number one			0
highly - rated goalkeeper joined after a trial and is tipped to carve out a career at the top			0
has excellent attitude , is 6ft 3ins tall , a good shot - stopper and not afraid to come for crosses			0
@entity107 @entity108 , age : 18 cultured 6ft 3ins tall midfielder who was signed from @entity112 for £ 100,000			0
sprays the ball around very well and always finds time on the ball			0
not had opportunities to break into @entity116 due to amount of midfielders but has excelled in @entity99			0
@entity118 attacking midfield , age : 16 one of the top talents in the country for his age group ; highly sought after by @entity126 's top clubs , is skilful midfielder who is also comfortable playing in the second striker role			0
has played above his age group throughout his young career			0
@entity133 - @entity132 centre - back , age : 15 tall for his age at 6ft 2ins , @entity132 is a dominant centre back but has good feet and is able to bring the ball out of defence with an eye for a pass also			0
has made number of appearances for @entity3 's @entity99 and has been capped by his country			1
it ’s a pattern that has emerged throughout the @entity147 ’s career			1
at @entity46 , he gave @entity30 his debut at the age of 18			1
with @entity47 , @entity31 and other young @entity152 players got their chance under @entity48			1
why ? first of all , @entity48 likes attacking football			1
he spends far more time working on that than defence and young players have the pace , energy and sense of adventure you need in an attack - minded team			1
the way the @entity45 side of ’ 95 dismantled ageing legends like @entity167 by playing with a fast , positive tempo marked a seachange in @entity171 football			0
their average age was only 23 and that included veteran @entity175			0
secondly , @entity48 likes there to be only one voice in decision - making – his own			2
young players are more likely to be open to new ideas from the coach			2
essentially , they want to play and they want to please , and are happy to be guided by a figure like @entity48			2
older professionals may backchat or be more resistant			0
@entity25 may have found the same with @entity3			2
at @entity3 , @entity48 will find plenty of young players to assess			1
not only those like @entity1 , @entity17 and @entity16 who made such an impression against @entity5 , but others like @entity187 and @entity188 who have been on loan this season in @entity191			1
even @entity25 ’s last signing @entity193 , who fell out badly with @entity26 , is still only 21			2
there is one proviso of course			0
they have to be good enough			0
when the name @entity201 was coined , it was n’t for the class of ’ 92 of @entity61 , @entity39 , @entity40 etc – but for the previous generation ; @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206			1
they were given their first - team chances early by @entity25 and helped him win his first trophy , the @entity210 in 1990			0
but ultimately despite their youth and energy bringing a feelgood factor to @entity20 , @entity25 decided they were n’t good enough for the highest level			2
it ’s a sobering thought for the group who may yet become ' @entity48 ’s @entity220 '			2
but they will at least get their chance			0
as @entity0 , microphone in hand on tuesday night , reiterated : ‘ this club always gives youth its chance			1
’ future star : @entity48 helped @entity31 emerge from @entity47 's academy and into the first team @entity232 words : @entity48 gives @entity31 some advice during a @entity235 clash with @entity236 in september 2009 @entity237 ? @entity48 is believed to want a reunion with @entity47 star @entity239 at @entity20 after helping to develop him at the @entity240 room for improvement : @entity193 has been on loan at @entity244 after failing to make an impression under former boss @entity26 experience : @entity3 youngster @entity187 ( left ) has impressed on loan at @entity191 side @entity247 this season @entity45 he made them one of the most remarkable teams of the @entity62 era			1
with an average age of just 23 , they took the @entity147 ideal of @entity254 to new heights and beat mighty @entity74 1 - 0 to win the 1995 @entity62			2
they also reached the final the following year against @entity258 which they lost on penalties , making them the team to have come closest to retaining @entity264 ’s biggest prize			0
eventually their best players were sold on but that young @entity48 team of ’ 95 will still go down in history as one of the best - ever			1
it was : @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity175 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity67 , @entity277			0
subs – @entity68 , @entity69			2
half the team were aged 22 or under and @entity65 , @entity68 and @entity69 were all teenagers			2
@entity46 he had two spells at the @entity284 and though his second stint ( 2002 - 03 ) was unsuccessful with @entity46 going through a transitional phase , history shows @entity48 was an important catalyst for the success that followed			1
he gave 18 - year - old @entity30 his debut in the @entity62 against @entity290 , and the youngster gave a performance described in the next day ’s @entity294 press as ' sensational '			1
he proved to be a good judge , @entity30 came to win everything in the game with @entity46 and scored @entity299 ’s winning goal in the 2010 @entity301 final			1
@entity302 and 22 - year - old @entity29 were also regulars in his team			0
the midfield partnership of @entity29 and @entity30 came to symbolise the domination of @entity308 tiki - taka football for a decade			2
@entity47 @entity47 was in chaos when @entity48 arrived – in civil war after unsuccessful spells in charge by @entity313 , @entity314 and @entity315			0
@entity48 did things his way , strong leadership and emphasis on young players , introducing 20 - year - old @entity31 and @entity321 , 19 , into a team that won the @entity235			1
@entity239 , 20 , also forced his way into the line - up after serving a spell on loan at @entity327 .			0

@entity12 will be the man responsible for *nurturing* @entity3 's young talent when he takes control of the club
the @entity147 has a record of developing players including @entity68 , @entity31 and @entity30
@entity3 academy star @entity1 scored two goals on his debut against @entity5 on tuesday night
the @entity20 club have a history of producing talented players including @entity0 , @entity61 , @entity39 and @entity342
@entity48 will work with youngsters including @entity193 and @entity187
