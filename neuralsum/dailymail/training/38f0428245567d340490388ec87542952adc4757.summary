by @entity0 a shocking new video illustrates how race and color continue to play a major role in how someone is perceived in @entity7 society			0
the video , shot in @entity9 , compares the general public ’s reaction to first a white male , then a black male , attempting to break into a car			1
the social experiment was the idea of @entity17 , who hosts the @entity19 channel @entity18			1
@entity25 , who is white , attempts to break into the car with a wire hanger			2
despite the car ’s alarm blaring , no one pays him any attention and at one point the police even drive past without stopping to confront him			0
after 30 minutes , @entity17 gives up and then we see the radically different reaction when @entity21 , who is black , takes up the challenge			1
instantly passers - by are suspicious and a group of men standing nearby start to take pictures on a phone			0
at one point a cop car drives past , as @entity17 brazenly tries to break into a car and its alarm is sounding loudly within two minutes , the @entity49 arrive – possibly alerted by the passers - by – and @entity21 is instantly greeted with a harsh attitude and an order to put his hands up			1
‘ let me see your f * * king hands , ’ orders one cop			0
‘ get up against the wall			0
’ @entity21 is quickly surrounded by at least five officers and placed in handcuffs			0
that ’s where the shocking video ends , although in reality @entity17 quickly stepped in and explained to the police what was happening			2
critics might complain that the video is staged , but @entity17 says it was inspired by being involved in similar double standards situation in real - life			2
when @entity21 attempts to break into the car he receives a different reaction and immediately passers - by are suspicious of him as @entity21 attempts to break into the car , some men standing nearby shoot him dirty looks and one starts to take photos on their phone he had locked himself out of his car and called the @entity80 to help him get back into it			1
the mechanic who arrived was black and @entity17 was immediately aware that when he started working the car door , strangers started staring while they had simply ignored his own attempts			1
according to @entity17 , the goal of the video is to raise awareness of how people are treated differently depending on their color			0
in fact , @entity92 statistics show that 64 percent of motor vehicle theft was carried out by whites in 2011 , while black perpetrators were responsible for 33.9 percent			1
the video was posted online just days after @entity98 , a white man who fired on a group of black teenagers in @entity101 , killing one , was convicted on three attempted murder counts but escaped his most serious charge of first - degree murder			2
@entity98 's verdict has revived conversations about how white and black @entity7 face markedly different levels of suspicion and hostility in many situations			0
within two minutes of @entity21 approached the car , the @entity49 has arrived and he is ordered to step away from the vehicle @entity21 is quickly surrounded by police officers and placed in handcuffs critics might complain that the video is staged , but @entity17 says it was inspired by being involved in similar double standards situation in real - life			1

@entity17 , who is white , spent 30 minutes trying to break into a car and no - one approached him
@entity21 , who is black , tried the same stunt and got arrested inside two minutes
@entity126 was part of a social experiment carried out for @entity17 ' @entity19 channel @entity18
in reality , @entity92 figures show the majority of car crime is carried out by white perpetrators
