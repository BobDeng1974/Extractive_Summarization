before @entity23 gave birth , the family were torn between conflicting advice from the country doctor , dr @entity69 and a specialist sir @entity70			2
dr @entity69 had noticed worrying symptoms , including her ' muddled ' mental state , and swollen ankles ; and urged the family to bring @entity23 to the hospital , while sir @entity70 disagreed			2

' ' in the end , we were a people in mourning , ' he said			0
the episode has also brought eclampsia , the most serious form of preeclampsia , back to the world 's conscious as an incredibly dangerous complication that still affects many pregnant women today			1
who is to blame ? @entity23 's grief - stricken mother @entity90 , @entity125 , blames @entity99 , @entity100 , for @entity23 's death after he sided with sir @entity70 's fatal advice not to take her to the hospital she 's gone : @entity1 's executive producer , @entity109 , told @entity110 that the devastating episode left @entity21 as ' a nation gobsmacked ' the @entity130 said in a statement issued after the show aired sunday night : ' although the fictional tv series represents life in the early 1900s , women in the @entity25 and elsewhere still die or suffer terrible outcomes from the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy			1
' in the developed world , eclampsia is rare and usually treatable if appropriate intervention is promptly sought , ' but left untreated , the seizures can result in coma , brain damage and potentially in maternal or infant death			0
according to the @entity146 , one in ten women will develop preeclampsia , which can shut down the kidneys or liver , cause blood vessel spasms and even cause the placenta to detach from the uterus , and one in 100 will develop the more serious eclampsia , which goes to brain and causes life - threatening seizures			0
@entity159 typically appears after the 20th week of pregnancy , but can also be present in the six weeks post-partum , and often , ' women who have preeclampsia do not feel sick , ' according to the @entity164			0

farewell my sister : @entity170 kisses her dead sister 's forehead just the two of us : a devastated @entity89 is now left to raise their baby , who he named @entity23 , alone ' nearly 80 % of women who die from preeclampsia die postpartum			0
sleep deprivation , postpartum depression , more attention on the newborn and a lack of familiarity with normal postpartum experiences all contribute to more easily ignoring or missing indicators of a problem			0
' @entity189 dr. @entity188 told @entity190 : ' it 's something that pregnant women need to realize and some ob 's miss it			0
' even after you have delivered , if you get a severe headache or dizziness or start seeing spots , or all of a sudden you get dramatic edema ( swelling ) in the legs , you need go to the emergency room .			0
