it is a tragedy ... the tragedy is the death of the bull			0

but three bulls yesterday turned the tables on their killers			1
they challenged their own ritual slaughter - and won			0
ol√© ! @entity18 is floored by an @entity20 fighting bull during a bullfight at @entity23 bullring in @entity24 beast versus man : the matador is tossed backwards by the huge bull , which is primed for the kill floored : @entity18 was downed by his first bull , before he was even able to plant any banderillos into its body head over heels : @entity18 is flicked around the bullring like a ragdoll by the enraged bull he intended to kill gored : @entity18 was pierced through his femoral artery by the bull , and needed immediate emergency surgery the goring is seen here from another angle			1
@entity18 was still in intensive care today but was said to be recovering disaster : @entity18 's fellow matadors run to his aide , capes flapping , as he is repeatedly gored by the raging bull occupational hazard : assistants help a grimacing @entity18 from the bullring after he was badly wounded in the fight yesterday a right bulls up : the injured matador is carried away as his blood drips down the elaborate outfit of one of his assistants @entity60 3 - @entity61 0			1
if bullfights had a score line that would have been the one at the @entity23 ring in @entity24 , @entity11 , on tuesday evening			1
all three matadors were gored , one of them severely , and the rest of the bloody spectacle was cancelled because there was nobody left standing to fight			2
it happened at the 12th corrida in the @entity11 capital , less than half - way through the @entity74 , the biggest single event in the official season			1
described by @entity8 as the ' @entity78 of bullfighting ' , it lasts for nearly a month with a fight every day			1
@entity81 is gored in his leg by a @entity84 ranch fighting bull after killing the one that took out @entity18 @entity81 falls to the ground bleeding after his clash with the bull			0
fighting bulls usually weigh about half a ton tragedy : @entity81 's cape drops to reveal the bull 's bloodied back , as it makes sure he is unable to get back up death in the afternoon : the bull which beat @entity98 spews blood after it is killed by @entity100 , top second left , in the traditional manner - but without the flair and flamboyance which bullfight audiences come for victory : @entity100 salutes the spectators as the @entity84 ranch fighting bull dies at his feet first to lose was @entity18			2
brought down by his first bull of the afternoon , he was gored in three places as he was tossed around the ring like a rag doll			0
after @entity18 was carried - off and rushed to the infirmary for emergency surgery , @entity81 followed tradition and dispatched the bull using cape and sword			1
but he did so as swiftly as possible , with none of the flair audiences expect			0
then it was @entity81 's turn to fight his own first bull of the afternoon			0
within minutes he followed @entity126 to the infirmary with a single goring			0
@entity129 : after dispatching @entity81 's beast , @entity100 swings his cape as he fights his own bull ouch : but he was soon also stuck beneath the merciless charge of the bull he had intended to kill @entity100 's sword flies from his hand as the bull does its best to survive the mortal combat it has been forced into the bullfighter is tossed into the air by a flick of the bull 's neck , as both are stained red with blood there was little the matador could do on the day to fight back against the half - tonne of pure muscle and rage he was matched up against not getting up : with no one left to fight the remaining bulls , there was no alternative than to cancel the rest of the corrida - the first time in 35 years that a bullfight has been stopped during the @entity159 the one remaining matador , @entity100 , stepped into the ring and killed the animal , again swiftly and without flamboyance			1
then his own first bull sent him flying through the air , catching him on its horns three times			0
after @entity100 was taken to the infirmary the bull was enticed back into its stall alongside the pens of the other three who had also escaped their scheduled deaths in the afternoon			0
with no one left to fight them , there was no alternative than to cancel the rest of the corrida			2
it was the first time that had happened during @entity159 since 1979 , and only the third time in the fiesta 's history .			0
