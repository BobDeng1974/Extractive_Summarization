it might sound like it has come straight out of a @entity2 film , but the @entity3 is set to get a huge ‘ laser cannon ’ by the end of this year			2
this laser , however , may leave @entity7 a little underwhelmed , as instead of destroying the planet it will be used to study it in more detail			2
named the @entity12 , dubbed @entity13 , it will look at the distribution of aerosols in space to map pollution and changes in the climate			1
the size of a refrigerator , @entity13 will provide detailed information about the particles in @entity25 's atmosphere aerosols are the tiny particles that make up haze , dust , air pollutants , and smoke and could have far - reaching on the planet ’s environment , when @entity37 ’s @entity36 erupted nearly four years ago , for instance , officials grounded flights in @entity39			1
they believed particles contained within its massive plume could damage aircraft engines , resulting in potentially deadly consequences for passengers			2
@entity46 could n’t dispatch aircraft - borne instruments for the very same reasons @entity39 officials had grounded commercial aircraft			2
the laser is scheduled to launch to the space station later this year as a demonstration project and will fire around 5,000 laser pulses per second the @entity55 ( @entity13 ) will provide measurements of the particulate contents within the atmosphere including clouds and aerosols			1
a powerful laser will provide data on the location , composition and distribution of atmospheric elements which impact the climate on a global scale			0
this refrigerator - sized sensor laser is scheduled to launch to the space station in late this year as a demonstration project and will fire around 5,000 laser pulses per second			1
long - term data from the laser may reveal shifts in global climate over time and location			0
but using @entity13 , when the next volcano erupts , @entity46 will be able to monitor the spread of particles in @entity25 ’s atmosphere from its space - based perch			1
this refrigerator - sized sensor laser is scheduled to launch to the space station in late 2014 as a demonstration project and will fire around 5,000 laser pulses per second			0
its sensors will help researchers determine for the first time exactly what laser technology can do from space to measure tiny airborne particles - also known as aerosols - in @entity25 ’s atmosphere			1
developed by scientist @entity93 , and his team , @entity13 will be able to see the character as well as vertical and horizontal distribution of aerosols in a whole new light			1
the laser may leave @entity7 a little underwhelmed , as instead of destroying the planet , like the @entity100 ( pictured ) , it will be used to study the @entity25 in more detail this will deliver more detailed information and could help scientists differentiate between the types of particles in the atmosphere			0
‘ you get better data quality because you make fewer assumptions , and you get , presumably , a more accurate determination of what kind of particles you ’re seeing in the atmosphere , ’ said dr @entity93			0
knowing where aerosols are located in the atmosphere - such as smoke from forest fires , dust blowing off vast deserts , and plumes from erupting volcanoes - is often critically important			1
the station travels in a precessing orbit , which means that instead of passing over the same spot at the same time , its orbit moves			0
by reflecting sunlight into space , clouds help regulate the @entity25 's climate			2
this image was taken from aboard the @entity3 , which is where @entity13 will measure cloud aerosols the station ’s ground track moves westward along each of 16 daily tracks as it travels , with ground track repeats every three days			1
as a result , @entity12 will provide good coverage of what ’s happening over primary population centres			2
in addition , the station passes over and along many of the primary aerosol - transport paths within @entity25 ’s atmosphere			0
one of @entity25 ’s primary transport routes for airborne pollutants is from @entity150			0
particles are transported by circulation cells in @entity25 ’s atmosphere over @entity154 , northward up just under @entity155 , and then down towards the @entity156 of the @entity157 , making a big , inverted ‘ @entity159 ’ shape			0
long - term data from the laser may also reveal the shifts in global climate over time and location			0
in 2010 , @entity37 's @entity36 erupted , creating an expansive ash cloud that disrupted air traffic throughout @entity39 and across the @entity168			0
the @entity55 ( @entity13 ) could improve the ability to measure volcanic particles and other aerosols from space			1

@entity12 , dubbed @entity13 , to be *installed* this year
it will study distribution of aerosols that make up haze , dust and pollutants
for instance , it could look at plumes of ash clouds , which are currently *difficult* to model from space and can ground aircraft
