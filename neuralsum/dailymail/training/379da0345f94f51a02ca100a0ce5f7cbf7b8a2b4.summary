when cage fighter @entity1 felt something bite his leg on holiday he thought it was nothing more than a mosquito			1
the now 32 - year - old and his girlfriend @entity9 were in @entity10 , @entity11 , having celebrated a friend 's wedding last february			1
it was only when the couple spotted a spider crawling on the floor , near the bed , they realised the situation could be more serious			1
within hours , mr @entity1 ' lower right leg had inflated to twice its size , as poison surged through his veins			1
the area around the bite became red and inflamed , and was hot to touch , he told @entity35 he had been bitten by a @entity28 - a small arachnid with a potent , venomous bite			1
the bite was start of a month - long ordeal which left him with three holes in his leg , oozing pus			1
' it did n't really hurt to start with , ' mr @entity1 told @entity35			1
' we were n't sure what it was to start with , it felt a bit like a bug bite			1
' i was in bed			0
it was n't even a very big spider , i just flicked something off my leg and only later realised it was a spider			1
' i started to react really quickly			0
within hours my knee had ballooned			0
it did n't half kick in quick			0
' my leg just kept growing , like it had been inflated with a pump			1
' it got to the point when you could n't even see my knee cap			0
' refusing to see a doctor , it was miss @entity9 who insisted her boyfriend be seen by a medic			1
the 27 - year - old , told @entity35 : ' it was pretty scary			1
when it first happened we just thought it was a mosquito bite			1
' it was n't until we saw the spider than we realised what had happened			2
' @entity1 was refusing to call the doctor , but as it started to swell i just decided to call the resort doctor			1
' as soon as they said the word " hospital " to us , i was terrified			2
you automatically assume the worst			2
' mr @entity1 said he started to worry about the cost of treatment aboard , despite the couple having travel insurance			1
' we had heard horror stories about hospital stays on our trip , and while we had insurance you often have to pay thousands up front , ' he said			2
' we were at the end of our two week holiday , it had been pretty pricey			0
mr @entity1 was bitten by a @entity28 , a small spider often measuring six to 20mm , with a powerful , venomous bite the couple were due to fly home the next morning , but instead found themselves in hospital where doctors prescribed mr @entity1 anti-biotics to try and treat the bite the brown recluse spider is a small arachnid , measuring between six and 20mm , with a venomous bite			1
the species often live between one and two years			0
each female produces several egg sacs over a period of two to three months from may to july , with around 50 eggs in each			0
the eggs hatch over the course of a month			0
the spiderlings take about a year to grow to adulthood			2

they are found roughly south of a line from southeastern @entity127 through southern @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 to southwestern @entity131			0
the species is rarely aggressive , and bites are uncommon			0
the spider ususally only bites when pressed against the skin , when tangled in clothes , towels , bedding , etc. the bite is often not immediately painful but can be dangerous			1
the species bears the potentially deadly hemotoxic venom			0
most bites are minor but in more severe cases the venom spreads throughout the body and can form a necrotising ulcer that destroys soft tissue and may take months to heal , leaving deep scars			0
' by the time we got to hospital my knee had started to blow up really bad			2
' doctors told me i was n't allowed to fly and had to wait another day and a half before we were allowed to head home			1
' but when the couple arrived home to @entity157 , @entity158 , mr @entity1 ' recovery did not go according to plan			1
while in most cases a bite from a @entity28 is minor , mr @entity1 was one of the unlucky ones			1
he suffered what is known as a necrotising ulcer , where the poison eats away at the flesh around the site of the bite			2
he told @entity35 : ' it was horrible			0
the poison must 've really got in there			0
' there was a hole in my leg so big you could stick a cotton bud in it			1
' he waited for a while to see if the medication he had been given would start to work			2
but a week later and still taking antibiotics , the treatment ' just was n't doing anything ' , mr @entity1 told @entity35			1
' my leg was hot , like it was burning , he said			2
' i could see it was turning into an open wound			0
' i squeezed it and what came out was the most disgusting thing i have seen			0
it was pouring out of my leg , it was horrible			2
with pus streaming down his leg , mr @entity1 was admitted to hospital , where doctors prescribed more antibiotics to try and stem the spread of the infection			1
he said : ' @entity9 took me back to hospital , they informed my that the venom was eating away at my skin which was preventing the wound from healing			1
mr @entity1 , told @entity35 : ' i started to react really quickly			1
within hours my knee had ballooned			0
it did n't half kick in quick			0
my leg just kept growing , like it had been inflated with a pump ' when the couple arrived back to their home in @entity157 , @entity158 , mr @entity1 ' recovery did not go according to plan			1
he started to notice pus oozing from the bite , which had become an open wound			2
after visiting hospital at home , it took around a month before the cage fighter was back on his feet ' long story short , i was in agony , hot and cold sweats , constant headaches and vomiting			1
' i physically could n't walk and was bed bound for weeks			0
' @entity9 had to help me to the bathroom where i could n't stand and i had to take a month of work			2
i was left with three huge holes in my knee , you could see all the way down to the bone where the spider venom had eaten away at my flesh			2
' it was around a month later before the cage fighter and owner of @entity239 , was fully recovered			0
he said the ordeal has only heightened his fear of spiders and bugs			0
he told @entity35 : ' i hate all bugs , i do n't like them full stop			0
' anything with more than four legs and i 'm not really interested , even less so now			0
' it took over a month for my skin to start growing back , i 'm left with a huge scar and a large bald patch on my knee where 's its scared tissue the hair wont grow back			0
' his girlfriend of four years , @entity257 , 27 , said it was ' terrifying ' watching her partner suffering			0
she said : ' hospitals abroad are already more scary , we could n't really understand whether they were telling us @entity1 was fine or he was on death 's door			2
' they could 've been saying anything to us			0
