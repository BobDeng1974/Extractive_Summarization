when class favourite @entity1 the goldfish appeared to have a tumour , staff at the school feared there was only one likely outcome			1
however the seven - year - old fish has now made medical history after he became the first in @entity11 to receive microsurgery to remove the growth			1
@entity1 has now made a full recovery and is back with pupils at @entity17 primary school in @entity18 , @entity19			1
@entity21 the goldfish became the first in @entity11 to have a lump removed by a vet in @entity19 using microsurgery teachers at the school feared @entity1 had developed cancer and took him to veterinary surgeon @entity28			1
mr @entity28 had seen a similar , world - first procedure earlier this year on an @entity31 goldfish called @entity21 and offered to repeat the treatment			1
he cut out the lump using intricate micro-surgery and the procedure went so well , the vet has offered to repeat the treatment			1
the pet fish was sedated by infusing his tank with anaesthetic before he was removed and placed on a plastic tray with a pipe flowing into his mouth to monitor his tiny heart			0
staff feared the seven - year - old goldfish , a favourite at his primary school , had developed a cancerous tumour @entity28 performed the pioneering surgery on @entity1 the goldfish at @entity52 in @entity19 mr @entity28 said @entity1 started swimming round the tank and eating minutes after the surgery was completed mr @entity28 , did the work for free at @entity19 's @entity52 , and said the biggest concern was getting @entity1 to go to sleep as they were concerned about giving him too much anaesthetic			1
he said once the fish was unconscious they sprinkled water on his mouth and gills while he got to work removing the tumour			2
he said : ' we did not know how serious the tumour was or whether it was benign			0
but it may have grown and got close to his eye			0
' it was a bit terrifying but i made it clear that if the operation did no go to plan we might lose him , but we decided the risk was worth taking			0
dr @entity77 , head of exotics and wildlife medicine at @entity80 in @entity31 performed the world - first surgery on @entity21 the goldfish in september that inspired @entity1 's groundbreaking procedure ' we did something called an electro cautery			1
basically , we have a small wire attached to something like a pen that cuts and coagulates the flesh at the same time so it stops the bleeding			0
' we had @entity1 lying in a plastic dish attached to small probe called a @entity95 probe that monitored his heart rate			2
' the whole operation only took about five minutes but it took about 45 minutes to get him to sleep			0
' i was so delighted when i saw him coming round , i did give a little fist pump			0
' @entity103 involves using heat from a metal probe , conducted by an electric current			0
this allows the cutting through of soft tissue and is known as diathermy			0
@entity1 has returned to his school in @entity19 at the same time the heat seals , or cauterises the cut , preventing bleeding			1
@entity103 was used for the first time on goldfish @entity1 in @entity31 in september this year			1
@entity103 is routinely used on humans and is seen as a safer alternative to chemical cautery			0
it is often used to stop bleeding after an injury or during surgery			0
mr @entity28 said once the surgery was completed @entity1 woke up around five minutes later and was swimming round the tank and eating			2
the surgery had been arranged for half - term to give staff at @entity17 primary school in @entity18 , @entity19 , the chance to break the news sensitively if it failed			1
@entity1 was named after tennis star @entity130 and previously shared his tank with a another goldfish named @entity133 - after @entity133			2
@entity1 's tumour developed over the summer holidays after @entity133 died and teacher @entity136 thinks it may have been caused by the trauma of losing his companion			2
@entity136 said : ' it seems strange that @entity133 died in june and almost immediately the tumour began to grow			0
' it was growing rapidly and within a couple of weeks it became very noticeable			0
' the kids love him and the first thing they asked when they got back after half - term was ' is @entity149 ? ' ' we were a bit worried about how they would react if it did not go well , which is why we waited until half - term			1
' the children have written about @entity1 and painted him and will be now writing letters to thank those involved , and the children want to interview @entity28 to ask him questions about what he did			1
' he got back on wednesday and the children are ecstatic			2
' a biopsy of the tumour has since confirmed it was benign , but it could have grown causing him to go blind had it not been removed .			0
