@entity0 were beaten 1 - 0 by @entity1 at @entity2 on saturday meaning if @entity4 beat @entity6 sunday lunchtime they will move to the top of @entity8			1
@entity9 hit the post from 50 yards out but it was the closest @entity12 ’s team came as an @entity14 header in the first half was enough to give @entity1 a famous victory that could seriously derail @entity0 ’s title charge			1
they started brightly enough with @entity19 swapping passes with @entity21 and crossing for @entity22 , only for @entity24 ’s clearance to stop the ball reaching @entity0 ’s top scorer			2
@entity14 ( right ) leads the celebrations with his @entity1 team - mates after putting them ahead with a tremendous header the @entity1 players wheel away to celebrate with their supporters having taken the lead against @entity0 @entity19 ( left ) and @entity22 look on as the @entity1 team celebrate scoring in the first half @entity12 ( right ) saw his team dominate possession but struggle to break down @entity1 's defensive display @entity14 ( left ) challenges @entity38 for possession in a stubborn defensive display from @entity1 at the @entity40 @entity1 : @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 ( toquero , 91 ) , @entity48 , @entity50 ( @entity49 , 64 ) @entity14 , @entity52 ( @entity51 , 75 )			1

@entity0 : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity21 , @entity66 ( @entity65 , 71 ) , @entity67 , @entity38 ( @entity68 , 76 ) , @entity22 , @entity9 , @entity19 ( @entity69 , 80 )			1

bookings : @entity21 , @entity76 , @entity38 , @entity67			0
att : 51,000 @entity1 had been on a good run with two league wins and a cup semi-final victory and they were soon into their stride with forwards @entity52 and @entity14 stretching a @entity0 defence under - protected by a midfield still missing @entity85 who will not be back until midweek in the @entity87			1
when @entity1 ’s goal came it was that midfield weakness that created the opening			2
@entity47 had all the time and space he wanted to cross for @entity14 and the on - form centre - forward rose to head home his 18th goal of the season			2
@entity67 should have got across to @entity96 more quickly			0
@entity64 might also be disappointed he was beaten so easily by @entity14 in the air , but the athletic striker , who scored twice in midweek to put @entity1 in the @entity99 , is on such good form that there is talk of a @entity104 call - up despite his 34 years			1
he hung for a moment in the air having got in front of the @entity0 defender and powered his header past @entity61			1
real looked disjointed all over the pitch			0
@entity38 kicked - out at @entity111 and was booked and @entity112 was yellow carded shortly afterwards for a foul on @entity50			0
@entity1 also had @entity14 and @entity44 booked but they were keeping their heads and their shape better than their rivals			1
@entity0 raised the tempo in the second half and @entity9 lead the assault on @entity1 ’s goal			1
when he tricked his way down the right and pulled the ball back from the byline it looked like producing the equalizer			0
but before @entity22 could sweep the ball home from three yards out @entity41 got a hand to the cross to divert it to safety			0
@entity0 's @entity21 ( right ) drops to his knees in response to chance being passed up by his team in the first half @entity22 cut a frustrated figure , especially in the first half , as his attacking threat was regularly nullified @entity1 striker @entity141 ( second left ) tries to keep the ball away from the approaching @entity0 player @entity143 @entity21 ( right ) is crowded out by @entity1 players as the @entity146 international tries to create an opening for @entity0 @entity67 forced a save from @entity41 after taking a pass from @entity22 but @entity1 were keeping the @entity151 champions at bay			1
their keeper was making sure of it charging off his line to deny @entity19 with @entity0 ’s next chance			2
@entity12 took his time to make his first change and when it came it was a brave one			0
winger @entity65 replace midfielder @entity112 and @entity0 went from 4 - 3 - 3 to 4 - 2 - 4 with @entity9 and @entity65 on the flanks and @entity22 and @entity19 through the middle			1
@entity22 claimed a penalty when he tumbled over @entity41 but the referee was right to call it @entity1 ’s way			2
@entity14 then went close with a header at the other end			2
both @entity38 and @entity52 were replaced by their respective managers with 15 minutes left			0
@entity52 had run himself into the ground ; @entity38 has been running himself into the ground for weeks and desperately needs to be rested			0
despite the changes threir was still no way through for @entity0 and @entity12 played his last card replacing @entity19 with @entity69			0
@entity1 defender @entity111 ( left ) tries to control the ball under pressure from @entity0 midfielder @entity38 @entity22 ( centre ) vies for possession with @entity1 midfielder @entity47 in the @entity8 encounter on saturday the impressive @entity1 striker @entity52 ( left ) holds off the challenge of @entity0 defender @entity62 @entity19 ( left ) holds off the challenge of @entity46 in the @entity8 match between @entity0 and @entity1 @entity22 ( left ) queries a decision made by @entity188 referee @entity187 during the defeat to @entity1 with seven minutes left the leveler almost came in the most spectacular fashion			1
tired of @entity0 ’s attempts to pass through the defence , @entity9 lifted his head just inside of @entity1 's half and tried to lob @entity41			1
the audacious long - distance shot came back off the frame of the goal			0
even by his high standards it would have been a spectacular goal			0
it also would have been very hard on @entity1 who deserved their three points			0

@entity14 put @entity1 into a shock lead in the 26th minute with a powerful header
@entity9 *smacked* the post with an *astonishing* attempt from around 45 yards out for @entity0 on *83* minutes
@entity4 have the chance to replace @entity0 in first place on sunday after the defeat
