by @entity1 reporter published : 07:55 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 08:04 est , 3 october 2012 a multibillion - dollar information - sharing network of 77 so - called fusion centers violated @entity6 ’ civil rights and failed to produce any valuable intelligence on terrorism , according to a scathing @entity10 report released on wednesday			1
what began as an attempt to put local , state and federal officials in the same room analyzing the same intelligence has instead cost huge amounts of money for data - mining software , $ 6,000 laptops , flat screen televisions and , in @entity23 , two $ 45,000 fully equipped @entity25 that are used for commuting , investigators found			1
the 141 - page , bipartisan report is an unflinching evaluation of what the @entity29 has held up as a crown jewel of its security efforts			2
wasteful : a @entity10 report concluded that fusion centers improperly collected information about innocent @entity6 and produced no valuable intelligence on terrorism the report underscores a reality of post- 9/11 @entity40 : national security programs tend to grow , never shrink , even when their money and manpower far surpass the actual subject of terrorism			1
much of this money went for ordinary local crime - fighting			0
disagreeing with the critical conclusions of the report , @entity29 says it is outdated , inaccurate and too focused on information produced by the program , ignoring benefits to local governments from their involvement with federal intelligence officials			1
because of a convoluted grants process set up by @entity57 , @entity29 officials do n't know how much they have spent in their decade - long effort to set up so - called fusion centers in every state			1
government estimates range from less than $ 300million to $ 1.4billion in federal money , plus much more invested by state and local governments			1
federal funding is pegged at about 20 per cent to 30 per cent			0
despite that , @entity57 is unlikely to pull the plug			2
that 's because , whether or not it stops terrorists , the program means politically important money for state and local governments			2
a @entity72 reviewed more than 600 unclassified reports over a one - year period and concluded that most had nothing to do with terrorism			0
the panel 's chairman is democrat @entity79 of @entity80 , the ranking @entity82 @entity81 of @entity83			0
‘ the subcommittee investigation could identify no reporting which uncovered a terrorist threat , nor could it identify a contribution such fusion center reporting made to disrupt an active terrorist plot , ’ the report said			1
when fusion centers did address terrorism , they sometimes did so in ways that infringed on civil liberties			1
the centers have made headlines for circulating information about @entity107 supporters , the @entity102 , activists on both sides of the abortion debate , war protesters and advocates of gun rights			2
one fusion center cited in the @entity10 investigation wrote a report about a @entity113 community group 's list of book recommendations			1
others discussed @entity6 citizens speaking at mosques or talking to @entity113 groups about parenting			2
no evidence of criminal activity was contained in those reports			0
the government did not circulate them , but it kept them on government computers			0
the federal government is prohibited from storing information about @entity130 activities not related to crimes			1
‘ it was not clear why , if @entity29 had determined that the reports were improper to disseminate , the reports were proper to store indefinitely , ’ the report said			0
@entity29 spokesman @entity136 called the report ' out of date , inaccurate and misleading			0
' he said that it focused entirely on information being produced by fusion centers and did not consider the benefit the involved officials got receiving intelligence from the federal government			1
the report is as much an indictment of @entity57 as it is the @entity29			2
in setting up the department , lawmakers wanted their states to decide what to spend the money on			0
time and again , that setup has meant the federal government has no way to know how its security money is being spent			1
inside @entity29 , officials have long known there were problems with the reports coming out of fusion centers , the report shows			1
hundreds of draft reports sat for months , rendering them effectively obsolete , while @entity29 analysts who reviewed the reports would often deride the information in them as useless			0
‘ i see nothing to be gained by releasing this report , ’ one analyst wrote repeatedly on several draft reports			0
‘ this report does not provide the who , what , when , where , how , ’ another official complained about a document			0
‘ you would have some guys , the information you 'd see from them , you 'd scratch your head and say , “ what planet are you from ? ” 2 an unidentified homeland security official told @entity57			2
until this year , the federal reports officers received five days of training and were never tested or graded afterward , the report said			2
states have had criminal analysis centers for years			0
but the story of fusion centers began in the frenzied aftermath of the september			1
11 , 2001 , attacks			0
the @entity194 urged better collaboration among government agencies			2
as officials realized that a terrorism tip was as likely to come from a local police officer as the @entity201 , fusion centers became a hot topic			1
but putting people together to share intelligence proved complicated			1
special phone and computer lines had to be installed			0
the people reading the reports needed background checks			0
some information could only be read in secure areas , which meant construction projects			0
all of that cost money			0
branching out : homeland security secretary @entity215 embraced the idea that fusion centers should look beyond terrorism meanwhile , federal intelligence agencies were under orders from @entity57 to hire more analysts			1
that meant state and local agencies had to compete for smart counterterrorism thinkers			0
and federal training for local analysts was n't an early priority			0
though fusion centers receive money from the federal government , they are operated independently			1
counterterrorism money started flowing to states in 2003			0
but it was n't until late 2007 that the @entity237 administration told states how to run the centers			0
state officials soon realized there simply was n't that much local terrorism - related intelligence			2
terrorist attacks did n't happen often , but police faced drugs , guns and violent crime every day			0
normal criminal information started moving through fusion centers			1
under federal law , that was fine			2
when lawmakers enacted recommendations of the @entity194 in 2007 , they allowed fusion centers to study ' criminal or terrorist activity			1
' the law was co-sponsored by senators @entity258 and @entity259 , the driving forces behind the creation of @entity29			0
five years later , @entity10 investigators found , terrorism is often a secondary focus			0
‘ many fusion centers lacked either the capability or stated objective of contributing meaningfully to the federal counterterrorism mission , ’ the @entity10 report said			1
‘ many centers did n't consider counterterrorism an explicit part of their mission , and federal officials said some were simply not concerned with doing counterterrorism work			2
’ when @entity215 became @entity29 secretary in 2009 , the former @entity23 governor embraced the idea that fusion centers should look beyond terrorism			1
testifying before @entity57 that year , she distinguished fusion centers from the @entity284 - led @entity283 that are the leading investigative and analytical arms of the domestic counterterrorism effort			1
‘ a jttf is really focused on terrorism and terrorism - related investigations , ’ she said			0
‘ fusion centers are almost everything else			1
’ @entity57 , including the committee that authored the report , supports that notion			2
and though the report recommends the @entity10 reconsider the amount of money it spends on fusion centers , that seems unlikely			1
‘ @entity57 and two administrations have urged @entity29 to continue or even expand its support of fusion centers , without providing sufficient oversight to ensure the intelligence from fusion centers is commensurate with the level of federal investment , ’ the report said			1
and following the release of the report , @entity29 officials indicated their continued strong support for the program .			0

77 fusion centers were created to *encourage* law *enforcement* agencies to share intelligence
report says the information - sharing effort cost the federal government from $ 300million - $ 1.4billon
one fusion center reported a @entity113 community group 's reading list
@entity57 is likely to keep the fusion center program
