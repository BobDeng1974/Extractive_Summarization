children are being ‘ infantalised ’ by teachers who encourage them to learn history through mr @entity5 characters and @entity7 films , @entity0 said yesterday			1
in a blistering attack on school teaching , the @entity8 claimed pupils were being told to compare @entity12 and his henchmen to mr @entity5 characters and to learn about the @entity15 by watching @entity7 ’s @entity16			1
mr @entity0 also criticised the debasement of @entity19 lessons , saying some schools were telling pupils to read ‘ transient vampire books ’ like the @entity22 instead of ‘ transcendent @entity24 novels ’ such as @entity25 and @entity26			1
students were told to imagine @entity12 as a mr @entity5 character , @entity0 said in a damning critique on the way history has been taught in some schools he said teaching was being ‘ crushed under the weight of play - based pedagogy which infantilises children , teachers and our culture ’			1
in his speech to an education conference in @entity42 mr @entity0 referred to a website which suggests teenagers should translate the story of @entity46 into a tale in the style of @entity50 ’ mr @entity5 books			2
the website , www.activehistory.co.uk , written by a teacher working in @entity53 , tells students they should ‘ discuss which characters are the best match ’			0
‘ the activity is a great way of rounding off or revising the rise of @entity12 , ’ it says , adding the exercise could also help primary pupils learn about the period			2
mr @entity0 said history teaching is being ' crushed under the weight of play - based pedagogy ' the @entity22 vampire series by @entity67 was not a patch on @entity69 , mr @entity0 said as he warned young people should dream of taking part in the @entity72 , not finding fame in the @entity75 house mr @entity0 said : ‘ i may be unfamiliar with all of @entity50 ’ work but i am not sure he ever got round to producing mr @entity79 , mr @entity80 or mr @entity82 communist scapegoat			1
’ author @entity84 was praised for speaking out against the ' scandal ' of @entity87 children unable to use good grammar in fan letters he also referred to a 2012 issue of @entity92 , produced by the @entity93 , which suggests students learn about the @entity15 through @entity7 ’s portrayal of @entity96 as a cowardly lion			1
‘ if that proves too taxing then they are asked to organise a fashion parade or make plasticine models , ’ he said			0
mr @entity0 ’s comments come amid criticism of his proposed changes to the national curriculum from teachers and education academics			0
his plans for history teaching , in particular , have come under fire from critics who claim the new focus on key dates and characters is too narrow and will impede children ’s ability to think for themselves			2
@entity19 lessons were also being dumbed down , mr @entity0 warned , with the ‘ overwhelming majority ’ of @entity120 pupils studying 20th century texts , rather than books from an earlier period			2
mr @entity0 added : ‘ under this government ... the @entity124 is setting higher expectations for every child			0
because that is what parents want			0
’ @entity130 , who is responsible for the activehistory website , said : ‘ the purpose of the activity is a further challenge to get them ( students ) to think about it in a different way and to take a complex story which they have written an in - depth essay about and turn it into something that can be used for other students			0
’ mr @entity130 studied modern history at @entity144 , @entity145 , and worked at @entity146 before becoming head of history at the @entity149 .			0
