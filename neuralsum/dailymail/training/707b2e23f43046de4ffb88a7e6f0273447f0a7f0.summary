@entity2 , 52 , until recently the £ 130,000 - a - year second in charge of @entity3 , is the first chief officer to be arrested as a result of inquiries arising from @entity18 ’s @entity17 – which was set up to investigate allegations of bribes paid to police officers and other public officials			1
last night the police watchdog , whose investigators arrested @entity2 on suspicion of misconduct in a public office , stressed that ‘ at this stage ’ , no money is alleged to have changed hands between him and the reporter			1
his arrest at his home in @entity33 at 7am yesterday came just two months after he was awarded the @entity34 for distinguished service and followed an illustrious career which included a spell as head of @entity41 ’s @entity40 protection team			1
his arrest comes just weeks after another respected senior officer , @entity44 chief superintendent @entity43 , was arrested over alleged disclosures of confidential information to the media			1
he , too , is not suspected of receiving any payment from the media			0
@entity43 ’s arrest coincided with @entity51 plans to adopt many recommendations regarding contact between the @entity54 and police set out in the @entity56			1
such a move would significantly weaken a journalist ’s ability to resist police requests for confidential information on sources			2
so far 108 people , including more than 70 journalists , have been arrested in relation to three linked inquiries launched by @entity18 in the wake of the phone - hacking scandal			0
as well as the @entity71 inquiry into phone - hacking and @entity17 , a third investigation , @entity69 , is looking into computer hacking and other privacy breaches			2
@entity2 ’s most recent job as assistant commissioner of @entity3 – equivalent in rank to a deputy chief constable – included responsibility for counter-terrorism and saw him oversee several highly sensitive fraud investigations			1
ten years ago , when ‘ commander ’ of the same force , he rose to national prominence when he wrote a highly critical report about police failings which allowed an intruder to gatecrash prince @entity11 ’s party at @entity90 in 2002			0
his report , which made 28 recommendations for improving the security of the @entity94 , was widely praised for not pulling punches			0
speaking in 2003 , @entity2 said @entity11 ’s party had been dealt with as a private event with low - key security , when in fact it should have been treated as a high - profile event			2
ten years ago , when ' commander ' of @entity3 , he rose to national prominence when he wrote a critical report about police failings which allowed an intruder to gatecrash prince @entity11 's party at @entity90 in 2002 ‘ certainly this event taking place in a post- 11 september world should have warranted the highest level of security , ’ he said			0
a larger - than - life character , with a keen interest in rugby and raising money for charity , @entity2 was popular with junior officers before he left @entity3 last september to work in corporate protection			1
last night @entity119 , of the campaign group @entity120 , said the latest arrest was ‘ troubling ’			0
he added : ‘ in the @entity124 environment , it seems that more and more , informal contact between police officers and the @entity54 is being outlawed			0
such informal contact can have its own issues , but it is also crucially important for investigative reporting and scrutiny of the police and other authorities			0
’ the @entity133 said its investigators had arrested a 52 - year - old on ‘ suspicion of misconduct in public office in relation to the alleged passing of unauthorised information to a journalist ’			2
prince @entity143 and prince @entity11 sample food and produce at the @entity144 , as part of the celebrations leading up to @entity11 's 21st birthday sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
