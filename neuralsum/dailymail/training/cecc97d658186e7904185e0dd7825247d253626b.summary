by @entity0 and @entity1 continuing healthcare funding should be available to the families of those with degenerative diseases such as @entity6 , @entity7 's and dementia , but many families are unaware they can claim tens of thousands of families are being denied vital @entity13 funding for the care of relatives with dementia and other debilitating illnesses , according to a damning report			1
many are forced to sell their homes to pay for round - the - clock help – even though the health service should be picking up the bill			0
other patients are dying before receiving any money from the bureaucratic system			1
experts are now demanding an overhaul of the @entity13 continuing healthcare system			1
some trusts have slashed their budgets to such an extent that funding is now nearly a quarter of what it was two years ago			1
a scathing report found the system is ‘ not fit for purpose ’ and fails ‘ vulnerable people and their families at a time when they need the most support ’			1
it claims few people are aware the funding is available or that they may be entitled to it			2
charities including @entity47 , the @entity48 , and @entity49 , along with the @entity50 have today written to care and support minister @entity51 to demand an end to ‘ illogical reassessments ’ of progressively ill patients			2
@entity13 continuing healthcare is funding for patients who can not live without medical help , such as those who are paralysed or in the final stages of a degenerative condition such as @entity61 ’s or @entity7 ’s			1
alarmingly , the government has no figures on the numbers eligible for such care , although 59,000 currently receive it			2
charities have previously estimated another 60,000 should get the money but do not			1
but even this figure is likely to be an underestimate ; there are 800,000 with @entity61 ’s and another 127,000 with @entity7 ’s alone in the @entity71 , although not all require 24 - hour care			1
an inquiry by the @entity75 on @entity7 ’s along with @entity7 ’s @entity71 found patients with long - term illnesses were being unfairly refused funding			1
some trusts have slashed three quarters of their continuing healthcare budgets , while families of ill and vulnerable patients have had to sell their houses to pay for care the inquiry ’s @entity85 to care report found they were subjected to endless assessments and deferrals , meaning the application process dragged on for months or even years			1
many gave up because the process had gone on for so long or their relative had died			0
patients were assessed by a ‘ tick - box ’ list , and six in ten decisions were made without consulting a specialist in the patient ’s condition			0
in one case a patient who had been deemed eligible for funding had it withdrawn after they became bed - bound – as assessors said this meant they were less likely to fall			0
in some cases families were quizzed about their finances instead of their relative ’s care needs			2
@entity7 ’s nurse @entity113 told the inquiry : ‘ the process is intimidating , humiliating , unfriendly , exhausting , degrading , aggressive , frustrating and adversarial			0
’ @entity116 , of @entity47 , said : ‘ it ’s a disgrace that people are dying while waiting for the funding they ’re entitled to			2
’ an @entity13 spokesman said it tries to ensure those eligible ‘ receive appropriate care and support ’			1
@entity125 's family were owed £ 18,000 for his care by their local health trust , but only got £ 4,000 after they agreed to strike a deal when @entity125 ’s health declined rapidly , he needed round - the - clock nursing care			0
the pensioner , then 82 , was bed - bound with @entity7 ’s and should have been entitled to @entity13 continuing healthcare			1
but his wife @entity136 and son @entity137 became locked in a battle with their health authority			0
in at least three cycles of assessments and meetings , they were repeatedly assured he was eligible , only to be told by separate panels that they needed to provide more information			0
all the while , mrs @entity125 , who is now 78 , was paying around £ 1,600 a month from the couple ’s savings for her husband ’s nursing home fees			0
mr @entity153 died , aged 83 , in march 2011 ‘ without a penny ’ having been provided by his local health authority in east @entity156			0
@entity137 , 40 , offered to abandon his claim for the full cost of care – around £ 18,000 – if they would pay for the final 12 weeks			2
‘ they agreed straight away , ’ he said			0
the authority refunded the family just over £ 4,000 .			0

families of those with degenerative diseases can apply for care funding
' continuing healthcare ' money is to cover *expenses* such as care homes
there are currently 59,000 carers who claim it across the @entity71
but charities think there are another 60,000 who should get it but do *n't*
@entity13 trusts blamed for not making funds available or not informing people
experts are now calling for a complete overhaul of the system
