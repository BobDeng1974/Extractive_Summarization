by @entity0 published : 22:44 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 07:47 est , 1 october 2013 speaker @entity1 has taken a shot at president @entity3 tonight as he gave an impression of his @entity6 rival while on the @entity8 floor last night			1
president @entity3 used a press conference on monday evening to reiterate that he will not be having any conversations that tie the implementation of the @entity12 to the annual budget			1
@entity1 jokingly echoed that sentiment on the @entity8 floor , saying : ' i talked to the president earlier tonight : i 'm not going to negotiate			1
i 'm not going to negotiate			0
i 'm not going to negotiate			0
' ' i did n't come here to shut down the government			0
@entity1 's press secretary @entity34 posted a photo of his boss on the phone with the president at around 8.30pm on monday			2
that phone call may have been too little too late as the midnight shutdown is seemingly inevitable			2
finally : the president spoke to @entity1 for the first time all week on monday evening , hours before the shutdown finally went into effect president @entity3 has made it clear that he views the @entity44 @entity8 members as part of the problem as they are using the budget as a way to gut his health care agenda			1
during his press conference on monday , @entity3 gave a stern lecture slamming republicans for trying to ' extract a ransom ' at federal workers ' expense			0
' one faction of one party in one house of @entity59 in one branch of government does n't get to shut down the entire government just to re-fight the results of an election , ' he said .			0

*surprising* dig came as @entity44 @entity8 speaker @entity1 was addressing the @entity68 before the shutdown
spoke to the president for the first time in a week on monday evening
