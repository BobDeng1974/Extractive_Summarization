@entity0 was in a cantankerous mood as he broke his self - imposed silence after avoiding media responsibilities for the last ten days			1
@entity0 was speaking publicly for the first time since being fined £ 25,000 by the @entity5 for saying there was a ‘ clear campaign ’ by referees against @entity9			1
he said he was only attending the press conference to preview his side ’s match at @entity13 tomorrow because he had to			1
‘ you know why i 'm here , so you can not expect that i 'm super happy to be here , ’ he said			1
asked why he did n’t speak to the media before @entity9 ’s 1 - 1 draw with title rivals @entity19 , @entity0 said : ‘ because , if you want , you can make a silence very noisy			1
@entity0 spoke to press on friday ahead of @entity9 's trip to @entity13 @entity9 manager @entity0 was in a cantankerous mood as he broke his self - imposed silence @entity0 was speaking publicly for the first time since being fined £ 25,000 by the @entity5 @entity0 insisted that @entity23 ( left ) was not a panic buy , but a reaction to @entity27 's exit ‘ if i was a journalist , from silence i could make lots of words			1
’ in a thinly veiled criticism of the @entity32 and @entity5 , @entity0 referenced his touchline spat with @entity34 earlier this season			1
‘ the only surprise i had was not to be punished when i was pushed by another manager			1
apart from that , i can expect everything			1
’ asked if his new £ 27million signing @entity23 would make his debut against @entity13 , @entity0 jibed : ‘ i think he can , unless the @entity32 or @entity5 say some rule stops him			1
’ are you excited by @entity45 ? ' @entity46			1
' normal ? ' yeah			1
' what can he bring ? ' i do n't think it 's the best thing for him that i speak about expectations			1
he needs his time , as everyone does			1
he will have his time			2
it 's not a panic buy			1
it 's a reaction to @entity27 , a departure that is not a panic buy because he 's a player we 've known for a long , long time			1
' i 've coached in his league for two seasons			2
we are happy with our business			2
@entity27 is a player we like very , very much but the business was very good			2
we are happy with it			2
' any regret with @entity27 ? ' no. no. we are happy with what he gave us			2
we are happy with the investment we did on him , one and a half years ago			2
we are happy with the profit we made in this transfer window			2
hopefully we made him a better player			2
hopefully he can have success in the future because we like him very much			2
' you never seem to win at @entity81 ... why is this ? ' because the opponents score more goals than us , or sometimes the same number of goals			2
' they 're the team with the least goals , you 're the team with the most ... hot favourites ? ' i do n't have to speak about @entity13			1
' what did you learn from that defeat last year ? ' i learned nothing that i had n't learned before that			2
there are matches that are impossible to win and you have to be smart enough to understand that			2
@entity100 so many years in football , there are matches that i clearly know it 's impossible to win			1
' how many sides are there in the title race ? ' that 's not my problem			1
it 's up to the others to wonder whether they are title contenders or not			1
we consider we are , even if sometimes it 's more difficult that it might be			1
but we consider ourselves contenders			2
' team news ? ' @entity116 [ @entity117 ] is injured			1
the player [ @entity118 ] is suspended			1
' @entity119 ? ' i told you			2
@entity116 is injured and the player who is suspended is suspended			2
everybody ( else ) is fit			2
' where will @entity45 play in your team ? ' goalkeeper impossible because we do n't need him there			2
@entity131 defenders we do n't need , and he 's too small			1
after that he can play everywhere			2
' is he ready now ? ' i think he can , unless the @entity32 or @entity5 say some rule stops him			0
' can @entity135 come back ? ' he 's a @entity9 player who is on loan			1
when we sell the players , they 're not ours			0
but he is our player			0
' are you proud of the business you 've done in the last few windows ? ' that 's not my job at the club			1
you have to give credit to the people in the club who deal with numbers			0
they deserve credit for that			0
' does that game at @entity81 still rankle with you ? ' i do n't speak about it			1
i do n't have to speak about it			1
' @entity158 or @entity159 tomorrow ? ' yes			0
one ( of them )			0
' five points clear , @entity164 final , @entity162 last 16 , you should be enjoying it			0
you do n't appear to be ? is that fair ? ' i 'm enjoying my work with my players			0
when i like my players , when i like my squad , i 'm much more happy , more motivated to work , and this is the case			0
' it 's just when you speak to us ? ' speak to you ? you know why i 'm here , so you can not expect that i 'm super happy to be here			1
' so you 're here because you have to be here ? ' yes			0
' could @entity45 start ? or does he need a bit longer to settle down ? ' i 'm going to repeat the words i said three weeks ago , so many now people can understand			0
i said , he fits into the @entity188 and @entity189 's team			1
at this moment , he fits in @entity189 and @entity9 teams			1
' is he at the right physical level ? ' he trained just two days			0
i can not say much			0
the business situation almost to the last minute on monday , he had to go to @entity193 for visas and the legal situation on the tuesday			0
he only trained here a couple of days			0
i can not say much			0
' why did n't you speak to the media before @entity19 ? ' because , if you want , you can make a silence very noisy			1
it depends what you want to do			0
you could make noise with my silence , because you know the reason for my silence			0
if i was a journalist , from silence i could make lots of words			0
' all because of @entity118 's ban ? ' not just ( that )			1
' how do you reflect on that suspension ? ' i do n't reflect , because maybe i 'll be punished if i reflect			0
maybe they can read my reflection , and i do n't want that			0
' any word on @entity220 's progression ? ' good			1
' do you expect more from him still ? ' a kid of 20 , i expect always to improve			0
' are you pleased with your position ? ' i feel the distance could be much bigger			0
if i analysed – which i 'm not going to do – the last five , six , seven matches , we could , we should have a bigger difference			0
' why no new deal announced with hazard ? ' why should it be officialised ? why ? what 's the problem ? he has a contract with @entity9 for two or three more years			1
are you worried ? i 'm not worried			0
' @entity240 at 18 , now @entity220 at 20 with @entity9 ... are you impressed by both players , the future of the @entity244 team ? ' i think the @entity244 federation should write me a letter to thank me because i think they have now the two best young defenders in the world			1
not the two ' best ' , because they are young			0
there are final products , mature players of 25 , 28 , 30 years of age			0
but as young defenders , can you imagine what @entity220 and @entity240 could represent in a couple of years ? @entity258 [ @entity259 ] should be very happy with that			0
' do you expect to be fined by the @entity32 for not attending the media conferences ? ' you know , the only surprise i had in relation for that was not to be punished when i was pushed by another manager			1
apart from that , i can expect everything			0
' are you thinking about @entity270 ? ' no. three matches to play before that			0
i do n't have time			0
i have to prepare @entity13 , @entity274 and , after that , yes			0
after @entity274 i will prepare for @entity270			0
' how did @entity276 affect your life ? ' every experience you have in life helps you to be what you are			0
university was five years of my life			0
for sure , it made a contribution to what i am			0
i can not measure it			0
i ca n't say it 's more important than being a manager 's son , or more important than being an assistant to other managers			1
