by @entity0 @entity1 started viewing online pornography when he was a teenager and by the end of university was addicted to it @entity1 looks like any other young @entity7 guy			1
the 29 - year - old has a job in marketing in @entity10 , enjoys going out with friends and spending time in the outdoors			2
unlike many twenty - somethings , however , he has never had sex , never had a girlfriend , and has been to rehab – for his long - term addiction to pornography			1
@entity1 first saw pornography when he was 11 years old and a friend showed him one of his father 's magazines			2
about this age he also remembers watching sex scenes on late - night television and in movies			2
but it was when his parents had the internet installed in their house that what began as ' curiosity ' turned into a full - blown addiction			2
' it was something i did n't want to be doing but i was doing it anyway			0
even before i understood what an addiction was , that side of it meant it was an addiction for me , ' he told @entity42			2
' it was starting to take up large chunks of my time ; i was lying to people about what i was doing in my spare time			0
i 'd stay up viewing all night and go to work on an hour 's sleep , it was affecting my productivity , my health , my relationships and friendships , ' he said			1
' there were times i did n't turn up to people 's parties or i would n't go out , because i 'd been viewing all day , or i 'd think , i 'll just view one more thing before i leave			0
it 's a bit like when someone goes into a casino and they lose track of time and then they realise they 've been in there for a day			0
' @entity72 also sapped @entity1 's interest in finding a girlfriend			1
' i still had an interest in relationships but i did n't ever feel that massive pull to do anything about it , compared to now , where i feel , i 'd really like to have a relationship with someone , it 's almost like the motivation is n't there … i was less interested in putting in the effort required to love somebody , ' he said			1
@entity1 is one of the subjects speaking openly about the subject of pornography in an @entity92 documentary to be aired on wednesday			1
he joins with @entity10 couple @entity93 and @entity94 , whose relationship has been tested by @entity93 's sex addiction , and @entity97 and @entity98 , who perform webcam ' peep shows ' from their @entity102 home			1
@entity1 ( right ) now volunteers with an organisation that aims to raise awareness about the harmful effects of pornography before and after : ( left ) @entity1 at the snow before he went to rehab at the age of 25 ( right ) @entity109 after his stint in a rehab clinic for porn addiction the journalist behind the documentary , @entity115 , said he first got the idea of exploring the topic of pornography when he heard that a friend of a friend was going to rehab for an addiction to it			1
' i had no idea the situation got so bad , i saw all these stories in the media bout relationships being destroyed by porn addiction , i thought , i need to understand this better , ' he told @entity42			1
@entity115 talked to sex therapists and psychological experts in pornography addiction who likened the influence of pornography on relationships to ' a tsunami about to break ' and ' cancer '			1
but despite its far - reaching effects , says @entity115 , people often are still not willing to talk about pornography			0
' we found people in porn addiction groups , in marriage counselling , in rehab centres ; they were happy to talk but no one wanted to go on camera			1
there 's this massive shame and guilt about porn			2
' @entity1 , who is a @entity150 , said he felt a ' deep level of shame ' about his addiction and at the age of 25 , sick of being at the mercy of his addiction , @entity1 's friends suggested he go to a rehabilitation centre in @entity158			1
' it sounded pretty full on , but i was willing to do anything because i really wanted to stop , ' he said			0
@entity1 is one of the subjects of a documentary exploring sex and porn addiction , produced by @entity115 ( right )			1
other subjects include @entity98 ( left ) and @entity97 ( centre ) , who perform webcam ' peep shows ' from their home @entity1 's friends drove him out to the clinic and he spent six weeks at the clinic that catered to people with addictions of all kinds			1
' the hardest thing was seeing those guys drive away			0
a lot of emotions came out , i remember calling my parents and telling them where i was … that 's the day i felt myself hitting rock bottom and thinking : this is where it 's brought me			0
' the journey since rehab has been long and sometimes difficult			0
' i probably went in thinking , i 'll do six weeks here and it 'll be perfect , but that 's not how it works , ' he said			0
' i can see how much better my life is now – i 'm fitter , i 'm healthier , i 'm more connected with my friends , i feel better about myself			0
' where once he was not particularly interested in finding a girlfriend , he is now going on dates and has been interested in a couple of different women			0
@entity1 volunteers with @entity200 , an organisation that aims to raise awareness about the harmful effects of pornography , and @entity1 says he has to work at re-wiring his brain in some respects			1
' i 'm working on … appreciating women as friends , seeing them as a beautiful creation of @entity210			0
to treat them not as an object but as a living breathing person who deserves respect , ' he said			0
speaking to @entity42 the day before the documentary went to air he said he anticipated a ' sleepless night ' and said he was ' naturally nervous ' about airing his personal story on national television			2
' my aim for sharing is really so that other who are struggling will know that there is hope and there is help out there			0
