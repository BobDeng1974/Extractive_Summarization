by @entity0 published : 10:40 est , 9 september 2012 updated : 02:12 est , 10 september 2012 scientists will begin clinical trials in 12 months , using stem cells harvested from a blood sample from the patients scientists are working on a new weapon in the war against wrinkles			1
there are not many things women have not tried in the quest for a youthful complexion – from lotions and potions to @entity17 and cosmetic surgery			2
but a @entity20 firm is trialling a new method which involves injecting the patient ’s own stem cells to restore skin ’s youthful elasticity			1
researchers believe they will spur the growth of new skin cells , called fibroblasts , which make the elastic ingredient collagen which is produced in large quantities when we are young , but declines as we age			2
the company @entity33 , based in @entity34 , plan to begin clinical trials in 12 months , using stem cells harvested from a blood sample from the patients			1
they believe the procedure could be commercially available in just three years , potentially revolutionising the market for anti-ageing treatments			0
by using the body ’s own cells , it is billed as a more ‘ natural ’ approach to reducing the signs of ageing than @entity17 , a chemical which freezes the facial muscles to smooth wrinkles			0
they have licenced the technology to harvest a new type of stem cell – called a blastomere - like stem cell ( @entity56 ) – which is found circulating in the blood			0
like other types of stem cells , it is unspecialised and can develop into many other types of cell in the human body such as a liver , brain or skin cell			1
the advantage of this particular one it is available in very large doses from one blood sample			0
they hope to inject 500millon of the cells in the skin in one jab			2
@entity75 , the company ’s chief executive said : ‘ the skin has a natural elastic property which comes from cells known as fibroblasts			2
‘ the ability of the body to produce this elastic material slows down with age because the number of these fibroblasts decreases			0
‘ by introducing large numbers of stem cells into the right place , we are increasing the ability of the body to produce this natural material			1
it will be long lasting , we think at least five years if not longer			0
’ @entity33 will be carrying out the first trial on patients with a clinic in @entity96 to see if the treatment is safe to use			0
there are ‘ stem cell facelifts ’ already on the market which involve taking a fat sample from a patient – under local anaesthetic and injecting it into the face for around £ 7,500			1
but mr @entity75 said : ‘ the stem cells in fat are more mature so the quality is not so good , and the numbers of them in it are much smaller , around five or 10 million			1
‘ we are talking about 500 million , very high quality , pure stem cells and there is definitely a link between dose and efficacy			1
the more you have , the better it should be			0
’ these stem cells , discovered by researchers in the @entity121 around 10 years ago , are deployed by the body when there is a trauma in an organ			1
because they can turn into up to 50 types of other cells , @entity33 is investigating their uses against heart attacks , @entity130 , parkinson ’s disease and cancer			0
by turning them into skin cells , they could also be used against acne scars and stretch marks , he said			2
@entity138 , a plastic surgeon and president elect of the @entity141 , said it could be five to 10 years before stem cell treatments for wrinkles were widely available			0
he said : ‘ it is an exciting prospect as the science of stem cells will influence plastic surgery and cosmetic medicine significantly in the future .			1
