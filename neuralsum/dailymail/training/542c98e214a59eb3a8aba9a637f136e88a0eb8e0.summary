by @entity0 published : 11:09 est , 16 may 2012 updated : 01:42 est , 17 may 2012 bullish : @entity2 's chief adviser @entity1 has left @entity3 , but not before firing a broadside in frustration at the slow pace of @entity7 and welfare reforms a row has broken out between the head of the civil service and ministers over plans to reform @entity7 by slashing the number of public sector workers			1
sir @entity16 has publicly rejected suggestions by ministers that civil servants are ‘ lazy ’ and has hit back at reports that his staff will be cut by between 70 and 90 per cent			1
meanwhile , a meeting between the mandarin and @entity2 ’s policy adviser @entity1 ended in mr @entity1 storming out in apparent frustration			1
revealing his thoughts on @entity29 last week , sir @entity16 described a meeting with @entity32 staff , saying : ‘ really enjoyed talking to @entity34 staff yesterday			1
lots of good , challenging questions			0
rebutted recent rubbish about “ lazy ” civil servants			0
’ he added : ‘ for the avoidance of doubt there are absolutely no plans to cut the civil service by either 70 or 90 per cent			0
’ it followed his heated row last month with mr @entity1 , who will soon be leaving his post to move to @entity46 , over @entity7 reforms including staff numbers and plans to introduce some fixed - term contracts			1
mr @entity1 , who is reported to want to see the number of civil servants reduced by 90 per cent , was so frustrated he stormed out			1
he and others at the heart of @entity55 blame the civil service for resisting many of the @entity58 ’ more radical reforms – including the sacking of poor performers and fast - tracking of high fliers			2
@entity3 now wants to bypass senior civil servants when it comes up with new policy ideas to prevent them being lost in the @entity7 machine			0
on sabbatical : mr @entity1 , who has worked closely with mr @entity2 for more than five years , is heading to @entity46 this week to study how governance can be improved ministers have grown increasingly angry at a culture which sees civil servants holding on to their jobs , along with generous salaries , flexible hours and pension perks			1
the overhaul of @entity77 ’s army of @entity7 bureaucrats will be unveiled in the next month			0
ministers have been asked whether they could run their departments with as little as a third of their current staff			0
@entity3 wants them to produce detailed reports on the impact of a ‘ radical ’ reduction in numbers			0
the government is also drawing up plans to bring in more workers from the private sector to formulate policy			0
sources have revealed that under the outsourcing scheme , departments would commission consultancies , charities or think - tanks to draw up policy			2
barriers : @entity101 , sir @entity16 ( left ) , and new cabinet secretary , sir @entity103 ( right ) , have both been resisting mr @entity1 's radical reforms , much to his frustration the shake - up could also see civil servants ranked according to their ability			1
and cabinet office minister @entity109 is being encouraged by colleagues to put permanent secretaries on fixed - term contracts to make them more accountable			2
but sir @entity16 , who is also permanent secretary at the @entity114 , told mr @entity1 that talk of shrinking their numbers was ‘ flipping nonsense ’			1
the radical measures will infuriate public sector unions , who staged another day of industrial action last week			2
strategist : mr @entity1 is moving to @entity46 with his wife , where he will take up a teaching post and learn about better governance at @entity128 in a further sign of tension , @entity129 , the senior civil servant in charge of the @entity132 ’s @entity7 cost - cutting drive , has announced he is resigning to spend more time with his family			1
his surprise announcement came after it emerged that the @entity138 , which he established , has cost taxpayers £ 60million in just two years			2
mr @entity129 , who was put in charge of finding billions of pounds of efficiency savings soon after the @entity132 was formed in 2010 , will quit at the end of june to focus on non-executive and ‘ spousal roles ’ in support of his wife , who has recently become a vicar			0
there are 434,000 civil servants , the lowest number since the @entity150 and down from more than 500,000 at the time of the 2010 general election .			0
