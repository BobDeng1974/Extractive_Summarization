by @entity0 published : 04:13 est , 25 september 2012 updated : 07:50 est , 25 september 2012 at school , @entity1 was called ' cancer face ' for wearing a wig to hide her bald patches			1
and for over two decades she has allowed everyone to believe she has alopecia , the auto immune condition that causes hair to fall out on its own			2
but now , in the wake of @entity11 , the 32 - year - old mother - of - one from @entity13 has bravely revealed she has been pulling out her own hair since she was a child , the result of a little - understood psychological condition called trichotillomania			1
@entity1 , aged 11 , when she first began pulling out her hair and was left with a bald patch , left , and wearing the wig her mother bought her to stop the school bullies , right			1
bald areas of @entity1 's scalp that wo n't ever grow back because of the pulling			1
tormented by the condition since she was a child , @entity1 has , at various stages in her life , been left almost completely bald			1
when , age 11 , having removed most of her hair over the course of a single summer , she returned to school wearing a wig , cruel classmates soon subjected her to relentless bullying			2
but still @entity1 refused to reveal the truth about her condition , believing no one would be sympathetic to the compulsion which has blighted her life ever since			1
@entity1 is now 32 but there are some sections of her hair that will never grow back			1
she said : ' hair pulling has been at the root of all my problems throughout my life			0
it 's made me depressed and turned me into a recluse			0
' it 's made me very antisocial and i ca n't hold down a relationship			0
i just want what everyone else has , to have a job and a partner and normal things but i feel trapped in my own head			0
' @entity1 's trichotillomania ( @entity58 ) began one day at age 11 when , during a class at school , she says she went into ' a kind of trance ' and when she looked down at her exercise book , it was covered in handfuls of hair			1
@entity1 - pictured , left , with her daughter @entity68 , six - says her secret obsession has got in the way of her enjoying a normal life			1
@entity1 with her daughter @entity68 and , from left to right , her brothers @entity72 and @entity74			1
she said : ' i did n’t even realise i 'd been doing it but i remember that day specifically because i was shocked at the amount of hair that i had pulled out			0
' after that , i did it all the time			0
the summer came and i was pulling every day until i had a huge bald patch on the top of my head			2
' i hid it from my mother under a baseball cap but eventually she spotted it and she took me to a doctor who said i had alopecia			0
' i thought , " okay , i have alopecia			0
that 's what i will tell people " , even though i knew i was doing it to myself i let everyone believe that was the case			0
@entity95 was a real thing and it was accepted			0
' @entity1 , aged 11 , when the pulling began , left , and in happier times when the condition was less severe , right			1
by the end of that summer @entity1 had barely any hair left on my head			1
due to start secondary school , she was terrified she would be bullied for being bald			1
' in the end my mother went out and spent her last £ 50 on a hairpiece for me , ' she said			0
' it was all she could afford and it fooled no one			0
' but instead of being bullied for being bald , i was tormented for wearing a wig			2
' @entity1 's early school days were filled with a barrage of abuse from her fellow students for her lack of hair			1
they questioned why she needed a wig and soon a rumour spread around her school that she had lost her hair through cancer treatment			1
before long , @entity1 became introverted and isolated by the constant jibes			1
@entity1 , left , having just given birth to @entity68 , and right , using a clip to hide the fact she was wearing a wig			1
@entity1 , who has a six - year - old daughter , @entity68 , said : ' i was mortified about going to school wearing a wig but i did n’t want anyone to see what was underneath			1
' people would point out that my hair did n’t look real and i tried to shy away from their comments			0
' a couple of girls started bringing a camera to school in order to take pictures of me while i was sat in the playground			2
' the cancer rumour started around the same time and i remember being cornered while a group of them taunted me , calling me " cancer face "			1
' the bullying continued until @entity1 left school but still she could not resist the impulse to pull out her hair			1
eventually , she managed to grow an inch of hair all over her head and gave up her wig			0
but in resisting to pull , she found herself self - harming with scissors , knives and compasses			2
@entity1 and her friend @entity156 who has helped her through tough times			1
@entity1 said : ' i blocked out a lot of that time in my life because it hurts too much to remember it			1
' by the time i left school i had made a really good friend and she helped me through things			1
' at 18 , @entity1 began a business administration course and moved out of the family home to live with a boyfriend			1
but while on the surface she seemed happier , @entity1 was still battling with her secret obsession			1
@entity1 said the hair - pulling would worsen whenever she felt depressed or upset and sometimes she would be left with such massive bald patches she would be forced to wear hairpieces again			1
@entity1 enjoying life when the trichotillomania was less severe			1
she said : ' i always made sure i never plucked from the front of my head so i could wear a wig and then clip the fringe over it to make it look like i had a natural hairline			0
' when i split up with my boyfriend it got so much worse and i would have to hide it from everyone			0
' the only time i 've ever managed to stop pulling was when i was pregnant			0
i felt so ill throughout the pregnancy i literally did n't have the time to think about it			0
' when my daughter was born was the only time since i was 11 when i 've had a full head of hair			0
' two years ago @entity1 stumbled across a video on @entity193 made by a young girl with @entity58 , and was shocked to discover that her compulsion had a name			1
until that time she had never dared tell anyone about her secret shame , and until today has only shared her condition with her closest friends			2
she said : ' i could n't believe it when i saw this video made by a girl who had trichotillomania			2
' my condition was a real thing with a name and i just burst into tears to discover there were others out there like me			2
' until that point i had always believed it was this disgusting thing that only i did and that no one could ever possibly understand			0
' @entity1 previously worked as a care worker , but has been unable to work for the last eight years due to her anxiety and depression issues			1
now her hair - pulling has improved , and for the last two years she has avoided pulling from the hair on her head			2
however , years of yanking out her hair have damaged the follicles in her scalp , and @entity1 has been left with large bald patches which are unlikely to grow back			1
@entity225 result , @entity1 dyes her hair and scalp black to hide the thinning areas and always wears her hair scraped back to cover up the worst areas			2
she is currently on a long waiting list to receive cognitive behavioural therapy , which she believes will help her problems			0
@entity1 said : ' now i only pull from the hair on my arms and legs			2
it relieves the tension but it does n't give me the same satisfaction			0
' whenever i tell people about my @entity58 they always say , " well , just stop doing it " , but it ’s an urge i have no control over			0
' i find myself doing it more when i 'm stressed and when i 'm sat watching tv i find it 's best to keep my hands busy as i often do n't realise i 'm doing it until they are filled with clumps of hair			0
' @entity253 star @entity252 revealed she lost her eyelashes to @entity58			0
@entity252 , from @entity253 , recently revealed that she lost her eyelashes due to @entity58 , and it is thought that around four per cent of the population will experience compulsive hair pulling at some point in their lives			0
women seem more prone than males , with pulling usually starting around age 12 , but it can start later in life too			0
@entity1 has found some support through social networking groups and says that simply knowing there are other sufferers out there has given her a great deal of comfort			2
but she hopes to finally rid herself of the condition for the sake of her daughter			2
she said : ' i have always been very careful not to do it in front of @entity68 , but i would hate it if she ever thought it was normal			0
' i can never take her swimming because i ’m terrified of getting my hair wet and showing my bald patches			2
' i would love nothing more than to feel beautiful , have a relationship and give her the family life she deserves - but up until now @entity58 has held me back			0
' hopefully , if i get some treatment , that will finally change			0
