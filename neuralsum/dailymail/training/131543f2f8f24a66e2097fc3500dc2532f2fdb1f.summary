@entity1 's unrelenting headaches left her in agony , and she was actually relieved when doctors diagnosed her with a brain tumour			1
but the relief was short - lived			0
the 56 - year - old from @entity7 , @entity8 , was soon told removing the tumour would involve invasive surgery that could leave her blind or brain damaged			1
unsure if she wanted to take the risk , she began researching her options online , and found a way of removing the tumour without cutting open the head : accessing the brain through the eyelid			1
the procedure , performed by a small number of highly specialised surgical teams , involves making a small incision in the crease of the eye			2
this allows doctors to go past the eyeball and get into the hard - to - reach centre of the head			1
@entity1 was suffering unrelenting headaches , but doctors said the only way to remove the tumour that was causing them was to cut open her skull and get past her brain , risking blindness and brain damage			1
she found another way to access the tumour : through the eyelid			1
she is pictured with a 3d model of her skull less invasive brain surgery is currently not common , but some surgeons are developing different ways to be able to access tumours , aneurysms and other problems without the trauma of cutting open the head , in the hope that patients will recover faster as a result			1
ms @entity1 was diagnosed with a meningioma - a benign tumor that started in the brain 's protective covering and grew into the bone and near her optic nerve – behind her left eye			1
reaching this spot - above and behind the eyes , the underside of the brain - is a surgical challenge			2
traditional surgery means making a large opening in the skull to give doctors plenty of room to manoeuvre			1
but they must move painstakingly past sections of healthy brain			1
ms @entity1 was warned that because her tumour was in such a tough location , vision or even cognitive damage was a risk of the top - down surgery			1
sometimes , surgeons can snake their tools through the passages in the nose instead , which gives them a straighter shot through a natural opening			0
now the eye is offering some paths into this difficult region , too			0
one location where the surgery is performed is the @entity90 's @entity91			2
dr @entity92 , director of the centre , said the eye socket is like an ice cream cone , with the tip pointing back towards the brain 's centre			2
accessing the brain through the eye , known as a ' transorbital ' approach , is now being performed by a small number of highly specialised surgical teams			2
it involves making a small incision in the crease of the eye , allowing doctors to go past the eyeball and get into the hard - to - reach center of the head			1
they remove a bit of bone about the size of two postage stamps from the inside of the eye socket			2
entering the socket at a different angle , doctors also can make a cut in the crow 's feet at the corner of the eye			2
or they can hide an incision in the eyebrow , making a small hole in the skull just above the eye			2
it is hoped that patients will recover faster than open surgery , in which doctors cut open the skull and have to get past parts of the brain , risking damage			1
entering through the eyelid crease , surgeons can follow that cone to just the right spot to access the brain - removing a bit of bone about the size of two postage stamps from the inside			1
entering the socket at a different angle , doctors also can make a cut in the crow 's feet at the corner of the eye			0
or they can hide an incision in the eyebrow , making a small hole in the skull just above the eye			0
dr @entity153 , president of the @entity154 , cautioned that accessing the brain through the eye , known as a ' transorbital ' approach , has n't been formally studied			0
so outcomes such as safety can not be compared to traditional open surgery , which makes a large opening in the skull			1
@entity164 approaches are worth exploring , he said			0
but , ' because it 's new does n't mean it 's necessarily better			0
' dr @entity167 , a @entity168 neurosurgeon who co-authored one of the first medical journal reports on the eyelid method a few years ago stressed that this type of surgery is only suitable for carefully selected patients			1
the tumour can not be too big ; no important nerves can be in the way and the person can not have too large sinuses as this would mean doctors would not have enough room to get to the brain through the eye			1
he said the operation 's main risk is infection , and added that the procedure can only be done by a specialized team with experience in both the eye and the brain			2
dr @entity194 , @entity195 's director of orbital and oculoplastic surgery , has the job of protecting the eyeball , making the corridor for the neurosurgeons to work			0
to access tumours in the hard to reach underside of the brain , doctors can make a small incision in the eyelid , allowing them to go past the eyeball and access the brain behind the eyes			1
they remove a bit of bone about the size of two postage stamps from the inside of the eye socket those kinds of multidisciplinary teams are rare , limiting wider adoption of these techniques , said dr @entity167			0
' you really have to learn how to be co-captains			0
medicine and surgery has n't been , traditionally , like that , ' he said			0
@entity1 believes patients should be informed about alternative options like the eyelid approach – rather than being told open surgery is their only option			1
she knew medical centers often offer second - opinion consultations for long - distance patients , and started hunting — aided when her husband used a 3d printer to create a life - size model of her skull with her tumor for surgeons to examine			0
' the sad thing is that people do n't know there are other options than what their small - town doctor is telling them , ' she said			0
' i feel like a walking miracle			0
' she had to travel 2,580 miles from her home in @entity8 to @entity250 for the procedure			0
but after having the operation , she awoke with essentially a black eye , and was back at work in her psychotherapy practice in two weeks , wearing sunglasses			0
doctors warn the surgery , known as transoptical surgery , is not suitable for everyone and should be carried out by specialist teams of brain and eye specialists in @entity266 , dentist @entity265 underwent a similar months - long search to treat a meningioma growing around critical nerves and blood vessels , threatening her vision and motor function			1
she wanted both a brain and an eye specialist			0
so she read medical journals online and hunted designated ' centers of excellence			0
' dr @entity92 initially planned to cut through the side of her skull , a smaller operation than other doctors offered , but later decided the corner of her eye offered a good path			2
ms @entity265 said it took twice as long as regular surgery , but she was discharged in four days pain - free			0
' people need help to try to get connected more quickly , and to know what those options are , ' she said .			0

@entity1 , 56 , had a brain tumour which caused unrelenting headaches
doctors said surgery to remove the tumour could damage her brain
they would need to get past parts of the brain to access the tumour
she discovered another procedure where doctors go through the eyelid
this allows them to access the brain without cutting open the skull
