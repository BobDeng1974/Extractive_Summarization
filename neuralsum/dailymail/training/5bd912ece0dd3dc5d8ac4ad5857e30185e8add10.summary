@entity0 says @entity1 have to get nasty if they ’re to avoid a repeat of last season ’s struggle			1
the @entity1 have yet to win in the @entity5 this season and were knocked out of the @entity7 by @entity8 on tuesday			1
@entity10 ’s team are only outside the relegation zone – where they resided for much of the last campaign – by virtue of goal difference and take on fifth - placed @entity15 at the @entity16 on saturday			1
@entity0 scored for @entity1 on tuesday and says the @entity1 need to get nastier as a team @entity0 's goal was his first in 30 matches , and only his third since joining the club last summer @entity0 broke a 30 - match goal drought against @entity8 and the @entity24 striker could now keep his place for the visit of the @entity27			1
and the £ 6.5million frontman – criticised having scored just twice in over a year – believes @entity1 have been too soft in front of goal			1
‘ we need to be tougher , ’ he said			2
‘ it is too easy sometimes			0
all of us , strikers , everyone , have to be nastier and make sure when people play us they have to really work for it			0
the @entity24 striker is determined to help @entity1 avoid another relegation scrap like last season ‘ there is room for improvement			1
we have to play better and we have to get the first win			0
‘ we do n't want the shadows of last season following us around this season			2
we have had a decent start and now with the home schedule we have we have to take three points			0
‘ @entity15 are a team you look at			1
they have built something , they stay consistent and their identity shows			0
we have to all come together at @entity1 and make that happen			2
’ meanwhile , former @entity56 winger @entity55 could find himself out of the side this weekend after an indifferent start to the season			2
manager @entity10 has been left frustrated by his side 's winless start to the @entity5 campaign @entity55 has started the season poorly and could be dropped on saturday for the visit of @entity15 winger @entity65 , signed for £ 2.5million from @entity66 this summer , could replace @entity55 for the match @entity10 has promised £ 2.5m wideman @entity65 a start against @entity15 and @entity55 , who lost possession in the build up to @entity8 ’s winner during the week , is under threat			1
and @entity65 said : ‘ it ( @entity10 ’s promise ) was good to hear personally			0
‘ obviously i 've come here and i want to play			0
i 've been bought to produce			0
@entity15 have made a very impressive start to the season , with @entity78 in excellent form the @entity27 are fifth in the @entity5 and beat @entity80 3 - 0 on tuesday in the @entity7 ‘ hopefully i can get minutes in the @entity5 to show that			1
all the players who have n't been playing are eager to play			0
‘ but we definitely need to win at least one of these two ( at home to @entity15 and then @entity8 )			1
‘ it ’s not been a bad start to the season but we have to get off the mark as quickly as possible			2
‘ and getting that first league win will give everyone a big confidence boost			0
