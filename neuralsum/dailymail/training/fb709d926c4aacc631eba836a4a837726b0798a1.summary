the use of surnames was largely unheard of in @entity10 prior to the 11th century , but as people began to need to be identified for reasons such as paying taxes they became increasingly prevalent			1
lexicographers @entity15 and @entity17 have revealed where many @entity10 family names originated from in their book @entity21			1
for example , in a town or village where many people shared the same first name , individuals might have started to be known by another characteristic			2
according to the book , which examines more than 100,000 last names , the name @entity53 related to a short man , @entity55 - a person with red hair , or a ruddy complexion , @entity26 - a fast person , and @entity61 someone with a cheerful disposition			1
the name game : the surname @entity65 , as used by actor @entity66 , referred to a person who was bold or fierce , and @entity69 's surname denoted someone who was bellicose , or inclined to fight @entity71 short man @entity73 - someone with a fair or lovely face @entity31 - someone with blond hair @entity76 - someone living in a clergy house @entity69 - a bellicose person cruise - bold or fierce @entity81 - a lazy man @entity83 - a nickname meaning stag @entity85 - someone with beautiful , long hair foot - someone with a foot deformity @entity89 nickname from a small fish @entity92 - a nickname from lou , meaning wolf ; @entity95 , @entity96 - a new arrival in a place @entity99 â€” someone who had been on a pilgrimage to the @entity102 read - a person with red hair or a ruddy complexion @entity106 - a wild or uncouth person ; @entity26 - a fast runner @entity109 - an ill mannered person @entity111 thin person @entity61 - a cheerful person ( from enveisie , meaning playful , merry ) @entity115 - willed or brave the surname @entity65 , as used by actor @entity66 - who has dropped part of his surname @entity119 - referred to a person who was bold or fierce , while actress @entity31 may be descended from someone known for his blond hair			1
someone who stayed at home might be known by the house where he lived , while someone who travelled from another town or country could be referred to denoting the place where they had come from			2

however , as families became increasingly stable , names started to be handed down through generations , with wives adopting her husband 's family name , and children taking theirs from their fathers			1
' the phenomenon of the modern family name is , broadly , of medieval @entity10 origin and is associated with the rise of bureaucracies , ' said mr @entity15			2
' tax collectors , beadles and bailiffs , sheriffs and reeves ( officers of law enforcement and the courts ) had , like their modern counterparts , a particular need for the precise identification of individuals			0

' even in cases where surnames had been based on a negative nickname , once the monikers were put on record they were very rarely changed .			0
