by @entity0 @entity3 police are to hunt for the ‘ mr @entity4 ’ running @entity6 gangs that are now behind more than 90 per cent of cashpoint thefts in this country , the @entity1 can reveal			1
officers will work with their @entity6 counterparts to target the gangsters orchestrating the crimes which are netting an estimated £ 40 million a year			1
new figures reveal a sharp rise in the crimes by @entity6 gangs and there are fears this will rise further with a new wave of immigrants expected to arrive in the @entity3 from january			1
@entity3 police are working with @entity6 officials to track down the masterminds behind £ 40million worth of cashpoint fraud per year in the @entity3 ( file picture ) in the first six months of this year , fraud from ‘ skimmed ’ or ‘ cloned ’ cards rose 15 per cent to £ 23.2 million , compared to £ 20.2 million the same period in 2012			1
@entity3 cash machine fraud also rose by 11 per cent ( corr ) to £ 16.2 million in the first half of 2013 , compared to £ 14.6 million in the first six months of 2012			1
earlier this year it emerged that the number of thefts related to @entity32 has trebled			0
there were some 7,572 cash machine card thefts in the first four months of the year , up from 2,553 during the same period in 2012			0
police intelligence suggests 92 per cent are linked to @entity6 immigrants already in the @entity3			1
the losses suffered as a result of @entity32 thefts run into many millions of pounds , sources said			0
the @entity1 can reveal a major operation involving @entity3 and @entity6 police is under way to identify the gangs behind the crime wave			1
@entity3 detectives believe several ‘ top level ’ gangsters , based in @entity6 , are orchestrating the misery being inflicted on @entity3 card users			1
techniques such as skimming involve putting a reader over the card slot then collecting data as the card enters the machine senior @entity59 figures are said to be ‘ nervous ’ about the crime surge			0
detectives fear some criminals will be among the @entity6 who will be entitled to settle in the @entity3 when border controls are dropped in the @entity64			1
they will join scores of @entity6 thieves and fraudsters already established here and who now , according to well - placed sources , dominate certain categories of card crime			2
a spokesman for the @entity74 at @entity75 told the @entity1 yesterday that the £ 23.2million losses in counterfeit fraud includes all fraud perpetrated as a result of @entity3 cards being copied			1
much of this fraud takes place in countries outside the @entity3 that have not fully implemented chip and pin , he said			2
the £ 16.2million lost through @entity3 cash machine fraud is where the compromised card is used at a @entity3 cash machine irrespective of how the card is compromised and so includes use of lost / stolen cards , counterfeit cards and cards ‘ intercepted in transit ’ , he added			1
the spokesman added : ‘ overall levels of card fraud have dropped by 29 % since a peak in 2008			0
with the introduction of enhanced security features , such as @entity103 , criminals have resorted to deception thefts			0
' these basic techniques include shoulder - surfing and distraction thefts at @entity32 - resulting in an increase in incidents at cash machines - which our unit is tackling head on			0
’ asked to comment on reports that @entity6 criminals are responsible for more than 90 per cent of @entity32 thefts , he said : ‘ that figure relates to police intelligence from 2010 , however the @entity74 and @entity119 remains focussed on the involvement of @entity6 criminal gangs in @entity32 crime , amongst other threats to the payment industry from organised crime			1
’ the latest annual figures show that , in 2012 , the top five countries for fraudulent activity on @entity3 issued cards were @entity130 ( £ 23.4m ) , @entity131 ( £ 7.9m ) , @entity132 ( £ 6.9m ) , @entity133 ( £ 5.4m ) and @entity134 ( £ 5.2m )			1
the @entity74 spokesman said officers are currently working on an 18 month project which is funded in the main by the @entity138 and will be focusing on @entity6 organised criminality targeting the @entity3 payments industry			1
‘ for operational reasons there are no further details we can release at this time , ’ he said			0
the @entity1 has learned that officers have identified a number of ‘ mr @entity4 ’ in the @entity6 city of @entity147			0
a source said : ‘ they are very clever criminals who have made vast sums of money out of card crime in the @entity3 , but who are difficult to pin down			0
’ gang members working for the crime barons will typically crowd customers withdrawing cash to read their four - digit pin , then distract them to steal the card			0
in some cases they install a simple metal sleeve in the slot which means the card is not returned to the user			0
someone reads the pin over the victim ’s shoulder and then , when they have moved away , retrieves the card			0
once the thieves have the card and pin they can go on a shopping spree or use a hole in the wall machine to empty their victim ’s account			0
another technique , shoulder surfing , involves distracting a user while another person takes their details ( posed by models ) last month @entity185 revealed that policemen from @entity6 and @entity187 are being drafted in to help @entity3 forces combat an eastern @entity190 crime wave			1
@entity192 chiefs have recruited the officers , who have flown to the capital for a two - year ‘ tour of duty ’ to help identify and deport overseas offenders			0
the special squad , comprising eight detectives from @entity6 and three officers from @entity187 , will join the @entity192 on raids , interviews and working in custody suites to crosscheck records with their own police database			1
the unprecedented move comes after it emerged last year that 28 per cent of the 300,000 suspects the @entity192 arrests each year were foreign nationals , with @entity187 and @entity6 at the top of the list			1
more than 27,000 @entity6 citizens have been held for serious offences in @entity212 in the past five years , including ten for murder , 142 for rape and 666 for other sex offences			0
the number of @entity6 arrested is second only to that of @entity187 , 34,905 of whom have been detained since 2008 , including 84 for murder			0
police hope that the new unit will disrupt major organised criminal networks including the fraud gangs originating from @entity147			2
last month it was revealed that fraud losses on @entity3 credit and debit cards have risen by 17pc in a year as criminals , struggling against improving technology , turn to new forms of “ low - tech ” scams			2
some £ 216.1 million worth of card frauds were committed in the first six months of this year , according to @entity234 , which prevents crime on behalf of the financial services industry			2
the total cost of fraud on debit and credit cards leapt 14 per cent last year , by £ 47 million to £ 388 million			2
fraud is expected to top £ 400 million this year			2
in 2008 @entity6 fraudster @entity242 , was jailed for five years after he was convicted of cloning more than 2,000 cards , which allowed him to steal up to £ 1.1million			2
police found photographs that showed his young son rolling around in a mountain of stolen cash .			0

@entity3 and @entity6 police are working to bring down cashpoint fraud
around £ 40million worth is though to be committed per year in the @entity3
around 90 per cent of it is organised by @entity6 gangs according to police figures
