by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:00 est , 19 january 2013 updated : 17:00 est , 19 january 2013 @entity0 and @entity3 ’s new book , @entity4 , takes a rosé - tinted look at leafy suburbia and what makes it tick			1
here ’s a selection of their affectionate observations			1
@entity13 : their products are found throughout middle class homes			1
a perfect combination of design and fun ( or irritating cuteness and uselessness , if you ’re in a bad mood ) , they prove that a shopper and his money are soon parted			1
boutique hotels : it is no longer @entity30 to stay in a hotel ; we should use only boutique hotels			1
there is no difference , apart from the price and the fact that the bath is often to be found in the middle of the room			1
@entity30 kitchen : an @entity13 kettle is stylish and ( that ever - present middle class word - of - approval ) ' fun ' @entity43 is for			1
corduroy : @entity47 , linen and corduroy : the @entity50 ( if you wear them too much ) @entity52 fabrics			1
you can tell from the clientele ’s cord count if a pub is safe to enter			1
design : there is a lot of uncomfortable designer furniture available			1
if your guests complain of bad backs , tell them the name of the designer and they ’ll be so impressed they will quite forget their distress			1
@entity68 : the @entity30 try to do their bit by eating leftovers , watching documentaries about polar bears and driving diesel cars , but if they truly want to save the planet they know they should stop having children , strap windmills to their chimneys and use bicycles			1
but then they would n’t feel @entity30 any more			1
fun : the more a @entity30 person assures you something will be fun , the more you know it probably wo n’t			1
‘ let ’s walk the seven peaks ! come on , it ’ll be fun ! ’ fun is our rallying cry : ‘ look at my new hat , i thought it was rather fun ! ’ ‘ oh yes ! what fun ! ’ ( what you ’re both actually saying is that it ’s ghastly			1
@entity106 : once a year all the animals that have n’t been shot are brought together to celebrate the fact			1
the @entity106 slogan is ‘ four legs good , 4x4s even better			1
’ @entity111 , right , left : although all the @entity112 do it , getting the continental kissing greeting right is tough @entity115 is for			1
hoodies : if their hooded garments are either handknitted or made from cashmere , hoodies could be @entity30			1
and if their flick - knives turn out to be @entity122 penknives , they are definitely @entity30			1
@entity124 : thanks to cricket and the tv adaptation of @entity128 , @entity124 is held affectionately in @entity30 hearts			1
few are brave enough to actually visit it , but we are now paying the ultimate @entity30 compliment : naming our offspring after it			1
@entity136 : the smallest of the @entity30 dogs and by far the most trouble			2
most @entity30 owners acquire one only to make their children look better behaved			2
seal of approval : a pair of corduroys @entity144 is for			2
knocking through : one of the most important signs of being @entity30 , but the problem nowadays is that the house you have just bought has already been knocked through			2
labrador : the winner of the ‘ @entity152 ’ category at every year ’s @entity154			2
my : the ultimate accolade the @entity30 can bestow on a tradesman , as in ‘ my plumber ’ or ‘ my electrician ’			2
@entity162 : if your middle class credentials are ever questioned , a hearty panful of this soon silences doubters			2
making it ticks so many middle class boxes : it is weeding with a purpose , organic , and it involves foraging			2
overdrafts : it ’s what sets us apart from @entity178 , who love to talk about how much money they have			2
we like to talk about how much money we have n’t			2
@entity182 : for years the @entity30 assumed it was some kind of exotic dust , a flamboyant sprinkle of which over a spag bol bestowed the finishing touch			2
then someone went to @entity189 and discovered it was cheese			2
it was instantly rebranded @entity182 , quadrupled in price and we had to grate it ourselves			0
queuing ( and @entity195 ) : the @entity30 are good at both , but you ca n’t have a queue without a tut			0
you can , however , have a tut without a queue			0
rosé : the @entity30 love a compromise , and as compromises go , @entity204 is a cracker			0
it would have caught on sooner had it not come in dodgy - shaped bottles			0
@entity210 : a small and rarely well behaved @entity30 accessory @entity212 is for			0
‘ sorry ’ : @entity213 seems to think ‘ sorry ’ is the hardest word			0
he ’s clearly never played doubles or bumped trollies in @entity217			0
tree houses : these used to be knocked up in an afternoon by @entity221 with some old planks and about four cans of beer			0
these days they involve architects and need planning permission			0
@entity229 : it ’s been around since 500 @entity231 , but the @entity30 prefer to think it was invented about ten years ago			0
@entity234 : the world ’s whiffiest cheese comes in a round wooden box and is the ultimate @entity30 house present			0
do not confuse it with @entity240 , which is also a cheese that comes in a round box			0
@entity242 : a must - have in the @entity30 garden @entity244 is for			0
@entity242 : having this on the front of your house is the best way of informing passing burglars that it is a @entity30 home and is probably stuffed with silver			0
@entity255 ( kisses ) : the @entity30 now greet one another with kisses			0
the @entity257 make it look easy , but we never know which cheek to go for			0
some use this as an excuse to go straight for the lips			0
’ : when @entity30 folk meet someone there is a moment of unease until we have discovered who we know in common			0
@entity275 : the @entity30 pore over this property website			0
the price of other people ’s homes is always overestimated while ours is massively underestimated			0
