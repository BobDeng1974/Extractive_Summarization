by @entity0 published : 19:06 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 03:07 est , 7 february 2013 threat : air pollution to trigger potentially fatal pre-eclampsia in expectant mothers , a study has found exposure to air pollution could trigger potentially fatal pre-eclampsia in pregnant women , researchers have warned			1
women with asthma are particularly vulnerable to the condition - marked by high blood pressure and fluid retention - according to a new study			0
it blamed one in every 20 cases of pre-eclampsia on higher levels of ozone pollution in the air during the first three months of pregnancy , as well as an increase in premature births			1
the rate would mean pollution was a factor in up to 2,000 cases of pre-eclampsia in the @entity30 each year			1
as many as one in 20 first - time mothers develop pre-eclampsia , while around 20 women die each year from conditions linked to high blood pressure			1
it is thought to claim the lives of 600 babies a year			1
the only treatment is to deliver the baby early with an emergency caesarean			1
the new study adds to evidence of a link between air pollution and premature birth , with international research earlier this week showing higher pollution levels raised the risk of low birth weight			2
the study looked at almost 121,000 births in @entity52 , @entity53 , between 1998 and 2006			0
it compared the records with national data on the prevalence of asthma among the children ’s mothers ; and levels of the air pollutants ozone and vehicle exhaust ( nitrogen oxide ) in the @entity52 area			0
in all , 4.4 per cent of the pregnancies resulted in a premature birth and the prevalence of pre-eclampsia was 2.7 per cent , say findings published in the online journal @entity72			2
there was no association between exposure to levels of vehicle exhaust and complications of pregnancy , nor were any links found for any air pollutants and babies that were underweight at birth			0
but there did seem to be a link between exposure to ozone levels during the first three months of pregnancy and the risk of premature birth before 37 weeks and pre-eclampsia			2
each rose by four per cent for every 10 microgram per cubic metre increase in ambient ozone during this period , says the analysis			0
mothers with asthma were 25 per cent more likely to have a child born prematurely and 10 per cent more likely to have pre-eclampsia than mums without this condition			2
vulnerable : pregnant women with asthma were 10 per cent more likely to have pre-eclampsia than those without the condition the effect of pollution on inflammation processes in the body may be a potential mechanism , say the @entity53 researchers			1
asthma is an inflammatory condition and ozone may therefore have worsened respiratory symptoms and systemic inflammation , so accounting for the larger increase in the risk of premature birth among the mums with asthma , suggest the researchers			0
after taking account of various factors , they calculated that one in every 20 ( five per cent ) cases of pre-eclampsia were linked to ozone levels during early pregnancy			1
lead researcher @entity127 , of the department of public health and clinical medicine at @entity131 , said the findings should lead to improved monitoring of women with asthma during pregnancy			0
he said ‘ it ’s difficult to put into practice measures that will effectively reduce the risk , but it shows the importance of ensuring women ’s asthma symptoms are under control during early pregnancy			0
they need to use their medication to help counteract the possible health effects of pollution			2
‘ the study increases the evidence suggesting we should strive to keep reducing pollution levels to improve human health ’ he added .			0

pre-eclampsia can threaten the life of both mother and baby
pollution could be a factor in up to 2,000 cases every year in the @entity30
