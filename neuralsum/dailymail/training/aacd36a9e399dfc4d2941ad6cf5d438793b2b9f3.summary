after a week of live episodes to celebrate the 30th anniversary of @entity5 , the ' who killed @entity2 ? ' storyline came to an emotional end			1
@entity7 was revealed as the killer on thursday night , though @entity9 tried to take the blame for her murder when finally confronted by @entity12			1
but the tearful father realised his new wife was protecting his youngest son , and decided to protect their murderous secret anyway - as @entity7 does n't even realise he killed his sister			1
tragic truth : @entity20 discovers his son @entity7 killed @entity2 in the finale of the @entity5 live week show boss @entity23 said : ' he thinks she got up and walked out the door , and that is what @entity9 has said to him			1
' the producer said he initially had two other suspects in mind for the murder before deciding to put @entity7 in the frame and added the idea had been partly inspired by the murder mystery novels of @entity35			1
he said : ' three of @entity35 's best ones - one of them the detective did it , one of them everyone did it and one of them the narrator of the story did it			2
we always wanted those big twists			0
' he said it was a conscious decision not to show the fight between the two characters to protect the young actor , @entity51 , who plays @entity7			1
@entity23 said : ' the fact @entity7 did n't deliberately do it and it was an accident is very , very important			1
i would n't lumber a child with that			2
' the episode opened with @entity9 ( @entity57 ) and @entity12 ( @entity58 ) in the kitchen where he reveals how he knew @entity9 was hiding something			1
' when you stayed calm after @entity64 wanted to confront @entity65			0
everyone else was panicking but you stayed calm , ' @entity12 tells her when she asks how he knew something was amiss			0
' my little girl out on the common was it you ? are you covering for someone ? ' ' it was just me , only me , ' @entity9 says before @entity12 flies into a rage and kicks her out of the kitchen			2
protection : @entity12 will not go to the police about his son and @entity9 's murderous secret @entity64 ( @entity78 ) finds his dad in their trashed kitchen , and eventually a crying @entity12 tells him @entity9 's revelation			2
@entity9 then makes up a story of how she killed @entity2 : ' it was a freak thing , the wrong angle , the wrong part of her head			1
i should have phoned the police			0
i did n't and i panicked			2
' but @entity12 is n't convinced when @entity9 says she confessed to @entity87 ( @entity88 ) , who died from the injuries sustained after being hit by @entity91 's car			1
' why did n't @entity87 report it			0
she finally solves the case and does nothing to solve it , ' @entity12 says			0
' what are n't you telling me ? ' final words : @entity12 kissed the last letter of love written by @entity2 on the night she died then it dawns on him : ' he called his mum			1
he did something bad and he phoned you for help			0
' ' the door was open , she was lying there , ' @entity9 cries , ' i thought it was joke			2
i checked her breathing , there was nothing			0
he said she started it , but he did n't seem to know she was dead			0
he hit her with a box			0
' ' the jewellery box , he gave that to @entity121 , ' @entity117 ( @entity118 ) says shocked			0
' he 's a 10 - year old boy , why did he do such a thing , ' @entity12 laments			2
apology : @entity2 's letter was away of saying sorry for the trouble she had caused her father ' he said he heard the arguing that night , he could n't sleep			1
he said she was writing something , he wanted her to stop causing trouble			0
he picked up the box , she fell , he could n't wake her , he said he tried all on his own and that 's when he called me , ' @entity9 cries			1
@entity64 still did n't understand why @entity9 tried to cover it up and @entity9 continues to play the loving mother card to justify her actions to protect her son			1
@entity12 runs out the room to be sick when he hears that his wife put her into the boot of the car and carried her ' like a child ' into the woods before laying her down and crying her sorrys to her dead step - daughter			0
maternal instinct : @entity9 said she wanted to protect her son that 's why she disposed of @entity2 's body in @entity153 she continues to try and justify @entity7 's actions : ' he was frustrated , he just wanted to make things better			1
' then @entity157 ( @entity158 ) turns up to tell @entity12 about his mother @entity159 ( @entity160 ) actually being alive but the distraught father frantically tells him to leave			0
' is everything alright ? ' @entity7 says as he arrives home , unaware that he even killed @entity2 with his actions			1
ca n't believe it : @entity64 does n't want to continue the lie after finding out the truth about his twin sister 's death ' if the truth comes out we 're all going to get the blame , ' @entity64 says			1
@entity9 and @entity117 both say they should keep quiet , while @entity12 goes up to speak to his son			2
@entity7 than tells @entity64 that they must continue to cover up the murder			2
' i wo n't be part of it , ' @entity64 says			0
' nine hours she was laying there in the cold			0
the only people you care about is @entity9 and @entity7			1
' ' she treated her like a sack of rubbish , ' @entity64 screams and tells @entity12 ' he 'll never forgive him '			0
angry : @entity64 gets aggressive with @entity9 as she tries to persuade the family to keep the secret @entity64 runs out the house leaving @entity9 and @entity12 to reconcile over their decision to not got to the police with the truth			1
@entity7 also hands @entity117 the final note written by @entity2 which @entity9 referred to in her confession			1
too upset to read it , @entity117 takes it upon herself to recite the final words			0
' @entity201 i 'm sorry for what i said earlier			0
i did n't mean it , i 'm a wreck but i 'm going to change starting tonight , ' she says			0
the omen : @entity12 speaks to @entity7 , who does n't actually know that he killed @entity2 ' look at me home before midnight and the drugs are gone			1
when you get home look in on me i 'll be sleeping			0
' but wake me up i want to tell you how much you mean to me and how much i love you do n't forget dad wake me up , @entity211			0
' @entity12 breaks down in tears as he kissed the final words of his dead daughter			0
he then turns to @entity7 , ' you did n't do anything wrong			2
' meanwhile , rapist @entity217 ( @entity218 ) appeared to be lying dead in the @entity220 's beer room after landlord @entity221 ( @entity222 ) attacked him , and his daughter @entity223 ( @entity224 ) wants to go to the police			0
sticking together : @entity9 and @entity12 put on a united front for the sake of their son ' there 's a body , ' she tells the detective dealing with @entity234 's death			2
they think she 's talking about the nasty villain not @entity217 and @entity221 quickly pulls her away			0
