a detective who told a 12 - year - old boy to ‘ do it with someone your own age next time ’ after he confessed to raping a girl aged five has taken early retirement			1
the @entity8 revealed last month how the girl ’s parents felt badly let down by @entity11 because the boy received only a youth caution			2
an investigation by this newspaper discovered that detective constable @entity15 and @entity16 had recorded the boy admitting the offence but did not report him for the offence to social services			1
shocking : the five - year - old victim was raped by the 12 - year - old son of a neighbour ( file image ) instead , @entity24 issued the extraordinary piece of ‘ advice ’ to the youngster			1
the officers also neglected to collect fingerprints , photographs , dna or other forensic evidence			0
both were disciplined but returned to their duties with @entity11 ’s @entity35			0
the @entity36 understands that @entity37 is in his early 50s and more than four years short of his 30 - year term of service , after which officers can retire on full pensions			2
last night the girl ’s father said : ‘ we are relieved that @entity15 is no longer in a position where he can fail other child victims			0
’ but he said that police failings had not been addressed and the family had been denied justice			0

detective constable @entity15 has stepped down , it is understood
he and a *colleague* recorded the boy admitting to raping five - year - old
did not report him to social services and instead gave him a caution
mail on *sunday* investigation revealed detectives failure to report child
