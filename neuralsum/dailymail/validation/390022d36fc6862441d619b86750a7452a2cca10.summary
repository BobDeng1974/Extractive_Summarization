the investigation into claims of a vip paedophile sex ring widened dramatically yesterday after police raided the home of a disgraced @entity6 mp			1
@entity7 , 68 , had been named on a list of politicians passed to police by campaigning @entity12 mp @entity11			1
@entity14 officers spent two days searching his grace - and - favour home at @entity16 in @entity17 after a police team arrived on the estate on wednesday			1
@entity7 insisted he was a ' discreet ' man and had never been part of ' any rent boy ring ' with cabinet ministers , mps or military top brass former @entity25 mp @entity7 , who quit @entity26 in 1987 after admitting ‘ spanking sessions ’ with rent boys , was forced to deny any knowledge of the abuse and deaths of three young boys			1
he said he did not attend @entity35 ‘ sex parties ’ at an exclusive address near @entity26 and claimed to be trapped in a ‘ kafka-esque fantasy ’			1
it is understood that investigators now have up to nine current and former senior politicians on mr @entity11 ’s list in their sights as the sensitive inquiry gathers pace			1
speaking last night , mr @entity11 said he was pleased at the progress of the investigation and insisted that ‘ no stone must be left unturned ’			1
‘ it is encouraging to see that the @entity48 are continuing to fully investigate allegations of child abuse and prominent people , ’ he added			0
mr @entity7 today said he knew nothing about the allegations and wanted to talk to police at the ' earliest opportunity ' @entity7 faces being interviewed under caution within weeks by detectives with the @entity48 ’s @entity59 squad – which was set up in november to investigate claims of a @entity35 child sex abuse ring in the 1970s and 1980s			1
victims have come forward to claim men in powerful positions abused boys at the luxury @entity68 apartments in @entity69			2
they are also examining allegations that figures in politics , the military and law enforcement abused children at other locations			0
at the centre of the inquiry is an eyewitness described by police as ‘ credible ’ who claims three of those abused were murdered			2
in addition , detectives are examining a list passed to them by mr @entity11 last december which identifies 22 potential suspects across the political spectrum			1
it is believed that @entity7 ’s name has been repeatedly given to police by at least two alleged victims			2
on wednesday , detectives arrived at @entity16 near @entity93 – the seat of the @entity95 – where @entity7 has lived since 2003			1
they searched at least two properties on the 16,000 - acre estate including a red ramshackle building he moved out of in recent months			0
a @entity48 spokesman confirmed the search			0
@entity7 quickly proclaimed his innocence yesterday , denying any knowledge of abuse or murders			2
standing in the grounds of @entity16 , he said he is ‘ helping police with their inquiries ’			2
earlier he told @entity109 : ‘ i find myself in a very kafka-esque fantasy situation			0
i have never attended sex parties at @entity68 or anywhere else			1
i have not been part of any rent - boy ring with cabinet ministers , other members of @entity26 or generals or the military			0
’ mr @entity7 , 68 , lives in the 16,000 - acre grounds of @entity16 ( pictured ) , near @entity93 in @entity17 he added : ‘ i was a discreet person and regarded in the @entity120 as a very independent mp and a loner			1
’ @entity7 also said he was keen to be interviewed by police as soon as possible to clear his name			2
mr @entity7 said that he had pleaded guilty to four charges of gross indecency in 1987 for offences relating to to the age of consent for homosexuality , which has since been lowered from 21 to 16 he added : ‘ i believe the number of victims grows by the day , and the number of alleged perpetrators – through death – diminishes			1
it ’s certainly a problem for me			0
my problem is that i am still very much alive			0
’ @entity7 , who represented @entity137 and nearby @entity138 , was an outspoken hard - right @entity6 but left @entity26 after pleading guilty to gross indecency			1
the mp – who was given the nickname ‘ @entity140 ’ – would order rent boys as young as 17 to call him ‘ sir ’ or ‘ @entity143 ’ and pretend he was a headmaster as he caned them			0
he was fined just £ 1,450 but the case signalled the end of his career because his confession followed years of vehement denials			0
two months before his court appearance it was revealed how @entity7 was caught by security staff on holiday in @entity153 with a naked 15 - year - old local boy hiding under his bed			0
he later went to work for the @entity95 as his private secretary and in recent years has been responsible for ‘ public and park events ’			0
the 1987 offences would no longer be crimes under current laws after the age of consent for homosexual activity changed from 21 to 16			0
campaigning mp @entity11 passed his dossier naming suspected @entity35 paedophiles to police in december last year			1
the explosive list identifies 22 potential suspects across the political spectrum who are allegedly linked to historic child abuse between 1970 and the late - 1990s			2
of these , nine are still alive , and are said to include four serving mps , three former mps , a member of the @entity175 and one high - ranking town hall figure			0
the document also includes the names of 13 ex-ministers , including at least two who allegedly went to ‘ abuse parties ’			0
the report names 14 @entity6 politicians , five @entity12 and three others			2
as a young councillor in @entity186 , mr @entity11 uncovered evidence a @entity6 cabinet minister was allegedly involved			1
he alerted police but was told three months later that the inquiry was being shelved on the orders of ‘ those at the top ’			0
