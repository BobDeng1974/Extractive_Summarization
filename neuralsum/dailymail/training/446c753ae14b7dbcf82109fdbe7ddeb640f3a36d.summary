but this annoying problem could be a thing of the past as a team of hackers have proved that it is possible to use data collected from a @entity14 to determine if a viewer is asleep and pause a film on @entity17 automatically			1
the ‘ @entity19 ’ software was created during an experimental @entity20 in @entity21 but there are no plans at present to roll out the technology			1
it uses an accelerometer to track a person 's movements			0
the device compares data so determine the normal amount of activity when a person is awake , with how much they move in sleep			0
a video demonstrating the software shows a wearable @entity14 device , which tracks a person ’s movements , communicating with @entity17 on a laptop			1
as the wearer of the @entity14 falls asleep , the device confirms a person 's inactivity and ' tells ' a the laptop to pause a film or programme			2
the @entity14 device detects when a wearer has fallen asleep by using its accelerometer to detect movement			2
a video demonstrating the technology shows a wearable @entity14 device ( pictured ) which tracks a person 's movements , communicating with @entity17 when it sends data to with the laptop indicating that a person is asleep , @entity17 gradually turns down the volume on the device and pauses the film or programme a person was watching so that they can sleep in peace			1
the screen also displays a visual prompt so that when the viewer wakes up , they can see at what point they fell asleep during the film and how much is left			0
when the user returns to @entity17 after a break , they can see a series of messages or options so that they can resume viewing any programmes or films that they did not manage to stay awake through and can choose whether to resume their viewing from an old bookmark or the point at which they fell asleep			0
while many people may be keen for the hack to be made available to the general public soon , a note attached to the video said : ‘ the hack is the result of a fun , experimental and creative event at @entity17 and does not suggest that @entity17 will be pursuing this idea as a product improvement			0
