by @entity0 there was nothing surprising or unexpected in watching @entity3 explode with rage at @entity5 this weekend			1
the @entity7 manager has two distinct sides to his character : a sort of @entity11			1
the one seen away from the heat of battle is a smiling , charming , innocent ‘ cheeky chap ’ who is ‘ doing ever so well ’ on limited resources at @entity7			1
the other will do whatever is needed to try to wring out any advantage for his team			0
as we have seen , he is also prone to combustible behaviour — and he seems to think that whatever is said or insinuated when under pressure can be forgiven and forgotten with an apology			2
blast : @entity27 ( left ) was on the receiving end of an absuive tirade from @entity3 ( right ) unsavoury : @entity3 later apologised for calling @entity27 a ' f * * * * * * old c * * * ' bone of contention : @entity3 was raging because referee @entity34 disallowed @entity36 's goal i remember @entity3 best for his comments in the tunnel at half - time , when he was always looking to sow seeds of doubt and open up the possibility of gaining his side an advantage			1
he would try to influence you by painting the picture that his team were already getting the rough end of the stick			0
those observations were delivered ‘ in passing ’ and usually out of earshot of others , which tended to make them hard to ignore and impossible to report			0
he certainly put his own slant on one particular match when i was refereeing his @entity60 team and the whole episode left me open to accusations of favouring his team			0
after that game at @entity64 between @entity60 and @entity65 , @entity3 said how well i had done in signalling to the bench that one of his players , the on - loan @entity67 , was one foul away from a red card			1
this , he said , had afforded him the opportunity to replace @entity67			0
i had no issue with what had happened , but he made it appear that we had arranged the whole thing in the tunnel at half - time , which was untrue			2
giving some back : @entity27 and @entity3 had a fiery exchange of words on the touchline it 's not over yet : @entity3 pointed the finger as @entity34 made his way down the tunnel at half - time history : @entity0 ( left ) talks to then @entity91 manager @entity3 after a 0 - 0 draw at @entity93 in 2004 before the 2004 @entity96 play - off final , when he was manager of @entity91 , @entity3 had a word with me about @entity98 at the exchange of team sheets			1
we all knew @entity98 was a physical player whose effectiveness was often nullified after a yellow card , so @entity3 tried to pressurise me into not cautioning him on such a big stage			1
@entity98 was the first @entity91 player cautioned that afternoon			0
@entity3 had every cause to complain after @entity34 disallowed a perfectly good goal for offside on sunday			1
it would have equalised @entity112 ’s opening effort and put @entity7 back in the match			1
but there can be no defence of the disgraceful outburst to which @entity3 subjected city manager @entity27			1
one can only assume that @entity118 , the fourth official , did not hear the comment , which was picked up on tv			0
perhaps @entity118 ’s hearing was muffled by his ‘ beanie ’ hat			0
being the fourth official in the middle of warring managers is an almost impossible task , made even more difficult by the trend not to report players — let alone managers — for abusive or insulting comments			0
the last thing the referee needs is to be called over to the technical area to dismiss a manager , particularly the home one after denying them a goal			1
he ’s better off in the middle , away from the angry crowd — and there are few more vocal than the @entity7			2
imagine the reaction if @entity118 had reported @entity3 to @entity34 and they had removed him from the technical area			2
friend or foe ? @entity150 , during his first spell at @entity149 , gives @entity0 an earful at @entity152 on the receiving end : sir @entity154 was renowned for his bullish approach with match officials @entity118 found himself in a tough position , one that was n’t helped by the fact that there really has been no clear directive on what is and what is not seen as acceptable behaviour			0
too much is left to interpretation , which encourages managers to push their luck			0
@entity3 was not the first , nor the only manager , to try to get inside my head			1
@entity172 adopted a similar approach , carefully making a comment at a time he thought it would have maximum impact and might influence your thinking			0
his demeanour and gravitas meant he was more effective than @entity3 , complaining and pleading for more protection for his players			2
it was delivered so well that you often found yourself giving more free - kicks to @entity186 early in the second half			2
sir @entity154 was quite the opposite : subtlety was not a tool he employed			0
it was full - frontal , in - your - face fury			2
the first season i refereed at @entity195 he was into my dressing room after the final whistle to give me the full ‘ hairdryer ’ treatment over the fact that i had not added on enough time			0
@entity7 drew that game ! @entity203 : @entity150 's preferred tactic was to befriend officials in a bid to curry favour on the pitch @entity150 worked quite differently : he wanted you to think of him as a friend — and as a result he expected favours , which meant he would be hurt when you dealt with his team in exactly the same way as any other			1
in his first pre-season at @entity152 he invited me to a meeting with all of his players and introduced me as the best referee in @entity220 ! as for @entity3 , he is well aware that he went way too far and his apology should not have prevented the @entity222 from imposing a touchline ban			1
whatever the provocation , however bad the decision , all managers must remember their position and keep their composure and dignity			0
game over : @entity231 netted @entity112 's second goal to kill off @entity3 's @entity7 side at @entity5 ' derided : @entity34 ( centre ) deals with @entity235 ( right ) and @entity36 during the clash bad day : @entity34 made the wrong call for @entity7 's ' goal ' the incident has led to calls for the offside law to be revised			1
but the law is clearly defined and needs no adjustment — it just needs to be applied correctly			0
this is the law in its simplest form : when the ball is played forward to a colleague in the opponents ’ half of the field : why @entity251 three @entity7 players were in offside positions when the ball was played forward , but they should not have been penalised as they did not touch the ball , interfere with opponents or obstruct @entity258 ’s line of sight			2
@entity3 's previous ... @entity3 has managed to get himself in plenty of touchline scrapes – here are three ... @entity264 blow : the then @entity91 manager tussles with @entity266 s @entity172 in 2006 angry @entity3 : @entity3 vents his fury at then @entity269 manager @entity268 in 2012 when push comes to shove : @entity3 nudges linesman @entity271 against @entity272 in 2012 for more of @entity3 's touchline tantrums , click here			1

@entity7 manager labels @entity27 a ' f * * * * * * old c * * * ' at @entity5
@entity222 remind @entity3 of his *responsibilities* after blast
@entity36 's disallowed goal *sparked* @entity3 's rage
@entity112 went on to beat @entity7 2 - 0
@entity3 should not be exempt from touchline ban despite apology
