the vulnerable child called either ' april or @entity23 ' was being cared for at the @entity8 children 's convalescent home in @entity9 in the 1960s , the informant said			1
the allegation was detailed in a report published today following an independent investigation into @entity30 by @entity31			0
the report stated : ' the @entity33 stated that he witnessed a girl , who he believes was called april or @entity23 , being dragged across the garden at @entity8 by “ @entity10 ” and another man			1
she appeared to be in a stupor			0
' the next day the @entity33 was told by the @entity39 that this girl had died '			1

but @entity46 has today confirmed it is investigating the claims			2
@entity8 was shut shortly after the alleged incident in the 1960s			1
a spokesman for @entity46 said : ' @entity46 has received the report on @entity8 , and started an investigation to determine if abuse took place and if so to what extent			1
' the report did conclude that sexual abuse was ' likely to have taken place ' at the home but said its extent could not be known			1
it added that it ' has not been possible to associate @entity10 with the abuse ' other than the claim made by the complainant , who was recovering from tuberculosis between the ages of four and nine			0
the report 's author @entity68 said her investigation had been ' challenging ' because the allegations into the home in the village of @entity9 dated back over 50 years			0
she concluded the evidence of two victims who alleged sexual abuse had taken place was ' convincing ' , and has passed their complaints to police for further investigation			1
' other than the informant , no other individual interviewed , or record read , made reference to @entity10 ( @entity87 ) being present at @entity8 , ' the report read			2
ms @entity68 concluded the evidence she had seen was ' not of sufficient strength in nature to enable the lead investigator to conclude that the man who abused the @entity33 was in fact @entity87			2
' the victim 's allegations first came to light when he contacted @entity98 investigators , who have looked into hundreds of claims of abuse at @entity10 's hands , claiming he was abused by the former @entity18 on at least four occasions			2
he told ms @entity68 a man ' called @entity10 ' would come to the home , bringing books and film reels , and ' would have us kissing and cuddling him '			2
the victim told her ' he managed to make you feel loved and cared for ' but had later abused him			0
@entity8 ( pictured ) was shut shortly after the alleged incident and investigators have not been able to find evidence that @entity10 had visited , although they believe children were abused there on a few occasions , the man said he and another little girl were taken from @entity118 in the back of a camper van by @entity10 and a male friend , who had an @entity124 or @entity125 accent			1
he said that when taken out of the home , they would go to a motorway service station or for picnics			0
the alleged abuse took place between 1959 and 1964			0
welcoming the findings , @entity132 , the @entity134 trust 's nursing director , said the trust already had ' very robust processes in place to protect children and vulnerable adults '			0
