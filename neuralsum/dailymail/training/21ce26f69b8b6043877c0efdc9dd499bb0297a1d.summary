by @entity0 it is miles away from his life as a surgeon in the suburbs of @entity6 , but @entity7 is about to return to his second home - a hospital in the very poor and very dangerous city of @entity11 , in the @entity12			1
it will be the 11th trip for the 58 - year - old and the 10th for his wife @entity15 , 60 , to the hospital , which is located in the most dangerous part of the country , where rebel fighting is common and some of the perpetrators of the @entity22 genocide live in the jungle			1
the couple , who have two children and four grandchildren began packing up their lives for a month each year and travelling to the troubled nation , after first visiting the hospital in 2003			0
' [ a @entity12 doctor ] took me around the hospital and i could see the potential , and i thought we ’ve got the expertise , we could do something about this , ' said @entity7			1
@entity7 and @entity38 have been travelling to the @entity12 since 2003 , where they work at a local hospital treating locals and training doctors @entity7 has treated child soldiers and other victims of the civil war , which has been raging in the country since 1996 over the years the couple have been shelled , treated wounded soldiers who were involved in a gunfight outside the hospital , been forced to evacuate to @entity22 , and treated local people who have suffered in ways that defy comprehension			1
once @entity7 , a @entity6 father - of - two and grandfather - of - four , was at the hospital when someone came in who had been shot in a skirmish in the civil war			1
' i had my passport in the top pocket of my theatre scrubs …			0
i operated on him and i got blood on it , ' he said			0
' my passport was stained with @entity12 blood , ' he said , a somewhat apt summary of his commitment to the troubled country			1
the @entity12 has suffered through civil war since 1998 and since then an estimated six million people have been killed in the conflict , most through dispossession and malnourishment , rather than through direct fighting			1
the horrors are particularly acute for women and the @entity12 is currently thought to have the highest rate of sexual violence of any country in the world			2
when @entity7 arrived at the hospital , it was run - down and under - resourced and he saw the opportunity to train up local doctors and make a difference in the lives of the local @entity12 a very common condition that @entity7 treats at the hospital is goitres , which are caused by thyroid issues , most commonly resulting from an iodine deficiency @entity7 says that some of the things he has seen – some of which are too graphic to mention here – make him believe ' it is an evil place '			1
' last year i was introduced to this young lad , 13 or 14 , he was one of the soldiers [ in the war ]			2
' because our hospital has the mandate of treating everyone who comes to them , in one ward we had child soldiers and the @entity12 army fighting them			1
' we 've seen some pretty horrific things done to women , it 's a key centre for fistula repair , which is due in many cases to sexual assault			0
' but it is also a place that has captured his heart and that of his wife , and prompts them to make return visits each year , taking teams of @entity126 doctors and nurses to train local hospital staff and provide medical care to locals			1
each time the couple visit , and @entity7 is due to make his 11th visit this year , they pay their own way , which costs about $ 6,000 for each of them			2
they also foot the bill for in - patient care at the hospital while they are there , so as not to exhaust the budget of the hospital , which is often inundated with patients requiring surgery when they know that the @entity126 doctors are coming			2
one of the great challenges of being in the @entity12 , says @entity7 , is coming up with innovative ways of treating people in less than optimal conditions			1
' you do n't have the resources , you 've got to improvise and use what you have , ' he said			0
on his first visit , @entity7 found a hospital in the process of being rebuilt after being destroyed in a volcano blast in 2002			2
it had limited equipment and what equipment it did have would often blow due to power surges , as well as having no running water			0
scrubbing up before surgeries required an assistant to hold up a bucket of water with holes poked in the side to create a flow of clean water for @entity7 to use			0
' our @entity12 daughter ' : @entity175 arrived at the hospital after attempting suicide in 2009			2
after an operation by @entity7 she is now flourishing and has been adopted and financially supported by @entity7 and @entity15 @entity7 and @entity15 paid @entity175 to study accountancy and she now works at the hospital managing the hospital 's finances the @entity183 was shelled a few years ago as part of the civil war , while @entity7 and @entity15 were working there once , a three - year - old boy named @entity188 was brought in to the hospital after swallowing a metal object , which got stuck in his airway , went septic and developed into pneumonia			1
' we knew in @entity126 we would have the equipment to get that out , but we did n't in the @entity12			0
we worked with the @entity12 staff and said , “ what have you got ? ” and used an endoscope , we eventually got this little metal stud out of his airway			0
' who knows what this three - year - old will go on to be ? he could be a great leader in the country			1
' for @entity15 , it is the relationships that keep her passion for the work alive , despite the difficult and dangerous conditions			0
' we go back every year and they truly value that , that 's a sign to them that we do really care , ' she said			0
the @entity214 destroyed the @entity216 hospital in 2002 as well as half of @entity11 @entity188 , three , almost died after he swallowed a metal stud that got stuck in his throat ( x-ray right )			0
@entity7 performed a makeshift surgery on the boy and saved his life one of the most enduring relationships the couple has is with a young woman named @entity175 , who was brought to the hospital in 2009 after she tried to take her own life by swallowing battery acid			2
the incident resulted in the narrowing of her oesophagus , making it impossible for her to eat			0
in @entity126 , this would be treated by surgery that involved opening her chest , which was not an option at the under - resourced @entity12 hospital			1
' we had to work out a way to do the surgery in our context , ' said @entity7 , who was able to put a piece of her large intestine up through her chest , a surgery he had never performed before , allowing her to eat normally once again			0
' she asked us could she be our @entity12 daughter , ' said @entity7			1
since then he and @entity15 were able to support @entity175 through her accountancy training and she now works at the hospital managing its finances			2
@entity175 's income is sent back to her family and she has funded her sister 's university studies			0
' five or six hours of stress in the operating theatre for me and it has made such a large difference in her life , ' said @entity7			0
the @entity265 , who are both @entity266 and are motivated by their faith to continue their work , have funded the training of many doctors and nurses who work at the @entity272			0
in 2010 they started @entity273 a not - for - profit organisation to help people make contributions to the hospital and the work the @entity265 do there			0
they are currently raising funds to provide scholarships to @entity12 doctors to further their training and to purchase monitoring equipment for the hospital			1
the hospital is located in the north - east of the country , which is plagued by rebel fighting the fighting in the @entity12 has claimed the lives of up to six million people since it began in 1996			1
