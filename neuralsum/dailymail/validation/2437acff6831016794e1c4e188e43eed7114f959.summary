common sense would suggest that when molten lava meets a sheet of ice it will simply melt through			1
but geologist professor @entity4 and artist professor @entity5 from @entity6 in @entity7 found that the results can be far more spectacular			1
using a lava furnace to heat gravel to temperatures of more than 1,100 째 @entity12 ) they were able to pour it onto a slab of ice to produce a seething , bubbling mass of molten rock			1
@entity20 turns ice directly into steam which bubbles up through the molten rock to form bizarre glass bubbles professor @entity4 , who has been pouring lava in a series of experiments to better understand how it behaves and forms geological formations , described it as ' scrambled eggs from hell '			1
rather than melting straight through the ice , the lava instead flows rapidly on top of it on a cushion of steam			2
steam from the ice below bubbles up through the molten rock as it tries to escape , forming a layer of glassy bubbles			1
professor @entity4 said : ' the first guess is that it is going to explode or it is tunnel down and make a hole in the ice			0
of course it did n't do any of those things			0
' it did things we just did n't really expect			0
' professor @entity4 and professor @entity5 have together set up the @entity53 at @entity6 's department of @entity55 to study how lava behaves in different situations			0
they create lava by melting basalt gravel in a giant gas fired furnace and then pouring it over sand , ice and through water			2
according to @entity66 , a nuclear chemist working with @entity68 and a science presenter with the @entity70 , the extreme heat of the lava is what causes the strange formations to form when it hits the ice			0
he said : ' the lava is so hot that when it is poured on to the ice , the ice turns not into water but straight into steam			2
' the formation of all of this steam helps the lava to flow			0
it is sitting on top of a blanket of steam rather than the ice itself , this means the friction between the lava and the ice surface is very low			0
the lava flows rapidly across the surface of the ice on a cushion of escaping steam it creates as it moves ' as the lava cools we start to get a thick black layer forming on top and that starts to trap those bubbles of superheated steam inside the rock			1
' it is kind of like a natural form of glass blowing			0
' the team used a specially created lava furnace to heat basaltic gravel to temperatures of more than 1,100 째 c professor @entity4 ( left ) and professor @entity5 ( right ) have been studying how lava flows behave			1

@entity20 heated to 1,100 째 c turn ice straight into steam which then bubbles up through the molten rock to form a seething sheet of bubbles
the experiment was conducted by geologists at @entity6 , @entity7
they created a lava furnace where they can melt basaltic gravel into lava
