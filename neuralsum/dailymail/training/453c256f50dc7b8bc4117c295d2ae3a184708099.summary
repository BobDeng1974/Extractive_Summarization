defying odds of one - in - a - trillion , a @entity2 couple were shocked to find a box of six eggs which were all double - yolkers			1
the chances of finding just a single double - yolk egg are less than one in 1,000			1
but a box of six double - yolkers as @entity10 and @entity11 , of @entity12 , @entity2 , found is even more unlikely than winning the lottery			1
two of the double - yolked eggs : a @entity2 couple were shocked to find all six eggs were double - yolkers @entity10 , 48 , was rustling up sausage , egg and chips for his wife ’s tea and popped to corner shop @entity23 and wine , near his home to pick up a box of eggs			1
when he cracked the first egg into the frying pan and saw the double yolk he could n’t believe his luck			2
@entity10 said : ' my wife and i often have eggs but i ’d never seen a double yolk before in all my life			2
@entity10 , 48 , left , was rustling up sausage , egg and chips for his wife , @entity42 's tea and popped to corner shop @entity43 , near his home to pick up a box of eggs			1
@entity42 pictured right with @entity10 ' then i cracked another open and i could n’t believe it - there was another one			2
the odds of what was happening kept going through my head			0
' i was really excited because i wondered whether there could be even more double - yolkers in the box			1
but i did n’t dare to find out until i made dinner again the next day			0
' the @entity57 said the chances of one double - yolked egg are less than 0.1per cent - one in 1,000			1
the first double - yolked egg was a surprise , but @entity10 could n't believe it when he cracked the next egg and it also turned out to be double - yolked that could make the odds of finding six in one box one in a trillion , although experts say that double - yolked eggs come in clusters from young hens about 20 - to - 28 weeks old			1
when the first egg is double - yolked , the box is likely to contain more double - yolked eggs , they claim			1
@entity10 added : ' when it got down to the last one , i was so nervous that i actually dropped it			2
it cracked on to the kitchen floor and there was yet again another double yolk			0
@entity10 , pictured with his wife @entity42 , said after finding several eggs double - yolked : ' when it got down to the last one , i was so nervous that i actually dropped it			1
it cracked on to the kitchen floor and there was yet again another double yolk ' what happened must be as unlikely as winning the lottery - although the lottery would be better , obviously			2
we ’d probably be sitting in another country right now and not eating eggs			0
' @entity10 , who is a full - time carer for his wife , said : ' i love a yolk , so to have two for each egg meant they tasted great			2
winning the lottery : 14,000,000 to one			0
becoming an astronaut : 13,200,000 to one			0
being killed by lightning : 2,320,000 to one			0
being killed by a shark : 264,100,000 to one			0
' fried eggs are my favourite and i really like them runny , so it worked out well			0
' @entity11 , who suffers from osteoarthritis , was just as amazed			0
the 43 - year - old said : ' i did n’t think these things happened anymore , so it ’s very strange			0
' @entity10 returned to the store where he explained to shopkeeper @entity110 what had happened			2
it turned out the eggs were from a farm in @entity115			0
@entity10 explained : ' @entity110 said he ’d seen a double - yolker before but had never sold a half - dozen box of them			1
' i doubt we ’ll ever come across a box like that again			0
i think it ’s just one of those things			0
' the odds of winning the jackpot on the @entity127 are only one in 14 million			0
finding a double - yolker can often mean more than just duplicating your breakfast - as some people believe they are a sign of a marriage due to pregnancy , predictions of a windfall , the birth of twins and a death in the family			1
@entity10 , pictured , who is a full - time carer for his wife , said : ' i love a yolk , so to have two for each egg meant they tasted great ' @entity147 said : ' i doubt we 'll ever come across a box like that again			1
i think it 's just one of those things ' double - yolked eggs almost always come from young hens about 20 - to - 28 weeks old , experts say two years ago a pack of six eggs also turned out to be double - yolkers			1
it happened to @entity161 , of the @entity162 on @entity163 , and her friend @entity164			0
as they were making profiteroles , the two friends cracked four eggs one - by - one into a mixing bowl			2
the first was a double - yolker			2
the second , was also a double - yolker			2
with a sense of anticipation they crack the third - again a double yolker			2
surely not the fourth as well ? as they cracked the final egg , another double - yolker fell into the mixing bowl			1
it turned out the last two eggs in their box were also double - yolkers			1
@entity185 , an agriculture director at @entity186 , which supplies eggs to supermarkets , told @entity189 double - yolked eggs almost always come from young hens about 20 - to - 28 weeks old			1
he said : ' in reality it gets its mechanics just slightly wrong			0
you get a young bird and it comes to lay its first egg and it releases more than one egg yolk			0
it forms a shell around the egg and out pops a rather large egg with two egg yolks in it			0
' the chances of getting a double - yolk from one of these hens is much higher			1
one in every 100 eggs from these birds are double - yolk			1
' we 've also learned from our research that the eggs in a box are very likely to come from the same flock , and flocks are usually around the same age			0
on that basis we can say that while chance of finding one double - yolk egg may be 1/1000 , the chance of finding a second is considerably higher - more like 1/100			1
' so the event that occurred in @entity161 's kitchen was a billion - to - one event ? probably not , the @entity189 magazine wrote			0
there 's another big factor we need to consider - the size of the eggs			0
double - yolk eggs are far more likely to be large			1
yet the eggs that young birds lay are normally small			0
any large eggs that are laid would be picked out and boxed together			0
this means if you find a large double - yolk egg - and you know the other eggs in the box are from the same young flock - then the chance that the other eggs are also double - yolkers becomes a lot more likely			1
in the most extreme case , you 'd find that if the first egg is a double - yolker , all the eggs are double - yolkers			1
so bearing all this in mind what happened when we went back to the last two eggs in @entity161 's box ? well as if to prove us right it turned out egg five and egg six were both double - yolkers			1
on our initial naive reading this would be a one - in - a - quintillion double - yolk streak			2
but as with most things there 's actually a more obvious explanation			0

the box of eggs was bought from the local corner store while @entity10 was rustling up sausage and eggs
@entity57 say chances of just one double - yolked egg are less than 0.1per cent - one in 1,000
chances of finding six double - yolked eggs in one tray could be one - in - a - trillion
