by @entity0 shot dead : this @entity2 rhea was on the loose in @entity3 for almost two months the giant @entity2 rhea that has evaded capture for more than a month has been shot - and will be turned into gourmet sausages			1
gamekeeper @entity8 , 65 , spotted the 6ft flightless bird 70 yards away in a rape seed field and killed it with one shot to the head			1
the rhea , named @entity14 , had become a frequent sight on @entity16 near @entity17 , @entity3			0
but with a top speed of 45mph , its pursuers were never able to get close			1
and since the six - inch claws of the female bird were said to be capable of disembowelling a grown man , many people did not want to try			1
but police had grown concerned the rhea , which escaped in mid-march from a smallholding belonging to experienced rhea owner @entity29 in @entity31 's @entity30 , @entity32 , would cause a car crash			1
@entity8 mr @entity8 provided photographic of evidence of the dead bird , which some nicknamed @entity37 after the pop legend @entity38			1
he told the @entity39 : ' i suppose some people might say it is a shame the rhea is dead but it would be terrible if it caused someone to die in a car crash			1
' i saw the rhea near the roadside at one point and it would easily have caused a car to swerve and hit a tree			1
' what â€™s the life of a bird against the life of a person or family ? the police wanted it out of the way and there was no way anyone would be able to capture it			2
' the flightless bird resembling something between an ostrich and an emu was the butt of countless ' birdie ' jokes after it made frequent appearances on the golf course			2
but it was deadly serious for the @entity73 , which issued a warning to residents not to approach @entity14			0
a spokesman said : ' rheas are large birds and have the potential to be dangerous as they are strong , fast and have sharp claws			2
our advice to the general public is keep well away and call us or the police if they see the bird			2
' local newspapers printed advice to residents on what they should do if confronted under the headline ' rhea guard action '			0
and one person searching for the bird , @entity105 , said she had received a phone call from a mystery man three weeks ago warning her he would shoot the rhea on sight			0
she told the @entity111 : ' i implored him not to - it 's doing no harm and there are lots of people badly trying to find a way to catch it			0
' a @entity120 spokesman told @entity121 : ' police have received notification that the missing @entity124 has been lawfully killed near a carriageway in @entity126 , as there was fear of it getting onto a main road and causing a collision			0
' the owner had previously given permission for the bird to be dispatched if the situation deemed it necessary , which was the case			0
' we have spoken to the owner who is aware			0
