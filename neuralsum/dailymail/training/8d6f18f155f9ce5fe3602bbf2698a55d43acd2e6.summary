the dark lady who inspired some of @entity3 ’s romantic sonnets may have had a rather unladylike profession			2
an expert on the @entity6 suggests she may have been a notorious prostitute called ‘ @entity7 ’ or ‘ @entity8 ’ who ran a brothel in @entity11 , @entity12			1
shakespeare scholar dr @entity13 said he had unearthed documents that indicate she is ‘ the foremost candidate for the dubious role of the @entity0 ’			1
new research claims the ' dark lady ' of @entity3 's sonnets was a notorious @entity12 prostitute named @entity7 or @entity20 - a dark - skinned madam who ran a licentious house in @entity11			1
above , the @entity6 in @entity12 many of the sonnets 127 to 152 are addressed to an unidentified woman with whom @entity25 imagines having an affair			1
in @entity28 the temptress is referred to as ‘ my female evil ’ and ‘ my bad angel ’			0
the identity of the @entity0 has mystified academics for years			0
to her contemporaries , she was known as ' an arrant whore and a bawde ’ , catering for everyone from ‘ ingraunts ’ ( immigrants ) to ‘ welthyemen ’ and the aristocracy			1
the sonnets give few details describing her , apart from her dark eyes , hair and complexion , with hints that she was married			0
this identity was tentatively suggested in the 1930s but dr @entity13 has now found public records that convince him that she is ' the foremost candidate for the dubious role of the dark lady ' , the @entity47 reported			1
dr @entity13 discovered part of the evidence in the diary of @entity56 , the theatre owner who built the @entity57 ( right ) and whose acting company was a rival to @entity3 ’s			1
left , @entity60 as @entity56 in the film @entity61 the first of the so - called ' dark lady ' poems ... in the old age black was not counted fair , or if it were , it bore not beauty 's name ; but now is black beauty 's successive heir , and beauty slandered with a bastard shame : for since each hand hath put on @entity74 's power , fairing the foul with @entity77 's false borrowed face , sweet beauty hath no name , no holy bower , but is profaned , if not lives in disgrace			1
therefore my mistress ' eyes are raven black , her eyes so suited , and they mourners seem at such who , not born fair , no beauty lack , sland'ring creation with a false esteem : yet so they mourn becoming of their woe , that every tongue says beauty should look so			0
the @entity6 imagines an unidentified woman - known as the ' dark lady ' but not actually named by him in that way - in an adulterous sexual relationship			2
she is the inspiration for many of the sonnets 127 to 152			1
she is ' my female evil ' and ' my bad angel ' in sonnet 144			0
dr @entity13 discovered part of the evidence in the diary of @entity56 , the theatre owner who built the @entity57 and whose acting company was a rival to @entity3 ’s			1
within its pages , there is mention of both @entity117 and her associate @entity118 , who operated another @entity11 brothel			1
@entity56 , who staged at least one of @entity3 ’s plays - @entity123 - recorded 30 occasions when he dined with a @entity118 who was also @entity56 ’s bailiff for properties that he owned			1
the discovery that @entity20 and @entity127 were also @entity56 ’s tenants adds a definitive link to @entity3 ’s world , according to the scholar			1
dr @entity13 said : ' the name " @entity118 " is rare in @entity12 parish records and we are on safe ground in taking the brothel - owner to be @entity127			1
it proves the connection between @entity127 and @entity56			0
' he adds : ' to my knowledge , no one has spotted this connection before			0
' @entity7 also appears in a list of bawdy entertainments – the @entity145 entertainments of 1594 – and in a few plays and literary texts of the period			0
apart from a midnight raid on her premises , @entity20 is not recorded as being arrested , though her girls were , and court documents include references to her successful brothel			2
he says : ' @entity20 ’s bad name was so well - known that anyone reading @entity3 ’s … sonnets … in the 1590s and early 1600s is likely to have brought her to mind , and @entity3 must have known this			2
' @entity7 also appears in a list of bawdy entertainments - the @entity145 entertainments of 1594 - and in a few plays and literary texts of the period			2
above , @entity168 's @entity167 from the 1700s during @entity173 's involvement in the slave trade in the 16th century , thousands of @entity169 and @entity171 slaves were ferried to @entity12 ports - on the same ships that brought imperial products such as tea , sugar , cotton and rum			2
those who came to @entity173 were often brought in by naval officers and government officials returning to the @entity173			0
some black people were offered to the commanders of slaving vessels as gifts , and were later sold into domestic service			0
slavery was legal in @entity173 until 1772 , and many of these @entity169 found themselves working as butlers or other household attendants in noble families			0
in 1764 @entity195 reported that there was ' supposed to be near 20,000 ... negroe servants ' in @entity12 : the magazine went on to say that ' the main objections to their importation is , that they cease to consider themselves as slaves in this free country , nor will they put up with an inequality of treatment , nor more willingly perform the laborious offices of servitude than our own people '			0
acknowledging that trying to unravel the @entity0 is controversial , he concludes that there is sufficient ' circumstantial ' evidence : ' whoever that person was , @entity3 painted her with the reputation of @entity20 … this is new evidence			2
' the link to @entity11 is further strengthened by @entity3 ’s own connections with the area			0
not only did he know people who lived there , but he may also have had his own relatives there			0
in parish records , dr @entity13 found several shakespeares , including a @entity3 who was married to an @entity227 – sister of the dramatist @entity229 , who probably collaborated with the @entity6 on @entity123			1
in a @entity12 with only 200,000 population , such connections are significant			0
dr @entity13 also notes the lack of evidence for the supposition that prostitutes circulated around @entity236 and @entity237 , the site of the @entity239 and @entity240 theatres : ' the stews were closed down by @entity242 in 1546 and that drastically inhibited prostitution activity in the area			1
' the majority of cases were north of @entity247 , including @entity11			2
' his new research will be published by @entity250 in @entity251 in october .			0

madam , also known as @entity20 , was ' an arrant whore ' who ran a brothel in @entity11 , north - east @entity12
inspired many of @entity6 's sonnets 127 to 152
@entity6 had friends , and *possibly* relatives , who lived in @entity11
dr @entity13 cites evidence in diary of @entity56 , who built @entity57
@entity56 knew @entity7 and her associate @entity118 , another brothel owner
they were both tenants of @entity56 , who had a rival acting company
