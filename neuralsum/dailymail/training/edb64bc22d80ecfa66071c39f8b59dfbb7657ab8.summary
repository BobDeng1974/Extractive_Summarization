by @entity0 an @entity2 man has become the second person to die in the @entity4 of the new ' @entity6 ' virus which is carried by ticks			1
the @entity8 said the man , who is over 65 , was from @entity9 in north - east @entity2 and died from complications from the virus			1
the virus is found in the lone star tick and is spread through tick bites			1
an @entity2 man has died in the @entity4 of the new ' @entity6 ' virus which is carried by lone star ticks ( pictured ) it was first identified in @entity18 in 2009			1
the @entity19 has said the other patient who died had other health conditions			0
other cases have been diagnosed in @entity18 and @entity23 but those patients have recovered			1
similar to previous cases , the @entity2 victim had a history of outdoor activities and exposure , said @entity30 , an epidemiologist in acute disease with the @entity32			1
@entity9 where a man died from the virus			1
cases have also been recorded in @entity18 and @entity23 symptoms include fever , fatigue , headaches , muscle aches , loss of appetite , nausea , bruising easily and diarrhea			1
the lone star tick , @entity44 , is found throughout the eastern , southeastern and south - central states			1
they have been recorded in large numbers as far north as @entity48 and as far west as central @entity49 and @entity2			2
all three life stages ( larva , nymph , adult ) of the lone star tick will feed on humans , and may be quite aggressive			1
lone star ticks will also feed readily on other animals , including dogs and cats , and may be brought into the home on pets			1
the saliva from lone star ticks can be irritating ; redness and discomfort at a bite site does not necessarily indicate an infection			1
people should monitor their health closely after any tick bite , and should consult their physician if they experience a rash , fever , headache , joint or muscle pains , or swollen lymph nodes within 30 days of a tick bite			2
these can be signs of a number of tickborne diseases			0
there is no vaccine or drug to prevent or treat the illness			1
since its discovery , the @entity85 has killed two people and infected eight others			0
@entity30 said people who become ill after spending a lot of time outdoors should disclose to physicians if they have a history of tick bites to help reach a correct diagnosis			1
the incubation period before the onset of symptoms of the @entity6 virus is unknown but symptoms caused by other tick - borne illnesses generally begin two weeks after infection , @entity30 said			2
' we need to help doctors , ' she said			0
' we need to give them as much information as we can to give them some clues			0
' @entity30 said campers and others who spend a lot of time outdoors should check themselves ' at least daily ' for ticks			0
although there is no routine testing available for @entity6 virus , protocols are in place for investigational diagnostic testing			2
the state @entity32 recommends using insect repellents , wearing long - sleeved shirts and trousers when outdoors , avoiding bushy and wooded areas where ticks thrive and conducting thorough tick checks after spending time outside			2
' they can cause a lot of damage , ' said dr @entity129 , of the @entity130			0
according to dr @entity132 , @entity130 patients visit the health center during the spring and summer months			0
' we saw cases several times per week last summer , ' she said			0
an engorged female lone star tick which has been blamed for the @entity6 virus heartland virus belongs to a family of viruses called @entity144			1
viruses in this family are found all over the world			0
some of these viruses can cause people to get sick			0
most of the phleboviruses that cause people to become ill are passed through the bite of a mosquito , tick , or sandfly			0
it is not yet fully known how people become infected with @entity6 virus			0
however , recent studies suggest that ticks , namely @entity158 ticks , may transmit the virus			0
as of march 2014 , eight cases of heartland virus disease had been identified among residents of @entity18 and @entity23			1
since the @entity6 virus was first described in 2012 and there have only been a few cases , scientists are still learning about it			2
so far , all patients diagnosed with heartland virus disease became sick during may - september			1
they all had a fever and felt very tired			0
some also complained of headaches , muscle aches , diarrhea , losing their appetite , or feeling sick to their stomach			0
they all had low numbers of cells that fight infection and that help blood clot			0
most patients required hospitalisation for their illness			2
most patients fully recovered , but now two patients have died			2
people who work or do activities outside , where they are exposed to ticks or insects , may be more likely to be infected			0
there is no vaccine or drug to prevent or treat the disease			1
preventing bites from ticks and mosquitoes may prevent this and other infections .			2
