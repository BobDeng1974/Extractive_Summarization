tragedy : @entity1 passed away in early december after contracting the flu three children have died in @entity4 from what health officials are warning parents is a particularly virulent strain of seasonal flu			1
seven other children are currently being treated at the intensive care unit of the @entity12 in @entity13			0
worringly , the flu has proved fatal to children with no apparent underlying health problems and statistics from the @entity4 @entity18 have revealed that in some parts of the state up to 50 percent of students have been absent in december battling the illness			1
dr. @entity23 of the @entity24 explained that even in healthy children , the virus can cause the body to battle itself , sending white blood cells flooding into the lungs to compensate and lead to fatal consequences			2
' the virus can enter the blood stream and then the brain , creating severe respiratory symptoms including shortness of breath and a very high fever , ' he said to @entity38			2
' if the body 's reaction to the virus is too vigorous , this can cause as much damage as the virus itself , ' he said			0
indeed , 17 - year - old @entity1 , a senior at @entity45 died at the @entity24 in early december from the flu			1
initially falling ill with a fever and sore throat , @entity1 deteriorated at home and her heart stopped beating while she was in her mother 's arms after being sick for one week			1
' the dominant strain appears to be @entity62 , which in previous seasons meant there were more hospitalizations , more deaths and more disease in general , ' said @entity68 , a state health epidemiologist to the @entity69			0
earlier in the month the @entity70 sent an advisory to doctors noting that one component of this year 's flu vaccine was only partially protective against the predominant flu virus , known as influenza a ( @entity77 ) , which has mutated since the current flu shots were made			1
@entity70 director dr. @entity79 said it takes four months to make a new flu vaccine even using newer cell - based technologies , too long to be helpful in the current flu season			0
past seasons dominated by @entity77 strains of flu have been severe , and the worry is that without a good match in this year 's flu shot , many people could be hospitalized or die from flu this year			0
@entity79 encouraged people who have not been vaccinated to get a flu shot because it could still offer partial protection against the mutated @entity77 virus and good protection from other strains that might become predominant later this year			2
@entity70 testing shows the vaccine offers good protection from about half of the @entity77 flu strains circulating , as well as @entity105 and influenza b strains .			0

seasonal virus has mutated and has *swept* @entity4
*teenagers* with no underlying conditions have been worst *affected*
@entity1 , 17 , died earlier this month after being sick with the flu for a week
