by @entity0 last updated at 10:35 am on 16th december 2011 according to a report emergency hospital admissions for neurological conditions have risen by around a third the number of people suffering from neurological disorders has increased , despite extra spending a report has shown			1
according to the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) emergency hospital admissions for conditions such as @entity9 's , multiple sclerosis and motor neurone diseases have risen by around a third			1
it also revealed patient care has ' worsened ' recommending that the @entity15 needs to implement more effective strategies to remedy the situation			0
the quality of care , coordination of health and social services , variability in access to services around the country , and poor budget control have have been cited as key areas of concern			0
between 2006/07 ( £ 2.1 billion ) and 2009/10 ( £ 2.9 billion ) there was a 38 per cent increase in spending on neurological services with an estimated £ 2.4 billion spent on social services associated with such conditions			1
however extra money was never ring - fenced in local health budgets and the @entity15 is unable to say how the increased spend has benefited services			1
@entity40 , head of the @entity12 , said : ' services for people with long - term neurological conditions are not as good as they ought to be , despite a large increase in spending			1
' progress in implementing the @entity15 's strategy has been poor and local organisations lack incentives to improve the quality of services			1
' it is not clear how lessons will be learnt and there are risks to services which the @entity15 must address to ensure that care improves			0
' the report revealed that patients admitted as an emergency are often treated by doctors and nurses with no neurological training			2
one study found that only 66 per cent of people with @entity9 were seen by a specialist within six weeks of referral by their gp , despite national guidelines on the issue			1
evidence suggests this can lead to poorer outcomes as many have to be referred to hospital , discharged and referred again			2
the report revealed that patients admitted as an emergency are often treated by doctors and nurses with no neurological training @entity80 , chief executive of @entity81 , said : ' being admitted into hospital unnecessarily can cause problems for people with @entity9 's because they often do not get their medication on time			1
' late or missed medication can make their symptoms unmanageable so they have to stay in hospital longer and sometimes they may never recover			2
' the report also criticised the management of a national framework for neurology introduced in 2005 , saying the @entity15 ' put in place no specific arrangements for monitoring how commissioners implemented ' it			0
in response to the findings , which support a previous audit from the @entity102 and @entity103 , minister of state for care services @entity104 reassured that new strategies are in the pipeline			0
' we are determined to give people with long - term health conditions more control over their care and support			2
' that is why we are developing a new outcomes strategy , piloting personal health budgets and rolling out telehealth to deliver better results for people and make sound use of @entity121 resources			0
' the @entity12 has called for the @entity15 and @entity121 commissioners to implement a future strategy for long - term conditions focusing on better coordination of services and improved motoring to ensure budgets are being used effectively			0
the report did note access to services have improved along with shorter waiting times			0
it is estimated around two million people have a neurological condition in the @entity136 .			0
