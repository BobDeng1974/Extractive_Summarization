@entity0 had a point when complaining about refereeing decisions which cost @entity3 in their 2 - 2 with @entity4 but @entity5 ca n’t be blamed for all of them			1
those who do n’t think video replays will help football should review the incident when @entity11 handled the ball inside his own penalty area			1
whilst some might try and argue that @entity11 ’s arm is down by his side in a natural position , there is clear movement of it towards the ball in a deliberate way but @entity23 and his colleagues had obstructed views and so just could not award the penalty that @entity3 deserved			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity11 appeared to handle the ball in the area when @entity3 were 1 - 0 up incensing @entity0 @entity11 celebrates levelling for @entity4 against @entity30 during the second half a video replay would have enabled them to award the penalty which @entity3 deserved and will help when a referee is unsighted			1
the same could not be said of @entity37 ’s nudge on @entity38 which meant the @entity3 captain did n’t get a clean header away and enabled @entity4 to rebuild their attack and feed the ball through for @entity44 to score			2
@entity37 impressed on his debut for @entity4 against @entity3 @entity46 can only watch on as @entity44 's shot flies past him into the net to put @entity4 ahead @entity44 celebrates putting @entity4 2 - 1 up against @entity3 at the @entity50 stadium i can only assume that @entity5 was watching the area from where the cross came rather than the central area as he could n’t have missed the nudge had he been looking			1
the other complaints about a foul in the build up to @entity4 ’s first goal and the fact that @entity5 ‘ had a very , very bad day ’ revealed a deeper lying issue between the manager of the champions and @entity65 ’s leading referee			2
@entity66 has an issue with @entity23 which goes back over a number of games			2
he truly believes that @entity23 appears to be consistently going against his team			0
the @entity71 is not a manager who plays mind games so this is a genuine belief which he must resolve in his mind and perhaps a meeting would be beneficial between the two			0
@entity77 is a superb centre forward who plays like an old fashioned ‘ @entity81 ’ target man			0
he is no lightweight ‘ soft ’ foreigner and was incorrectly cautioned in his first game for ‘ diving ’			0
there was evidence of the more robust nature of @entity77 ’s play when he pushed @entity89 ’s @entity88 away strongly after he was being held on the edge of the penalty area			0
perhaps he could have been cautioned had @entity92 been slavish to law , but there was nothing i saw to suggest he was fortunate not to be sent off and not being cautioned perhaps ‘ levelled things up ’ after his first caution at @entity99 .			0

@entity0 *vented* his *frustration* out at @entity5 after he failed to award a penalty to his side when they were 1 - 0 up against @entity4
@entity11 had appeared to handle the ball in the area
the game ended up *finishing* 2 - 2 at the @entity50 stadium
however @entity0 must settle his issues with @entity23 which go back a number of games prior to this clash taking place
