@entity0 has been stunned after allegations of rape were made against @entity3 , pictured the silence was excruciating			1
@entity3 and @entity5 , his wife of 50 years , were sitting in the @entity7 in @entity8 , surrounded by valuable works of @entity11 art from their private collection , lent for an exhibition			1
moments earlier , the veteran @entity0 tv star had been basking in adulation			1
his generosity had been praised in saturday ’s interview for @entity18 , @entity0 ’s equivalent of @entity20			1
then the conversation took an ugly turn			0
‘ this question gives me no pleasure , ’ began presenter @entity23 , before asking @entity3 about ‘ serious accusations raised against you in recent days ’			1
he did n’t need to spell out what they were			0
@entity0 has been stunned as several women have come forward to accuse @entity3 of drugging and raping them in a series of incidents over several decades			1
some allegedly took place when his sitcom @entity36 ruled @entity37 and its star was held up as a model of wholesome family values			2
after a pause for 77 - year - old @entity3 to respond , @entity23 said : ‘ you ’re shaking your head			1
i have to ask the question — do you have a response to those charges ? ’ @entity23 tried twice more — and there were two more significant pauses — before he gave up and thanked the couple			1
only mrs @entity50 , with whom the star has five children , thanked @entity23 in return			1
on tuesday , model and reality tv star @entity54 accused @entity3 of raping her , claiming she was attacked after a dinner at a @entity58 resort in 1982			1
@entity54 , 59 , said @entity3 gave her a pill and a glass of wine after she complained of stomach pains			1
the last thing she recalled before passing out , she alleged , was ‘ @entity3 in a patchwork robe , dropping his robe and getting on top of me			1
and i remember a lot of pain ’			0
@entity3 ’s lawyer has denied the allegations , calling her story ‘ a complete lie ’			1
but a day after @entity54 spoke out , @entity74 became the seventh woman to say publicly that @entity3 sexually assaulted her			1
she said she was a starstruck 19 - year - old when he chatted her up in a @entity78 hotel , before giving her powerful tranquiliser pills			0
she alleged she came round to find they were having sex and accused him of ‘ using his fame and power to come after people ’s innocence ’			2
@entity54 , pictured , is one of the latest celebrities to claim to have been drugged and raped by @entity3 last night , the wife of @entity91 actor @entity90 became the latest to publicly accuse @entity3 of sexual assault			1
@entity93 claimed he grabbed her and forcibly kissed her when she was a teenager at his house after a double date in 1967 , before she pushed him off			0
millions of shocked fans and admirers are now watching the rapid disintegration of the reputation of the man once dubbed ‘ @entity101 ’			0
famous supporters , such as actress @entity103 , have leapt to @entity3 ’s defence , but broadcasters are running scared			1
@entity106 has scrapped plans to make a new family sitcom featuring the comic and the internet streaming service @entity111 has ‘ postponed ’ a comedy special starring him			0
the idea that such a prominent black role model , who tours the country lecturing @entity117 on the importance of family , has feet of clay is almost too painful to contemplate in a racially divided @entity0			0
praised by presidents and courted by corporations , @entity3 became indistinguishable from the man he played on @entity36 — dr @entity124 , the loving patriarch of a middle - class family in @entity126			1
@entity3 played dr @entity124 in @entity36 between 1984 and 1992 on the @entity106 network the @entity106 show , then the most popular on @entity37 , ran from 1984 to 1992			1
in @entity130 , it was one of @entity133 ’s most popular shows , ground - breaking in portraying black people in a happy family that was affluent and successful			0
that many @entity117 are hearing for the first time there may be a sinister side to @entity3 is testament , say some , to the power of his pr machine and the reluctance of the establishment to criticise him			1
for many of these accusations were first made nearly ten years ago			0
how could this have happened ? one possible explanation lies in the way that interviewer @entity23 was then hounded on social media for ‘ ambushing ’ @entity3			1
many might wonder if it ’s ever wrong to bring up repeated accusations of rape but , astonishingly , they have been barely mentioned over the years			0
@entity3 has always rejected the claims against him , and has never been charged over them — let alone convicted			2
a new authorised biography did n’t refer to the allegations once , and nor did its review in the liberal @entity159 , which praised it as ‘ wonderfully thorough ’			2
the same glaring omission was repeated in @entity3 ’s recent tv interviews to mark the upcoming 30th anniversary of @entity36			1
chatshow host @entity164 instead gushed : ‘ i ’m going to say something controversial			0
i think you ’re great			0
’ several @entity0 journalists have said that editors spiked stories which addressed alleged sexual abuse even when , a few years ago , @entity3 was promoting a campaign for better behaviour in the black community , interviewers including @entity172 did n’t deign to mention the subject			1
in recent days , several @entity0 journalists admitted their attempts to publicise the allegations were spiked by editors who were , as one put it , ‘ horrified at the prospect of taking down ’ a ‘ beloved figure and civil rights pioneer ’			2
footage has also emerged of an interview @entity3 gave a few days ago , before the latest claims , to the @entity188 news agency , in which the star tried to shame the reporter for daring to bring up the allegations			1
‘ i do n’t talk about it , ’ he said			0
some have suggested that fear of being labelled racist may have protected him			0
‘ i recognise @entity3 as a comedic genius , and black people — with good reason — do n’t throw away our geniuses , ’ said black academic @entity196			2
‘ far too often , racism becomes an excuse for us not to confront sexism			0
’ if that was the case , it is no longer			0
another alleged victim , @entity206 — a former publicist to reggae star @entity207 — also revealed herself this week			2
she says she was 19 when @entity3 sexually assaulted her twice in 1969 , while supposedly helping her get on in the industry			2
the first time , ms @entity206 says she woke up on his couch after he had given her a drink			0
@entity3 had raped her , she says , but her parents idolised the star and , ‘ ashamed ’ , she kept quiet			1
on the second occasion , she claims she felt very dizzy after he gave her a drink and later awoke naked in his hotel suite bed			0
the accusers ’ stories about being drugged and attacked are eerily similar			0
so too are their claims that they were ignored by the entertainment industry and discouraged from contacting the police			0
ironically , the allegations have only gained traction because another popular @entity11 - @entity0 comic , @entity225 , called @entity3 a rapist in his act last month			1
@entity3 ’s publicist has said the star would not dignify ‘ decade - old , discredited ’ claims with a response			1
but sceptics challenged his claim that they were ‘ discredited ’			0
they were first made in 2005 by @entity233 , a university basketball star whom @entity3 was mentoring			1
she said he had given her ‘ herbal ’ pills to ease her anxiety			0
having drugged her , @entity3 then molested her , she claimed			2
one alleged victim claimed @entity3 , pictured , claimed he was ' scouting for talent ' when he attacked her authorities chose not to file criminal charges			2
this week , @entity241 , the former prosecutor who investigated @entity3 , said he had thought the star was ‘ probably guilty ’ but there had been insufficient evidence			1
but @entity233 went ahead with a civil lawsuit and 13 more women agreed to testify as anonymous witnesses , citing similar accusations			0
@entity3 , who claimed his relationship with @entity233 had been consensual , settled out of court for an undisclosed amount in 2006			2
but three of the women who had agreed to testify soon came forward			2
@entity254 , a @entity58 lawyer , said she had been assaulted in the @entity255 , but only spoke out when she realised she would n’t be alone			0
she alleged she was a 19 - year - old model when @entity3 , whom she knew socially , gave her pills which he said would sort out a cold			1
when he offered to put her to bed , she said , she tried to fight him off but passed out			0
@entity3 said he did n’t know her			2
another former young model , @entity260 , claimed she had a relationship with @entity3 in the mid-eighties which ended after he drugged her coffee and she awoke in a car with her clothes in disarray			2
the third woman , @entity267 , had been an aspiring 17 - year - old actress when her agent told her @entity3 was ‘ scouting for young talent ’			2
she alleged the star had been a ‘ monster ’ who pinned her by her neck as he unbuckled his belt			0
her thought , she has said , was : ‘ who ’s gon na believe this ? he was a powerful man			0
he was like the president			0
’ @entity3 ’s defenders insist the women are trying to cash in on his money and fame			1
@entity103 has questioned why ms @entity267 did n’t go to police or get a hospital to confirm she had been raped			0
the @entity0 statute of limitations on the alleged assaults ran out long ago , meaning @entity3 can not be tried or sued in any court			2
these women insist they have nothing to gain other than what they see as long - delayed justice .			0
