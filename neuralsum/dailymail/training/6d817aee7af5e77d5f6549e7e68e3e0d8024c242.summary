shivering in the cold before dawn yesterday , more than 30 patients queue in the desperate hope of seeing a doctor			1
the scene , a bleak picture of a health service in crisis , is one repeated daily in many parts of the country			2
the patients lined up from 6.30am because it was their only hope of a same - day appointment with their gp at a heavily oversubscribed practice			1
the @entity16 in @entity17 is one of the biggest in @entity19			1
the @entity16 in @entity17 is one of the biggest in @entity19 originally designed for 6,000 patients , it now serves nearly 19,000			1
residents say the extra demand is a result of new housing developments springing up while few improvements have been made to health services			1
the surgery has 12 gps , four of them recruited in the past two years to cope with increased demand , and hopes to recruit more			2
as its roll has increased , so has the @entity40 money flowing in – surgeries are paid £ 73.56 per patient , according to @entity42			2
but patients at @entity16 say the phone is continuously engaged so it is ‘ impossible ’ to ring for an appointment			1
if they do manage to book by phone , they face a wait of up to two weeks to see a doctor			1
the surgery is open weekdays from 7am until 6pm and like many across the country does not offer appointments in the evenings or at weekends – @entity57 ’s 2004 changes to gp contracts allowed them to opt out of providing care outside office hours			2
patients say the only option is to queue in the hope of seeing a doctor on the same day			1
those queuing yesterday would otherwise not be seen until well into the new year			0
retired nurse @entity66 , 63 , was trying to get an appointment for her five - month - old grandson @entity68			2
she said : ‘ i ’m queuing for my grandchild who is ill with bronchiolitis			0
you ca n’t bring a sick baby to queue in the cold at 7am			2
the nearest surgeries other than this are miles away			2
’ waiting in line : wrapped up against the cold , patients queue outside			1
they say the phone is continuously engaged so it is ‘ impossible ’ to ring for an appointment at this heavily subscribed health centre @entity83 , 36 , an @entity84 manager , said : ‘ it ’s absolutely ridiculous			0
it ’s the third time i ’ve been down here in the past week			0
the first time i did n’t manage to get an appointment , the second time i did but i had to stand in the rain and then again today			0
’ @entity93 , 50 , a secretary , said : ‘ what if you are elderly and living on your own ? you ca n’t expect them to come and queue			0
the surgery ca n’t take any more			0
’ chauffeur @entity100 , 54 , tried to book an appointment by phone but was told the earliest date was january 5			0
he said : ‘ i had no choice but to come down here			0
i ’ve been here since 7am queuing			0
’ the scene is not unique as @entity110 surgeries across the country are being stretched to breaking point			1
in september the @entity113 reported @entity40 figures predicting that this year 58.9million gp appointments will have entailed a wait of a week or more – a rise of almost 50 per cent on 2012			1
and the queue in @entity16 may continue to grow unless something is done – the surgery expects a further 4,000 patients will sign up in the next three years			1
the practice has been lobbying for a new premises or money to redevelop the existing surgery			0
it said in its newsletter that it was trying to recruit more staff and doing its best to deliver ‘ excellent primary care ’			0
@entity130 , @entity131 mp for the @entity133 constituency which includes @entity16 , said : ‘ we have been trying to work this out with @entity136 and we have not got as far as i would like			0
it ’s bursting at the seams and it ca n’t continue much longer			0
’ a spokesman for @entity16 said there had been an increase in patients seeking appointments before the @entity145 holidays			0
it added : ‘ we are currently reviewing our system			0
although there may be a queue on certain mornings , all patients who require an appointment will be seen or telephoned by a gp the same day			1
’ desperate : patients say the only option is to queue in the hope of seeing a doctor on the same day			1
the scene pictured above is not unique as @entity110 surgeries across the country are being stretched to breaking point @entity136 said : ‘ we are aware of the challenges faced by @entity16 and we are working closely with the practice to support them			1
’ dr @entity164 , chairman of the @entity165 , said : ‘ every patient should be able to see their family doctor when they need to			0
unfortunately , what we are seeing now is a sad consequence of the desperate shortage of gps in many parts of the country			0
’ some patients are bypassing @entity110 surgeries to go to @entity178 , putting huge pressure on the emergency services			1
last month health secretary @entity181 admitted taking his children to @entity178 over a weekend because he did n’t want to wait for a @entity110 appointment			1
a conservative health spokesman said : ‘ eighty - five per cent of patients say they can get access to a @entity110 quickly , but we know services are under pressure – that ’s why a future @entity191 government would guarantee seven - day access for everyone by 2020			2
