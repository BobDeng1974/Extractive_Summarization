@entity0 will win the @entity1 again this season if all referees are as benevolent as @entity4 was at the @entity5			1
@entity4 appeared somehow to miss what can only be described as a flying karate kick by @entity8 on @entity10 ’s @entity9 as the @entity12 man jumped in for an aerial ball			1
sometimes players are defended when they catch opponents but there can be no excuse in this case - it should have been a red card			0
@entity8 ( left ) of @entity0 appears to karate kick @entity10 's @entity9 ( right ) @entity4 was extremely lenient and if @entity0 get referees like him all season they will win the title after a delay , @entity4 did show @entity8 a yellow card , which should mean the @entity25 can not act on the clear video evidence			1
@entity27 came the champions ’ penalty when @entity30 and @entity31 came together just inside the @entity10 penalty area			0
@entity30 went to ground and was scrambling to get to his feet to continue playing when @entity4 awarded the penalty			0
@entity30 ( right ) goes down when under pressure from @entity31 to win a penalty @entity38 makes no mistake as he converts his penalty to give @entity0 the lead at the @entity5 @entity0 's @entity42 ( left ) kicks @entity43 with his boot at head height but escapes punishment in the second half , @entity47 challenged @entity43 with his boot at head height and despite appearing to catch @entity43 , he escaped with a yellow card			1
if there was contact then he , too , should have been dismissed			0
@entity4 ’s final act was to caution @entity10 ’s @entity55 for simulation after he went down under a challenge from @entity58 - there was clear contact so the caution was wrong			2
all in all , a bad day for the referee but a good one for @entity0			0
@entity55 of @entity10 ( right ) went down under a challenge from @entity58 but was booked @entity4 decided that @entity55 had dived and booked the midfielder for simulation			2

@entity0 beat @entity10 1 - 0 at the @entity5 on *saturday*
@entity38 's penalty after @entity30 went down settled the game
@entity4 gave @entity0 a penalty but booked @entity55 for simulation when he went down under a similar challenge late on
he also failed to send off @entity8 for karate kick on @entity9
if @entity0 get referees as benevolent as @entity4 they will win the title
