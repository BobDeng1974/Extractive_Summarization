the decision came following an email which was reportedly sent to the schools by @entity22			2
the memo advised schools to read a leaflet from the @entity26 on how to observe an eclipse safely			1
advice in the leaflet states that ' the sun is so bright that just looking at it can blind you , so you 'll need to prepare beforehand '			2
