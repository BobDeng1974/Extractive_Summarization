a @entity1 woman has found a way to help a convicted murderer on death row see the world - she superimposes his face on pictures of famous landmarks			2
@entity9 , 29 , from @entity10 , has been writing to @entity12 inmate @entity11 , whom she believes has been unfairly convicted of murdering both his neighbour and a prison guard , every week since march			1
by photoshopping images of @entity11 's head on to popular tourist sites , miss @entity9 has been helping her unlikely pen pal feel like he 's travelling the globe			1
@entity9 is helping her death row pen pal @entity11 see the world from his prison cell by sending him images of his face photoshopped on to famous landmarks , like this one of the @entity24 after seeing @entity26 convict @entity11 ( right ) on a @entity28 documentary in march this year , care worker @entity9 from @entity10 ( left ) found his prison address online and wrote to him the very same night the senior care assistant , who lives with her mother , has already ' transported ' @entity11 to @entity32 , @entity33 and the @entity34 in the hope of providing him with some escapism from his life in prison			1
she has created pictures of @entity11 in front of sites including the @entity42 in @entity43 , the @entity44 and the @entity45 in @entity10			1
miss @entity9 said : ' if somebody had told me five years ago i would have been writing to a man on death row , i would have said , " ' yeah , whatever "			1
but times have changed for @entity51 , who now says she feels like the convicted murderer is a lifelong friend			2
the senior care assistant created superimposed pictures of @entity11 at sites including the @entity42 in @entity43 says miss @entity9 : ' i got the idea to do the first picture after he wrote and mentioned he 'd always wanted to visit the @entity34 and i used an editing app to show him standing in front of a harbour on the island ' ' i was so shocked about how much we have clicked			1
i feel like i 've known him forever and he 's told me he sees us as really good friends , ' the @entity63 whiz explains			2
miss @entity9 , who says she prizes herself on being ' a good judge of character ' , had an inkling her mother would disapprove of the friendship , despite being convinced of her convicted murderer 's innocence			1
' even though i knew he was innocent , i did n't say anything to my mum at first about writing to him			2
' luckily for miss @entity9 , her mother was more understanding than she had imagined			1
' she 's been really supportive since i told her - she can see he 's not a bad person			2
i am lucky to have her support , but even if she was against it , it would n't affect my friendship with @entity11			1
i am nearly 30 , after all			0
' some of my friends do worry about me writing to someone who 's in jail for murder , but i 'm not in any danger			0
' a photoshopped picture of @entity11 visiting @entity10 , where miss @entity9 herself is from @entity11 with his favourite band @entity92 : says miss @entity9 : ' this was much harder to make as you have these rock stars and then a white - faced convict in the middle in his boiler suit ' says miss @entity9 of the man on death row : ' @entity11 is n't in a dark place any more			1
he is a really positive person and is quite happy in himself			0
' ' he loves every minute of life			0
he tries to love the now , tries to be as happy as he can be			0
he loves to have a laugh , so i always put silly stories or memories in my emails			0
' in one , i told him about getting attacked by a spider that day - just daft things like that			0
despite having virtually travelled the globe together , miss @entity9 and her convict have never met in the flesh , but the @entity10 is hoping that moment will come			1
' he says he really wants to meet me and i ca n't wait to meet him			0
i think when we meet face to face , it 'll be just the same as writing to each other			0
we 've got loads to talk about			0
' miss @entity9 learnt of 34 - year - old @entity11 's criminal background , when she saw his story on @entity28 documentary @entity122			1
left : @entity11 superimposed onto a @entity124 bus ; right : miss @entity9 in action writing to her pen pal he was jailed in 1995 at the age of 16 , convicted for the fatal stabbing of a neighbour in @entity131 , @entity12			1
then four years into a 99 - year sentence , @entity11 was found guilty of murdering a prison guard who was repeatedly stabbed with a sharpened metal rod , and given the death sentence			1
miss @entity9 said : ' we never talk about his case , because when i write to him i want to take him out of that reality			1
' we just chat like normal pen pals do about music , films , funny memories and places in the world we would love to see			2
' the only difference is that he 'll never get that chance to see them			0
at least with the pictures i make , he can imagine himself there			0
' i got the idea to do the first picture after he wrote and mentioned he 'd always wanted to visit the @entity34 and i used an editing app on my mobile phone to show him standing in front of a harbour on the island			0
' he wrote back to say he loved it so in my next letter i attached a photo of him superimposed on top of a double - decker @entity124 bus , as he 'd talked about visiting the city			2
' i 've done pictures of him with his favourite band @entity92 too , although that was much harder to make as you have these rock stars and then a white - faced convict in the middle in his boiler suit			1
' miss @entity9 is also campaigning for her pen pal to be retried after doubts were expressed over his convictions			1
@entity11 , above , was jailed in 1995 at the age of 16 , over the fatal stabbing of a neighbour in @entity131 , @entity12 , then four years into a 99 - year sentence he was convicted of murdering a prison guard a collectiom of @entity11 's letters written from his prison in @entity12 to miss @entity9 in @entity10 @entity11 's father , who admitted killing the neighbour , testified to say his son did not take part in the murder and two fellow inmates who testified against @entity11 over the death of the prison guard were given reduced sentences			1
his execution date was originally set for may last year at the @entity196 prison			2
but , with the support of the @entity198 which fights for wrongfully convicted prisoners , he received a stay of execution so further dna testing could be carried out			0
she said : ' after watching the @entity28 documentary , and doing my own research , it 's clear there is n't a scrap of evidence against @entity11			1
' from the first moment , i just knew he was n't guilty , so i took it upon myself to write to him and let him know			0
' @entity11 ( right ) is serving 99 years in a @entity12 jail for two murders , but miss @entity9 ( left ) is convinced of her new friend 's innocence ' now i 've got to know him , i 'm even more convinced that he did n't commit these crimes , ' she says			1
' i am very passionate about @entity11 's case			2
i have n't stopped thinking about it			0
if we could just get his sentence reduced or get him off death row , it would be a huge triumph			0
' an innocent man is going to die and i want to make people realise that he has not done anything wrong			0
there is not even a pinhead of @entity230 against him			0
he just wants a retrial to prove he is innocent			0
' @entity11 is currently compiling an online journal about his incarceration where entries are published for him via a friend in @entity236			2
he writes : ' being on death watch and knowing you could be soon executed is intense and there are ups and downs to it , but you do n't have to be overwhelmed by it all			2
staying present is the key			0
