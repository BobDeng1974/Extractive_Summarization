by @entity0 to the untrained eye they look just as they are , a row of old garages ideal for storage space			0
but to those experienced in playing the property market and investing in hidden gems , the innocuous buildings were too tempting to resist			0
the six garages , in @entity12 , @entity13 have sold for a staggering £ 700,000 - ten times their value , after sparking a bidding war when they went under the hammer			1
the properties were sold by @entity19 , who had valued the row at £ 75,000			1
this row of six garages in @entity12 , @entity23 in @entity13 has sold for £ 700,000 - ten times their £ 75,000 value the garages , which each have a rental potential of £ 65 a month , were sold without planning permission for development			1
but that did not deter interest , with a flurry of bids in what auctioneers have branded ' a first '			0
the anonymous buyer , who is understood to be a developer , secured the garages for £ 700,000 - four times the average @entity42 house price , and one - and - a - half times the value of a typical @entity13 property			1
they will now have to submit proposals to planning chiefs at @entity49 and @entity23 council			0
@entity51 @entity50 said : ' we price things very well and we 're used to seeing £ 400,000 houses selling for a £ 100,000 premium but we 're having to recalculate values			2
' they had a guide price of £ 75,000 and ended up selling for £ 700,000			1
i 've never seen anything like this before			0
' the garages were owned by a couple who inherited and they could n't believe it , they were pleasantly surprised			0
' the garages , which are off @entity69 - where average property prices are around £ 615,000 - were sold to an anonymous buyer who is understood to be a developer			2
the properties came without planning permission the sellers , who inherited the garages and had been renting them out , are understood to have carried out a feasibility study with a view to building two , two - bedroom townhouses on the site prior to the sale , the owners were renting three of the garages out for £ 65 , £ 80 and £ 85 per month			1
if they were to carry on renting at these rates , it would take more than 250 years to make £ 700,000 from them			2
the auction house advertised the freehold terrace of garages as ' suitable for redevelopment subject to planning permission '			1
it is understood the sellers had conducted a feasibility scheme to redevelop the site with a likely workable scheme of two , two bedroom townhouses			2
two - bedroom flats and houses in @entity12 can reach between £ 550,000 to more than £ 1million , depending on the size of the property			1
property valuation site @entity104 estimates the average property price in the area , just off @entity69 , is £ 615,714 - up nearly £ 60,000 in the last year			1
mr @entity50 added : ' it was quite unusual and a very fun part of the auction			0
it is a prime part of @entity23 , but it 's also a gamble			0
' the garages are clearly not worth £ 700,000 as they are so the buyer has obviously got a plan for it and it will be interesting to see what it is			2
' it is a perfect storm of shortage of stock and strong market forces			0
it is an unpredictable market , but it is great for sellers			0
