by @entity0 published : 05:34 est , 17 february 2013 updated : 06:06 est , 17 february 2013 crackdown : @entity1 spoke with finance ministers from the @entity3 about cracking down on firms not paying corporate tax public outrage over corporate tax avoidance must be used as a ' catalyst for change ' in the @entity10 and the developing world , chancellor @entity1 said			1
mr @entity1 was in @entity12 yesterday for a meeting of finance ministers from the @entity3 group of major economies which pledged to find ways to crack down on dodges by multinationals			1
@entity10 , @entity19 and @entity20 are spearheading a push for international agreement on measures to end practices such as ' transfer pricing ' where profits are diverted to low - tax countries			1
it follows claims of immoral behaviour by number of high - profile firms who have paid little or no corporation tax in the @entity10 by exploiting legal loopholes			1
but there have also been claims that @entity10 firms are guilty of depriving poor countries of tax revenues as well - something the chancellor said the @entity10 would use its presidency of the @entity43 on which to push action			1
writing in the @entity47 , he said : ' this year , we have an opportunity to turn concern over tax avoidance into a catalyst for change , creating a competitive tax system that supports businesses , but where everyone pays their fair share			0
' through our role in the @entity3 and our leadership of the @entity43 , we can ensure this change benefits @entity10 's taxpayers and also helps meet our commitments to the poorest in our society			1
' mr @entity1 defended the government 's decision to protect foreign aid spending from deep public spending cuts so next year it could meet a @entity70 target to spend 0.7 per cent of gdp on overseas development			0
apart from saving lives and boosting education , it would be used to strengthen countries ' abilities to enforce tax rules , he said			0
anger : web giant @entity80 avoided paying $ 2billion in tax last year by moving around 80 per cent of its overseas profits to a company in the tax haven of @entity86 @entity87 has more than 700 outlets in the @entity10 generating revenues of more than £ 3billion but it paid just £ 8.6million in corporation tax in its 14 years of trading in the @entity10 and nothing in the last three ' since we came into office , tax collection in @entity96 has increased by 40 per cent			2
this is just one example - we are also involved in projects in @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			0
embarrassing : shadow chancellor @entity103 said @entity10 's economy had flatlined over two years which was n't good enough ' we will champion a new agenda of transparency and accountability in developing countries			2
' with the authority that comes from meeting our international commitments on aid , @entity10 is well placed to tackle the causes , not just the symptoms of poverty , such as corruption and lack of transparency			0
' @entity117 said @entity119 library figures showed the @entity10 was in the @entity3 ' relegation zone ' in terms of economic growth since the chancellor 's autumn 2010 spending review			1
shadow chancellor @entity103 said : ' these are embarrassing figures for @entity1 as he attends the meeting of @entity3 countries this weekend			2
' @entity10 has now flatlined for over two and a half years under this @entity129 - led government			2
' in the global growth league table we 're in the relegation zone with 17 out of 20 countries including @entity134 , @entity19 and @entity20 doing better than us			1
' this is n't good enough			0
the longer our economy stagnates the worse off people will be and the more long - term damage will be done			0
' we need urgent action now to kick - start our flatlining economy and help people struggling with the rising cost of living			0
our jobs plan includes building thousands of affordable homes and giving tax breaks to small firms taking on extra workers			0
