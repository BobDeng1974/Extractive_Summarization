@entity5 , seven , made sure his two - year - old brother , @entity6 , did not panic before calling for help when his mother , @entity8 , collapsed			1
ms @entity8 , who has type 1 diabetes , was at home in @entity11 , @entity12 , with her sons when her blood sugar level plummeted causing her to collapse			1
@entity5 ( left ) , seven , called for help and looked after his brother , @entity6 ( right ) , two , when his mother , @entity8 ( centre ) , collapsed at home			1
ms @entity8 has been a type 1 diabetic for 15 years ms @entity8 , 30 , said : ‘ i ’d just come out of hospital after suffering from a viral infection and so my blood sugar was a bit all over the place			1
‘ i was on my own with the boys at home , and when i could feel my blood sugar dipping , i had a chocolate bar and a drink to try and stabilise it			2
‘ but the next thing i knew i was waking up and everyone was standing around me			0
two of my neighbours were there and half of my family were all staring at me			0
’ ms @entity8 and her partner @entity35 , 34 , have taught @entity5 what to do if he can not wake his mother up			1
‘ we have always told him that if ever he ca n’t wake me , he needs to call for help , ’ ms @entity8 said			1
‘ he knows how to use my @entity40 and he can find the numbers for various family members			0
when his mother collapsed , @entity5 ( centre ) walked across a busy road with his brother to find his neighbours , @entity47 ( left ) and @entity48 ( right ) who called an ambulance ‘ i have been diabetic for 15 years and from @entity5 being an early age he has seen me injecting myself on a daily basis , so i thought it was important to tell him what i am doing			1
‘ i also did n’t want him thinking it was something he should try			0
’ when ms @entity8 collapsed , @entity5 took care of @entity6 , and led him safely across a busy road to knock on a neighbour ’s door , before calling his aunt , @entity60			1
an ambulance was called and paramedics rushed to the scene to give ms @entity8 a potentially life - saving glucose injection to bring her back to consciousness			1
if @entity5 had not found help , ms @entity8 could have slipped into a diabetic coma or even died			1
ms @entity8 says that she has taught @entity5 ( right ) what to do in an emergency so he knew that when he could not wake her he should go and find their neighbour , @entity48 ( left ) the proud mother praised quick - thinking @entity5 for coming to the rescue			1
ms @entity8 said : ‘ our front garden goes straight out onto the road so i worry about him crossing that on his own			1
ms @entity8 ( pictured ) said : ' i 'm really proud and i ca n't get over how grown - up he was			1
he 's my hero ' ‘ but when he knocked on the neighbour ’s door , he and @entity6 were standing there holding hands			2
he was really looking after him			0
‘ i ’m really proud and i ca n’t get over how grown - up he was			0
‘ if it was n’t for him , i might not still be here today			0
’ the schoolboy is now set for a special treat , to thank him for his brave efforts			0
ms @entity8 said : ‘ we told him that we will give him a treat for all that he has done			2
‘ he will get a meal at his favourite restaurant and we are going to take him on a day trip wherever he wants to go			0
‘ we will be telling @entity6 what he needs to do in the future as well so they both know exactly what they have to do in an emergency			2
’ ms @entity60 , 33 , said : ‘ he is an absolute superstar			0
we always told him to get help if something happened and it just shows that he listened			0
’ @entity100 , director for @entity101 , said : ‘ a big well done to @entity5 for his actions and for staying calm when he faced what must have been a very difficult situation			0
‘ he did the right thing to get help for his mum and she must be very proud of him			0
’ type 1 diabetes develops when the insulin producing cells in the body have been destroyed and the body is unable to produce any insulin			1
this means that it is unable to regulate the body 's blood sugar levels			2
when the blood sugar levels fall too low this is known as a ' hypo ' - it occurs when the blood sugar level drops below four millimoles per litre			1
warning signs that blood sugar levels are falling include feeling hungry , trembling , sweating and difficulty concentrating			2
the best way of preventing a hypo is to eat or drink something sugary			0
if it is not treated , it can lead to unconsciousness , coma , and eventually death			0
the safest way for a diabetic to avoid a hypo is to regularly check their blood sugar and to eat regularly			2
