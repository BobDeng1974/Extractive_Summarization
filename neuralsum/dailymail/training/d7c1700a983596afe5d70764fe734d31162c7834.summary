@entity0 tastes : miss @entity1 she is the oscar winning actress turned self - proclaimed ‘ lifestyle coach ’ who believes that women can transform their lives by adopting healthy diets and fitness			2
now @entity1 has released a series of specialist recipes to help her followers launch themselves into a new year with a ‘ @entity12			2
’ but those not on @entity15 salaries may find @entity1 ’s latest creation a little too much to take – ingredients for her peppermint hot chocolate will cost £ 50			0
one of her previous culinary creations led a food critic to claim she had a ‘ @entity25 detachment from reality ’ and true to form , the recipe , published on her much - ridiculed lifestyle blog @entity21 , contains a number of highly expensive ingredients			1
among the baffling list are almond butter , mint flavoured liquid chlorophyl , spirulina powder and the optional addition of chocolate flavoured protein powder , that makes it sound more like the makings for a chemistry experiment than a hot drink			1
all this to disguise the fact that though the name may sound like an indulgent treat @entity1 ’s version of the cold day classic only contains a couple of tablespoons of raw cocoa and no sugar at all			2
instead , like all the recipes that feature in her detox it also avoids any dairy , gluten , shellfish , sugar , caffeine , condiments , alcohol and any other additives			1
fans who want to save themselves some cash may resort to leaving out the ‘ optional ’ chocolate protein powder but even without it the other ingredients are unlikely to be found for less than £ 38			0
it 's detox o'clock ! @entity1 , an avid foodie , has unveiled a january detox menu , which she promises does n't feel like a sacrifice and that is not to mention the fact that most the ingredients ca n’t be found in normal supermarkets and need a trip to specialised health food shops			1
opening the latest post on the site @entity1 writes : ‘ you know we love a good detox here at goop and this january is no exception			0
’ despite its prescriptive demands she promises readers that her three - day detox menu ‘ wo n’t leave you feeling cold and hungry during the winter ’ and offers eight recession - busting detox tips including ‘ take saunas ’ wear ‘ organic cotton			1
’ @entity1 has faced persistent criticism over the advice she posts on @entity21 with many mothers accusing her of having lost her a grip on the real world			2
she has spoken proudly about her daughter @entity99 ’s choice to become a vegetarian , a decision she came to ‘ entirely on her own ’ at the age of just seven			0
she also refuses to let @entity99 , now nine or seven - year - old son @entity104 eat gluten or dairy products and once infamously told an interviewer : ‘ i ’d rather smoke crack than eat cheese from a tin			1
’ in december she used @entity21 to recommend that for @entity112 , one should buy friends a £ 100 @entity115 scented candle and take a £ 65 set of @entity118 poker cards as a ‘ hostess gift			2
’ recipe : the £ 50 detox winter warmer that is free from gluten , sugar , caffeine , and any other additives hard at work : @entity1 and her team joined forces with a nutritionist to create some healthy recipes for her @entity21 fans to enjoy last @entity132 her post on ‘ spring wardrobe essentials ’ provoked ridicule when it emerged that they totalled £ 293,878 and included a silk skirt from @entity138 , costing £ 992 , and @entity140 trousers at £ 1,200 , in 2011 she released her cookbook ‘ @entity148 ’ which had frustrated readers searching the aisles of their local supermarkets for vegenaise , agave nectar and oven roasted kale crisps			1
but she has defended lifestyle advice saying she is the victim on mean - spirited critics saying : ‘ @entity151 of the problem is people get hit of energy when they are negative about something			0
‘ they do n’t understand why they do n’t have a happy life , i feel sorry for them			0
’ @entity1 became a household name in 1998 when her part in @entity162 won her the @entity163 for best actress			0
thanks to her burgeoning lifestyle empire she now limits herself to just one movie a year , for which she can command up to £ 15 million			0
and today she launched a january detox meal plan , which she promises is ' warming , filling and does n't feel like a sacrifice '			1
writing on her site @entity21 , she says : ' you know we love a good detox here at goop , and this january is no exception			1
what , no carbs ? plenty of herbal teas , salads , soups and oily fish feature on @entity1 's menu ' we created detox recipes that wo n't leave you feeling cold and hungry during the winter months , with guidance from dr. @entity187 , a specialist on the subject			1
' we took to the test kitchen to create a three - day menu of detox recipes that are warming and filling and do n't feel like a sacrifice			1
' we then turned to dr. @entity187 for some info on how to best detox during the cold winter months			0
dr. @entity187 contributed the warm shakes - the rest of the recipes are from the goop kitchen			0
' the menu advises detoxers to start the day with room temperature water and lemon , followed by a herbal tea and special shake			2
lunch consists of either a balsamic miso root salad or chickpea or carrot soup ( bread rolls not included , obviously )			0
if you 're feeling peckish in the afternoon , @entity1 suggests snacking on walnut lentil pate or a handful of nuts before feasting on coconut poached salmon , quinoa stuffed squash or pan-steamed chicken and broccoli for dinner			0
' adjust the times to your schedule and the meals to your taste , ' advises the actress			0
@entity228 words : @entity1 , who last year released a cookbook with her dietary tips , writes a weekly lifestyle blog foodies will be delighted to hear that this winter detox is much less strict than ones @entity1 and her team have created in the past			0
' our winter detox has looser guidelines and restrictions than ones we ’ve done in the past but ' , she adds , ' here is what we ’re avoiding : dairy , gluten , shellfish , anything processed ( including all soy products ) , nightshades ( potatoes , tomatoes , peppers and eggplant ) , condiments , sugar , alcohol , caffeine and soda , ' she writes			1
the mother - of - two is well - known for her strict health regime and even released her own cook book , it 's @entity262 , in 2012			2
according to the book 's synopsis , after a gruelling schedule and overindulgence in 2011 , @entity1 was left feeling fatigued and faint and a trip to the doctor later revealed that she was anaemic , vitamin d deficient , and that her stress levels were sky high			0
her doctor prescribed an elimination diet banning coffee , alcohol , sugar , eggs , wheat , meat and processed food to clear out her system and help her body heal			1
now we can all look like @entity1 : the detox eliminates dairy , gluten , shellfish , anything processed ( including all soy products ) , nightshades ( potatoes , tomatoes , peppers and eggplant ) , condiments , sugar , alcohol , caffeine and soda			1

recipe includes mint - flavoured liquid chlorophyl and spirulina powder
*41* - year - old teams up with nutritionist to unveil menu on her @entity21 site
promises it 's ' warming , filling and does n't feel like a sacrifice '
lots of herbal teas , salads , soups and fresh fish
coffee , alcohol , tomatoes , carbs , sugar and dairy all banned
