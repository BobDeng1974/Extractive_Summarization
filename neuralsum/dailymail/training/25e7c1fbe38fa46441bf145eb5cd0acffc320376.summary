@entity1 researchers have revealed the street of a lost medieval town dubbed ' @entity1 's @entity4 ' , for the first time			2
the team from the @entity7 used advanced 3d scanning to reveal the port town of @entity10			1
present day @entity10 is a village 14 miles south of @entity11 in @entity12 , but it was once a thriving port – similar in size to 14th century @entity14 until coastal erosion left it 10m underwater			1
extreme storms forced coastal erosion and flooding that have almost completely wiped out this once prosperous town over the past seven centuries			1
this process began in 1286 when a huge storm swept much of the settlement into the sea and silted up the @entity36			1
this storm was followed by a succession of others that silted up the harbour and squeezed the economic life out of the town , leading to its eventual demise as a major international port in the 15th century			1
it now lies collapsed and in ruins in a watery grave , three to 10 metres below the surface of the sea , just off the present coastline			2
funded and supported by @entity52 , the project led by professor @entity53 has produced the most accurate map to date of the town ’s streets , boundaries and major buildings , and revealed new ruins on the seabed			2
' visibility under the water at @entity10 is very poor due to the muddy water			2
' this has limited the exploration of the site			2
' we have now dived on the site using high resolution acoustic imaging to examine the ruins on the seabed – a first use of this technology for non-wreck marine archaeology			0
' the technology is rather like shining a torch onto the seabed , only using sound instead of light			0
' the data produced helps us to not only see the ruins , but also understand more about how they interact with the tidal currents and sea bed			0
' the project to survey the underwater ruins of @entity10 , the world ’s largest medieval underwater town site , began in 2008			1
six additional ruins on the seabed and 74 potential archaeological sites on the seafloor have since been found			0
combining all known archaeological data from the site , together with old charts and navigation guides to the coast , it has also led to the production of the most accurate and detailed map of the street layout and position of buildings , including the town ’s eight churches			0
bedrock structures spotted under the sea : the project to survey the underwater ruins of @entity10 , the world ¿ s largest medieval underwater town site , began in 2008 a @entity110 near @entity111 spotted 10m underwater by the researchers professor @entity53 said ' it is a sobering example of the relentless force of nature on our island coastline			1
it starkly demonstrates how rapidly the coast can change , even when protected by its inhabitants			0
' global climate change has made coastal erosion a topical issue in the @entity126 , but @entity10 demonstrates that it has happened before			1
' the severe storms of the 13th and 14th centuries coincided with a period of climate change , turning the warmer medieval climatic optimum into what we call the @entity134			1
the beach at @entity10 , there the ' old ' town disappears into the sea ' our coastlines have always been changing , and communities have struggled to live with this change			0
@entity10 reminds us that it is not only the big storms and their frequency – coming one after another , that drives erosion and flooding , but also the social and economic decisions communities make at the coast			1
' in the end , with the harbour silting up , the town partly destroyed , and falling market incomes , many people simply gave up on @entity10			0
' the underwater town : @entity10 map reconstruction showing coastline in 1250 and 2012 @entity161 , @entity52 ’s coastal survey expert who is currently completing a national assessment of coastal heritage assets in @entity164 , said : ' the loss of most of the medieval town of @entity10 over the last few hundred years – one of the most important @entity164 ports in the @entity169 – is part of a long process that is likely to result in more losses in the future			1
' everyone was surprised , though , by how much of the eroded town still survives under the sea and is identifiable			0
' whilst we can not stop the forces of nature , we can ensure what is significant is recorded and our knowledge and memory of a place does n’t get lost forever			0
' @entity184 and his team have developed techniques that will be valuable to understanding submerged and eroded terrestrial sites elsewhere			0

they include : identification of the limits of the town , which reveal it was a substantial urban centre occupying approximately 1.8 km2 – almost as large as the @entity230 confirmation the town had a central area enclosed by a defensive , possibly @entity235 earthwork , about 1km2 the documentation of ten buildings of medieval @entity10 , within this enclosed area , including the location and probable ruins of @entity194 , @entity241 ’s , all @entity242 ’s and @entity196 , and the @entity19 additional ruins which initial interpretation suggests are part of a large house , possibly the town hall further evidence that suggests the northern area of the town was largely commercial , with wooden structures associated with the port the use of shoreline change analysis to predict where the coastline was located at the height of the town ’s prosperity it now lies collapsed and in ruins in a watery grave , three to 10 metres below the surface of the sea , just off the present coastline			2
