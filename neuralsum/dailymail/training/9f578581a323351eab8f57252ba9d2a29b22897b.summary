@entity0 was left out in the cold yesterday as @entity3 leaders signed a controversial treaty which critics say could herald the dawn of a two - tier @entity7			1
@entity8 last night argued @entity0 would be pushed to the margins of @entity7 decision - making and renewed their calls for a referendum on whether we should now leave the @entity3			1
@entity15 chancellor @entity14 described the new fiscal compact – a desperate attempt to save the single currency – as a ‘ great leap ’ and a ‘ milestone ’ towards stability and political union			1
closer than ever : @entity24 president @entity23 , right , and @entity15 chancellor @entity14 yesterday under the treaty , eurozone countries will scrutinise each other ’s budgets and the @entity29 will be able to fine them if they fail to stick to the rules			1
but the new treaty ’s credibility was already under threat last night after both @entity34 and the @entity35 admitted they will miss targets for reducing their deficits			2
@entity0 and the @entity39 were the only two @entity3 countries who refused to sign the agreement during a 15 minute ceremony in @entity44 yesterday			1
bitter pill to swallow : but prime minister @entity46 insisted @entity0 's voice had been heard at the @entity3 the event was presided over by @entity49 , who had earlier been re-appointed unopposed as @entity7 president			1
@entity46 vetoed plans to change the @entity3 treaties to enforce greater budgetary discipline during a summit in december			1
@entity7 president @entity49 has been handed another two years in power without an election			2
mr @entity49 , 64 , who had no rivals for the post , received the backing of all @entity3 leaders including @entity46			1
the @entity62 politician will remain as @entity64 supremo until 2014			2
mr @entity49 was virtually unknown on the world stage when he was appointed as the council ’s first president in 2009			2
since then , he has presided over the @entity69 crisis			2
the @entity62 enjoys a £ 250,000 salary which is almost double that of mr @entity46			2
he triggered outrage on the eve of his second term this week by claiming national parliaments are now @entity3 institutions			1
he said : ‘ decisions by one national parliament – be it in @entity15 or @entity78 , in @entity79 or @entity80 – are watched all over @entity7			0
‘ maybe not formally speaking , but at least politically speaking , all national parliaments have become , in a way , @entity7 institutions			0
’ the @entity84 was drawn up to prevent the 17 eurozone states running up huge debts like those which sparked the @entity89 , @entity78 and @entity80 bailouts			1
but @entity92 mp @entity91 said : ‘ we now have two @entity94 , both built on sand			0
it is essential that we have a referendum in this country so that the people can have their say			0
‘ the whole treaty is a vain attempt to sacrifice practicality and democracy on the altar of ideology			0
‘ the new treaty is the triumph of expediency over the law			0
’ @entity92 mp @entity112 added : ‘ these @entity7 leaders have gone ahead with this arrangement despite @entity0 ’s veto and we are powerless to stop it			1
‘ @entity117 of all we were promised a referendum , then we were told there was a veto			0
the lesson we have learned from all of this is we can not trust the @entity3 mandarin elite			1
sixty million people in this country have been had			0
’ earlier , mrs @entity14 hailed the @entity126 as ‘ a milestone in the history of the @entity3 ’			1
she said : ‘ i think it ’s a strong signal that we have learned from the crisis and understood the signals and that we are banking on the future of a politically united @entity7			0
’ in a speech at the signing ceremony , @entity49 said : ‘ this stronger self - constraint by each and every one of you as regards debts and deficits is important in itself			1
‘ it helps prevent a repetition of the sovereign debt crisis			0
it will thus also reinforce trust among member states , which is politically important as well			0
’ speaking the same language : @entity24 president @entity23 , left , chats with @entity148 president @entity147 , center , and @entity15 chancellor @entity14 president of the @entity148 , @entity147 , said it was a strong political statement for the @entity3			1
‘ in the eyes of the world what is at stake is the very credibility of the euro area and of @entity7 as a whole , ’ he said			0
but the plight of debt - riddled @entity34 and the @entity35 cast a shadow over proceedings			0
@entity34 pm @entity163 said his country ’s budget deficit would be 5.8 per cent of gdp this year – about £ 12.5billion more than the 4.4 per cent agreed with @entity44			0
a minority of two : @entity46 and his @entity39 counterpart @entity168 , pictured outside @entity169 , were the only two @entity3 leaders not to sign up to the new fiscal pact designed to impose stronger financial discipline on the eurozone with the @entity35 – one of the few @entity178 - rated countries left in the eurozone – also struggling to hit budget targets , the credibility of the new deal was already under threat			1
the fiscal compact will now go before national parliaments and , in the case of the @entity185 , a referendum			2
to take effect , the pact must be ratified by 12 eurozone states			2
demands : prime minister @entity46 did eventually get his voice heard @entity46 yesterday claimed a minor victory after he forced @entity3 leaders to accept @entity0 plans to cut red tape and boost growth			1
the prime minister admitted he had been left ‘ frustrated ’ when his calls for deregulating some professional services and helping small businesseses were initially ignored			0
mr @entity46 , whose proposals were set out in a letter backed by 11 other countries , revealed he had been forced to ‘ bang the table ’ to get his ‘ voice heard ’			0
however @entity23 claimed the pm only drafted the letter to prevent @entity0 being ‘ left behind ’			1
he said : ‘ what a tribute this is to @entity7 , to send @entity7 such a lovely letter			0
‘ usually if you write a letter signed by other friends , you are either announcing that you are leaving or saying you love someone			0
‘ i take mr @entity46 ’s letter , after his decision not to join this latest treaty , as a sign that he does n’t want to get left behind			2

fiscal deal is designed to impose stronger financial discipline on the eurozone
