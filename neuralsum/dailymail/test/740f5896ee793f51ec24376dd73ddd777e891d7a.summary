@entity0 will no longer compete in the @entity1 as the @entity2 does not believe the competition suits the needs of its young players			1
@entity6 , sir @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 are all veterans of the long - contested under 16 tournament between the different associations within the @entity13			2
@entity0 are the most successful team in the history of the @entity1 , but it has been announced that they will not be fielding a side in the competition			2
the @entity2 have taken the decision to withdraw from future @entity1 tournaments wales are the current holders of the @entity1 while @entity0 are the most successful country 2010 - 11 : @entity0 2011 - 12 : @entity0 2012 - 13 : @entity0 2013 - 14 : @entity22 2014 - 15 : wales a statement from the @entity2 says the move ' ensures consistency with a key element of the @entity0 dna ' , with the move borne out of the desire to aid development by facing opposition from further afield			1
it is understood the decision has been sped up by @entity36 ' move to withdraw funding and propose an altered format , with @entity39 , the @entity2 's head of national teams at @entity41 , saying player development is the key reason			1
' we are reviewing our fixture programme at all ages and it is important that with @entity0 we are able to give players an international experience that compliments their club development and attempts to expose them to something different , ' he said			2
' at under 16 level we may only have the boys for between 10 to 15 matches per season			0
within that programme , it 's important to prioritise exposing them to @entity59 and world opposition			0
' we feel that within their club programmes , they face many of the boys that they would face in the @entity1 and so these fixtures , whilst competitive and exciting , do not expose our boys to different playing cultures			0
' although we recognise the historic interest in these matches , we are intent on maximising the football learning of our young players , while forming the programme of fixtures for the year around the crucial academic commitments our players face at this age group			0
' we also feel that due to the changes in format , uncertainty around the @entity1 and the potential changes suggested by @entity36 , it is a good time to review our fixtures and make an early decision so everyone can plan their 2015 - 16 fixtures with certainty			0
