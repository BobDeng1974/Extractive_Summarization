by @entity0 , business correspondent the taxman is demanding powers to seize money from couples ’ joint bank accounts – even if one partner owes nothing			1
@entity8 wants to be able to take money from any account – including isas and joint accounts – if it believes someone owes taxes			1
mps will today launch a withering attack on the controversial proposal , which they say could cause ‘ serious detriment ’ to ordinary taxpayers			0
under new powers being requested by @entity8 , the taxman would be able to seize cash from from joint accounts and @entity24 if they believed one of the account holders owed money the treasury select committee warns : ‘ this policy is highly dependent on @entity8 ’s ability to accurately determine which taxpayers owe money and what amounts they owe – an ability not always demonstrated in the past			1
incorrectly collecting money will result in serious detriment to taxpayers			0
’ under the proposal , @entity8 will be able to take all the money a person owes out of their bank account , building society account or @entity43 ‘ without the need to apply to a court ’			1
@entity8 insists it will not take the money unless the person has at least £ 5,000 left across all their bank accounts , including @entity24 , after the debt has been paid			1
it will not ‘ create or increase overdrafts ’			0
anybody who owes more than £ 1,000 could be affected and @entity8 expects to seize £ 375 million over the next four years			1
but experts warn that many couples are secretive about their finances , do not know what each other earns , and never discuss their finances or whether or not they have paid their tax bills			0
@entity60 , of the @entity61 , said : ‘ the problem is @entity8 ’s “ shoot first , ask questions later ” approach			2
’ @entity65 , head of taxation at the @entity67 , added : ‘ clearly , it needs a safeguard because otherwise it will hit people who have no idea that their husband or wife is a complete rogue			0
’ anyone who owes more than £ 1,000 could be affected as @entity8 expects to seize £ 375 ¿ million in four years innocent victims of the policy could include pensioners who put money into a joint account , managed by younger relatives			1
if their younger relative owes taxes , the money could be seized , even though it belongs to the elderly person			2
when the plans to raid accounts were published in the @entity89 , there was no mention of joint accounts			1
the proposal was first mooted in an @entity8 consultation document released this week			2
@entity94 , of the @entity95 , said the proposals – subject to a consultation which ends on july 29 – posed ‘ far too great a risk ’ to ordinary @entity99			0
he said : ‘ if strictly observed , the safeguards and conditions as set out should be broadly effective but if they are disregarded , vulnerable taxpayers will suffer – and that is far too great a risk			0
’ the consultation document said @entity8 expects 17,000 people a year will be hit by the new rules , known as the ‘ direct recovery of debts ’			2
typically , they will owe an average of £ 5,800 in tax			0
the document acknowledges the importance of ‘ striking a balance between recovering money from debtors while protecting the rights of other account holders ’			0
according to @entity8 ( pictured ) @entity99 is being robbed of £ 35billion a year by cheats not paying what they owe but it said its new powers must include joint accounts , or it would ‘ provide an obvious opportunity for debtors to circumvent paying what they owe ’			1
it suggests a ‘ pro-rata ’ system , whereby @entity8 could deduct 50 per cent of the credit balance of a joint account to pay a tax debt			1
but mr @entity60 said it was wrong to withdraw 50 per cent of the money from a joint account because many couples did not contribute money to a joint account on an equal basis			2
he added : ‘ for example , a woman might be putting in all the money while her husband is pursuing an unsuccessful business venture and has run up a tax debt			0
’ @entity146 , exchequer secretary to the treasury , said : ‘ it will help to level the playing field between those who pay what they owe when they owe it , and those who do not			0
’ @entity99 is being robbed of £ 35 billion a year by cheats who do n’t pay their taxes and others who find ways of avoiding paying them , according to @entity8			2
a spokesman said : ‘ we will be including joint accounts			1
if we did n’t , there would be an opportunity for debtors to get out of paying what they owe			0
