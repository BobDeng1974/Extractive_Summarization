by @entity0 published : 12:28 est , 12 december 2012 updated : 16:41 est , 12 december 2012 most of us have seen the arresting tv ad starring hard man @entity4 illustrating how best to resuscitate a cardiac arrest victim			2
the advert shows him foregoing mouth - to - mouth , instead to explaining how apply chest compressions			0
the idea is that mouth - to - mouth is often ineffective if performed by an untrained member of the public			0
it also gets in the way of the crucial chest compression ’s need to keep the victim ’s heart beating			0
now , @entity21 researchers say chest compressions alone really do save more lives - and can reduce the risk of brain damage			1
the latest findings suggest hands - only @entity37 is more effective than traditional cpr in emergency situations , adding that not only is hands - only cpr easier to learn , it is more comfortable to perform on a stranger			1
dr @entity44 , a senior lecturer in the department of preventive services at @entity47 , said : ' we would like to suggest that compression - only cpr should be the standard and conventional cpr with rescue breathing the option			0
' the latest findings will be welcome news to those who are put off by performing mouth - to - mouth breathing or can not perform chest compressions and rescue breathing at the same time			2
cardio - pulmonary resuscitation ( @entity37 ) , as it is officially known , is given to patients who have suffered a cardiac arrest the study examined 1,376 patients who suffered sudden cardiac arrest between 2005 and 2009			1
in each of the cases , bystanders had witnessed the cardiac arrest and provided cpr and shocks from an automatic defibrillator to the patient			0
researchers said that about 37 per cent of the patients received hands - over cpr and 63 percent received traditional cpr			1
the study found that about a month after their cardiac arrest , about 46 per cent of patients who received only chest compressions were still alive , compared to about 40 per cent of those who received traditional cpr			1
researchers also found that more than 40 per cent of people who received chest compressions alone retained good brain function , compared with 33 per cent who received compressions and rescue breathing			1
according to the @entity87 , people should perform hands - over cpr by pushing hard and fast in the center of the chest if they see an adult suddenly collapse			2
however , infants and children should receive traditional cpr that includes mouth - to - mouth resuscitation			0
