a group of @entity2 light designers in @entity3 are about to take an apartment tower and transform it into a beautiful canvas that can tell you more about the weather than looking up at the sky			1
thirty - five ' fins ' run up and down the 40 - story structure that hold 250,000 diffused led 's			0
@entity12 , creative director of the project , said every half hour the building will communicate the next day 's weather forecast , while during the remaining time it will be like a ' light house ' communicating the ' feel ' of the weather through light			1
after spending eight years living in @entity3 mr @entity12 said he noticed @entity30 had a peculiar obsession with the weather and thought it could be possible to ' bring light to a community ' in a way that articulates what it actually feels like to be there			1
during the day it will appear to be a normal building but as the sun goes down and the city is plunged into darkness , you will really see the effects of the lights			2
' there 's a lot of movement available to this lighting system so if it ever gets windy down in the @entity52 , the lights will move directionally with the wind			1
every half hour , tomorrows weather forecast will wrap around the building ' the movement isnt physical but the way we can program the lights means there will be a sense of gentle but apparent movement , ' he said			1
he explained that by experimenting with the lights programming he can take a cool blue and introduce a shadow that can make it appear as if the building is moving , as rain would			2
the light show will be based off weather data sent through by the @entity70			0
do n't expect the building to look like the weather forecast app on your phone though as mr @entity12 wants the building to echo more than the temperature			1
' it 's not necessarily about what the light does but how it makes you feel			1
' ' we really want to explore how a cool change feels , or the breaking sun feels , ' he added			0
visionary : mr @entity12 wants architecture to reflect nature and humanity instead of the static concrete jungle we see today mr @entity12 said light is a language everyone can understand because we do n't understand it through our brains , but instead feel and understand it through our bodies			1
' when you see a blue light , you might not be able to describe it but you get how it feels			0
light is a language we do n't have to think about , ' he added			0
mr @entity12 said he wanted to bring a feeling of movement that 's engaging so buildings can start to relate to people and reflect humanity			2
' you get it out there in nature all the time			0
there are subtle movements in trees or the ocean			0
then when we go to cities , it is just static chunks of concrete and glass			0
i would prefer they reflect us and the natural elements we are from			0
' the @entity127 building is expected to be completed in early 2017 however mr @entity12 said , if all goes to plan , the lights should be up and running next year .			2

a @entity3 building will light up to reflect the current weather
it will also deliver a half hourly weather forecast using the lights
the lights can move directionally to represent rain or wind
designer @entity12 wants the building to reflect nature and humanity
' it 's not necessarily about what the light does but how it makes you feel '
