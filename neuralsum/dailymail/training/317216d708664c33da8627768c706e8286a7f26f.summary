by @entity0 published : 07:40 est , 14 april 2012 updated : 02:13 est , 15 april 2012 a proposed airport in the @entity2 would be in the ' very worst spot ' for the south - east 's crowded airspace , according to the boss of @entity7 's air traffic control service			1
@entity8 , chief executive of the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) , said there were ' serious challenges ' in working more planes into an already busy flight path			1
he added that the architects who unveiled plans for the £ 50bn project last november had not even asked air traffic control about the feasibility of the airport			1
' the very worst spot ' : an artist 's impression of how the ' @entity24 ' airport in the @entity2 could look the stinging attack on plans for the ' floating ' airport from @entity7 's most senior air traffic chief will add to growing calls it to be scrapped			1
@entity8 said that the @entity34 estuary airport - dubbed the ' @entity24 ' after @entity33 mayor @entity32 - would be built under flight paths for four of @entity33 's five airports			1
these include @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			2
' we 're a little surprised that none of the architects thought it worthwhile to have a little chat , ' mr @entity8 told the @entity47			1
the plans by architects @entity50 were revealed in january and would make the airport the biggest in @entity7			2
busy : the four - runway airport in the @entity34 would be capable of handling 150 million passengers a year , but there are concerns about airspace congestion mr @entity8 said that the majority of flight paths criss - crossed the direct spot where the estuary airport is planned			1
this would lead to more traffic jams in the air			2
planes arriving and departing airports must follow strict flight paths			2
if the skies are congested the planes must circle before there is a slot in the sky			1
he added that in addition to the risk of planes being hit by birds in the wetands , there would also be competition for air space from @entity81 's @entity81			2
more flights would then be forced to circle overhead for longer			1
mr @entity8 said that even though the estuary airport was possible it would go against plans in the aviation industry to conserve fuel by shortening flight times			1
he called for a third runway to be built at @entity38			2
' the single biggest thing we could do to reduce co2 in the @entity7 is to build a third runway at @entity38 , ' he said			2
' @entity38 holding is not about airspace - it 's about lack of tarmac			2
i 'm very confident that ( a third runway ) would eliminate all the holding patterns in one go			0
' vital : @entity104 has reportedly claimed that expansion of @entity38 , pictured , is key to @entity7 's economic future controversial : the plans for a third runway have been met with constant strong opposition from local residents near the proposed site the @entity113 agreement signed between the conservatives and @entity115 in 2010 banned any extra airports			1
however , there is growing pressure from @entity119 , the flight industry and from @entity121 ministers for @entity7 to increase its air capacity			0
@entity123 has even signalled his intention to increase the number of flights coming in and out of the @entity7 either by expanding @entity38 or building anew airport			1
one of the most likely options is the ' @entity24 '			1
the government aviation review is currently looking at the project after @entity104 announced in the @entity132 that @entity7 needed to ‘ confront the lack of airport capacity ’ in the @entity135 of @entity136			0
the £ 50billion airport would be built on an artificial island made of landfill and would be capable of handling 150 million passengers annually - or 300,000 passengers a day - making it @entity7 ’s main international hub			0
having initalliy ruled out a third runway at @entity38 after opposition from locals and environmental groups , the government is ‘ increasingly interested ’ in the idea			0
the scheme is expected to cost between £ 40billion and £ 70billion			0
the airport would have four runways , with space to build two more			0
mayor of london @entity32 , left , is keen on plans for an airport in the @entity2			0
chancellor @entity104 has signalled a u-turn on a controversial third runway at @entity38 mr @entity32 has also praised separate designs by architect @entity158 for a £ 50billion airport on a sparse strip of land on the @entity162 in @entity163 , which juts out into the estuary			0
@entity33 mayoral candidate @entity165 today slammed mr @entity32 's ' fantasy island ' and called for a third runway at @entity38			1
she said : ' by blocking the runway , @entity32 is preventing the creation of tens of thousands of jobs in @entity33 and depriving our economy of billions of pounds			1
surely this government ’s u-turn on @entity38 has left @entity32 stranded on his fantasy island			0
' ' by the time a new airport is built , @entity33 will have lost out to another @entity178 city , like @entity179 , @entity180 or @entity181 and that would sound the death knell to @entity38			1
that would be a devastating blow to jobs and the economy			0
' environmental campaigners have criticised the plans for the damage they could do to rare wildlife in the estuary , as well as adding to @entity7 's co2 emissions			0
the government has meanwhile signalled that plans for a controversial third runway at @entity38 are ' back on the table '			0
the chancellor has refused to rule out expanding @entity7 's biggest airport because he believes it is key to our ' hub status ' and essential to @entity7 's economic future			0
earlier this month a report suggested that the @entity7 economy will suffer by up to £ 8.5billion per year over the next decade if @entity38 does not undergo significant expansion			0
a @entity208 spokesman said : ' in the summer we will consult on an overarching sustainable framework for @entity7 aviation and alongside this we will publish a call for evidence on maintaining effective @entity7 hub airport connectivity			0
the coalition 's position regarding @entity38 has not changed			0

@entity9 chief executive @entity8 says there are ' serious challenges ' with @entity24 site
the majority of @entity33 flights cross planned sight and will cause congestion in the skies , he says
