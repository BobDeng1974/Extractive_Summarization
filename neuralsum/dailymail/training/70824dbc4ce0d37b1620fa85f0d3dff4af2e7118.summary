by @entity0 one artist created an intricate model of a fast food restaurant entirely out of wood @entity5 created the piece ' @entity7 ' , an installation comprised of two large scale dioramas at the @entity11 gallery in @entity12			1
this is part of ' apparatus ' , @entity5 's first solo show in @entity12			2
@entity5 's replica leaves no detail behind and is equipped with a deep fryer and a soft serve ice - cream machine			2
what 's missing however , are big logos and any semblance of food			0
the other diorama is meant to resemble a control room with an unknown function , reports thisiscolassal.com			0
the models are made of birch , maple , glass , and are accented by fluorescent lighting			1
' @entity5 transforms the environments on display by using the diorama â€™s traditional experience as a tool to create a contemplative experience where what we see behind the glass transitions between being real and being a mere shell of something real , ' says the gallery 's website			0
the gallery 's website explains that in the @entity46 language diorama quite literally translates to , ' through that which is seen			0
' ' @entity5 introduces a new chapter in his work , a series of large scale dioramas			1
inspired by spaces and environments designed to be activated via human interaction , a fast - food restaurant and a control room , the dioramas present spaces and objects which are hand carved from birch and maple wood and formed from steel , encased and frozen in time , void of human presence , making their inherent function obsolete , ' explains the website			1
the spaces the artist creates are reliant on the viewer 's ' human interaction ' to give them a function and are otherwise devoid of meaning			0

artist @entity5 designed two large scale wooden models : one of a fast food kitchen and one of a control room
diorama quite literally means ' that which is seen ' and the art in @entity5 's installation relies on the viewer in order for the *structures* to have meaning
the models are made of birch , maple , glass , and are accented by fluorescent lighting
