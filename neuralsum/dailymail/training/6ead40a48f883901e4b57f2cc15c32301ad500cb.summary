women who drink throughout pregnancy will not be criminalised after a landmark ruling today women who drink alcohol while pregnant will not be criminalised after a landmark ruling today			2
it comes after a test case held at the @entity8 ruled that a young child is not entitled to criminal injuries compensation after her mother drank half a bottle of vodka and eight cans of lager a day while she was pregnant with her			1
the girl , now six , was born with foetal alcohol syndrome and suffered growth retardation as a result of her mother 's drinking			1
lawyers for child ' @entity23 ' , who can not be named for legal reasons , had asked three judges to rule in a test case that the girl is entitled to compensation			1
but the appeal judges unanimously ruled : ' the central reason is that we have held that a mother who is pregnant and who drinks to excess despite knowledge of the potential harmful consequence to the child of doing so is not guilty of a criminal offence under our law if her child is subsequently born damaged as a result			1
' if the appeal had succeeded it could have paved the way for pregnant women 's behaviour to be criminalised , according to the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) and @entity50			1
lawyers for the child say that view was ' misplaced speculation '			2
@entity55 , chief executive of the @entity49 , and @entity57 , co-chair of @entity50 , welcomed the court 's unanimous decision , saying : ' this is an extremely important ruling for women everywhere			2
' the @entity63 's highest courts have recognised that women must be able to make their own decisions about their pregnancies			2
' the appeal judges heard that a large number of similar claims for compensation by children allegedly harmed by alcohol in the womb were awaiting the outcome of @entity23 's appeal , with solicitors already instructed in around 80 cases			1
@entity77 , the @entity78 , sitting with @entity79 and @entity80 , considered the case recently at a one - day hearing			2
the judges were told that the mother was drinking ' an enormous amount ' while pregnant with @entity23 , including a half - bottle of vodka and eight cans of strong lager a day , and the child was born with an alcohol - related disease			1
it comes after a test case held at the @entity8 ruled that a young child is not entitled to criminal injuries compensation after her mother drank half a bottle of vodka and eight cans of lager a day while she was pregnant with her ( posed by model ) @entity100 , appearing for @entity23 , said that was the equivalent of 40 - 57 units of alcohol a day			1
guidelines issued by the @entity105 ( @entity105 ) were that 7.5 units might damage a foetus			2
mr @entity108 was representing a council in the @entity110 which now has responsibility for @entity23 and was seeking an award on her behalf under the @entity114			0
he said the mother ' was aware of the dangers to her baby of her excessive consumption during pregnancy '			2
he added : ' she was reckless as to whether there would be harm to the foetus			1
she foresaw that harm might be caused but went on to take the risk			2
' @entity23 was born in june 2007 with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder ( @entity126 ) , also referred to as foetal alcohol syndrome ( @entity128 )			0
it can cause retarded growth , facial abnormalities and intellectual impairment			0
her compensation claim was based on the assertion that her mother had committed an offence against her as defined under the @entity137 by drinking excessively during pregnancy			1
@entity139 , appearing for the @entity114 ( @entity114 ) , asked the court to reject @entity23 's legal challenge			0
he told the judges : ' there is a conflict of ideas about what is or is not dangerous , not only in terms of drink but also in terms of smoking and food			0
' if the appeal at the @entity8 had succeeded it could have paved the way for pregnant women 's behaviour to be criminalised , according to the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) and @entity50 mr @entity139 asked whether ' a pregnant mother who eats unpasteurised cheese or a soft boiled egg knowing there is a risk that it could give rise to a risk of harm to the foetus ' might also find herself accused of a crime			1
@entity126 was diagnosed 252 times in @entity168 in 2012 to 2013			0
@entity23 's compensation application was initially rejected by the @entity114 in november 2009 on the grounds that she had not sustained an injury ' directly attributable to a crime of violence ' , as required by the @entity137			1
a first - tier tribunal allowed her initial appeal but the @entity178 of the @entity179 ruled last december that the law required a crime to be committed against an individual ' person ' - and a child did not become a person until birth			1
the @entity178 concluded : ' if ( the girl ) was not a person while her mother was engaging in the relevant actions then , as a matter of law , her mother could not have committed a criminal offence			1
' asking the appeal judges to quash the @entity178 decision , mr @entity108 argued @entity23 had been a person entitled to compensation while still a foetus and the crime committed against had similar ingredients to manslaughter			1
alternatively , she became entitled to an award when she was born and was suffering the continuing consequences of her alcoholic mother 's drinking			1
mr @entity108 said @entity23 was the young mother 's second pregnancy and the woman was well aware of the risks			1
but she had recklessly ' administered a noxious thing - a destructive thing ' to her unborn daughter and inflicted grievous bodily harm for which the child should be compensated			1
dismissing @entity23 's appeal , @entity79 said an ' essential ingredient ' for a crime to be committed ' is the infliction of grievous bodily harm on a person - grievous bodily harm on a foetus will not suffice '			1
a mother who admitted drinking two bottles of wine a day while pregnant has said she believes she has permanently damaged one of her two children			1
the woman - who spoke to @entity230 named only as @entity231 - said she feels guilt over her excessive drinking , but said she was an alcoholic and lost ' the power of choice '			1
she told the interview that she came from a happy , stable family but started drinking every night after finishing university			0
every night soon became every lunchtime too and she eventually lost her high - profile job			0
but she said when she discovered she was pregnant at the age of 30 , she was delighted			0
' i knew 100 per cent i would not drink if i was pregnant , because i could n't do that to a child			2
' but because i am an alcoholic i do n't have that choice , i lost that power of choice , and after a month i relapsed and i started drinking			0
' @entity231 said she was drinking as much as two bottles of wine a day but played down just how much she was consuming throughout her first pregnancy			0
despite this her first child was healthy and was monitored by doctors for two years after he was born , and did not appear to have suffered any long term damage			2
but during her second pregnancy , @entity231 said she relapsed after the first trimester and started to drink ' a hell of a lot ' now she fears her son , who is seven is siffering the long term effects			0
she said : ' it is behavioural , poor concentration , bad language , poor social behaviour , poor eye contact			0
' i chose not to tell the doctors about my drinking because of the stugma of it , and he was diagnosed as being on autistic spectrum			0
' i really struggled with it , and felt guilty , thinking it was me who had done it to him			0
but i was ill at the time , i lost that choice			0
all i can do now is be a sober mum to him			0
' @entity126 is an umbrella term describing disabilities and behavioural problems suffered by children as a result of their mother 's drinking while pregnant			1
there are no reliable figures for how many children and adults in the @entity63 have it			0
but some experts say one in every 250 babies is born with it – more than 3,000 in this country a year			0
children tend to suffer behavioural problems such as hyperactivity , learning difficulties and epilepsy			0
they also often have distinct physical features including a flat face , snub nose and widely spaced eyes			0
the severity of the problem usually depends on how much their mother drank – but it will remain with them for the rest of their lives			2
the disorder is caused by alcohol flowing through the placenta into the foetus and damaging cells in the brain and spinal cord			0
some studies have found that the alcohol causes most harm during the early stages of pregnancy when these organs are developing			0
the @entity328 advises women not to drink any alcohol during pregnancy but , if they must , to limit themselves to one to two units once or twice a week , and never get drunk			0
but figures show that only half of all pregnant women give up alcohol completely during pregnancy and most do not cause their babies any harm			2
some experts say the condition is triggered by a complex range of factors including genes , a mother 's age and her diet – as well as alcohol .			1

woman , then 17 , drank vodka and beer while pregnant with second child
girl , now six , was born disabled as a result of her mother 's drinking
@entity8 said it was ' not a criminal offence ' that she drank to excess
judges said the ' essential ingredient ' for a crime to be committed is the infliction of grievous bodily harm on a person - not harm on a foetus
