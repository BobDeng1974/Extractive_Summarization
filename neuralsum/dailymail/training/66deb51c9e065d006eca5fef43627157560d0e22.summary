it was granted put to death : @entity50 - born @entity30 @entity49 , 52 , left , and @entity28 @entity47 , 53 , right , were executed by firing squads in @entity2 after last - ditch diplomatic efforts for clemency failed @entity90 said the executions , the first under the new president who took office in november , were ' a retrograde step ' for human rights			1
but @entity2 's attorney general , @entity97 , has said there is no excuse for drug dealers and ' hopefully , this will have a deterrent effect			2
' mr @entity97 said the new government had a firm commitment to fight against drugs			0

no mercy : president @entity40 has said he would not grant clemency to 64 drug convicts on death row ' @entity2 's new government took office on the back of promises to improve respect for human rights , but carrying out these executions would be a regressive move , ' he said			1
' rather than putting to death more people , the government should immediately impose a moratorium on the use of the death penalty with a view to its eventual abolition ' @entity90 noted that drug - related offences do not meet the threshold of the ' most serious crimes ' for which the death penalty can be imposed under international law			2
while no executions were carried out in @entity2 in 2014 , the government has announced that 20 are scheduled for this year , the campaign group said			1
mr @entity150 said : ' it would be a huge set back if the government goes ahead with its plans to execute as many as 20 people during the year			0
tackling rising crime rates is a legitimate goal of president @entity40 's administration , but the death penalty is not the answer and does not work as a deterrent to crime			0
' the plans for a new spate of executions come at a time when the government is actively seeking to protect @entity2 nationals who face the death penalty overseas			1
