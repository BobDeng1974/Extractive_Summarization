an artist made a papier - mâché sculpture from comics only to discover that the books were in fact first editions worth about £ 20,000			1
the piece of artwork , called @entity8 , was created by @entity9 , 49 , from @entity10 , who found the comics for the man - sized statue in a skip			1
however , after handing the sculpture over to an exhibition he was told the comics , which included a first edition of @entity19 , would have been worth a small fortune			2
oops : @entity9 pictured with his sculpture called @entity8 which he created using £ 20,000 of comics comic book expert , @entity25 , 52 , made the jaw - dropping discovery when he looked at the piece and it began to dawn on him that the pages pasted to the leg of @entity8 were from the classic comic book published by @entity31			1
mr @entity25 , who also has a first edition of @entity19 which is worth around £ 10,000 , said it would have been cheaper for the jobbing artist to have sculpted it out of @entity37 marble			1
he said : ' as i walked round it , on the inside right leg , there was a cover of @entity19 number one			0
' i actually did a double take when i saw it			0
blunder : artist @entity9 stands with @entity25 who is holding his first edition copy of @entity19 and realised the sculpture had been made from valuable comics @entity49 : the sculpture which @entity9 created unwittingly with £ 20,000 of comics ' i ’ve got a copy of that , which was published in 1963 , and it is worth well over £ 10,000			1
' then i started looking and there are six other comics on the sculpture that added with the number one would be worth £ 20,000			0
' mr @entity9 explained how he came across the valuable books			2
he said : ' i saw the box in a skip and thought you ca n’t throw those away			0
' if somebody chucks things out in the skip they do n’t generally throw things out that are worth anything			2
' i did n’t know what i was going to do with them			0
i just thought they were lovely things			0
' i had them for ages until i heard about the exhibition and decided to make a sculpture			0
collector 's item : pictured is comic book expert @entity25 's copy of @entity19 worth £ 10,000 oh dear : the copy of @entity19 on the right side of the sculpture 's leg @entity25 said it would have been cheaper for @entity9 to make the sculpture out of @entity37 marble ' @entity25 said ' wow this is good ' and then started walking around saying ' where did you get this one from , where did you get that one from ? ' he could n’t believe it but i think there is no point crying over spilt milk			1
' mr @entity25 said he could n’t sleep that night after realising how much the comic books were worth			1
' nothing can be done now but i ’m looking to get @entity100 to buy the sculpture , or maybe @entity103 , they both like comics			0
' in the end i ’ll probably never sell it but it ’ll be a great talking point			0
' mr @entity25 said he could n’t sleep that night after realising how much the comics were worth mr @entity25 , who runs @entity10 - based comic business @entity109 , added : ' i lost sleep thinking about the sculpture and he built it up from lots of different layers so i dread to think what is underneath			1
' it would have been cheaper for @entity9 to make this out of @entity37 marble because the raw materials that have gone in to it , i could have sold for a lot more than he is going to sell this statue for			1
' in the end , it is a beautiful thing but @entity9 is a talented jobbing artist who has n’t had his break yet and £ 20,000 is a lot of money to him			2
' i told him later i had loads of comics i could have given him for 10p if he needed them and to call me first if he finds anything else in a skip			0
