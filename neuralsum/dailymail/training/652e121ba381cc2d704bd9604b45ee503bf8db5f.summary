@entity0 looked fresh enough to go out and do it all again			1
this is how it must feel to be high on the euphoria of an unstoppable rise to the top of the world			0
it had just gone midnight in the concrete underbelly of the @entity10 and his eyes sparkled as @entity0 tried to explain the emotion of scoring the goal @entity15 have waited 12 years to score			1
‘ when you ’re a little boy you dream of lifting the @entity23 trophy and to lift the 10th one for @entity15 is special , ’ said @entity0 , pausing en route to the carefully choreographed celebrations waiting in the @entity19 capital			1
seeing all the fans and all the players run over , it was amazing			0
it ’s the reason i joined @entity15 to play in competitions like this and be able to win them			2
for me it ’s a dream come true			0
’ the £ 86m man became the first @entity50 to score in the @entity23 final and the 20th @entity52			1
for the record , the other 19 are : @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 ( 2 ) , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 ( 2 ) , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72			1
so many expensive footballers have pulled on the pristine white shirt without being able to achieve what @entity0 , the most expensive of them all , has done in his first season in @entity19			1
@entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 have all come and gone , unable to deliver what @entity0 delivered			1
goalden boy : @entity69 famously scored for @entity87 in @entity88 in 2005 heading for goal : despite being defenders , @entity60 ( left ) and @entity70 both scored in finals dream @entity92 : @entity59 ( left ) and fellow @entity93 @entity68 both notched worth every penny : @entity63 , @entity95 's first £ 1m player , celebrates after scoring for @entity96 in 1979 with his status assured as a goal hero of @entity100 in a final against city rivals @entity101 , his life will never be the same			1
no - one will quibble with the £ 86million world - record transfer fee again			2
not for the first time in the last 12 months , he must wonder where this breakneck journey is going to take him			2
from @entity106 to the @entity107 , the winner in the @entity110 final and now the pivotal strike in the @entity23 final			2
what better way to celebrate all this than with a showpiece at the @entity116 where @entity15 will face @entity117 in the @entity118 on august 12 , a week before @entity119 set out on yet another @entity121 campaign			0
it promises to be an emotional homecoming for the @entity50 , who could captain his country for the first time in a friendly against @entity128 in @entity129 next week			1
united they stand : @entity56 , @entity58 ( below left ) and @entity57 ( below right ) all scored in 1968 bringing it up to date : @entity72 ( left ) scored in 2011 and @entity71 bagged a goal in 2008 @entity135 and @entity136 were numb with a heady mix of shock and pride as they climbed aboard an early - morning flight in @entity142 sunday			1
they had spoken to their son on the phone but did not have time to see him			0
@entity0 was being whisked through his media responsibilities before flying back to @entity15 with his team - mates			1
by 4am yesterday morning , he was sharing photos of the victory party with his three million followers on @entity152			0
on his way out of the stadium , he seemed bashful , reluctant to talk too much about the most amazing night of his professional life			0
many team - mates left wearing their white @entity15 match shirts or specially printed ‘ @entity100 ’ t - shirts			0
@entity0 was slick in his black club suit and skinny tie , toilet bag tucked under an arm and the silver gong dangling from his neck on a blue ribbon			2
@entity166 : @entity62 scored the winner for @entity87 in the 1978 @entity23 final spot on : penalty king @entity61 ( left ) scored for @entity87 in 1977 and 1984 , while his fellow full back @entity65 hit the winner in the 1980 final @entity173 maulers : @entity67 ( left ) scored an added - time equaliser against @entity175 in 1999 and 17 years earlier @entity66 scored the only @entity177 goal which beat @entity175 @entity178 : @entity54 ( left ) and @entity55 both scored in the 1967 win against @entity180 he had the medal , he had his hands on the trophy every footballer wants and he had made such a vital contribution , once @entity186 had saved @entity15 from heartbreak with the stoppage - time header that took the game into extra time			1
without @entity186 , this would have been a tale of woe for @entity0 ; emptiness after a promising first campaign in @entity19 , cast as a villain , having snatched at two glorious chances , one in each half of normal time , and missed them both			1
he had not played well			0
‘ a few thoughts crept into my mind , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ we have been like that all season			0
we ’ve been down in the last minute and always been able to come up with a crucial goal and we showed it again			0
we kept believing in the football we play and we came out on top			0
’ the concept of extra time might have been designed for @entity0 and @entity209 to showcase their phenomenal reserves of stamina and pace against wilting opponents			1
ups and downs : @entity0 missed a number of good chances before eventually getting on the scoresheet @entity101 were grinding to a standstill with players barely able to run , hobbling and limping			1
dotted around the pitch were red - and - white shirted shapes stretching muscles as calves and hamstrings cramped			0
then came @entity0 ’s moment ; an hour and 50 minutes into a gripping final			2
it typified his boundless energy and desire as he followed in @entity233 ’s run and shot as it spun high from the left boot of goalkeeper @entity236			0
despite those earlier misses , he refused to hide			0
‘ you have to keep persisting , ’ said @entity0 , but few would have noticed had he been jogging up the pitch rather than sprinting from half - way in anticipation			1
this was the hard part , to be where he was at that stage of the game			0
‘ he turned up when he was needed , ’ said manager @entity248 , who boldly predicts the @entity250 international , without a @entity251 summer , will be an even greater force next season			0
persistent : @entity0 refused to hide despite those earlier misses the finish was relatively simple : a big spring and a cushion header from a yard or so			2
‘ do n’t miss , ’ smiled @entity0 , when asked later what had flashed through his mind at that precise moment			2
this was far removed from @entity0 ’s exhilarating solo goal to win the @entity110 against @entity263 last month and yet so much more precious to a club obsessed with this 10th @entity266 title			1
it destroyed @entity101 to such an extent that they collapsed and conceded two more , scored by @entity270 and @entity271			2
it was to all intents and purposes the killer strike — the winner — although everyone in the @entity15 camp seemed mightily relieved when @entity271 engineered and then converted a penalty and spared them all the inevitable sulk			0
room to improve : @entity248 said the @entity50 can be even better next season ‘ he obviously got on the score - sheet and that was important for us , ’ said @entity0 , diplomatically			1
after all , the stage had been set for @entity271 ’s night in @entity142			0
his penalty was his 17th goal in @entity23 campaign , a record			1
his personal numbers are staggering but not even the self - important shirtless and muscle - flexing celebration of the fourth goal could distract from the fact this triumph was about more than one man			1
the perfect 10th was also about @entity300 and @entity186 and @entity233 and @entity270			0
it was about @entity248 and it was about @entity0			2
nine months after leaving @entity119 he could not have dared to hope for more .			0

@entity0 said he dreamed of lifting the @entity23 when he was a boy
follows likes of fellow brits @entity58 , @entity62 , @entity69 and @entity72 in scoring in @entity23 finals
his goal was the vital one in the 4 - 1 win over @entity101
the £ 86m man has truly delivered in his first season in @entity19 - no one will be able to doubt his price tag now
@entity50 could captain his country for the first time next week
