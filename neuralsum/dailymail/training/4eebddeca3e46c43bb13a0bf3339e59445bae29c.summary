furthermore , @entity44 had also been witnessed beforehand performing a dangerous contortionist trick which allowed him to put his handcuffed hands under his body to the front			0
this is called ' fronting ' and would allow him far more mobility as he resisted			0
' in the video , officer @entity12 first reaches for his taser , ' said the official investigation from @entity67			0
deadly : officer @entity12 shoots @entity44 as his hand is knocked by the guard ' however , he decides not to deploy his taser because he knew that mr. @entity7 — also earlier that same day — had undergone five cycles of the @entity77 device , without effect			1
' he had been tased earlier in the day after he assaulted a police officer and other people at the hospital where he was being evaluated			0
' according to @entity67 officer @entity12 drew his handgun and not his taser because he knew that ' @entity44 could quickly front his cuffs and turn them into a deadly weapon , given his considerable strength , agility and demonstrated resistance to the @entity77 ... ' at the same moment officer @entity12 draws his weapon , mr. @entity7 pushes off on that curb and , with remarkable strength , sends the civilian escort flying backwards			2
' the civilian escort 's arm then hits the trigger hand of officer @entity12 , causing his weapon to discharge			0

however , @entity12 is currently on leave			0
