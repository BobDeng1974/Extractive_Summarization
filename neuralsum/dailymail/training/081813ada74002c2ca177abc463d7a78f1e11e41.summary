by @entity1 reporter the exact science behind how our @entity3 began has baffled astronomers for centuries			0
but the discovery of a ' baby @entity3 ' galaxy called @entity10 could provide us with the clues we need to reveal the secrets of our own creation			1
@entity14 at @entity16 astronomer dr @entity15 used the most powerful telescope on @entity18 to make the discovery that could rewrite the laws of galaxy formation			1
the galaxy dla2222 - 0946 , a young version of our @entity3 , was detected by observing its hydrogen emission as shown in this image of a chunk of the galaxy 16,300 light years across the movement of the gas in the galaxy ( red is towards us , blue is away ) indicates it is in the early stages of forming a spiral galaxy like the @entity3 , which could reveal how our own galaxy formed the young galaxy was found 10.8 billion light years from @entity18 using a quasar , a super-heated region of gas and dust around a supermassive black hole , as a reference			1
the discovery was made using the @entity43 on @entity44 , @entity45 , one of the most advanced and powerful telescopes in the world			1
thousands of so - called ' damped @entity49 ' ( @entity50 ) have been found to date , which are galaxies discovered by detecting their influence on nearby objects like quasars			0
but @entity56 is the first to be discovered that so closely resembles the same formation process our @entity3 went through several billion years ago , termed a ' baby @entity3 ' by dr @entity15			1
' it 's sort of extraordinary for being ordinary , ' said dr @entity15 , speaking in @entity61 at an @entity63 meeting			2
how did the @entity3 begin ? observations of galaxies that will ultimately form the same shape as our own could give us the vital clues we need to explain how stars were created in our galaxy discoveries of this sort are all the more impressive for their difficulty			2
dr @entity15 likened finding @entity74 - 0946 as ' akin to reading the president 's newspaper in the @entity77 ' from six miles away			1
she added finding such a galaxy in this stage of its formation ' is something astronomers have been trying to do for over thirty years			0
' the discovery was made using the @entity43 on @entity44 in @entity45 , one of the biggest and most powerful telescopes in the world the galaxy is so far away that what we are observing now corresponds to a time when the universe was only 20 percent of its current age			1
determining how galaxies like this turn their gas and dust into stars is one of the biggest mysteries in the cosmos			0
continued studies of @entity10 could ultimately reveal this missing piece in the story of the @entity3 's formation			2
@entity106 scientists have found evidence that the @entity3 was formed from the inside out			0
using data from the @entity112 - @entity111 project , scientists were able to back up predicted divisions in the chemical make - up of stars			0
their research reveals how stars in centre of the @entity3 ‘ live fast and die young ’ , shedding light on the formation of disk galaxies			2
the scientists analysed the levels of magnesium - which is present in older stars - to determine their age			0
using the eight metre @entity126 in @entity127 , they discovered the inner regions of the @entity3 were the first to form , explaining its ' flying saucer ' shape .			0

@entity14 astronomer has obtained the first image of a young galaxy similar to our own @entity3 in the process of formation
dr @entity15 used the @entity43 on @entity44 , @entity45 to peer 10.8 billion light years across the universe
together with dr @entity141 she discovered the young galaxy called dla2222 - 0946 that could explain how the @entity3 formed
the young galaxy is so far away that its discovery is ' akin to reading the president 's newspaper in the @entity77 ' from six miles away
