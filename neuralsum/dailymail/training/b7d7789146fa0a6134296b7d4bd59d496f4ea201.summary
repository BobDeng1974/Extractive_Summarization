’ nationally , just 78 per cent of passengers are satisfied with punctuality and reliability of their train services – down three per cent since spring 2012			1
it is the highest level of passenger dissatisfaction with rail networks in six years since 2007 when just 77 per cent of passengers were happy with punctuality			2
commuters in @entity49 and the @entity50 are the most unhappy with punctuality with only three - quarters - 76 per cent - satisfied , compared to 83 per cent on long - distance routes and 81 per cent on regional services			2

survey results : the majority of passengers surveyed by @entity19 said the reliability of their train service and they way rail companies deal with delays is the biggest problem but on one of the worst performing lines , @entity74 's @entity73 route , five out of six passengers said it fails to give value for money			1
only 17 per cent of passengers rated their ticket 's value for money as being satisfactory or good			0

unhappy : overall satisfaction on individual routes around the @entity105 varied between 62 and 95 per cent earlier this month the @entity106 revealed that millions of passengers are being failed by delayed and cancelled trains because @entity109 missed all of its punctuality targets across @entity60 and @entity112			2
passenger focus chief executive @entity113 said : ‘ passengers faced variable performance in the early part of 2013			2
there continues to be a wide gap between the better and weaker performing services - satisfaction with individual operators ranges from 76 per cent to 95 per cent			0
' he added : ‘ value for money by route is even more striking , with satisfaction levels ranging from 17 per cent to 76 per cent			0
mr @entity113 added : ‘ passengers are now the main overall funder of @entity4 's railway , so it is vital that their key needs are met			1
‘ given that performance is the key factor that underpins most passengers ' general view of the railway , train companies and @entity109 must keep striving to get more trains on time			1
’ @entity19 said rail users had faced performance issues caused by poor weather , track and signalling problems , suicides and congestion on the network but that it was ‘ day to day ’ performance that was giving cause for concern			1
it added that on a positive note , cable theft has become much rarer following crackdowns			0
overall satisfaction by individual routes within train companies ' areas varied between 62 per cent and 95 per cent			2

' while some passengers enjoy excellent performance , others suffer significant delays and disruptions			0
the range of satisfaction is between 95 per cent and 55 per cent			0
all passengers need reliable services			2
that is why we have set more stretching targets for the next five years			0

@entity207 , commercial director at the @entity208 , said : ‘ train companies know that to be successful they must meet the needs of passengers and deliver high levels of satisfaction and value for money			1

’ rail minister @entity225 said : ‘ while passenger satisfaction remains generally high , i share passengers ' concerns over punctuality			1

’ @entity254 , general secretary of the @entity256 transport union , said : ' these appalling figures on passenger satisfaction show clearly that the travelling public is sick and tired of paying through the nose to travel on crowded , unreliable trains while the private operating companies are raking in a fortune in profits			1
’ shadow transport secretary @entity265 said : " passengers have every reason to be dissatisfied when rail fares are going up by as much as 9 % a year while delayed and cancelled trains are on the rise			1
’ she added : ’ only last month , rail bosses awarded themselves bonuses on the basis of what they claimed was rising passenger satisfaction , yet these latest figures must surely call those payments into question			1
’ ‘ ministers should now urgently work with the rail regulator to require a change to @entity109 's remuneration scheme so that only actual improvements in performance that benefit passengers are rewarded			1
’ @entity287 , campaigns director for the @entity288 , said : ‘ passengers are unhappy about the value they get for their tickets			1
with the review of fares due , now is the time for @entity230 to end above - inflation ticket price hikes			0
