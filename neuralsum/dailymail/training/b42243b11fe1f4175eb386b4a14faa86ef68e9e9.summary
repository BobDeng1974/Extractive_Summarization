the deputy prime minister said he was ' ignored and derided ' before the @entity4 entered @entity5			1
giving evidence to the @entity3 into media standards , mr @entity2 revealed he questioned @entity13 on his decision to appoint @entity15 as his press secretary in the days after the coalition was formed			1
but the prime minister told him that ' everyone deserves a second chance '			2
the @entity4 leader said prior to the election he was shunned by the @entity23 and was only an observer at the dinner party in december 2009 which @entity26 also attended			1
but after he performed strongly in the first televised debate in the run - up to the last general election , he said that newspapers led a ' vitriolic ' campaign against him			1
mr @entity2 accused the media of going after ' the man rather than the ball ' to tackle the new ' yellow team ' who had come to the field			1
in contrast , the @entity4 leader said when he became leader of the party in 2008 many senior figures did not ' know me from @entity43 '			2
talking about the dinner on december 16 , 2009 that he attended with mr @entity9 , mrs @entity26 and @entity46 editor @entity45 and a number of other people , mr @entity2 said he was little more than ' an observer '			1
' i was at the very end of the table , where the children sit , so to speak , ' he added			0
it is unclear who else was at the dinner			0
the following march he had lunch with @entity58 editor @entity57 , and a ' brief ' meeting with mrs @entity26 and mr @entity9 lasting a maximum of 10 minutes			2
he had also met the media mogul 's son @entity61 twice before in april 2008 and july 2009			0
the @entity4 leader 's appearance before @entity65 meant he avoided frontbench alongside @entity13 at @entity18 's questions today after he ordered his mps not to back @entity69 in the @entity70			1
the prime minister is due to give evidence to @entity65 himself tomorrow			1
@entity74 will force a vote on whether there should be a sleaze inquiry over his handling of the @entity9 empire ’s takeover bid for @entity81			0
mr @entity2 said @entity69 has given a ' full , good and convincing account ' of his handling of the @entity81 bid			0
the deputy prime minister delivered his strongest backing yet for the @entity87 - despite signalling last night that mr @entity69 should be subject to a sleaze probe			1
mr @entity2 said he sought assurances from then cabinet secretary sir @entity90 that @entity92 's attempt to take full control of @entity81 would be handled properly if responsibility was shifted to mr @entity69			1
' i was ready to accept the reassurances , as i did , that the process would have to be conducted in a sort of objective and quasi-judicial manner and that in one sense @entity69 's personal views were as irrelevant as @entity103 's were , ' mr @entity2 said			2
evidence : deputy prime minister @entity2 today said newspapers played the ' man and not the ball ' with attacks on him after he performed well in the first television debate before the general election			1
however , he defended the right of papers to be partisan mr @entity13 has refused to call in sir @entity113 , the independent adviser on the ministerial code of conduct , to investigate if mr @entity69 breached the rules			0
mr @entity69 has faced criticism over his office 's ties with @entity92 lobbyist @entity119			0
tennis partner : @entity92 lobbyist @entity119 's children goes to the same school as @entity2 @entity2 lives near mr @entity119 in @entity124 , south - west @entity125 and has also played tennis with the lobbyist			0
however , he today sought to distance himself from him and said they have barely met since the general election			0
mr @entity2 told @entity65 : ' @entity119 and i first met each other many years ago well before i thought of entering @entity132 politics when he was working at the time for a centre - left think tank			2
' our children go to the same school in south - west @entity125 so i very much knew him before he was employed in his current capacity			0
' my @entity2 added that he had not seen mr @entity119 since november 2010			0
he said : ' since the general election in may 2010 my social contact with him is very very infrequent indeed there was one dinner we were both invited to held by someone we both know in @entity124 in september 2010			2
' @entity2 said he questioned @entity13 about his decision to appoint @entity15 as his press secretary in the days after the election			1
but the new prime minister said that the former @entity149 editor ' deserves a second chance '			2
mr @entity2 said that mr @entity13 was free to make his own appointments			2
the @entity4 leader told the inquiry : ' i said to the prime minister " is this the right thing to do given the controversy around @entity15 and my party 's view on him ? "			1
' @entity2 today praised the @entity158 for their ' outstanding ' campaign to have @entity161 's killers brought to justice			1
the deputy prime minister said it was important that newspapers led campaigns and that politicians responded to them			1
@entity161 and @entity168 were jailed for life in january for the racist murder of 18 - year - old a-level student @entity161 in @entity171 , south @entity125 , in april 1993			0
the @entity158 campaigned for justice for @entity161 's parents @entity173 and @entity175 , culminating in the landmark convictions			1
mr @entity2 said : ' the @entity158 's outstanding campaign on bringing the murderers of @entity161 to justice was a brave campaign and undoubtedly justified			1
' he also praised the @entity179 for pursuing phone - hacking and said it was a ' virtue ' of the @entity132 press that they launched such campaigns			2
but mr @entity2 said mr @entity13 replied that he ' felt , as he put it , he deserved a second chance			1
a lot of the allegations we now know were not known to us then and this conversation would have been quite different			0
' in a @entity191 the prime minister has a right to make choices about who he appoints to his team which i ca n't , and would n't ever , seek to veto			0
' mr @entity2 gave details of an apparent warning over the @entity81 bid which was conveyed though his then parliamentary aide @entity201			0
the mp had been told ' that it would be good for the @entity4 to be open to the bid , otherwise we would expect no favourable treatment from the @entity9 press ' , according to the deputy prime minister			1
' @entity201 was quite agitated about that , ' mr @entity2 went on			0
' as we had not received particularly favourable treatment in the first place i did not think it was a particularly credible threat			0
' mr @entity2 said newspapers led an at times ' vitriolic ' campaign against him in the run - up to the last general election after he performed strongly in the first television debate between the three party leaders			1
he said the @entity23 had gone from being ' indifferent at best ' to ' lashing out ' after his ratings spiked in the polls			0
' if that is what you are used to in the press it must come as a bit of a shock , i guess , when you suddenly have these people who you have been either ignoring or deriding suddenly doing well in a general election , you start lashing out a bit and that is what happened , ' mr @entity2 said			1
however , he defended the right of newspapers to hold whatever editorial positions they want			0
asked by @entity238 about a @entity58 editorial before the election which said ' vote @entity2 and you will get @entity241 , he responded : ' editorials are about expressing partial opinion and i would defend that to the death			0
' mr @entity2 said his contacts with journalists and media executives were more formal since entering government , partly because he was based in @entity250 rather than @entity251			2
mr @entity2 said his contact with national newspaper editors had been infrequent - although there had been a spike in the run - up to last year 's @entity258 referendum			2
discussing his meetings with editors and proprietors , he said he often could not remember what they talked about			0
' all of these meetings are a whole lot less intriguing and surprising , i suspect , to the outside world than it might initially seem , ' mr @entity2 insisted			0
' a lot of them are fairly humdrum			0
' he praised the @entity23 for their ' campaigning zeal ' - which he contrasted with that of foreign media			1
he said without the @entity179 's pursuit of phone - hacking , the @entity3 would never have happened			0
he told the inquiry : ' it is one of the great virtues of our press that we 've got the campaigning zeal in our press – i think readers like it and it 's something we should celebrate .			2

@entity2 said he had only brief contact with @entity9 and @entity26 at the dinner party in 2009
@entity4 leader accuses newspapers of launching a ' vitriolic ' attack against him when the ' yellow team ' entered the field in television debates before the general election
@entity13 said ' everyone deserves a second chance ' when questioned by mr @entity2 about appointment of @entity15 as press secretary
