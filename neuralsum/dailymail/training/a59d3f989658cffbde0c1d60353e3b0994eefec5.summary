by @entity0 published : 20:24 est , 30 april 2012 updated : 20:24 est , 30 april 2012 @entity2 will be visible as a blot against the @entity4 in june in a rare ' transit ' in front of the star - the phenomenon is so uncommon that the next one will be in 2117			1
the transits of @entity2 in front of the sun to calculate the distance from @entity12 to the sun in 1769 - using a method proposed by astronomer @entity15 , after whom the comet is named			1
on 5 and 6 june , @entity2 will appear as a small black dot on the @entity4 's surface in a rare transit , taking six hours to complete its journey			1
@entity2 transits in front of the sun in 2004 : the orbits of the two planets are angled oddly , so the next transit wo n't be until 2117 transits of @entity2 occur only on the very rare occasions when @entity2 and the @entity12 are in a line with the @entity4 at other times @entity2 passes below or above the @entity4 because the two orbits are at a slight angle to each other			1
transits occur in pairs separated by eight years , with the gap between pairs of transits alternating between 105.5 and 121.5 years – the last transit was in 2004			0
in 1716 , @entity15 proposed using a transit of @entity2 to predict the precise distance between the @entity12 and the @entity4 , known as the astronomical unit			1
as a result , hundreds of expeditions were sent all over the world to observe the 1761 and 1769 transits			0
a young @entity44 took the @entity45 to the island of @entity47 , where he successfully observed the transit at a site that is still called @entity50			0
transits of @entity2 only occur when @entity2 and the @entity12 are in line with the @entity4 , as normally it passes below or above the @entity4 because the two orbits are at a slight angle to each other , reports journal @entity55			2
the journey usually occurs in pairs separated by eight years , with the gap between pairs of transits alternating between 105.5 and 121.5 years			0
the last transit happened in 2004			0
@entity60 scientists are hoping the transit will confirm their theory about a phenomenon called ' the black - drop effect ' - a strange , dark band linking @entity2 's silhouette with the sky outside the @entity4 that appears for about a minute , starting just as @entity2 first enters the solar disk			2
they will concentrate on observing @entity2 's atmosphere as it appears when the planet is only half on to the solar disk , believing observations will help astronomers who are looking for extrasolar planets orbiting stars other than the @entity4 @entity78 , an astronomer at @entity79 , @entity60 , said : ‘ doing so verifies that the techniques for studying events on and around other stars hold true in our own backyard			2
in 1769 , teams of astronomers around the world used the transit of @entity2 to calculate the distance from the @entity12 to the @entity4 ‘ in other words , by looking up close at transits in our solar system , we may be able to see subtle effects that can help exoplanet hunters explain what they are seeing when they view distant suns			1
' we are fortunate in that we are truly living in a golden period of planetary transits and it is one of which i hope astronomers can take full advantage			0

rare phenomenon will not be seen again for more than a century
@entity2 will be visible as a black dot in front of the sun for five or six hours
