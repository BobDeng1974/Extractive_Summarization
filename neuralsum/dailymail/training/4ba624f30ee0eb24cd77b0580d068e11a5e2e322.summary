only rarely is it possible for spectators to watch @entity2 in action for more than 90 minutes without having to go through a turnstile			1
rarer still is to see the former @entity7 captain virtually motionless , speaking almost in a whisper at times , and standing with his hands clasped in front of him as if in silent prayer			0
but anyone at @entity15 ’ court yesterday got a glimpse of the other @entity2			1
not the @entity18 defender aggressively tackling his opponents on the pitch			1
evidence : @entity25 leaves the court yesterday with friends @entity2 , who denies the claim , arrived at court on monday looking as if he had just left a wedding in his expensive grey suit and pink tie			1
yesterday the outfit was bordering on funereal – a midnight blue suit , black tie and highly polished black shoes			0
to begin with , mr @entity2 , as prosecuting lawyer @entity48 addressed him , was asked to place the various insults , banter and confrontations commonplace in top class football into rank order			1
‘ handbags ’ , the 31 - year - old @entity18 skipper agreed , was how commentators tended to define clashes that did n’t result in fists , headbutts and outright violence			1
then there were the insults			0
‘ you ’re ugly , ’ was probably at the lower end of the scale and was commonplace , @entity2 agreed			2
ditto ‘ you ’re fat ’			0
comments about players ’ wives and girlfriends ? ‘ i ’ve had that , ’ @entity2 said			2
mr @entity48 : ‘ a player might say , “ i had your wife ... i s * * * * * * your girlfriend , that sort of thing ? ” ’ @entity2 : ‘ yes			2
’ @entity2 allegedly made racist comments to @entity36 defender @entity25 during a match on october 23 last year but there were no - go areas			1
‘ how about , “ your mum ’s a s * * * ” ? have you heard that said to other players ? ’ mr @entity48 asked			0
@entity2 : ‘ no , only to myself			2
’ what about insults concerning what mr @entity48 called his ‘ domestic circumstances ’ – @entity2 is alleged to have reacted after @entity25 accused him of ‘ s * * * * * * * @entity89 ’s missus ’ , a reference to his relationship with model @entity92 , who had been dating his former colleague @entity94			1
was that a no - go area ? ‘ apparently not , ’ said @entity2 , adding that fans had long heckled him over it			2
mr @entity48 : ‘ so when someone enters a no - go area , you strike back ? ’ @entity2 : ‘ no , i do n’t strike back			2
’ mr @entity48 : ‘ you ’re the innocent victim are you ? ’ @entity2 : ‘ yes			2
’ mr @entity48 : ‘ too right			0
you ’ve been stitched up right and proper have n’t you ? ’ @entity2 : ‘ yeah			2
’ former @entity7 soccer captain and @entity18 player @entity2 , centre , arrives at @entity15 ' courts in @entity105 under further questioning , @entity2 denied he had ‘ snapped ’ when @entity25 abused him , or that his ‘ blood was up ’			1
@entity2 told mr @entity48 he had never been accused on a football pitch of making racist remarks			1
‘ at the time i was shocked and angry , ’ he said			1
‘ hindsight ’s a wonderful thing			0
at the time i was shocked , i was angry , you ca n’t control your emotions			1
’ the court heard that @entity2 had told detectives that using racist terms was ‘ completely unacceptable ’			1
he had also told police of his work with the @entity121 charities of two black former @entity18 colleagues , @entity123 and striker @entity124 , adding : ‘ my commitment to these projects further demonstrates that i am not a racist			1
’ at one stage in confrontation with @entity25 , he admitted , he had waved his hand in front of his nose to gesture that his opponent had ‘ bad breath ’ – but he had not intended to humiliate him			1
@entity25 's mother @entity136 arrives at @entity23 for the second day of @entity2 trial in the dock : @entity2 watches on as his alleged race abuse victim @entity25 gives evidence in this artist 's impression of proceedings why not just tell him to calm down ? ‘ you would n’t see many footballers when they square up saying “ calm down ” , ’ @entity2 replied			1
why did he gesture in the same game that @entity36 goalkeeper @entity146 was fat ? was that ‘ handbags ’ too ? ‘ yes , ’ said @entity2 , adding that his rivals sometimes called him fat			2
mr @entity48 : ‘ you ’re not fat though are you ? you ’re a supreme athlete			0
’ @entity2 : ‘ i used to be ... ’ scandal : @entity2 's alleged comments came in response to taunts by the other player about his alleged affair with an ex-team - mate 's girlfriend , @entity92 , pictured , the prosecution said had he thought about apologising to @entity25 ? ‘ why would i apologise to @entity25 ? ’ he replied			1
‘ he ’s the one who accused me			0
’ @entity2 told the court that it had actually been @entity25 who had first used racist terms during the flare - up			1
as the pair traded insults , he claims to have heard @entity25 say : ‘ calling me a black c * * * ? ’ he said : ‘ i thought he was accusing me of calling him a black c * * *			1
i was very angry and i was upset			0
i replied , “ a black c * * * ? you f * * * * * * k * * * head ”			0
’ this second day of the hearing was played out to a packed court			0
outside , passing van drivers displaying @entity18 colours tooted support on their horns ; inside , the legal files , coincidentally , were coloured blue and white			2
@entity2 was in the witness box for a total of two hours , which , even on his wages of £ 160,000 a week , almost certainly worked out less in hourly rates than the collective fees of the lawyers involved in the case			1
earlier @entity2 told the court he shook @entity25 ’s hand in the dressing room after asking to see him after the match			1
‘ we ’ve got a little bit of superstition at @entity18 , ’ he said			0
‘ me , @entity194 [ @entity195 ] , @entity196 and [ @entity198 ] @entity197 all get changed together – until we lose , then we change sequence			0
‘ by this stage i ’m already changed			0
i ’m in the toilet doing my hair			0
as i come out , me and @entity25 passed			0
’ @entity2 said he asked the @entity36 defender if he was suggesting he had been racially abused			0
@entity25 ’s response ? ‘ no , no , no. we all say things we should n’t			0
that ’s the end of it			0
’ this case is listed to run until the end of the week			0
if you do n’t want to know the result , look away then			0
