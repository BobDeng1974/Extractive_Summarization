by @entity0 e-cigarettes must be subject to much more stringent controls to ensure they are safe , leading health experts have warned			1
more than 100 of them have sent an open letter to the @entity6 , outlining their concerns about what unregulated products may contain			1
they fear manufacturers of electronic nicotine devices are ' making false and unproven claims , misleading the public into thinking these products are harmless ( they are not ) and effective cessation aids ( which is unknown ) '			1
manufacturers of e-cigarettes are ' making false and unproven claims , misleading the public into thinking these products are harmless , health experts have warned the letter , to @entity6 director general @entity21 , is in response to one sent last month by 53 other experts			1
it was written after information was apparently leaked that the @entity6 wanted to class e-cigarettes as a tobacco product because they were a ' threat '			1
in the letter , the experts argued that e-cigarettes could be among the most significant health innovations of the 21st century and could save millions of lives			1
another new study published in a special supplement of @entity36 , found that the market of e-cigarettes is growing rapidly			0
researchers from the @entity39 sought to identify the number of these products available online			2
they did two separate internet searches of @entity44 language websites , the first between may and august in 2012 and the second between december 2013 and january 2014			0
in the period between searches there was a net increase of 10.5 new brands and 242 new flavours every month , they said			2
by january 2014 , they identified 466 brands with 7,764 unique flavours			0
as a result , they stated they should not be classed as a tobacco product , which would restrict their access - and have huge consequences on public health			2
but the latest letter , organised by tobacco scientist @entity66 of the @entity68 , urges the opposite - and calls for more rigorous investigation into the devices			1
the group of 129 experts from 31 countries wrote : ' by moving to the e-cigarette market , the tobacco industry is only maintaining its predatory practices and increasing profits			1
' the aggressive marketing and promotion of e-cigarettes to youth is well documented and evidence shows rapid growth in youth e-cigarette use , including disturbing rates among youth who have never smoked a cigarette			0
' from a population perspective it is important to know what new risks a consumer product may introduce to the market			0
' e-cigarettes use battery - powered cartridges to produce a nicotine hit via inhalable vapor without the tar and other carcinogens in inhaled tobacco smoke			0
the latest letter says manufacturers should be required to present data that show the products are safe and help smokers quit , and disclose ingredients in the ' vaping ' liquid the devices burn			1
regulating e-cigarettes like tobacco products , the signatories wrote , is necessary to prevent young people from starting to use them , protect bystanders in public areas from involuntary exposure , regulate marketing , and ban unsubstantiated claims			2
figures show that e-cigarettes are most commonly used by ex-smokers - often as away of giving up or cutting down on regular cigarettes they add that although e-cigarette vapor has fewer toxic components than regular smoke , more than half a dozen studies have shown it can include ultrafine particles damaging to lungs , plus ' carcinogens and reproductive toxins , including benzene , lead , nickel , and others '			0
the @entity6 is assessing its position on e-cigarettes , and has indicated it is leaning toward restrictions like those on all nicotine - containing products , including banning advertising and flavours			1
the call comes as new research showed that almost 30 million people around @entity148 have tried the battery operated nicotine products			2
a new study published in the journal @entity36 found that 20.3 per cent of current smokers , 4.7 per cent of ex-smokers and 1.2 per cent of people who had never smoked had tried an e-cigarette at least once			0
the researchers , from @entity158 , the @entity39 and @entity159 , say that when the figures are extrapolated , this means 29.3 million @entity148 adults have tried the products			0
but they added the scientific community is yet to provide information regarding the harm or efficacy of e-cigarettes			0
health , financial and social reasons are factors why people use e-cigarettes , according to a recent poll			0

129 health experts have written to the @entity6
are concerned about the safety of ingredients in unregulated products
claim manufacturers bare making ' false and unproven claims '
comes after letter last month from 53 other experts who claimed acess to the devices should not be restricted , as they ' could save millions of lives '
