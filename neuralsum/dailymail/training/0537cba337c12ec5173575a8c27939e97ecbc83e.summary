by @entity0 murdered soldier @entity1 will ' burn in hellfire ' and those who killed him should be considered martyrs , hate preacher @entity5 has said in another poisonous rant on film			1
the extremist maintains that despite being executed in barbaric circumstances the 25 - year - old father of one deserves no sympathy because he is a ' non-muslim ' and called one suspect a ' nice man '			1
it is yet another vile outburst by @entity5 , who insists on using @entity1 's murder to stir up hatred , but police will still not arrest him			1
he has persistently refused to condemn the murder in @entity22 almost a fortnight ago and blames ' war monger ' @entity24 for radicalising young @entity26 @entity25 to the extent they carry out acts of terror			2
rally : @entity31 ( circled ) pictured at a demonstration in @entity33 , @entity34 , in 2007 with @entity5 message : the @entity36 said that suspect @entity31 ( left ) was a ' nice man '			1
@entity31 and @entity37 ( right ) have been charged with @entity1 's murder tragic : drummer @entity1 died in the street as he walked back to his barracks in @entity22 , but @entity5 says the @entity41 teaches that there should be no sympathy for non-muslims a video uncovered by @entity46 , shows the preacher , who claims £ 25,000 a year in benefits , saying that the people who murdered @entity1 will go to ' @entity50 '			1
two men have been charged with the murder and @entity5 knew at least one of them , and today called one of the suspects , @entity31 , 28 , a ' nice man '			1
message : ' i think you need to blame the people who are inciting and who are radicalising these youths , which is really the @entity26 government , ' @entity5 said @entity64 in an office near his mosque in north - east @entity34 , he would not denounce the soldier 's death			1
' so as an adult @entity67 , whether he is part of the @entity69 or not part of the @entity69 , if he dies in a state of disbelief then he is going to go to the hellfire			0
that ’s what i believe so i ’m not going to feel sorry for non-muslims			0
' @entity5 went on that the @entity26 government is to blame for @entity1 's death , which is a ' drop in the ocean '			1
' i think you need to blame the people who are inciting and who are radicalising these youths , which is really the @entity26 government			2
' you need to take into account the hundreds of thousands of incidents of people slaughtered , of weddings bombed , of @entity25 tortured , of innocent people kept in prison for over ten years			0
' he also attacked the charity @entity90 , which helps care for injured @entity26 soldiers , saying they can not be heroes because they ' shoot children in @entity96 '			1
later extremist @entity5 insisted he had not ' said anything incendiary ' and claims he does not fear being arrested			1
' it was an hour long interview , and a couple of clips have been taken out of context , ' he said			0
' all i was saying is i do n't believe he ( @entity5 ) will go to paradise			2
it is not a hate crime			0
i was not inciting anyone , or doing anything illegal			0
' most religions around the world are based on the same thing , if you do not believe you will go to hell			0
' what is a hate crime , anyway ? i do n't think there is such a law			0
you can not arrest someone for what they think			0
' yesterday the two men accused of killing @entity1 made separate appearances in court charged with his murder and other offences			2
@entity31 , 28 , of @entity127 , @entity128 , appeared at @entity129 , and raised his arm into a @entity131 pose , and kissed a copy of the @entity41 with his eyes closed			2
in an animated hearing he also stooped in the dock with a large bandage on his left arm , refused to stand and the 28 - year - old also demanded to be called ‘ @entity139 ’			0
meanwhile @entity37 , 22 , of @entity140 , south - east @entity34 , appeared at the @entity141 via video link			0
