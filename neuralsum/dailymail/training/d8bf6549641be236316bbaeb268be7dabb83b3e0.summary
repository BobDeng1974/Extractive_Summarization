last year the boy , from nearby @entity40 , tied the knot with bride @entity9 after claiming he had been told by his dead ancestors to wed. shockingly his family took the message from the heavens seriously and hurriedly forked out £ 500 for the bride and a further £ 1,000 for the big day			1
but little @entity37 - the youngest of five children - would n't rest until the couple followed through with @entity18 traditions insisting they have the second ceremony to make their marriage official			1
