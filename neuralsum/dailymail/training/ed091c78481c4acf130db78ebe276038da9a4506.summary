@entity0 has already fielded phone calls from clubs interested in @entity3 – and admits it is perhaps inevitable he will one day be lured from @entity5			1
the 20 - year - old left back – signed from @entity7 for just £ 2.85million in the summer – has already made a big impression at the @entity9 and scored @entity11 ’s goal during their 3 - 1 defeat to @entity13 in midweek			1
that rampaging raid on the opposition penalty area won him comparison to @entity18 , and it is the @entity21 star ’s former club , @entity19 , who @entity3 faces on sunday			1
@entity3 ( right ) has impressed since moving to @entity5 from @entity7 @entity3 scores for @entity11 against @entity13 at @entity23 on november 18 @entity3 celebrates his goal which made it 2 - 1 but it proved in vain as @entity13 won 3 - 1 but @entity26 boss @entity0 concedes that , like @entity18 and former @entity29 teenager @entity28 , it might not be too long before bigger clubs come calling with serious offers			1
‘ there has already been one or two with phone calls asking “ to keep me informed ” , ’ says @entity0 , whose side are without a win in four in the @entity34			2
‘ that ’s always the first stage			2
i had it with ( @entity41 ) @entity40 when i was at @entity42 and then ( @entity44 ) @entity43 when he went off to @entity45			2
and if this kid keeps performing the way he is then it might become inevitable			2
‘ look at @entity28 – he only played one year , did n’t he ? that ’s how crazy it is : £ 32million , you could buy the @entity52 for that ! ’ @entity3 , an attacking defender , is very much in the mould of @entity18 and @entity28			1
and that is a likeness @entity0 welcomes			2
@entity26 ' boss @entity0 believes the 20 - year - old can only get better after impressing for his country @entity0 believes @entity3 is similar in style to @entity21 's @entity18 @entity3 has also drawn comparisons to @entity28 , who picked up an injury in @entity7 's win over @entity64 ‘ these days , the higher up you go , the full - backs play as wing - backs , ’ he said			1
‘ the modern game is such that they really do give you the width			0
if you look at all the top teams the two full - backs are high up the pitch constantly and that will always suit @entity75			0
‘ he wants to get forward , he ’s no mean defender himself but he ’s blessed with this ability to run quickly and it seems effortless for him			1
’ @entity0 , though , also sounded caution , as he added : ‘ we will have to protect him over the next couple of years i would have thought , but certainly if he keeps improving the way he is then he ’s got a wonderful future ahead of him			0
‘ but he ’s the type who wants to do well , he wants to improve , he wants to be a top player			0
he has got all that drive in him so we will make sure he does n’t get carried away with himself because we have got arguably one of the best young players in the country			0
’ @entity5 ’s scouting team had tracked @entity3 for the bulk of last season and strongly advised @entity0 to follow through with their recommendation			1
@entity3 returned to his old school this week as part of a @entity99 event it was something the manager had no hesitation in doing			1
‘ there is a lot of hard work that goes on beneath ( the signing ) , ’ he revealed			0
' my scouts followed him and it ’s all their hard work			0
i made the decision to say yes because the people i employ said “ yes ”			0
‘ but you just had to look at him at @entity7 last year – the natural aspects and think “ wow ”			1
‘ as soon as you see him whoosh up that line you go “ bloomin ’ heck ”			0
there are not many people that move like that very often			0
it ’s reward for everybody at the club , but more rewarding for him than anybody			0
