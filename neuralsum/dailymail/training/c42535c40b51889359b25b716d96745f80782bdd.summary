by @entity0 struggle : @entity2 and @entity3 with their sons @entity6 shunned @entity7 calls to overhaul the 40p tax rate yesterday – as he again focused resources on basic - rate taxpayers			2
the chancellor announced the starting threshold for paying income tax would rise again to £ 10,500 next year , delivering a £ 100 tax cut just before the election			1
mr @entity6 also confirmed that the threshold at which individuals start paying the higher rate will be raised this year for the first time since the 2010 general election – but by just 1 per cent this year and a further 1 per cent in 2015			1
@entity21 warned the failure to raise the threshold in line with inflation would result in an extra 411,000 people being dragged into paying the 40p rate by 2016			1
the higher rate threshold will rise from £ 41,450 today to £ 41,865 next month before rising to £ 42,285 next year			1
but the figure remains well below the £ 43,875 threshold inherited by the @entity31 , who brought it down to £ 42,475 in 2011 - 12 , froze it in 2012 - 2013 and cut it again to £ 41,450 last year			1
the number of people paying 40p tax has soared from just over three million in 2010 to 4.4million this year and is set to rise to more than 4.8million by 2016			2
@entity37 had pressed for the higher rate threshold to be increased to at least £ 44,000 to ease the pressure on the huge numbers of ordinary workers now forced to pay it			1
but liberal democrat @entity43 , chief secretary to the treasury , boasted last night that his party had vetoed any further action			0
mr @entity43 said he had refused to listen to ‘ siren voices in the @entity48 ’ calling for action on the issue			0
former @entity7 cabinet minister @entity51 welcomed mr @entity6 ’s slight raise to the 40p tax threshold but said he should have been much bolder			2
‘ i ’m glad there was some movement , but we would have liked it to go further , ’ he said			0
‘ we wanted the chancellor to recognise that people earning just over £ 40,000 are not rich and should not be taxed as if they are			0
but unfortunately there are always compromises in coalition			0
’ @entity62 , director general at the @entity63 , said the failure to overhaul the 40p rate was a ‘ missed opportunity ’			0
he added : ‘ under @entity6 nearly 1.5million more taxpayers are paying this rate			0
‘ this is an attack on aspiration and entrepreneurship			0
whilst the increase in the personal allowance is a welcome move , it should not have come at the expense of tax cuts in other areas			0
’ the starting threshold for paying income tax will rise from £ 9,440 to £ 10,000 next month and to £ 10,500 next year			1
mr @entity6 yesterday stressed the long - term progress on raising the basic - rate threshold , which stood at just £ 6,500 in 2010			1
delivering the budget : chancellor @entity6 in the @entity84 today he said 25million people had benefited from a tax cut as a result , with three million lifted out of income tax altogether			1
basic - rate taxpayers will pay £ 800 a year less in income tax by the time of the election			1
the chancellor said higher rate taxpayers earning less than £ 100,000 would receive the ‘ full benefit ’ of the latest increases			2
but @entity97 , tax director at accountants @entity99 , questioned the claim , saying the benefit was ‘ not being passed on to those on the cusp of the higher rate tax threshold ’			2
‘ the personal allowance will increase by £ 560 this year , however the higher rate tax threshold has only been increased by £ 415 , ’ she said			1
‘ therefore there is still an actual reduction in the basic rate tax band of £ 145 – not as generous as it might have seemed			2
’ @entity110 leader @entity109 said it was ‘ amazing ’ that a @entity48 chancellor would enter the next general election with a lower 40p threshold than he inherited from the previous government			0
‘ lots of aspirational families will be forgiven for wondering why they bother to go the extra mile			0
the danger for the economy is that some will simply stop doing so			0

threshold for paying income tax will rise to £ 10,500 - a £ 100 tax cut
higher rate threshold will rise from £ 41,450 to £ 41,865 next month
up to £ 42,285 next year - much less than the £ 43,875 inherited by @entity31
means an extra 411,000 will be dragged into rate by 2016
