goals : @entity16 18 , @entity17 84 @entity6 came into the game unbeaten at home and had only conceded two goals			1
but @entity2 had @entity16 on a run of scoring in four straight games , @entity65 going back where he shone for @entity6 in the @entity82 and scored 14 goals in 69 matches , and @entity28 who had already scored 20 goals in 11 games and they were always going to prove to be their biggest challenge of the season			1
real started strongly and @entity28 almost scored on 12 minutes when played in by @entity17 on the edge of the six - yard box			1
the @entity92 striker got his shot away quickly but @entity39 made the reflex save			0
@entity6 responded with their first chance and @entity59 needed to be at his best to tip of a header from @entity97 over the bar			0
@entity2 took the lead on 18 minutes when @entity100 stormed down the left and crossed for @entity16 to poke the ball past @entity39			1
@entity16 could have scored from another @entity28 assist on the half hour when @entity28 ’s free - kick was saved by @entity39 and ran to the @entity105 but @entity40 reacted quickly and cleared			1
five minutes before the break @entity28 slipped a pass through for @entity17 but @entity39 came off his line quickly to palm the ball away for a corner			1
the home side ’s keeper was keeping @entity6 in the game and just before the break they so nearly took full advantage of that when @entity45 hammered a free - kick against @entity59 ’ cross-bar			0
@entity28 provided the assists for both @entity16 and @entity17 as @entity2 won 2 - 1 in @entity6 @entity28 tries to make full contact with the ball through an acrobatic kick in @entity2 's game against @entity6 on saturday evening @entity2 kept up the pressure in the second half with @entity17 heading just over from @entity66 ’ free - kick and @entity65 charging through only to see @entity39 smother his shot			1
all the time there was just one goal in the game @entity6 sensed they had a chance and @entity52 went close from a corner with a header that just cleared the crossbar			0
@entity6 were also boosted by signs of fatigue from @entity2			0
@entity16 went off exhausted with 15 minutes left to be replaced by @entity136 but any number of tired @entity2 players could have made way			2
@entity2 ’s incredible winning run began back in october when they beat @entity141 5 - 1 in the @entity82			0
they had won 10 games in the league and four more in @entity144 since then with two victories over @entity146 and big @entity148 victory over @entity21 the standout results			0
but they came into the game with some concerns about fatigue			0
midfielder @entity66 has played an incredible 88 games in the last year and a half and had to start this game with @entity2 coping without the injured @entity156			2
@entity65 ( right ) was sent off in the final moments of the game for @entity2 on his return to his former club the real team celebrate after @entity16 ( second left ) had scored to put them into the lead after 18 minutes @entity2 's margin of victory could have been greater had it not been for a number of important saves from @entity6 's @entity39 ( left ) @entity17 ( left ) hugs @entity28 ( second left ) after the @entity92 international set up the second goal for @entity2 @entity17 ( right ) view for the ball with @entity6 's @entity43 ( left ) during their @entity19 clash on saturday @entity65 ( right ) tries to take the ball beyond @entity6 's @entity92 player @entity48 @entity28 missed a great late chance to score a second when a defensive lapse allowed him to connect with a @entity17 cross but @entity39 again made the save			1
that made for a nervous last ten minutes and a @entity59 fumble almost let @entity52 in but @entity136 cleared to prevent the goal			0
with seven minutes left @entity17 brought an end to the anxiety when @entity28 flicked the ball into his path and the @entity186 stormed through taking two touches to get the ball out of his feet before he hammered it past @entity39			1
there still some more late drama when @entity65 was harshly sent off for a second yellow card offence , @entity46 hit a post from a corner and @entity52 converted a 92nd minute header			0
it was , however , just a consolation as @entity2 took the points and @entity0 took the record .			2

@entity16 put @entity2 ahead on 18 minutes , converting @entity28 's cross from close range
@entity39 kept @entity2 at *bay* in the second half with a string of *impressive* stops before @entity17 scored
the victory is @entity2 's 16th consecutive win in all competitions , a new club record
