@entity7 said last night : ' our long - term economic plan is all about backing the do - ers and the hard - workers – and no one does more or works as hard in @entity5 today than our farmers			1

’ ‘ it ’s a triple win – and will mean a brighter future for our country			1
’ @entity5 currently imports 40 per cent of its food , including many products which could be produced domestically			2
the government is desperate to reduce imports , to support @entity5 farmers and to end our reliance on unreliable foreign supply chains			0
