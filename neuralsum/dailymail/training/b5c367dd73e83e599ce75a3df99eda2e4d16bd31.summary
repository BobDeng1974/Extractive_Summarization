by @entity1 reporter guilty : sir @entity2 , 20 , admitted to raping a 14 - year - old girl at a @entity5 high school in 2011 when he was 18 a @entity5 judge has sparked national outrage after implying a 14 - year - old rape victim was promiscuous and was not ' the victim she claimed to be '			1
state district judge @entity10 this week stunned the court by sentencing self - confessed rapist , sir @entity2 , to a mild 45 - day prison term and five year probation , instead of the maximum 20 - year jail stint			1
@entity2 , 20 , pleaded guilty to raping the girl at @entity17 , @entity18 , in 2011 when he was 18 , even as she cried out ' no ' and ' stop '			1
while @entity2 will be labeled a sex offender for life , @entity19 exempted him from standard sex offender restrictions : he does n't have to stay away from children , attend sex offender treatment , undergo a sex offender evaluation or refrain from watching pornography			1
@entity19 told @entity29 she issued the light sentence based partially on medical records which indicated the girl had three sexual partners and had given birth to a baby			1
she also described @entity2 as ' not your typical sex offender '			2
' my job is not to make people happy			0
my job is to follow the @entity42 and do the right thing			0
i will always do the right thing , ' she said			0
however the ruling has shocked and devastated the victim , now 17 , who denies having ever been pregnant			2
' i have never been pregnant ever , ' she told @entity48			2
' and three partners ? i do n’t even know where she got this			0
i feel like this was her way of trying to make herself feel better			0
' she said she was just starting to come to terms with the rape and her decision to prosecute her attacker , until she heard @entity19 's comments			1
' it was a slap in the face , ' she said			0
' i thought i was going to get help			0
i thought that it would be taken care of , and i would n’t have to worry about it anymore			0
' she had testified during the trial that she said ' no ' and ' stop ' during the assault and had only wanted to kiss him			1
' i did what i was supposed to do			0
i went to the law about this situation , ' she said			0
' ( but the sentence ) that says everything i went through was for nothing			2
' she added : ' it would have been better for me not to say anything			0
@entity2 , meanwhile , testified last week that he is engaged and his fiancée is pregnant			2
they plan to get married on her birthday in november , according to @entity29			0
he also reportedly is about to start a new job			0
scene : @entity17 ( pictured ) , where sir @entity2 raped a 14 - year - old girl , has since added a window to the room where the rape happened although judge @entity19 publicly declared her sentence was appropriate , she has been criticized by parts of the legal community and advocates for sexual assault victims			1
her requirement that @entity2 complete community service at a local rape crisis sentence has caused particular outrage			1
@entity111 , executive director of the @entity112 , said she refuses to welcome @entity2			2
' i ’m sure she ( @entity114 ) probably thought that it was his way of giving back perhaps , ' she told @entity48			2
' but it ’s just not an appropriate place for him to do his community supervision			2
' @entity111 slammed the ' lenient ' conditions passed down by @entity19 , who is known in legal circles for her creative approach to sentencing			2
rejected : judge @entity10 ordered rapist sir @entity2 to undertake community service at @entity112 ( pictured )			1
management said he was n't welcome taking a stand : @entity111 ( pictured ) , executive director of the @entity112 , said the center is ' just not an appropriate place for him ( sir @entity2 ) to do his community supervision ' ' it is a deterrent to all survivors when you see a very lenient sentence like this passed down , ' @entity111 told @entity48			1
' it sends a devastating message to survivors of sexual assault			0
that victim ’s family definitely did n’t feel like there was justice for her and for other survivors of sexual assault			0
' @entity2 's sentence of deferred adjudication probation means that if he meets various terms laid down by @entity19 , he will not have a permanent criminal record			1
as well as the community service order , he must also spend 45 days in jail , as well as a further 24 hours in jail every october 4 - the date of the rape - for the duration of his probation			1
@entity19 removed herself from the case on friday , and a new judge has taken over			1
during the trial , the court heard that @entity2 and the girl were kissing in a practice room at the performing arts school , but that she had told him to stop when he began rubbing her body			1
ignoring her pleas , he instead pulled off her leggings and raped her			0
' i did n’t want to do anything other than kiss , ' the victim told the court , adding that she had told @entity2 ' no ' and ' stop ' before and during the attack			1
@entity17 has since added a window to the room and installed @entity179 cameras .			0
