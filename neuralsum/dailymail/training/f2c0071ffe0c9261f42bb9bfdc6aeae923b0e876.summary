by @entity0 published : 20:45 est , 20 january 2014 updated : 05:09 est , 21 january 2014 @entity2 did n't go into details about what happened , but somewhere during the offseason he felt slighted by @entity7 wide receiver @entity6			1
it made his final play of sunday 's @entity11 championship game that much more special for @entity14 's @entity13 cornerback			1
it was one of the few moments that @entity7 quarterback @entity17 decided to challenge @entity2 , trying to find @entity6 on a throw to the end zone in the final minute			1
and @entity2 was up to the challenge , deflecting the pass into the air long enough for teammate @entity23 to race over and intercept the pass to clinch @entity14 's 23 - 17 win and the second @entity27 trip in franchise history			1
' it 's a small part of who i am ' : @entity2 said adrenaline and a long - standing grudge made him launch his attack on @entity6 crucial moment : @entity2 ( 25 ) hit the ball away from @entity7 's @entity6 ( 15 ) to prevent a game winning touchdown in the dying moments of last night 's @entity40 game @entity2 gives the camera some ' crazy eyes ' after insulting 49ers receiver @entity6 ' i think everybody in the stadium was surprised , ' @entity2 said			1
' you throw that , that 's just a mistake			0
' @entity2 stole the spotlight of the @entity11 title game between his athletic deflection , his taunting of @entity6 that followed and his television rant on the field after @entity54 took a knee to run off the final seconds			1
while @entity23 was celebrating the interception , @entity2 exchanged words with @entity6 , got shoved in the face as a rebuttal then made a choking gesture toward the @entity7 bench that he said was intended for @entity17			2
@entity2 ran over to @entity6 and gave him a pat on the backside , then appeared to extend his arm for a handshake			2
instead , @entity2 got shoved in the face before picking up his personal foul as his celebration continued			0
asked about the incident afterward by @entity72 reporter @entity71 , @entity2 lit up @entity73 with a rant that began : ' i 'm the best corner in the game			1
when you try me with a sorry receiver like @entity6 , that 's the result you gon na get			1
do n't you ever talk about me ! ' @entity2 did n't back down even after getting some time to collect his thoughts			2
he apologized to @entity71 , then proceeded to call @entity6 ' mediocre ' , making sure to annunciate each syllable of the word			2
' i was making sure everybody knew @entity6 was a mediocre receiver , ' @entity2 said			1
' and when you try the best corner in the game with a mediocre receiver that 's what happens			2
' firing back : @entity6 responded to @entity2 's rant on @entity73 @entity2 also attempted to defend himself on social media @entity2 remained unruffled after @entity6 's twitter response to his fiery rant it was a fiery , emotional rant from @entity2 , who celebrated his first conference title by racing around the field after @entity54 took the final knee , then leaping into the first row of seats in the south end zone to celebrate with fans			1
' i know how passionate he is about the game of football			0
he said to me before the game it 's going to come down to us making big plays			0
we 've got to do it			0
somehow we 've got to find a way to make big plays , ' teammate @entity111 said			0
' ( @entity2 ) has been doing it all season			0
he is arguably the best cornerback in the @entity115			0
they were trying to stay away from him the whole game			0
eventually they were going to have to go his way and eventually they did and they made a mistake			0
' @entity2 's play capped a fourth - quarter of big plays from @entity14 's defense			1
the @entity126 forced three turnovers in the final quarter , including a sack and forced fumble by @entity131 that was recovered by @entity132 , and @entity134 's interception of @entity17 's pass with 7:37 left			2
while @entity14 failed to capitalize on the fumble , they were able to turn chancellor 's interception into @entity140 's field goal that gave @entity14 a six - point lead with 3:37 left			2
' that 's the way we 've played the whole season , man			0
these guys are relentless , ' @entity132 said			0
' all we do is practice turnovers on defense and we just wanted to be in that situation , where the game was on our back because we were like , ' hey , if we 're going to win this game , then it 's time to win it			0
' game changer : @entity6 was thwarted by @entity2 's brilliance on the field			1

after @entity14 beat the 49ers 23 - 17 in the *nfc* championship game , @entity126 cornerback @entity2 *lambasted* receiver @entity6
' do n't you open your mouth about the best or i 'm gon na shut it for you real quick ! ' , he warned @entity6
@entity72 's @entity71 looked stunned and *quickly* handed back to the studio
