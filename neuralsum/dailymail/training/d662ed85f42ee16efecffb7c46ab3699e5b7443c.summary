i started to feel a pain in my chest			1
’ initially putting her discomfort down to her late stage of pregnancy , miss @entity4 , of @entity51 , @entity52 , was prescribed painkillers by her gp			1

i could n’t believe i ’d had a heart attack			1
it did n’t seem real			0
i ’d never had any symptoms previously			0

’ miss @entity4 was told she would need to have a planned c - section for fear her heart would n't be able to cope with a natural birth			1
however , she went into labour before the operation and @entity18 was born naturally miss @entity4 says she was terrified of leaving her daughter without a mother and of something happening to her unborn baby			2

but as she lay resting at home on july 20 , 2013 , awaiting her planned @entity117 on july 24 , miss @entity4 felt the onset of labour			2
she said : ‘ i was extremely scared			0
i did n’t know how i would cope with giving birth naturally			0
i ’d been quite panicky during @entity36 ’s birth , so i had those memories at the top of my mind , and i prayed that i would n’t suffer another attack			2
’ @entity29 was delivered by midwives as a team of doctors and nurses observed his mother ’s status on a heart monitor			2
fortunately @entity7 was not injured when he ran into the road because the cars braked in time to avoid him miss @entity4 and @entity18 are now healthy but she is being carefully monitored he was born underweight at 4lb 8oz but today @entity29 is a healthy , happy 10 - month - old baby			1
miss @entity4 , now 23 , said : ‘ i was so relieved to hold him for the first time and @entity104 was very proud too			2
‘ @entity29 is growing up very nicely and is an absolute angel			0
i ’ve had to be careful not to push things too much , but @entity36 has been a star by helping me with him			0
‘ the medical staff at the hospital now want to include my case in a medical journal , because there ’s rarely been an example of someone so young experiencing such a serious heart attack and going on to have a problem - free natural labour			1

@entity4 was eight months pregnant when cat @entity7 ran into traffic
she saw cars have to slam on their brakes to avoid *hitting* her *pet*
soon afterwards , she started to experience chest pains and breathlessness
she was rushed to hospital and medics discovered she *'d* had a heart attack
had been caused by a blood clot ; these are more likely during pregnancy
