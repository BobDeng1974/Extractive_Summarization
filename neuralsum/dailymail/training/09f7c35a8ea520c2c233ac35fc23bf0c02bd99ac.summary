by @entity0 published : 04:21 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 11:42 est , 21 february 2013 police in @entity2 are pioneering a futuristic new crime - fighting system that lets them see surveillance camera images from anywhere in the city and creates an interactive data map revealing arrest figures , license plates and radiation levels - all at the click of a button			1
the @entity14 software , called ‘ the dashboard ’ , sends an alert to officers as soon as an emergency call is made and operates a giant video wall that allows cops to watch more than 3,000 cameras city - wide as crimes are unfolding			1
it has been in use for a year but could now be rolled out to other forces in a move that could make tens of millions of dollars for @entity27 , which gets a 30 per cent cut of any sales			1
officers in @entity53 's biggest police department have been using the system , which gives access to the department 's voluminous arrest records , telephone calls , more than 3,000 security cameras citywide , license plate readers and radiation detectors , for about a year			1
and the @entity27 could make tens of millions of dollars under an unprecedented marketing deal that allows @entity14 to sell the system to other law enforcement agencies and civilian companies around the world			1
the city will get a 30 per cent cut			2
surveillance : the system is able to give officers access to more than 3,000 security cameras citywide it is currently used only in @entity27 offices , mostly in the counterterrorism unit			1
eventually , the system could supply crime - fighting information in real time to officers on laptops in their squad cars and on mobile devices while they walk the beat			1
@entity83 , director of planning and policy for the counterterrorism unit , said : ' it works incredibly well			2
' in august , officers used the system during a deadly shooting outside the @entity90			1
dozens of emergency telephone calls were coming in , and it initially looked like an attack staged by several gunmen			2
but officers mapped the information and pulled up cameras within 500 feet of the reported shots to determine there was only one shooter			2
at about 9am on friday , august 24 , disgruntled employee @entity101 hid behind a car and then pulled out a .45 - caliber pistol on his ex-boss @entity104 and fired at his head			0
after @entity104 fell to the ground , @entity101 stood over him and shot four more times , a witness told investigators			0
the incident sparked early - morning chaos and multiple other injuries near the @entity90			0
@entity101 was scuppered in his plans to escape after a construction worker saw the killing , chased him down the street and alerted police , who shot the gunman dead			0
in the rush - hour ruckus , nine passersby were injured			0
two people - the gunman and his former boss - were killed			0
investigation : police lean over a sheet covered body on @entity129 as they investigate a multiple shooting outside the @entity90 , on friday , august 24 killer : @entity101 , 59 , who gunned down his former boss @entity124 in @entity132 , @entity2 analysts are cautious about the potential profits , saying that largely depends on @entity14 's sales efforts and whether any major competition arises			2
while there other data - drilling products made by other companies , they say the @entity27 's involvement could set the dashboard apart			1
' this is the kind of stuff you used to only see in movies , ' analyst @entity142 of @entity143 , a technology analysis firm , said			0
' getting it to work in a way that police departments can use in real time is huge			0
' the venture began in 2009 when the @entity27 approached @entity14 about building software to help mine data for the @entity155 , a network of private and public cameras and other tools monitored by the department 's counter-terrorism bureau			1
development cost the department between $ 30 million and $ 40 million , officials said			0
' usually , you purchase software that you try to work with , but we wanted this to be something that really worked well for us , so we set about creating it with them , ' said @entity170 , the @entity27 's deputy commissioner for counter-terrorism			2
officers were involved throughout the process with the programmers , offering advice on what they need during an emergency			2
' it was created by cops for cops , ' @entity83 said			0
' we thought a lot about what information we want up close and personal , and what needs to be a click away			0
it 's all baked in there			0
' @entity187 , a @entity14 vice president in charge of program management , said the company started to market the system in august and is looking at smaller municipalities , law enforcement agencies and companies that handle major sporting events			1
no firm timetable has been set on when the dashboard will be rolled out to the entire 34,000 - offficer department			0
development : the venture began in 2009 when the @entity27 approached @entity14 about building software to help mine data for the @entity155 video : @entity14 and @entity27 develop ' matrix - style ' crime - fighting system			1

@entity40 developed between @entity27 and @entity14
system instantly provides officers with stacks of public data
@entity27 could also make money under unprecedented marketing deal
