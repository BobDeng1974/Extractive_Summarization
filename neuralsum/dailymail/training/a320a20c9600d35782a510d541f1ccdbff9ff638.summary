physicist @entity0 is currently serving time in @entity1 after being found guilty of smuggling cocaine into the country a brilliant physicist currently languishing under house arrest in @entity6 after being found guilty of smuggling two kilos of cocaine into the country has admitted his large ego played a key role in his tragic fall from grace			1
@entity0 , a distinguished professor of physics and astronomy , has spent most of the past 30 years as a professor at the @entity16			1
but @entity18 - born @entity0 ’s life took a unexpected turn in november 2011 when he started an online relationship with someone he thought was @entity22 , a @entity24 model and former @entity25			1
after meeting via an online dating site and despite never having ever spoken to her , @entity0 , 68 , became convinced that they would marry and start a family			1
the unlikely scenario of a glamorous model falling for an aging academic clearly has all the hallmarks of a honey trap , but to a lonely old man who had got divorced three years earlier the relationship seemed very real to @entity0			1
academic friends warned @entity0 about what he was getting into , but as the professor himself admits he rarely pays attention to the opinions of others			1
‘ he told me to look her up on the internet , ’ his old friend @entity43 told @entity44			0
‘ i thought he was out of his mind , and i told him that			0
" you ’re not talking to the real girl			0
why would a young woman like that be interested in an old guy like you ? ” but he really believed that he had a pretty young woman who wanted to marry him			0
’ when the @entity44 asked @entity0 what made him think that @entity22 was interested , he replied , ‘ well , i have been accused of having a huge ego			1
’ friends say @entity0 was extremely inexperienced with women and could therefore have been easily duped by whoever was posing as @entity22			1
he was already 50 when he married his wife @entity60			0
the pair divorced in 2008 and remain friends , she has described him as a very good scientist , but with the emotional age of a 3 - year - old			0
stolen identity : @entity22 , 36 , is a @entity24 model and former miss @entity25 as @entity0 's online relationship with @entity22 blossomed , she invited him to finally meet her in @entity70 , @entity71 , where she was doing a photo shoot			1
when @entity0 arrived in @entity70 he was greeted with a message that his supposed girlfriend had had to leave for another photo shoot in @entity76 , but she promised to send him a ticket			1
the couple keep regular online contact and eventually a ticket arrived to take him to @entity6 , with the promise that a ticket to @entity76 would follow			0
@entity22 simply asked one favor of @entity0 – that he bring her bag which she had mistakenly left in @entity70			1
despite the mounting evidence that he was being set up as the victim of some scam , @entity0 agreed to her request and once again refused to listen to the advice of his friends			1
while still in @entity71 , @entity0 exchanged messages with his old friend @entity43			1
@entity0 was already 50 when he married his ex-wife @entity94 , she has described him as a very good scientist , but with the emotional age of a 3 - year - old ‘ i said : “ well , inside that suitcase sewn into the lining will be cocaine			1
you ’re in big trouble , ” said @entity43 recalling their conversation			0
nine days after he arrived in @entity71 , @entity0 met with a man who handed over @entity22 ’s bag			1
@entity0 had been expecting a designer label and was so surprised by the non-descript black suitcase with wheels he was handed instead			1
he was even more surprised to find that it was also empty			0
he wrote to @entity22 , but she quickly wrote back that it had great ‘ sentimental value ’ to her			1
the next day @entity0 flew from @entity70 to @entity6 , where he waited for another two days for his ticket to @entity114 to arrive			2
with no sign of a ticket to @entity114 and after being away from home for 15 days , @entity0 decided it was time to return to @entity119			2
but rather than leave the bag behind , he decided to take it with him			0
that way , he reasoned , @entity22 could come and collect it from him			2
then just as his friends had warned , @entity0 was arrested when he checked the bag in at the airport and he was charged with transporting two kilos of cocaine into the country			1
@entity0 spent almost a year at the @entity131 prison sharing a large room with 40 other men accused of drug - related offenses the professor was taken to @entity131 , a dilapidated old prison where he was forced to share one large room with 80 other men accused of drug dealing or smuggling			1
@entity0 admits it was a month into his prison stay before his fellow prisoners managed to convince him that the woman he thought he ’d been in touch with all this time had probably been a man impersonating her			1
throughout his 282 day stay in the prison , @entity0 maintained that he was the victim of a scam			2
three weeks before his trial and with the help of privately hired lawyers , @entity0 was able to quickly secure his release on the proviso that he remained under house arrest at the @entity6 home of his friend @entity159			2
at the trial the strategy of his defense team was to present @entity0 as a brilliant man out of touch with day - to - day life			2
they claimed he suffered from ' a schizoid personality disorder that prevents him from making normal social connections and renders him unusually gullible			0
' they called in a psychologist , who pronounced him unusually gullible without , however , diagnosing a mental illness			0
the judges sent their own doctor , who declared @entity0 normal			2
@entity0 was arrested at @entity175 in @entity6 a total of three psychological evaluations were presented at the trial , and two agreed that he had the traits of a narcissistic personality - an overblown and unrealistic image of himself			2
prior to the trial @entity0 had maintained that his text message exchanges with the person he thought was @entity22 would prove his innocence beyond a shadow of a doubt			1
but that defense quickly unraveled			0
the prosecutor opened his cross-examination of @entity0 by citing a text message retrieved from @entity0 ’s confiscated cellphone			2
‘ on jan. 22 at 9:46 a.m. , ’ he said , ‘ you wrote from @entity175 to the person you understood to be @entity22 : “ was worried only about sniffer dogs but more			2
’ ” other text exchanges also seemed to show @entity0 had known more than he been letting on			2
one at 9:52 a.m. read : ‘ need to know if your loyalty is with the bad guy - agent & bolivian friends - or good guy , your husband ? ’ at 12:16 p.m. , he wrote : ' why are you ignoring me ? at this last moment			0
we did not decide how to meet tomorrow in brussels and @entity207			0
@entity208 ( the hotel in @entity76 where they were due to meet ) we may lose both ! ! ' @entity22 had her identity stolen and used as the honey trap for @entity0 @entity0 tried to explain to the judges that these messages – some 30 of them - were actually jokes			1
but perhaps they were the work of a fantasist living out a supposed alternative reality with a girlfriend who by ow even he by must have questioned the existence off ? even more oddly , his defense showed @entity224 footage which showed @entity0 getting up from a cafe table and wandering off , leaving his bags unattended for up to 25 minutes at a time			2
hardly the behavior of a drug smuggler			0
the prosecution then produced a piece of paper on which @entity0 had written : ‘ 1 gram 200 dollars 2,000 grams 400,000 dollars			2
’ although his defense claimed this had been written after he was arrested and @entity0 simply enjoyed making random calculations			0
@entity0 said : ' my mind works in a strange way			0
' @entity0 has spent most of the past 30 years as a professor at the @entity16 ultimately the judges sentenced him to four years eights months for drug smuggling on nov. 19 , although he is permitted to serve the remainder of sentence under house arrest in @entity6			1
with credit for the time he has already spent in custody , @entity0 is expected to be released in may 2014			0
@entity0 maintains his innocence , but the truth of this bizarre set of circumstances may never be fully explained			0
the real @entity22 was never accused of having a role in the drug smuggling and has no connection to @entity0			1
she told the @entity254 that she feels sorry for @entity0			0
' i have a lot of sympathy for him , though i have to wonder how he could have been so naive , ' she said			0
he too says he has sympathy for her , but @entity0 also has his own worries , in particular related to his finances			0
his university have kept his position open awaiting the outcome of an appeal he has launched			0
in the meantime he is n't being paid and friends have setup a website to help raise money for him and publicize his unusual experience .			0
