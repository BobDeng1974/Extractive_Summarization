by @entity0 it 's barely 150 years since @entity2 was a bustling city of immigrants from across the world			2
but it seems that the skyline that once greeted visitors is virtually unrecognisable from the same scene in 1876			2
@entity9 is the iconic @entity10 which was just being built to connect two districts of the @entity12			2
the changes are shown in a startling composite picture of the skyline over the decades , starting with 1876 , going into 1932 and 1988 and finishing in 2013			1
the @entity2 skyline before @entity10 was completed and the other side of @entity18 can be seen in the distance ( picture from @entity21 ) in 56 years high - rise buildings have already made a significant change on the skyline and the opposite side of @entity18 can no longer be seen ( picture from @entity21 ) the first grainy black and white image , published online by @entity27 , shows the bustling city with ships lining the dock yards in @entity31			1
construction of @entity10 - then the world 's biggest suspension bridge - had only just begun and only the towers on the @entity31 side of @entity2 were in place			2
the tallest building in the city appears to be a church spire close to @entity41			0
but with the industrial revolution bringing great wealth to the city it was soon to be transformed			0
over the next 60 years dozens of imposing building shot up across @entity2 - including the @entity47 which was the tallest in the world when it was built on @entity49 in 1931			0
just behind the @entity47 is the @entity50 , which was built on the @entity51 in 1930			0
by now the @entity10 had been completed and a second crossing , the @entity53 , had been finished a short distance away			0
despite the @entity55 ravaging many of the city 's residents throughout the 1930s , @entity2 soon recovered			0
the scene in the next image taken in 1988 shows how the city had been transformed from a hub of industry to the financial capital of the @entity66 the boom of the 80s shows a @entity2 skyline that is much more recognisable to today 's residents and visitors ( picture from @entity21 ) the future : from next year this is how we can expect to see the @entity2 skyline with the @entity77 in place of the @entity79 ( picture from @entity21 ) gone are the ship yards once full of dockers and trawlers and in their place are are clean - cut avenues lined with restaurants and cafes			1
more skyscrapers have been built , and the buildings in the financial district and down to @entity90 now tower along the bay like fortresses			1
most noticeable though are the twin towers of the @entity79 now dwarfing the other buildings in the city			0
a brief look at the latest picture from 2013 shows a gap where they once stood			1
in its place is @entity77 , commemorating the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks			1
despite a quarter of a century passing between 1988 and 2013 , the structural changes to the city 's skylines are not as dramatic as in earlier years			1
a handful of new towers have been built and more buildings have appeared to in the right hand corner of the latest image , stretching further north in @entity31 .			0

*dockyards* from the early 1900s are gone as financial district gives rise to skyscrapers
@entity119 visible in 1988 *replaced* by @entity77 in 2013 for 9/11 victims
