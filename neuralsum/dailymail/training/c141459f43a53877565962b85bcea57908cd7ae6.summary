it has been almost a year of anxious speculation			1
but when the moment came for a ' major character ' on @entity5 to be killed off , viewers were less than impressed			1
it was @entity8 's father , rabbi @entity7			2
one @entity21 user raged : ' @entity8 's dad ... lame worst episode ever ! lol ' another said : ' i was more upset when @entity26 died			2
and he was only on one episode			0
' and one simply remarked : ' that death was not a main character			2
' creators have spent 11 months giving tantalizingly cryptic interviews regarding the victim that would be axed in much - hyped episode			1
in april , executive producer @entity34 told reporters the actor who plays the character has won an emmy award for his @entity5 work - but that applies to numerous actors , including all six members of the main cast : @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , and @entity49			1
last week he refused to confirm or deny any of the suggested victims , saying : ' some people have guessed it correctly , and some are really , really off			0
' when a reporter asked him if religion plays a part in the death , he simply replied ' yes '			0
@entity34 admits that he decided to make the episode a mysterious secret on a whim while speaking to journalists last fall			1
and he also revealed it is ' likely ' rabbi @entity7 will return to the show in @entity8 's dreams			1
he told @entity66 : ' i thought it would be a little sneaky to say that the character had won an @entity17 and the next thing i knew it was a huge , worldwide story			2
defense : executive producer @entity34 said the rabbi is beloved but he did say the episode was over-hyped ' so from that point on , we tried to tease it as best as possible but as you can see , there ’s really about three clues you can give			1
' @entity34 even claims the episode title , @entity83 was made deliberately easy in order to play down the hype			1
he said : ' then there were people going , “ you ’re killing @entity8 ? ? ? ” and i was like , “ what ? in the dumps does n’t mean you ’re dead			0
it means you ’re sad			0
” ' i thought it was so obvious			0
i would be nuts to kill @entity8			0
' rebuffing fans ' disappointment , he said , ' i never said it ’s an iconic character			1
i never used those words , ' adding : ' he is beloved			0
' if you look back at the clues we gave , everything adds up , so i would find that satisfying			0
i would n’t feel like i was misled			0

executive producer @entity34 revealed last year a lead character will die
fans have been *analyzing* cryptic clues by show 's *writers* for months
