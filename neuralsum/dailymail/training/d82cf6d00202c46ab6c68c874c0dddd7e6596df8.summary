hotter summers , melting icecaps and intense rainfall are just a few of the effects of global warming			0
and now scientists claim we can add animal dwarfism to that list			0
@entity11 researchers have found that mammals shrank significantly during at least two ancient global warming events			0
the finding suggests a similar outcome is possible in response to future climate change			0

this image shows an artist 's rendering of the early horse @entity21 ( right ) alongside a modern - day horse scientists have known for years that animals such as horses and deer became much smaller during a period of warming , called the @entity30 ( @entity30 )			1
this occurred around 55 million years ago when global temperatures rose by about 6 ° c over a period of 200,000 years			1
now @entity36 palaeontologist @entity35 have found evidence that mammalian ‘ dwarfing ’ also occurred during a separate , smaller global warming event 53 million years ago			1
@entity40 fossil of the early horse @entity21 , collected in the @entity43 region of @entity44			2
researchers found that @entity21 body size decreased 19 per cent during a global warming event about 53 million years ago the work at @entity36 follows a study at the @entity50 and @entity51 which claims global warming could make us shorter			1
palaeontologists studying fossilised horses found a direct link between the size of mammals and the planet 's temperature - with warmer times meaning smaller beasts			1
as temperatures went up their size went down , and vice versa , said dr @entity66 , curator of the @entity67			2
at one point they were as small as a house cat , he said			0
the researchers say that the current warming could have the same effect on mammals - and may even make humans smaller			0
‘ the fact that it happened twice significantly increases our confidence that we 're seeing cause and effect , that one interesting response to global warming in the past was a substantial decrease in body size in mammalian species , ’ said dr @entity35 , a professor of earth and environmental sciences			1
scientists believe a shrinking body size is a common evolutionary response by mammals to extreme global warming events , known as hyperthermals			2
they claim this may be ‘ a predictable natural response for some lineages to future global warming			0
’ the smaller , later warming event analysed in the latest study , known as @entity99 ( @entity99 ) , lasted 80,000 to 100,000 years			0
teeth and jaw fossils of early hoofed mammals and primates that spanned this later climatic event were collected in @entity44 's @entity43 , and the size of molar teeth was used as a proxy for body size			1
the researchers found that body size decreased during the later warming period , but not as much as the dwarfism seen in fossils for the earlier warming event			2
for example , the study revealed that a lineage of early horses the size of a small dog , called @entity21 , experienced a body - size decrease of about 19 per cent during @entity99			1
the same horse lineage showed a body - size decrease of about 30 per cent during the @entity30			1
the researchers found that body size decreased during the later warming period , but not as much as the dwarfism seen in fossils for the earlier warming event after both events , the animals rebounded to their pre-warming size			2
‘ interestingly , the extent of mammalian dwarfism may be related to the magnitude of the hyperthermal event , ’ said team member @entity129 of the @entity130			0
the ancient warming events may have been caused by the release of seabed methane clathrates , a kind of methane ice found in ocean sediments , though this topic remains an area of active research , dr @entity35 said			0
the parallels between ancient hyperthermals and modern - day warming make studies of the fossil record particularly valuable , said team member @entity149 of the @entity130			0
‘ developing a better understanding of the relationship between mammalian body size change and greenhouse gas - induced global warming during the geological past may help us predict ecological changes that may occur in response to current changes in @entity161 's climate , ’ said mr @entity149 .			1

early horses shrunk by 19 **%** during warm period 53 million years ago
the same horse lineage showed a body - size decrease of about 30 **%** during a warmer period in the @entity161 's *history* 55 million years ago
