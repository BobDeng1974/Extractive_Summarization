a new way of diagnosing glaucoma which involves patients watching episodes of @entity4 has been developed by scientists			1
by scanning and analysing their eye movements , researchers at @entity7 were able to identify cases of the common eye disease , with almost 80 per cent accuracy			1
the irreversible condition is caused by progressive damage to the optic nerve , and leads to a loss of peripheral vision and eventual blindness			2
scientists have developed a new test to detect glaucoma , by scanning and analysing eye movements as a person watches tv			1
while studying glaucoma patients and healthy individuals , they used clips from @entity4 around the world it is thought to affect 65 million people , but many remain undiagnosed			1
scientists hope the eye movement test will in future allow clinicians to spot cases earlier , allowing treatment to begin while there is still time to save a patient 's sight			1
in a study involving 44 elderly glaucoma patients and 32 healthy individuals , the system identified 79 per cent of those who had the disease			1
the rate of false diagnoses of healthy individuals was one in 10			2
lead scientist professor @entity48 , from @entity7 , said : ' these are early results but we 've found we can identify patients with glaucoma by monitoring how people watch tv			1
' this could make a huge difference in detecting or monitoring a disease which currently results in one in 10 of all blindness registrations in the @entity59 and about a million @entity61 appointments a year for those with the disease			2
a complete eye examination includes five common tests to detect glaucoma			1
it is important people have their eyes tested regularly			0
before the age of 40 it is recommended people have a test every two years			1
from 40 to 54 that should increase to every one to three years			0
between the ages of 55 to 64 a test should be performed every two years and after the age of 65 , this should be every year			1
the five tests measure : ' once the damage is done it can not be reversed , so early diagnosis is vital for identifying a disease which will continue to get more prevalent as our population ages			0
' the study participants , who had an average age of 69 , were asked to watch tv and film clips on a computer			2
professor @entity48 said the clips included episodes of an old favourite , @entity4			1
at the same time , their eye movements were tracked and the information fed into a computer			0
the software plotted the saccade patterns - fast movements of the eye - on to a grid and was able to spot subtle differences between them			0
certain patterns , only clearly discernible by the computer , correlated with having glaucoma			2
' what we 've done is use a mathematical technique to find patterns in these grids that allow us to distinguish between the groups , ' said professor @entity48			0
' if you look very closely there are features that are slightly different , but you need a computer to recognise them			0
' the eye movements are very fast , quicker than heartbeats			0
' the research stemmed from a theory linking eye movement patterns with loss of peripheral vision			0
current tests for gluacoma involve five different steps , carried out during regular eye examinations professor @entity48 said : ' someone with moderate glaucoma would have a piece of their field of view that is missing			2
' their brain has to continually move their eyes around to fill in the gaps			0
we believe the eye movements compensate for the missing information			0
' he added that a variant of the same technique might be able to diagnose other eye diseases , such as macular degeneration , which is marked by the loss of central vision			0
neurodegenerative diseases such as @entity148 's and @entity149 's were also thought to affect eye movements			0
dr @entity151 , director of research at the charity @entity153 , which funded the study , said : ' one of @entity153 's six long - term goals is to enable conditions such as glaucoma to be detected earlier			2
' early diagnosis and treatment can stop people losing their sight , so we 're very pleased that this proof - of - principle eye movement study opens the door to developing a new clinical test for glaucoma			1
