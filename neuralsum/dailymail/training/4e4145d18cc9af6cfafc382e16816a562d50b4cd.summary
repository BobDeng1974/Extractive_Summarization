one year ago to this very day , @entity0 lay in a hospital bed with an intravenous drip connected to his arm			1
he was so heavily sedated following surgery that he could barely open his eyes to watch the television in front of him			0
on the screen , @entity8 were giving @entity10 a run for their money at @entity13			1
it was a fixture he had always dreamed of playing in			0
@entity0 ’s future as a footballer was hanging in the balance			1
the decision to undergo a series of operations had been taken in an attempt to finally quell the suffering caused by chronic ulcerative colitis			1
suffering that had severely disrupted three years of his career			2
as another @entity36 season prepares to dawn , the 30 - year - old is getting used to his new role as vice-captain of @entity31			1
talk of comebacks and courage is all too readily bandied around in the sporting world , but @entity0 ’s own recovery has been genuinely remarkable			1
forget any notion that his appointment as @entity32 ’s back - up is rooted in sentiment			0
that is hardly @entity51 ’s style			1
rather , this is a case of @entity0 proving through his unstinting efforts over pre-season that he has a real future within the plans of the @entity58 taskmaster			1
@entity0 scored in tuesday ’s 2 - 1 friendly win over @entity60 before expressing sincere delight about his new status within the squad			1
‘ it ’s a very proud moment for me and my family , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity32 and i have always worked well together and will continue to work closely together in our new roles			0
i would like to thank the manager for putting his trust in me			0
’ guess who 's back ! @entity0 celebrates scoring against @entity60 in @entity31 's last pre-season game @entity72 to lead @entity31 that is the key issue here			1
@entity74 has clearly liked what he has seen from @entity0 in terms of performance and personality			1
‘ a natural leader , ’ was the 63 - year - old ’s assessment			0
those who have followed @entity0 ’s struggles are almost as thrilled as the man himself about this confirmation of his continued worth to one of the world ’s biggest clubs			1
former @entity31 favourite @entity88 has been close to the situation via his work for the in - house television station			1
‘ getting back in and around the @entity31 first team is the real prize for @entity0 , ’ insisted @entity88			1
‘ because at one stage that looked a long shot			0
‘ being the type of character he is , he has battled his way through it			0
he is now back playing and will be delighted to be vice-captain			0
that , though , is not the priority			0
the priority was to get back and into contention for the first team			0
‘ @entity107 does n’t wait for you when you are out for that length of time			0
other people come along and try to take your place			0
it is a real struggle to get back into the team but @entity0 has met it head - on			1
comeback kid : @entity0 acknowledges the @entity31 fans after returning to the team last season @entity31 : @entity0 teamed up with ex-rugby star @entity119 to raise awareness about his condition ‘ the new manager clearly believes there is still a good , long future for him			1
everyone was under pressure when @entity51 came in			2
‘ but @entity0 was perhaps under more pressure because he knew he had lost a year or more from football			2
‘ when he returned at the back end of last year , he was alright but he was n’t the @entity0 we knew before			1
‘ gradually , though , with a bit more fitness under his belt he has restored that ability to get around the pitch			0
‘ i counted the other day that there are 13 or 14 players looking to get into @entity31 ’s midfield			2
that is some competition , but he has come through and got a place at the start of the season			0
’ as you might suspect , @entity88 has boundless admiration for the relentless determination @entity0 has shown over the past few years			1
flying high : @entity0 was a regular member of the @entity31 team under former manager @entity151 @entity58 of class : new manager @entity51 has impressed with the @entity153 since taking over ‘ unless you have that illness then i do n’t think you can appreciate the impact of it			1
it ’s not a broken leg or a hamstring tear , this almost brought @entity0 ’s life to a standstill			2
‘ but he fought back with everything he had and anything he gets from here on is thoroughly deserved			0
‘ a lot of players might not even have considered trying to fight back			0
at @entity0 ’s age , it ’s fair to say these guys are well and truly financially secure			2
‘ it is all credit to him that he wanted so badly to get back on the pitch			0
not to earn a new contract or more money – but to play football at the top level			0
‘ other players might not have been able to handle what @entity0 has been through and called it a day			2
there was no chance of that with @entity0			2
’ the role as one of @entity51 ’s dressing room lieutenants should come easily to @entity0			1
a @entity31 man to his core , he could be a valuable sounding board for the @entity58 as he seeks to revive the club following the turmoil of @entity193 ’ brief and ill - fated reign			2
‘ @entity0 has been at the club with sir @entity151 ( @entity151 ) for such a long time and knows what is expected , ’ said @entity88			1
‘ we are not just talking about performances on the pitch but about conducting yourself in the right way			0
about being a true professional			0
‘ that background has been so important to @entity0			2
without his way of thinking , this comeback may not have happened			2
’ @entity0 ’s continued progress is also a significant boon to @entity209 as @entity8 prepare to begin their @entity211 qualifying campaign against world champions @entity214 in @entity215 next month			1
@entity216 : the midfielder warms up in @entity218 ahead of his first game for @entity8 under @entity209 spot on : @entity0 takes a penalty for @entity8 in a @entity222 quualifying game against @entity223 in 2011 the midfielder made his first appearance under @entity209 as a second - half substitute during the 1 - 0 friendly win over @entity228 in march			1
now , though , it seems the national side may be able to call upon a player who has moved far closer to his previous capabilities			0
‘ without a doubt , having a fit and on - form @entity0 would be a huge boost for @entity8 , ’ insisted @entity88			1
‘ without being disrespectful to anyone else , we do n’t have a large number of top players in @entity0 ’s mould			2
he has proved himself over the years			0
‘ hopefully , he can keep progressing and play a real part for the national team in this next campaign			0
a @entity8 with @entity0 is certainly better than one without him			1
