total @entity3 sales have fallen by 6.2 per cent in the last two years , which means the nation is eating some 423million fewer sausages a year			1
the industry puts the fall down to the rise in the cost of pork , which is now at an historic high , taking the cost of a pack of sausages up by some 12.5per cent in a year			1
sales of sausages have fallen in the @entity3 by 6.2 per cent in the last two years , which means the nation is eating some 423million fewer sausages a year some value packs of sausages have risen even more steeply at the big supermarket chains			1
for example , a pack of eight @entity24 's @entity3 @entity23 is up from £ 1 to £ 1.40 over the past nine months			0
however , other factors such as renewed health concerns about the impact of eating red meat may also have led some families to cut back			1
the slow decline of sausage sales comes as families and children increasingly switch to imported fast food options such as pizza , pasta and curry			1
the pork sausage is a particularly @entity3 delicacy , however it has had its critics over the years given concerns over the rather grim ingredients and gristle that have been used in some products			1
the industry has responded to this by producing a raft of new gourmet versions flavoured with herbs and fruit			1
the problems of sausage sales have been revealed by @entity54 , the @entity55 maker of the collagen skins that are used as cases for sausages , chipolatas , salamis , and bratwurst			1
shoppers have increasingly turned either to the lowest - cost brands from budget chains , or to top - end ' black tray ' sausages that are encased in traditional animal gut chief executive , @entity68 , said @entity3 have particularly lost the taste for mid-market brands such as supermarket own label creations , where sales were down 7per cent in the past two years			1
nearly three - quarters of @entity3 households still buy sausages , according to research for the industry group , @entity76 , and @entity77			2
however , shoppers have increasingly turned either to the lowest - cost brands from budget chains , or to top - end ' black tray ' sausages that are encased in traditional animal gut			2
sales through the likes of @entity84 and @entity85 , where prices for sausages appear at least 10per cent cheaper , are up by around 24per cent in two years			2
shares in @entity54 – which makes enough casing to stretch several times around the world – fell by 9 per cent on tuesday , after the company said demand for sausages had been subdued			1
but while the @entity3 may be cutting back on sausages , the picture is very different in @entity97 where pork consumption is growing rapidly among the burgeoning middle class			2
@entity54 is spending £ 50m constructing a plant in @entity97 which will start production in 2016 amid expectations that the country will make up half of global sausage consumption within a few years			1
it is believed that the sausage was first brought to these shores by the @entity109 around @entity110			2
the word derives from the @entity112 , meaning something that has been salted			0
according to the @entity116 , the first specific reference in @entity115 came in a fifteenth century vocabulary publication , which described the ' sawsage '			0
