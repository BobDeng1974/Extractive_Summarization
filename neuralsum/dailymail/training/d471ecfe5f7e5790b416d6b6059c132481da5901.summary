@entity0 will go head - to - head with @entity2 at a press conference on wednesday ahead of a fight on january 31 that will be @entity5 ’s biggest test so far			1
@entity6 is on the horizon for next summer , but @entity5 faces a big challenge here			1
it ’s been outstanding to watch him destroy all his opponents so far			0
we all knew he was good but no - one quite expected him to be so devastating that after 10 fights he would n’t have reached the fourth round			2
this is a guy who has never been stopped in 36 fights – he is seriously durable			0
he has been in with @entity27 , @entity6 and @entity28 – none of them could stop him			1
he also has a bit of a mouth on him and is a great character , which will be a new challenge for @entity5			0
he will be called all sorts in the build - up and it will be interesting to see how @entity5 handles the hype			2
personally , i expect @entity0 to stop him inside the distance and do what other big heavyweights failed to do			1
it ’s amazing that within 10 fights @entity5 is already the most popular heavyweight in the country			2
we have already sold 6,000 tickets for his fight at the @entity50 and the fight is nine weeks away			2
@entity2 has never been stopped in his 36 fights , including this one against @entity27 ( right ) @entity53 's @entity28 ( right ) could n't stop the incredibly durable @entity54 either we are moving towards the inevitable , which is a fight with @entity6 and the other top domestic fighters			1
it 's going to be great times for @entity60 boxing			0
i watched the main event from the show at the excel at the weekend and i have to say @entity65 was one of the dullest heavyweight fights i have seen			1
with the fight starting well past midnight and many missing their transportation home , boos rang out after only a few rounds as the crowds started to disperse			2
@entity6 is a great character and a quality fighter but do you really see him coping with @entity0 ’s power , speed and work rate ? do you not think @entity0 would have blasted @entity28 out of there far earlier ? people ask if @entity5 is ready to fight @entity6 but , to be honest , is @entity6 ready to fight @entity5 ? i believe this is a fight that will bring both men to new levels in terms of financial rewards			1
it 's a numbers game and these numbers add up			0
a heavyweight clash between @entity5 and heavyweight title contender @entity6 may happen in 2015 @entity6 and @entity28 's fight at @entity92 's @entity91 was one of the dullest heavyweight fights i have seen while @entity28 did n't come out for the 11th round , @entity5 would have got him out of the ring earlier i ’m currently planning the next move for @entity97 after he got his revenge over @entity99			1
we all expected fireworks and unfortunately the main event just did n’t live up to it			0
but @entity97 did what he had to do and now has a great future in front of him – i ’m in talks with both @entity108 and @entity109 about cruiserweight world - title fights with @entity97			1
the rest of the division know that he sells			0
the numbers from the weekend were very good and that makes him commercially attractive to all of them			0
cruiserweight world title fights against @entity108 or @entity109 could be on the cards for @entity97 the next move for @entity97 is being planned after he did what he had to do to beat @entity99 ( left ) at the moment , it looks like his next fight will be for a world title in the spring			1
we are already in discussions with @entity108 , the @entity128 champion from @entity129 , and i can reveal we are also talking to @entity109 , the @entity130 who has the @entity132 belt			1
we have seen the city of @entity134 get behind @entity97 and i am in talks about putting on a fight for him at @entity138			1
the question is whether we could get one of the world champions to fight over here			2
from that point of view , @entity109 seems more willing to travel , so we ’ll wait and see how it pans out in the next few weeks			2
i can reveal here that i am close to securing a world title rematch for @entity147 against @entity148			1
hopefully it will all be finalised in the next few days			0
@entity147 lost a hugely contentious points decision in the first fight in september and now he will likely have his second chance in @entity153 on february 21			1
a @entity147 - @entity148 rematch is likely to be confirmed for february 21 in the next few days the fight that shifted the tickets on saturday was @entity157 versus @entity158			1
the fight was close and competitive but technically it was poor , with @entity157 winning by a couple of rounds			0
when your dad is telling everyone that you ’d beat @entity166 and that you ’re the best since @entity167 , you are already in a no - win situation			0
@entity157 celebrates his points victory over @entity170 at the @entity91 on saturday the @entity157 ( right ) and @entity158 bout was close and competitive but technically it was poor those claims have put @entity158 in an awkward position as , to be honest , he looked like a talented novice			1
in the ring it was a bit strange			0
when he really needed direction from his corner , there was none			0
i thought he could have been better served because clearly he is a talented fighter			0
if he started quicker and put more pressure on from the early rounds , i think he would have got the win			0
@entity157 will now go on to fight for world honours , but you have to respect @entity158 – he took a huge risk for short money			2
forgetting the noise around him , he is a talented fighter and i 'm sure he will come again			0
when your dad is telling everyone you ’re the best since @entity167 , you are in a no - win situation @entity158 throws a big right , which @entity157 manages to evade , in his defeat but he will come again i flew to @entity197 last week to speak to @entity198 about making a number of huge fights and also about staging fights in the @entity54			1
the talks were extremely productive and i should have some exciting news on that front soon			0
the always popular @entity206 series returns to @entity207 this saturday and you can expect fireworks from this exciting line up			0
eight lightweights battle it out for the £ 32,000 first prize - it 's a fascinating line up with experienced former domestic champs @entity215 and @entity217 the favourites - look out for the lively young @entity220 @entity219 who is all action ! also on the bill one of our top young fighters @entity222 takes on @entity226 in a super-featherweight eliminator			2
it 's a cracking little fight - we have high hopes for @entity222 and expect him to shine bright .			1

@entity2 will try to rile @entity0 at wednesday 's conference
i back *unbeaten* @entity0 to be the first man to stop the @entity54
@entity6 and @entity28 was the dullest heavyweight fight i *'ve* seen
talks have started to have @entity97 's world title fight versus @entity108 or @entity109 at @entity138
details nearly finalised for @entity147 - @entity148 feb 21 rematch
@entity244 looked like a talented novice but he *'ll* come again
