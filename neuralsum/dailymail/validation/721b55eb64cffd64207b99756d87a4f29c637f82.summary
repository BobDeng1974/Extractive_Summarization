the man behind the highly anticipated expose on @entity1 that is set to air this weekend on @entity3 is calling out the most high profile member of the church - actor @entity5			2
@entity6 said in a recent interview he does not understand why @entity5 has refused to comment on the numerous claims made against him and @entity1 over the years , going so far as to call his silence ' irresponsible			1
' among the claims featured in @entity6 's documentary , going @entity12 , are that @entity5 allegedly tapped the phone of his ex-wife @entity14 prior to their split and that he used underpaid workers for his own personal use that were supplied by the church			1
' we believe that he has a responsibility to say something about the abuse			0
' he then said of @entity44 ; ' he can espouse his beliefs , that 's fine			0
but not to address the allegations of abuse seems to me palpably irresponsible			0
' @entity50 , who goes by @entity51 , makes some explosive claims about @entity5 and current head of the church @entity55 in @entity6 's documentary			2
@entity50 , who was a top aide to @entity55 , claims that the church did not approve of @entity5 's relationship with @entity14 , and hoped they would break up once @entity5 began to drift away from the church during their marriage			2
then , while @entity5 was away with @entity14 in @entity59 working on the @entity61 film @entity60 , @entity50 claims the actor ordered the church to tap his wife 's phone			1
@entity50 says he was shocked by this demand , but did as he was told			0
@entity50 , who also claims he was beaten and abused by @entity66 , did not say what , if any , information was obtained through the tapping of @entity14 's phone , but the two did split just a few years later , at which time @entity5 became a highly vocal supporter of @entity1			1
there are also claims in the film that church workers being paid less than a dollar an hour are used by @entity5 to maintain his collection of motorcycles and his private plane			1
@entity50 ( left ) makes some explosive claims about @entity5 and current head of the church @entity55 ( right ) in @entity6 's documentary ' the accusations made in the film are entirely false and alleged without ever asking the @entity88 , ' said the @entity88 is a statement ' the accusations made in the film are entirely false and alleged without ever asking the @entity88 , ' said the @entity88 is a statement			1
neither @entity5 or @entity14 granted @entity6 an interview			0
the church also ran an ad in january - just after the documentary had its premiere at the @entity97 - which appeared in the @entity98 , saying ; ' @entity99 has documented evidence that those featured in @entity6 â€™s film regurgitating their stale , discredited allegations are admitted perjurers , admitted liars and professional anti-scientologists whose living depends on the filing of false claims			2
' all have been gone so long from the @entity88 they know nothing of it today			0
yet @entity6 and @entity3 stonewalled more than a dozen requests by the @entity88 to offer relevant information about them , with more than 25 individuals with firsthand information eager to speak			0
' to this day , neither @entity3 nor @entity6 can deny that they have yet to present the @entity88 with a single allegation from the film so the @entity88 may have an opportunity to respond			0
' the @entity88 never sought special treatment , only fair treatment			0
' @entity3 meanwhile had a reported 160 lawyers watch and vet the documentary , which airs at 8pm this sunday			1
lawyers for the @entity66 dispute the claims that their client was ever involved in the tapping of @entity14 's phone , that church workers are used by @entity5 to maintain his collection of motorcycles and his private plane and that @entity134 was ' beaten and abused ' by their client .			1

@entity6 , the director of the @entity1 documentary going @entity12 , blasted @entity5 after a screening of the film on monday
@entity6 called @entity5 ' irresponsible ' over his refusal to comment on the many claims made against him and @entity1 over the years

there are also claims that @entity5 used workers who were paid less than a dollar and hour by the church to maintain his motorcycles and plane
' the accusations made in the film are entirely false and alleged without ever asking the @entity88 , ' said the @entity88 is a statement
@entity3 meanwhile had a reported 160 lawyers watch and vet the documentary , which airs at 8pm this sunday
