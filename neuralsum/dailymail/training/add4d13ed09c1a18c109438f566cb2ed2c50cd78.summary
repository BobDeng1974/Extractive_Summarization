by @entity1 reporter @entity3 ' safety crisis worsened on monday when the automaker added 8.2 million vehicles to its ballooning list of cars recalled over faulty ignition switches			1
the latest recalls involve mainly older midsize cars and bring @entity3 's total this year to 29 million , surpassing the 22 million recalled by all automakers last year			1
@entity3 said the recalls are for ' unintended ignition key rotation ' and cover seven vehicles , including the @entity16 from 1997 to 2005 , the @entity17 from 2004 to 2008 , and the 2003 - 2014 @entity18			1
another recall : this 200 @entity16 is one of the millions announced recalled today the company is aware of three deaths , eight injuries and seven crashes involving the vehicles , although it has no conclusive evidence that faulty switches caused the accidents			1
ceo @entity29 said the recalls stem from an extensive safety review within the company			2
' if any other issues come to our attention , we will act appropriately and without hesitation , ' she said in a statement			2
the announcement of more recalls extends a crisis for @entity3 that began in february with small - car ignition switch problems			1
@entity3 recalled 2.6 million older small cars worldwide because the switches can unexpectedly slip from ' run ' to ' accessory , ' shutting off the engines			1
that disables power steering and power brakes and can cause people to lose control of their cars			0
it also stops the air bags from inflating in a crash			0
@entity3 has been forced to admit that it knew of the problem more than 10 years , yet it failed to recall the cars until this year			1
@entity3 's conduct in the small - car recall already is under investigation by the @entity60 and both houses of @entity62			1
earlier this year , the company paid a $ 35 million fine to the @entity65 for delays in reporting the small - car ignition switch problems			2
@entity3 has seen better days : this 2004 @entity17 was recalled today as it was announced @entity3 will offer no less than $ 1million to the families of those killed by faulty ignition switches the added ignition switch recalls raise questions about the safety of the switches in cars made by all manufacturers			1
on june 18 , @entity65 opened two investigations of @entity80 minivans and suvs as part of a widening inquiry into air bag and ignition switch problems across the @entity87 auto industry			0
@entity65 began asking automakers and parts suppliers for information on the interrelated issues after @entity3 's small - car recall			1
@entity65 asked automakers and parts makers for information on switches and how long air bags will inflate after the keys are moved out of the " run " position to ' accessory ' or ' off			0
' in many cases , the answer is less than a second			0
that led to the @entity80 inquiries , @entity65 said in a statement			0
' the agency examined all major manufacturers ' air bag deployment strategies as they relate to switch position , ' the agency said in a statement			0
' @entity65 will continue to refine its knowledge of these systems			0
' @entity3 's recalls on monday bring this year 's total so far to more than 40 million for the @entity87 industry , far surpassing the old full - year record of 30.8 million from 2004			1
the recalls come just hours after the company 's compensation consultant , @entity121 , announced plans to pay victims of crashes caused by the defective small - car switches			1
attorneys and lawmakers say about 100 people have died and hundreds were injured in crashes , although @entity121 said he did n't have a total			0
@entity121 said the company has placed no limit on how much he can spend in total to compensate victims			0
even cadillaccs : this cts is another of the many cars recalled monday by @entity3 @entity3 spokesman @entity139 said that in the @entity141 , the ignition can slip due to jarring from the road , a bump on the key from the driver 's knee or from the weight of a heavy key chain			1
in the older model midsize chevrolets , pontiacs and @entity150 , only jarring or heavy keys — and not a bump from the driver 's knee — can knock the ignition out of position			0
in all the cases , the ignition switches out of the " run " position and into the " accessory " or " off " position			0
@entity139 said that , unlike @entity3 's previous recall of 2.6 million @entity165 and other small cars , the ignition switch is made to @entity3 's specifications			2
but the keys can slip too easily			0
the company will place inserts on the keys to fix the issues			0
@entity139 said @entity3 began investigating all of its ignition switches 60 days ago after the @entity175 recall revealed problems			2
this recall came out of that investigation			0
@entity3 is urging people to remove everything from their key rings until the recalled cars can be repaired			1
of the three people who died in crashes involving the newly recalled vehicles , it 's unclear whether those deaths were ignition - related , @entity139 said			2
in each of the cases the air bags did n't deploy , but there are many reasons air bags do n't deploy , including the angle the car is hit and whether or not the occupants were belted , he said			0
@entity139 said victims in the newly recalled vehicles wo n't be included in the compensation fund that has been set up for the small - car case			2
the @entity200 company said it plans to take a $ 1.2 billion charge in the second quarter for recall - related expenses			2
added to a $ 1.3 billion charge in the first quarter , that brings total recall expenses for the year to $ 2.5 billion			2
@entity3 also announced four other recalls monday covering more than 200,000 additional vehicles			1
most are to fix an electrical short in the driver 's door that could disable the power locks and windows and even cause overheating			0
of the 29 million vehicles recalled this year , 17.1 million have been over ignition switches @entity3 's stock fell 27 cents , or less than one percent , to $ 36.36 in late afternoon trading			1

the automaker has now recalled over *22million* vehicles due to the defect
the announcement came on the same day it was announced @entity3 would pay no less than $ 1million to the families of those killed by the defect
