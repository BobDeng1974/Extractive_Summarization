federal investigators are looking into a former county prosecutor 's allegation in a lawsuit that he was fired because he complained about gov. @entity5 officials dropping indictments against political allies of the governor			1
@entity9 , a former @entity10 assistant prosecutor , claims in the lawsuit that he was terminated for suggesting that politics influenced the dismissal of an indictment against former county undersheriff @entity15 , and one other county official in 2011			0
@entity9 said he had a more than hour - long conversation with a criminal investigator for the @entity19 on wednesday and provided details of the lawsuit and evidence he has to back up his claims			0
fired : @entity9 alleged he was fired because he complained about gov. @entity5 ( photographed ) officials dropping indictments against @entity5 's political allies @entity9 said the investigator asked him about an allegation in his lawsuit that @entity30 told a reporter that @entity5 would step in and ' have this whole thing thrown out ' after he was accused of misconduct and indicted by a grand jury in 2010			1
@entity30 has denied making the statement , and @entity5 , a potential 2016 presidential candidate , has denied any involvement in the dropping of the indictment			1
@entity9 reached out last april to @entity41 @entity40 attorney @entity39 , whose office also is investigating apparently politically motivated @entity44 traffic lane closures by @entity5 allies			1
@entity39 wrote back to @entity9 in june , according to a letter obtained by @entity47 , saying , ' it is not apparent on the face of your submission that there have been potential violations of federal criminal law warranting this @entity56 's review			2
' @entity39 directed @entity9 to contact one of the office 's investigators ' to further assess whether your allegations may implicate such statutes			2
' lawsuit : the lawsuit claims that the indictments of former county undersheriff @entity15 ( left ) and then - sheriff @entity66 ( right ) were dropped by the state attorney general 's office because the investigation exposed the possible involvement of a campaign donor to @entity5 a spokesman for @entity39 declined to comment on thursday			1
@entity9 said the investigator who met with him , who was n't the one to whom @entity39 referred him , asked about @entity41 's official misconduct statutes and whether there were corresponding federal statutes			2
@entity5 's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment thursday , but in 2012 it denied any involvement in the case			1
' this is conspiracy theory stuff from someone who is obviously casting a wide net with hopes of coming up with a big fish or something , ' @entity5 spokesman @entity82 said at the time			1
' @entity5 is not named in the lawsuit , which seeks damages including lost wages			0
the lawsuit says the indictment against then - sheriff @entity66 and the two subordinates was dropped by the state attorney general 's office because the investigation exposed the possible involvement of a campaign donor to @entity5			2
@entity9 , a former state deputy attorney general who worked on the county 's prosecution of former @entity104 star @entity103 , says in the lawsuit he argued hundreds of appeals for the attorney general 's office in front of the @entity109 and state @entity110 and consistently received top performance reviews			0
his problems began , the filing says , when the attorney general 's office stepped in to take over the case against @entity66 , @entity30 , and investigator @entity116 the 2010 indictment against the trio charged official misconduct , falsification of employment records , and other offenses			0
nonsense : @entity5 spokesman @entity82 said @entity9 's claims are ' nonsense ' and ' conspiracy theory stuff ' among the allegations in @entity9 's lawsuit was that @entity116 and @entity30 produced fake law enforcement id cards , one of which was given to @entity132 executive @entity131 , a contributor to @entity5 's campaign who served on his transition team			1
the attorney general 's office took over the case and dropped the indictment several months later , citing ' legal and factual deficiencies , ' an unusual move considering the grand jury had effectively given its stamp of approval			0
there was no attempt to present the charges again to the grand jury to correct the deficiencies , @entity9 says			0
@entity9 was suspended soon after and later was terminated , the result , according to the filing , of his telling county acting prosecutor @entity151 he felt the dismissal was politically motivated			0
@entity9 's meeting with investigators was first reported thursday by the @entity155 .			0

@entity9 alleged he was fired because he complained about gov. @entity5 officials dropping indictments against @entity5 's political allies
