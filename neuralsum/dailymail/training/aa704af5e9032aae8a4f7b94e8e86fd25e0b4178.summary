the thought may make many go a bit green about the gills , but if you ca n’t stand @entity5 sprouts on your plate at @entity20 then how about trying them as a refreshing juice instead ? @entity2 is to combine the much - maligned vegetable with apple and pear for a sweet and tasty drink that adds a healthy element to the usual festive binge			1
the juice adds up to two of the five daily portions of fruit and vegetables that are recommended for a healthy diet			1
together with a sprout - based coleslaw , it is among many innovations that are being introduced by @entity2 for its festive food collection this year – not all of them for the more virtuous diner			1
following the successful launch of its fish and @entity42 , the chain will be selling an indulgent @entity20 dinner in a pie this year – complete with turkey , stuffing , pigs in blankets and cranberry sauce			2
and for those who want a bite - size version of @entity20 , the party food range includes @entity20 dinner on a stick			1
a team of 40 - strong product developers at @entity2 began working on the range in september last year and have flown to @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 to find the latest trends and ingredients			0
innovative new products include a @entity20 cake liqueur and an edible cheese board made from crackers			0
there is also a gin flavoured with tea and dressed with gold flakes , which @entity2 is calling the @entity71			2
as an alternative to the traditional pudding , it has developed a collection @entity75 , which comes trimmed with led lights , and a @entity79 decadent chocolate pudding			0
the company ’s food halls are a magnet for @entity83 and the chain ’s @entity20 sales have continued to boom despite the six years of austerity that many have endured			0
