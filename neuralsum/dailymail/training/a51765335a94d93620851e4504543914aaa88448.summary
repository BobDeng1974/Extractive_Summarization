a new breast cancer drug from @entity1 has shown ' unprecedented ' benefits in extending lives in a clinical trial			1
patients with a type of breast cancer known as @entity8 positive , which makes up about a quarter of all breast cancers , who were given @entity12 on top of older medicine @entity15 and chemotherapy lived 15.7 months longer than those on @entity15 and chemotherapy alone			1
experts urged its widespread use for women with an aggressive form of the disease			0
patients with a type of breast cancer known as @entity8 positive , which makes up about a quarter of all breast cancers , who were given @entity12 on top of older medicine @entity15 and chemotherapy lived 15.7 months longer than those on @entity15 and chemotherapy alone			1
both @entity15 and @entity12 are antibodies designed to block the function of @entity8 , a protein produced by a cancer - linked gene			1
@entity12 , also known as pertuzumab , binds to a different part of the same protein , which makes combining the two drugs extra effective			0
@entity12 , which was approved by regulators two years ago , was tested in the @entity1 - backed study involving more than 800 women			0
researchers had previously reported the @entity12 drug regimen significantly extended progression - free survival , or the period of time patients live without their disease worsening , but the final overall survival data has taken longer to collect			1
while both @entity12 and @entity15 have side effects , including rash , diarrhea and a potentially adverse impact on heart function , using the two drugs together did not make these issues any worse			2
that is the longest extension to survival ever seen for a drug studied in metastatic breast cancer and also an unusually good result for any type of metastatic cancer , where disease has spread to other parts of the body			1
the result is a vindication of combining medicines that fight tumor cells in a variety of ways			0

' the results , i think , are phenomenal , ' lead researcher @entity79 from the @entity82 told the @entity84 ( @entity84 ) annual congress in @entity85 on sunday			0
' the survival improvement of nearly 16 months ... is unprecedented among studies of metastatic breast cancer			1
' @entity12 , which was approved by regulators two years ago , was tested in the @entity1 - backed study involving more than 800 women			0
researchers had previously reported the @entity12 drug regimen significantly extended progression - free survival , or the period of time patients live without their disease worsening , but the final overall survival data has taken longer to collect			2
the median overall survival time was 56.5 months for those given @entity12 against the already impressive 40.8 months for patients taking only the older drugs			1
looking at the study results a different way , the risk of dying was reduced by 32 percent for women who received the @entity12 regimen compared to those who got @entity15 and chemotherapy			1
while both @entity12 and @entity15 have side effects , including rash , diarrhea and a potentially adverse impact on heart function , using the two drugs together did not make these issues any worse			2
' i think these data are really compelling , ' said @entity119 of the @entity120 , who was not involved in the research			0
' when you see in breast cancer such a big change in survival with not a lot of cardio - toxicities then that is really practice - changing			2
' @entity79 and @entity129 , another researcher on the study from the @entity131 in @entity132 , said the results suggested using @entity12 should now be the standard of care for @entity8 positive breast cancer patients			1

a favorable reaction from oncologists will underpin expectations of strong sales for @entity12 , which analysts currently expect to sell $ 3.1 billion a year by 2018 , according to consensus forecasts compiled by @entity152 @entity151			0
but it poses a challenge for healthcare providers , since @entity12 and @entity15 are costly injectable drugs and the multiple - drug regimen promises to strain budgets			2
in the @entity161 , the monthly price of @entity12 is approximately $ 5,900 , while @entity15 costs around $ 5,300 , a @entity1 spokeswoman said			2
prices in @entity163 are lower			0
for @entity1 , @entity12 is an important new product that should help defend its position in breast cancer , following the success of @entity15 , which was first approved in 1998			1
the company said the latest data would be submitted to regulatory authorities around the world for inclusion in the prescribing information for @entity12			0
the @entity175 drugmaker also has another related drug called @entity177 , which is also being tested in combination with @entity12			0
some analysts believe @entity177 's prospects could be curbed if results from that combination are not better than the impressive findings reported this weekend .			0
