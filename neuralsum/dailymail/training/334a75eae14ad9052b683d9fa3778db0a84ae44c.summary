by @entity0 a @entity2 zoo has provoked an outcry after putting down a brown bear cub because it was being bullied by its ' jealous ' father			1
the cub was among two born earlier this year to @entity7 and @entity8 , who were gifts from then - @entity11 president @entity10 in 2009			1
but keepers at @entity14 's @entity13 refused to separate the animals - even after @entity7 killed his other cub in front of horrified families last week			1
horrified : the cub , pictured , was put down by keepers this week at @entity13 in the @entity2 capital bern distress : the cub , nicknamed @entity23 4 , was not separated from its father even after its twin @entity25 was killed in the enclosure			1
it is common for males and even females to kill their own cubs keepers claimed the mother of the cub , right , was neglecting it and they could not account for nature 's course when 360kg male @entity7 started being aggressive towards @entity23 4 , as the cub was called , zoo chiefs decided to kill it instead of raising it in solitude			1
but @entity2 animal protection , the country 's oldest and largest animal rights group , was in uproar			2
it condemned the action in the ' strongest possible terms ' and said the zoo has massively mishandled the situation			0
a spokesman for the group added : ' it is not natural to keep the male bear with the offspring , and there was more than enough space to have kept him in a separate part of the cage			1
' in the wild , female bears typically drive away males to protect cubs because males can see them as rivals and attempt to kill them			0
despite this , the zoo defended its position even after the first cub was killed last wednesday			2
keepers said separating @entity7 or @entity8 from their cub would lead to other problems , and cause lasting damage for the welfare of all the bears involved			1
attack : horrified families looked on last week as @entity7 killed the first of the two cubs , pictured			1
males often turn against their cubs because they see them as competition , and even females can attack their young killed : the other cub , @entity23 3 , being mauled by its father last week torn apart : 360kg male @entity7 killed his other cub ( pictured ) last wednesday but keepers kept their policy pictured : the cub which was killed last week			1
@entity2 's animal rights group condemned the decision @entity94 , the zoo 's deputy director , said : ' after 12 weeks it was clear that @entity8 was irreparably neglecting her role as mother of cub number four			1
' together with the fact that the male bear @entity7 had started demonstrating the same aggressive behaviour as he did to cub number three , in order to protect cub number four from more stress and pain , we decided to act			1
as a result the baby bear was euthanised by a vet			0
' it remains unclear now as then as to why our bears behaved in this way			0
after killing cub number three on april 2 there was an uneasy truce for 48 hours but since the weekend @entity7 again started to show the same aggression			1
' attempting to distract them and temporarily separating the older animals has only brought short - term easing of the situation			0
but it also resulted in @entity8 ignoring the cub even more			2
' @entity7 and @entity8 are lovely hand - reared orphaned bears who came to us in 2009			1
they never had the chance to learn from other bears how to behave and their mothers were killed by poachers			2
euthanised : the cub put down by the zoo ( pictured ) was born in january and was one of two expert : brown bear specialist prof @entity137 said bears ' natural aggression was well - known and it was ' a shame to allow the male to kill his cub in the zoo ' ' we have tried when they were here to keep as much distance between them and humans as possible			1
our priority is the two adult bears			0
' having young animals is a natural part of the life cycle of every animal and we wanted to ensure that @entity7 and @entity8 had the chance as well			2
but the loss of the young animals in a biological sense and also according to basic principles of good animal protection are less serious than the loss of an adult			0
' the loss of cub number four has affected all of us here			0
because @entity7 and @entity8 appeared to be clearly unable to fulfil their role as parents , @entity7 will be sterilised in the next few weeks			2
' he added he did not want to see a repeat of @entity169 the polar bear - who was effectively sentenced to a life of solitude in a @entity175 zoo after being rejected by his mother			2
in 2007 , an animal rights activist controversially said @entity169 should have been killed rather than being held in captivity alone			0
yet when two cubs were born at another @entity2 zoo in january this year , keepers solved the problem by separating the parents and leaving the cubs with their mother			0
different policy : sixty miles away , two cubs born at the @entity189 animal park were separated from their father happy family : a cub in @entity193 with its mother			0
the @entity14 zoo said it was worse to lose an adult than a cub @entity199 gave birth to @entity201 and @entity202 at @entity189 animal park near @entity204 - just 60 miles from @entity14			2
professor @entity137 , chairman of the brown bear expert team for the @entity206 , said bears ' natural aggression was well - known and it was ' a shame to allow the male to kill his cub in the zoo '			1
he told @entity212 : ' in nature the male bear separates from the female after mating season and is not present with his cubs			0
' it is not unusual that the male kills his cubs in captivity			0
even the mother sometimes does			0
' but he added : ' zoos have too many captive bears and it is almost impossible to send them somewhere			0
surplus bears have to be euthanised , and it is better to do that at a very young age when the mortality in nature is also the highest			0

@entity233 was among two born to @entity7 and @entity8 at @entity234 in @entity14
the bears were *donated* by @entity11 president @entity10 in 2009
fears were raised after ' jealous ' male @entity7 killed cub 's twin last week
when @entity7 started acting the same way to other cub , the zoo *intervened*
welfare group : was ' more than enough space ' to keep the bear separate
