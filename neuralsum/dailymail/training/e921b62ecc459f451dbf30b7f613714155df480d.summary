a leading public health expert 's proposal to lower the age of consent to 15 has been swiftly rejected by the prime minister			1
professor @entity4 , president of the @entity5 , said society had to accept ' the facts ' that around a third of boys and girls have sex at 14 or 15			1
he argued that lowering the current legal age of 16 would make it easier for 15 - year - olds to get sexual health advice from teachers and health workers			1
prime minister @entity18 swiftly rejected a leading public health expert 's proposal to lower the age of consent to 15 professor @entity4 says the government should consider lowering the age of sexual consent to 15 countries in @entity25 that have lower ages of consent tend to see teenagers starting sexual relationships later and have lower rates of teenage pregnancy , he claimed			1
but @entity32 shot down the idea , saying the age at 16 was in place to protect children and there were ' no plans to change it '			1
prof @entity4 said lowering it by a year could actually prevent teenagers having sex at 14 or younger			1
he said : ' i would not personally argue for 14 but i think we should seriously be looking at 15 so that we can draw a line in the sand , and really , as a society , actively discourage sexual involvement under 15			1
' by doing that you would be able legitimately to organise services to meet the need			0
' he added : ' i suspect we might be better off with it at 15 because the teachers and people who are in contact with young people would feel on a firmer footing pointing them in the right direction where they can get advice and contraception to protect their physical health from disease and other problems			1
' the president of the @entity5 says society sends ' confused ' signals about when sex is permitted the @entity5 , which represents doctors working in this field , is independent of government but advises ministers and civil servants			1
the age of consent is 14 in @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			2
it is 15 in @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 , and 16 in @entity88 , the @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92			2
in @entity94 it is 13 but is being raised to 16			0
@entity95 said he was worried about ' high levels of teenage pregnancy ' but thought ' modernising ' sex education in schools rather than lowering the age of consent was the answer			1
@entity103 spokesman @entity102 agreed that changing the age of consent was not the way to tackle teenage pregnancy			2
' i 'm worried , like everybody 's worried , about the sexualisation of the culture and the information that so many young people are bombarded with at the moment			2
that 's why i do want see action , ' he told @entity117 's the @entity116			0
' i 'm constantly urging ( @entity119 ) @entity118 and the @entity120 to update and modernise sex education in schools which has n't kept up with the internet age			1
' but do i think simply a blanket reduction in the age of consent is the answer to this difficult dilemma ? no. ' @entity95 said he does not think lowering the age of consent was the solution to the problem shadow public health minister @entity102 said @entity103 opposed lowering the age of consent and called for mandatory sex and relationship education			2
ms @entity102 said the opposition had tried to get such changes enshrined in law but @entity136 mps blocked the moves in @entity138			0
she said : ' lowering the age of consent is not the way to tackle teenage pregnancy and we are against such a move			0
shadow public health minister @entity102 called for mandatory sex and relationship education ' the teenage pregnancy rate fell substantially under the last @entity103 government			0
but sexual health clinics are now closing their doors and young people are struggling to get appointments			0
' @entity103 has called for improved sex and relationship education , and tabled amendments to recent legislation for it to be made mandatory , not voluntary , in all schools			0
' regrettably , the change was voted down by @entity136 mps			0
' in 1875 the @entity157 raised the age of sexual consent from 12 to 13 in @entity160 and @entity161			0
ten years later , the @entity162 raised it again , to 16			0
according to organisations such as the @entity165 , an age of consent of 16 criminalises more than half the teenage population and makes it hard to give them proper advice and support to prevent diseases , unwanted pregnancies and abuse			0
the @entity5 , part of the royal colleges of physicians , gives advice to ministers and civil servants although it is independent of government .			2
