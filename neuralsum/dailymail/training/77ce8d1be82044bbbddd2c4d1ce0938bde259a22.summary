accused : @entity0 did kill his ' only @entity2 friend ' and two others in a drug deal gone wrong according to court documents filed by federal prosecutors regarding the trial of his younger brother in @entity10 today @entity11 bomber @entity0 did participate in a brutal triple murder 16 months before the deadly marathon attack according to court records filed on tuesday			1
@entity15 , described as @entity0 's ' only @entity2 friend ' , @entity15 and @entity15 were murdered at their home in @entity18 , @entity10 on the 10th anniversary of 9/11			1
their bodies were found covered in marijuana in the apartment and at the time authorities revealed their throats had been slit with a knife or ice pick and around $ 5,000 was left at the scene			2
the startling disclosure was made by federal prosecutors who are trying to prevent his younger brother 's legal team from obtaining documents concerning the killing of the three men on september 11 , 2011			1
it is the first official statement that links the now - dead elder @entity0 to the unsolved crime and raises questions about the death in may of his friend @entity41 , who allegedly confessed his and @entity0 's involvement to @entity44 agents before he was shot dead after charging them			1
' according to @entity0 's friend @entity41 , @entity0 participated in the @entity18 triple homicide , ' prosecutors wrote in a motion filed on monday according to @entity50			1

while this has no legal bearing on the terror charges that the 20 - year - old suspect faces , the defense team is keen to prove that @entity61 was frightened or in thrall to his over-powering elder brother			0
this would help fight against a possible recommendation against the death penalty			0
in turn , prosecutors have argued the documents hold little value to the younger @entity0 's defense and handing over the files would jeopardise the @entity89 district attorney 's ongoing and ' active ' investigation into the @entity18 murders			1
a judge is yet to rule on the decision			0
however , the assertion that @entity0 was definitely involved in the gruesome murders raises more questions about the death of @entity97 in may , who was shot and killed by an @entity44 agent in his own @entity101 apartment			1
he was being interviewed by federal agents and @entity103 about the @entity18 murders and unconfirmed media reports from the time of the killings stated that he implicated himself and @entity61			1
he then charged the law enforcement officials who shot him dead , even though he was unarmed			1
he allegedly become violent when police quizzed him over links to @entity0 and the unsolved 2011 triple homicide			2

the suspects did n't want the three victims to be able to identify them , so they slit their throats , according to the network			0
deceased : @entity41 was fatally shot by an @entity44 agent			2
initial reports said he had a knife but that was not true dna evidence apparently led them to @entity97 and his @entity101 apartment not far from @entity153 on may 22			0
he had been questioned for some hours before he allegedly flipped and the shooting came as one agent stepped out of the room , leaving @entity97 alone with one officer , the @entity154 said at the time			0
in april , when asked if @entity0 's implication in the @entity162 would make them reopen the case , a spokesman for the @entity88 's office was guarded			2
' the 2011 triple homicide is an extremely important case for us and remains an active and open investigation			0
' ' any information that comes forward as a result of the investigation into @entity172 and the @entity11 bombings will be immediately reviewed and pursued			0
