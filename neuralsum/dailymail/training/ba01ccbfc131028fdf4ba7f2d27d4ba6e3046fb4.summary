by @entity0 published : 19:43 est , 5 february 2013 updated : 02:46 est , 6 february 2013 @entity1 will condemn cultural sensitivities for hindering the fight against forces marriages , honour crimes and genital mutilation immigrant communities can not adopt a ‘ pick ’ n ’ mix approach ’ to living in a liberal democracy , a @entity8 minister will insist today			1
@entity13 @entity1 will attack multicultural doctrines which have meant the state turning a blind eye to so - called ‘ honour crimes ’ , forced marriage and female genital mutilation			1
he will condemn ‘ misplaced cultural sensitivities ’ for a failure to tackle such issues in @entity22			0
speaking at an event in the @entity25 , mr @entity1 will warn that ‘ thousands – perhaps hundreds of thousands ’ of women and girls in this country are not enjoying the proper ‘ benefits of living in our liberal society ’			1
he will add : ‘ that is not because of some accident or oversight			0
it is because of a deliberate rejection of the emancipation revolution and the equal opportunities now afforded to women and girls			1
‘ this situation is wrong			0
it is unacceptable for the individual women and girls whose freedom and opportunities are stifled			1
' and it is wrong for our society			0
there can not be a pick’n’mix approach to living in a benign liberal country			0
the benefits must be universal , without exceptions or exemptions			0
‘ i do not believe that cultural relativism provides an excuse to opt out of our shared liberal social settlement			0
everyone should enjoy the freedom to make their own choices , without the fear of social coercion			2
’ mr @entity1 will insist that forced marriage has ‘ no place ’ in @entity22 society , pointing out that the victims are ‘ overwhelmingly young women and girls ’			1
up to 8,000 young women a year are being pushed into marriage without their consent in @entity22 , it is feared			2
their families are mainly from @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			0
mr @entity1 says fears over offending minorities have dogged the fight against forced marriages currently , the authorities have to try to prove that other laws , such as kidnapping , false imprisonment , harassment or assault , have been broken by those responsible			1
but mr @entity1 will say the @entity93 will create a specific criminal offence making it illegal to force a child or grandchild into a marriage against their wishes			2
ministers argue a blind eye has been turned to extremism for too long for fear of offending minorities			0
some schools have even refused to put up posters advising pupils about forced marriage for fear of causing offence or being branded racist			2
mr @entity1 will also express alarm about the ‘ abhorrent ’ practice of female genital mutilation , citing evidence that around 20,000 girls in @entity22 are at risk .			1

multiculturalism should not allow crimes like forced marriages , says minister
@entity13 @entity1 says equality must apply to all
it is ' unacceptable ' to stifle freedom and opportunities for women and girls
