more than 2,000 bright children from poor homes are missing out on places at top universities because they get lost in a ‘ secondary school maze ’ , according to new research			1
these disadvantaged students are being overtaken by less able but more well - off pupils despite their early promise			0
former labour health secretary @entity9 , chairman of the @entity10 , which published the findings , warned @entity13 is wasting talent on ‘ an industrial scale ’			1
more than 2,000 bright children from poor homes are missing out on places at top universities because they get lost in a ' secondary school maze ' ( file picture ) researchers tracked the progress of high achieving pupils from poor backgrounds throughout the education system and compared it to that of their more advantaged counterparts			1
they examined a sample of more than 520,000 children born in 1991 - 2 and looked at the proportion attending elite universities as well as prior attainment at ages seven , 11 , 16 and 18			1
measures of the children ’s socio - economic background such as the proportion claiming @entity34 - an indicator of poverty - during secondary school were also analysed			0
children from poorer backgrounds who were high achievers in tests age seven were more likely ‘ to fall off a high attainment trajectory than children from richer backgrounds ’ , the study found			1
they performed worse than lower - achieving students from the least deprived families by @entity48 ( age 14 - 16 ) at secondary school			0
lower - achieving affluent children caught up with the poor high achievers between @entity53 ( ages seven to 11 ) and @entity48			2
this suggested that ‘ substantial ’ numbers of children from poorer backgrounds are being allowed to fall behind , with their chances of attending university damaged			2
former labour health secretary @entity9 , pictured , warned @entity13 is wasting talent on ' an industrial scale ' of the 7,853 children from the most deprived homes who achieved ‘ level five ’ in @entity64 and maths aged 11 - above the standard expected of their age - only 906 went on to an elite university			1
researchers calculated that if they had the same trajectory as a child from one of the least deprived families , then 3,066 of these children would have been likely to go to a top institution			2
this means that 2,160 poor children are falling behind and not fulfilling their potential displayed in primary school tests			2
the report , compiled for the commission by the @entity84 , said : ‘ the period between @entity53 and @entity48 appears to be a crucial time to ensure that higher - achieving pupils from poor backgrounds remain on a high achievement trajectory			0
’ universities and policymakers should provide poor students with advice to ‘ encourage greater numbers of applications to elite institutions , as those with the top grades stand a good chance of getting in if they do apply ’			0
mr @entity9 said : ‘ each year , 2,000 of the brightest poor children who have done well at primary school seem to lose direction in a secondary school maze and so miss out on a top university place			1
‘ the early promise of top - performing poor children is being squandered			1
no doubt there are many reasons for why that might be the case			0
‘ but for secondary schools the research is a wake - up call for them to do more to realise the potential of each of these students			0
’ he added : ’ it is vital that secondary schools focus harder on helping disadvantaged children convert high results at age 11 to excellent gcse and a-level results in academic subjects and that all high attainers are given appropriate advice , access to opportunities and support to progress to elite universities			0
‘ if @entity13 ’s sluggish rates of social mobility are to improve the poorest bright children must be helped to navigate the secondary school maze			1
’ @entity137 , director of research at the @entity139 , said : ‘ it is vital we do more to support highly able children from low and middle income backgrounds in state schools			0
‘ with the demise of the gifted and talented programmes , too many schools are not doing enough to stretch and encourage students with the potential to succeed			0
