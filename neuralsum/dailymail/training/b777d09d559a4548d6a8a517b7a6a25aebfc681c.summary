@entity1 characters are known as fun - loving and cuddly sorts â€“ but a @entity4 man discovered that they are capable of violence if provoked			1
a heckler in a @entity9 square pushed two street performers dressed as @entity11 and @entity12 over the edge and got a bloodied nose as a result			1
a brawl between the three erupted when entertainers @entity17 and @entity19 lost their temper at the critic , who they said ' just would n't leave us alone '			1
his partner then takes off her @entity12 head too as she follows the tussle around the square shouting abuse and grabbing at the man 's clothing			1
@entity43 - by @entity44 said : ' it 's certainly not something you see every day			2
' he added : ' he 'd been heckling their balloon bending magic act for some time and it seems they 'd had enough			0
' police halted the brawl by separating the heckler - later identified as @entity57 - and @entity17 , who by now had a bloody nose			1
@entity60 said : ' we have a good children 's show but he just would n't leave us alone			0
' @entity54 spokesman @entity65 said : ' three people have been interviewed over a public disturbance			0
' police halted the brawl by separating the heckler ( right ) and @entity11 and @entity12 according to local media the incident , which was widely shared on social media in @entity4 , could also have unfortunate consequences for the pair after local @entity1 representatives said they were not licensed , and officials are compelled to take action to ban them from using the cartoon characters in future			1
it follows footage emerging of a @entity84 driver being left dazed and confused after he was attacked by a group dressed as cartoon characters including @entity34 and @entity87 in a bizarre road rage incident			2
footage of the incident , which shows the driver as he stops his vehicle in front of a minibus in the @entity95 , became an internet hit			2
the unverified footage , filmed on another vehicle 's dashboard camera , apparently shows the driver as he gets out of his vehicle and appears to remonstrate with the driver of the minibus			0
before long however he finds himself outnumbered as four people dressed as cartoon characters , including @entity105 from @entity106 and a @entity84 character called @entity108 , sneak around the side of the minibus before confronting him			0
the group then appears to proceed to get the better of the driver as they force him to the ground and begin kicking and punching him			0
following the attack , which lasts for about 15 seconds , the group appear to get back into the van before it drives off .			0
