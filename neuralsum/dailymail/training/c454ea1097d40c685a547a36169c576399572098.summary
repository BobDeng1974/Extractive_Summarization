by @entity0 @entity1 insists sir @entity2 is owed an apology from people both ‘ in and out of football ’ after the ‘ needless ’ collapse of @entity6 in 2012			1
last week @entity2 pointed the finger at the taxman after a judge kicked out @entity11 ’ s appeal in their long - running case against the @entity15 club			1
the former owner and chairman said the so - called @entity19 case had put off potential buyers and led to @entity22 ’s disastrous takeover , while fans groups have already called for the @entity24 , @entity25 and other club owners to be held to account over the decision to relegate @entity6 when they went bust			2
leader : @entity6 boss @entity1 with players @entity31 ( left ) and @entity32 still got it : @entity1 kicks a ball around during training in @entity36 on tuesday @entity1 said he would ‘ never forget ’ the role played by leading figures in and around the @entity40 game in his club ’s descent into financial meltdown			1
as he called for answers from those he believes are truly responsible for his club ’s demise , however , the @entity6 boss conceded he wo n’t be holding his breath for any inquiry or apologies from those involved in the saga			1
speaking from his club ’s pre-season training base in @entity36 , @entity1 said : ‘ do people have serious questions to answer ? one hundred per cent			2
i do n’t know if i would use the word witch - hunt			0
but i would definitely say there are certain people that i would hope @entity2 would get some answers from in high - up places – both in and out of the game			2
‘ but i ’ll tell you right now - i do n’t think we would get an enquiry			0
and i would be very , very doubtful if @entity2 would get an apology from certain people either			1
‘ but it leaves , at best , a very , very bad taste in my mouth and in the mouths of a lot of people at @entity6 when you think of what has happened to this club			0
‘ it need n’t have happened and it ’s horrendous – and i will never forget some of the things which have been said and done to our club by people who should have known better			0
’ owed : @entity1 believes that former @entity84 's chief sir @entity2 deserves an apology meltdown : @entity22 , who took over from @entity2 , led the club to the point of ruin an under - pressure @entity2 sold @entity6 to @entity22 for a token £ 1 in may 2011 at a time when the club was in dispute with @entity11 over an @entity96 scheme set up a decade before			1
@entity6 subsequently plummeted into administration in february 2012 after the @entity99 regime failed to pay tax totalling £ 14million			0
@entity11 rejected proposals that could have prevented the @entity102 from being liquidated and ultimately demoted to @entity103 , but the tax man went on to lose the original @entity105 on the @entity96 case by a majority verdict in november 2013			0
@entity11 lost an appeal against that verdict last week .			0

@entity1 says @entity2 is owed an apology after ' needless ' @entity6 collapse
@entity115 boss also will ' never forget ' those involved in financial meltdown
