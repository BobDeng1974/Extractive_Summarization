but the beaming smile and glint of hope in his eyes say that he is doing well			2
this is @entity10 , the little boy taken on the run by his mother @entity12 after she refused to let doctors treat his cancer with radiotherapy because she thought it would ‘ fry his brain ’			1

my mum [ took me ] to hospital			2
they just did little things – like little movements			0
i had to move my neck and stuff like that			0
i had to stay at home for about two days and then go back there			0
’ what unfolded next was a nightmare : doctors discovered that he had a brain tumour the size of a 50p piece			1

he is pictured with his father @entity70 he said : ‘ i just remember seeing a computer screen with a scan of his head			1

this was a big thing that is growing fast and needs to be dealt with immediately			0
‘ it was so bang - bang - bang - bang - bang that there were no decisions to be made			1
‘ obviously i had to sign a piece of paper before he went into surgery , but there was obviously no reason for me ever to consider anything [ else ]			0
’ but @entity10 ’s mother – who is estranged from her husband – had other ideas following the removal of the tumour			1

she said : ‘ hospitals do him [ @entity31 ] no good			1
everyone loves to think that the doctors can have these almighty powers and heal us and do the right thing by us and , oh yes , they really care , but i beg to differ			2
they ’ve been through a very corrupt system where they ’ve been brainwashed			0
‘ we like to believe that they ’re going to do the best thing by us , but really , they ’ve done the best thing by the pharmaceutical companies			0
concerns : @entity119 packed a small bag of belongings and fled with @entity143 to @entity99 to an alternative medicine centre			0
it sparked a police hunt ‘ death by doctor is very common , but thankfully , because of the internet these days , a number of us have educated ourselves			0
' there ’s so many other options that we ’ve been deprived of , denied			2
and it ’s time for us all to wake up			1
’ @entity143 is halfway through his chemotherapy course and his family are overjoyed with his @entity158 father told the @entity160 : ‘ @entity143 is recovering well			2
he is much steadier on his feet these days			0
‘ both his physical strength and inner confidence are growing on a daily basis			0
the doctors are happy with his progress although we would all like to see him eating more as he is still underweight			2
@entity168 : @entity10 is pictured before his traumatic cancer ordeal ‘ his hair is growing back nicely and his skin around his radiotherapy treatment areas is much softer , less dry and no longer slightly discoloured			1
‘ he is almost halfway through his chemotherapy treatment now and is coping well with the monotonous routine blood tests and trips in and out of various hospitals			0
