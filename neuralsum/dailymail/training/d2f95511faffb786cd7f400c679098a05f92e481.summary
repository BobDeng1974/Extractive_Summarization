a couple who bought a micro-pig were stunned when their pint - sized family pet turned into a 670lb giant			2
@entity5 and @entity6 from @entity7 , @entity8 , adopted @entity9 thinking she would only grow to around 70lb , a respectable five stone			1
but they were tricked and two - year - old @entity9 has not stopped growing and is now heavier than a fully - grown female polar bear			2
she eats £ 30 of vegan food each week , enjoying a diet of rolled oats , barley and corn as well as fresh fruit and vegetables like over ripe bananas and vegetable peelings			1
she has become so big that the couple had to move into a farm to create enough room for her and their two dogs and a cat			0
@entity5 , who works in the property industry , said : ' we lived in denial for a long - time			1
friends would come over and say ' she 's getting bigger ' and @entity6 and i would say ' no she 's not '			1
' but soon she was standing up to steal things off the kitchen counters , the couch became smaller , and of course there was the weight gain			0
' we just adapted and loved her more			0
what else could we do ? it was n't her fault and we would never give up a pet			0
' as @entity65 , the giant porker has more than 230,000 friends on @entity67 her antics , such as playing in the snow in @entity8 's freezing winter , has earned her legions of fans online @entity6 and @entity5 adopted @entity9 as an adorable piglet who they did n't expect to exceed around 70lb in size the couple who 've moved into a farm , say @entity9 has changed their lives and they ' love her more ' @entity5 said : ' since we moved to the farm she has decided she needs to be close to us and now sleeps beside our bed with her mattress on the floor			1
' she still on occasion climbs up on to our bed for a nap during the day			0
' @entity9 has now found fame on @entity67 as @entity89 and has more than 230,000 friends who follow updates on their her exploits			1
@entity6 and @entity5 post pictures and video of the pig and sell calendars , postcards and mugs featuring the pink porker			1
@entity9 basks outside where she spends much of the day rooting around - in between her vegan meals the pink pig stays pristine with regular baths and her owners say she 's used to being fussed over the sow has a vegan diet and scoffs a range of dishes such as pizza , ripe bananas , vegetable peel and oats followers can watch her snoozing in a nest of stolen blankets , monopolising the sofa - as well as the dog bed - or sprawling across the living room floor leaving little room for anyone else			1
the pair have now created another @entity67 page , @entity123 , to feature the vegan food they prepare for their rambunctious pet , including spinach lasagne and chocolate chip granola bites			1
speaking about @entity9 's online popularity , @entity5 added : ' it is still surreal and absolutely mind - boggling			2
' we started @entity9 's page just as a way for immediate friends and family to stay in touch with us and @entity9 's antics			0
the sheer size of the toilet - trained pig dwarfs the furniture in @entity6 and @entity5 's farmhouse @entity9 joins in when guests come round for tea and her owners say people treat her like royalty the porker clearly loves to eat and gets through £ 30 of fruit , vegetables and grains each week ' but one of those friends shared @entity9 's page on an animal - related website and the next thing we knew @entity9 's page had 10,000 likes and it never stopped			1
' @entity6 and i are @entity9 's voice and some days it is really challenging to come up with new quips and i will sit there staring at a picture until something comes to me			2
' other days it 's as if i can read @entity9 's thoughts and i swear she can convey them with her eyes and her smile			0
' people 's reaction to meeting @entity9 still amazes us , it 's like they 're meeting a movie star or royalty			0
' even now people are amazed by her size and her awareness			2
' it is as if she knows she is famous and that is her role , that she is changing the world 's view of her kind and their amazing abilities to think , feel and be loved			0
' the animal , thought to be a commercial pig , looks fetching in a patterned housecoat the right shade of pink a pig 's life : @entity9 closes her eyes in pleasure after tucking into a hearty meal - one of several each day			0
