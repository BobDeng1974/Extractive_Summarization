led away : @entity7 was today sentenced to a year in jail after he was convicted of misconduct he blasted @entity7 's insistence that he only had chivalrous intentions in ' counselling ' and ' spooning ' in bed with the semi-naked , vomiting woman			1
' you 're a trained police officer , ' the judge told him			1
' it 's not too far a stretch to believe that you could n't avoid being in that bed with a naked female			1
' the 29 - year - old alleged victim who was sat in the front row as @entity7 was sentenced appeared to sob as @entity7 was led away			1

although acquitted of raping the female fashion executive , each was convicted of three counts of misconduct for being in the woman 's apartment when they were supposed to be on patrol			1
' you were in bed with an intoxicated naked young woman - that is official misconduct , ' said mr @entity24			1
the judge criticised defence lawyer @entity68 's argument that @entity7 was more of a ' simpleton ' than a sexual predator			2
' simpleton like a fox , ' mr @entity24 said			0
' during your testimony , you told a story that was incredible , ' the judge added			2
' your testimony was classic for admitting what you could n’t deny , denying what you could n’t admit and classic tailoring of your testimony to the witnesses who testified before you			0
' last steps of freedom : @entity7 , arrives at state supreme court with attorney @entity68 @entity7 said he had gone back to the woman 's apartment three times after the first call - even placing a phony 911 call about a sleeping vagrant to provide a pretext for one of the visits - only to try to comfort her and give advice about drinking			1
people in this city must be able to rely on this , that when they call 911 for help , the police who arrive will , in fact , help , ' assistant district attorney @entity95 told the judge			2
' he demonstrated that he had no regard for the law			0
' @entity7 's lawyer @entity68 had pressed for probation , noting that the ex-officer 's first - time conviction was for a misdemeanour and already has already cost him his 17 - year job and his pension			1
probation officials had said there was no need to jail @entity7 , he added			2
' i 'm going to ask the court to have the same courage that that jury had in rendering that verdict , ' mr @entity68 said			0
some jurors said later that they had too much doubt to convict in a rape case with an accuser who acknowledged her memories were spotty - and without dna evidence implicating the officers			2
but the verdict spurred outrage from women 's advocates , a few of whom demonstrated outside the courthouse on monday			0
caught on camera : @entity137 footage shows the two police men outside the woman 's apartment @entity44 's sentencing was postponed until wednesday			1
@entity44 and @entity7 met the drunken woman in december 2008 after a taxi driver called for help getting her out of his cab			1
she told authorities she passed out and awoke to being raped in her bed , saying she acutely remembered being violated despite being unclear on significant parts of the night			0
and she secretly recorded a conversation days later in which @entity7 alternately denied they had sex but said ' yes ' twice when she asked whether he 'd used a condom			0
@entity7 told jurors he was trying to mollify her			0
the former officers acknowledged returning to her apartment three times without telling dispatchers or supervisors what they were doing - the genesis of their misconduct convictions			2
in fact , @entity7 admitted he even placed a phony 911 call about a sleeping vagrant to provide a pretext for one of the visits			0
the officers said she 'd asked them to come back and check on her , and @entity7 said he felt impelled to give her advice about drinking and to comfort her			1
he said that she made advances and he ultimately ended up cuddling with the barely dressed woman in her bed , but that they did n't have sex			2
@entity44 said he was sleeping on her sofa while the others were in the bedroom			0
still free : @entity44 leaves court after his sentencing is postponed until wednesday the woman said in a statement after the verdict that her ' world was turned upside - down by the actions of two police officers who were sent there to protect but instead took advantage of their authority and broke the law			1
' the case ignited protests from women 's advocates , who saw it as a discouraging example of the difficulty women face in coming forward with a sexual assault complaint			0
@entity202 , a member of the @entity205 's @entity2 board of directors , stood outside the courthouse , holding a sign that said , ' @entity208 : protect women			0
' she said she had been ' horrified ' by the rape acquittals			0
' we ca n't keep silent , ' she said			0
' we 're just sending a message to the people who make the policies , and the judges , that it 's not ok			0
' the case ultimately pitted the woman 's word , with some support from the recorded conversation , against the officers ' denials			2
at the trial , their lawyers underscored the lack of forensic evidence and the fact that the woman had sued			0
i thought she made the whole thing up , ' @entity7 said after the verdict			0
in trying to help her , he said , he ' made a judgement call ... and i paid for it			0
