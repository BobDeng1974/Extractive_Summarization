a 27 - year - old woman , who had her leg amputated just four years ago after a motorbike accident , has become a star in @entity4 with her remarkable dance moves on one leg			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity4 , came runner up on @entity4 ’s version of @entity12 ’s @entity11 this year but not before she won over the nation with her impressive talents			1
her show stopping moves could rival any able - bodied dancer and now the former nurse is touring the world with her talents			2
@entity21 has become famous as @entity4 's one - legged dancer after she shot to fame after she appeared on @entity4 's got talent show @entity7 wowed the judges and won over the nation when she took to the stage on @entity4 's @entity11 @entity7 ( in jeans ) who is now famous as one legged dancer is seen here dancing at a competition at her nursing school before the accident in which she lost one of her legs she said : ‘ i always loved dancing but my parents wanted me to study so i worked hard to become a nurse			1
the accident changed my life ; it not only took my leg but it gave me the determination to fulfill my dreams			1
now i ’m dancing for a living and i love it			0
’ @entity7 used to only dance in her bedroom when she was growing up ; too nervous to perform in front of an audience			1
‘ i was so shy i could n’t talk to anyone , i used to talk only when needed			2
i was a good student and i used to keep my head in my books , ’ @entity7 remembers			1
‘ @entity51 was a love of mine but it was never something i thought i ’d ever do professionally			0
’ but in october , 2009 , @entity7 ’s world was turned upside down			1
she caught a lift on the back of her friend ’s moped after college and just a few miles from home the bike skidded at speed on a sharp corner and both @entity7 and her friend were thrown off			1
‘ i fractured my knee badly but i was n’t dying , my life was n’t in danger thankfully , ’ she said			0
but at the local government hospital @entity7 was left lying in a bed for almost two weeks			1
@entity7 's mother ( right ) @entity73 , 56 , and her younger sister ( left ) @entity75 , 25 , supported her throughout her ordeal , which saw her undergo seven operations @entity7 , here working out in a gym in @entity80 , had to learn how to walk on one leg and was turned down from numerous dance schools because of her disability ‘ the negligence in a basic government hospital is terrible			1
my mum begged doctors to treat me , but they just put my leg in a brace and left me			2
they did n’t even attempt to treat my fracture			0
’ as @entity7 already had a congenital condition called @entity93 ( @entity94 ) , an abnormal connection between arteries and veins , doctors were apprehensive about surgery to insert plates to fix her fracture			1
eventually @entity7 had the operation on november 5th , 15 days after the accident			1
but during surgery , a doctor cut a vital vein and @entity7 began to bleed uncontrollably			1
the surgical team managed to stop the bleeding but cut short the operation			1
‘ when i woke up and saw my mother ’s face i knew the surgery had n’t gone well , ’ @entity7 added			1
the surgeon ’s incompetence meant i now had to wait for the veins in my leg to heal before they could even attempt to fix my fracture for the second time			2
’ she was sent home to recover but as weeks passed @entity7 ’s condition went from bad to worse			2
‘ i lost all feeling in my leg and slowly my toes , foot and my leg started to turn black			2
i was bed ridden for more than two months infection spread throughout her leg and in the end @entity7 found herself begging her mother to just cut off her leg			1
@entity7 's determination and spirit meant she eventually @entity130 , in @entity80 accepted her @entity7 ( centre in pink dress ) poses for a photograph with her choreographer ( on her right ) @entity134 , 28 , along with the other students at her dancing school in @entity80 , @entity4 she said : ‘ i turned to my mother and asked her do you think my leg will ever be the same again ? she knew the answer			1
i was sobbing , i was devastated but i knew that i had to cut it off , it was the only option left and the only chance i had of trying to get my life back			0
’ her mother @entity146 , 56 , travelled from one hospital to the next near their home in @entity152 village in @entity153 , northern @entity4 , begging doctors for their help			2
over a time period of 12 months , as @entity7 permanently lay in bed , her mother was looking for a doctor to help her			2
finally , dr @entity159 from the @entity160 , in @entity8 , agreed to do the operation on september 16 , 2010 , almost a year after the bike accident			2
@entity7 said : ' it was a huge decision for me but i knew there was no other way			2
if i wanted to survive i had to cut off my leg			0
i came to the conclusion it was better to amputate my leg than stay as it was			0
' ‘ when i woke after the operation tears filled my eyes out of pure happiness			0
that feeling of not having a lifeless leg was amazing			0
’ the surgery cost @entity177 ( £ 7,000 ) and she had to take out a loan to cover the costs			0
in total @entity7 needed seven operations before she could learn to walk again			1
@entity7 ( centre ) has always loved dancing and was determined to achieve her dreams despite her disability and this year , feeling positive about the future , @entity7 started reading a lot about disabled achievers			1
they gave her ideas and hope , inspiration to achieve her own dreams			0
and she decided to apply for @entity4 's @entity11			1
she said : ' my friends started ignoring me , people showed sympathy but it was pity			0
i did n’t want pity			0
i decided not to fall into darkness but show the world that i was a strong person and continue my passion for dance			0
my mother was shocked but happily agreed to support me			0
' @entity7 tried to enroll at dance studios around her home but she was rejected because of her disability			1
until eventually @entity130 , in @entity80 accepted her			0
her show stopping moves could rival any able - bodied dancer and now the former nurse is touring the world with her talents @entity73 said , ' my daughter was always a fantastic dancer but i had forced her into studies			0
after the operation , when she told me that she wanted to dance on tv , i was apprehensive but i supported her dreams			2
' and in february , @entity7 's audition on @entity4 ’s @entity11 amazed the judges and crowds			1
she was chosen for the final , but was piped to the show ’s first prize by @entity226 and @entity228 dance group and missed out on a £ 68,000 cash prize but she is not unhappy , the show has changed her life			0
