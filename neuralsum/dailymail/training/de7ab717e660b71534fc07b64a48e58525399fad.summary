an astronomical artist has created eye - opening illustrations imagining what the night sky would look like if the moon was replaced by the other planets in the solar system			1
@entity8 , a former art director for @entity9 , used digital trickery to superimpose scale drawings of @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 over the same landscape , highlighting the sheer size of the planets			1
the incredible drawings imagine each planet to be 233,812 miles from @entity24 - the same distance at which the moon orbits			2
enormous planet @entity15 , around 11 times the size of @entity24 , would dominate the skies while @entity14 would appear to be around twice the size of the moon			1
artist : @entity8 used this view of the moon over @entity34 , @entity35 , as the basis for his images perspective : the former @entity9 art director imagined how @entity18 would look from earth if it was the same distance away as the moon huge : the diameter of @entity15 is 40 times that of the moon and it would dominate the night sky if it were in the same position red planet : @entity14 would appear around twice the size of the moon from 233,812 miles away mr @entity8 , from @entity46 , @entity47 , said : ' we are all familiar with the moon in our skies but many people struggle to appreciate the sheer size of the planets we share our solar system with			1
' the planets are just a vague concept to a lot of people and even the moon is just a fuzzy ball in the sky			2
' i had a bright idea one morning to create a series of illustrations in which the moon is replaced with other planets , something i do n't think has been done before			2
i wanted the illustrations to be thought - provoking and catch people 's imaginations			0
' i wanted to show people the effects these planets would have on landscapes , and show them what amazing places the planets are			0
' he explained that @entity15 is so large that from @entity24 we would not be able to see the north and south poles of the planet , as it would fill the sky as far as we can see			1
while @entity16 's rings would stretch nearly from horizon to horizon			0
' we would all feel a lot more humble with @entity15 's presence constantly looking over us , ' he added			0
' the reaction to the illustrations has been fantastic			0
i 'm very pleased because they were created to inspire people			0
plus , the only way i get to visit these planets is through my illustrations			0
' orb : @entity17 would look a similar size to @entity18 , according to mr @entity8 , who has created the images to highlight the size of the planets night sky : smallest planet @entity12 would look just slightly larger than the moon from the same distance massive : @entity16 and its rings would cover almost 18 degrees of the night sky , according to mr @entity8 's calculations neighbour : @entity13 is only slighter smaller than earth so would appear around the same size as our planet does from the moon			1

former @entity9 art director @entity8 created images of it would look like from @entity24 if planets replaced moon
astonishing images show @entity15 and @entity16 would fill night sky while @entity12 is only slightly bigger than moon
