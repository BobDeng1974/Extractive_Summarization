the @entity0 is sending 272 staff to the @entity2 in @entity3 this summer - enough to field almost 25 football teams			1
licence - fee payers will spend £ 12million funding the trip to cover the month - long tournament in @entity8 starting on june 12			1
the bill will include five - star treatment for pundits @entity11 , 50 , @entity13 , 43 , @entity14 , 58 , and @entity15 , 39			0
boys trip : @entity14 , @entity11 and @entity13 will be among 272 @entity0 staff heading to the @entity3 @entity2 this summer corporation bosses have justified the spending by saying they plan to make @entity3 2014 the first ' 24/7 ' @entity2 and say it will cost viewers and listeners ' less than a pint of milk ' each			1
there will be 12 separate commentary teams covering more than 50 matches for tv and more than 60 for radio as well as shows including a documentary about @entity31 travelling to the @entity33 rainforest			2
@entity0 and @entity34 split @entity2 coverage down the middle yet the licence - fee funded @entity37 are sending more than double the number of personnel to @entity3 than their commercial rivals			1
bosses claim their bloated presence of 272 at the tournament is less than the excessive 295 they sent to @entity44 for the @entity45 but will be delivering up to 50 per cent more tv output			0
yet the @entity0 army compares with @entity34 making do with a 120 - strong task force in @entity8 , with most of those freelance operators			1
@entity0 director of sport @entity51 tried to justify the cost to taxpayers in a lengthy website blog claiming : ‘ our aspiration is to make @entity3 2014 the first 24/7 @entity2 , which will appeal to all age groups , is available across all devices at any time of the day or night			1
we will be producing all this for less than the cost of a pint of milk for each viewer , listener or website user			2
’ dream trip : the @entity0 has promised the first 24/7 tournament but needs double the amount of staff @entity34 does to do it blanket coverage : there will be 12 separate commentary teams covering more than 50 matches for tv and more than 60 for radio - including here at the @entity77 in @entity78 ms @entity51 added : ‘ throughout the planning process , all parts of the @entity0 have been acutely aware of striking a balance between editorial ambition and value for money '			1
but critics have accused the @entity0 of sending staff on a ' wasteful jolly '			1
@entity87 , of the @entity88 ’ @entity86 said : ‘ @entity0 continues to send an army of staff to cover big sporting events while other broadcasters manage to with far fewer			2
‘ the @entity0 needs to stop wasting so much of the licence fee on this extravaganza and cut back on the number of additional jollies that come with the coverage			2
‘ viewers want to watch the @entity2 , but they should n’t have to pay for so many extra staff to cover the games			0
’ it came in the week where fans accused the @entity104 of ripping them off over the £ 90 price of @entity107 's new shirt for the @entity2			0
fans are unhappy that the new , costly kit has been launched less than a year after the last new strip went on sale			0
problem : supporters fear they are being priced out of purchasing @entity107 's @entity2 strips - with the new @entity116 shirt costing £ 90 it was only last may that the previous home kit was released , which has been worn just seven times			0
the red away kit , released even more recently in june 2013 , has had just two airings			0
the £ 90 shirt is identical to those worn by @entity125 's side , while an adult ' stadium ' @entity107 shirt is priced at £ 60 and shirts for children aged between eight and 15 cost £ 42 , with mini-kits priced at £ 40			0
@entity133 has led calls for a ' rethink ' and insisted the charges are ' not right ' and risk punishing loyal supporters who are ' the bedrock of our national game ' .			0

cost to licence - payers will be £ 12million @entity0 says ' less than a pint of milk '
stars will be *flown* around @entity3 covering 60 games in 12 *cities*
critics say it is another ' jolly ' but @entity0 says it has reduced number of staff
@entity34 will be sending 120 staff to @entity8 for tournament
