by @entity0 this zoo primate looks like he is deep in thought after striking a pose just like @entity5 in his glory days on @entity7			1
the mandrill was seen bent over with its head on its fist and looking similar to the veteran @entity12 presenter			1
@entity13 took the photo of the photogenic ape at @entity16			1
aping : the mandrill ( right ) bends over with its head on its hand - similar to @entity5 on television ( left ) he said : ' he was sat in that position for quite some time			2
' he looks like he was posing but he was actually scratching his different parts of his head			0
' it was a piece of luck to get the photo			0
i waited for him to scratch his upper nose between his two eyes that look like he is thinking			0
maybe he was thinking about escaping			0
the versatile animal has also prompted comparisons with a classic sculpture after his resemblance to @entity33 by @entity35 artist @entity34 was noticed			1
the thinker was originally part of the compositional piece @entity34 created for the proposed @entity39 in @entity40			0
time out : @entity13 took the photo of the thinking ape at @entity16 classic artwork : the pensive primate also resembles @entity33 , a famous statue by @entity34 the piece , known as @entity48 , is based on the 16th century epic poem , @entity50 by @entity51			1
many of @entity34 's most famous works came out of this piece and the thinker was originally intended to sit at the top of the door way and represent @entity51 , as he composed the poem			2
for this reason @entity33 was originally known as the poet but as this piece began to gain precedence over @entity48 , it became known as @entity33 and is today a commonly recognised symbol of philosophy and learning .			0
