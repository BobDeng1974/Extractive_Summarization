@entity3 is expected to win elections to the @entity59 on may 22 , which mr @entity21 predicts will trigger a ‘ political earthquake ’ in @entity62			1
but his £ 1.5million campaign has been dogged by claims it is racist and features actors and party employees as ordinary members of the public			1

but today it emerged the party has been forced to suspend two members with far - right links			2
a spokesman said : ' @entity3 is a non-racist , non-sectarian party and we are determined to uphold those values			2
' part of that process is maintaining vigilance against the possibility of infiltration either on an organised or individual basis by those who do not subscribe to our values			0
' the men have not been identified by the party as they still have the right of an appeal in writing to @entity3 's national executive committee			1
@entity8 , a @entity3 candidate in @entity9 , @entity10 , tonight resigned from the party			1

he does not have to live with whites			0

' former @entity112 immigration minister @entity111 today launched a cross-party campaign to condemn @entity3 as racist			1

‘ the party is practicing what is in effect a form of ‘ @entity124 ’			2
’ the @entity126 campaign has been co-sponsored by senior @entity128 mp @entity127 and @entity130 peer @entity129			0
but on the campaign trail in @entity40 today , mr @entity21 hit back and accused his opponents of use ‘ discrgraceful slurs ’ against the @entity17 people			2

he likened it to the moment @entity112 leader @entity169 dismissed pensioner @entity170 as a ‘ bigoted woman ’ during the 2010 election after she voiced cocnerns about immigration			0
‘ this time it is not merely one person being slandered by one establishment party but huge numbers of decent @entity17 people under attack and all three @entity62 parties levelling the charge of racism and bigotry			0
‘ when @entity3 was perceived mainly as a threat to the @entity128 , it was @entity187 and his colleagues who used this tactic			2
now we are recognised as a threat to the entire establishment it is all three parties that are slinging mud			1
‘ the electorate is not in the mood to be intimidated by the political establishment and @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200 have just made another disastrous mistake			0
‘ i call on all fair - minded @entity17 people to swing behind @entity3 and teach these creeps a lesson they wo n't forget in a hurry			2
' @entity207 , the former labour home secretary , also questioned the @entity210 campaign			0
' i am not convinced that condemning the many voters thinking of voting @entity3 as stupid racists is a good electoral strategy , she wrote for @entity215			2
