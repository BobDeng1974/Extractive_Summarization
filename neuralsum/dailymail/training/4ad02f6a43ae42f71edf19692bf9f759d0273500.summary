the fun - loving 20 - year - old model landed her debut @entity7 @entity6 cover , walked in countless shows at fashion week and even posed alongside @entity10 in @entity12 's spring / summer13 campaign			2
but while the bushy - browed babe has seen her star rise rapidly ( and even been dubbed the new @entity16 ) , the future was n't always so bright			0
the 5 ' 9 " beauty was once - upon - a - time branded a ' dwarf ' by famed designer and @entity20 creative director @entity19			1
the long and short of of it : @entity19 , right , branded the model - of - moment , left , a ' dwarf ' and refused to cast her in his shows in fact , the fashion designer actually banned her from appearing in his autumn / winter 2012 - 13 shows because he thought she was too short and looked odd among his other models			1
speaking in an interview with @entity32 , @entity33 - who helps @entity19 decide which models to select for the runway - said : ' i was trying to get her [ @entity39 ] in the show , but it was the show in which everyone was very tall and very long			2
she 's made it : after his insult , he recruited @entity39 to walk in his @entity47 show last season , left , alongside @entity16 , right ' i remember @entity19 looking at me and saying , " why is that dwarf in here ? " , and me being devastated			0
' i apologised to her afterwards and made up for it by casting the model in all her key shows and shoots			0
' the outgoing model was cast for both @entity19 ' eponymous label and @entity20 , for whom he is creative director , back in march , and has now become one of his favourites , because she has ' great energy ' and is a good role model for other girls			1
zest for life : the designer has now changed his tune saying that @entity39 has great energy and is a role model to young women speaking recently , he said : ' she 's a silly goose			1
she has a great energy			2
she turned up to the @entity20 show wearing a zebra outfit from @entity76 , a onesie			0
' she 'd been traipsing round @entity79 all evening in it , you got to love a girl like that			0
it 's rare in life that you meet a person who does n't care			0
it sets a good example			0
' friends in high places : ( l to @entity91 ) designer @entity92 , @entity19 and model @entity16 attend a drinks reception it 's been one whole year since a @entity96 colouring book flew off the shelves and got the world putting crayonsto paper			1
designed by creative publishing label i love @entity102 , the colour me good @entity96 colouring book featured 15 pages of monochrome @entity96 in action			1
and now it is @entity2 's turn to have people reaching for the @entity110			0
@entity111 : from the creator of the famous @entity96 colouring book , comes everyone 's favourite model @entity116 , the brainchild of @entity117 , features 16 line drawings of the @entity120 model who has taken the world by storm			1
it featuries @entity39 in all her gorgeous guises : hot @entity39 , sophisticated @entity126 , kooky @entity127 , geeky @entity128 , catwalk @entity129 , cheeky tomboy @entity131 , and many more			0
