by @entity0 - parkinson last updated at 12:13 pm on 20th december 2011 prisons were not ready for the sudden influx of inmates that occurred following the summer riots , a report by inspectors has found			1
with 60 inmates arriving in the space of a week , @entity8 in @entity9 struggled to cope with the demand and fights regularly broke out with those already being held there concerned that rioters had ' destroyed their turf '			1
many of those involved in the disturbances had also been abandoned by their families who had even considered moving home , shamed by their actions and affected by their communities ' reactions			2
the number of young offenders put on suicide watch increased by 200 per cent while many experienced gangs and violence for the first time			1
@entity8 struggled to cope after the riots as 60 prisoners arrived in a week - the normal number that is jailed there in a month inmates baulked at scenes played out on television inside the prisons by lashing out at those they saw as being responsible for putting their families at risk			1
staff at the jail found that there was ' no central strategy to manage the unprecedented numbers of new arrivals and transfers , including those they were expecting as further arrests were made '			0
in one instance there was a ' copycat riot ' in the young adults ' gym at @entity8 but a repeat in the unit holding those under 18 ' did not materialise '			1
the report by prison inspectors said : ' young people already in the prison had negative perceptions of those involved in the riots as they felt that they were responsible for the transfer of their friends to other prisons			1
' they had seen their home areas attacked on television and were worried about family and friends there			2
' footage of the destruction sparked anger among inmates who then vented their frustration on those they saw responsible for causing the damage many young offenders were ostracised by their families after seeing the reaction of their communities and some have even said they want to move because of the fallout existing prisoners were moved to prevent disturbances , but ' there had been attacks on those involved in the riots and this was now the primary cause of fights ' , the inspectors said			1
' young people on different units had formed themselves into gangs and there had been fights between units			1
' this included those who had not been involved in gangs in the community before and who had become part of the unit gang to protect themselves			0
' young people who had not previously experienced violence were witnessing it first hand in custody and some had become more vulnerable as a result			2
' although there had been no actual self - harming , the number of open @entity117 ( assessment , care in custody and teamwork assessments ) had increased by 200 per cent due to staff concerns for new young people			2
' as those involved in the riots were dealt with swiftly by the courts , the number of new arrivals at @entity8 hit 60 in a week , the same number it would typically expect in a whole month , the inspectors said			1
with increasing pressure on space , 70 people had to be moved out of the institution within a week with as few as two hours notice			0
most of them were transferred 200 miles away to @entity141 in @entity142 and many did not have time to let their families know about the move			0
staff also had little information about new arrivals and the ' huge increase of movement across the whole of the under - 18 estate ' affected both newcomers and the settled population			0
chief inspector @entity155 said that while @entity8 ' coped well ' overall , it was important for all institutions to ' work effectively with young people held in custody for the first time to ensure they do not become caught in a gang and criminal culture '			1
the @entity163 also received reports that children in prisons had been ' advised to walk around in pairs so they were not on the landing on their own '			0
@entity169 , the group 's chief executive , said : ' other prisoners said that the rioters had ' destroyed their turf ' and beatings had been going on all day			0
similar to emergency services tackling the disturbances and fires , prison staff were forced to ' make it up as they went along ' in the struggle to cope with the pressure ' one of our lawyers said it was difficult to hear on the telephone as screaming and shouting could be heard in the background			0
' she added : ' the government made it clear that those involved in the riots should expect to go to jail			0
' obeying political pressure to respond quickly and punitively , the courts over-reacted to the civil disturbances of the summer and sent hundreds of children to prison , putting them at risk , blighting their life chances , and stretching the prison system to its limit			1
chief prisons inspector @entity155 said that @entity8 ' coped well ' but other institutions should work to prevent young people becoming caught in gang culture ' it is shocking that there was no coherent strategy from central government for dealing with the massive influx of children sent into custody			1
@entity146 were forced to make it up as they went along			0
' @entity217 , director of the @entity219 's out of trouble programme , said : ' @entity221 was inundated with new arrivals as a result of the riots and this report details the strain on the system			0
' the system did cope , just about , but the report begs the question as to whether so many under 18 - year - olds needed to be locked up on remand in the wake of the riots			0
' a @entity236 spokesman said : ' we have a zero - tolerance policy towards violence in prisons			2
' those suspected or convicted of rioting received the same treatment as all other prisoners , and any incidents which have taken place have been minor			0
' any incidents should be seen in the context of the age and challenging nature of the population at @entity8			2
' @entity252 , chief executive of the @entity253 , added that inspectors found that @entity8 was ' fundamentally safe , with good self - harm and violence management , positive staff - prisoner relationships , effective drug interventions and good healthcare and resettlement provision '			1
' @entity8 has a very challenging population and i am pleased that the work being undertaken to address gang issues has been recognised , ' he said			2
' at the time of the inspection @entity8 was adapting to cope with a higher sentenced population of young people than previously			1
the governor will use the chief inspector 's report to develop the regime to match the young people 's needs and improve activity provision			0

inspectors noted a sharp rise in young offenders put on suicide watch following disturbances
many young offenders introduced to gangs and violence for the first time
inmates attacked youths they saw as being responsible for putting loved ones at risk and for forcing the relocation of their *companions*
@entity8 took on 60 inmates in a week - the normal amount it takes in over a month
