by @entity0 ' unwelcome advances ' : an independent report leaked today makes serious allegations about the sexual conduct of mp @entity4 @entity5 was last night struggling to contain another sex scandal after his party tried to suppress ‘ credible ’ allegations of misconduct by an mp			1
the @entity10 finally suspended @entity4 yesterday , more than three years after a vulnerable constituent first complained about him			1
incredibly , mr @entity5 acted only after an independent report by a @entity13 , who found prima facie evidence that the 67 - year - old mp was guilty of ‘ serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour ’ , was leaked online			1
this is despite the fact the complainant , known only as @entity21 or @entity22 , wrote to mr @entity5 in march 2011 about her frustrations over the case			0
her letter said : ‘ i am also deeply upset that as the deputy prime minister and leader of the @entity10 , you have done nothing to oust this man from politics			2
he can not be trusted and he is a liability to women , the public and also your party			0
his conduct should be a matter for you as leader of the party			0
’ the report into mr @entity4 ’s conduct was given to the party last august			1
he had resigned the @entity10 whip last june after the woman threatened to sue			1
but the report was never published and on tuesday the @entity10 - controlled council in @entity48 – where mr @entity4 is also a councillor – voted to keep it under wraps			1
it emerged only when political internet blogger ‘ @entity53 ’ published it yesterday			0
in his report , @entity55 also says he could see no reason why it should not be published straight away			0
last night critics asked how it was possible that the party leadership had done nothing to discipline the married mp for so long – and had not even asked to see the report into one of their mps until yesterday			1
coming at the height of the furore engulfing @entity68 – who is refusing to apologise for a string of sex allegations by female party members – the case will ingrain the idea that mr @entity5 has little or no grip on his party			1
' you are special and sexy ' : @entity10 mp @entity4 allegedly sent a string of lewd texts containing filthy comments to woman , who had mental health problems and had previously been sexually abused incredibly , @entity5 acted only after an independent report by a @entity13 , who found prima facie evidence that the 67 - year - old mp was guilty of ' serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour ' , was leaked online the allegations against mr @entity4 , mp for @entity88 , are even more serious than those against @entity68			1
the alleged victim accused the father of two – who was more than 30 years her senior – of exposing himself in front of her , ‘ forcibly ’ kissing her until she had red marks on her arms , and begging her to perform sex acts upon him			1
mr @entity97 found that the vulnerable constituent – who had a personality disorder and had been sexually abused as a child – had also been bombarded by lewd text messages from mr @entity4 for months			1
on a later occasion he allegedly took her to the @entity105 where he ‘ kept topping her wine up ’ and ‘ ran his fingers through her hair ’			0
he bought her gifts , including a @entity105 teddy bear – which he sprayed with his aftershave and asked her to sleep with			0
when @entity21 was told that the police were not going to prosecute she said she felt like shooting herself			0
mr @entity4 was arrested in 2010 in connection with the allegations , but @entity119 decided there was not enough evidence to mount a criminal case			1
a civil case is pending in the @entity124			0
@entity125 , which commissioned the report , said its legal advice was that it could not publish the report until that case had been completed			2
but mr @entity97 said that , in his view , there was no reason why it should not be published			0
@entity134 : councillors on @entity48 's @entity10 - run council voted to keep the report ( pictured ) secret last night but it has made its way into the public domain via the @entity53 website today it is not the first time mr @entity4 has been embroiled in a sex scandal			1
four years ago an affair with researcher @entity145 was exposed in addition , a @entity10 spokesman said last night that the leadership had not even seen the @entity13 ’s report until yesterday			1
‘ given @entity55 ’s conclusions in his report , we have immediately suspended @entity4 ’s membership of the party , ’ he said			1
@entity156 mp @entity155 said : ‘ the @entity10 are descending into chaos			2
this case once again sends out an appalling message to women			0
@entity5 needs to stop dithering and show some leadership			0
’ it is not the first time mr @entity4 has been embroiled in a sex scandal			1
four years ago an affair with @entity166 researcher @entity145 , 27 , was exposed			0
she worked for him in the @entity105 and was accused of spying for @entity167 – but the allegations were never proved			0
the damning report into the latest scandal includes interviews with @entity22 about the events of early 2010 , when she was aged 35			2
the alleged victim , who gave evidence under oath , said of mr @entity4 : ‘ he forcibly kissed me			1
he grabbed my arms and he stuck his tongue down my throat			2
’ on another occasion , she said , mr @entity4 undid his belt and exposed himself			2
‘ i said , “ put it away , i think you are disgusting and you need some help ; you have a sexual problem ” , ’ the report said			2
the alleged victim told the @entity13 : ‘ that was the worst time , this really affected me			2
’ party split : @entity68 denies any wrongdoing and has refused to apologise for the distress caused to women who allege that they were groped by him in his conclusions , mr @entity97 said : ‘ making full allowances for the disclosed mental history of @entity22 , i have no doubt that she has provided before me compelling prima facie evidence of serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour carried out towards her by mr @entity4			1
‘ i am of the clear view that her account if credible and merits both compassion and respect			0
’ mr @entity97 called on the authorities to decide whether criminal proceedings should start again , adding : ‘ the time for equivocation has ended			0
these matters should have been addressed definitively a long time ago in the interests of @entity22 and mr @entity4			0
’ mr @entity4 is also a city councillor in @entity48 and still represents the @entity10 at @entity215 claims : @entity4 ( pictured ) has repeatedly denied claims he sent sexy texts and made sexual advances towards a troubled female constituent the woman had originally contacted mr @entity4 over a dispute about noisy neighbours			1
she told the solicitor that mr @entity4 knew she had mental health problems			0
she had been abused ‘ in a family setting ’ between the ages of ten and 14 , raped at 18 , and had suffered from eating disorders since the age of 14			0
last night mr @entity97 said he was disappointed that only a redacted version of the report had come to light , adding : ‘ it would be better for my full report to be published sooner rather than later , ’ he said			2
before the suspension was announced , a spokesman for mr @entity4 said : ‘ these matters have twice been looked at by the police , first in 2010 , and in conjunction with the @entity240 , they have found that there is no case for mr @entity4 to answer and have taken no further action			1
‘ as this is an ongoing legal case , it not appropriate for @entity4 to give a running commentary			2
’ a @entity10 source last night denied the report had been suppressed			2
‘ @entity48 councillors were advised by the city solicitors that the report should not be published until the outcome of the civil action , ’ he said			0
‘ this was not a political decision			0
