by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 10:56 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 21:15 est , 5 march 2013 @entity2 has launched a revolutionary safety device that scans for cyclists and automatically brakes if a collision is imminent			1
the @entity7 car firm says the camera and radar - guided technology , which is being introduced into cars from may , could save hundreds of lives			1
the system comprises a radar scanner in the grille , a camera fitted in front of the rear - view mirror , and an onboard computer			1
it allows the car to identify cyclists who swerve into its path and reacts by slamming on the brakes			2
this is how @entity2 's amazing new technology works : the new cyclist detector system comprises a radar scanner set into the car ’s grille , a camera fitted in front of the rear - view mirror , and a computerised central control unit			1
the radar measures the distance to any suspicious object while the camera compares its shape and size against an electronic visual catalogue of thousands of images – including bicycles and cyclists			2
it can even differentiate between a pedal cyclist and a motor cyclist			0
@entity2 spokesman @entity65 said : ’ the high - resolution camera makes it possible to spot the moving pattern of pedestrians and cyclists			1
‘ the radar scans the area in front of the car			0
once it has detected an object , the camera confirms that it is a vehicle , a bicycle or a pedestrian and it " keeps an eye " on the object			0
‘ if the situation becomes critical and in collision - course with the object a red warning flashes in the windscreen and the car activates full braking power automatically			0
’ the system is called ‘ cyclist detection with full auto brake ’ – but has already been dubbed ’ cycle scan ’ - and was unveiled at the @entity88 in @entity89 today			2
danger : should a cyclist suddenly swerve , warning lights flash up on the windscreen ( shown on the left ) detection : pedestrians , cyclists and parked vehicles are all recognisable to the car because it compares them to thousands of images stored on its computer hard - drive @entity107 , senior vice president of marketing , sales and customer service at @entity110 , said it was ‘ a major advance ’ in road safety			0
all @entity2 cars equipped with pedestrian detection will now also be fitted with cyclist detection , he said			2
@entity2 cited accident data showing that around half of all cyclists killed in @entity121 traffic have collided with a car – a situation which the firm ’s new technology aims to counter-act			2
@entity2 , which sold 40,000 new cars in the @entity127 last year , said it will be available ’ from mid may in 2013 ’ in the @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity131 and @entity133 models as part of a more general ‘ driver support ’ safety package costing £ 800			1
a @entity2 spokesman said the system was designed to deal with scenarios such as ‘ a cyclist in the same lane swerving out in front of the car ’ , someone wobbling and not paying attention , or taking evasive action to avoid a pot - hole			1
safety : the package will be available in models including the @entity129 from may @entity2 stressed that the automatic brakes kick in only ‘ as a last resort ’ and that the driver otherwise retains ultimate control of the car and brakes			1
deaths and serious injuries among cyclists , children and pedestrians have soared on @entity127 ’s roads amid a summer of sporting spectaculars , school holidays and unseasonal wet weather			0
road safety experts say the @entity167 and a ‘ @entity169 ’ effect may have contributed to an alarming rise in child pedestrian and cyclist casualties last summer as youngsters sought to emulate their sporting heroes			0
last year , 122 cyclists were killed on @entity127 roads - the highest toll for five years			0
previous studies have found that the number of cyclists killed rises during recessions as more people take to their bikes to save money on running a car .			0

*gadget* warns drivers and applies brakes if the motorist fails to take action
radar in the grille is used in *conjunction* with camera in rear - view mirror
the system will be available in various @entity2 models from may
