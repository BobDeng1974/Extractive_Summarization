by @entity0 a wave of sheep mutilations in @entity3 , @entity4 over the past few months lead some residents and @entity7 groups to believe the killers may be from another planet			1
@entity10 and @entity11 lost 21 of their @entity12 since july and lost their last two less than a week ago			2
at first @entity11 thought that people were stealing the sheep for food , but the surgical precision and the graphic nature of the mutilations led him to believe otherwise			1
the mutilations piqued the curiosity of @entity21 , a popular member of the @entity22 , after he ’d read an article about the killings in an @entity26 article published in the @entity27			1
warning : @entity28 a dead female mutilated @entity12 sheep shown here is one of the 21 missing or killed sheep on the @entity11 farm @entity21 , the organization ’s section director , traveled from @entity36 to @entity11 ' residence to launch an investigation on tuesday			1
he plans to help the @entity40 sheriff ’s department solve the puzzle			2
@entity42 , a senior field investigator of the @entity22 planned to arrive on wednesday to help @entity21 with the investigation			1
police investigators believe the incidents may be related to satanic worship			0
‘ i ca n't think of a reason aside from rituals or malicious mischievousness for the mutilations , ’ @entity40 investigator @entity47 told the @entity26			1
recently , @entity11 has been losing an animal every five days and usually a few at a time			2
‘ at first i lost four little ones , ’ said @entity11			1
a little over a week ago a male sheep was found by the pond castrated			2
his cause of death is unknown			0
precisely removed sheep testicles are found laying in the grass at the @entity62 's farm after three female sheep went missing , @entity11 found two of them			2
‘ one of them was found in the pond , stabbed behind the ear			2
another had had its female sexual organs removed			0
’ the organs sat next to the dead sheep			1
the removal of the organs looked very surgical to @entity11 and it was curious to him as to why no trace of evidence was found next to any of the sheep			2
‘ it does n't look like a coyote got at them , ’ he says			1
‘ i think that a person is doing this			2
’ also , as to how someone stole the sheep from the property was perplexing			1
@entity12 sheep weigh 60 to 75 pounds , not an easy weight to stealthily carry off property , @entity11 says			2
‘ it 's not just kids			2
whoever is doing this knows what they are doing , ’ @entity11 continued			0
laser - like incisions , no traces of blood , and absence of tracks are characteristics of the mutilations that @entity21 has investigated			0
@entity21 has not commented on what he believes is killing and stealing the sheep			0
@entity21 , a member of the @entity22 , is helping the police department investigate the mutilation ‘ it 's an ongoing investigation so i ca n't talk too much about it , ’ said @entity21			1
‘ we need to find out what is getting in the property			0
’ ‘ it could be a man , a wolf , an @entity114 or anything , ’ he continued			1
‘ we 're trying to lean towards earthly things			0
’ in the early 1900s a similar mutilation was discovered			0
a horse was found dead with no traces of blood and nothing but the bone above the neck , @entity21 said			0
an examination of the horse showed that its nervous system had been removed with what looked like a laser			0
a bag with unknown metal tools that could have been a ‘ laser gun ’ was found 50 feet away from the horse			1
warning : @entity134 a castrated male sheep is mysteriously dead with no trace of evidence as to how it was killed according to @entity141 , @entity140 races have inhabited or visited the @entity142 for hundreds of thousands of years			0
@entity143 believes a human is behind the killings			0
‘ it was n't a wild animal , which would tear the meat , ’ @entity143 says			1
‘ this was too clean to be an animal			1
whoever did this knew what they were doing			0
’ @entity154 worked in law enforcement for 23 years , 18 of those years as a constable with @entity157 4			1
since retiring , he has tended to his animals			0
he is starting to believe he may have offended someone and that someone is seeking revenge by stealing his animals			0
‘ i worked hard to not make enemies while i was on the job , ’ @entity11 said			1
he had an emotional connection to the animals and deeply mourns their loss			0
‘ it hurts me severely , ’ he said			1
@entity11 puts the cost of the animals he has lost at around $ 1,250 , and the investigation is being treated by the county as a case of theft of livestock and mutilation			0
@entity143 mentioned that there was a group of self - proclaimed satanic worshipers in the area in the late 70 ’s who were responsible for cattle mutilations			0
however , @entity143 does n’t think that group is linked to these killings			0
‘ this could be someone who has nothing else to do but hurt animals for kicks , ’ he says			1
the @entity190 is offering $ 2,500 for information regarding the sheep mutilations			2
they are asking that anyone in the area who has had animals go missing or killed should contact law enforcement officials as soon as possible			1
@entity12 , like the one 's pictured here , weigh 60 to 70 pounds and would be difficult to forcibly remove from the @entity11 ' property			0

@entity22 helps law enforcement investigate the precise mutilations of 21 sheep
‘ this was too clean to be an animal . whoever did this knew what they were doing , ’ said a sheriff
