after a blistering start to his career at @entity3 , @entity0 is looking less and less like a £ 60million player			1
the @entity6 record transfer fee spent by @entity7 immediately put the @entity8 under pressure to perform following his move from @entity12 - something he appeared to relish at the start of the season			1
but now he looks lost and is struggling to find the form he showed during his last season in @entity17			0
@entity7 need more from their most expensive player ever			2
@entity0 ( right ) , pictured in action against @entity20 , has struggled to find his best form this year @entity22 is n't the only star to have failed to immediately justify a huge price - tag , although others have taken on the responsibility with aplomb			1
with that in mind , @entity28 takes a look at how players signed for £ 50m and more fared after sealing their big - money moves			1
@entity35 - @entity34 to @entity12 £ 86m the most expensive footballer of all time , @entity35 has endured a mixed spell in @entity17 since swapping @entity39 for @entity12 in the summer of 2013			1
the @entity40 slotted into @entity42 's star - studded team with ease in his first season , scoring in the @entity45 and @entity47 finals to win over @entity12 fans			2
but this season , despite netting 12 goals in @entity52 and @entity53 , the former @entity50 youngster has been subjected to boos from some sections of the @entity57 faithful			2
verdict : hit @entity35 , pictured in action against @entity61 , has endured a mixed response since joining @entity12 @entity63 - @entity7 to @entity12 £ 80m undoubtedly the biggest success story on our list , @entity63 can almost be regarded as a bargain given his goal - scoring prowess since leaving @entity3 in 2009			1
the @entity71 star netted his 290th goal in his 281st appearance against @entity61 on saturday , taking him to 29 league goals for the season			0
with one @entity52 title , a @entity45 crown and the @entity78 among the trophies to his name already , he could well help @entity12 win more come may			2
verdict : hit @entity63 has been a huge success since leaving @entity7 for @entity12 in 2009 @entity83 - @entity82 to @entity84 £ 75m the main man at @entity82 before his summer move to @entity84 , @entity83 has found goals harder to come by alongside superstars @entity89 and @entity90			1
often forced to play wide rather than through the middle , the @entity91 has found the back of the net just four times in 15 @entity52 outings since returning from a four - month ban for biting			0
the 27 - year - old has eight assists in the top flight and another couple of goals in the @entity45 but is yet to recapture the form which almost helped @entity105 ' men to the @entity107 title last term			2
verdict : @entity109 @entity83 , pictured being denied by @entity111 keeper @entity110 , has only scored four @entity52 goals @entity113 to @entity12 £ 63m signed on the back of a brilliant @entity78 campaign with @entity117 , @entity114 has adjusted to life at @entity12 with relative ease			1
comfortable out wide or behind striker @entity122 , the former @entity121 man has scored eight league goals in his debut season to help @entity42 's men to the top of the table			0
currently out injured for two months with a broken foot , @entity114 will hope to continue to justify his sizeable fee when he returns for the title run - in			2
verdict : hit @entity12 's @entity114 was signed for £ 63m after a brilliant @entity78 with @entity117 @entity0 - @entity12 to @entity7 £ 60m between august 30 and december 31 @entity22 scored three goals , recorded six assists and created 31 chances in 12 appearances			1
in his six games since @entity137 , he is yet to score , has two assists and has laid on just 11 chances			0
the @entity8 's dip in form is worrying given the way he took to the @entity107 at the start of the season , although it should be noted that @entity7 , as a team , are yet to hit top gear			1
there is more to come from the @entity150 midfielder , but he can not allow this slump to continue			0
verdict : @entity109 @entity22 ( right ) looks dejected during @entity7 's 2 - 1 defeat at @entity20 on saturday afternoon @entity154 - @entity153 to @entity84 £ 59m when @entity84 paid @entity153 £ 40m plus @entity156 , it was a gamble			2
unfortunately for @entity158 , it did n't pay off			0
the @entity161 international scored goals in the 2009 - 10 season after moving to @entity17 but problems with his manager and the culture of the club meant that he moved to @entity168 on loan just a year after joining			0
a permanent transfer for around half what they paid for him followed in 2011			0
verdict : miss @entity154 joined @entity84 for the equivalent of £ 59m but left on loan after just one season @entity178 - @entity168 to @entity12 £ 56m one of the best players in the world when @entity12 brought him to @entity17 , @entity178 never really managed to exhibit the talent which won him the @entity182 in 2007			1
injury troubles and poor form restricted him to just 120 appearances over four seasons , a return which did little to justify his then world - record fee			1
a free transfer back to @entity168 followed in 2013 , before a move to soon - to - be @entity193 side @entity192			0
still only 32 , the @entity195 magician never quite fulfilled his enormous potential			0
verdict : miss @entity195 midfielder @entity178 ( right ) failed to justify his £ 56m fee during an injury - hit four years with @entity12 @entity199 to @entity198 £ 55m a major investment by @entity202 - owned @entity198 in the summer of 2013 , @entity200 has continued to establish himself as one of the most dangerous strikers in world football since leaving @entity206 for @entity207			1
the @entity91 bagged 16 goals in @entity209 during his debut campaign but only has eight so far this term , having often been shunted into a wide role to accommodate @entity154			0
the scorer of @entity198 's goal against @entity215 in the @entity45 last week , @entity200 continues to attract interest from clubs in @entity218			2
a similarly massive fee would be needed to take him away from @entity220			0
verdict : @entity109 @entity200 has been played out of position at @entity198 despite costing the club £ 55m @entity224 - @entity223 to @entity225 £ 51m currently struggling for form on loan at @entity7 , @entity224 hit a more than respectable nine goals in his first 17 games for @entity225 before suffering a season - ending injury			1
he began this season well , scoring twice in three games , but was then shipped out to @entity3 as the @entity225 continued to cut costs after spending big in recent years			2
the former @entity223 striker looks certain to leave his parent club permanently this summer , although they hope to recoup much of the £ 51m they paid for him			0
verdict : miss @entity224 managed just half a season with @entity225 before suffering a serious knee injury in early 2014 @entity240 - @entity82 to @entity215 £ 50m perhaps the least successful big - money signing on our list , @entity240 ' four - and - a - half years at @entity241 were a huge disappointment after his goal - filled spell at @entity82			1
the @entity248 scored 45 times in 172 appearances for the @entity251 but was a shadow of the player who dominated opposition defences under @entity255 at @entity256			0
a transfer to @entity168 followed in january , before a long - term loan to former club @entity223 gave him a much - needed fresh start			0
verdict : miss @entity240 , pictured reacting to a missed chance , left @entity215 after a disappointing spell in @entity39 @entity263 - @entity215 to @entity198 £ 50m not many people could believe it when @entity198 agreed to pay @entity215 £ 50m for @entity263 , a defender with an unfortunate habit of making decisive mistakes			1
the colourful @entity195 made the switch to @entity220 last summer and has been in solid form for @entity270 's side since , winning 79 per cent of his headers and completing 90 per cent of his passes			0
despite some good performances in @entity209 , @entity263 still managed to allow @entity274 to score the opening goal when @entity215 visited @entity276 in the @entity45 last week			0
verdict : @entity109 @entity263 ( right ) , pictured in action against his former club @entity215 , was a surprise £ 50m buy by @entity198			1

@entity0 is in poor form after a *promising* start at @entity7
@entity7 spent £ 60m to sign him from @entity12 last summer
the @entity8 is one of 11 players in history to have cost £ 50m or more
@entity63 - the £ 80m man - has been a huge hit at the @entity57
@entity240 and @entity178 failed to justify huge price - tags in recent years
the jury is still out on @entity263 , @entity83 and @entity200
