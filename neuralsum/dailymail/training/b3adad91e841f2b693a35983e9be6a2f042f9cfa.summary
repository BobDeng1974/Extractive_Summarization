a huge hump - backed ' ostrich ' dinosaur , taller than a @entity3 bus and with arms eight feet long tipped with razor sharp claws , has been modelled based on @entity7 fossils			1
two almost complete skeletons - which included the remains of digested fish in the belly of one - have helped build an accurate picture of the lifestyle of mysterious @entity14			1
for almost 50 years it was known only from two gigantic arms but the new collection of fossils have now been pieced together			0
now a pair of new skeletons unearthed in @entity7 have allowed them to assemble the missing pieces of the puzzle			2
shown is a 3d model of the creature analyses indicate @entity34 was the largest member of the ornithomimosaurs - a group of dinosaurs that bore a superficial resemblance to modern ostriches , dr @entity31 and colleagues report in @entity40			1
the creature is estimated to have measured an incredible 36 feet ( 11 metres ) long and stood over 16 feet ( 4.9 metres ) tall , and it would have have weighed about 7 tons ( 6,350kg )			1
a giant salt water crocodile that lived 160 million years ago was as long as of a double - decker bus , scientists from the @entity43 claim			2
the terrifying creature roamed the ocean feasting on marine animals such as turtles and may even have eaten dinosaurs , according to a new study			0
the fearsome prehistoric reptile measured more than 30 feet ( nine metres ) long			1
fresh research into @entity54 reveals key details of how and where it lived			0
experts say three different species could be found in @entity60 and a fourth in @entity61			0
the skeletons , discovered in two different quarries in 2006 and 2009 , shows that @entity64 , roamed @entity65 70 million years ago			2
the 2006 specimen of @entity34 was found at quarry @entity67 ; the 2009 specimen at @entity70			1
both of these are quarries are in the @entity75 in the @entity77 desert , a rock unit dated to 70 million years ago			1
the dinosaur has unique features not seen in other ornithomimosaurs , such as an elongated toothless snout flaring out at the sides and a humped back			2
it also had an enormous lower jaw more like theropods such as @entity86			0
vertebrae from the two new specimens also showed long , flat neural spines jutted upwards from the middle of the dinosaur 's back to create a sloping , bony hump			1
look familar ? analyses indicate @entity34 ( illustrated right ) was the largest member of the ornithomimosaurs - a group of dinosaurs that bore a superficial resemblance to modern ostriches ( left ) , dr @entity31 and colleagues report in @entity40 , and it roamed @entity65 70 million years ago no other ornithomimosaur has been found with such a structure , but other sorts of unrelated dinosaurs - such as the croc - snouted spinosaurus and the shovel - billed @entity108 - have been found with similar ' sails '			2
fleshy ' sails ' could have helped dinosaurs regulate their body temperature but other scientists believe the bones supported something more like a bison 's thick hump			0
the researchers said @entity34 would have lived by rivers with a duck - like bill probably helping it forage for food at the bottom of streams			0
@entity124 and flattened bones under its claws could have prevented it from sinking on wet ground			0
fish remains were found among what seems to be stomach contents but the @entity34 skeletons also have features associated with plant consumption - suggesting the creature was an omnivore			1
over a thousand small , polished stones were discovered around the belly region of one of the fossils			0
dr @entity31 described these as gastroliths - or stomach stones - that the dinosaur intentionally swallowed to grind up tough plant material			1
the 2006 specimen of @entity34 was found at quarry @entity67 ; the 2009 specimen at @entity70			2
both of these are quarries in the @entity75 in the @entity77 desert ( shown ) , a rock unit dated to 70 million years ago			1
pictured are some of the stomach contents found over a thousand small , polished stones were also discovered around the belly region of one of the fossils ( shown )			2
dr @entity31 described these as gastroliths - or stomach stones - that the dinosaur intentionally swallowed to grind up tough plant material fish remains were found ( shown ) among what seems to be stomach contents but the @entity34 skeletons also have features associated with plant consumption - suggesting the creature was an omnivore the strange beast was originally identified in 1965 from a couple of forelimbs eight feet ( 2.4m ) in length - the record holder for the longest known arms of a bipedal animal			1
its latin name means ' unusual horrible hand			0
' dr @entity31 , of the @entity178 in @entity179 said : ' these fossils provide new insights into the creatures and reveal unexpected features that could not have been predicted from the partial skeletons originally discovered in 1965			0
' the discovery of the original specimen almost half a century ago suggested this was an unusual dinosaur - but did not prepare us for how distinctive @entity34 is - a true cautionary tale in predicting body forms from partial skeletons even for animals in which the relationships are known			0

a dinosaur called @entity200 has been *recreated* in 3d
the model was constructed based on bones found in 2006 and 2009
these were found in the @entity75 of the @entity77 desert in @entity7
latest discoveries revealed it had razor sharp claws and a hump - back
the creature is estimated to have measured 36 ft ( 11 metres ) long
the fossils were also found with fish remains still in their stomach
