by @entity0 , deputy political editor a group of 37 mps have put their names to a report which says packaging should remain on cigarettes to help struggling small businesses plans to sell cigarettes in plain packaging should be dropped , a group of influential @entity13 mps demand today			1
the @entity15 group of backbenchers , which includes many rising stars from the new intake , today calls for the plans to be abandoned in order to prevent small shops being hit by a fall in tobacco sales or a rise in tobacco smuggling			2
some 37 mps have put their names to a report published today on ways to promote ‘ the growth of @entity30 ’s small businesses ’ which demands a cull of damaging regulations			1
the report calls on ministers to ‘ drop proposals for plan packaging tobacco products ’			2
the prime minister appeared to kill off plans to impose plain packaging in july , saying further evidence was needed to show whether it would be effective			2
but in a surprise move , public health minister @entity42 announced last week that paediatrician sir @entity44 will carry out a rapid review of the evidence by march - meaning plain packs could be brought in by the time of the 2015 election			1
the review was ordered in response to evidence emerging from @entity53 , which last year became the first country to introduce plain packaging			0
the change of heart was welcomed by health campaigners , but tobacco companies said a ban lead to an increase in smuggling and counterfeit products			0
the @entity63 of @entity64 warned that introducing plain packs is unnecessary regulation that will hurt small businesses			1
those who have signed the paper include the chairman of the treasury select committee @entity71 , @entity72 ’s envoy to the @entity74 community @entity75 and leading backbenchers like @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80			0
@entity72 appeared to rule out the possibility of plain packets last july but a recent u-turn means they could be on shelves by the next election in 2015 one of the mps involved told the @entity87 : ‘ this is a an unnecessary burden for business			1
lots of businesses sell tobacco			0
it could be a problem for small businesses			1
’ their report was written before the government u-turn but @entity99 , who coordinates the activities of the group , said it would be published unchanged today			2
he called on the @entity44 review to consider the risks to business , as well as those of public health			0
@entity99 mp , said : ‘ i look forward to seeing sir @entity44 ’s conclusions and would also hope that the potential consequences for businesses feature in the government ’s decision making			0
‘ this is a complex and technical area of policy and the government is absolutely right to take the time to consider all the available evidence rather than to rush towards legislating as the @entity118 opposition is demanding			0

group of @entity64 have backed report calling for regulation to be dropped
they say dropping sales from plain packets will harm small businesses
