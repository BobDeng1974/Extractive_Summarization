by @entity0 published : 08:23 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 12:11 est , 16 january 2014 twenty years of bungled dentistry have left a man with crowns held in place by superglue , rotting teeth and a lifelong fear of having his mouth touched by medics			1
botched : @entity11 was left with a mouth of infected teeth and shoddy implants so bad was the damage , a dentist who examined marketing manager @entity11 's mouth described it as looking as if ' a bomb had gone off			1
' mr @entity11 , 38 , from @entity21 , first had surgery at the age of 18 to remove his wisdom teeth but was left with infected gums after a dentist snapped his teeth off at the root instead of extracting them			1
five years later , his front teeth were knocked out after a windsurfing accident but surgeons botched the repairs leaving him with ' tombstone - like ' front teeth in a different shade from his remaining molars			0
mr @entity11 , a marketing manager , chose to have his operations done privately in an attempt to ensure a perfect result but was left horrified by the damage			2
' when you go to someone who 's a professional dentist , private , and they 're charging an awful lot of money for it , you do n't doubt them , ' he confessed			2
' i looked in the mirror [ after the operation ] , expecting you would n't be able to tell it was implanted teeth , and i was like : " you got the colour completely wrong ! " ' but mr @entity11 's problems did n't end there			2
thanks to the infection caused by the botched wisdom tooth operation , more teeth were rotting and dentists told him that the only way to repair the damage was by giving him crowns			0
miserable : despite paying £ 8,000 , he was given crowns so shoddy he had to use glue to keep them in infection : an operation to remove wisdom teeth left him with infected molars and gums once again the procedure was bungled and his crowns fell out less than 24 hours after they were inserted			1
shockingly , when he complained to the dentist , mr @entity11 was told to stick them back in himself using superglue			1
thanks to years of shoddy treatments , the marketing manager was left low on confidence and embarrassed by his gappy smile			1
even his wedding day in 2012 was marred by his lack of teeth with mr @entity11 forced to keep his mouth closed all day in case one of the crowns fell out			2
fearful : thanks to his experiences , mr @entity11 has been left terrified of visiting the dentist improved : mr @entity11 has since had all of his teeth removed and replaced with correctly fitted implants ' i had the tooth super-glued in for the wedding but it meant i could only manage a close - mouthed smile , ' he reveals			1
@entity99 adds : ' when i first met him , he had a bright , beaming smile , but now , even when he is happy , he does n't show it			0
' in his mind , he feels he 's grotesque , and i 'd like him to be back how he was when he first met him			0
' but restoring his old smile means facing up to the prospect of 12 hours in the dentists ' chair - not something mr @entity11 is entirely comfortable with			2
during an appearance on @entity110 documentary , botched up bodies , he said : ' it 's a scary thought having more dental work done but it 's a worse thought to have teeth like this and suppressing my smile for the rest of my life			0
' since then , mr @entity11 has faced his fears and had all of his teeth removed and replaced with correctly fitted implants , but says he remains angry that despite spending £ 8,000 on dentistry , he was left disfigured			1
he is , however , relieved and happy to finally have his smile back			0
' the confidence is back , ' he reveals			0
' @entity99 loves how much i can now smile at her			0
it 's awesome , absolutely awesome ! ' @entity128 , tonight at 10pm on @entity110			0

@entity11 , 38 , from @entity21 was left almost *toothless*
dentist told him to use superglue to keep shoddy crowns in
had paid £ 8,000 for private treatment in a bid to avoid *disaster*
confidence was left *severely* dented and was *afraid* to smile
