but the @entity1 hit back , claiming mr @entity4 himself had asked officials to examine ways to curb access to benefits			1
@entity4 , campaigning in @entity23 , @entity24 today , has hit back at claims the @entity26 have a secret plan to cut child benefit conservatives angrily denied the specific proposals set out in the document revealed by the @entity1 but they remain under pressure to spell out how they will making savings from the benefits bill			1
according to @entity7 , the unimplemented @entity37 proposals included : the clash is the worst row between the two former coalition partners and will raise serious doubts about whether they could work together again , if the @entity26 fall short of a majority			1
conservatives angrily denied the specific proposals set out in the document revealed by mr @entity7			2
but they remain under pressure to spell out how they will making savings from the benefits bill			2
@entity37 chancellor @entity49 has promised to cut £ 12billion from the welfare bill after the election , but has repeatedly refused to say where the axe will fall			1
@entity1 leader @entity53 expressed outrage that the @entity26 could not be ' bothered ' to come clean about their plans			1
the @entity1 have vowed to block the plan as the price of any future coalition deal after may 7			2
mr @entity7 , who served as chief secretary for the @entity60 , has now released details of benefit cuts put to the @entity63 of senior ministers , which included him , @entity1 leader @entity53 , prime minister @entity4 and mr @entity49			1
he said he was lifting the lid on the internal coalition discussions because his former government colleagues were ' trying to con the @entity69 people by keeping their planned cuts secret until after the election '			1
@entity1 leader @entity53 told @entity73 's @entity72 that he backed mr @entity7 's decision to disclose details of confidential coalition discussions @entity77 has claimed the @entity26 have a ' nasty streak ' as he warned workers had been hit hard by the coalition he served in			1
the business secretary claimed the @entity37 would resurrect plans to allow bosses to ' fire at will '			0
he told @entity85 : ' they have an unfinished agenda			0
' there is a very nasty streak [ in the @entity37 ]			0
they are not all nasty as individuals			0
' i have worked with them for five years			0
some of them are perfectly decent , moderate people			0
' but he warned the @entity26 would ' chisel away ' at workers ' rights			0
the @entity1 revealed that in june 2012 , the @entity63 was sent a document called ' @entity99 ' produced by officials working for @entity102 @entity101			2
mr @entity7 said the previously dropped plans - including limiting @entity12 and @entity104 to two children at a cost of £ 3,500 for a family of three - were a clear signal of where the axe would fall			1
but he was forced to admit that many of the claims set out in today 's document had been made public - and rejected by the @entity26 - in the past			2
he told @entity115 's today programme : ' there are lots of ideas that have been doing the rounds for years , so i think it 's not credible for the @entity37 to say they do not know what they 're going to do			0
' if they are proposing £ 12billion of welfare savings without knowing what they 're going to do , that is highly reckless			1
' equally , if they do know what they want to do and they 're not telling the @entity69 people , that is deceitful			0
' and that does frustrate me because i think that this is one of the issues that in the last seven days of the election campaign people would expect the @entity37 to come clean about			0
' mr @entity53 backed mr @entity7 's decision to disclose details of confidential coalition discussions saying the @entity37 needed to say where their planned benefits cuts would fall			1
' i share @entity7 's intense frustration verging on anger that the @entity37 think it is okay a week before an election to say that they are going to take the equivalent of £ 1,500 off eight million of the most vulnerable families in this country and they ca n't even be bothered to spell out exactly what their plans involve , ' he said on an @entity73 phone - in			1
but the @entity37 dismissed the claim as ' desperate stuff ' from the @entity1 and insisted the proposals were ' definitely not our policy '			2
mr @entity49 told @entity158 : ' well this is a three year old document of policy options that was commissioned by the chief secretary himself			0
' we have not put into practice any of these options			0
we do n't support them			0
we did n't support them			0
we do n't support them in the future			0
' labour leader @entity168 , pictured in @entity169 today , said the future of child benefit and tax credits is ' on the ballot paper next week ' @entity4 will today pledge to cut taxes for the young as he warns @entity177 would ' reach into your pay packet ' by raising them			1
young people have been the biggest winners from the increases in the personal allowance since 2010 , according to new figures , with five million under - 30s gaining an average of £ 70 a month each from being taken out of income tax			1
a further 500,000 will gain from the extension of the policy after the election			0
the announcement is part of a wider offer to young voters today			0
this includes a target to cut youth unemployment to the lowest level in the @entity202 group of nations			0
with just a week to go until polling stations open across the @entity69 on may 7 , mr @entity4 told the @entity205 it was ' time to throw caution to the winds , let rip and tell people what you really think '			0
the prime minister - who has in recent days deployed a more energetic approach after criticism of a lacklustre pitch to the electorate - said : ' i think we will get there			0
but the reason it is taking time is , quite rightly , people want to have a good look and a good think			0
' @entity37 culture secretary @entity225 told @entity226 : ' this is just a desperate attempt by the @entity1 to try to move their position in the polls , but it 's not going to work because these proposals were never proposed or supported by the prime minister or the chancellor and they would never be supported by the prime minister or the chancellor			2
' our principles are very clear when it comes to welfare : it is there to help people , especially to help people get back into work , but also to support the disabled , to support pensioners - and those principles will not change			1
' mr @entity7 's revelations came as @entity248 reported growing dissent in @entity1 ranks over the possibility of entering a second power - sharing deal with the @entity37 if the @entity252 fails to produce a clear winner			1
@entity53 has based his campaign around the premise that his party would be a restraining influence on either of the main parties			0
but the newspaper said a number of - mostly unnamed - parliamentarians were increasingly hostile to the prospect of a @entity37 tie - up , which would have to be approved by a special party conference			0
mr @entity7 said : ' for five years i won battle after battle to stop the @entity26 veering off to the right with ideological cuts , and it 's been worth it to get the economy back on track while ensuring a fairer society			1
' the coalition has delivered savings in a fair way , but the @entity26 now want to balance the books off the backs of ordinary working families and the most vulnerable in society			1
' the @entity26 have turned their backs on the plan delivered in coalition government			2
instead they want to cut £ 1,500 for eight million households , singling out middle and low - income families to bear the burden - and asking nothing from the best off			1
' it 's clear from our time in government that the @entity26 ' target will be slashing support for families			0
i 'm lifting the lid on this now because the @entity37 are trying to con the @entity69 people by keeping their planned cuts secret until after the election			1
' they now ask the @entity69 people to trust them when they make unfunded pledges on health and tax , yet wo n't tell us how they will cut welfare for millions of families to pay for their plans			1
they may give with one hand , but they will take away twice as much with the other			0
' the @entity1 will take a fairer approach , cutting less than the conservatives and borrowing less than @entity177 , to deliver a stronger economy and fairer society with opportunity for everyone			2
' labour leader @entity168 also seized on the @entity314 ahead of an event in @entity24 , he said : ' today we 've learnt that child benefit and tax credits are on the ballot paper next week			1
' the @entity26 have drawn up plans to take thousands of pounds away from millions of families			2
' the @entity26 ' secret plan has been revealed			2
' and they will put it into practice in just seven days ' time if they get the chance			0
' it 's the final proof that working families ca n't afford five years of the @entity26			2
