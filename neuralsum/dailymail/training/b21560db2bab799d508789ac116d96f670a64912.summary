the judge leading the probe into media behaviour threatened to quit after he was publicly criticised by a cabinet minister , senior @entity1 sources claimed last night			1
@entity6 phoned @entity8 ’s most senior mandarin and demanded that education secretary @entity9 – who claimed the inquiry had created a ‘ chilling atmosphere ’ towards freedom of speech – should be gagged			1
in the angry call to cabinet secretary sir @entity14 , the judge claimed that if ministers were not silenced , his inquiry , set up to investigate phone - hacking by @entity19 ’s newspapers , would be rendered worthless			1
he also summoned mr @entity9 to give evidence to the inquiry to explain himself			1
an alarmed sir @entity14 informed @entity23 of the judge ’s ultimatum			1
lord justice @entity6 threatened to quit after he was publicly criticised by a cabinet minister mr @entity6 , @entity27 , left , threatened to quit the inquiry after his work was criticised by education secretary @entity9 who said the inquiry had brought a ' chilling atmosphere around freedom of expression ' government insiders say they were convinced @entity6 was prepared to resign in protest unless ministers stopped passing comment on his inquiry			1
‘ our clear impression was that he was spitting tacks with @entity9 and was ready to resign unless the minister was told to shut up , ’ said one source			1
other insiders insisted @entity6 did not threaten to walk away from the inquiry , but they confirmed the phone call to sir @entity14 – and that @entity6 said ministers such as mr @entity9 should not speak out			1
‘ @entity6 said that if this was going to continue with cabinet ministers offering opinions while the inquiry was in its early days , he would have to question whether the inquiry had any value , bearing in mind it was using public money , ’ said the source			1
‘ he did not threaten to resign			1
’ a spokesman for the inquiry said : ‘ @entity6 is conducting a judicial inquiry and , in that capacity , will not comment on prospective press stories outside the formal proceedings of the inquiry			1
’ the spokesman refused to make any further comment			2
@entity65 , mr @entity9 and the @entity66 , where sir @entity14 is based , all refused to comment			1
the extraordinary row erupted after mr @entity9 gave a speech to political journalists at a @entity71 luncheon on february 21			1
he argued that the @entity72 had created a ‘ chilling atmosphere ’ towards freedom of expression and any attempt to tighten regulation of newspapers could result in ‘ a cure worse than the original disease ’			1
mr @entity9 was concerned about groups with vested interests ‘ fettering ’ the press			1
he conceded that illegal activity conducted by some sections of the media had to be ‘ vigorously policed ’ but said ministers should not be panicked into over-reacting to the phone - hacking scandal			1
he appeared to have riled @entity6 with pointed comments accusing ‘ the @entity93 , the great and the good and judges ’ of joining forces with celebrities who wanted to muzzle a free press			1
mr @entity9 said : ‘ when an undoubted wrong has been done there ’s a desire to find a judge , a civil servant , a representative of the great and good , inevitably a figure from the @entity93 , to inquire into what went wrong and to make recommendations about what might be put right			1
‘ it ’s a natural thing for politicians to do but sometimes there are dangers associated with it			1
’ he added that there was a danger of regulation being imposed by ‘ judges , celebrities , and the @entity93			2
all of whom have an interest in taking over from the press as arbiters of what a free press should be			2
’ an enraged @entity6 immediately instructed his officials to compile a full report of mr @entity9 ’s comments			1
and within 24 hours , he phoned sir @entity14 to protest			1
the cabinet secretary informed @entity126 and mr @entity9			1
cabinet sources say neither mr @entity9 nor other ministers were ordered to keep quiet about the @entity72			1
however , few have spoken out since his indignant phone call			2
but the bitter feud between mr @entity9 and @entity6 was evident when the @entity9 , a former journalist at @entity132 , owned by mr @entity19 , gave evidence at the inquiry on may 29			1
a defiant mr @entity9 repeated the arguments he made at the @entity71 , almost word for word , to the evident annoyance of @entity6			1
the judge insisted new rules were needed to curb media excesses , while mr @entity9 strongly defended mr @entity19 and said journalists were ‘ exercising a precious liberty ’ when they wrote articles			1
a clearly irritated @entity6 snapped : ‘ mr @entity9 , i do not need to be told about the importance of freedom of speech , i really do n’t			1
’ he was ‘ concerned ’ by mr @entity9 ’s view that ‘ unacceptable ’ behaviour has ‘ to be accepted because of the right of freedom of speech ’			1
but mr @entity9 stuck to his guns , insisting attempts to stamp out wrongdoing could make things worse			1
by @entity154 , @entity27 @entity154 we ’re definitely in this together ’			2
these words were revealed to the @entity72 this week as part of a text message sent by @entity160 to @entity23 on the eve of his conference speech in october 2009			1
various meanings have been proposed , but one could not have been intended			2
it is that the digital age has transformed not just the medium but also the message and without due care we will all end up ‘ in it together ’			2
thoughts and identity become public property			2
for some , there is empowerment , for others humiliation			2
for some , means of change , for others the opportunity for exploitation			2
in 1968 , @entity180 observed : ‘ in the future everyone will be world - famous for 15 minutes			2
’ note , not just the obvious people , but ‘ everyone ’			2
the advent of social networking , texting , tweeting , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , blogs and e-petitions has created an information highway beyond measure , along which millions of individuals are transported every second			2
all brought to you in handy pocket - sized devices			2
we are on the verge of living in a ‘ screen culture ’ , a transposition of the ‘ private ’ into the ‘ public ’			2
a byproduct of this invasion is unverifiable material			0
critical thinking is in danger of being swamped			0
this has to be addressed by education to circumvent misunderstandings			1
jurors in criminal trials are warned not to surf the net			1
it would incur a significant risk of untested material influencing the verdict			0
the point we ’ve reached requires precaution by everyone			0
@entity222 is a treasured necessity for the security and development of the individual			0
the @entity228 states : ‘ no one should be subject to arbitrary and unlawful interference with his privacy			0
’ this has been consistently reinforced by judicial pronouncements			0
yet what has happened , surreptitiously and rapidly , is a widespread voluntary , unrecognised surrender			0
in the rush to be in constant touch with every event and feeling , to be a global villager , we have sacrificed who we are to scrutiny			0
the price is details of your identity and consumer preferences			0
to get a bus pass , a store card or any product online , they want your birthmarks			0
the small print offers you to other organisations unless you spot the tiny opt - out box			0
at the same time as corporations are assembling dossiers of personal information , the @entity257 is proposing greater powers of intrusion			0
last week , the home secretary @entity263 and @entity265 commissioner @entity264 announced the need to access more details of phone calls , texts and emails			2
more than 95 per cent of major crime investigations involve covert techniques			0
none of this sits comfortably with the @entity276 vow after the last election ‘ to reverse the substantial erosion of civil liberties under @entity280 ’			0
the mantra of ‘ national security ’ trips easily off the tongue of authorities whose record for responsible governance is being seriously questioned at the @entity72			0
the close links between senior @entity1 figures , senior @entity265 officers and the @entity19 machine hardly restores confidence in a system of checks and balances			0
more appropriate might be the concepts of manipulation and exploitation			0
there is another , converse side to this story			0
the power of the new technology can not be contained and can not be controlled			0
it is a people ’s revolution of astonishing force			0
the ongoing @entity309 , a struggle against oppression and censorship , has been facilitated by the use of unofficial blogs , tweets and film			0
on our own streets , the unlawful activities of police can be captured on mobile phones which give the lie to the official version of events			0
@entity325 corporate activities can also be exposed			0
it is a form of accountability and democratisation which has been sorely lacking			0
there is a clear tension between these forces			0
a resolution can only be entertained if we redefine the idea of ‘ privacy ’			0
it is up to the individual to police his or her identity			0
it is no coincidence that we are in the middle of an economic and environmental meltdown derived from a shadow economy in which the truth was hidden until collapse was unavoidable			0
it is a wake - up call of astronomic proportions			0
the moral high ground has to be reclaimed by the pursuit of principle and transparency			0
new forms of governance must be formulated that enshrine accountability			0
i doubt this can be delivered through the ballot box , but it might through the mobile phone .			0
