@entity0 certainly caused some controversy with his comments on @entity3 on sunday night by saying he would have gone in two - footed on @entity4 for showboating			1
i think it was a tongue - in - cheek comment more than anything , but perhaps ‘ robust challenge ’ would have been a better choice of words … there ’s no doubt , though , that if you are on the receiving end of some unnecessary trickery , it winds you up			1
the red mist can descend and you instantly think : ‘ this player ’s taking the p * * *			2
’ i found that more often than not things like this would happen near the touchline			2
partly because of the type of flair players who play on the wing but largely due to the proximity of the crowd			2
@entity4 looks one way but passes another during the build up to his spectacular goal the @entity33 midfielder used the same move a number of times during @entity38 's 3 - 2 win against @entity39 @entity0 made the comments on @entity3 , but later claimed it was ' tongue in cheek ' showboating and tricks are done to impress the fans and when you ’re on the touchline , you are right next to them – players love playing to the crowd			1
as soon as a trick comes off , you can sense the reaction straightaway			2
you get this ‘ wahey ’ from the terraces and it can feel as if everyone is laughing at you			0
if players started doing step - overs in front of me , i tried to home in the ball			2
my thoughts would be : ‘ right , you ’re taking the mickey here so now you ’re going to feel the full force of a big challenge			0
’ it was a gamble because , if they nick it past you , you end up looking foolish but it was always a good feeling if you won the ball and were able to give your opponent a bit of a clump at the same time			0
i would go in with one foot – using two feet always felt unnatural to me – but that did n’t mean you could n’t be strong to make sure they stopped			0
@entity4 celebrates his goal while @entity76 rushes over to congratulate him former @entity78 goalkeeper @entity77 dived too late to keep out @entity4 's perfectly executed strike it ’s especially bad if the player is only doing tricks for themselves			1
when @entity83 was a young @entity84 player , he was ridiculed for his self - indulgent skills but now he uses that talent to win games			1
@entity4 had a good game against @entity39 but the feints were designed to dummy his opponent so he could release a pass – it was done with the team in mind			1
perhaps he went a bit over the top but i do n’t think it was too disrespectful			0
he was playing with great confidence in a game where everything was coming off for him			0
whether he would have done that against @entity102 the previous week is another matter			0
but every player can be tempted into showing off occasionally			0
when @entity38 won the league against @entity106 , even i had a go at a few step - overs			1
i thought if the crowd saw me pulling off a few tricks then they knew it must be a good day ! if you overstep the line , though , and over-indulge , you ’ve only got yourself to blame if you ’re on the end of a few strong challenges			0
@entity83 was criticised for trying too much during his early days at @entity84			1

@entity0 said he would have two - footed @entity38 *playmaker* @entity4 if he had attempted a no - look pass in training
@entity4 was in impressive form during @entity38 's 3 - 2 win against @entity39
