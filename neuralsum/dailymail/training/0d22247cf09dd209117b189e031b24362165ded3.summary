@entity1 mountaineer @entity0 has defended his decision to take sir @entity4 ’s son @entity3 to the summit of the @entity6 , despite the 29 - year - old old falling ill with severe altitude sickness			1
the 40 - year - old managed to guide @entity3 to the top of the mountain during a recent charity climb , even though @entity4 began struggling to walk and had difficulties breathing as they closed in on the peak			1
the pair battled on before @entity0 finally called for a helicopter to airlift @entity3 off the mountain after they had both reached the top			1
scroll down for for video sir @entity4 's son @entity3 was taken seriously ill with extreme altitude sickness as he neared the summit of the @entity6 in @entity21 during a recent charity climb @entity1 mountaineer @entity0 radioed for a helicopter to take @entity24 back down the mountain @entity0 , who has reached the summit of @entity27 11 times during his illustrious climbing career , said he expects criticism for his decision not to send @entity3 back down the mountain when the effects of the altitude first began to show			1
‘ i have no doubt that people will say it was a poor mountaineering decision to take @entity3 to the top , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ but honestly , the effects of the altitude took hold really quickly – only half an hour or 40 minutes at most			2
‘ when we got around 200 meters from the top , @entity3 started to slow up			1
i started to notice this as we approached the shoulder of the mountain			2
@entity24 was struggling to walk and breathe as the group closed in on the peak of the 4,478m peak the group managed to help @entity3 ( yellow jacket , middle ) conquer the final 200m before he was airlifted down the mountain ‘ @entity3 said to me “ i do n’t feel good , i feel nauseous ”			1
as soon as someone says “ nauseous ” at high altitude you start thinking “ this could be altitude ”			2
' it was a pretty rapid deterioration after that			2
he started to dry heave , the colour began to drain from his face and he slowed right down			2
‘ @entity3 is a very emotional young man and the emotion may have been a little overwhelming for him			1
he was in tears , he thought the opportunity to summit was evaporating before his eyes			2
‘ we gave him a pep talk and perhaps told him that he had an obligation to those around him ! ‘ but i knew by this time that to get @entity3 down safely was going to be a mammoth task , bordering on the impossible			1
i was already thinking that we would have to call a rescue in			0
there was no way we were getting the boy down			0
’ at this stage @entity4 was struggling to breathe properly and on the verge of losing consciousness			0
‘ but we were so close by this stage , and by the time he got to the top he just collapsed and was heaving his guts up , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ emotionally he crumbled at this point			0
' it was the fulfilment of a dream , a challenge			0
it was a remarkable day , a triumph on every level			0
’ remarkably , mountaineer @entity0 managed to help @entity3 reach the summit before radioing for a helicopter mr @entity0 , who is the founder of mountain and ski guide company @entity89 , was recruited by @entity24 to join the @entity93 challenge which has been raising money @entity94 , a charity founded by six friends including @entity24 , @entity97 , and princess @entity98			1
the charity raises funds to help young people develop life skills			0
the event involved travelling from @entity104 ’s @entity103 to the top of the @entity6 in @entity21			2
the different legs of the journey saw the group complete three marathons from @entity104 to @entity110 , rowing the @entity111 , cycling 900km to @entity113 before finally hiking seven days across the @entity114 in a bid to reach the top of the 4,478m peak			1
@entity24 ( centre ) with @entity119 ( left ) and @entity120 ( right ) at summit mr @entity0 said that the ascent of the @entity6 had been hit by adverse weather conditions meaning the group almost did n’t attempt the ascent at all			1
he said : ‘ nobody had been summiting and the local guides were n’t even entertaining an attempt on the mountain			2
but it is hard to put into words just how much energy and team spirit there was			0
i ’ve got a reputation , along with the other guides working with me , for pulling off the impossible			0
‘ we waited several days for the conditions to improve before leaving camp at 3am			0
things were against us all the way up			0
the @entity143 hunt near the base of the mountain was shut so we had to start our ascent 600m lower down the mountain			1
‘ we still thought that if we got to the @entity147 hut about half way up that would be a good result			0
the group 's ascent to the summit of the @entity6 was undertaken as part of the @entity155 ‘ but people were moving fast and efficiently and we started making progress upwards			1
when we got half way up confidence just started to grow and we felt we were going to summit			2
’ @entity161 - based mr @entity0 currently holds the record for the most amount of @entity27 summits by a @entity166 climber , having reached the peak 11 times			1
in 2012 he took one of the 1924 @entity170 awarded to the @entity171 to the summit of the 8,848m @entity174 peak , resulting in @entity175 personally thanking @entity0 and his team for ‘ kick starting the @entity177 ’			1
in 2009 he successfully led explorer sir @entity179 to the top of the mountain while in 2013 he and his climbing partner @entity182 became the first people to attain the @entity184 ; summiting @entity27 , @entity186 and @entity187 in the space of just seven days , a feat previously thought impossible			1
@entity89 founder mr @entity0 currently holds the record for the most amount of @entity27 summits by a @entity166 climber , having reached the peak 11 times he now says he hopes to mount another record - breaking expedition next year by summiting the world ’s three highest mountains - @entity27 , @entity194 and @entity195 - within three months			1
it means he will have climbed a total of almost 60,000ft in 12 weeks if he is successful			0
the only people to have summited all three mountains have previously taken five years to complete the challenge			0
he added : ‘ we are calling it the “ @entity214 ”			0
it will be a real test of human endurance and a huge mental challenge			0
i think it will take me to some pretty dark places while i ’m on the mountain			2
and such a huge amount of time away from home where i have a young family , that is going to be really testing			0
’ mr @entity0 has also revealed that a wealthy client once offered him a six - figure sum to take them to the summit of @entity27 , although he declined the offer after fearing that the individual would not make it to the top			1
he said : ‘ my hit rate on @entity27 is way up there			1
the average success rate for most people going up there is around 50 per cent			0
my success rate is about 82 per cent			0
i do n’t want to jeopardise that by taking someone up there with an open cheque book and no climbing experience			0
i ’m not interested in that			0
‘ the buzz words at the moment are “ adventure tourism ”			0
some people are guilty of promoting @entity27 as the ultimate adventure tourist spot			1
i tried to promote @entity27 as the ultimate adventure			1
‘ it has nothing to do with tourism			0
i want people to go to the mountain and look at it with the same eyes that i look at it with			2
i want them to fall in love with it like i have			0
‘ of course i have been approached by wealthy people			0
there is one person who does spring to mind			0
' he was very keen to climb @entity27			1
it would have been expensive , put it that way , because i work one - on - one			2
i was once misquoted as saying " if you want to climb @entity27 with me , it ’s £ 500,000 "			1
' that was a bit over the top			2
but i suppose it depends on how much you are willing to put on fulfilling your dream , and some people have more financial clout than others			0
’ @entity0 works for @entity89 - @entity268			1

mountain guide @entity0 helped @entity3 reach the top of the 4,478m peak
pair were just 200m from the top when @entity3 began to feel nauseous
@entity0 said the group 's ascent of the mountain had been hit with *problems*
@entity282 has reached @entity27 summit a record - breaking 11 times
