@entity0 pulled off the prank of the transfer window , as he hinted at a move away from promotion - chasing @entity4 on deadline day - only to later insist it was just a joke			1
the 26 - year - old , who has been in impressive form for @entity10 's side so far this season , gave some @entity4 fans a bit of a shock after a series of tweets from his @entity18 account indicated he was on his way to @entity21 outfit @entity20			1
@entity0 started it off by posting ' it 's snowing bad in @entity20 ' , prompting some panicked fans to reply back in less than favourable terms to the midfielder			2
@entity0 scores a disallowed goal for @entity4 in their @entity28 win against @entity29 the 26 - year - old has been in good form for @entity4 so far this season although some realised that @entity0 was having a laugh , he continued with the joke later tweeting ' sorry pal @ liammoore93 took your spot in the changing room ' and ' @entity40 is bigger than i thought '			0
he eventually put some worried @entity4 fans out of their misery tweeting : ' hahahah only joking lets get promoted this season we can do it # @entity47 '			0
with @entity20 currently fighting against relegation in the @entity21 and @entity4 flying high near the top of the @entity53 - just one point off the joint leaders @entity48 and @entity50 - such move would have come as a surprise , anyway .			0

@entity0 *teased* fans that he was moving to @entity20 on deadline day
the @entity4 midfielder made out he was on the move on @entity18
some worried fans were far from happy with @entity0 's tweets
however , @entity0 's tweets were all in good jest
he later tweeted that he was only joking and that he is looking *forward* to the rest of the season as @entity4 look to earn promotion
