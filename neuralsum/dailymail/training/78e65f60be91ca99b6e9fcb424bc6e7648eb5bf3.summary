by @entity0 from the boring status updates to the relentless sharing of cat videos and baby photos , there are many reasons to ' unfriend ' people on @entity8			0
but the most common reason for culling a virtual friendship is polarising opinions about religion and politics , according to a new study			2
adults are most likely to unfriend acquaintances from school , which could be because people ’s views change – and become more extreme in some cases – over the years so they have less in common than they did			2
friendship culled : the study suggests that adults are most likely to unfriend acquaintances from high school , which could be because people 's views change ' and become more extreme in some cases - over the years so they have less in common than they did ‘ the most common reason for unfriending someone from high school is that the person posted polarising comments often about religion or politics , ' said @entity35 , a doctoral student in computer science at the @entity37 , @entity38			1
unsurprisingly , ‘ the other big reason for unfriending was frequent , uninteresting posts , ’ he said			2
his first study examined unfriending behaviours on the social network and involved a survey of 1,077 people on @entity47			2
the study found that the top five kinds of people are unfriended are : high school friends , ‘ other ’ , a friend of a friend , work colleagues and ‘ common interest friends			1
’ mr @entity35 said : ‘ we found that people often unfriend co-workers for their actions in the real world rather than anything they post on @entity8			1
’ the most common reason for unfriending someone from high school is that the person posted polarising comments often about religion or politics , said @entity35 , of the @entity37 , @entity38			1
people 's reactions to being unfriended ( illustrated ) ranged from upset to surprised , the study found the study found that the top five kinds of people are unfriended are : one reason he believes high school friends are top targets for unfriending is that their political and religious beliefs may not have been as strong when they were younger			1
and if those beliefs have grown more strident over time , it becomes easier to offend others			0
‘ your high school friends may not know your current political or religious beliefs and you may be quite vocal about them … one thing about social media is that online disagreements escalate much more quickly , ’ he said			1
the second of his studies looked at the emotional impact of being unfriended and he discovered that the most common responses were : ‘ i was surprised ’ , ‘ it bothered me , ’ ‘ i was amused ’ and ‘ i felt sad ’			1
mr @entity35 said : ‘ the strongest predictor is how close you were at the peak of your friendship when the unfriending happened			2
you may be more bothered and saddened if your best friend unfriends you			0
’ one less friend : the second study looked at the emotional impact of being unfriended and said that the most common responses ranged from amusement to @entity100 study found that people were more likely to be emotionally affected by the action is they were close friends or closely monitored their list of friends the study unsurprisingly found that people were more likely to be emotionally affected by the action if they were close friends or closely monitored their list of friends			1
the work suggests that people would be less negatively affected if difficulties were discussed between friends before the unfriending and if the person unfriended talked about it with others after the unfriending			1
the research found that unfriending happens more often to friends who were once close than to those who are acquaintances			1
‘ despite the preponderance of weak ties throughout online social networks , these findings help to place unfriending within the greater context of relationship dissolution , ’ the study said			1
the two studies were published in the 47th @entity130 and anyone who would like to be involved in his next wave of research investigating why people leave @entity8 , can take an anonymous survey			0
@entity8 can boost our political leanings dramatically - and cause us to ignore friends we do n't agree with , researchers have claimed			0
a @entity141 study found users tend to stick in their own circles and become more polarised			1
it also claimed @entity8 's own algorithms should be tweaked to make more partisan stories appear			0
' people are mainly friends with those who share similar values and interests			0
they tend to interact with them the most , a phenomenon called homophily , ' said @entity153 , the @entity154 student who led the study			0
' but that means they rarely interact with the few friends with differing opinions			0
as a result , they are n’t exposed to opposing viewpoints			0
' people who think the majority of their friends have differing opinions than their own engage less on @entity8 , the researchers discovered			2
for those who choose to stay logged in and politically active , the research found that most tend to stick in their own circles , ignore those on the other side and become more polarised			0
the study also found @entity8 may be partly to blame - as its algorithms learn what we like			0
ms @entity153 suggests that the social media site should sprinkle in a few status updates on both sides of political issues .			0

study found the top five kinds of people who are unfriended are : school friends , other , a friend of a friend , colleagues and ' common interest friends '
@entity37 , @entity38 research says school friends are targets for unfriending because their political and religious beliefs have got stronger
second study discovered the most common responses to being unfriended were : ‘ i was surprised ’ , ‘ it bothered me , ’ ‘ i was amused ’ and ‘ i felt sad ’
