i had my eyes opened to the more turbulent side of @entity4 life last week when i spent a day visiting the @entity6 favela , which has n’t yet been fully pacified			1
it taught me that some of my assumptions about the struggles of the poor were wrong and showed me their anger and frustration at an inequitable society is absolutely justified			1
i got a glimpse of favela life last month when i visited @entity17 , now fully pacified and in some ways a ‘ tourism ’ favela			2
eye opener : people in the @entity17 favelas want police and government to stop kicking them out of their homes on the @entity29 - the @entity28 - the views are spectacular looking down on the city but the poverty and oppression are something else entirely			1
i spent time meeting a few different families , including that of a local graffiti artist , @entity36 , whose father died recently and whose mother is one of the local community figureheads			2
i came to @entity40 believing that the essential issue of the poor and disenfranchised was that the government were spending billions on a @entity44 when basic services were lacking for ordinary working - class people : transport , infrastructure , medical care , education			1
community : local graffiti artist @entity36 ( right ) outside his house in the @entity54 favela but it ’s a much more complex issue			1
the poor of @entity40 are n’t looking for a handout , they want the police , local municipality and government to stop disenfranchising them further and kicking them out of their homes			1
they want to be left alone			0
the story among those i met on @entity6 is they ’re having their homes taken off them while , as they see it , the government move in , smarten the place up and then cash in on real estate deals			1
turning a poverty and crime - stricken area into a estate of small new apartments and houses on a hillside with wonderful views is all well and good , with a spanking new lift to take you from bottom to top			0
care : the community vibe is very strong with lots of different races living alongside each other one of the great privileges of being here is spending time with lots of football people such as @entity91			2
i was especially impressed with the @entity94 manager @entity93			0
he talks with such passion and is an exceptional manager			0
could he be @entity98 boss one day ? but not if you ’re being forced out for someone else to take advantage			0
and not if you ca n’t afford to use the lift , which is essentially for tourists			2
imagine if that happened in @entity106 , the police arriving , banging down doors and telling you that you now have to live in a different area of town , one even grimmer than the area you live in with even poorer sewerage			0
no wonder they ’re upset			0
yet the community vibe is very strong and i ’ve found it remarkable the variation of people , black , white , brown , mixed race , every shade , living alongside each other			0
together : @entity98 players watch @entity126 dancers in front of the @entity128 during their time in @entity40 good times : @entity130 ( right ) poses with @entity131 legend @entity91			1
