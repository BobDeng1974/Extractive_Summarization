by @entity0 published : 04:43 est , 27 april 2012 updated : 04:45 est , 27 april 2012 some of the secrets of @entity3 ’s pock - marked moon @entity4 have been revealed , with @entity6 scientists discovering that it is actually remarkably planet - like			1
thanks to data beamed back from the agency ’s @entity12 probe , which has been loitering nearby , astronomers now know that the moon is far rounder than previously thought			2
what ’s more , they believe that the moon may have actually been warm for tens of millions of years – and probably hosted water			1
rock on : @entity4 's true nature is revealed in startling clarity in this mosaic of two images taken during @entity12 's flyby on june 11 , 2004 , from 20,200 miles away scientists had their first close - up look at @entity4 when @entity12 began exploring the @entity3 system in 2004			1
using data from multiple spacecraft instruments and a computer model of the moon 's chemistry , geophysics and geology , scientists found @entity4 was a so - called planetesimal , or remnant planetary building block			1
‘ unlike primitive bodies such as comets , @entity4 appears to have actively evolved for a time before it stalled out , ’ said @entity36 , a planetary scientist at @entity6 's @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity39			1
‘ objects like @entity4 are thought to have condensed very quickly			1
hence , they represent building blocks of planets			2
they give scientists clues about what conditions were like around the time of the birth of planets and their moons			2
’ @entity12 images suggest @entity4 originated in the far - off @entity54 , the region of ancient , icy , rocky bodies beyond @entity58 's orbit			1
rounding out the facts : this panel of images shows the nearly spherical shape of @entity4 @entity3 lies 890 million miles from the @entity63 on average			1
it has a diameter of 74,897 miles			2
it ’s a very very cold planet , with an average temperature of @entity69 ( -220f )			2
it ’s made of liquid and solid hydrogen and helium and is so light it would float on water			0
it ’s most famous for its rings , which were first discovered in the 17th - century			0
they extend 46,000 miles out and have a total diameter of almost 170,000 miles			0
it has 60 moons – more than any other planet in the solar system , bar @entity84			0
one of them , @entity87 , is the second largest in the solar system and actually has an atmosphere – composed mainly of nitrogen			0
@entity3 is extremely stormy , with winds gusting at 1,000mph at the equator			0
data show @entity4 was spherical and hot early in its history , and has denser rock - rich material concentrated near its centre			1
its average density is about the same as @entity102 , another object in the @entity54			0
@entity4 likely was captured by @entity3 's gravity when it somehow got close to the giant planet			1
@entity3 is surrounded by a cloud of irregular moons that circle the planet in orbits tilted from @entity3 's orbit around the sun , the so - called equatorial plane			0
@entity4 is the largest of these irregular moons and also has the distinction of orbiting backward in relation to the other moons			1
@entity3 's large moons appear to have formed from gas and dust orbiting in the planet 's equatorial plane			0
these moons currently orbit @entity3 in that same plane			0
‘ by combining @entity12 data with modeling techniques previously applied to other solar system bodies , we 've been able to go back in time and clarify why it is so different from the rest of the @entity3 system , ’ said @entity125 , a co-author on the study and a @entity12 team member at @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130			0
analyses suggest that @entity4 was born within the first three million years of the birth of the solar system , which occurred 4.5 billion years ago			1
the moon may originally have been porous but appears to have collapsed in on itself as it warmed up			0
@entity4 developed a density 40 per cent higher than the average inner @entity3 moon			1
objects of @entity4 's size have long been thought to form as ‘ potato - shaped ’ bodies and remained that way over their lifetimes			1
if such an object formed early enough in the solar system 's history , it could have harboured the kinds of radioactive material that would produce substantial heat over a short timescale			0
this would warm the interior and reshape the moon			2
stunning : @entity3 's rings stretch 46,000 miles into space ‘ from the shape seen in @entity12 images and modelling the likely cratering history , we were able to see that @entity4 started with a nearly spherical shape , rather than being an irregular shape later smoothed into a sphere by impacts , ’ said co-author @entity165 , a @entity12 team member at @entity128			2
@entity4 likely stayed warm for tens of millions of years before freezing up			1
the study suggests the heat also would have enabled the moon to host liquid water at one time			0
this could explain the signature of water - rich material on @entity4 's surface previously detected by @entity12			2
the new study also is consistent with the idea that several hundred million years after @entity4 cooled , the moon drifted toward the inner solar system in a solar - system - wide rearrangement			1
@entity4 was large enough to survive this turbulence			2
more than 60 moons are known to orbit @entity3 , varying drastically in shape , size , surface age and origin			0
scientists using both ground - based observatories and @entity12 's cameras continue to search for others			0
the findings appear in the april issue of the @entity202 .			0

@entity4 was probably warm for tens of millions of years before it froze up
