a new report says there has been ‘ a rise in poverty in working families and a fall in workless and retired families '			1
file picture one and a half million working families have been plunged into poverty since 2004 - the year that eastern @entity12 migration began to accelerate , a major new study has found			1
the majority of the people now living below the poverty line are not dependent on benefits but come from homes where at least one person has a job , the study reveals			2
almost half of the families who now count as poor have not one but two people in work , it said			2
the large - scale study carried out for the @entity27 found the fall of working families into poverty does not date from the beginning of the recession in 2008			1
instead , it reported that the remorseless rise of poverty among people who work for a living began in 2004			1
although the report does not attribute this to migration , the figure began to rise in the same year @entity42 ’s government opened the gates to allow migrants from @entity12 countries the right to work freely in @entity47			1
since then the eastern @entity12 population has shot up to around a million people , while high numbers of immigrants have continued to arrive from outside @entity12			1
many of the new arrivals have been competing with lower - skilled workers in the existing population for low - paid jobs			0
the report from @entity27 – which is headed by @entity58 , a @entity59 adviser when @entity60 was prime minister – said there had been ‘ a dramatic change in who is most at risk of poverty compared to 10 years ago			2
’ it said there are ‘ more people in poverty living in working families , meaning as many are now in working families as workless ones			1
’ and the report , @entity73 and @entity74 , added that there has been ‘ a rise in poverty in working families and a fall in workless and retired families			1
‘ the rise occurred mainly in the middle of the last decade , when the number of people living in low - income working families rose from 5.2 million in 2003/04 to 6.8 million in 2008/09 before falling back slightly			1
’ the majority of the people now living below the poverty line are not dependent on benefits but come from homes where at least one person has a job , the study reveals			2
file picture @entity27 also found that 2.2 million children live below the poverty line in working families , while only 1.4 million live in homes where no - one has a job			1
the foundation ’s economists said the study , which does not try to explain the rise in working poverty , ‘ does not show that immigration has caused higher poverty ’			1
they suggested that changes to the benefit system were responsible for the lapse into poverty of a million and a half working people			1
but a series of figures now points to a link between the arrival of @entity12 workers in large numbers beginning in april 2004 and the falling incomes and status of people who rely on earnings from the least skilled jobs			1
the @entity27 report said that for the bottom 10 per cent of earners , ‘ income at the 10th percentile peaked in 2004/05 , well before the country went into recession , and fell quite consistently after that			0
’ the lowest incomes have fallen by eight per cent in real terms since 2004 , it said			2
the lowest incomes have fallen by eight per cent in real terms since 2004 , according to the report			2
file picture in 2003/04 there were two million more people who were either living in homes where nobody works , or who were retired , listed as poor than people from working homes			1
however numbers were equal by 2008/09 , and by 2011/12 there were more working poor than poor without jobs , according to the study			0
the report also looked at overcrowding in both privately rented homes and those rented from local councils or state - financed housing associations			0
less than five per cent of such homes were overcrowded in 2003/04 , it found , but then numbers started rising , and topped seven per cent in state - subsised housing in 2010/11			0
the poverty measure used by @entity27 is the commonly - used relative poverty measure , which says a family is poor if they live on less than 60 per cent of median income			0
in the financial year 2012/13 , this meant £ 130 for a single adult , £ 224 for a couple without children , £ 175 for a single parent with one child , and £ 364 for a couple with two children			0
the relative measure is often criticised because it means that when average incomes fall , fewer people are said to be in poverty			0
however , it does chart accurately how different groups of people are doing compared to each other			0
since 2004 , while large numbers of working families have slipped below the poverty line , the benefit system has buoyed up people who depend on welfare			1
benefits continued to be uprated in line with inflation each year until 2011			0
however , major reforms to the benefit system , such as the introduction of tax credits and pension credit , were introduced by @entity60 at the end of the 1990s , five years before large numbers of working people began to slip into poverty			1
the @entity196 think tank said that it was no longer credible to deny the line between immigration and pressure on the incomes of lower earners			0
its chief sir @entity203 said : ‘ yet again , lobbyists seem to be in denial about the impact of a huge inflow of @entity12 migrants on the lives of some of the poorer sections of our community			1
‘ it is surely no coincidence that starting from 2004 , increases in working poverty and overcrowding in rental accommodation have gone hand in hand with increasing numbers of arrivals from the poorer parts of @entity12			1
‘ the government ’s @entity224 and academic research have already highlighted the impact on wages for the lowest paid			0
‘ as for jobs , nowhere in the @entity27 report is there a single mention of the fact that in the past 10 years the number of @entity47 - born workers increased by just 25,000 while the number of migrants in work increased by over 2 million , with nearly a million from @entity12			1
’ @entity239 , head of poverty research for the @entity27 , said that the drop of working families into poverty was linked to the introduction of tax credits by @entity60 in 1999			1
by 2004 , he said , the credits were yielding ‘ diminishing returns ’ in terms of reducing poverty			2
he said other changes to the benefits system had also changed the balance of poverty in 2004 and 2005			2
mr @entity239 said : ‘ the report shows that pay slowed around 2004 and unemployment started to rise , although pay continued to grow even for low earners , while unemployment stayed low until 2008			0
it does not show that immigration has caused higher poverty			0
’ the @entity261 found in a report on the impact of immigration in 2012 that ‘ migrants are found to increase wages at the top of the @entity47 wage distribution and to lower wages at the bottom of the distribution			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity261 said : ‘ uncontrolled , mass immigration , of the kind we saw under the last government , makes it difficult to maintain social cohesion , puts pressure on public services and forces down wages			0
' it has both economic and social consequences			0
that is why our focus remains on reducing and controlling migration at sustainable levels			0
‘ we are creating a system that is fair to @entity47 citizens and those who want to come here legitimately and contribute to our national life , but which is tough on those who flout the rules			0
since 2010 , we have reformed benefits , healthcare and housing rules to make them among the tightest in @entity12 and we continue to see an increase in the number of @entity47 citizens in work			2
’ a @entity302 spokesman said : ‘ the truth is , the percentage of people in the @entity47 in relative poverty is at its lowest level since the mid- 1980s and the number of households where no one works is the lowest since records began			2
‘ the government ’s long term economic plan is working to deliver the fastest growing economy in the @entity315 , putting more people into work than ever before , and reducing the deficit by more than a third			0

*1.5* million working families have been plunged into poverty since 2004
it is the same year that eastern @entity12 migration began to accelerate
