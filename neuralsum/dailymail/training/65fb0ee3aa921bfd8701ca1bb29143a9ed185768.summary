during the two weeks respite from chemo , @entity6 's parents started her on a different form of treatment , which has left her feeling ' awesome , ' she said			2
' i wish that the doctors would listen to me , because i live in this body and they do n't , ' she added			0
also during that time , @entity6 said she had a vision of @entity28 , flanked by two angels , who told her she was already healed , and not to be afraid			1
