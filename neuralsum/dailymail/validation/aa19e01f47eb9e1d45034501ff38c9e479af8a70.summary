@entity1 gov. @entity0 said tuesday he wants new legislation clarifying that a new religious - freedom does not allow discrimination on his desk by the end of the week			1
the @entity7 fired back hours later , calling @entity0 a ' previously defiant governor ' who has suddenly decided ' to consider a position of changing the law ' amid a ' bipartisan and even nonpolitical outcry			1
' @entity0 told reporters he has been meeting with lawmakers ' around the clock ' to address concerns that the law will allow businesses to deny services to gays and lesbians			1
' after much reflection and in consultation with the leadership of the general assembly , ' he told reporters during a press conference , ' i 've come to the conclusion that it would be helpful to move legislation this week that makes it clear that this law does not give businesses a right to deny services to anyone			2
' this piece of legislation flies in the face of the kinds of values that people all across the country strongly support , ' he said			1
that , @entity49 claimed , is why ' we 've seen the governor and other @entity1 officials in damage - control mode here			1
' the law @entity0 signed last week prohibits state laws that ' substantially burden ' a person 's ability to follow his or her religious beliefs			1
the definition of ' person ' includes religious institutions , businesses and associations			2
@entity0 says the law has been ' grossly mischaracterized ' and has put @entity1 under a harsh glare – resulting in a ' perception problem ' that he has to address			1
' i do n't believe for a minute that it was the intent of the @entity83 to create a license to discriminate , ' he said			2
' it certainly was n't my intent			0
' but , @entity0 said , he ' can appreciate that that 's become the perception , not just here in @entity1 but all across the country			1
we need to confront that			0
' supporters of the measure say it protects their ability to exercise their religious beliefs without shelving them when they enter the business marketplace			0
opponents insist it gives @entity1 residents and companies a legal loophole if they want to discriminate against gays and lesbians			1
the legal language itself does n't specifically mention gays or lesbians but the central controversy surrounding the law concerns whether or not @entity114 who run photography , catering or florist businesses should be allowed to refuse service to people who are planning same - sex weddings			1
businesses and organizations including the @entity122 – whose iconic ' @entity124 ' basketball tournament comes to @entity43 this week – have voiced concern over the effect of the law , and some states have barred government - funded travel to @entity1			1
@entity132 , the stock - car racing circuit , joined the fray on tuesday with a statement assuring fans that ' we will not embrace nor participate in exclusion or violence			1
' the organization pledged that it would welcome all fans in @entity1 and elsewhere			0
@entity143 ceo @entity142 wrote an op - ed in the @entity144 over the weekend opposing the @entity1 law and a near - identical bill pending in @entity147			1
at the @entity7 , @entity49 said it was no surprise that ' we see business leaders saying that they are reluctant to business in a state where their customers or even their employees could be subjected to greater discrimination just because of who they love			2
' @entity7 press secretary @entity49 upbraided @entity1 @entity158 on tuesday for the religious - freedom law , which bears many similarities to a federal law signed by president @entity162 in 1993 are you being served ? gay weddings are ground - zero for religious - freedom laws , as some vendors ' religious beliefs prohibit them from participating in same - sex ceremonies three states have banned taxpayer - funded travel to @entity1 this week in response to the legislation , as well as the city of @entity174 , @entity175 , and the city of @entity177 , @entity178			1
@entity179 became the first state on monday to introduce a travel ban and was followed by @entity178 and @entity182			2
@entity182 governor @entity183 today directed all state agencies to immediately ' bar any such publicly funded travel that is not essential to the enforcement of state law or public health and safety			1
' ' @entity182 has been , and will continue to be , a leader in ensuring that all @entity192 persons enjoy full and equal civil rights			0
with this action , we stand by our @entity192 family members , friends and colleagues to ensure that their rights are respected , ' he said in a statement			0
@entity179 's governor , @entity202 , accused @entity1 of ' outright bigotry			1
' ' the reality is , the governor is not a stupid man , but he ’s done stupid things			0
and signing this law and , quite frankly , promoting this law , knowing exactly what it was going to do , was an incredibly stupid thing for him to do , ' said on @entity214			0
' but even there , if you get the picture from who was around him when he signed this bill , there were three homophobic men standing alongside the governor			2
one of them who equated being gay with bestiality			0
that ’s who he invited to the signing ceremony			0
he knew exactly what he was doing , and when you see a bigot you have to call him on it			0
' the @entity238 , an evangelical group based out of @entity178 that lobbies against abortion and same - sex marriage and promotes religious liberty , came to @entity0 's defense on tuesday , saying that @entity1 has been the target of ' bullying ' and ' misinformation			1
' it said critics ' claims about the law are a ' complete falsehood			0
' @entity1 's religious freedom law is not ' about denying people a seat in a restaurant or a room at a hotel , ' the organization 's president , @entity251 , said in a statement			1
' @entity114 would never deny people these services but being forced to participate in a ceremony that violates religious beliefs is completely un-american and uncivil , ' he added			0
continuing , he said , ' we must ensure that religious business owners are not forced by the government to participate in a same - sex ceremony			0
' @entity251 said his organization would back a clarification in the law explaining that it ' does not impact non-religious goods or services			0
' best intentions : @entity0 said tuesday that it was not ' the intent of the @entity83 to create a license to discriminate , ' , and added that ' it certainly was n't my intent ' loud and proud : whether or not @entity1 's new law actually makes it legal to discriminate , gay rights groups have been promoting the idea that it does @entity0 says the backlash has been the result of a willful twisting of the law 's meaning by its opponents			1
' that 's why i think we need to focus specifically on this perception that this creates some license to discriminate , ' he said			2
the controversy has opened up the possibility that the pendulum @entity1 lawmakers pushed into motion could swing in the opposite direction			0
@entity43 mayor @entity300 , a @entity158 , said monday that state legislators should add gays to the list of groups specifically protected by the state 's civil rights law			2
and tuesday 's edition of the @entity308 included a special cover emblazoned with the words ' fix this now ' in giant letters , along with a scathing editorial			0
the newspaper 's editorial board said the uproar sparked by the law has ' done enormous harm ' to the state and potentially to its economic future			2
@entity0 seemed to be sticking to his guns on monday , writing an op - ed in @entity324 that blamed ' critics and many in the national media ' for getting their facts wrong			2
' the @entity329 reflects federal law , as well as law in 30 states nationwide , ' he wrote			0
' ' i abhor discrimination , ' @entity0 insisted			1
' i believe in the @entity335 that you should " do unto others as you would have them do unto you			0
" if i saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple , i would n’t eat there anymore			0

gov. @entity0 seemed to blink tuesday in the face of withering pressure after he signed a ' @entity346 ' bill into law
gay - rights activists complained bitterly that the law was a license for wedding vendors and other businesses to discriminate
@entity7 says it ' flies in the face of the kinds of values that people all across the country strongly support ' *&* put @entity0 in ' damage - control mode '
@entity179 's governor accused @entity1 of ' outright bigotry ' and blocked state - funded travel to the state
@entity0 insisted that the law only gives businesses a legal basis to defend themselves on religious grounds if they *'re* sued
it does n't , he said , make it legal to violate *anti-discrimination* *statutes*
that *distinction* has been lost on everyone from the @entity122 to @entity132 , with most opponents ignoring 19 other states with similar laws
