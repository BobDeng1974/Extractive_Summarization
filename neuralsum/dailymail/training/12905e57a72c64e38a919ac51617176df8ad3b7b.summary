@entity0 added their name to the list of beguiling stories at this @entity5 by defeating @entity6 in a meandering match and moving to the brink of the knock - out rounds for the first time in their history			1
@entity13 , @entity14 , and @entity15 each struck in 12 first - half minutes to sweep away their stereotype as a team set out to stifle			1
@entity19 claimed a goal back early in the second half to wobble the @entity22 but @entity23 replied and @entity25 ’s side held on to go second behind @entity26 in @entity27 video @entity0 on verge of first knockout stage appearance clinical : @entity0 's @entity13 runs past @entity6 's @entity31 after opening the scoring adoration : @entity0 players celebrate in front of their fans after their 4 - 2 @entity27 victory over @entity6 @entity38 : @entity13 runs over to celebrate with his team - mates on the bench after the first goal in 4 - 2 win bullet : @entity0 's @entity14 jumps in front of @entity6 keeper @entity45 to head in a second treble : @entity0 's @entity15 turns to celebrate after scoring their third goal placed : @entity23 ( centre ) slots the ball into the bottom corner to put @entity0 4 - 1 up consolation : @entity19 gave @entity6 hope when he scored early in the second half poacher : @entity6 's @entity57 pokes home to make it 4 - 2 against @entity0 in @entity27 @entity59 : @entity0 @entity6 4 - 4 - 2 : @entity60 3.5 ; @entity61 5.5 , @entity62 3 , @entity63 3 , @entity64 5.5 ; @entity65 6.5 , @entity66 6 , @entity67 6 ( @entity68 ’ 6 ) , @entity69 6 ( @entity70 64 ’ 6.5 ) ; @entity71 8 , @entity72 6 ( @entity73 @entity74 ’ 6.5 ) coach : @entity76 - bo 6 goals : @entity71 ' 50 , @entity66 ' 72 @entity0 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 : @entity78 7 ; @entity79 6.5 , @entity14 7 , @entity80 5.5 ( @entity81 89 ’ ) , @entity82 6 ; @entity83 6.5 , @entity84 6 ; @entity85 7.5 ( @entity86 73 ’ 6 ) , @entity23 8.5 ( @entity87 77 ’ 6 ) , @entity88 7 ; @entity89 8 coach : @entity91 8 goals : @entity13 ' 26 , @entity14 ' 28 , @entity85 ' 38 , @entity23 ' 62 @entity93 : @entity23 the 61 - year - old @entity94 has done much to alter the dour style of @entity0 ’s play since the @entity97 , which saw them fail to score including an awful 0 - 0 draw with @entity100			1
@entity0 had mustered just two goals in 11 hours and 25 minutes of @entity5 football before kick - off but in qualifying for @entity104 were only outscored in their continent by @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109			1
they blitzed their opponents in chilly @entity112 with attacks of pace and fluidity			0
they also disturbed @entity6 with long balls and occasional physicality			2
the @entity118 ’ defending was pretty abysmal too			0
slimani got the first in the 26th minute , powering in between centre - backs @entity122 and @entity123 to collect a long ball forward by @entity83 and apply a finish beyond @entity45			2
just one minute and 55 seconds later it was 2 - 0			1
@entity15 swung over a corner that @entity45 thought he could claim but former @entity128 defender @entity14 arrived first to drive a header into the unguarded net			0
the @entity132 goalkeeper was poor in the game against @entity134 and could be replaced when @entity26 come calling			0
more comical defending arrived soon after when @entity63 and @entity62 got in each others ’ way as they attempted to clear a long ball , only succeeding in allowing it to fall to @entity13 , who squared to @entity85 to sweep in			1
@entity6 manager @entity140 , veteran of the 2002 team which made the semi-finals , must have said something to rouse his players at the break because they were much improved in the second half			2
hug : @entity23 ( centre ) celebrates with his team - mates during the win over @entity6 in @entity150 jump for joy : @entity14 leaps and punches the air after putting @entity0 2 - 0 up against @entity6 ecstasy : @entity23 ( right ) runs to the corner and is followed by team - mates after scoring the fourth high five : @entity6 midfielder son ( left ) celebrates with @entity66 ( right ) after scoring his side 's first goal @entity80 ’s inability to deal with a high ball allowed son to whip a finish in between the legs of @entity78 five minutes after the interval and @entity6 looked like they might make a comeback when a quick free - kick by @entity169 had to be headed off the line by @entity171			1
@entity172 then produced a marvellous one - handed save to deny @entity174 ’s @entity173 a ferocious , swerving goal from 30 yards that was heading for the top corner			0
but @entity178 dispelled @entity180 fears three minutes after the hour by finishing off a neat move that involved a slick exchange of passes with @entity85			2
@entity184 tapped in from @entity186 ’s cross with 18 minutes left to reduce the deficit to two once more but it was in vain			0
@entity0 will progress to the last - 16 for the first time in their history with a draw in their final game against @entity134 and would play the runners - up from the group containing @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity107 and @entity200			2
sadness and joy : @entity0 players celebrate ( right ) as @entity88 ( left ) @entity203 ( centre ) devastation : @entity6 's son slaps the ground in frustration after his side 's 4 - 2 loss to @entity0 to put that achievement in context , this is @entity0 ’s fourth appearance at @entity5 finals and they have just two previous wins to their name			1
those both came in 1982 when they were denied progress to the knock - out phase by an outrageous bit of gamesmanship from @entity198 and @entity226 in playing out a result that ensured they both progressed at the expense of the north africans			0
@entity0 exacting revenge on @entity198 32 years later would usually be the stuff of fantasy			0
but , as we have seen , anything is possible in @entity104 .			0

@entity13 , @entity14 and @entity85 fire @entity0 3 - 0 up at half - time
@entity19 - min with consolation for @entity6 at start of second half
@entity23 seals the win with a fourth after 62 minutes in @entity150
@entity57 ensures a nervy finish with a goal after 72 minutes
result leaves @entity0 second in @entity27 , with @entity6 bottom
first time an @entity22 team have scored four goals in a @entity5 match
