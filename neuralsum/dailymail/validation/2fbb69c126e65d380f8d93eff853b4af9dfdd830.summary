funny guys : a group of @entity8 @entity7 jokers took a £ 7 print from @entity4 and placed it in the @entity25 in @entity12 the team from @entity27 placed the cheap canvas on display in the @entity30 in @entity12 , and asked art lovers for an appraisal			1
they told visitors the painting was done by famous @entity37 artist ' @entity38 ' , and , according to the pranksters , all of the nearly 20 people interviewed bought the lie			0
the video shows presenter @entity44 talking about the painting to a number of visitors , who call the cheap print ' modern ' and ' shocking '			1
one man praises the print for its ' constructiveness of things on top of each other , inside each other '			0

joke : presenter @entity44 told visitors the ' painting ' was done by famous @entity37 artist ' @entity38 ' and say everyone of the nearly 20 people interviewed bought the lie a man in a flatcap , beard and glasses , claims he can ' clearly see that it concerns a form of symbolism ' when asked how much they believe the artwork to be worth , one guesses ' over 1,000 euro ' , while another says : ' if you could buy this for 2.5million euros , i 'd do it			2
' ' the whole day everyone thought our " painting " amazing , ' the team behind the prank says			0
' when the people talked about that this image is a symbol of the painters spirit , and that it could be worth a 200,000 euros or even 2.5million euros it made us laugh inside ! ' when the pranksters told the art fans about their @entity4 hoax , a majority saw the funny side , but , lifehunterstv reveals , not all were pleased about being duped			1
' the last two guys could n't even say one word as a reaction and just walked away with red cheeks			0
we could feel the awkwardness '			0
taking it well : when the pranksters told the art fans about their @entity4 hoax , a majority saw the funny side hit a nerve ? two men who had praised the painting were so offended when told that it was a cheap @entity4 print that they left without a word this comes just days after @entity4 customers in the @entity8 were stopped from organising a mass - game of hide and seek			1
a whopping 19,000 people signed up to a @entity122 group promoting a game at @entity4 's @entity125 branch next month , and another 13,000 signed up for a game in the @entity4 store in the city of @entity129			2
but the @entity37 retail giant has bad news for folks wanting to hide among its room - like furniture displays : the numbers signing up are getting out of hand and the events have been blocked			0
' we have contacted these pages on social media and humbly asked them to have their hide and seek games somewhere else , ' @entity4 spokeswoman @entity138 said tuesday			2
ms @entity138 added that @entity4 does not want to be a spoilsport , but safety comes first .			0
