one former drugs cheat , @entity1 , ran the quickest 100 metres time in the world this year on thursday night , while another , @entity3 , made his comeback with 9.93secs in second place			1
despite a night featuring some stellar performances , this was ultimately a sad night for track and field at the @entity12 meeting in @entity13			2
@entity1 , who served a four - year ban for a second positive test in 2006 , powered to victory in 9.80secs to regain the @entity19 spot from @entity21 's @entity20 , but his @entity23 team - mate gay certainly did not look like a man who has spent a year on the sidelines			1
paceman : @entity1 ( left ) held off the challenge of @entity3 the former world champion equalled the third - fastest time this year in his first race after a one - year drugs ban and then declared he had been ' welcomed back with open arms '			1
he was certainly given a warm reception by the near - capacity crowd in @entity13			1
@entity3 said : ' it feels good ( to be back )			2
yes , it 'll be a long road to redemption , but i 'm happy with my time			0
' it 's been tough training - i 've been under a lot of stress and stuff like that - but i made it through			2
photo finish : @entity1 celebrates by taking a ' selfie ' with young fans in @entity49 video gay back from drugs ban ' everybody 's been giving me hand shakes and i 've been given a great reception			1
it 's just so good to be back			0
' @entity1 added : ' i wanted my world lead back			1
@entity3 is a strong finisher but i was able to hold him off			0
that 's what shows i 'm a world leader right now and i 'm happy with that			0
' i want to quieten the doubters			0
i wish i could race in the @entity61 and race in the relay against @entity63			0

@entity1 ran a year - best 9.80 seconds in the 100m in @entity49
gay clocked 9.93 , he ran 9.79 at the same venue a year *ago*
