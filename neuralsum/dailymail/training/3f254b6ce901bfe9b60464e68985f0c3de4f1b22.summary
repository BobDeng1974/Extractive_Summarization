at least 454,571 additional places in primaries will be required in @entity12 within three years			1
this equates to 2,030 extra schools , with an average intake of 224 pupils			1
at least 454,571 additional places in primaries will be required in @entity12 within three years councils are scouring empty buildings to house lessons as they struggle to accommodate the influx of pupils			1
the estimates – based on @entity24 figures following a survey of 151 local authorities – were released yesterday by @entity28 ’s education spokesman @entity27			1
he said the @entity29 must use the budget to tackle the issue			1
the @entity32 and @entity34 @entity33 have previously accused the @entity35 of failing to prepare sufficiently for the looming admissions crisis			1
education secretary @entity37 said the last government ignored warnings of a baby boom as early as 2004 the worst affected areas include @entity42 , which needs almost 14,000 extra primary places by 2015 ; @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 , which all require more than 11,000 , and @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 , which need more than 9,000			1
across @entity52 , an additional 100,000 primary places are needed by 2015			2
in @entity54 and @entity55 , where more than 8,000 extra primary places are required , the council is proposing to rent out a former @entity5 store and a warehouse from @entity59 to house temporary classes			1
officials in @entity62 are considering teaching pupils in @entity65 ’s football stadium , a bingo hall or in redundant churches due to a shortage of school places			1
and at @entity72 in @entity49 , a surge in numbers means pupils have to eat their lunch in five different shifts , with the first wave sitting down to eat at 11.15am			2
the dining hall is too small to accommodate all 400 pupils at once			2
tens of thousands of children are already being squeezed into overcrowded schools , with one in five primaries at bursting point			2
some 3,428 were classified as ‘ full or had pupils in excess of school capacity ’ in may last year			2

and out of 41 primary schools in @entity97 , @entity52 , 26 were full or had excess numbers of pupils			0
mr @entity27 yesterday accused the government of being ‘ oblivious ’ to the problem and ‘ preferring to focus on pet projects ’ such as free schools			0
he said : ‘ the government needs to address this head on in the budget – allocating all its education capital to meeting real need , not salami slicing some off for pet projects			0
’ but education secretary @entity37 accused @entity28 of hypocrisy , pointing out that the last government ignored @entity111 warnings of a baby boom as early as 2004			0
under @entity28 , councils were told to cut primary places			0
mr @entity37 said : ‘ @entity28 ’s hypocrisy is breathtaking			0
for years they ignored warnings about the baby boom and splurged billions on extravagant secondary school projects instead			0
‘ by contrast , we have more than doubled funding for extra places to give local authorities the resources they need			0
’ last july , mr @entity37 announced £ 500million of funding to create more primary places in time for september 2012 , taking the total spend to £ 1.3billion in 2011/12			0
@entity126 , general secretary of the @entity127 , said : ‘ there are limits to how far a primary can grow and still retain the ethos that makes it special and welcoming to young children			0

they could be taught in bingo halls and even a former @entity5 store
