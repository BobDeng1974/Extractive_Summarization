do n’t worry , @entity1 fans			1
there could be a saviour on the way			0
after watching their side lose to @entity8 for the first time in the @entity10 , the @entity1 faithful will have been feeling a bit down			1
now , they could see one of the world ’s best strikers in their line - up when they take on @entity17 after the international break			1
the @entity10 champions have a long - standing interest in @entity21 , whose move is more likely with @entity23 keen to sign for @entity24 on loan			1
transfer : @entity21 could be on his way to the @entity10 with @entity1 @entity21 normally carries a £ 50million price tag but he is also available on loan for the season at a cost of £ 12m			1
@entity1 ’s director of football @entity32 is understood to have held talks with @entity36 officials at last thursday ’s @entity38 draw in the principality			1
@entity40 were favourites to sign @entity21 , 28 , who appeared to confirm his move to the @entity42 in a message posted on his official @entity45 account that was hastily deleted on saturday			1
however , @entity40 instead opted for @entity46 from @entity47			0
@entity21 ’s agent @entity48 is believed to have spent last week pushing @entity21 towards the @entity49 in the hope of executing both deals			1
the situation has been further complicated by the fact that @entity23 is sidelined with a broken foot			2
the @entity55 has had a protective boot removed and no longer requires crutches , but he was seen limping after saturday ’s home defeat by @entity8 and is out of action for at least another month			0
available : @entity36 have offered the @entity60 forward on a permanent or loan deal @entity36 : @entity62 has endured a difficult time at @entity36 since joining from @entity64 @entity1 would have had to sell @entity23 and possibly two more if they wanted to sign @entity21 on a permanent deal and still meet the £ 49m net spend limit set by @entity68 ’s financial fair play rules but the loan agreement would n’t be a problem			1
the @entity1 boss said : ‘ we will see what happens			2
we have a restriction about the amount of money we can spend and the number of players we can use , so it ’s not easy			0
’ @entity79 was speaking after seeing @entity1 fail to score at home in the league for only the second time in 71 games			2
with @entity83 making his first start of the season and @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 at @entity79 ’s disposal , @entity1 looked flat following last week ’s win over @entity92			2
@entity93 : @entity21 missed out on playing at the @entity93 after suffering a serious knee einjury the defeat by @entity8 could not have come at a worse time for @entity79 as he prepares to lose his players to international duty once again before a week of critical fixtures			1
city face title rivals @entity17 and @entity101 on consecutive weekends either side of a visit to @entity105 in their opening @entity38 tie			2
@entity1 were undone by a wonderful solo goal from @entity108			2

‘ it was a goal we can not concede , ’ added @entity79			0
‘ it came from our corner			0
’ @entity1 may also sell players today with @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 available			1
super stat : @entity8 ended a run of 12 @entity10 defeats in @entity126 , having lost away to @entity1 and @entity47 on every occasion since winning promotion in 2008			1
