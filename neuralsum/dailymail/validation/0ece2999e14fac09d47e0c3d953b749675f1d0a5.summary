a @entity1 mp is refusing to repay hundreds of pounds in expenses for over-claiming his mileage - after the commons watchdog checked his journeys on @entity6			1
@entity8 @entity7 was found to have filed more than 700 claims for travel around his constituency that were either ‘ inaccurate ’ or not allowed under the rules			1
some were said to be for up to five times the real distance after they were checked			1
but the @entity16 mp has refused to accept the conclusions , insisting he will hand back only £ 237 - despite being asked to repay more than £ 1,000			1
@entity8 @entity7 was found to have filed more than 700 claims for travel around his constituency that were either ‘ inaccurate ’ or not allowed under the rules an appeal from the mp has now been rejected by @entity21 compliance officer @entity20 on the basis that it ‘ largely reiterated the points made by him in his original representations ’			1
if mr @entity7 refuses to repay the £ 1,006.20 by next week , he could be hit with a £ 1,000 fine and legal action to retrieve the money from his salary			1
mr @entity20 is also understood to be considering new evidence and has already warned he could extend his inquiry back further than january 2013 - potentially opening mr @entity7 up to a fresh bill			1
in his appeal , mr @entity7 condemned the findings as ‘ arbitrary and draconian ’ and designed to generate a ‘ good headline for @entity21 ’			1
he stressed he had apologised for £ 82.80 of travel to party political events , and was ‘ extremely reluctantly ’ ready to repay £ 97.65 for party political journeys even though mr @entity20 had not ‘ properly evaluated ’ the situation			1
he said he would return another £ 56.70 for home to office travel because he could not produce ‘ detailed evidence ’ to support it			2
@entity44 's reputation is till being dragged through the mud by controversial expense claims made by mps but mr @entity7 made clear he did not accept criticism of the distances he had claimed for			1
‘ i absolutely maintain that these routes are the most cost effective possible based on local traffic conditions and the need to ensure that journeys are of a predictable duration to arrive at the appointed time , ’ he said			0
‘ my claims are provably compliant with the scheme so therefore you should withdraw your damaging and entirely unwarranted allegations at this juncture			0
‘ i understand that , having embarked on and publicly announced this investigation , it is in your personal interest to back up this decision with findings of wrongdoing that will generate a good headline for @entity21			0
‘ therefore i am sorry to report that i will absolutely be maintaining my innocence in this matter to my constituents , to the @entity72 and on the floor of the @entity74 if necessary			0
’ last month 's provisional report from mr @entity20 revealed that @entity21 officials wrote to mr @entity7 in october 2011 voicing concern that he was putting in for ‘ around twice the average for constituency mileage across the @entity80 and some six times higher than other suburban @entity83 area constituencies where mileage is claimed ’			1
commons officials checked mr @entity7 's claims on @entity6 maps the watchdog triggered an initial investigation by its compliance officer in december 2012 , with mr @entity7 being told : ‘ a comparison of your claims against the distances quoted by @entity6 would suggest a pattern of over-claiming			1
on average , your claims are almost twice the distance shown on @entity6 and in some cases significantly more			0
’ a two - mile journey from his home to @entity102 had been claimed as 10 miles , while a five - mile return trip to @entity104 was filed as 15 miles			0
after a discussion with mr @entity7 , mr @entity20 declined to launch a full - blown investigation , instead deciding the issue could be dealt with through ‘ support and advice from @entity21 to ensure the mp improved his record - keeping ’			2
however , an audit in 2013 - 14 found that mr @entity7 had again racked up the highest mileage of any mp			2
he claimed more than 400 miles per square mile of his constituency , almost double the average for the next 10 highest - claiming mps			0
a 33 - mile return journey to the new @entity120 training ground in @entity121 was claimed as 54 miles - although the mp later admitted this was a mistake and the figure should have been 39 miles			0
the compliance officer this time launched a formal probe - but only looked at claims made after his meeting with the mp in january 2013			2
he found that mr @entity7 had merely reduced standard claims for regular journeys by a single mile - for example , saying he drove 14 miles to @entity104 rather than 15			2
during the investigation , mr @entity7 attempted to explain apparently standard claims for journeys to areas of his constituency by arguing that he was using ‘ average ’ distances			2
but mr @entity20 said that ‘ conflicted with other statements that journeys were dependent on the traffic conditions pertaining at the time of travel ’			0
he also rejected a suggestion from mr @entity7 that he was using local knowledge to avoid traffic and find the quickest rather than shortest routes - ‘ if this were the case then journeys would show distinct variations ’			0
mr @entity20 examined mr @entity7 's diaries and used @entity6 to establish the actual distances			0
in 165 out of 169 , the claim was greater than that given by the mapping tool .			0

@entity7 made 700 travel claims that were ' inaccurate ' or not allowed
some were up to five times the real distance after they were checked online
the @entity16 mp has refused to accept the expense watchdog findings
says he will hand back only £ 237 despite being asked to repay over £ 1,000
