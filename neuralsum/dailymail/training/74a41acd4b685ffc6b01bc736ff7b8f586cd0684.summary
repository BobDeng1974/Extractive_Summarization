@entity0 is being lined up as the next captain of @entity2 — with a reminder from manager @entity4 that whoever picks up the armband from @entity7 must convince him that their off - the - field behaviour will not bring the coveted role into disrepute			1
with @entity7 leaving @entity2 at the end of the season , @entity0 is in prime position to take over as captain , providing he signs the five - year £ 300,000 - a - week deal on offer to him			1
@entity4 has made it clear ahead of the @entity21 game against bottom - of - the - table @entity22 — one that @entity2 must win to keep their fading @entity25 prospects alive — that he sees the @entity2 captaincy as having a huge ambassadorial element to it , as well as leading the other players during matches			1
certainly , any repeat of scandals that have dogged @entity0 in the past would count against him			2
successor : @entity2 boss @entity4 ( right ) is lining up @entity0 to be the club 's next captain exit : current captain @entity7 ( right ) announced he will leave at the end of the season @entity40 is set to commit his international future to @entity42 after he turned down the chance to play for @entity44 in this summer ’s @entity45			1
the 19 - year - old @entity2 winger is the most wanted teenager in @entity47 , with @entity42 , @entity44 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 trying to persuade him to commit his international future to them			2
@entity40 will not make an official announcement until next year but sources close to the player believe @entity42 is his favoured option			0
talking about his search for a new skipper , @entity4 said : ‘ we want people to show leadership qualities , not just on the pitch but off the pitch			2
it is a big standing to be captain of @entity2			1
‘ the person who takes over has to understand what it means for the club , the responsibility it carries , what is required of you as well			1
i think we have a lot of leaders in the dressing room and they will all get a chance to stake their claim			0
’ asked specifically about @entity0 ’s prospects , the @entity2 manager added : ‘ like everyone else , i ’ll give everyone that opportunity to stand up and show what they can do in the coming months			1
’ @entity0 hinted that what he really wants is to stay at @entity2 and beat sir @entity90 ’s club goalscoring record			1
and the prospect of him being given the @entity2 captaincy — one of the most prestigious roles in @entity97 football and previously held by @entity99 greats @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 — has been discussed during @entity0 ’s contract talks			1
record breaker : @entity0 has hinted he wants to stay at the club and break sir @entity90 's ( below ) goalscoring record part of @entity2 ’s pitch to @entity0 has been that he would be guaranteed a place in the club ’s history if he signs his new deal			1
he has already had 10 years at the club and , were he to sign for another five , barring injury he would be certain to become the all - time top scorer at the club			0
he is currently fourth on that list with 208 goals – behind @entity121 , with 211 , @entity122 with 237 and @entity90 with 249			2
the thought of handing @entity0 the captaincy is an indication of how important both the club and manager @entity4 consider him to their future — though it is a remarkable turnaround from last summer , when the club ’s former manager , sir @entity131 , said that @entity0 had asked to leave			1
@entity0 has always denied that claim , although the acrimony it generated made a departure seem the most likely outcome			2
@entity0 as a captain would have seemed an unlikely outcome in his early career , when his private life was featuring on the front pages of newspapers and his discipline on the pitch was erratic — he has been sent off five times in his career			2
improvement : @entity0 's disciplinary record has got better - his last red card came against @entity152 in 2011 but while he was fortunate to avoid red earlier this season when he kicked out at @entity156 in the 2 - 2 draw at @entity158 , his disciplinary record has improved considerably in recent years			1
the last red card he received was while playing for @entity42 against @entity152 in october 2011			0
he has twice been sent off for @entity2 , the last time occurring during a 2 - 0 defeat at @entity22 in march 2009			2
@entity163 , who has been at @entity2 for 13 years and has recently returned following treatment for ulcerative colitis , is another serious candidate for the captaincy , while @entity167 has an outside chance if @entity4 decides he wants a skipper for the next 10 years			1
other candidates , including @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 , are expected to follow @entity7 out of the club at the end of the season			1
@entity177 : @entity173 ( left ) and @entity172 would be candidates for the captaincy but are expected to follow @entity7 out of @entity99 at the end of the season more pressingly , @entity4 is ready to take a selection gamble for the must - win game at @entity99 with wednesday ’s trip to @entity183 in mind			1
@entity2 have already lost at home against @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190 this season but @entity4 would prefer not to play all three of his star triumvirate — @entity192 , @entity0 and @entity193 — for a game against @entity22 that they should win comfortably anyway			1
the @entity2 manager admitted : ‘ we ’ve got two big games coming up , a big one on wednesday , too , and have to take that into consideration			2
i must say i thought we played quite well last week [ in a 2 - 1 defeat at @entity200 ] and i hope it continues			0
‘ @entity193 has played well in the games so far and has contributed well			0
it was the first time we had @entity192 and @entity0 playing together since the start of the season and if we see more of that between now and the end of the season , it will hopefully lead to better performances and more points			1
’ return : former first team coach @entity212 is set to return to @entity99 with @entity22 on sunday coming up against @entity131 ’s former head coach , @entity22 boss @entity212 , adds spice to the fixture and @entity4 will be happy to take the three points rather than insist on a bagful of goals			2
‘ like any manager , i ’d take any win but if we win in style , great			0
our form at @entity99 has n’t given us that			0
i hope it does between now and the end of the season			0
i would never be so presumptuous to think that would be the way			0
‘ we never looked like losing in our last home game against @entity158 [ a 2 - 0 win ] but i actually think we played better against @entity200 in a match we lost than we did against @entity158			0
‘ that may not be the way you see it but that is how i felt			0
we can improve a lot on both performances			0
’ rested : @entity4 could rest one of @entity0 , @entity193 ( left ) or @entity238 against @entity22 as his team play @entity183 on wednesday @entity2 traditionally come strong in the last third of the season and they will need to this time , with a gap between them and top - four rivals @entity243 , @entity189 and @entity188			1
‘ we have to just win our games and hope other teams slip up			0
that ’s what has to happen if we are to get into the position we want , ’ said @entity4			0
‘ we ’ve always felt capable of doing it and getting our players back and fit will put us in a position to do so			0
’ @entity212 has claimed @entity4 did not offer him a role after succeeding @entity131 last summer , a stance at odds with the @entity2 boss			1
trusted : @entity212 had a close working relationship under sir @entity131 it appears now both men agreed to part ways and @entity4 said : ‘ i could turn it around and say @entity212 did n’t keep any of the backroom staff when he went to @entity22			2
@entity212 got the opportunity to stay but i think the decision he took was right			0
‘ he made the right decision and i believe i made the right decision as well			0
it was the right time for everybody			0
i knew it was going to be a big job and it has proved just that			0
i have the chance to build things up			0
’ @entity7 is expected to return to @entity2 ’s line - up against @entity22 after serving a suspension for his dismissal against @entity275 a fortnight ago .			1
