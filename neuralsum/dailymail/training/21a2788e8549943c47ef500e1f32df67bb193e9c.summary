by @entity1 reporter published : 05:53 est , 4 april 2012 updated : 06:52 est , 4 april 2012 tasered : @entity3 , pictured in his days as a @entity4 , was allegedly unarmed when he was shot by police a chronically ill african - american heart patient died after police officers - called to deal with a medical emergency - burst into his home and tasered him twice in the chest , it has been claimed			1
@entity14 was allegedly shot by stun and beanbag guns at his @entity17 , @entity18 , apartment in the early hours of november 19			1
the victim , who had also worked as a correction officer , died in hospital later that day			0
at first officers said the shooting was ' justified ' as self - defence because the ' deranged ' victim had first attacked officers with a hatchet and knife			1
but , four months later , a grand jury is now being convened to look into alleged inconsistencies in the record of the involved officers ' version of events			1
this is because fresh evidence , in the form of a recording from medical alert company lifeaid purporting to reveal everything said inside the apartment , has come to light			2
two videos which capture some of the incident , from a building security camera and also attached to a stun gun used by the police , have also emerged			1
lawyers for @entity50 's son , @entity49 , say police were called to the sleeping 68 - year - old 's housing project home in the early hours of the morning			1
he had accidentally triggered his @entity55 pendant and then failed to respond to calls			0
on arrival he told officers banging on his door they were not needed			2
but they heard banging come from the apartment and thought someone could be in serious danger			0
claims : a chronically ill heart patient died after police officers - called to deal with a medical emergency - burst into his home and tasered him twice in the chest ( file picture ) an hour - long stand - off ensued and he became more agitated as he saw armed police arriving			1
on the recording an officer is apparently heard screaming ' i do n't give a f * * * n * * * * * , open the door ' , a second yells ' i need to use your bathroom to pee ' , while others taunted him about his military background			0
on one of the videos , police are shown prying part of the door open			0
a metal object , which could be what police thought was a hatchet , slips through the gap and falls in the hallway			2
they remove the hinges to the door and , on entering the flat , see @entity50 standing in his boxer shorts , with his arms at his side and hands empty			0
family lawyer @entity100 , a former @entity101 assistant district attorney , told the @entity102 : ' the minute they got in the house , they didnâ € ™ t even give him one command			0
' they never mentioned ' putyour hands up			0
' they never told him to lay down on the bed			0
the first thing they did ... you could see the @entity114 light up ... and you could see it going directly toward him			0
' uproar : the case is similar , some say , to the killing of @entity119 ( left ) by @entity120 ( right ) which sparked outrage because the latter has never been arrested almost 200,000 people have signed an online petition demanding justice in the case			1
@entity101 district attorney @entity127 confirmed a grand jury will begin hearing evidence in the case this month			2
the outrage follows the shooting of black teen @entity119 , 17 , who was gunned down by neighbourhood watch volunteer @entity120 , 28 , in february			2
@entity120 claims he acted in self - defence after being sucker - punched by the teen in a gated community in @entity135 , @entity136			1
the fact @entity120 was never arrested has sparked outrage across the country and roiled race relations			0
tens of thousands of protesters have marched at rallies across the @entity144 confusion now surrounds exactly what happened - with details emerging of the gunman 's criminal past , and @entity119 's history of truancy , drugs and graffiti .			1

@entity14 , 68 , allegedly shot by stun and beanbag guns
officers claimed ' self - defence ' as he was ' deranged ' and ' *waving* hatchet '
but new evidence claims he was unarmed and racially taunted by police
@entity168 convened over ' alleged inconsistencies ' over police reports
claims ' crime was covered up like @entity119 case '
