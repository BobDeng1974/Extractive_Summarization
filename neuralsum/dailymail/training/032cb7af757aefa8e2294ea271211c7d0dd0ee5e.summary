he claims the burial ground will yield such magnificent treasures that those discovered in the nearby tomb of @entity7 in the @entity20 will seem like a ' display in @entity22 ' in comparison			1
like a plot out of an @entity27 movie , experts are now racing to secure the site called @entity29 , located in the cliffs on @entity15 's west bank , before the arrival of so - called treasure hunters and tomb - raiders			1
race : archaeology teams are racing to find the tomb of three ancient @entity4 kings in @entity15 's west bank search : it is believed three priest kings - @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 - were buried in @entity42 in @entity15 's west bank near the @entity20 and the @entity44 it is feared that ancient rock inscriptions surrounding the site , which has remained largely untouched since @entity48 , could be damaged by their quad bikes , rope ladders and other equipment			1
@entity8 told the @entity52 : ' last week , three people were arrested by the army security services at @entity15 for entering it			2
' the only person known to have excavated at the site was @entity58 - the man who first scratched a hole through the sealed doorway of @entity7 's burial chamber in 1922			0

the tomb of the three priest kings is believed to be located just a few miles away in @entity42 he discovered huge mounds of limestone chippings on the wadi floor , identical to those found in the royal tombs in the @entity20			1
but @entity58 gave up on his excavations , possibly because he had little idea of what may be buried at the site			0
