by @entity0 published : 06:35 est , 22 august 2012 updated : 11:04 est , 22 august 2012 developers are ' tricking ' councils into giving wind farms planning permission by producing pictures which make turbines look smaller than they really are , a leading architect has claimed			1
@entity8 , an architect based in @entity9 , @entity10 , warned that people were being ' misled ' because images submitted as part of planning applications were often little more than ' artifice '			1
he said that , in the most extreme cases , a turbine could be made to look four times smaller than it actually is			1
wind turbines look small in the distance in this image - a 50mm panoramic photomontage with a horizontal field of a 28mm wide angle - lens which conforms to @entity26 's guidance the turbines appear larger in this picture of the same landscape - a 75mm single frame photomontage which is representative of landscape scale as seen from the viewpoint his claims raise fears that councillors may approve developments which are far more imposing on the countryside than they expect			1
mr @entity8 , a member of the @entity41 , said small changes to the size of the photograph , the angle at which it is taken , the zoom on the camera and how the image is presented could all make turbines appear smaller than they actually are			1
' local people are being misled about the potential visual impact of such large structures , ' he told the @entity55			0
more than 3,000 wind turbines have already been built on @entity58 land , but there are understood to be plans to construct another 5,000			0
mr @entity8 said developers commonly used a wide - angle lens and zoom out , providing a wider shot of the landscape			1
but the wider the angle and the further away the zoom , the smaller the objects in the photograph will look			2
mr @entity8 's concerns have been accepted in part by @entity26 ( @entity26 ) , which is to review the guidance it provides to developers			1
imposing : a view of @entity76 's largest onshore wind farm , @entity77 on the outskirts of @entity79			0
there is no suggestion that developers behind the scheme misled planners a @entity26 spokesman said : ' we accept some , but not all , of mr @entity87 ’s concerns			2
' we do n’t agree with the suggestion that developers have deliberately made turbines appear smaller			2
' in our view most developers have followed our current guidance , in good faith , and provided good quality visualisations			0
' images are shrunk to make them fit on standard paper sizes			0
everyone 's experience is evolving in this field and our aim is to improve the guidance to reduce the risk of under - representation in future			0
' we will be consulting on revised methodology in the next few months			0
this consultation will help determine what changes we will make to the guidance			0

leading architect claims councils are being ' tricked ' into approving turbines
@entity8 , from @entity9 , says turbines can be made to look four times smaller than they really are
developers use wide - angle lenses to make objects in the pictures look smaller , mr @entity8 says
@entity26 *intends* to revise its guidance to developers
