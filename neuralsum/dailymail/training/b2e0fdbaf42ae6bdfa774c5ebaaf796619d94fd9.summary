the @entity0 is on course to take a leading role in the government of the whole of the @entity5 after a poll showed a record number of @entity9 voters plan to back the party			1
almost half of all voters north of the border now say they will support the @entity14 at the general election – prompting speculation that @entity17 could become deputy prime minister in a coalition administration			0
the @entity0 is on course to win as many as 54 of the 59 @entity9 constituencies , a result which would mean it holding the balance of power at @entity25			1
a @entity41 poll for the @entity43 newspaper found that 48 per cent of voters now say they will back the @entity0 next may – its highest ever predicted vote share in @entity25 elections from the pollster			1
@entity33 is on course to get only 24 per cent , the @entity49 16 per cent , the @entity50 5 per cent and @entity51 4 per cent			1
that would mean the loss of as many as 39 of @entity33 ’s 41 @entity25 seats in @entity9 – a result which would scupper @entity57 ’s hopes of entering @entity58 with a @entity60 majority			1
instead , the @entity33 leader would be left having to bargain with mr @entity17 , who is to stand for a @entity25 seat , the @entity64 constituency in @entity65 , in may			0
first minister @entity66 has overseen a surge in support for the @entity0 since taking over from @entity17 mr @entity17 stepped down as @entity9 ’s first minister after losing the independence referendum in september			2
the @entity0 could end up in a position of power over the entire @entity5 – an unthinkable outcome months after its referendum defeat			2
@entity66 , the @entity0 leader and the new first minister , said the poll was a ‘ great early @entity77 present ’			0
labour leader @entity57 could be deprived of a @entity60 majority if new @entity34 fails to turn around the party 's dire poll ratings she added : ‘ we take absolutely nothing for granted – and the hard work begins in the new year to ensure that we achieve a strong group of @entity0 mps to give @entity9 the strongest possible voice at @entity25			1
‘ that way , we can use our influence to bring an end to austerity economics , make @entity9 free of @entity92 nuclear weapons , and get the powers @entity9 needs to build a fairer society and more prosperous economy			0
’ the @entity0 ’s campaign director , @entity96 mp , added : ‘ the poll shows that @entity34 has had a “ reverse honeymoon ” as leader of @entity33 in @entity9 – with the @entity0 stretching our lead even further since he took up the post			1
on these figures , @entity33 would even lose mr @entity34 ’s seat			0
’ mr @entity34 insisted @entity9 @entity33 was ‘ changing ’			2
he added : ‘ we are one week into a new leadership team and really determined to change			0
‘ during the referendum @entity9 was divided between @entity106 or @entity107 but in the general election most @entity9 will be united in wanting to get @entity109 out of @entity110			0
’ polls currently indicate that @entity5 voters are set to return a hung parliament for the second election in succession			0
there are increasing fears in @entity118 that the election could produce an effective dead heat between the main parties – with only a ‘ rainbow coalition ’ made up of three or more parties able to govern			0
the @entity0 has indicated that in such circumstances , it would not prop up a @entity49 - led government – but could offer support to @entity33 in return for a series of costly concessions			1
mr @entity17 has already suggested his mps are prepared to start influencing @entity132 laws on a ‘ vote by vote ’ basis to prop up a @entity33 government .			2

some 48 ***%*** of @entity9 voters are now planning to back the @entity0 in may
@entity33 trailing on just 24 ***%*** , with the @entity1*40* only 8 points behind on 16 ***%***
the result would leave @entity33 with just four mps – down from *40* today
