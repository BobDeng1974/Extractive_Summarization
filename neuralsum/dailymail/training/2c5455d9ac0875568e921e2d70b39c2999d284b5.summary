alarming evidence has revealed that @entity2 city dwellers are regularly dining on endangered animals			0
scientists warn the taste for bushmeat in urban environments poses a particular threat to @entity10 wildlife			1
they say that the voracious appetite for jungle - dwelling creatures is two-fold : the high level of poverty makes the animals attractive because they are free , while at the other end of society creatures , such as the yellow - spotted river turtle , are treated as delicacies			1
warning : graphic content research has uncovered alarming evidence of people frequently dining on yellow spotted river turtles and rare fish such as semaprochilodus , in @entity2 cities			1
here a yellow - footed tortoise is seen tied up experts from @entity30 and @entity2 interviewed households in two @entity2 ‘ prefrontier ’ cities – those that are surrounded by more than 90 per cent of their original forest cover			1
they found that virtually all urban households in the cities of @entity38 and @entity39 consumed jungle wildlife for food			1
almost all of the 153 households – 99 per cent – eat fish found in the forests at least once a month , while 79 per cent eat bushmeat made up of both mammals and birds			2
this graph shows wildlife consumption by @entity10 households , combined with conservation threat status of animals			2
the horizontal bars show the percentage of households that have eaten each species in the last 12 months , while the black dots indicate @entity60 threat status for animals and white dots , threat status for fish experts believe that the voracious appetite for jungle - dwelling creatures is driven by the fact they are free , and many people are living in poverty , while others eat unusual meat such as lowland tapir ( pictured ) for reasons of ‘ prestige ' experts from @entity30 and @entity2 interviewed households in two @entity2 ‘ prefrontier ’ cities – those that are surrounded by more than 90 per cent of their original forest cover			1
they found that virtually all urban households in the cities of @entity38 and @entity39 ( marked on the map ) consumed wildlife for food the study found that bushmeat was eaten at least once a month by 44 per cent of urban households in the @entity10 cities of @entity38 and @entity39			1
a total of almost 79 per cent of 153 households surveyed said they have eaten bushmeat in the last 12 months			0
urban households reported consuming 15 species of mammals , 12 species of birds , 62 fish and seven types of reptiles			1
among them are endangered , vulnerable and threatened creatures such as lowland tapir , peacock bass and yellow spotted river turtles			1
nearly half of the households surveyed – 48 per cent - said they eat turtles and tortoises , with 28 per cent feasting on crocodile - like caimans			2
some of the species being eaten are classed as endangered , vulnerable and threatened			0
these include the white - lipped peccary – a type of forest pig – which despite being ‘ near threatened ’ , was eaten by 19 per cent of those surveyed			0
some 15 per cent of people living in the @entity10 cities have eaten ‘ vulnerable ’ lowland tapir and 22 per cent of households have feasted on equally vulnerable yellow - spotted river turtles			1
‘ the high percentage of families that had recently eaten the yellow - spotted river turtle was probably the most surprising , ’ study leader dr @entity122 , told @entity123			1
some 15 per cent of people living in the @entity10 cities have eaten ‘ vulnerable ’ lowland tapir ( stock image ) and 22 per cent of households have feasted on equally vulnerable yellow - spotted river turtles this graph shows municipalities in the @entity10 classified by forest remaining ( coloured bars ) and urban poverty ( black markers )			1
the black circles show half a @entity2 salary per capital ( @entity139 $ 8.50 or $ 3.65/day ) extreme poverty - white circles - equal to a quarter minim salary per capita ( @entity139 $ 4.25 or $ 1.82/day ) and @entity144 extreme poverty - triangles - at $ 1.25/day some of the wildlife species being eaten are classed as endangered , vulnerable and threatened , such as the white - lipped peccary ( stock image ) – a type of forest pig – which despite being ‘ near threatened ’ , has been eaten by 19 per cent of people in the past 12 months ‘ i was very surprised to find that such a high proportion of urban households consume bushmeat			1
’ rare fish including arapaima , tambaqui , dourada and filhote have also ended up on between 15 and 29 per cent of dinner plates , with the vulnerable peacock bass proving a catch for 59 per cent of households			0
experts think that programmes to start a trend away from bushmeat as a source of protein to luxury food could save creatures like woolly monkeys ( pictured ) it was previously assumed that there is low urban demand for bushmeat , but the study , published in the journal conservation letters , claims this is incorrect			2
dr @entity122 said : ‘ the rapid urbanisation of forested wilderness in the @entity10 could threaten biodiversity if expanding cities drive demand for wildlife as food			2
‘ there are around 73 cities such as those we studied , occupying around 1.86 million square km2 of forest			0
‘ previously it was thought that city dwellers did not consume much wildlife but we found that was not the case			0
in fact , nearly every household did			0
‘ people were hunting , fishing and consuming wildlife for a number of different reasons , for some bushmeat was the most affordable protein source they could access , for others it was a question of preference for eating particular “ prestige ” species			0
’ he explained that large turtles can cost £ 100 each , and that tambaqui fish can fetch a similar amount among @entity2 ’s growing upper class			0
‘ both these species are eaten because they are traditional regional delicacies , ’ he said			2
he believes that programmes to start a long - term trend away from bushmeat as a means to protein to luxury food , could help the situation , but not solve it completely			0
‘ we need to find ways of alleviating poverty and supplying poor city - dwellers with affordable alternatives to eating wildlife so that in the long term wildlife ceases to be an economical source of protein for the poor , ’ dr @entity122 said			0
‘ innovative environmental governance could limit wildlife consumption to only harvest - tolerant species			0
’ nearly half of the households surveyed – 48 per cent - said they eat turtles and tortoises , with 28 per cent feasting on caimans ( a stock image is shown )			0

yellow - spotted river turtles are among the threatened species being eaten
scientists say taste for bushmeat poses a threat to @entity10 wildlife
@entity30 study found virtually all urban households in the @entity10 cities of @entity38 and @entity39 consumed wildlife for food
people eat tapirs and monkeys , for example because they are poor
but some endangered fish and turtles are *expensive* regional delicacies
