by @entity0 published : 13:30 est , 24 may 2013 updated : 07:45 est , 25 may 2013 they champion themselves as global defenders of free speech			0
but it seems @entity9 's controversial @entity8 website would rather one filmmaker did n't get to have his say			1
the cyber-publishers appear so desperate to discredit an upcoming documentary about themselves they have taken the unusual step of publishing the entire script online complete with notes pointing out supposed factual errors and sleights of hand			0
pre-emptive strike : @entity8 founder @entity9 appears furious at the content of an upcoming documentary about his organisation in ' we steal secrets : the story of @entity8 , ' @entity27 - winning filmmaker @entity26 set out to uncover the story behind @entity9 , 41 , and the website he founded in 2006 to leak classified information submitted by anonymous sources			1
the documentary , released today , explores how @entity8 , at its height , facilitated the publication of thousands of classified @entity37 government documents , including diplomatic cables and @entity40 logs from the wars in @entity42 and @entity43			1
but the group say the film inaccurately portrays the relationship between @entity8 leader @entity9 and @entity47 , the @entity37 soldier who provided hundreds of thousands of classified @entity37 documents to the site			1
they accuse @entity26 of using a ' crude gay caricature ' to portray @entity47 and say the film depicts his decision to leak documents as ' a failure of character , rather than a triumph of conscience			1
' oscar winning director @entity26 appears to have upset the @entity8 founder to tell the story of @entity8 , @entity26 sought to interview @entity9 but found the elusive @entity60 difficult to persuade , eventually deciding to film without him			1
but the filmmaker spoke to @entity9 several times off camera , and said he came to form a picture of a complex character			0
' if you catch him in unguarded moments , he can be terribly charming , self - deprecating and a really engaging human being , ' @entity26 told @entity69			2
however , whenever @entity9 felt the conversation was becoming an official interview , @entity26 said he became unwilling to ' give me the kind of honest reflections that would have been so important ( to the film ) , ' likening him to a ' human soap box			1
' when @entity26 decided to film the documentary without @entity9 's participation , he said the @entity8 founder did not take the news well			1
' he likens himself as the puppet master , the one who 's pulling the strings on the media			0
i think he took some offense at the idea that i was independent , ' @entity26 said , adding that @entity9 had , at one point , asked to be paid for participating			2
' he mentioned that the market rate for an interview with him was a million dollars			0
i did n't inquire what market that was , ' @entity26 said with a laugh			2
@entity26 said @entity9 had asked him to report what other interview subjects in the documentary were saying about him , something he found to be ' highly ironic			2
' ' ( @entity8 ) was supposed to be a transparency organization , and he was asking me to engage with him as if we 're now some kind of espionage outfit , ' he said			2
@entity26 , 59 , has become a prolific documentarian over the past decade , garnering critical praise for his timely films such as 2005 's ' @entity104 : the @entity105 ' and 2007 's @entity27 - winning ' @entity106			2
' the filmmaker was drawn to @entity8 initially with the idea of it being a ' @entity110 story , with @entity9 being @entity110 , ' but over the course of filming for two years , @entity26 found the story of @entity8 to be as complex as its founder			1
the timing of the film 's release could n't be more poignant , with @entity40 private , @entity47 , 25 , who is accused of leaking classified data to the @entity8 website , due to stand trial on june 3			1
he could face life imprisonment			0
unable to interview @entity47 for the documentary , @entity26 turned to sources that included friends and former colleagues of @entity47 , and hacker @entity127 , who gave the @entity129 online chatroom logs where @entity47 had confided that he had passed classified government information to @entity8			1
@entity26 said he believed that while @entity9 had become a celebrity with @entity8 , @entity47 had become a ' scapegoat			1
' @entity8 complained about the way that @entity47 , the @entity37 soldier who provided hundreds of thousands of classified @entity37 documents to the site , was portrayed ' there 's no doubt that ( @entity47 ) has been improperly scapegoated ... he 's pled guilty to leaking			2
but these larger charges , these more serious charges that the government is trying to hang him with , aiding the enemy , carries a possible death sentence			0
to me , that 's outrageous , ' @entity26 said			0
@entity26 also turned to @entity60 filmmaker @entity145 for footage of @entity9 before he became a headline ; @entity145 had been following the @entity8 founder before the @entity43 war - log leaks , which propelled @entity9 and his website into the news			1
@entity145 ' footage captured a more candid @entity9 , and @entity26 also found home movies from @entity154 that showed the @entity8 found far less guarded , including a clip of him dancing			1
during filming , @entity9 's own story developed alongside that of @entity8 , culminating in him hiding out at the @entity159 in @entity160 to avoid extradition to @entity162 , where he has been accused by two women of rape and sexual assault			2
@entity26 was able to get one of the accusers , former @entity8 volunteer @entity166 , to participate in the documentary			1
' ( @entity9 ) is the expert at holding others to account ...			0
but he 's never wanted anybody to hold him to account			0
he ca n't stand anybody telling him he 's wrong , and so he is refusing to be held to account for these sex allegations in @entity162 , ' @entity26 said			0
' i think his downfall was hubris , ' said @entity26			0
he began to imagine that the transparency agenda and @entity9 were one and the same			0
and that 's a very dangerous place to go			0
' although @entity9 has not seen the film , the @entity8 founder and his supporters , including journalist @entity182 and filmmaker @entity183 , ' denounced ' the documentary after it premiered at the @entity185 in january , @entity26 said			1
' the response around criticism of @entity9 has been a peculiar kind of tribalism , ' said @entity26			0
' as if somehow @entity9 should be above criticism or beyond the law			0
and i find that , in itself ,			0
