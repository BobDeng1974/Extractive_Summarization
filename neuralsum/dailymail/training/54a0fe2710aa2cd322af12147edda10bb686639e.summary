amateur astronomers were able to capture stunning images after they were treated to incredible views of the annual cosmic event			1
the skies are expected to shimmer with a ' natural firework display ' again late last night as a meteor shower crosses into the @entity13 ’s atmosphere			2
although the @entity17 meteor shower is an annual event , the @entity41 believes prospects for this year ’s showing are particularly good and could mean up to 60 shooting stars an hour in the @entity4			1
last night the bright streaks of light flashed through the sky at a rate of around one a minute			2
footage courtesy of @entity52 a photographer has captured a stunning picture of the perseid meteor shower which reached a peak this morning with up to 60 shooting stars an hour in the @entity4 impressive : a @entity17 captured in @entity58 , @entity59 , in a spectacular show that has been enjoyed by humans for the past 2,000 years clear skies in the north of @entity64 meant @entity65 , 29 , had an amazing view of the display , which saw dozens of meteors shooting across the sky each hour			1
mr @entity65 was at @entity70 in @entity28 when he saw the remarkable display between yesterday			0
' it was absolutely stunning , we saw about 60 meteors while we were there , ' he said			0
' usually they just come from one part of the sky but they were coming from all directions , which looked amazing			0
last night the bright streaks of light flashed through the sky at a rate of around one a minute ' there were some big meteors too , which looked more like fire balls and i managed to take a photo of one			2
' it was a clear night so the conditions were ideal for seeing the meteor shower , i ’m not sure if tonight will be so good as it ’s cloudy already			2
' @entity95 , commonly known as shooting stars , are the result of small particles entering the @entity13 ’s atmosphere at high speed			1
these heat the air around them , causing the characteristic streak of light seen from the ground			0
they mostly appear as fleeting flashes lasting less than a second , but the brightest ones leave behind trails of vaporised gases and glowing air molecules that may take a few seconds to fade			0
wish upon a star : if you 're lucky bright meteors like this one seen during the 2009 @entity17 shower will shoot through the sky leaving visible trails spectacular : the annual meteor shower is a result of material falling from the tail of @entity24 stars gazers will need only their own eyes to enjoy the natural occurrence , which is a result of material falling from the tail of @entity24 , which last passed near the @entity13 in 1992			1
' @entity24 wo n’t be visiting our neck of the woods again until the year 2125 , but every year we get this beautiful reminder as the @entity13 ploughs through the debris it leaves in its orbit ' said professor @entity134 of @entity135			0
' every meteor is a speck of comet dust vaporising as it enters our atmosphere at 36 miles per second			0
what a glorious way to go			0
' starry eyed ! a meteor of the @entity17 meteor shower burns up in the atmosphere behind a catholic church near the village of @entity147 , some 100 km from @entity148 , @entity149 falling to earth : a long exposure image showing a @entity17 meteor ( left ) streaking across the night sky over @entity155 medieval church near the village of @entity157 tonight and the early hours of tomorrow morning are the peak times to spot a meteor , as the shower crosses into the earth 's atmosphere astonishing : a @entity17 meteor streaks across the sky yesterday in @entity165 , @entity166			1
the annual display is a result of @entity13 's orbit passing through debris from the comet @entity24			1

perseid reached a peak early yesterday with up to 60 shooting stars an hour
annual event lit up the sky last night and in the early hours of yesterday
the shower is a result of material falling from the tail of @entity24
