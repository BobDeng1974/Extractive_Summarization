mr @entity3 asked to have the honour removed after the @entity13 claimed he was the ' architect of the strategy that set the course for disaster ' in his handling of the bank			1
the decision to cancel his knighthood , bestowed on him back in december 2006 , was announced in the @entity21			1
@entity21 , the official journal of record , said : ' @entity24 dated 11 june 2013 have passed the @entity25 and annulling the @entity26 conferred upon @entity27 on the 6 december 2006 as a @entity28			0
' following the commission 's report back in april , mr @entity3 announced he would give up 30 per cent of his £ 580,000 - a - year pension and stood down from roles with catering firm @entity33 and private equity firm @entity34			1
he was given a knighthood after leaving @entity4 in 2006 , but following the report said he believed ' it is right that i should now ask the appropriate authorities to take the necessary steps for its removal '			1
responding to the report in april he said it made for ' very chastening reading '			2
he added : ' although i stood down as ceo of @entity4 in 2006 , some three years before it was taken over by @entity47 , i have never sought to disassociate myself from what has happened			2
' he added : ' i am deeply sorry for what happened at @entity4			0
' for a knighthood to be withdrawn , the @entity51 has to make a recommendation to the prime minister , who then passes it on to the @entity56 for a decision			0
honour : mr @entity3 had originally been given a knighthood after leaving @entity4 back in 2006 shamed : former @entity61 head @entity60 was stripped of his knighthood for his involvement in the financial crash last year @entity66 sources had said earlier this year that mandarins would have no choice but to recommend that the @entity56 remove honours from bankers in charge during the financial crash			1
@entity66 's @entity51 stripped former @entity61 boss @entity60 of his knighthood last year			1
it was understood that the @entity51 would consider the honours of sir @entity75 , former chairman of @entity76 , who presided over the takeover of @entity4 and that of @entity78 , the former @entity4 chairman			0
the @entity79 ruled that responsibility for the near - collapse of the bank ‘ lies particularly with @entity78 ’			0
while he can not be stripped of his peerage by the committee , the knighthood he received in 1997 could be at risk			0
but insiders admit it will be ‘ much more difficult ’ to target him because the honour was not awarded for banking			0
so far @entity93 , head of @entity4 corporate banking from 2006 to 2008 , is the only man to have been punished over the @entity4 scandal			2
he was fined £ 500,000 last year and banned for life from working in the @entity97 .			0

@entity3 was made a knight back in 2006 when he left @entity4

the cancellation of his knighthood follows that of @entity60 last year
