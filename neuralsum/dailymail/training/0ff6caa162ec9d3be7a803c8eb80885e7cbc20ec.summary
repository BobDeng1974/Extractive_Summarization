most people know that feeling of dread when something they use every day breaks			0
do you attempt to repair it , using up precious time , or just give up and replace it , wasting precious money ? or , as these @entity10 disasters show , you could use up neither time nor money and instead opt for the quick - fix solution by repairing the item using whatever is to hand			2
broken chair leg ? no problem , simply prop it up with an empty @entity18 bottle			0
lost your pizza cutter ? nothing that a ruler and a tin lid ca n't fix			0
from the weird , to the wonderful , to the downright dangerous , these images show what happens when broken objects fall into the hands of the chronically lazy			1
. ? time for a new clock : instead of replacing this broken timepiece , some genius decided to draw the missing numbers on paper and stick them to the wall that sinking feeling : while this bathroom sink is in desperate need of some screws to stop it falling off the wall , a stack of books and an old chair will have to do for now driving me spare : after suffering a puncture , this have - a - go motorist has attempted to fix his car by putting a child 's cart underneath the rear wheel budget birthday : with no candles to hand , this lucky birthday girl had to make do with a cigarette stuck into the top of her cake half - baked idea : with the cooker out of action , this amateur chef decided to heat up a portion of squid rings using an electric heater and a fork ... or you could just knock : guests at this household might want to avoid this advice or they could be in for a rather shocking welcome tap 's the way to do it : why bother replacing the broken spout in the bathroom , when a bit of sellotape and a bulldog clip produces the same results ? legless : an empty @entity18 bottle resting underneath what appears to be some poker chips are the only things keeping this chair from falling over broke brake lights : this cheap - skate has tried to avoid getting their car lights fixed by installing this handy switch instead ido n't believe it : with the latest smartphones costing hundreds of pounds to buy , this woman saved herself some money on her cameraphone broom broom : this car - owner has found an ingenious way of clearing the snow off their windshield without having to break out the ice scraper a cut above the rest : having lost their pizza cutter , this clever chef decided to make one out of a ruler and the top of a tin can instead not doing a hole lot of good : repairing a fence would normally take time and effort but somebody did without both and botched the job with bungee chords instead not the brightest spark : instead of buying new headlight bulbs this driver decided to sellotape a pair of torches to his bonnet instead ice and easy : when planning a romantic evening , it can be easy to forget to buy ice to chill the wine			1
no matter , spare popsicles will do the job just as well water way to do it : one green - fingered genius creates a cheap garden sprinkler after attaching an empty water bottle to car wheels before peppering it with holes a cool hang - out : this air conditioner is left dangling from the ceiling by wires after the casing holding it in place broke and the owner could n't be bothered to fix it sticky situation : a plunger is put to good use as a door stopper as part of this photo collection put together by on the @entity151 blog			2
