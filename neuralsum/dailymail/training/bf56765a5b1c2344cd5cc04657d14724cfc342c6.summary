memory loss : forgetting where you put your keys or someone 's name is a perfectly normal part of the aging process and well underway by the age of 40 , scientists have said forgetting where you put your keys or someone 's name is a perfectly normal part of the aging process and well underway by the age of 40 , scientists have said			1
experts have found that cognitive decline speeds up once people reach middle age , however , they are working on a solution to the problem			1
they believe the answer lies in the @entity23 receptors in the brain , in particular the receptors @entity27 subunits which help people to remember things			1
these subunits start to be lost among small children , and by the time a person reaches retirement age they will have around half the amount of someone much younger			2
separate this loss from more serious problems like dementia and alzheimer 's disease , virtually everyone loses memory - making and cognitive abilities as they age			1
researchers at the @entity44 at @entity45 have clarified that cognitive decline with age is a natural part of life and are searching hard to find ways of slowing it			1
' these are biological processes , and once we fully understand what is going on , we may be able to slow or prevent it , ' said @entity56 , a neuroscientist in the @entity57 of @entity58 and professor in the @entity44			0
' there may be ways to influence it with diet , health habits , continued mental activity or even drugs			2
' professor @entity56 added : ' the @entity68 receptor has been known of for decades			0
it plays a role in memory and learning but is n't active all the time , it takes a fairly strong stimulus of some type to turn it on and allow you to remember something			0
' the routine of getting dressed in the morning is ignored and quickly lost to the fog of time , but the day you had an auto accident earns a permanent etching in your memory			0
' within the @entity68 receptor are various subunits , and research , published in the @entity86 , keeps pointing back to the @entity87 as one of the most important			0
knowledge : infants and children have lots of @entity27 subunits , and as a result are like a sponge in soaking up memories and learning new things infants and children have lots of them , and as a result are like a sponge in soaking up memories and learning new things			1
but they gradually dwindle in number with age , and it also appears the ones that are left work less efficiently			0
she said : ' you can still learn new things and make new memories when you are older , but it 's not as easy			2
' fewer messages get through , fewer connections get made , and your brain has to work harder			0
' scientists have used a genetic therapy in laboratory mice , in which a virus helped carry complementary dna into appropriate cells and restored some @entity27 subunits			1
tests showed that it helped mice improve their memory and cognitive ability			2
slowing the process : the best advice for maintaining cognitive function is to keep using your brain , and get physical exercise however such gene therapy would probably be a last choice for humans , rather than a first option , as dietary or drug options would be explored first			1
professor @entity56 said : ' until more specific help is available , some of the best advice for maintaining cognitive function is to keep using your brain			1
' break old habits , do things different ways			0
get physical exercise , maintain a good diet and ensure social interaction			2
' such activities help keep these subunits active and functioning			0
' the one thing that does seem fairly clear is that cognitive decline is not inevitable , it 's biological			1
' we 're finding out why it happens , and it appears there are ways we might be able to slow or stop it , perhaps repair the @entity68 receptors			0
if we can determine how to do that without harm , we will			0

experts found cognitive decline speeds up when people reach middle age
the brain 's @entity23 receptors lose @entity27 subunits as we get older
*reseachers* at @entity45 say memory loss is part of the aging process , but in the *future* it could be slowed down with diet or drugs
using your brain or physical activity can improve cognitive function
