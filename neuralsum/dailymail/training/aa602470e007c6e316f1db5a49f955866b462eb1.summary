this is the ' incredible ' moment humpback dolphins were caught on camera strand - feeding in @entity3 for the first time			1
the footage was caught by marine researcher dr @entity6 and his team as part of a long running study by @entity10			1
it shows the dolphin beaching itself on a mud bank to catch fish which have been washed up from the river			0
dr @entity6 said it was large splashes in the distance that attracted the team 's attention to the rare behaviour			0
this is the first time footage showing humpback dolphins strand - feeding in the estuary on the @entity27 professor @entity28 from @entity29 said the event was ' significant ' this amazing image shows a group of dolphins strand - feeding is the @entity35 he said : '' we soon realised we were witnessing an incredible event			1
the humpback dolphins were observed swimming a few metres away from and parallel to the shoreline			1
' this behaviour probably allows dolphins to concentrate fish against the mud bank before charging at them at high speed			0
' on some occasions the fish were washed onto the shoreline by the wave of water associated with the dolphin 's beaching , resulting in a full body exposed beaching			2
dr @entity6 , originally from @entity56 , has been been studying the dolphins of @entity58 for a decade ' on other occasions the stranding was only partial with more than half of their body exposed			2
' in these shallow waters the agility of the dolphin 's neck region enabled them to reach for the stranded fish before sliding back into the deeper water , thanks to the soft mud substrate			2
' the fish being ' rounded up ' by the dolphins were sea mullet			0
this is the biggest study of its kind looking into rare dolphin species in @entity58			0
this is the biggest study of its kind looking into rare dolphin species in in the @entity58 region dr @entity6 leads the @entity82 at @entity10 and he explained dolphins around the world use a number of foraging strategies			1
' one of the most spectacular and rare behaviours is the ' strand - feeding ' or ' intentional beach hunting ' which involves one or more dolphins surging partially or fully out of the water and onto the beach to catch a single fish , ' he said			1
these dolphins are in the @entity27 which is one of @entity3 's largest rivers and is a tide - dominated estuary			1
@entity99 says it is ' really important ' we know and understand as much as possible about the dolphins the area features a network of narrow deep creeks and channels with steep muddy edges , providing the perfect habitat for the display of this behaviour			0
researchers from overseas are also taking part in the investigation into the declining dolphin population			1
@entity99 , 23 , from a small village in rural @entity116 has made the trip @entity118 especially to study the dolphins			0
@entity120 described it as an ' incredible experience ' to witness the strandfeeding she told 7.30 @entity58 : ' it is really important because the more we know then we can understand what changes will impact them and how the population will change			0
@entity131 photographer @entity120 , from @entity132 , @entity130 has been out in @entity58 for the last two months taking part in the study			2
she said : ' the snubfin dolphin was only found to be a new species in 2005 so there is still a lot to learn , in the last two months i have witnessed the strand - feeding and it is something new			1
students from @entity10 in @entity58 tracking the progress of the dolphins ' it was an incredible experience to watch , it was something i have only witnessed on documentaries			0
' dr @entity6 said : ' you need to be in the right place at the right time ( to see the dolphins ) , it is not easy			2
' @entity152 , @entity153 assistant chief executive , told 7.30 @entity58 : '' he ( dr @entity6 ) is now known as an expert in looking after the dolphin populations in the local are			0
@entity131 photographer @entity120 , from @entity132 , @entity130 has been out in @entity58 for two months ' we have got a lot of statistics over the years and he is gathering great data that will be used for many years to come			0
' professor @entity28 , director of the university 's @entity162 , said the observation by the @entity82 was ' significant '			0
' these new observations of complex feeding behaviours in inshore dolphins highlights the lack of knowledge we have about key aspects of the ecology and biology of these important dolphins and most other cetacean species in @entity3 waters			1
' the study has also found the region 's humpback dolphins , previously known as the @entity180 dolphin species , have dropped from around 200 to 150 .			1

it is the first time humpback dolphins have been captured on video strand - feeding in @entity3
@entity131 researcher dr @entity186 began the tracking pods almost a decade *ago* and spends 10 hours a *day* on the water
the long running study shows the area 's declining dolphin population has gone from 200 to 150
