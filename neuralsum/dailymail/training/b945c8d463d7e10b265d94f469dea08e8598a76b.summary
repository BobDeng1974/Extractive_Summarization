by @entity0 if ever you needed comfort food , it would probably be when you ’re isolated in the vast expanse of space			0
far away from loved ones and anything that resembles home , astronauts have long craved the type of food that can usually cure a hangover			2
so when a @entity16 cosmonaut said that what he ’d really like on the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) was ‘ fried potatoes ’ , @entity14 researchers set about to make it happen			1
the space snack that will never be : @entity14 researchers claim that frying chips in space would cause them to be soggy rather than crispy because there is no convection in zero gravity their initial experiments , funded by the @entity29 , revealed that it was possible to make chips at forces three times the normal force of gravity			1
but in a recent paper , the researchers said that despite their early success , fried chips would in fact be soggy if they were made on the @entity18 researcher @entity39 began his experiments by using a giant centrifuge to cook chips under conditions of hypergravity , which is when the force of gravity is more than that on @entity48			1
researcher @entity39 began by using a giant centrifuge to cook chips under conditions of hypergravity			2
he found that at a force of 3 - g ( three times the gravity of @entity48 ) the potatoes formed a perfect crispy crust in around half the usual time			1
standard centrifuge machine is pictured frying chips in space would leave them soggy rather than crispy , according to researchers			1
this is because for frying and boiling , convection is an essential part of the process			0
the way the liquid , such as oil and water , circulates effects the rate at which foods heat up			0
on @entity48 , the hot liquid at the base of a pan rises because it ’s not as dense as the cooler liquid above			0
this convection wo n’t happen in zero gravity causing soggy fries without a crust			1
while we may be getting closer to unlocking the secrets of @entity84 , we ’re still no closer to discovering how to make @entity86 fries in space			2
he found that at a force of 3 - g , which is three times the gravity of @entity48 , the potatoes formed a perfect crispy crust in around half the usual time			1
while the chips may not have tasted out of this world , they tasted as good as those fried normally			0
the professor , from the @entity99 , said the same effect could be achieved by creating an industrial fryer that spins once a second or a home fryer that rotates twice a second , and he plans to patent a design			0
at the time , professor @entity39 said he suspects that the potatoes would boil rather than fry in space and added : ‘ it will be important to know whether we can fry on @entity84 or the moon			2
’ but as @entity112 at @entity113 noted , fried chips would be problematic on @entity114 is because for frying and boiling , convection is an essential part of the process			1
the way the liquid , such as oil and water , circulates effects the rate at which foods heat up			0
on @entity48 , the hot liquid at the base of a pan rises because it ’s not as dense as the cooler liquid above			0
this convection wo n’t happen in zero gravity causing soggy fries without a crust			2
so while we may be getting closer to unlocking the secrets of @entity84 , we ’re still no closer to discovering how to make @entity86 fries in space			0
the chip experiments are funded by the @entity29 and follow comments from a @entity16 cosmonaut that what he 'd really like is ' fried potatoes '			1
here , astronauts eat a meal on board the @entity145			0

experiment began when @entity16 cosmonaut said he craved ' fried potatoes '
but lack of convection to *transport* heat in space would make chips soggy
at force of 3 - g , however , fried chips have been shown to form a perfect crispy crust in around half the usual time
