by @entity0 a woman whose stomach was so swollen she thought she was pregnant has told of her horror after discovering she was carrying a 5st ovarian cyst			1
@entity6 , 44 , desperately wanted a family but was left heartbroken when doctors told her , and her husband @entity9 , they were unlikely to conceive naturally			1
mrs @entity6 , from @entity10 , tipped the scales at 21st and wore size 24 dresses			1
@entity6 had such a swollen stomach ( left ) she was convinced she was pregnant			1
she was devastated to be told she actually had a huge ovarian cyst that had to be removed			1
she is pictured ( right ) after it was removed but she refused @entity18 treatment and instead threw herself into slimming to a healthier weight in the hope of conceiving			0
however , in august last year mrs @entity6 was baffled when she struggled to even fit into a bigger size 26 and her waistline continued to expand despite months of dieting and losing 2st			1
she rushed to her gp hoping her growing bump was a miracle baby , but after a pregnancy test came back negative she was referred to specialists who discovered a huge ovarian cyst			1
she said : ‘ @entity9 and i had almost given up hope of having children , but when our doctor suggested @entity18 , we decided not to go down that route and hoped it would happen on its own			1
‘ at 21st i knew i had to do something about my weight to help my chances			2
‘ so , i joined a diet class and started eating a healthier diet and within a few months i 'd lost 2st			1
during surgery to remove the cyst , mrs @entity6 had to have 32 litres of fluid drained from her stomach			1
she also had to have a hysterectomy			2
she is pictured after the cyst was removed ‘ i went out to buy a new outfit to celebrate			2
i had been a size 24 so i picked up a size 22 , hoping it would now fit comfortably			1
‘ but i could n't get into it as around my middle was too big and i had to go up to a size 26			1
‘ it was so noticeable that people at work thought i was pregnant and kept asking when i was due			2
‘ so i went to see my gp , who was convinced at first i was pregnant			1
an ovarian cyst is a fluid - filled sac that develops on a woman 's ovary			1
they are very common and do not usually cause any symptoms			0
in most cases , they are harmless and usually disappear without the need for treatment			0
however , if the cyst is large or causing symptoms , it may need to be surgically removed			2
an ovarian cyst will usually only cause symptoms if it ruptures , is very large , or if it blocks the blood supply to the ovaries			2
in this case , symptoms can include pelvic pain , urinating frequently , a change to menstruation , bloating and tiredness			0
source : @entity85 ‘ but when a pregnancy test proved negative i knew there was something more sinister lurking			1
‘ i was referred to hospital where i had a biopsy , a ct scan and an ultra sound			0
‘ finally a specialist told me that i had a huge ovarian cyst , which from the scan they could see was filled with fluid			1
‘ they told me if i did n't have it removed i could die			0
’ devastated , mrs @entity6 was forced to undergo a full hysterectomy at @entity10 's @entity102 where medics drained more than 32 litres of fluid from her stomach			1
she said : ‘ at the hospital , i had to have my operation in the maternity unit			0
i was really sad , but i knew i just had to deal with the fact i would n't be having children			2
‘ i knew what was involved in the operation , but i just wanted it gone			0
’ mrs @entity6 shed more than 5st overnight after the growth was successfully removed			2
she said : ‘ the doctors said it was too risky to remove it whole so it had to be drained			0
‘ @entity120 , there was a chance it could come back in my other ovary so i finally consented to a full hysterectomy			0
‘ i went under the knife and said goodbye to having children once and for all			0
mrs @entity6 ( pictured with her husband , @entity9 ) was devastated to be told she needed a hysterectomy as she was desperate to have children - but she says she is also grateful to be alive ‘ the doctor drained 32 litres of fluid and removed the lump			1
‘ waking up from the op , i felt much better and the following day weighed myself			0
‘ at that point i 'd been 19st and after having the lump removed i was now down to 14st			0
‘ it was unbelievable i 'd been carrying around all that weight			0
‘ i 've now accepted that children are not on the cards for me			0
mrs @entity6 lost 5st in weight during the operation to remove her cyst and have fluid drained from her abdomen ‘ but things could have been so much worse			1
i 'm lucky to be alive			0

@entity6 , 44 , decided to diet after struggling to conceive
she weighed 21st and was wearing size 24 dresses
she lost 2st but was then *shocked* to find she needed size 26 dresses
her stomach became so bloated she was convinced she was pregnant
after a negative pregnancy test , she was *diagnosed* with a huge cyst
she had to have surgery to remove it and to drain 32 litres of fluid
she also had to have a hysterectomy so will not be able to have children
