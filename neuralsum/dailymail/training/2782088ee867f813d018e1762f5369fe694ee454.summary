@entity0 are n’t supposed to be like this			0
billed as the classic battle between the @entity4 ’s finest offense and defense , the @entity1 annihilated the @entity6 on both sides of the ball to win the franchise ’s first @entity9			1
@entity11 ’s @entity6 were dissected , dismantled and destroyed by the brutal , relentless assault			1
it was as one - sided as the 43 - 8 scoreline suggests			1
video see below for dramatic highlights from the @entity1 ' @entity0 triumph leader : @entity20 was brilliant in @entity22 's dominating win over the @entity6 winners ! @entity1 head coach @entity24 lifts the @entity9 after a brilliant win disappointment : @entity11 holds his head in his hand after a shocking defeat at @entity29 drenched : @entity24 is covered in juice by his players - a tradition in @entity34 sports read all about it : media surround @entity20 as his team - mates hold up monday 's newspapers ticker tape : players and fans are showered with ticker tape at the end of the game mvp : @entity46 was named the game 's @entity47 debate will rage on the future of the recently - crowned five - time mvp after another failure on the biggest stage			1
that is for another day , but the 37 - year old now has a @entity0 record of 1 - 2 after @entity56 , @entity57 hurried and hassled him all night			2
but all the focus should be on @entity24 ’s magnificent @entity22			1
no player on the roster had played at a @entity0 before , but the self - styled @entity61 enacted the classic way to win championships : a mean , nasty defense which unsettles and suffocates opponents , thriving on pressure and creating turnovers			0
they forced four turnovers , and both of @entity11 ’s interceptions resulted in touchdowns			1
@entity0 mvp @entity46 returned an interception for 69 yards and was part of a pass rush that made @entity11 give his best impression of a cat on a hot tin roof			1
he also recovered a fumble and made nine tackles			0
near perfect : @entity20 was brilliant in @entity22 's victory worst start : the @entity6 gave up a safety in the very first play of the game after a botched snap picked off : @entity87 intercepts @entity11 's wayward pass pick six : @entity46 returned an interception for a 69 - yard touchdown beast mode : @entity92 is handed the ball and makes his way into the endzone for a touchdown and @entity20 , in just his second @entity4 season , was outstanding , protecting the ball , scrambling in his trademark style and targeting his underrated receiving corps on the move			1
@entity102 , who had played just two games during an injury - hit season , scampered for a kick - off return and made multiple vital receptions			0
@entity92 , spearhead of @entity22 ’s bruising running game , managed just 39 yards			0
but as the @entity6 focused on stopping him down the centre , @entity20 utitilised his receiving corps			1
@entity111 , the explosive @entity102 and @entity112 were all targeted as the @entity1 relentlessly advanced downfield			2
@entity22 ’s sensational shutdown corner @entity113 , so vocal before the game , had a quiet night			0
and his evening ended in unceremonious fashion with an ankle injury			0
the margin of victory was the greatest for 21 years , but it still failed to do @entity22 ’s dominance justice			0
they were unstoppable , reducing @entity6 ’s fabled offense - the best in history , remember - to broken men			0
they did n’t reach the end zone until the game had a quarter left			0
huge return : @entity102 returned the second half kick - off for a touchdown to dampen @entity6 hopes disbelief : @entity11 ca n't believe how the game unfolded bullied : @entity112 broke four tackles on his way to a touchdown perhaps we should have known it was n’t the @entity6 ’ night after just 12 seconds			1
@entity143 ’s poor return from @entity145 ’s kick - off put them on their 14 - yard line			1
a miscommunication saw center @entity150 snapping the ball while @entity11 was not in position , his face contorting in horror as the ball sailed over his head			2
@entity157 helplessly scrambled backwards but he could not avoid the flying @entity158 in the end zone			0
for the second time in three years the first @entity0 score was a safety			0
the misery conned to pile on @entity11			2
his offensive line , so effective this season , was suddenly porous he failed to get so much as a first down in the first quarter			0
and when he get the ball in his hands , he did n’t have it for long			0
@entity87 intercepted his high pass and another sweeping @entity22 drive - kept alive by a pass interference penalty from @entity171 - resulted in a trademark burst over the line from @entity92 from a yard			2
desperately for time on the field , @entity6 needed a sustained drive but they did n’t get one			0
@entity158 made mincemeat out of right tackle @entity179 and charged into @entity11 ’s right arm			2
face palm : @entity20 hands off veteran cornerback @entity182 all over : @entity183 dives for the touchdown after more missed tackles from the @entity6 the ball spiralled into the grateful arms of @entity46 , who darted to the endzone			1
with the score at 22 - 0 , the half - time crooning of @entity190 could n’t come quickly enough for the @entity6			0
but as the @entity192 blasted out give it away now , @entity6 did so again immediately after the break			0
with the 12th man in full voice , @entity22 managed to score 12 seconds into second half now as the turbo - heeled @entity102 skipped through for a breathtaking 87 - yard touchdown			1
with @entity24 furiously encouraging on the sidelines , the @entity1 continued to run up the score			1
after a magnificent catch , @entity112 avoided multiple woeful tackles to skip over for a 23 - yard touchdown reception			1
@entity204 ensured the @entity6 would not suffer the ultimate ignominy by being the first team to end a @entity0 scoreless , collecting a 14 - yard pass from @entity11			1
@entity209 , whose @entity0 misery continued , completed the two - point conversion			0
again , @entity22 were relentless			0
@entity111 , who skinned multiple pro bowler @entity182 all night , caught @entity20 ’s 10 - yard pass to complete the rout			1
astonishingly , @entity6 set two records with @entity11 usurping @entity215 with 33 completions in a @entity0			2
@entity204 collected 13 passes , beating team - mate @entity209			2
but that will mean nothing to a franchise - and a quarterback - who were humiliated by opponents who could be on the way to establishing a dynasty of their own			2
show stopper : @entity190 ( above ) and the @entity192 ( below ) performed at half - time wrapping up : former @entity0 winner @entity228 was at the game here they come : thunder the horse leads the @entity6 onto @entity232 entrance : the @entity1 make their way onto the field pre-game performance : queen @entity237 sings @entity238 the beautiful before kick - off pre-game show : band members spell out @entity34 during a routine			1

@entity1 dominate from first to last in one - sided *showpiece*
@entity11 throws two interceptions and also has a fumble
@entity20 near - perfect throwing two touchdown passes
@entity46 named @entity252 after returning interception for 69 - yard touchdown
@entity24 leads franchise to first ever @entity9
