@entity0 raised eyebrows when they paid £ 28million for @entity4 's @entity3 front man @entity2			1
while the 26 - year - old 's quality is not in doubt , his transfer fee is high considering he is unlikely to be available until february , and even then will probably be fourth choice			0
but @entity0 fan @entity9 of www.90min.com believes @entity2 could be just the player to help the club retain their @entity13 crown			1
@entity2 , 26 , joined @entity0 on a four - and - a - half - year deal , he will wear the @entity16 shirt @entity2 poses with the no 14 @entity0 shirt after completing his £ 25m switch to the @entity19 they say that £ 28m is a lot of money for a fourth - choice striker , but i think @entity2 deserves a bit more credit than that			1
no player scored more goals than him during the last calendar year and the @entity3 forward is not some flash - in - the - pan striker ; he ’s managed to find the net wherever he ’s been and his goalscoring record proves that			1
you can argue there ’s a fair bit of wilderness between the @entity40 league and @entity42 ’s elite competition , where the striker is heading if @entity44 can successfully mastermind a win over @entity46 in the @entity47 – but either way @entity2 scores goals because he ’s smart			1
whether he make the step up to @entity47 football so quickly and how @entity0 overcome @entity46 remains to be seen , but on paper @entity0 fans should have no reason to doubt his quality			2
@entity2 is quick , strong and powerful			2
yet , somewhat unfairly , his best qualities are often overlooked			0
his first touch is exceptional - i suppose it has to be when leading the line for someone of @entity4 ’s ilk - whether it ’s with his head , chest or his preferred route ; into feet , contrary to popular belief			2
@entity2 ( posing with @entity3 president @entity66 ) has completed his move to @entity0 his movement is also first - class ; perhaps the reason he scores as many as he does and why @entity70 has more league assists this season than he managed in two years at @entity73			1
and keep an eye on his finishing ; while the power is there if he needs it , he ’s equally capable of selling a goalkeeper with his eyes and tucking one neatly inside his far corner			0
as far as i ’m concerned , he ’s an ox with a strong grasp of ballet			0
already though , there are doubts over the @entity3 ’s future at the @entity19 , both long and short - @entity89 starters , due to international commitments , we are unlikely to see him until mid-february at the earliest - even his unveiling took place under the beaming @entity95 sun ! let ’s assume the the elephants reach the final of this year ’s @entity99 , then perhaps we could pencil in a potential debut in the @entity102 fifth round - somewhere around @entity103			1
that ’s also envisaging the @entity105 beat @entity106 in a week and a bit ’s time			0
@entity2 ( pictured here at the @entity109 ) is currently away at the @entity99 with the @entity3 the striker leaves @entity4 for £ 25million and will earn £ 100,000 - a - week in wages you ’d hope that @entity113 will be banging them in again by then , with @entity115 back too in all likelihood			1
@entity2 will already be playing catch - up			2
but even if we do n’t see too much of him before the season ’s out , there ’s no need to panic			0
dzeko himself was a january addition and scored only two goals from eight league starts in his first - half season			0
the @entity128 scored 14 the year after , 14 after that and 16 last term - all from a maximum of 23 starts ( 2013/14 ) - and i ’ve no doubts that @entity2 will deliver too , whether it ’s now or a year or so down the line			2
consider that @entity0 paid around £ 23m for @entity136 - a second striker whose highest ever league goals tally is 14 - then £ 28m for @entity2 does n’t seem quite so steep			1
the @entity3 need n't worry about his future at the club			0
@entity136 , on the other hand , i ’m not so sure about			0
in my eyes it could prove to be a very shrewd signing by @entity44 , especially with the games coming think and fast between now and the end of the season			0
@entity2 could well prove the difference in the title race			0
