moms who are against vaccinating their children have responded to the backlash against them , suggesting they are a ' medical choice ' that ' should be researched carefully '			1
three mothers — all of them educated , middle - class professionals — are among the skeptics who have been widely ridiculed since more than 100 people fell ill in a measles outbreak traced to @entity10			1
critics question their intelligence , their parenting , even their sanity			1
some have been called criminals for foregoing shots for their children that are overwhelmingly shown to be safe and effective			1
' contrary to the common sentiment , we are not anti-science , ' said @entity21 , a businesswoman who lives in the affluent @entity23 suburb of @entity24 with her 2½ - year - old twin girls			1
' i 'm not opposed to medicine , and i think vaccines have a place			1
we think it 's a medical choice , and it should be researched carefully			2
but a handful of mothers agreed to discuss their thinking			2
@entity21 , an @entity50 graduate who runs an agriculture - related business , traces her feelings back to the time she took @entity54 , a supposedly safe anti-malaria medication			1
instead , she said , the drug saddled her with multiple health complications			2
she questions whether the government knew about the risks at the time			0
health officials now acknowledge @entity54 can cause severe side effects , some of which can be permanent			0
that experience broke @entity21 's trust in the medical establishment and launched her on years of research into how vaccines can affect people 's health			1
when she got pregnant , @entity21 and her husband delayed immunization for @entity34 and @entity35			1
' it was not an easy decision , ' she said			0
' the thought of something happening to them because we chose not to vaccinate is terrifying			0
but i have so many questions , and i do think it 's the right decision for our family			0
' @entity84 of @entity85 , @entity86 , says people who share her opinions ' are being vilified and ostracized			1
' @entity84 , a vice president at a bank , told her daughter about her doubts			0
then her daughter and her husband looked into the issue , and they decided not to immunize their two children			1
' in a community with many young people , those who do n't vaccinate are feeling a lot of pressure , ' she said			1
nationwide , parents who seek an exemption from vaccine requirements are still in a tiny minority			0
the median total exemption rate for kindergartners during the 2013 - 14 school year was just 1.8 percent , according to the @entity108			0
but some individual schools or communities have higher exemption rates , at times approaching 60 percent or more			0
@entity113 , left , of @entity114 , @entity86 , holds her daughter @entity115 , four months , as she waits to testify against @entity116 that would remove personal or philosophical opposition as an acceptable reason for parents to not vaccinate their school - age children the @entity108 says years of testing are required before a vaccine is approved , and the shots are continually monitored for safety and effectiveness			2
anti-vaccination parents include a mix of views — from religious communities to families practicing alternative medicine and libertarians who shun government interference			0
but many are @entity136 with college degrees living in liberal communities such as @entity139 or @entity140 in @entity141 and @entity23 , said @entity142 , a professor of pediatrics at the @entity144			0
most hesitant parents do not avoid all vaccinations			0
they typically under - vaccinate , either delaying the shots until their child is older or refusing certain vaccines while continuing with others , @entity142 said			2
the parents who spoke to @entity46 recounted spending hundreds of hours reviewing medical studies , books and news stories and networking on social media			0
they cited cases of children who were supposedly hurt by vaccines and the existence of a government - run vaccine injury - compensation program			1
and they worried about the oversight of pharmaceutical companies that reap profits from vaccines and are shielded from liability when a vaccine causes harm			2
@entity21 said she read a 1998 study published in the @entity171 journal by dr. @entity172 , who raised the possibility of a link between the measles - mumps - rubella vaccine , bowel disease and autism			1
she said she knows the study was later discredited and retracted			0
she believes the research was inconclusive			2
@entity21 concedes that the vast majority of studies show vaccines are safe , but she says some research points to inconsistencies , unknowns or negative effects that deserve further investigation			1
and while autism is still a concern , @entity21 and others also worry about how exposure to chemicals , bad nutrition and stress can affect genes and health			1
they say large doses of synthetic additives found in vaccines , including aluminum and mercury , can harm the immune and digestive systems and brain			2
they 're believers in living naturally and eating organic food who also question the safety of genetically modified organisms , pesticides and other common substances such as flame retardants and plastics			0
' there are so many environmental toxins , but anything in my children 's world that i can influence i do , ' @entity21 said			1
the @entity108 has phased out a mercury - containing preservative in vaccines as a precautionary measure , and the agency says vaccines containing aluminum pose extremely low risk to infants			1
federal officials also say gmos in foods are safe , as are pesticides if used according to labels			0
more than 100 people have fallen ill as a result of the outbreak at @entity10 - prompting anti-vaxxers to be vilified and ostracized these parents say they should be able to decide whether their child undergoes a medical procedure — a decision , they say , that goes to the core of what it means to have freedom of choice			1
' i have the right to decide what to put into my child 's body , ' said @entity251 , a mom in @entity252 , @entity253 , who is also a registered nurse			0
' nobody has the right to put toxic chemicals into my son 's bloodstream			0
that 's taking my rights away , and it 's very scary to me			0
' @entity251 said she decided against vaccinating because her first child was born a preemie and has autism			0
@entity251 does not believe vaccines caused the autism , but the disease led her to do a lot of research about health			2
she says she now chooses to build her son 's immunity naturally , through diet , while avoiding shots or other medication			0
@entity251 and others say they are not worried about measles because their children have strong immune systems			2
they cite statistics : out of the 1,000 - plus measles cases in the past decade , there was not a single death			0
' what i 'm more nervous about is the hysteria that would result , ' if her children were to get ill , @entity21 said			1
@entity21 said she does worry about affecting children who are immune - compromised and can not be vaccinated			1
before visiting friends with babies or young children , she said , she always informs them her twins are not vaccinated ' so they have the power to make a choice			2
' she also keeps the girls home at any sign of sickness			0
researchers say berating parents who oppose vaccines will not persuade anyone and only puts people on the defensive			1
educational messages from health officials may also make little difference and could , in fact , be counterproductive , said @entity310 , assistant professor of government at @entity312			0
a study conducted by @entity310 and his colleagues last year showed that when parents were presented with evidence that vaccines do not cause autism or that measles cause great harm , some ended up feeling even more ambivalent			2
' we tend to be skeptical toward information that contradicts our existing views , ' @entity310 said			0
if @entity325 were to take away the right to a vaccine exemption , @entity21 said , she would likely home - school her twins			1
she 's keeping an open mind about vaccinating as her children get older , but hopes more studies on the long - term effects of vaccines can help dispel her doubts			1
' i worry about living in a society that 's progressively more intolerant toward any dissent , ' @entity21 said			1
' all scientific advances have come from questioning the status quo			0

skeptics have been vilified after 100 people fell ill in outbreak
many fear they are at risk of infection from *un-vaccinated* children
critics have questioned their intelligence , parenting and their sanity
businesswoman @entity21 believes vaccines ' have a place '
