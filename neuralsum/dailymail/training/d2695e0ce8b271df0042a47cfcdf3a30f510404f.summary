a woman who experiences multiple orgasms for up to eight hours a day has opened up for the first time about her rare condition			1
@entity4 , from @entity5 , @entity6 , suffers from persistent sexual arousal syndrome , also known as persistent genital arousal disorder , which means she climaxes hundreds of times a day			1
speaking with her husband , @entity11 , she revealed that she was diagnosed with the disorder after the birth of her first child			2
' if i was n’t controlling it , i do n’t even know if i could put a number on it			2
it would be in the hundreds , ' she says			1
' they come every 30 seconds for four to six [ or ] sometimes eight hours , and i 'm sure that 's well up in the hundreds - i 'm not a math person , but i 'm sure it 's up there			1
' if i had no self - control , no willpower , i do n’t know that i would ever leave the house			2
' ' if i had no self - control , no willpower , i do n't know that i would ever leave the house ' even simple household tasks pose a hazard , she admits			2
' the washing machine , for whatever reason , when it goes on the spin cycle i do n't even like to touch it , ' she tells the camera			2
' the vibrations have a tendency to trigger the persistant sexual arousal , and it 'll trigger an episode ... i do n't sit on it , for obvious reasons			1
that , i think , would do me in			0
' for @entity11 , there are both positive and negatives to being married to a woman with persistent sexual arousal syndrome			1
double - edged sword : for @entity4 's husband @entity11 , there are both positive and negatives to being married to a woman with persistent sexual arousal syndrome ' i called it the @entity63 , ' he said , referring to a frog found in @entity66 's @entity65			1
' it does make for a fun time , because it 's not every day that women are aggressive in that way , but sometimes it is inopportune ... ' it 's a double - edged sword			1
you think you want it , until you have got it			0
' being more sexually - charged than her husband has had an emotional impact on @entity80 , too , who initially struggled when her husband refused sex			0
' at first i took it so horribly , ' she admitted			0
' when you know that there 's a way to relieve it , and you do n't have access to that way ... i just let my emotions get the better of me			0
' sometimes i was in tears , i was like , " you do n't really want me , " and stuff like that			0
it was really hard to deal with			0
' @entity96 @entity95 , an expert on sexual medicine at @entity98 in @entity99 says : persistent genital arousal disorder ( @entity101 ) is a newly recognised condition , where the sufferer complains of long periods of genital arousal that are not associated with sexual desire			1
@entity101 sufferers experience intrusive , unsolicited and spontaneous genital arousal that can be unrelenting			1
this arousal can persist for hours , days or even longer			1
this can be highly distressing for a woman and despite attempts to relieve it with sexual activity or orgasm , this often does n't help or can worsen the symptoms			1
@entity119 cysts are small jelly like cysts that form around the sacral area of the spine			0
they are a common finding in normal people			0
one current research paper suggests that a lot of women who have @entity101 have @entity119 cysts , but this is contentious			0
spontaneous genital arousal is quite common but it 's those women who ca n't control the arousal which is uncommon			2
i see around 20 women a year with this condition , it may be as common as one in 100 we just do n't know			0
sometimes it may resolve on its own , there is no cure but there are a number of ways to manage the symptoms such as meditation and pelvic floor exercises along with pain medication for the patient .			0
