by @entity0 @entity1 : 06:37 est , 19 december 2013 @entity2 : 09:30 est , 19 december 2013 ' i ca n't say exactly what 's in it because people can be naughty with it , ' explains @entity8 , product director and co-founder of experimental food group , the @entity11			1
' and it 's technically classified as a firearm			2
' but @entity8 is n't talking about bombs or guns			0
instead , she 's discussing the magic behind an invention called the ' chicken rocket ' - a device that allows you to shoot a spoonful of stuffing across a room directly into the cavity of the bird			1
it might sound bizarre but for @entity8 , exploding stuffing is all in a day 's work - and it 's not even the most unusual method of decorating food on the @entity30 's menu			1
extreme garnishing : the concept is the brainchild of the @entity30 's @entity8 and @entity33 and it 's certainly not all chickens and stuffing			1
at their extreme garnishing classes , @entity8 , and her partners , @entity33 and former child actress , @entity38 , also show students how to create cocktails that change colour , marshmallows that double as medicine and bitters that taste like @entity47 or @entity48			1
the point ? to show the world how to take food to @entity53 style extremes - and beyond			2
all the same , it 's hard to avoid mentioning the collective 's impressive dedication to things that go bang - not always with the expected result			2
' when @entity11 first started doing the explosives , he tried to make a rocket sandwich where all the ingredients hang on wires before being blown together by the explosion , ' reveals @entity8			2
' he was testing it in the back garden and it just kind of went everywhere			0
he also had an idea to blow up plastic balls , ' she continues , ' and blew up his hand but it was n't so bad - he just had bruises			0
' colourful : @entity8 says that pine or @entity77 pudding infused ' caviar ' is perfect for livening up the big day creative : workshops teach extreme garnishing and how to make the colour - changing @entity82 cocktail popular : according to @entity8 , @entity53 has helped make theatrical food a big trend in @entity85 and while the exploding sandwich went wrong , other flammable foods made the cut and are on the curriculum at the trio 's workshops			1
' the chicken rocket is pretty crazy but i think the explosive icing was probably better because it explodes like a firework and its really colourful and smoky , ' adds @entity8			1
' doing a flaming pineapple with the icing is amazing but the rocket chicken can be unreliable because if something goes wrong then you can get stuffing all over your wall ! ' while turning your turkey into the gastronomic equivalent of a land mine is n't recommended , @entity8 does have some creative ideas for making december 25th go with a bang			1
' @entity11 would probably add food colouring and glitter to everything , ' she muses , ' whereas i 'd just try and make everything bigger			2
' you can do a lot with infusing , ' she adds			0
break it down and make a bit molecular			0
fake caviar is good , pine infused or @entity77 pudding flavoured			0
' at the moment , you can go to any cocktail bar and pay £ 12 to £ 15 for a molecular cocktail but really , you can easily make them at home			0
' the great thing about molecular cocktails is that they 're easy and cheap and you can get guests to make them too			0
it 's a good way of getting guests to serve themselves ! ' it 's this that is at the root of the @entity30 's mission - putting creative food concepts into the public arena and showing that despite appearances , getting involved is not only doable but simple			1
' the whole idea behind is by taking children 's science products and making it super fun for adults , ' adds @entity8			2
' @entity53 [ @entity53 ] has helped to push the idea of food combined with a theatrical production and it 's really trendy now			1
' it 's just super easy and super fun , and the classes are just about showing people how easy it is to do things we do			0
i do n't think it will ever go away			0
' the next @entity158 workshop takes place in february			0
tickets cost £ 40 for two people and are available from @entity162 or @entity163 rocket chicken and exploding icing might be off the menu ( too dangerous for those who have n't been trained ) , but @entity168 has an exclusive recipe for those who want to make @entity77 cocktails worthy of @entity53 - cheers ! the @entity173 ( in @entity174 ) ingredients 10 tablespoons icing sugar four tablespoons powdered citric acid ( food safe ) 1.5 tablespoons baking soda one tablespoon powdered malt drink dash of cinnamon pinch of grated nutmeg edible glitter to garnish method combine all the ingredients in a bowl and mix well			1
enjoy the sherbet on it 's own , as a cocktail glass rim garnish or serve it as a dip with candy canes .			0
