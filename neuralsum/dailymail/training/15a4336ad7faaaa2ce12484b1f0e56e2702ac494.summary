among some of the other players are @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity25 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity20 and @entity54			2
@entity13 captain @entity40 is one of the majority of past and present @entity3 players implicated in the @entity6 scandal who have elected to accept the deal that will see them miss just three matches the notices handed out to players , including @entity20 ( pictured ) , will only see players miss this season 's last three games and a few weeks of next year 's training before the 2015 season begins earlier on wednesday @entity40 said if he or any other @entity1 player accept reduced bans offered by @entity6 , they 'll automatically be labelled drug cheats			1

' but then you say " let 's stuff this , we 've done nothing wrong "			0
it 's a real hard situation to be in			0
' @entity40 was unsure if the players would be offered deals and whether it could be in anyway related to @entity6 's progress in its investigation of @entity111 club @entity110 which has been hit by court action			2
' i 've asked ( my lawyer ) about that and we 're not 100 percent sure , because ( my lawyer ) believes that they 're probably going to try and back us into a corner where we have to make a decision , basically asap before the @entity110 thing is over , ' he said			0

but it 's actually happening and we 're right in the middle of it			0
it 's pretty tough to take			0
' @entity40 was adamant he had n't taken any banned substance			0
' i 'm 100 per cent positive i 've never taken anything that 's been on any banned list , ' he said			0
it was pointed out to @entity40 that , if he accepted a six - month ban , he would miss only one month of next @entity3 season , but he would also miss out on representing @entity144 in the @entity146 series later this year and potential lucrative off - season boxing bouts he hoped to have			2

' but it 's your reputation ; it 's what i 've built over the last 15 - plus years in training fulltime and getting to where i 've got to in the game			2
' it 's tarnished now already , but no matter what , if we do this we 're going to be labelled a drug cheat			0
