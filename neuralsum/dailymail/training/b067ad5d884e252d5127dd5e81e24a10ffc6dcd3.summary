i will not bow to pressure when picking my starting xi , was the gist of what @entity4 said			0
the @entity7 manager is yet to opt for @entity8 as a starting striker in the @entity10 over @entity11 and @entity12 , two players that earn significantly more but have contributed far less			1
' my decision is always about my analysis on the training , ' @entity4 insisted , asserting he rotates his strikers to give ‘ balance to the team '			0
@entity8 ( centre ) celebrates scoring @entity7 's winning goal against @entity23 on sunday @entity8 bagged a hat - trick during @entity7 's 5 - 1 against @entity25 at @entity26 last month it begs the question , what more must @entity8 do to earn his chance as @entity7 's go - to striker ? the preferred duo at @entity26 have been awol or , at the very least , not justifying the fat pay packets they receive while @entity8 is paid a fraction of the cost			1
follow all the latest # @entity38 action on : @entity39 : @entity40 @entity41 : @ @entity42 and at @entity43 and yet the club ’s current top goalscorer is regularly relegated to the substitutes ’ bench , having played just 95 minutes in six @entity10 appearances so far			2
@entity4 has been scratching his head over finding that ‘ balance ’ but the numbers tell it better			0
@entity8 this year has averaged a goal every 72.9 minutes , while @entity11 trails on 415.5 and @entity12 , 300			1
@entity54 columnist and former @entity7 midfielder @entity53 believes @entity8 has earned the right , despite being relatively new			2
‘ if you compare him to @entity11 and @entity12 there is no comparison , ’ he told @entity57			2
‘ i ’d be amazed if he does n’t start next week ( against @entity63 )			0
’ both @entity12 ( left ) and @entity11 have struggled to find the net this season @entity4 ( above ) is yet to select @entity8 as his starting striker in the @entity10 kick - off : thursday , november 6 , 6pm tv : @entity68 from 5.30pm before that , though , the man eight years younger than @entity12 and nine than @entity11 travels to @entity71 to face @entity25 in the @entity38 on thursday evening			1
the road to @entity73 is inviting to @entity8			0
it has become the @entity75 under 21 international ’s stomping ground , scoring four goals in a competition that offers @entity81 football to the winner			0
@entity8 is poised to start in @entity83 as he did against the @entity71 club at @entity26 a fortnight ago , where he scored a hat - trick before replacing goalkeeper @entity86 who was sent off			1
three days later he was dropped in favour of @entity11 as @entity7 lost 2 - 1 against @entity88 at home			1
the former @entity91 and @entity92 striker has not travelled for a @entity38 tie in more than a year , and has been left in @entity94 again			0
@entity8 ( right ) , who has scored nine goals so far this season , looks set to start on thursday night @entity12 has been a major disappointment since joining from @entity98 for £ 26m in the summer of 2013 it implies @entity25 will be another chance for the @entity7 youth product to give @entity4 food for thought			1
and yet , will it hinder him ? with @entity106 on rotation , @entity8 is poised to subsequently be overlooked for sunday ’s @entity10 match against @entity63			1
there ’s no doubting the striker ’s enthusiasm - ‘ i feel fit and ready and i feel i could play a game every day if i could , ’ he says - although @entity4 will suggest he ’s protecting a @entity112 from being burned out			0
@entity8 is n't the most technically gifted , nor is he the fastest or most skilful			0
but he has shown ability to gain half a yard on his opponent and be clinical in doing so , outshining £ 26million signing @entity12 in the process			2
take , for example , the striker 's latest appearance against strugglers @entity23 on sunday			1
the @entity7 youngster fights off competition from his team - mates before the match winning free - kick @entity8 nets another goal in the @entity38 as @entity7 beat @entity127 3 - 0 to reach the group stage such confidence saw the 21 - year - old come on for @entity11 with @entity7 a goal down and dismiss @entity132 , a £ 30m buy , to take charge of an inviting free - kick in the dying moments			1
the @entity137 international wanted to take it , @entity8 was having none of it			0
he scored with technique more than power , albeit via a wicked deflection from @entity144 , and completed a 2 - 1 turnaround for @entity4			0
‘ without a doubt it was one of the greatest moments for me in a @entity7 shirt , ' man of the match @entity8 said afterwards			2
@entity7 have stalled in the @entity10 , leaving a top - four finish an ambitious ask			2
for the first time , the @entity81 awaits the winner of the @entity38 and @entity8 , with @entity7 ’s @entity71 obstacle looming , can continue to raise eyebrows - if given the opportunity			1
