by @entity0 published : 20:27 est , 24 november 2013 updated : 05:17 est , 25 november 2013 ministers are to sell off almost £ 1billion in student loans to a private debt collection agency			1
the @entity4 will be told this morning that the government has agreed a deal to privatise £ 900million - worth of loans made to students who went to universities in the 1990s			2
the move will lead to fears that the private firm will be much less sensitive in chasing debts , and could hound those facing financial problems to pay up – even more than two decades after they went to university			0
the @entity4 will be told this morning that the government has agreed a deal to privatise £ 900million - worth of loans made to students who went to universities in the 1990s almost 15,000 people have signed an online petition against the plans , saying it will simply allow private companies to profit at the expense of poor former students			1
the sell - off comes just weeks after the controversial sale of @entity29			1
shares have shot up since the sale , leading to concerns they were massively undervalued			1
the controversy could be repeated with student loans because it is reported that the sale will be for a fraction of the debt ’s value			2
the e-petition on the @entity42 website says : ‘ by selling outstanding loans to the private sector , the government would lose a long - term source of revenue to the @entity48 , sacrificing it for meagre short - term gain and potentially leaving private financial companies to profit without investing back into the @entity52 economy			2
‘ coupled with proposals to remove the cap on student loan interest rates , this would saddle many @entity52 graduates with loans they would be unable to repay during their working lives			0
’ the disposal , to a debt recovery specialist , will be for a fraction of the debts ’ face value , and encompasses mortgage - style loans that are the last of their kind still in public ownership			2
the sale , which does not include @entity71 loans like the ones currently offered , comes as student groups step up their protest over the disposal of the loan portfolios			0
the @entity76 is drawing up plans to sell the entire outstanding student loan - book , which has a face value of roughly £ 40bn			1
the move will lead to fears that the private firm will be much less sensitive in chasing debts , and could hound those facing financial problems to pay up investment bankers from @entity87 and @entity88 were appointed by the @entity89 last month to oversee the sale			0
the terms and conditions for borrowers who took out mortgage - style loans will not change as a result of the sale			1
@entity96 , the chief secretary to the treasury , said during the summer that the government hoped to raise £ 10billion from the sale of corporate and financial assets such as the student loan book by 2020			0
speaking in march , when the mortgage - style student loan auction was initiated , @entity101 , the universities and science minister , said : ‘ selling the remaining mortgage - style student loans will allow us to reduce public debt and maximise the value of one of the government ’s assets			0
‘ the private sector ’s expertise makes it well - placed to collect this debt and the sale will also help the @entity116 to concentrate on providing loans to current students			1
’ the low recovery rate on the 1990s loans means the sale price is likely to be only in the tens of millions of pounds , reflecting the distressed nature of the debts , people close to the situation said on sunday			1
the mortgage - style loans were available between 1990 and 1998 , with two tranches sold in 1998 and 1999			0
repayments on them can be deferred for a year at a time if borrowers ’ income is below 85 % of the national average earnings			0
‘ the remaining loans owned by the government are mostly in deferment or in arrears , so total annual repayments are low , ’ @entity89 said in march , adding that it was likely to receive significantly less than £ 900million from a buyer .			0
