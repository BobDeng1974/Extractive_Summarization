@entity67 , which is building the watch , has upped its number of workers from 2,000 to 10,000 and is ultimately aiming for 20,000			2
the initial round of shipments will be 3 to 5 million watches			0
@entity2 anticipates a total of 24 million watches to be shipped during 2015 , @entity76 said			1
according to @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity2 's senior vice president of retail and online stores hinted at the release date when she told staff : ' we ’re going into the holidays , we ’ll go into @entity85 , and then we ’ve got a new watch launch coming in the spring			1

@entity85 falls on 19 february next year , so ms @entity149 comments push it at least beyond this date			0
despite the range of impressive features unveiled by mr @entity87 , there was something he failed to mention : battery life			0
the telling omission suggests the watch ’s battery life will be the @entity160 of the device when it eventually does go on sale			2
@entity2 is said to be unhappy with the watch 's battery life , and the long lead time before the $ 349 ( £ 216 ) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it 's released early next year			1
@entity2 's chief executive @entity87 ( pictured ) unveiled the watch at a launch event in september			1
although he did n't reveal battery life details , mr @entity87 did spend some time talking about the watch 's charging system , which combines @entity2 ’s magsafe technology with inductive charging most existing smartwatches on the market , such as @entity177 and @entity178 , tend to last up to a week on a single charge			1
the closest @entity87 came to talking about the battery life for the watch was saying that users would ‘ charge it at night			0
’ during an interview in @entity186 , @entity2 's senior vice president of operations @entity184 said : ' we want to make the best product in the world			1
' one of our competitors is on their fourth or fifth attempt , but nobody is wearing them			0

the long lead time before the $ 349 ( £ 216 ) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it 's released early next year a spokesperson for @entity2 declined to provide battery details to @entity217 and said they will be revealed closer to launch next year			1
like many of @entity2 ’s other products , the @entity20 appears to have a sealed back , which means the battery can not be replaced			2
this suggests that the entire $ 349 ( £ 216 ) device will have to be replaced , once the battery eventually deteriorates from constant charging and use			1
another concern is the launch of the health and activity - tracking apps on the @entity20 , which will rely on adequate battery life for round - the - clock monitoring			0
companies including @entity234 and @entity235 have health trackers that are designed to be worn at night too , monitoring sleep patterns through movements			0
however , if the watch has to be charged at night , vital health signs could be missed companies including @entity234 and @entity235 have health trackers that are designed to be worn at night too , monitoring sleep patterns through movements			0

’ @entity2 did , however , spend some time talking about the watch 's charging system , which combines @entity2 ’s magsafe technology with inductive charging			1
@entity2 ’s silence on battery life suggests the company is still working to improve the feature			2
the success of the device could hang on whether or not it manages to do it in time .			0
