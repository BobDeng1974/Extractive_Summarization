a leading @entity1 fanzine has attempted to stop civil war breaking out among @entity4 fans over the return of @entity6 to @entity7 on saturday by urging supporters to give a ' good , appreciative reception ' for a player they consider the greatest in the club 's recent history			1
@entity1 fans are split over how to receive @entity6 who will be part of @entity17 's squad this weekend in a clash of the @entity20 's top two			1
@entity6 scored a record 211 goals for @entity1 in 648 games between 2001 and 2014 and is viewed as a genuine club legend by supporters			2
but many of them are unhappy the 36 - year - old is playing for their biggest title rival , particularly as the impression was given he 'd go straight to @entity30 's mls as @entity31 will do when he leaves @entity32			0
@entity6 ( pictured left with former team - mate @entity33 ) is @entity1 's top scorer of all time he left the club to join @entity36 , via a season - long spell at @entity1 's @entity20 rivals @entity17 now the influential @entity1 fans ' magazine cfcuk has entered the debate			1
published in memory of @entity42 , the club 's former vice-chairman who spent millions on the club , they do n't want the embarrassment of @entity6 being jeered and abused by fans who once worshipped him			0
in a strong editorial in this month 's edition , cfcuk – who had a good relationship with @entity6 when he played for the club - outlined their position			0
' many readers and other observers have asked whether we will begin to turn our backs on him , now he is doing well at @entity1 's main @entity20 rivals			2
' like all @entity1 supporters , we would have preferred him to have worked out a deal that would have seen him stay at @entity7 but , failing that , we wish he had gone straight to @entity36 rather than to another @entity60 team , especially the @entity62 side			1
@entity1 fans supported @entity6 when he played against @entity1 at the @entity62 in september 2014 as @entity6 prepares for a return to @entity7 , a leading fanzine has asked @entity1 fans to cheer him ' that said , the majority of the regular contributors to this fanzine are of the opinion that @entity6 is still the greatest player they have seen in a @entity1 shirt and nothing – even match - winning performances for one of @entity1 's rivals – will bring about a change of mind			1
' those who say he is being disloyal to @entity1 by helping @entity17 are simply naïve			0
should he play at @entity7 , we hope that he will receive a good , appreciative reception from the home supporters before and after the match but , for the 90 minutes that the game is being played , they give their all in back the team in @entity86			2
' @entity6 was given a good reception by @entity1 's away fans when he played against them at the @entity62 and he did n't celebrate scoring @entity17 's equaliser in a 1 - 1 draw			1
@entity6 ( left ) scored 211 goals in a @entity1 shirt before moving north to @entity17 @entity93 ( left ) and @entity6 have a good relationship after two spells together at @entity1 another cfcuk contributor @entity97 called for another show of support to their former hero this weekend , saying : ' @entity6 will be welcomed back to @entity7 any time			1
he will get the same rousing reception as he did at the @entity62			0
' that was a moment that made me proud to be a @entity1 supporter – we never forget our heroes , that is what we are all about			0
' he might play in sky blue but @entity6 is @entity86 and always will be , even if he scores the winner agains us and gives @entity17 the title			0
' @entity6 refuses to celebrate after scoring a late equaliser for @entity17 against @entity1 @entity6 ( right ) puts his hand up as though apologising to @entity1 fans after his goal against his old club @entity6 's former @entity1 team - mates @entity119 and @entity120 have also appealed for @entity1 fans to applaud him back , but there is also a section of the @entity4 support who feel betrayed by their former hero and are refusing to give him a rousing reception			1
it was originally believed @entity6 would have left for @entity30 by the time this fixture arrived but @entity17 admitted they always had the player on a 12 - month agreement			2
@entity1 are currently five points ahead of @entity17 at the top of the @entity20 table			2
it is believed the club did not offer @entity6 a new contract to stay at @entity7 when his last deal expired in the summer			0
his @entity1 highlight was standing in for the suspended @entity33 when the club won their first @entity139 title against @entity140 in 2012 .			0
