the storms which have been battering @entity10 revealed the huge black rubber tyre on the shore of @entity13 , @entity14			1
a historian believes it was attached to a @entity18 bomber which crash - landed less than 100 yards away after running out of fuel as it returned from a raid on @entity23			2
a piece of history : amateur historian @entity26 with the giant tyre from a @entity18 bomber downed : the tyre was found less than 100 yards from where @entity30 , from @entity31 based at @entity33 , @entity34 , downed after it ran out of fuel on november 9 , 1940			1
incredibly , all six crew members survived incredibly , all six crew members of @entity30 , from @entity31 based at @entity33 , @entity34 , survived the crash on the night of november 9 , 1940			1
according to records , they were unable to find an aerodrome to land at so made a calculated decision to ditch the plane in the sea , rather than try to land normally in darkness			0
the aircraft broke up as it landed in the sea , and only the main fuselage was later recovered			2
however , the recent storms have created a new tourist attraction on the beach near @entity51 , with dog walkers and aviation enthusiasts flocking to see a piece of history			0
the tyre has a hole about the size of a 10p piece that may have been the result of flak damage from the time			0
iconic : together with the @entity63 , the @entity18 bomber was one of the most recognisable of the 1940s the plane ( centre ) was also used in a flypast over @entity68 on the 60th anniversary of the war 's end historian @entity26 said he was almost completely certain of the tyre 's history			1
' the tyre is almost certainly from the @entity18 bomber that came down about 50 to 100 yards away from it , ' he said			0
' the plane broke up in the sea and they dredged quite a lot of it up			0
' the tyre must have been covered up by the sand at the time and the recent storms have just exposed it			2
' it is about 6ft wide and it has a small hole in it that may have come from flak			0

@entity30 from 99 *squadron* at @entity33 , @entity34 , crashed in 1940
the fuselage was later recovered but the tyre was *embedded* in the sand
it has finally been revealed by storms in @entity13 , @entity14
