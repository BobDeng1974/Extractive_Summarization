@entity2 's aid budget may have to soar by hundreds of millions of pounds a year because of new @entity4 rules , it has emerged			1
despite the fact that the @entity2 has now met the controversial target to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas aid , changes to @entity10 accounting rules could bump up the bill even more			1
official figures released this week reveal that @entity2 met the target last year , spending £ 11.7billion on foreign aid projects			1
the @entity2 is now the second largest aid donor in the world			0
spending on foreign aid is set to increase by an extra £ 1billion over the next two years because of new @entity4 rules but new @entity4 accounting rules – to which @entity2 has signed up – are being brought in which change the way national income is measured			1
the new total includes estimates of parts of the black economy such as prostitution and drug running			0
it means that @entity29 will rise – pushing up the amount that will need to be spent on aid to meet the 0.7 per cent target			0
one aid expert said it could mean an increase of £ 500million in the aid budget in 2016 and 2017			2
the news that @entity2 ’s overseas contributions will swell even further was unpopular with @entity40 backbenchers , many of whom believe it was wrong to spend so much when the defence budget faces cuts			2
sir @entity46 , a former @entity40 defence minister , said : ‘ what is the point of this arbitrary figure of spending 0.7 per cent of gdp ? ‘ the idea that if we spend this amount all the world ’s problems will end is absurd , or that by providing that magic figure we suddenly become paragons of virtue			0
‘ if a change in the formula means the @entity2 taxpayer has to contribute yet more in overseas aid ... a lot of people will start questioning the largesse of this country			1
there are many military figures who just do n’t see the logic of putting money into aid instead of defence			0
’ the new accounting rules are being phased in and the @entity75 said they would only apply from 2016			2
@entity2 met the 0.7 per cent aid target thanks to a frantic effort that meant increasing the budget by 30 per cent in one year			2
a highly critical @entity80 report found that ministers had splurged large amounts in the final months – with few checks – just so they could say they had met the target			0
and last november an independent report slammed @entity75 for a failure to tackle corruption in developing countries			0
late last year , the change to @entity4 accountancy rules landed @entity2 with a huge £ 1.7billion increase in contributions to @entity10			1
@entity93 ( left ) has called for the foreign aid budget to be cut by up to £ 10billion millions of pounds of @entity2 aid money could be sent to war - torn @entity96 – despite warnings it will be misused by the brutal regime			1
diplomatic sources say the @entity101 is drawing up plans for a potential £ 240million aid package to help stem the tide of asylum seekers heading for the @entity4			2
the move would mean a six-fold increase in the level of @entity4 aid to the @entity111 state , with @entity2 ’s share amounting to around £ 31million			1
campaigners say @entity96 has one of the worst human rights records in the world , with thousands of political activists locked up and tortured and citizens forced to do military service into their seventies			0
the move will also raise concerns about the lack of accountability attached to the £ 1.1billion @entity2 hands to the @entity4 to disperse each year			1
more than 20 campaign groups and academics have signed an open letter calling for a halt to the aid package until @entity96 agrees to comply with a @entity132 inquiry			0
they say the @entity4 may be acting illegally by handing money to the country , which has been ruled by dictator @entity136 since 1993 .			0

@entity2 spent £ 11.7billion on overseas aid last year but that is set to increase
new accounting rules could see budget increase by £ *1bn* over two years
changes will bring @entity2 in line with other @entity4 nations who donate less
