by @entity0 and @entity1 the widow of a volunteer fire fighter who died in the blaze at a @entity7 , @entity3 fertilizer plant one year ago has opened up about how she went through her pregnancy alone			1
' people would tell me how strong i was			2
i do n’t really feel strong			0
i just had to go on because i had two kids and i was pregnant , ' @entity11 said			1
her husband @entity13 was a farmer who volunteered with fire departments in the nearby towns of @entity16 and @entity17 , and their crews were called when the scale of the fire was fully realized			1
new life : @entity11 ( left ) gave birth to @entity23 seven months after her husband @entity13 died in the blast , and she tries to keep his memory alive with their two sons @entity29 ( center right ) and @entity31 ( right ) tragic : her husband @entity32 was one of 12 volunteer fire fighters who died in the blaze at a @entity7 , @entity3 fertilizer plant on april 17 of last year ' the pregnancy is probably more of what kept me going because i had to take care of the baby , so i had to eat and i had to sleep			1
things that i did n’t want to do , i just knew i had to do because i did n’t have a choice , ' @entity11 said to @entity43			1
she was about two months pregnant at the time of the april 17 explosion , and her husband was thrilled when they found out that they were expecting			1
the couple already had two sons and thought they were bound to have another boy			0
it was only after @entity13 's death that @entity11 learned that their third child was due to be a girl			1
' when i found out , i was happy but it was very emotional			0
i knew he ’d never get to see her			0
he really wanted a girl , so it was bittersweet , ' she told the paper			0
horrific : stores of ammonium nitrate exploded in a gigantic blast that registered as a small earthquake and sprayed debris miles away ( pictured at the time of the blast ) the @entity71 has a tradition of naming their children so they have ' p ' and ' w ' as initials , and @entity11 told how one of her sons suggested the girl be named @entity23 but she went with one that she and her husband had picked out for her middle name - @entity81 - which the couple had picked as a female option for their first two children			1
bad feeling : @entity11 says that she feared that something had happened to @entity13 when he did n't respond to her text ' she has eyes like mine and a complexion like mine , but i think she has his lips and she ’s tall , ' @entity11 said			1
' i hate that he ’s not here , especially with her being a girl , to enjoy her but it was special to have another part of him			0
' @entity32 , 37 , was just one of the volunteer firefighters who raced to protect families and elderly residents who lived near the fertilizer plant that fateful night			1
stores of ammonium nitrate exploded in a gigantic blast that registered as a small earthquake and sprayed debris miles away			2
fifteen people were killed , including 12 volunteer firefighters and others responding to the fire , and more than 200 were injured			1
the blast caved in homes and schools , and destroyed water lines and roads			2
in the weeks and months after the explosion , residents and city officials talked about how to persevere — to " @entity121			1
" the signs of physical progress are obvious : gone are the dozens of wrecked homes with tongue - in - cheek ' for sale ! ' messages spray - painted on their walls , and about 70 homes are finished or in the process of construction			0
two new schools and a nursing home to replace those destroyed by the explosion will soon give displaced students and elderly residents a better sense of normalcy			0
payments from the city 's long - term recovery fund , which received about $ 3.6million in donations , have been delayed as organizers deal with unforeseen paperwork and federal regulations			0
what remains : this photo was taken on tuesday , just two days before the one year anniversary of the blast and shows how the reconstruction process is far from over the city 's go - to person for that sort of work , city secretary @entity152 , was a volunteer firefighter who died in the blast			1
@entity7 mayor @entity159 said he 's closely watching the emotional toll the blast has taken on the city 's 2,800 residents , especially victims who are still recovering			2
' a lot of them have suffered some type of post-traumatic stress of some sort , ' @entity159 said			0
' i am definitely concerned			0
we are not going to lose sight of that			0
' @entity173 ' husband , @entity174 captain @entity172 , rushed to save other first responders when he saw smoke at the plant			1
when she did n't immediately hear from him , she sensed he may have died			2
@entity11 had a similar unnerving feeling			1
' i immediately got worried because i knew @entity13 was over there , ' she told the @entity43			1
remembrance : the town has tried to ' @entity183 ' but for so many , like the @entity184 , that is a difficult task ' i felt different			0
i knew something was wrong because he always , even if he did n’t have time to talk or anything , if i sent him a text , he would just send one back , saying " ok " or " i ’m ok " just so i would n’t worry ... i could n’t even get that , so i knew it was more than just him being busy			2
' mrs @entity173 remains in their home outside @entity7 , where the fence now has a metal shield with her husband 's initials above a fireman 's hat			2
one of her sons remains a @entity206 firefighter , and another has since signed up			0
@entity172 and others say they 've chosen to push forward and not dwell on unanswered questions , such as what sparked the fire or what firefighters knew going in — or what could have been done to prevent it			2
' it 's just a choice that we 've made that we 're not going to be sad , ' she said			0
' i mean , we are sad at times , but we 're going to try to make everything a happy situation and try to get on with our lives			0

@entity11 learned that she was pregnant with her third child just weeks before her husband @entity13 was killed in a fertilizer plant blast
@entity32 was one of a dozen volunteer firefighters who perished *alongside* three others in the blaze one year ago today
she said that she had a feeling he was there when he did n't text back
their daughter was born seven months later
' the pregnancy is probably what kept me going , ' she said
