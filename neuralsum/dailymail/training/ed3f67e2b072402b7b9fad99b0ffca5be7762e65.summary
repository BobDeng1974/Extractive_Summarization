@entity1 ’s @entity0 is billed as one of the most high - tech hotels in the world - with large @entity5 , touch pad controls , a luxurious massage bed and a slick app that puts everything at guests ' fingertips			1
that title is warranted as the cutting - edge boutique hotel in @entity14 offers the perfect blend of modern comfort , privacy and gadgetry that novice tech users will be able to master in no time			1
for a small , family - owned operation , it competes with larger hotels with similar features thanks to its warm hospitality , keen attention to detail and convenient in - room technology that is designed to provide a seamless stay			1

future stays in not - so - technologically advanced hotels are ruined thanks to my one - night stay at @entity0			2
almost everything is controlled by touch pads - the floor - to - ceiling curtains , room temperature and lighting included			1
even the ‘ @entity69 ’ signal can be activated with the press of a button on a panel next to the bed			0
the button activates a signal in the hallway outside the room , so there ’s no need to get up and hang a sign on the door handle			0
@entity0 competes with larger hotels thanks to its warm hospitality , keen attention to detail and convenient in - room technology @entity84 king guestrooms offer a private outdoor patio , a large desk area , a large bathroom or a balcony overlooking @entity0 of all the things controlled by touch pads , my favourite feature was one that offers privacy when nature calls or it ’s time for a scrub			1
with the press of a button , the bathroom ’s see - through glass wall and door instantly frost over			0
a second tap of the button makes the glass transparent again			0
it was a fun feature to play with and one that i would love to have at home			0
my signature king room had a generous walk - in shower that boasts three shower heads , including a high - pressure double rainfall shower head that provided an incredible relaxing soak			2
signature king guestrooms at @entity0 include a relaxing rainfall shower and two additional high - pressure massage heads each room is supplied with an @entity38 that is pre-loaded with the hotel 's app , which allows guests to order room service or request housekeeping the marble bathroom is outfitted with heated floors and a steam - proof mirror that has a built - in tv screen synced to the 46in @entity124			1
one of the biggest selling features - especially for those looking for a great night ’s sleep - is the @entity128 of beds : a luxury , hand - made @entity132 massage bed that retails for more than £ 12,000 and is fitted with comfortable @entity134 fine bed linen			1
a remote control at the bedside switches on its massage feature - head , feet or both in unison - and adjusts the intensity of the vibration while allowing the bed to be raised or lowered to the perfect position for sleeping or watching tv			1
while the massage mode is pleasant i found the noise to be a bit too loud and distracting			0
the marquee feature in each room is a £ 12,000 @entity132 bed - the @entity128 of beds - fitted with comfortable @entity134 fine linen a touch pad provides privacy in the bathroom ; with the press of a button the see - through glass wall becomes opaque when guests are n’t playing with the remote they can pick up an @entity38 ( there ’s one in every room ) and swipe through the hotel ’s concierge app , which manages almost every detail of their stay			1
before i arrived i downloaded the app to my smartphone to get a better sense of the amenities and services offered at @entity0			0
while it 's one thing to play around with the app beforehand , one does n't fully appreciate it until they walk through the hotel ’s front door ( which is equipped with sensors and swings open automatically , of course )			0
@entity0 ’s front door is equipped with sensors and swings open automatically when guests arrive and depart almost everything in the room is controlled by touch pads , including the floor - to - ceiling curtains , temperature and lighting guests can use @entity0 's official app or call the reception desk to have a 3d blue - ray film delivered by staff on my first night i used the app to request a wake - up call and to have a 3d blu - ray film delivered to my room			1
an employee from the front desk arrived within minutes with the film in hand , plus two pairs of 3d glasses			0
the following morning i used the app to browse the breakfast menu – still in my pyjamas – and have a full @entity212 delivered to my room - without having to pick up the phone and call the reception desk			2
with the app guests can select the exact time that they want their order to arrive - a feature that is incredibly handy for those who want a hot meal or boozy drink delivered to their room when they return from a long day of shopping , touring or sitting in business meetings			2
for meetings or private functions @entity0 offers a media lounge with a 103in @entity229 and enough space for up to 14 people @entity0 's restaurant , @entity233 , offers afternoon tea with a selection of delicious finger sandwiches @entity238 daily , the restaurant features theatrical black crystal chandeliers and an open fireplace and large comfortable chairs guests can also use the digital concierge to make reservations at @entity0 ’s restaurant - bistrot on the @entity0 - submit housekeeping requests , organise health and beauty appointments , or arrange for a complimentary pot of tea to be delivered to them			1
it may seem lazy but it 's right up my alley			0
i would rather tap a few buttons on an @entity38 or mobile phone than call down to the front desk when ordering room service or requesting a wake - up call			2
of the very few negatives about my stay , it took some time to master the @entity124 ’s smart remote and my room was located next to the lift			2
i regularly heard its chimes as it stopped on the first floor			0
@entity0 was ahead of the curve with its integration of technology and comfort ( a lot of hotels are still playing catch - up ) and it has earned high praise and a handful of awards			1
bistrot on the @entity0 serves refined bistro - style dishes with distinctive international flavours in a relaxed and intimate environment guests can use the digital concierge app to make reservations at @entity233 on the @entity0 or request room service 24 hours a day the restaurant serves a variety of cocktails , while guests can choose from an a la carte menu , weekend brunch menu or breakfast menu with the app guests can select the exact time that they want their order - be it breakfast or a boozy drink - to arrive at their room while it is perfect for tech lovers , it is also ideal for a romantic night in			1
for those who do n’t want to leave the building , there ’s a fair - priced mini bar stocked with spirits and wine , or staff can deliver bottles directly to the room when an order is placed via the app or telephone			2
my room was tidy , clean and tastefully decorated with darker accents and wooden cabinets , but i was far more interested in the technology than the decor			0
when i ’m away from home i try to unplug and put my mobile phone down for more than five minutes , but the technology is what makes this hotel special and brings a new level of convenience to holidays or business trips			0
