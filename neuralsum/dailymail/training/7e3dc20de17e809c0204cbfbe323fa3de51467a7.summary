@entity2 , who was made deputy chairman of the party last month , said she was ‘ shaken beyond belief ’ at learning she had developed – at 51 – what she had always thought of as an ‘ old woman ’s disease ’			1
her surprise was compounded when doctors revealed that the likely culprit was a chronic shortage of vitamin d , caused by a lack of sunlight			2
after her accident in may , mrs @entity2 , a mother of three , spent almost four months in a wheelchair and on crutches			1
after a brief period of recuperation she managed to continue working and attend key debates in the @entity30			2
she has decided to speak out for the first time to mark @entity32 and to encourage other women to take simple steps to protect their health			1
osteoporosis , or brittle bone disease , is a hidden condition that many do n’t realise they have until it is well advanced			2
half of all women and one in five men over 50 will at some point suffer a fracture because of poor bone health			2
three million have been diagnosed with the disease , which is often the cause of the so - called ‘ dowager ’s hump ’ in the elderly			1
however an increasing number of younger men and women in their 20s and 30s are also developing osteoporosis due to poor diet or eating disorders			0
last year the @entity59 wrote a moving first - hand account of the deaths of her mother and grandmother to the disease exclusively for the @entity65 to raise awareness of the condition			0
mrs @entity2 , who won her seat of @entity69 and @entity70 at the 2010 election , vividly recalls reading the @entity73 ’s front page article , not realising that she had the disease herself			1
‘ i always thought , as many people do , of osteoporosis as an old woman ’s disease			0
‘ i just would n’t have thought it would affect a busy , fairly healthy working mum like me , ’ she said			0
mrs @entity2 , who has been married to husband @entity81 for 25 years and has three children aged 22 , 20 and 15 , was rushing to a meeting outside @entity11 when she tripped on the pavement and fell			1
when a cup of tea and couple of painkillers did n’t stop the pain she went to @entity89 where doctors found she had broken her hip			1
‘ thankfully the doctors there were very switched on and realised that something must be badly wrong for a woman of my age to suffer such a catastrophic break , simply by tripping on the pavement , ’ she said			0
soon afterwards she was diagnosed as having osteoporosis and was told her body was chronically short of vitamin d , essential for building healthy bones and absorbed into the body through sunlight			2
‘ the irony that , as a very fair skinned woman , i had been slapping factor 50 sun cream over myself for years to prevent skin cancer but had probably caused my body to develop something equally serious , was horrifying , ’ she said			0
since her diagnosis mrs @entity2 has been taking vitamin d and calcium supplements and will be seeing a consultant to discuss other options this month			1
‘ although i was terribly shocked at the time , i feel that what happened really has been a blessing as i could have gone on for years and years with my bones getting weaker and weaker			0
at least now i have the chance to do something about it			0
’ for information and advice about osteoporosis , contact the @entity125 on nos.org.uk			0
the charity also runs a helpline 0845 4500230 , open 9am - 5pm monday to friday .			0
