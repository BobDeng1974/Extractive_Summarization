a planet which really does twinkle like a diamond in the sky has been discovered by scientists - its surface is littered with the precious stones			1
the planet - called 55 cancri e - has a radius double the size of @entity9 ’s , and weighs eight times more			1
whilst @entity9 ’s surface is covered in water and granite , the new planet is thought to be covered in diamonds and graphite			1
an artist 's impression of the ' diamond planet ' twice the size of @entity9 the planet - hosting star @entity21 in the constellation of @entity23			1
the star is visible to the naked eye , although researchers say it is easier to find through binoculars			1
for the exact location , see the sky map below			0
a new study estimates that at least a third of the planet ’s mass - the equivalent of the weight of three @entity9 - could be diamond			2
this is the first time astronomers have identified a likely diamond planet around a sun - like star and unearthed its chemical make - up			0
' this is our first glimpse of a rocky world with a fundamentally different chemistry from @entity9 , ' said lead researcher @entity47			2
' the surface of this planet is likely covered in graphite and diamond rather than water and granite			1
' the diamond planet orbits at hyper speed - its year lasts just 18 hours , in contrast to @entity9 ’s 365 days			2
but with a blazingly hot temperature of about 3,900f , researchers say it will not live on			0
it one of five planets orbiting a sun - like star , 55 @entity63 , that is located 40 light years from @entity9 yet visible to the naked eye in the constellation of @entity23			1
the planet was first observed orbiting its star last year , allowing astronomers to measure its radius for the first time			0
this new information , combined with the most recent estimate of its mass , allowed @entity47 and colleagues to determine its chemical make - up			0

the star is visible to the naked eye , though better through binoculars			1
research suggests the planet has no water at all , and appears to be composed mainly of carbon ( as graphite and diamond ) , iron , silicon carbide , and , possibly , some silicates			2
' by contrast , @entity9 ’s interior is rich in oxygen , but extremely poor in carbon - less than a part in thousand by mass , ' says co-author and @entity97 geophysicist @entity95			2
the identification of a carbon - rich super-earth means that distant rocky planets can no longer be assumed to have compositions similar to that of @entity9			0
@entity103 , professor of astronomy and chair of astrophysical sciences at @entity107 , said : ' this ‘ diamond - rich super-earth ’ is likely just one example of the rich sets of discoveries that await us as we begin to explore planets around nearby stars			0
' the paper reporting the findings has been accepted for publication in the journal @entity120 .			0
