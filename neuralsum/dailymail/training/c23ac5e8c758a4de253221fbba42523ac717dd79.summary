by @entity0 a girl who clambered onto a multi-million pound sculpture at a @entity5 museum was just being ' anti-establishment ' , her fashion designer parents said today			1
art lovers were scandalised when a picture appeared on @entity9 showing a family letting their children climb all over @entity13 's $ 10million installation at @entity14			2
but today the child 's parents , @entity17 , 47 , and @entity18 , 45 , were unrepentant , calling it a ' simple faux pas ' and saying their nine - year - old daughter @entity21 had simply been ' seduced by a ladder of jewel - coloured shelving '			1
@entity17 and @entity18 with their children @entity21 , nine , @entity26 , 14 , and @entity27 , six - @entity21 's parents defended her for climbing on the sculpture by saying she had ' always been anti-establishment ' @entity29 was seen climbing on the $ 10million @entity13 installation untitled 1980 at @entity14 on sunday the couple , who founded the @entity36 clothing chain and live in @entity5 with @entity37 , her six - year - old sister @entity31 , and older brother , @entity26 , defended their children , saying they had visited galleries and museums around the world and were just interested in the sculpture , untitled 1980			1
mrs @entity18 told the @entity42 : ' their only crime was to be seduced by a ladder of jewel - coloured shelving			2
' @entity21 has always been anti-establishment but she would never hurt anybody			0
' mr @entity17 , who sold @entity36 in 2005 and now runs the @entity18 label with his wife , added : ' they have been all around the world and are extremely intelligent and educated and just happened to slide in the bottom of what looks like a row of shelves			1
' he insisted his girls were only on the sculpture for a few seconds , and said they were clever children who are obsessed by art. mr @entity17 said the incident happened while the children were on a day out with their aunt @entity60 and uncle @entity61 on sunday afternoon			0
artwork : the sculpture by the post-war artist is made of perspex , steel and aluminium and resembles a ladder a spokesman for @entity14 , pictured , said : ' there is always risk of damage when visitors touch works of art ' he said @entity75 , who photographed the children on the sculpture and then tweeted it saying ' holy crap			1

this afternoon she wrote on @entity9 : ' it 's easy to say one is anti-establishment as an excuse for bad behaviour when you have the money to do it			0
' a spokesman for @entity14 said : ' there is always risk of damage when visitors touch works of art , but the sculpture has been checked by @entity100 â€™s conservation team and no damage has been caused on this occasion			0
' @entity13 , who died in 1994 , is hailed as one of the most significant post-war @entity105 artists , and his untitled 1980 work , made out of steel , aluminium and perspex , is one of his most valuable creations			2
