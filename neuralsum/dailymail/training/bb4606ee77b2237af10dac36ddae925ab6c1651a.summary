iced chocolate treats may be a firm favourite these days , but it seems that the combination is older than many people thought			0
the earliest @entity6 recipe for chocolate ' dessert ' has been discovered after being hidden for 350 years			2
the recipe was written at a time when chocolate was very different from what we are familiar with today			1
@entity14 : the dessert is similar to a modern iced chocolate drink , according to dr @entity17 it was made by shaking a salty chocolate liquid inside a container surrounded by snow , with the resulting concoction being similar to chilled drinks sold in coffee shops today			1
dr @entity17 , from the @entity25 , discovered the dessert in a pamphlet of seven recipes for chocolate dishes written in 1668 by @entity29 , 2nd @entity30			1
the restoration chocoholic was @entity33 's patron and the great , great grandfather of @entity35 , 4th @entity30 , credited with inventing the sandwich			1
dr @entity17 said : ' i tried out the freezing method using snow - and lived to tell the tale , despite not following @entity43 's advice			1
' it was pretty good , it 's not creamy like you would expect of an ice - cream , it 's like a very solid version of one of the iced coffees you can buy from a high street coffee shop			0
' today iced cold drinks and treats are usually enjoyed on hot summer days , rather than in the depths of winter , which was virtually the only time the @entity30 could have the drinks			1
dr @entity17 said : ' freezing food required cutting - edge technology in seventeenth - century @entity6 , so these ices were seen as great luxuries			1
' there were a few reasons why the @entity30 would have been collecting the recipes			0
delicious : the dessert is not like a modern ice cream and is icy rather than creamy ' firstly they just liked it			0
secondly , there seems to be a long term interest in bringing chocolate to @entity6 commercially			0
' sandwich also sits on a committee looking at how to improve trade with newly colonised areas in @entity79 and @entity80			0
' lastly , the @entity30 was a member of the @entity82 and they were interested in freezing and ice , this was at the time when @entity87 was doing a lot of work on how to freeze things			1
' even if the technology was yet to catch up , chocolate was till a novelty item and only just ticking the nation 's taste buds in the 1600s			0
dr @entity17 explained : ' chocolate was first advertised in @entity6 around 1640 as an exotic drink made from cacao beans			0
in the 1660s , when the @entity30 collected his recipes , chocolate often came with advice about safe consumption			1
the recipe was found in a pamphlet my sir @entity29 , the 2nd @entity30 ' one physician cautioned that the ingredients in hot chocolate could cause insomnia , excess mucus , or haemorrhoids			1
people worried that iced chocolate in particular was ' unwholesome ' and could damage the stomach , heart , and lungs			0
' there were ways round this , however			0
@entity124 thought the best way to ward off the dangers of eating frozen chocolate was to ' @entity129 chocolatti of an houre after ' it			0
in other words , chocoholics are not new			0
' the discovery was made during a search of a journal kept by @entity29 , 2nd @entity30 , by @entity25 historian , dr @entity17			1
altogether seven recipes were found , including one acquired by the @entity30 from @entity139 for enhancing chocolate with extravagant ingredients including whale vomit , known as ambergris , musk and civet , a substance extracted from the glands of a civet cat			1
the recipe has a £ 200 cost written on it - a staggering amount for the time - but it is not known whether this was the price paid for the recipe or the cost of the ingredients			1
dr @entity17 said : ' @entity139 's recipe involved mixing 3lbs of cocoa nuts , oil of @entity160 , oil of aniseed , oil of cinnamon , cardamom and @entity167 pepper to make what they call a leaven cake , although it 's nothing like what we would consider a leaven cake today			0
' then to make the chocolate he says you should mix more cocoa nuts , vanilla and sugar , which could be perfumed with musk , ambergris and civet			0
' it 's unclear if @entity43 paid £ 200 for the recipe itself or just for the ingredients , but to put it in perspective if you are a housemaid in the @entity30 's house you would make £ 4 a year			2
' the thick mixture would usually be watered down before it was drunk , or it may have been mixed in a way similar to the @entity30 's own recipe			2
six of the other recipes recorded by the @entity30 were drawn from his connections on the continent , where drinking chocolate was pioneered by the @entity199			2
changes : the chocolate is very different from the sweet , milky form we eat now dr @entity204 said : ' sandwich used a book called a @entity207 on the @entity208 of chocolate by a @entity199 doctor called @entity211 , which had been translated into @entity212 , for some of the recipes			0
' the others came from one of his subordinates in @entity199 called @entity219 , who sent information from @entity221 on frozen chocolate technology , including a recipe for frozen chocolate froth			2
' dr @entity204 recreated the @entity30 's own recipe , which resembled a thicker version of the iced coffee drinks available at high street coffee shops today			2
the @entity30 's recipe read : ' prepare the chocolatti [ to make a drink ] ... and then @entity241 the vessell that hath the @entity237 in it , into a @entity232 [ i.e. a carafe ] of snow stirred together with some salt , & shaike the snow together sometyme & it will putt the @entity237 into tender @entity238 & soe eate it with spoons			1
