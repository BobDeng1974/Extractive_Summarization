by @entity0 with a hefty £ 1bn price tag , the @entity2 ’s new hi - tech headquarters certainly have n’t compromised on comfort or style			1
but just 18 months after opening , @entity7 bosses have now demanded a costly @entity10 - themed makeover of their central @entity12 offices because they claim they are ‘ not inspiring enough ’			1
just weeks after announcing the closure of youth station @entity15 , bosses are now spending tens of thousands of pounds re-vamping the sixth and seventh floors of @entity18 with a design based around the popular @entity2 soap			1
re-vamp : tens of thousands of pounds will be spent on transforming floors 6 and 7 into @entity24 the new plans , the brainchild of the @entity2 ’s director of television , @entity26 , will include an ‘ @entity29 ’ hot - desking area , with iron railings around it and a @entity33 - themed meeting room			1
the 6th floor is being given a ‘ welcome to tv ’ theme and is believed to be centred on the most famous characters from @entity2 shows			0
carpets are being torn up while ‘ street scape art ’ featuring well - known landmarks from the @entity2 soap is also being installed			1
a committee put together by @entity26 decided that the new themed areas are essential to giving the offices ‘ a unique sense of identity ’			0
@entity2 worker @entity48 , who works in arts and entertainment , has written to @entity51 , the @entity2 ’s in - house magazine , to complain about the huge cost of the makeover			2
corporation bosses have been blasted for the expenditure weeks after announcing the closure of @entity2 a hot - desking area will be in the style of @entity29 , the fictional centre of town in @entity10 she wrote : ‘ can i ask why some of the carpets have been replaced in @entity65 only 18 months after we moved into the new building ? ‘ i think many of us would rather have a modest pay rise than be dazzled by a new garish carpet as we step out of the lift			1
’ however , bosses at the @entity2 defended the move , saying the re-vamp was ‘ necessary ’ after @entity2 creatives complained that the 6th and 7th floors was ‘ not inspiring ’			2
the news comes the same week @entity78 premiered , a satire parodying the @entity7 's bosses as ditsy @entity81 , the chief adviser for @entity82 , replied : ‘ following @entity82 ’s move to @entity65 last year , there was strong feedback from staff that the sixth and seventh floors did not feel like creative spaces and lacked character			1
‘ in response , @entity26 asked for volunteers from @entity82 staff to join a committee to come up with plans - at a reasonable cost - to make the spaces more creative and vibrant			2
' the changes you are now seeing with tv branding , images and props are the ideas this volunteer group from all levels of @entity82 have devised and agreed to			0
‘ once the work is completed in the next month , the sixth floor will have a ‘ @entity108 ’ theme and the seventh floor will have the feel of an outside street scape			0
‘ the committee also made the decision to change the flooring to give these areas a unique sense of identity and the previous carpet is being re-used elsewhere in the building			0
‘ the railings around the hot - desking area on the seventh floor will be part of ‘ @entity29 ’ with the outside of the meeting room branded as the ‘ @entity33 ’			1
‘ we want to make our space feel inspiring and creative - a home for @entity82 that reflects our ambitions as the very best broadcaster and producer in the world			0
