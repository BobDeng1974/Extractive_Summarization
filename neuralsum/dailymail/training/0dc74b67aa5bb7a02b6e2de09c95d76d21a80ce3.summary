by @entity0 @entity1 could place ' flags ' on search results to show it has hidden links to embarrassing information following the @entity7 's controversial ' right to be forgotten ' ruling			1
under the plans , an alert would appear at the bottom of a page of search results telling internet users in @entity15 whether certain links had been deleted			1
it comes after the @entity7 in @entity18 ruled that people have a right to ask for ‘ inadequate , irrelevant or no longer relevant , or excessive ’ material about them to be dropped from search results			1
@entity1 is planning to put ' flags ' on search results to alert people that links to sensitive information has been removed the internet giant has since provided forms allowing people to ask that certain information about them be hidden when their name is searched online			1
but the company is planning to flag up to @entity37 the occasions when it has removed certain links once a search request has been made , @entity34 reports			2
sensitive material would not have to be removed from the internet altogether under the ruling as it would remain on websites such as @entity44			2
but information not shown in internet search results is effectively beyond the reach of web users who do not know the specific location of what they are looking for			1
earlier this month it was revealed @entity1 had received one demand every seven seconds to suppress information about people ’s pasts			2
the figures indicate that large amounts of material could disappear from public reach as a direct result of the @entity7 decision that search engines must enforce the ‘ right to be forgotten ’			1
managers at the search engine said the online form was used 12,000 times on the first day its form was available – with applications arriving at the rate of 20 a minute during its busiest periods			0
demands came from all 28 @entity76 countries , but are understood to have involved hundreds from @entity77			0
although @entity1 is based in @entity79 , judges ruled that it could be considered a @entity15 organisation because it maintains sales offices in @entity15 countries			2
internet pioneer : @entity85 founder @entity84 said that the @entity15 attempt to suppress information would not work because of the global scale of the web a high proportion of the information expected be lost to @entity15 search engine users is likely to be connected to convicted criminals trying to remove records of their past that could be seen by employers , clients or social contacts			1
over the first three days following the court judgement , those asking for records to be removed in @entity77 included a convicted user of child pornography , a politician with a chequered record in office , and a doctor with a controversial professional record			1
' there are many search engines around the world which do n’t have a presence in @entity15 and who wo n’t abide by this ruling ' @entity84 , @entity85 founder the ruling was triggered by a test case involving a @entity118 citizen who wanted @entity1 to stop providing an embarrassing link in searches for his name			1
the link provided a regional newspaper advert from 1998 , in which authorities were auctioning the man ’s house to recoup debts to the social security system			0
judges said search engines should be required on request to remove links which breached the ‘ right to be forgotten ’ – a new rule strongly supported by officials in @entity136 but one which has yet to be incorporated into @entity76 treaty law			2
the scope of the rule – against which there is no appeal – is not yet clear			0
one internet pioneer , @entity85 founder @entity84 , has already said that the @entity15 attempt to suppress information would not work because of the global scale of the web			0
he told the @entity148 ’s @entity147 show : ‘ they do n’t censor the @entity151 version			0
that is not going to happen			0
there are many search engines around the world which do n’t have a presence in @entity15 and who wo n’t abide by this ruling			0
’ @entity160 co-founder @entity159 has suggested authoritarian states around the world will see the controversial ruling as a green light to internet censorship the @entity148 , which runs an archive of news stories dating back to the 1990s , is also among organisations to receive requests that material cease to be flagged up			1
in his first interview since the decision , company co-founder @entity159 suggested authoritarian states around the world will see the changes as a green light to internet censorship			0
' it will be used by other governments that are n't as forward and progressive as @entity15 to do bad things , ' he told the @entity182			0
@entity1 has been contacted for further comment .			0
