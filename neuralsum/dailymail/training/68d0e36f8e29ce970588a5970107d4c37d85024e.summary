@entity5 , 31 , will lead the line against @entity7 after scoring three goals in his last three games , including a match - winning double at @entity12 on monday night			1
but @entity13 indicated he was ready to leave out his fellow @entity14 — only to have his hand forced by injuries to other players			0
@entity0 ( left ) admitted he was prepared to drop @entity2 during his off - form spell @entity5 scores a brace in @entity1 's last game against @entity12 - his third goal in three games @entity5 played against @entity23 on november 29 under severe pressure after a run of one goal in six games and having only 13 touches in a win at @entity30			1
but @entity31 and @entity32 were n’t fit enough to start against @entity23 and though @entity32 had recovered to face @entity34 three days later , @entity33 was missing because of a knee injury			2
@entity13 said : ‘ i am very happy for @entity5 that he is scoring goals			2
he was n’t playing very well before but he was a lucky boy because @entity31 was injured , @entity33 can play in a lot of positions and @entity32 is a young talent who has to show himself in training sessions			0
the @entity14 would have been on the bench had @entity31 been fit enough to play ‘ i have always played with two strikers , only three or four times with one striker , so maybe he was lucky			0
’ @entity13 says he will resist the temptation to rush back @entity47 ( hamstring ) and @entity49 ( hamstring ) , although both are training			0
he expects @entity52 to play some part for @entity7 today , saying of the @entity54 : ‘ it is difficult for other teams to manage him , but it is also difficult for his team - mates ! ’			1
