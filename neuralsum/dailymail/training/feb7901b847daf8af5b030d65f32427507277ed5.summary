flying off the shelves : more than a million children unwrapped a console this @entity3 games consoles flew off the shelves at a phenomenal rate before @entity3 , with shops around @entity8 shifting , on average , one machine every second			1
that remarkable figure means that more than a million children unwrapped a console on the big day itself – no doubt as their indulgent parents gazed happily on			1
but parents expecting @entity18 4s and @entity19 to provide their offspring with puzzles to solve , or colourful worlds to explore , could be in for an unpleasant – and grisly – shock			2
while the high - powered consoles themselves offer more life - like play than ever before , most parents do not realise this means the violence and depravity featured in the best - selling games will be depicted in sickeningly realistic detail			1
there are games suitable for small children , but peer pressure means many of the teenagers who provide the core audience for video games will want to play the heavily promoted 18 certificate products			2
indeed , seven out of the top ten sellers this @entity3 were either blood - soaked ‘ first - person shooters ’ ( where players look through the eyes of a gunman ) or gruesome horror titles			1
even more concerning is the fact that the new consoles are built for online gaming and ‘ voice chat ’ via headsets – which can lead to impressionable teenagers being exposed to foul language and worse , regardless of which titles they choose			1
the recent murder of 14 - year - old @entity57 was linked to a chat service that teenage killer @entity59 used to ‘ groom ’ his victim , turning him against his friends and family before killing him			1
both were dedicated players of the bloodthirsty war game @entity66 and were part of an online group of fans of the game			0
graphic : a table highlights some of the game console industry 's most violent ( and popular ) games one of the most notorious games is the @entity8 - made @entity76 ( @entity77 ) , which has been released in an ‘ enhanced ’ version			1
the game has been condemned as misogynist and sexually violent by many critics – and taken off the shelves by two leading @entity84 retail chains			0
the game contains scenes where players can have virtual sex with prostitutes then beat them up and steal their money , and a scene of torture where the player is expected to remove a gang rival ’s teeth one by one using the joy pad , which vibrates as the victim begs for mercy			0
groomed : mail on sunday report about killing of teenager @entity57 by a gamer it also includes scenes where the player smokes marijuana , and takes the dangerous hallucinogenic drug peyote			2
there is also a brief instance of necrophilia			0
yet @entity76 is one of the top - selling computer games in the world			1
@entity112 , director of anti-violence group @entity114 said : ‘ @entity77 is a violent game which allows players to be violent not just towards women but men too			0
’ however @entity77 ’s depiction of female characters is broadly one - dimensional with women portrayed in the main as prostitutes , naggers or powerless damsels in distress			0
ms @entity112 added : ‘ research published earlier this year found that hours spent playing violent video games was effectively stunting emotional growth			0
there are lots of games which are not violent and misogynistic but developers need to provide a product that will be talked about and sometimes pushing the boundaries is an easy way to do this			0
’ modern computer games can take as much money to develop as @entity141 films – and violence is a sure - fire way to recoup that investments			1
one of the newest titles , @entity146 , a first - person shooter with a science fiction theme , cost £ 320 million to make , but recouped its entire development budget on the first day of release			0
last night dr @entity151 , chief executive officer of games industry trade body @entity152 , said : ‘ games have clear age ratings and content descriptions			0
‘ in addition , all games devices , including mobiles , have parental controls to make sure age - appropriate content and games are played by younger players			2

one game console was selling every second in build up to @entity3
