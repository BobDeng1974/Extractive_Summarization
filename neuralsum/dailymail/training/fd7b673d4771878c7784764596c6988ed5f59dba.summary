and the shop in question ? hybrid , an @entity16 fashion boutique which supplies clothes to celebrities based in the south of @entity24 , which may explain why @entity2 's @entity25 and @entity27 ' @entity26 made the list ahead of more traditional sartorial icons such as the @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32			1

@entity19 saw reductions in sales after the two women wore their clothes			1
another @entity2 star , @entity59 , also has a detrimental effect on dress sales - as does @entity63 star and self - proclaimed ' man - eater ' @entity65			0

' we feel the female celebrities who wear our designs are those who are portrayed as very down - to - earth , confident and at ease with their shape			0
' @entity1 , for instance , is in the media regularly exposing her fuller figure , and girls look up to her for that			0
' she has inspired girls to embrace their curves and not to have body hang ups which stop them living their life			0
' this has in turn boomed sales of dresses worn by @entity1 in particular , as girls feel they are the designs that will help them look as good as her			0

clothes worn by @entity109 , left , and @entity51 , right , do not sell well but @entity51 was joined in the hall of shame by @entity2 @entity108 , model and tv presenter @entity109 , and @entity141 star @entity110			1
