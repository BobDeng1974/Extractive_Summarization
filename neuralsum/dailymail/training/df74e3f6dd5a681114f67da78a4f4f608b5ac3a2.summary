by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 last updated at 5:08 pm on 3rd december 2011 apology : @entity4 at @entity5 on thursday following the outcry over his comments @entity4 has caused another controversy after today criticising people who kill themselves on train lines			1
the notorious presenter said that anyone who committed suicide in this way was ' very selfish ' for traumatising train drivers and inconveniencing commuters			1
his latest outburst comes as it is revealed that his joke about executing public sector workers for going on strike was pre-arranged with television producers			1
the @entity22 has so far received 21,335 complaints about mr @entity4 's comments on wednesday evening 's edition of @entity26			1
and now he is set to trigger further outcry with his insensitive remarks about suicide victims - whom he calls ' @entity30 ' - in his newspaper column today			1
he wrote that killing oneself by jumping in front of a train ' is a very selfish way to go because the disruption it causes is immense			2
' mr @entity4 claimed that train drivers involved in these cases are ' traumatised for life ' , and complained that passengers would ' have to sit around for hours '			2
and he added that trains should not wait until all the remains of the body had been removed from tracks , saying - grotesquely - that drivers should instead ' get the train moving as soon as possible and let foxy woxy and the birds nibble away at the smaller , gooey parts that are far away and hard to find			1
' however , in his article for @entity52 mr @entity4 stressed that he had ' the deepest sympathy for anyone whose life is so mangled and messed up that they believe death 's icy embrace will be better			2
' @entity59 , chief executive of @entity60 , described the comments as ' extraordinarily tasteless ' , especially in the wake of the death of footballer @entity64			1
he told @entity65 : ' i think there will be many people who have lost loved ones to suicide and people who have contemplated suicide that will think it is in extremely bad taste			2
' this is a man who really does n't understand what he is talking about			0
' @entity79 , chief executive of the mental health charity @entity80 , said : ' we are absolutely appalled that @entity4 should accuse people who throw themselves on railway lines of being selfish			0
' sadly he is not the first person to show this lack of understanding			0
' strike storm : @entity4 at @entity5 with fellow @entity90 presenter @entity89 ( rear ) kissing a woman 's hand earlier this week mr @entity4 triggered thousands of complaints after saying public sector strikers should be ‘ executed ’ in front of their families			1
but now it has emerged producers thought it would be amusing if the @entity90 host offered an extreme view of the strike that was not meant to be taken seriously , the @entity99 said			1
the production team were aware of the contents prior to broadcast but mr @entity4 apparently took it one step further than they had expected when he said strikers should be shot in front of their families			1
in a day of extraordinary overreaction yesterday to what was clearly meant as a joke , one union official threatened to report mr @entity4 to police , while another said his comments were worthy of @entity116			1
even the prime minister , a friend of mr @entity4 , was dragged into the row , describing the remarks as ‘ silly ’ , while @entity120 said they were ‘ disgusting ’			0
by thursday evening , when mr @entity4 was finally forced to issue an apology , the @entity22 had received almost 5,000 complaints about the interview			1
yesterday morning that figure had risen to more than 20,000			0
in an interview with @entity52 , the 51 - year - old likened the incident to ' @entity135 , ' the 2008 debacle in which @entity127 and @entity128 left messages on actor @entity131 ' answering machine claiming @entity128 had slept with his granddaughter			1
the prank sparked a public outcry resulting in @entity128 's resignation and @entity127 's suspension from the corporation			0
in all the @entity22 received 38,000 complaints about @entity135 , putting it only second to a broadcast of @entity144 : the @entity145 , which garnered more than 55,000 complaints			1
' it 's like the @entity127 thing - it 's a knee - jerk reaction , ' mr @entity4 told the paper			2
' i was just making a joke about the @entity22 's need to be impartial			1
if you listen to the whole interview , you 'll see there is n't a case to answer			0
' most people who are complaining have n't seen the full interview			0
' controversial : mr @entity4 said he wanted to see strikers shot when he appeared on the one show this week awkward : presenters @entity162 and @entity164 squirmed as mr @entity4 made his comments on the live programme the row erupted after millions saw the @entity90 host asked for his views on the day ’s nationwide strikes			1
he started by saying he liked the strikers , because the industrial action had meant there was no traffic on the roads			2
but after insisting he had to be balanced as he worked for the impartial @entity22 , he launched into a satirical rant			1
thousands of public sector workers joined pickets and marches across the country on wednesday in a strike over pensions and cuts he said : ‘ frankly , i would have them shot			0
i would have them taken outside and executed in front of their families			0
’ on thursday the prime minister , whose ‘ @entity190 ’ of friends includes mr @entity4 , former @entity193 and @entity52 editor @entity194 and pr man @entity195 , was forced to disassociate himself from the comments			2
asked about them on @entity200 ’s @entity199 , mr @entity197 said it was ‘ a silly thing to say – i ’m sure he did n’t mean it ’			0
labour leader mr @entity120 said the remark was ‘ absolutely disgraceful and disgusting ’ , adding : ‘ he obviously does not understand the lives of the people who were going out on strike yesterday			0
’ @entity4 's remarks about wanting to shoot strikers are the latest in a long line of controversial comments that are likely to add to his ever - increasing list of enemies			1
in february 2009 , he famously called then prime minister @entity214 a ' one - eyed @entity216 idiot ' and in november the previous year , the @entity22 received almost 2,000 complaints when he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes			1
more recently , in october , it emerged he had taken out an injunction to prevent allegations about his private life being published			0
back in september 2005 , he had a custard pie thrown in his face by green campaigners after picking up an honorary degree at @entity227			0
also that year , he offered some ' handy hints ' to cyclists , saying : ' do not cruise through red lights			0
because if i 'm coming the other way , i will run you down , for fun			0
' in november 2004 , conservationists accused him of ruining virgin hillside during an off - road test of a @entity240 for the motoring programme			2
and in february 2004 , the @entity22 paid £ 250 compensation to @entity243 in @entity244 after mr @entity4 drove a 4x4 @entity245 pick - up truck into a 30 - year - old horse chestnut tree to test the vehicle 's strength			1
the unions exploded in fury , with @entity252 calling on the @entity22 to sack the presenter and even contacting lawyers to consider whether he could be reported to the police for inciting violence			1
@entity257 , @entity252 ’s general secretary , said : ‘ @entity26 is broadcast at a time when children are watching : they could have been scared and upset by his aggressive statements			1
‘ while he is driving round in fast cars for a living , public sector workers are busy holding our society together : they save others ’ lives on a daily basis , they care for the sick , the vulnerable , the elderly			2
‘ they wipe bottoms , noses , they help children to learn , and empty bins – they deserve all our thanks – certainly not the unbelievable level of abuse he threw at them			0
’ the union ’s health spokesman @entity280 went as far as describing the comments as ‘ almost like @entity116 ’			2
@entity283 , leader of the @entity285 union , said mr @entity4 was a ‘ man who bleeds a fortune out of the licence - payer for poncing around the world driving luxury cars ’			2
‘ @entity4 ’s incitement to violence , and the refusal of @entity197 to roundly condemn it , is grossly offensive to all public sector workers but even more so to our members on the @entity298 who were on strike on wednesday and who risk their lives in trouble spots around the world servicing the @entity306 fleet , ’ he said			0
@entity307 , of the @entity309 union , said : ‘ @entity4 ’s vile and offensive comments are insensitive in the extreme			2
‘ @entity309 works with trade unions representing employees on banana and pineapple plantations in @entity316 where activists have met exactly the fate that mr @entity4 describes			0
’ by 5pm on thursday , the presenter had issued an apology			0
when mr @entity4 was asked for his reaction before flying out of the country , he said : ‘ see what i actually said and then judge			0
' i did n’t for a moment intend these remarks to be taken seriously – as i believe is clear if they ’re seen in context			0
' if the @entity22 and i have caused any offence , i ’m quite happy to apologise for it alongside them			1
’ the @entity22 said : ‘ @entity26 is a live topical programme which often reflects the day ’s talking points			1
usually we get it right , but on this occasion we feel the item was n’t perfectly judged			0
' the @entity22 and @entity4 would like to apologise for any offence caused			1
’ last night @entity338 mp @entity337 called for a sense of perspective			0
‘ we should n’t rise to the bait on this , ’ he said			0
‘ this is politicians causing mischief			0
’ mr @entity4 ’s comments have regularly landed him in hot water			2
earlier this year , an item on @entity90 led to a complaint from the @entity352 ambassador over ‘ vulgar ’ insults about @entity352			0
mr @entity4 also called the then prime minister @entity214 a ‘ one - eyed @entity216 idiot ’ and triggered 2,000 complaints when he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes .			1
