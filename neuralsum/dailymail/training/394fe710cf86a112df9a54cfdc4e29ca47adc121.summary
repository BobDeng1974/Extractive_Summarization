@entity0 , heat maps and more from the @entity2 lay your patriotism and your disappointment to one side for a moment if you can and revel in the glory of little @entity10			1
in a @entity14 knee deep in fascinating stories and surprises , the tiny @entity12 nation have presented us with perhaps the best yet			1
ranked 28th in the world by @entity19 – that ’s a place beneath @entity21 – @entity10 added a thoroughly deserved victory over @entity23 to their 3 - 1 lesson they handed @entity27 a week ago in @entity28			1
booked : @entity29 @entity10 ( 3 - 4 - 3 ) : @entity68 7.5 ; @entity69 7.5 , @entity70 7 , @entity71 6.5 ; @entity72 7 , @entity73 7 , @entity74 7 ( @entity75 67mins 6.5 ) , @entity76 7 ; @entity42 7.5 ( @entity77 81mins 6 ) , @entity78 7.5 ( @entity79 74mins 6.5 ) , @entity80 8			1
goals : @entity42 44 referee : @entity83 ( @entity84 ) 5 @entity85 : @entity80 so , with @entity88 limping home and @entity23 and @entity27 left to scrap for @entity91 survival next week , @entity86 and his remarkable team are through to the knockout phase of a tournament they were supposed to have no hope in with a game to spare			1
they have been here before			0
twenty four years to the day they beat @entity98 in @entity23 to qualify for the last sixteen			2
that , though , does absolutely nothing to detract from this astonishing achievement			0
how humiliating for @entity88 to have to face them now next week			2
@entity101 and his players are staring at a hat - trick of defeats and on this evidence it ’s entirely possible			2
at 5.10pm on friday afternoon @entity110 time , @entity108 chairman @entity107 was declaring @entity101 ’s job safe			0
less than half an hour later @entity44 ’s @entity42 was scoring @entity10 ’s winning goal here to effectively send @entity88 home			1
@entity23 were dreadful , worse than @entity88 have been in either of their games			1
to think @entity101 had hoped he could rely on them for rescue			0
@entity10 , though , took advantage of @entity120 lethargy in splendid , energetic fashion			2
at the end , @entity86 and his staff poured on to the field , almost overwhelmed by what they had just seen			0
a deeply religious group representing a nation of just 5.5m people , this victory goes right to the heart of @entity133 national identity			0
this was pure and brilliant sporting theatre but back home it will mean more than that			0
the underdogs had to survive a little piece of injustice to dig out this victory , too			0
just before they scored their goal , they were denied a clear penalty as @entity78 – he of @entity147 - profited from @entity58 ’s slip to dash in to the area where the lumbering @entity120 brought him down			1
so close : @entity29 was sprung clear and beat the goalkeeper but his lob bounced wide spot of bother : @entity147 's @entity78 was denied what looked a blatant penalty when defender @entity58 sent him tumbling up in arms : @entity78 was infuriated by the non-award with the game still goalless astonishingly the @entity159 referee – a good thirty yards behind the action - waved play on			1
@entity133 protests were loud and prolonged and with good reason			0
many of the 40,000 crowd howled their derision , too			0
@entity86 ’s team did n’t sulk , though			0
a couple of minutes later @entity58 was all over the place again as he got stuck beneath a @entity69 cross to the far post and @entity42 headed in via the underside of the bar			0
queue something approaching hysteria on the @entity10 bench with coach pinto pointing to the heavens to indicate justice			2
at that stage it already looked a long way back for @entity23 – such were their labours – and so it proved			2
@entity23 made a change at half - time as @entity61 replaced @entity60 and the @entity187 finalists did go on to dominate possession in the early stages of the second period			1
they struggled to create clear chances , though			0
@entity29 was having one of those games when he looked like he had never played before and only a raking drive from @entity196 and a @entity62 free - kick really caused @entity68 any concern at all			1
on both occasions the @entity200 goalkeeper diverted the ball to safety			0
in truth , @entity23 never really looked like scoring and their afternoon ended with @entity29 and @entity208 arguing after the substitute had ballooned a late half chance over the bar			1
grounded : @entity62 did not inspire @entity23 as he had done against @entity88 @entity213 emotion : @entity214 was fired up during the national anthems but struggled to impact afterwards , @entity86 said : ' we have played a historic team with wonderful players			1
' our team feels proud and our country feels proud			0
' we hope we will win against @entity88 because this will be positive for our team and our country			1
' his team now have five days to prepare for what could be another historic game against @entity88			2
they will have their hearts set on a clean sweep now			0
@entity23 and @entity27 , meanwhile , will wait anxiously			1
@entity88 , for their part , now know that it never does any good to rely on a rival for a favour .			2

@entity44 flop opened scoring with header just before half - time
@entity29 had earlier fired wide when sprung clear on goal
@entity10 win means they are through to knockout rounds and @entity88 are fourth country to be *eliminated* from @entity14
@entity23 and @entity27 meet on *tuesday* and winner will advance to second round , a draw sends @entity23 through
