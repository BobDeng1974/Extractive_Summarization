former @entity1 captain @entity0 has criticised @entity3 ’s decision to leave experienced back - row forwards @entity5 and @entity6 out of his @entity8 squad — while including a player who has never played a first - team game for @entity11			1
the @entity1 head coach on tuesday defended his selection of @entity15 - born openside flanker @entity14 , one of four uncapped players from the capital club named in his 32 - man squad ahead of next month ’s opener in @entity20			1
but @entity22 columnist @entity21 fears @entity5 and @entity6 have been discriminated against because they play outside @entity1 , while the likes of 22 - year - old @entity14 , currently on trial at @entity11 , has been fast - tracked ahead of them			1
@entity1 manager @entity3 named with four uncapped @entity11 players in his @entity8 32 - man squad @entity30 , in action for @entity11 , has earned his first call - up for the @entity1 national side ‘ we seem to be promoting players who have come in from @entity15 at the expense of @entity6 and @entity5 , ’ said @entity21			1
‘ there are a number of players in the @entity1 squad who play out the country but i think it ’s very clear that your chances of playing are greatly heightened by playing for @entity11 and @entity46			1
‘ that might be the right thing to do , do n’t get me wrong			0
i just think that , if you ’re picking your best players for this @entity8 — and forget the @entity50 , because if they ’re good enough for the @entity8 , then you ’re good enough for the @entity50 — you pick your best players and i would have thought @entity5 and @entity6 in particular are two that would come in there			2
’ @entity3 admitted he had only watched video analysis of @entity14 with the @entity55 of @entity15 and seen him live in one @entity57 game with @entity58 last weekend			1
asked if that was enough evidence , he said : ‘ that is probably where we back our instincts			0
there will probably be another loose forward included within the group later but let us see what he offers			0
everything and everyone so far speaks positively for him			0
’ @entity70 flanker @entity5 ( left ) was a surprise omission from @entity3 's squad @entity3 ’s fellow @entity73 , who only moved to @entity1 in december and qualifies through his @entity76 grandparents , is included with other new boys @entity78 , @entity30 and @entity79			1
‘ my gut feeling is he gives us something we do n’t have , something a little bit different to what @entity6 ( @entity6 ) does , ’ said @entity3			2
‘ @entity14 gives us a bit more speed , more turnovers and the way we want the team to play we need speed , and we need initiative			2
we need to be able to tackle , able to change the course of games			0
’ meanwhile , @entity5 tweeted that he had not given up hope of adding to his 65 caps for @entity1			0
‘ i am clearly disappointed to miss out on selection but i ’ll keep plugging away , ’ said the former captain			0
‘ @entity98 ( @entity99 ) and the boys have the potential to do something special			0

@entity3 included four uncapped players from @entity11 in his squad
@entity14 , @entity78 , @entity30 and @entity79 have never been capped at international level
