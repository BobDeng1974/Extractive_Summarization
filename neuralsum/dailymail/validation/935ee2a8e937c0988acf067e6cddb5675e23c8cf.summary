@entity1 fraternity member @entity0 publicly apologized this afternoon for leading a racist chant aboard a bus in a leaked video that shocked the nation			1
@entity0 , who grew up in a wealthy suburb of @entity7 , @entity8 , started his contrition tour with one of his most vocal critics - state senator @entity11			1
@entity11 accepted his apology , but said it 's not enough - that he needs to offer contrition to black church leaders and students , as well			1
' some have wondered why i had n't spoken out publicly			0
the truth is i have had a mix of pain , shame , sorrow and fear over the consequences of my actions , ' said @entity0 , whose voice quivered slightly as he spoke			1
' i did not want to apologize to the press or to the whole country until i first came to apologize to those most directly impacted			0
he also claimed he did not know the words he was using were ' wrong ' addressing senator @entity11 directly , the 20 - year - old expelled @entity40 student said : ' you 're a blessing to me , my mom , and my dad			1
i ca n't than you enough for the way you 've embraced me and opened my eyes to things i had not seen before			2
' @entity0 then formally apologized for his behavior , which was captured on camera last month , resulting in the disbandment of @entity40 's chapter of the @entity56 fraternity			1
' let me start by saying that i am sorry , deeply sorry			0
i ’m so sorry for all the pain that i ’ve caused an i want you all to know that directly from me , ' @entity0 , dressed in a dark suit and red tie , said from a podium , surrounded by black leaders			1
' although i do n’t deserve it , i want to ask for your forgiveness			2
there are no excuses for my behavior			0
' the young @entity8 said he never considered himself to be a racist and added that he was ' upset and embarrassed ' that he failed to stop the infamous chant on the bus filled with his fraternity brothers			2
apology accepted : senator @entity11 ( left ) said she believes @entity0 's apology is genuine and she has forgiven him mending fences : @entity11 said she admires @entity0 for having the courage to reach out to her ' all the apologies in the world wo n’t change what i ’ve done , ' @entity0 said off a podium at an @entity83 baptist church			1
when asked by a reporter whether he was aware in the moment that the words he was chanting were racial slurs , @entity0 pleaded ignorance			1
' i knew they were wrong , but i never knew how or why they were wrong , ' he insisted			2
' the people i 've met with ... have really opened my eyes to the impact of those words			2
' the truth is what was said in that chant is disgusting ... and after meeting with these people i 've learned these words should never be repeated , ' he stated			1
@entity0 answered only a few questions from reporters but declined to say who taught him the chant or where he learned it			1
@entity0 has gone on an apology tour after he was caught singing ' there will never be a n * * * * @entity108 ' earlier this month @entity11 , @entity109 - @entity83 , said she believes @entity0 's apology is genuine and she has forgiven him			1
' i admire his courage of reaching out to me and saying : " i want to meet with you face to face and apologize to you directly , " ' @entity11 said			2
' i believe he is sincere			0
' going forward , student groups at @entity40 are considering inviting @entity0 to participate in panel discussions on race relations at the university – but the events would have to take place off - campus or online because he has been barred from stepping foot on @entity40 grounds after having been expelled			1
it comes as the high - power attorney hired by the now - disbanded @entity1 chapter of @entity108 says no other members of the fraternity will be expelled over the incident			1
thank you all for being here today			0
even though i wish with all my heart today ’s meeting was not necessary , i am deeply appreciative to the leaders that joined us			2
thank you @entity135 for inviting me here today - for you are a blessing to me and my mom and dad			2
i can never thank you enough for the way you have embraced me and opened my eyes to things i had not seen before			0
let me start by saying that i am sorry … deeply sorry			0
i am so sorry for the pain i have caused , and i want all of you to know that directly from me			0
although not deserved , i ask for your forgiveness			0
there are no excuses for my behavior			0
i never thought of myself as a racist			0
i never even considered the possibility			0
but the bottom line is that the words i said in the chant were mean , and hateful … and racist			0
i will be deeply sorry and deeply ashamed of what i have done for the rest of my life			0
some have wondered why i had n’t spoken out publicly			2
the truth is i have had a mix of pain , shame , sorrow and fear over the consequences of my actions			0
i did not want to apologize to the press or to the whole country until i first came to apologize to those most directly impacted			0
so i decided it would be best to wait until the student and community leaders i met with today were back from @entity169			2
i think the best way to express the truth about who i am and what i feel is to read to you a letter that i sent to president @entity176 a few days after the bus ride			0
the words in that letter are all heart - felt words , and i thank president @entity176 for accepting my apology			2
yesterday , i was humbled by the fact that i had a chance to meet face to face with members of the football leadership team			2
they accepted my apology and together discussed steps we can take to make sure this never happens again			0
over the past week or so , i have met with a number of pastors and leaders in the community to seek understanding of the meaning behind the words i spoke on the bus			0
meeting with a few people does not change what i did , but it has begun to change me , and my understanding of those hateful words			2
without question , my words on that bus were disgusting and these words should never be repeated under any circumstance			0
i am also upset and embarrassed that i failed to stand up as a leader and stop this chant			0
i now have a clearer understanding of what lives behind the words			0
from this point forward , i will be the leader i should have been on the bus and stand up against racism in any form			0
now , before i take a couple of your questions , let me just say this : all the apologies in the world wo n’t change what i have done			1
so i will spend the rest of my life trying to be a person who heals and brings people of all races together			0
that is what i hope and pray will come out of this			0
