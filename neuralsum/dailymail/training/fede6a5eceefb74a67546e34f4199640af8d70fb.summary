' really , i was just on my way to work and there happened to be an ambulance in front of me and i happened to be at the front of the line of cars and behind the ambulance			2
' i have made the video out to be worse than it is , and made the situation worse for myself , by saying " this is the quickest way to get to work " and it has backfired on me			1

@entity4 posted video of himself *online* following an ambulance
footage shows him claiming : ' this is the quickest way to work , lads '
but the @entity7 post backfired when campaigners *slammed* his actions
the 22 - year - old was sacked from his job as a delivery driver over the stunt
he now claims he 's been treated unfairly and is struggling to find work
