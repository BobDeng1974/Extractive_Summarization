the old adage that an elephant never forgets appears to be true , based on a touching video showing an @entity4 elephant returning to her mother after years apart			1
after a 62 - mile ( 100km ) trek through the @entity11 jungle , @entity8 , the small elephant can be seen nuzzling her mother , @entity12 , while the pair joyfully flap their ears and caress each other with their trunks in the @entity19 sanctuary , in the north of the country			1
@entity22 was sold to provide rides for tourists in @entity11 when she was three - and - a - half years old , and did n't see her mother , who also worked in the trade , for three years			1
they are very rarely separated before the calf is five years of age			0
the small elephant left the tourism trade ' because she [ @entity41 ] was too young [ and ] began to lose weight and could not carry the tourists any longer , ' according to @entity46 ' @entity45 page			1
@entity47 was recently rescued and brought to the sanctuary after a tiring 62 mile ( 100km ) trek in the hot sun that lasted four days			2
the small elephant was sold to provide rides for tourists in @entity11 when she was three - and - a - half years old , and did n't see her mother , who also worked in the trade , for three years			1
they are pictured here togeher asian elephants remember old friends and have large social networks of friends , a 2011 study found			0
researchers claimed that just like humans , some elephants are social butterflies , while other prefer to stick to a close - knit group of friends			0
past studies suggested elephants usually live in small groups centred around females and their young while adult males live independently			0
however , the study found that though males do live apart , females and their young actually have the sort of complex network of friends , relatives and acquaintances normally seen in humans			0
study author dr @entity80 from the @entity81 said : ' elephants are able to track one another over large distances by calling to each other and using their sense of smell			0
' so the ' herd ' of elephants one sees at any given time is often only a fragment of a much larger social group			0
' our work shows that they are able recognise their friends and renew these bonds even after being apart for a long time			0
' ' @entity8 was nervous and wary of people when she first arrived at the sanctuary , but she quickly learned that her new caretakers had no intention of abusing her in any way , ' the sanctuary writes			2
she was initially wary of humans but quickly adjusted to her new surroundings , @entity105 reported			0
workers learned that @entity41 's mother was working in the tourist industry nearby and its owners agreed to retire @entity12 so she could join her young at the sanctuary			1
the emotional moment the pair were reunited was captured on camera			2
it shows the elephants caressing each other with their trunks and flapping their ears â€“ seemingly in joy - after spending an uncertain half an hour together where the keepers thought they may be worried about being separated again			2
a previous study conducted at the park by @entity126 in @entity11 and @entity127 in the @entity128 , found that elephants comfort each other when they are stressed by chirping softly and stroking each other 's heads and genitals			1
these actions can be seen in the video			0
psychologist and elephant behaviour expert , @entity138 , of the @entity139 , said the elephants are communicating with touch , as well as sound and sight , because their trunks are so sensitive			1
the duo can be seen walking and eating together happily , later in the video			0
after a 62 - mile ( 100km ) trek through the @entity11 jungle , @entity8 , the small calf can be seen nuzzling her mother , @entity12 , and joyfully flapping her ears in the @entity19 sanctuary in the north of the country however , animal behaviour expert @entity154 of @entity127 , said that it 's possible the elephants do n't remember each other , but are just a compatible pair			1
' there is no doubt about elephant feelings and bonding , but we humans like to read the mother - child relation into this , ' he said			2
' it is possible the two remember each other but the video itself does not necessarily prove this			0
' whatever the case , the sanctuary says : ' now , @entity12 's owners and @entity19 are working together to rehabilitate @entity176 and @entity22 so that they can return to the wild and live free			1
' @entity47 was recently rescued and brought to the sanctuary after an exhausting 62 mile ( 100km ) trek in the hot sun that lasted four days			2
here the pair walk towards each other at the sanctuary workers learned that @entity41 's mother was working in the tourist industry nearby and its owners agreed to retire @entity12 so she could join her young at the sanctuary			1
