@entity1 defender @entity0 writes his second column for @entity3 with the 2015 @entity4 season well under way in the @entity6			1
here , the 30 - year - old from @entity8 discusses his family 's visits to @entity1 , coming up against @entity13 's @entity12 star @entity11 and the upcoming clash against fierce rivals @entity15 on monday morning at 2:30am @entity16 time			1
that was how long a group of our fans camped outside @entity21 before the game against @entity23			1
they already had tickets , but just wanted to be first into the stadium			1
sounds crazy right ? i was walking around the city with @entity30 and we stopped to have a chat			1
it ’s wicked to see supporters ' passion , and they carry that throughout the matches			1
on game day i love the national anthem at the start			1
it ’s not mine but it really gees me up			1
the fans swing their scarves and sing			1
it ’s an honour to play in front of them			1
@entity0 in action for the @entity1 with the new @entity4 season well under way in the @entity6 @entity0 ( right ) attempts to gee up his side during a match against @entity52 last week we beat @entity54 3 - 1 for our first victory of the season , which was especially pleasing as my children @entity59 and @entity60 were over visiting with my parents @entity61 and @entity63			1
nice to get up and running			1
it ’s been raining quite a bit but one day we got the paddle boards out , and the kids had a splash on the lake behind my house			1
@entity59 , who ’s nine , came into training with me every day			1
he pottered about , spoke to the lads , and kicked the ball around			2
i do n’t know about having his old man ’s talent – can we call it that ? – but he loves it			2
there is a lot of pressure on younger kids now , i do n’t want to be too pushy , let him enjoy it			2
he went training with the timbers under - 9s one day and met @entity87 , the general manager , and the owner @entity88			1
he was asking loads of questions about how much he ’d spent and how much various things cost , as kids do			2
@entity88 was lovely and had a bit of banter			2
perhaps @entity59 will pursue a career as an agent ! either that or a personal trainer			2
he spotted a dodge ball court at the local play centre so we had a game			2
after 20 minutes my thighs were burning			2
it is nothing like the film , there are trampolines and it ’s tiring bouncing from one to the next			2
@entity59 wanted to keep going			2
i tried to teach him the dodge , dip , dive , and duck routine but he was n’t having any of it			2
my kids have now left and watching them go at the airport is the hardest thing i ’ve ever had to do			2
it seems to get worse every time			2
they are coming back in july and i ’m excited already			2
@entity0 ( back , second right ) lines up for a @entity1 team photo ahead of an @entity4 match @entity1 and @entity13 walk onto the field ahead of an @entity4 match in @entity127 earlier this month @entity1 mascot @entity128 uses a chainsaw to cut a timber slab after a goal is scored @entity30 is my central defensive partner and beard brother			1
i ’ve been trying to grow mine for ages , everyone tells me to shave but i ’m keeping it to annoy people			2
when i saw @entity30 ’s , though , i just thought , ‘ he ’s ruined it ’			0
his is huge and makes me look like a nine year old boy			1
it ’s a proper beard , you could certainly hide some squirrels in there			0
@entity30 holds up a timber slab after @entity1 beat @entity23 3 - 1 earlier this month the whole family of 12 is flying out and i had @entity147 doing some jobs around the house to prepare			1
he ’s sorted the outdoor parasols and kegerator , which lets you have beer on tap			0
i ’ve been practising the table tennis ready for a comp with my brothers			0
one of them , @entity87 , is a travel freak and he ’s already bought a book on what to do			0
there are a lot of vineyards we can visit and we want to trek up @entity166 , the highest point in @entity127			1
it is technically an active volcano , though i read the chances of an eruption in the next 30 years are about three per cent , so i think we ’ll be alright			1
you can ski its slopes and canoe its rivers			0
i ’d like to stay in a log cabin on a night off			0
there is no tv and you ’re right out in the wilderness , surrounded by woods			0
hopefully it will be a good summer			0
i ’ll be wearing my @entity185 shorts when the sun shines			0
we have just designed our summer 16 range , and had more enquiries from shops			0
i give my input when i wake up			0
to organise the current range we went to a hotel in @entity194 ( during the @entity4 winter break ) and sifted through thousands of prints laid out in front of us , more or less going off our instincts			1
your eyes are popping out by the end of the meeting			0
hopefully we ’ll see the shorts out in @entity205			0
a lot of the success is down to our model @entity209			0
we picked him because we needed to stand out and project the funky hairstyles and tattoos you see around @entity214 and @entity215			0
our photographer @entity216 recommended him			0
he was very much in demand			0
he ’s a lovely fella			0
we went out for a meal and he likes to talk football and we like to talk fashion			0
after @entity54 we lost at home to @entity13 , who were inspired by @entity11			1
he kept it simple with one - twos and his presence on the pitch was clear			1
@entity11 ( front centre ) poses for a photo alongside his @entity13 team - mates ahead of the @entity1 match @entity11 ( left ) on the ball with @entity236 's @entity235 giving chase during a match last month it was frustrating not to do better but i watched him play in the @entity241 so to walk out with him and be captain on the same day was a real privilege			1
on the pendant handover i said good luck but that was about it			0
i do n’t know if he knows @entity250 , @entity251 and @entity252 is my lingo limit			0
we redeemed ourselves in the next game at @entity256 , winning 1 - 0			1
the clean sheet was hugely satisfying			0
when i first signed my professional contract with @entity259 i took the family to @entity6 and @entity256			1
we did all the shows but not @entity262 , so it was surreal to play on that grass			0
i got a couple of pictures standing on the pitcher ’s mound			0
to win there was special			0
@entity270 did n’t play because of injury but hopefully i can face him later on this campaign			0
@entity52 's @entity270 ( right ) looks to leave @entity274 's @entity273 in his wake up next on sunday night @entity6 time are @entity15 , our fiercest rivals			1
i would say local but the city is about 150 miles away			0
there will be 65,000 there and the atmosphere promises to be intense , louder than a @entity259 - @entity284 derby			1
last season i was on the bench as i had just signed and was n’t able to play			0
i sat looking at the thousands of fans , the fireworks , and the flags thinking ‘ wow ’			0
i knew i had made the right call to come to the @entity4			1
@entity1 players run out onto the field ahead of clash with rivals @entity15 in 2013 @entity15 fans show their banners and flags ahead of a match against @entity1 last year			1

@entity0 is currently playing for the @entity1 in @entity4
the 30 - year - old came up against @entity12 @entity11 , who plays for @entity13
@entity0 *welcomed* his family for a visit to the @entity6
