an @entity1 company has unveiled a dozen @entity4 inspired wines ' after our favourite characters had scaled the wall , we were left with the idea to brand and create a wine for each of our favourite houses and their heroes , ' @entity25 from @entity9 told @entity35			1
' the sigil and variant of each bottle directly reflects the personality of each house			0
the reds are all associated with the houses that are head strong and robust			2

wines include @entity21 ( left ) and @entity84 ( right ) ' this however will be dependant of how long it takes our ships to cross the narrow sea , ' @entity25 said			0
