but @entity14 stood unmoving and stone - faced , staring back silently at the judge			0
' mr. @entity14 , are you choosing not to take part in this hearing ? ' magistrate judge @entity67 asked @entity14 sternly			0
when @entity14 — wearing striped jail garb , with his wrists and legs shackled and flanked by two guards at the lockup — still offered no response , @entity67 told his public defender to ' tell your client that he stays in jail the rest of his life until this hearing takes place			2

at the 10 - minute hearing , the judge also issued a gag order , meaning investigators can no longer interview @entity14 unless they first get his permission through his attorney			2
authorities , who had provided details of the case , can also no longer discuss it publicly			0

@entity88 coroner @entity147 said three bodies remain unidentified , one was found with a silver - colored bracelet with the words ' @entity150			0
' but bodies were largely skeletonized so other markings , like identifying scars or birthmarks , were n't present			0

scene : this october 20 , 2014 file photo shows an abandoned home in @entity58 , @entity6 where police found the one of six women 's bodies house of horros : another body was found inside this separate residence , also in @entity58 , @entity6 investigators in @entity6 and @entity2 , where @entity14 also lived , have been poring over cold case files and missing person reports to determine if there are more victims			1
inquiries were also being made in @entity181			0
