@entity1 ’s noisy neighbours were at it again in the early hours of saturday morning in the @entity3 capital			2
last season @entity5 ’s side pipped @entity1 to the @entity8 title , now they have beaten them in the @entity10			2
money might buy a club the best players from the last @entity14 but @entity16 ’s motivation and organisation continues to be absolutely priceless and it was too much for @entity21 ’s confused @entity20 champions who were behind after 80 seconds and never found a way back			1
clinical : @entity16 's @entity25 makes it 1 - 0 against @entity1 in the second leg match of the @entity10 goal hero : @entity16 striker @entity25 lifts the @entity10 trophy after beating @entity1 on friday glory boys : @entity16 have started the season as they ended the last , by eclipsing their illustrious neighbours and picking up a trophy @entity16 : @entity34 ; @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 ; @entity39 , @entity40 ; @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 ( @entity44 73 ) ; @entity25 subs : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 goal : @entity25 2 @entity1 : @entity53 ; @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 ( @entity58 70 ) ; @entity59 , @entity60 ( @entity61 45 ) , @entity62 ; @entity63 ( @entity64 65 ) , @entity65 , @entity66 subs : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 with the league season due to start this weekend all is not as it should be for @entity21			1
midfielder @entity75 went to watch his brother play in @entity77 , @entity74 was left out of the squad completely and @entity61 was left on the bench not fit to start			1
with no @entity61 or @entity74 the onus was very much on @entity66 who has been @entity1 ’s best player in pre-season but before the @entity82 could have an impact a defence strangely missing the benched @entity69 was embarrassed by @entity16 ’s first attack			1
their big summer signings @entity43 and @entity25 must find the goals that @entity89 scored last season – the hope is that the @entity92 will hold the ball up and the @entity94 will feed off him but it was the other way around inside two minutes and @entity16 were in front courtesy of @entity25 ’s first goal for the club			1
@entity16 ’s incredible knack of replacing the strikers they are forced to sell has seen them go from @entity101 to @entity102 and @entity103 to @entity89			2
@entity25 has started well with a goal against the old enemy that wins a cup final			0
delight : @entity16 's @entity25 ( centre ) celebrates his second - minute strike against @entity1 at @entity111 on friday @entity1 forced their first corner and from it @entity59 sent a shot over and they were then given a brief one - man advantage by referee @entity117			1
@entity57 clashed with @entity35 and as the @entity16 full - back was waiting to come back on after having treatment , @entity63 almost equalised for @entity1 with a shot parried by @entity34			2
@entity5 was fuming at the delay in @entity35 being allowed back onto the pitch and after some figure wagging and a tap on the back of the fourth official ’s head he was sent off			0
it is hard to think of another coach in world football at the moment who has the same communion with his supporters and the dismissal only increased the volume in the @entity111			0
best of enemies : @entity16 coach @entity5 ( right ) greets his @entity1 counterpart @entity21 ( left ) before the match on the ball : @entity66 of @entity1 takes on @entity141 of @entity16 at @entity111 on friday @entity1 ’s next chance came after @entity66 was bundled over by @entity141 and from @entity48 's free - kick , @entity142 fired a shot just wide			1
@entity59 then crossed for @entity48 to head wide of @entity34 ’s far post			0
the @entity147 was everywhere for @entity1 and he fed @entity66 who shot just wide as @entity1 continue to press			0
but @entity16 are a hard team to break down once they are in front and with @entity42 threatening at the other end they almost doubled their lead			0
first he shot from distance forcing a corner and then he headed @entity41 ’s kick just wide			0
@entity61 replaced @entity60 at half time as @entity1 switched to a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 but it was @entity16 who started the brighter with @entity38 drawing a yellow card from @entity59 and @entity42 crashing a shot off the underside of the crossbar			1
the midfielder who got the all important equaliser in the first leg sent another shot whistling past @entity53 ’ post as @entity16 did far more with less possession than their rivals			0
@entity173 finally tested @entity34 but his shot was comfortably held and when @entity66 tumbled in the box spinning away from @entity38 as the referee waved away the appeals for a penalty			0
head over heels : @entity66 takes a tumble after going close with an effort during second leg of @entity10 unhappy : @entity1 forward @entity66 complains to the referee during the second leg of the @entity10 up for it : @entity16 's @entity186 , centre , tangles with @entity1 's @entity48 , left , in an aerial duel for @entity186 shot just over and @entity43 had the chance of the second half but dragged his shot wide			1
he was taken off to be replaced by @entity51 who signed this summer from @entity194 club @entity192 and got himself in trouble with his new supporters after an old allegiance to @entity1 was revealed			0
raucous nights like this one will soon clear him of any doubts he is at the wrong @entity1 club			0
@entity16 fans took a deep breath when the board for injury time showed four added minutes but it was in stoppage time that @entity59 picked up a second yellow and so @entity1 were reduced to ten men			2
@entity16 held out to win their first trophy of the season with the dismissed @entity5 celebrating in the front row of the main stand with supporters - it seems news of his team ’s decline in light of the sale of @entity89 and the return of @entity219 have been greatly exaggerated			2
threat : @entity1 's @entity48 ( right ) goes close to grabbing an equaliser against @entity16 kick it : @entity16 midfielder @entity40 ( left ) clashes with team - mate @entity35 as he attempts to control the ball committed : @entity16 's @entity25 ( left ) challenges @entity1 's @entity57 temper , temper : @entity16 coach @entity5 was sent to the stands following clash with the fourth official high jump : @entity62 of @entity1 climbs above @entity16 's @entity42 to header the ball pitch invader : a fan runs onto the pitch and grabs @entity48 after he was substituted in the @entity10 on the run : @entity61 came on as a second - half substitute but he could not stop real slipping to defeat			1

@entity25 scored the winner for @entity16 after just 80 seconds at @entity111
@entity75 went to watch his brother play in @entity77 and @entity74 was left out
@entity61 came off the bench in second - half but could not *prevent* @entity1 losing
