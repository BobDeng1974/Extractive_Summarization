@entity0 , pictured , died the night after winning a silver medal at @entity2 following his return to @entity4 the pedigree dog allegedly ‘ murdered ’ at @entity2 was probably poisoned the day after he competed in the show , the vet investigating his death said yesterday			1
@entity9 setter @entity0 collapsed and died the night after winning a silver medal in his class at the competition following his return to his co-owners ’ family home in @entity4			1
his distraught owners @entity16 and @entity17 are convinced he was fed beef laced with slow - acting toxins as he sat on the bench awaiting to perform at @entity2 as it was the only time he was left unattended			1
but their family vet dr @entity24 said @entity0 fell ill so suddenly that it is more likely he ate the toxins shortly before he died			1
speaking for the first time about the tragedy , he told the @entity28 : ‘ i doubt that it happened at @entity2			1
i think it ’s unlikely because of the long time delay			2
‘ i am surprised at everyone saying that this was the case			2
’ the dramatic new twist came as @entity2 organisers the @entity34 confirmed they are looking into a report that a second dog , an unnamed shih tzu , also died following the event			1
but they stressed they have received no details about the shih tzu , saying : ‘ we can not look into claims about which we have no direct information , which is why it essential that people come forward with any concerns			2
’ the @entity48 phoned @entity50 ’ practice at 2am on saturday morning after @entity0 fell ill soon after they had taken him for a walk in the area around their home in the village of @entity56 , near @entity57			1
dr @entity24 said : ‘ there was some suspicious content in the stomach			2
‘ i would be cautious about suspicion on where the problem was caused			2
everything about @entity2 is speculation			1
‘ it could have happened on their way back or even in the hours after they arrived back			1
‘ they told us that they came back at night and they took the dogs for a walk to do their business			0
‘ then a few moments later the problem started			0
‘ it was a very long time between the show in @entity81 and the trip over to here , where nothing wrong was seen with the dog			1
‘ we feel his death was very acute - it was something that happened quite urgently , quite quickly			0
‘ i have my doubts about the story from @entity2			1
’ an autopsy carried out by his colleague dr @entity91 discovered miniscule black pellets similar to those used by farmers apparently ‘ folded ’ into pieces of beef in his stomach			0
dr @entity24 said : ‘ there were not three different types of poison as some people have speculated - only one			0
we think it may have been a pesticide			0
‘ those kind of products are very common in agriculture and are relatively easy to get hold of			0
’ vets believe that @entity0 , pictured , was fed beef laced with black pellets before his death dr @entity24 said he had sent samples to the toxology department at the @entity114 who are expected to report their findings early next week			1
he said : ‘ it depends on the product , but i think when we have an indication of what product it was , then we can see a time scale of when things happened			0
‘ we informed the police of what we found			0
‘ they are taking it seriously and have informed the neighbourhood			0
’ dr @entity91 , who conducted the autopsy on the dog , said : ‘ the meat seemed to be beef			1
there were little black pellets in it			0
‘ they were really , really tiny and there were a lot of them			0
they looked like agricultural pellets			0
‘ they were n’t injected into the meat , they were just folded into it			0
‘ i do believe it was put in deliberately but it could have been an accident			0
’ but speaking from her family home yesterday , mrs @entity17 said : ‘ it did n’t happen in @entity4 – i am 100 per cent sure it happened in @entity81			1
‘ we are convinced it happened there			0
‘ the cctv from @entity2 is being checked by someone we know			1
‘ i am convinced it did n’t happen here as my dog was 100 per cent attended			2
’ the revelations came as @entity0 was cremated yesterday at a special centre for family pets twenty miles from the family home			1
the @entity48 brought his ashes home and plan to spread them in the coming weeks in woods near their home where he liked to walk			0
they also plan to spread some of his ashes in @entity170 , @entity171 where he was born and his @entity173 co-owner @entity172 runs a kennel			0
a further four dogs – two @entity176 , an @entity177 and a @entity178 - are also feared to have been poisoned at @entity2			1
but @entity34 secretary @entity179 said : ‘ whilst reports surrounding the welfare of dogs at @entity2 are taken with the utmost of seriousness , a number of the reports in the news about dogs becoming sick after leaving the show have been from anonymous sources , who have not reported the allegations to us or the police , and we can not look into claims about which we have no direct information			1
‘ we urge these people and anybody else who may have similar concerns to come forward and report them to the @entity34			0
’ anyone ‘ caught attempting to deliberately sabotage another competitor ’s performance , particularly if a dog ’s welfare is put at risk ’ will face severe disciplinary action and could be prosecuted under the @entity203 , she added			2
@entity209 , the show 's chief vet , said yesterday that it would be difficult to stop a poisoner if they wanted to commit a criminal act			2
and @entity215 , another of the vets at the @entity217 in @entity218 , said dogs which they had treated for gastro - intestinal conditions could have been ' the victims of skullduggery ' .			2

vets performed a post mortem on @entity2 silver medalist @entity0
the @entity9 setter died hours after he returned to @entity4 following @entity2
his owners fear the dog was poisoned while at the *renowned* dog show
