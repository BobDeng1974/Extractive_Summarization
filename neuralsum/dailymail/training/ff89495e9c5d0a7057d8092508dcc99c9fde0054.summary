if the weather is going to be as warm in @entity43 as everyone keeps saying , i ’d like to do a camping trip along the @entity2 coast			1
it would be great to pack up the car with all our essentials and drive somewhere to enjoy the seaside with the children ( @entity27 and @entity30 )			2

i was about 12 and i enjoyed cooking our own food , sleeping in a tent and toasting marshmallows on a camp fire			2

chill out time : busy mum @entity0 enjoys a cold drink at the bar in @entity32 with son @entity30 dream trip : for a two - week holiday , the @entity4 is @entity0 's choice for a top sunshine holiday when you have a two - week holiday , you can afford to go somewhere further without feeling like you lose too much time travelling			1
my top choice would either be somewhere in @entity78 or the @entity4			2
my favourite beach is @entity11 beach in @entity12			1
we went there a lot when i was younger and it has the best sand dunes			2
we never got bored of rolling down them , day after day			0

the @entity121 are so friendly and love children so it was a great place to take him			0

despite their troubles they all remained positive and did n’t take anything for granted			0
they spent the whole day dancing and singing and smiling			0
they told me about all of the good things that were going on in their lives			0
