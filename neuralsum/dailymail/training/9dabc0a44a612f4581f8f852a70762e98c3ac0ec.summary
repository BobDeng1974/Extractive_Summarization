@entity0 has revealed that @entity2 's teams have signed contracts agreeing to help competitors which get into financial trouble by supplying a car to them			1
it is a particularly pressing problem			0
@entity9 can reveal that the @entity11 team notified @entity13 's @entity12 earlier this month that it intends to go into administration			1
it follows the collapse this week of @entity18 's worst - performer @entity17			1
eleventh hour talks are underway to save it and @entity0 says another team may have to step in by supplying it with a car			0
the controversial rule is written into the teams ' contracts with @entity0 and it forces them to field a third car if the grid slips below a threshold of 20 cars			1
@entity17 have gone in to administration as the team searches for a new owner a security guard takes down a flag after the closure of @entity17 's factory in @entity39 it was thought that the teams would run the third car themselves but in fact it would be supplied to ailing rivals to stop them from going under			1
' they would supply a third car to someone else so if , for example , @entity48 disappeared , a team could do a deal with @entity48			2
@entity52 could say , '' we will give you a car , all that goes with it , and we want you to put this sponsor on it			0
you have your own sponsors but we want you to include this one as well and we want you to take this driver ''			0
the team would n't have to go under then would they ? if @entity65 decided they would give a car to @entity17 for example that could solve their problem			1
' the reason for the clause is that @entity0 's contracts with race organisers state that @entity2 ' shall use its reasonable endeavours to ensure ... that at least sixteen cars participate in the event			2
' @entity18 supremo @entity0 has revealed teams have contracts to supply ailing rivals with third cars if it slips below that @entity2 could breach its contracts and risk losing the £ 300 million in fees paid by race organisers			1
setting the threshold at 20 cars gives @entity0 a buffer and he may need it			2
@entity18 team budgets are now around £ 140 million on average and although @entity65 has one of the biggest , smaller outfits are struggling to keep up			2
on 7 october @entity92 , the company which runs @entity11 , filed a notice with the @entity12 saying that it intends to appoint an administrator			2
the team lies in ninth place with just two points and has made combined net losses of £ 140.6 million since joining @entity18 in 2010			2
@entity0 said on saturday that he expects @entity11 and @entity17 will miss next weekend 's @entity100 @entity99			1
it will put the grid at 18 cars but @entity0 added that this wo n't trigger the third car clause because the teams ' f1 contracts allow them to miss two races each year			1
' we do n't have to introduce a third car at this stage because they can miss a couple of races			0
they lose any money they would have got for those races but they do n't lose their position in the championship			0
i have no idea if @entity11 are going to make it in the long run			2
it 's better if they did n't have to go into administration			0
' @entity11 has filed a notice with the @entity12 saying that it intends to appoint an administrator @entity11 have struggled to recover from the horror crash that left @entity131 seriously injured in @entity132 it is too late to prevent that happening to @entity17			1
earlier this month bailiffs seized equipment from its factory in @entity39 and the team 's 220 staff have been locked out of the building by the administrator since thursday			0
it languishes in 11th place , one behind @entity48 which has failed to score any points this year despite having backing from sponsors owned by the world 's richest man , @entity149 tycoon @entity147			0
if a team received a rival 's car it would not need to spend money on research and development , manufacturing or buying engines			0
these are the three biggest costs for @entity2 teams , far exceeding spending on staff and drivers which would continue to be covered by the outfit which receives the third car			0
@entity167 will renew his rivalry with @entity169 at the @entity100 @entity99 , where both @entity17 and @entity11 have been granted special dispensation not to race @entity11 's latest company accounts are for 2012 and show that it spent £ 32 million on research and development which alone comes to 42 % of its total £ 76.1 million costs			1
manufacturing and engine expenses are estimated at a further £ 23 million			0
wiping out these costs would transform bankrupt outfits into profitable ones which could attract investment and ultimately stand on their own two feet			0
some teams raced with three cars in the 1970s though this was because there was freedom to do so not because the grid had hit a threshold stipulated in contracts			1
although the teams have signed up to supply third cars now , several of them , including @entity194 's @entity193 , have long opposed a similar scheme where outfits would sell customer cars to rivals			1
' we do n't believe customer cars and three car teams to be in the dna of our sport , ' says @entity204 ' deputy team principal @entity193			1
i think a more important question is why are we having those conversations and that 's because there is talk that teams are in financial difficulty at the moment			0
i think we need to be addressing the cost issues in @entity2 in order to support the teams that we currently have .			0

@entity18 teams have written deals to supply rivals in financial trouble with cars
teams ' third car can be used to ensure grid does not slip below threshold
