an angler has smashed the world record for the biggest halibut fish ever caught on rod and line			1
the enormous flat fish tipped the scales at a whopping 37 stones - heavier than a wild gorilla			2
it was caught by @entity10 who jokingly thought he had hooked into a submarine when the monster halibut took his bait			2
after taking 90 minutes reeling it towards the surface @entity16 and two friends tied a rope around the tail of the 9ft long fish and towed it back to shore where it was weighed at 513lbs after taking 90 minutes reeling it towards the surface , the 9ft long fish was too big to haul onboard his small boat in @entity27			1
so he and three friends tied a rope around its tail and towed it back to shore where it had to be hoisted on to the quayside by a crane			0
it weighed in at 513lbs , easily beating the existing record of 419lbs for an @entity39 halibut as recognised by the @entity40			1

' when he first hooked it it felt like he has caught a submarine because it was so big			0
' it took four men to bring it towards their 19ft boat and then they could only put a sling around its tail and pull it back to the harbour			0
' @entity16 was elated afterwards and celebrated with the boat skipper and their housekeeper by having a few beers			0
' before he left for the trip , he called us first to ask for a few hints about how and where to fish - i guess our advice paid off			0
' it looks like it is a world record for a halibut but we are waiting to have it confirmed			1
