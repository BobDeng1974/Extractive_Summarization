by @entity0 published : 18:13 est , 13 november 2013 updated : 18:15 est , 13 november 2013 ' qualification inflation ' : @entity2 said professions should relax the demand for qualifications from workers @entity2 yesterday attacked the demand for ‘ superfluous ’ degrees in a range of careers that act as a barrier to applicants			1
the business secretary said ‘ qualification inflation ’ was holding back people who wanted to become police officers , nurses or accountants			2
he argued it should be easier to be accepted into professions with lower qualifications such as a-levels and apprenticeships			1
talks were being held with professional associations to relax minimum requirements , he added , but it was becoming difficult to ‘ de-graduate ’ some jobs			1
the comments come at a time when the number of young people entering higher education has soared to almost 50 per cent			2
dr cable , whose department is responsible for higher education , told a conference in @entity37 on improving social mobility through education that the issue was a ‘ major problem ’			1
he said : ‘ the idea that in order to be a police officer or a nurse you have to have a degree - that ’s just qualification inflation			2
‘ there may be some qualitative improvement associated with it but arguably not			0
i think we have passed that barrier			0
it ’s very difficult to de-graduate a lot of the big professions of that kind			1
’ he added : ‘ for a whole lot of fairly standard professions - not elite professions - a degree is like a basic qualification			1
‘ we are conscious of some areas like accountancy and elsewhere where degree qualifications appear to be superfluous			0
‘ we are trying to persuade professionals associations to relax their qualifications			2
’ officially , there are no formal qualifications needed to join the police , although entry requirements differ between forces			1
but the explosion in the number of graduates means talented applicants who have not gone to university may be overlooked			0
university - leavers are also able to take advantage of fast - track schemes that allow promotion through the ranks much quicker than usual and in some cases by - passing lower ranks altogether			0
' @entity85 : the business secretary pointed out professions where degrees do not seem to be of use nurses ’ training moved into higher education from the 1990s			1
most applicants have to complete a three - year course , with around half their time studying at a university and the rest gaining experience on a ward			0
the surge in university applications began under the last @entity103 government , which set a target of half of young people studying for degrees			2
it has been continued by the @entity109 , although critics warn many end up taking worthless degrees or are unable to find suitable work at the end of their course because so many graduates are chasing jobs			1
the government is trying to promote apprenticeships and other schemes as an alternative to the traditional university route into many careers			0
@entity122 , the vice-chairman of the @entity123 , which represents rank - and - file officers , said large numbers of officers now were graduates			0
‘ there ’s a feeling that you have to get a degree in order to do anything , ’ he added			0
he also warned fast - track schemes could rob senior officers of vital experience , saying : ‘ you ’ve got to understand the grass roots in order to get the necessary grounding to go through the ranks			0
’ but dr @entity142 , general secretary of the @entity143 , said the job had ‘ traditionally created social mobility and this has continued with the introduction of an all - graduate work force ’			1
he added : ‘ last year the @entity148 into nursing education found that the increasingly technical nature of nursing and added responsibilities such as prescribing meant the move to an all - graduate profession was essential			0
‘ a degree has been a requirement for other professions such as midwifery and physiotherapy for many years with very few claims that it is unnecessary or undesirable			2

dr @entity2 pointed out degrees are needed for many ' fairly standard ' jobs
he said his department is encouraging professions to relax requirements
