' when we hear the term missing persons , most people conjure up images of @entity5 , @entity6 or @entity7 , ' says charity 40 per cent of all missing persons are black a renewed campaign to highlight hundreds of missing @entity12 - @entity12 women has been launched amid ongoing criticism that less attention is given to their cases by authorities and the media			1
according to the @entity21 , nearly 40 per cent of those who have disappeared , often in suspicious circumstances , are black			1
however critics allege that public attention mainly focuses on white women who have vanished			1
according to the @entity26 , most women disappear in the states of @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32			1
vanished : @entity33 , 23 , of @entity34 ( left ) disappeared on december 18 while @entity35 ( right ) was last seen on christmas day			2
both women 's cars were found with the engine running a total of 273,985 minorities were reported missing in the @entity41 ( out of 692,944 for all races ) as of december 2010			1
the foundation has teamed up with a tv network to make a series , find our missing , telling the stories behind the women 's disappearances			1
the non-profit organization was formed in 2008 to draw attention to cases and keep pressure on authorities when leads and information dry up			2
the @entity58 told @entity59 there are a number of reasons as to why the cases of missing black women are largely forgotten			1
firstly , the organisation points out that there is often a lack of diversity in newsrooms meaning the @entity12 - @entity12 community is not properly reflected in coverage			1
not forgotten : @entity72 , now 19 , ( left ) was abducted by her grandparents from @entity74 in 1998 while @entity75 , now 41 , ( right ) was last seen outside her @entity28 home in 1983 but few details are known about her disappearance			2
these photos have been doctored to show the ageing process another key reason is that missing persons from a lower economic status are often associated with some sort of criminal activity			1
behind the hundreds of cases are painful details sketched out by families , left wondering what has become of their loved ones			2
many women have been missing for decades			1
in two incidents at the end of last year , a chilling connection was made between two missing women - 500 miles apart - discovered in part because of the attention charities brought to their cases			1
@entity33 , 23 , of @entity34 , @entity100 , went missing on december 18 while @entity35 , 36 , vanished in @entity101 , @entity29 on christmas day 2011			1

in both cases the cars were impounded , a fact that police in both cities did not realize until several days into the investigations			2
miss @entity122 's mother @entity121 said at the time that the fact both women were @entity12 had not gone unnoticed			1
a separate non-profit group , @entity125 had also picked up on the cases			0
there were other heartbreaking cases where years have passed without any clues to where the women have gone , leaving anguished families with little hope of closure			1
