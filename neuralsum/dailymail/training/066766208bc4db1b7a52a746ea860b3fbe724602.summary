by @entity0 for @entity1 this is the hilarious moment a curious pufferfish managed to not only photobomb an unsuspecting diver - it took over his selfie - session altogether			0
underwater photographer @entity7 was busy taking pictures of himself off the @entity9 in @entity10 when the fish swam into shot and decided it wanted to be famous			1
the frightened fish managed to completely eclipse the face of mr @entity7 after inflating its body as a defence mechanism			2
caught on camera : @entity7 was taking selfies and had no idea the pufferfish had photobombed him sneaking into frame : mr @entity7 said he noticed the fish , but because it was inflated he kept a safe distance away in order not to scare it luckily , the sharp spines were a safe distance away from the @entity28 , and after realising he was n't a threat the fish deflated and swam away			1
mr @entity7 said he had noticed the fish while experimenting with his @entity33 camera , but because it was inflated ' i did n't want scare the little fish anymore than it was , so i stayed still and carried on taking photos '			1
he was unaware he 'd captured the marine animals mugshot until he exited the water and checked his camera			0
mr @entity7 said : ' it was only after i reviewed the images that i noticed it had completely blocked out my face in one of the shots , i could n't believe how perfect it was			0
' i 'm really glad the fish decided to photo bomb me , that photograph is definitely a keeper			0
