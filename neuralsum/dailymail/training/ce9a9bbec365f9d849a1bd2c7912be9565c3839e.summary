by @entity0 @entity1 has set his sights on winning @entity4 gold at @entity5 - after joking that his only complaint about @entity7 is that the @entity8 keep trying to get him drunk ! the @entity11 superstar came under fire this week after he was quoted in a national newspaper saying the @entity4 were ‘ a bit s * * * ’ and that the @entity15 in 2012 ‘ were better ’			1
however , after anchoring his country ’s 4x100m team to first place in their heat last night amid raucous backing from the @entity5 crowd , the 27 - year - old global megastar went on a major charm offensive			1
i can hear you , @entity27 : @entity1 got a great reception at @entity5 despite bad press this week appreciated : @entity1 was the star turn at @entity5 and he thanked the crowd for his reception describing @entity27 and its athletics crowds as ‘ brilliant ’ , @entity1 insisted he would n’t be leaving @entity8 without the @entity4 gold medal he needs to complete his collection			1
and , asked what he had made of @entity8 culture so far , he insisted with a grin that locals had been constantly trying to ply him with alcohol			1
‘ for me , it ’s different , ’ he said			2
‘ most people – even the caretakers – have been trying to give me beer or wine			2
but it ’s been fun and i ’ve had some good laughs			0
‘ it ’s been wonderful here			0
it felt like i was competing at the @entity15 all over again			1
i love competing in front of a crowd like that – for me it ’s just brilliant			1
loving life in @entity27 : the @entity56 champion gets a feel for the @entity5 track on friday night friday night lights : @entity1 eased through the @entity5 heats and will now see what saturday brings ‘ i always go to every country i visit with an open mind and to see what they represent and what they are all about			1
i go to enjoy it and to see the country			0
i came to @entity8 with an open mind and it ’s been fun			0
the people have been wonderful to me			0
it ’s been just great			0
‘ but i need a gold			2
that ’s very important for me			0
’ @entity1 admitted @entity27 ’s weather has been colder than he would have preferred			1
but he insisted that he never once considered pulling out of the @entity4 in the wake of this week ’s controversy			1
instead , he sought to put further distance between himself and the reported comments that caused such a stir ahead of his keenly - awaited appearance at the national stadium last night			1
‘ no , i never thought of leaving because it was a lie , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ and i was never worried ( about a bad reception from the @entity5 crowd )			1
i know my true people would know i would never say anything like that			0
all alone out in front : @entity1 saw off a late surge from @entity94 's @entity93 to claim top spot in the heat ‘ she ( the journalist ) asked me how i was and i said i had n’t done very much , that i had just been in my room			1
she asked if it had been fun and i said : “ i guess , but i have n’t really been out			0
” ‘ but she interpreted that as me saying it was ‘ a bit s * * * ’ or whatever			1
‘ i ca n’t believe she actually said that			0
first of all i would never use that word if i was going to say that			0
the people here have been so good to me so i would never say something like that			0
‘ it was rough because everyone wanted to say something to me but i did not want to say anything because last time i had a simple conversation it turned out worse for me			0
i decided i would wait till i had a chance to speak			0
' now listen carefully ... ' : @entity1 gives an interview to @entity118 after finishing the job for @entity11 in the heats ‘ but it ’s been great here , everything has been good so far			1
it ’s just the weather , it ’s really cold			0
‘ for me i love competing in team events as well as individual events and i ’m just happy to be a part of this team and to be part of these @entity4			1
it ’s great to be part of a team , feel the vibe , enjoy and have a laugh and be as one representing your country			2
‘ i ’m very happy for my team - mates			2
we did very well tonight			0
’ showman : @entity1 poses for the television cameras after he crossed the line first - business as usual !			2
