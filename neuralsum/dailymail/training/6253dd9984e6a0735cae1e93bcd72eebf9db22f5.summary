by @entity0 published : 22:37 est , 13 may 2013 updated : 14:23 est , 14 may 2013 acting @entity2 commissioner @entity1 repeatedly failed to tell @entity4 that tea party groups were being inappropriately targeted , even after he had been briefed on the matter			1
the @entity2 said on monday that @entity1 was first informed on may , 3 , 2012 , that applications for tax - exempt status by tea party groups were inappropriately singled out for extra , sometimes burdensome scrutiny			1
at least twice after the briefing , @entity1 wrote letters to members of @entity4 to explain the process of reviewing applications for tax - exempt status without revealing that tea party groups had been targeted			1
at the hearing , rep. @entity26 , @entity27 , told @entity1 that some politically active tax - exempt groups in his district had complained about being harassed			2
@entity26 did not explicitly ask if tea party groups were being targeted			1
but he did ask how applications were handled			0
@entity1 responded , ' we did group those organizations together to ensure consistency , to ensure quality			0
we continue to work those cases , ' according to a transcript on the committee 's website			0
he added , ' it is my hope that some of the noise that we heard earlier this year has abated as we continue to work through these cases			0
' informed : acting irs commissioner @entity1 was told by staff in may 2012 , that some groups ' applications for tax - exempt status were improperly selected for extra scrutiny earlier , rep. @entity53 , @entity54 , had raised concerns with the @entity2 about complaints that tea party groups were being harassed			1
@entity53 specifically mentioned tea party groups in his inquiry			1
but in a june 15 , 2012 , letter to @entity53 , @entity1 gave a generic response			0
he said that when the @entity2 saw an increase in applications from groups that were involved in political activity , the agency ' took steps to coordinate the handling of the case to ensure consistency			1
' he added that agents worked with tax law experts " to develop approaches and materials that could be helpful to the agents working the cases			0
' @entity1 did not mention that in 2011 , those materials included a list of words to watch for , such as ' tea party ' and ' patriot			1
' he also did n't disclose that in january 2012 , the criteria for additional screening was updated to include references to the @entity85 or the @entity86			0
' they repeatedly failed to disclose and be truthful about what they were doing , ' said rep. @entity90 , @entity91 , chairman of the @entity23			0
@entity93 's committee is holding a hearing on the issue friday and @entity1 is scheduled to testify			0
' we are going to need to find out how much he knew , ' @entity90 said of @entity1			0
the @entity97 announced monday that it will join a growing list of congressional committees investigating the matter			0
clampdown : @entity101 was faced with questions about the performance of his administration 's @entity2 on monday			1
he said allowing the targeting groups for their political views was ' outrageous ' the @entity2 apologized friday for what it acknowledged was ' inappropriate ' targeting of conservative political groups during the 2012 election to see whether they were violating their tax - exempt status			1
in some cases , the @entity2 acknowledged , agents inappropriately asked for lists of donors			2
the agency blamed low - level employees in a @entity120 office , saying no high - level officials were aware			2
when members of @entity4 repeatedly raised concerns with the @entity2 about complaints that tea party groups were being harassed last year , a deputy @entity2 commissioner took the lead in assuring lawmakers that the additional scrutiny was a legitimate part of the screening process			1
that deputy commissioner was @entity1 , who is now the acting head of the agency			0
@entity93 and other members of the @entity23 sent at least four inquiries to the @entity2 , starting in june 2011			2
@entity137 sen. @entity136 , the top @entity138 on the @entity97 , sent three inquiries			0
and rep. @entity140 , @entity141 , chairman of the @entity142 , sent at least one			0
none of the responses they received from the @entity2 acknowledged that conservative groups had ever been targeted , including a response to @entity136 dated sept. 11 , 2012 - four months after @entity1 had been briefed			1
under scrutiny : hundreds of small protests , like this one involving the @entity150 , have cropped up in 2013 in opposition to the president 's immigration reform package in several letters to members of @entity4 , @entity1 went into painstaking detail about how applications for tax - exempt status were screened			2
but he never mentioned that conservative groups were being targeted , even though people working under him knew as early as june 2011 that tea party groups were being targeted , according to an upcoming report by the agency 's inspector general			1
' it is almost inconceivable to imagine that top officials at the @entity2 knew conservative groups were being targeted but chose to willfully mislead the committee 's investigation into this practice , ' @entity90 said			1
' this revelation goes against the very principles of free speech and liberty upon which this country was founded , and the blatant disregard for which the agency has treated @entity4 and the @entity178 taxpayer raises serious concerns about leadership at the @entity2			2
' the @entity2 issued a statement monday saying that @entity1 had been briefed on may 3 , 2012 ' that some specific applications were improperly identified by name and sent to the ( exempt organizations ) centralized processing unit for further review			2
' that was the unit in @entity120 that handled the tea party applications			1
influence : @entity191 groups were instrumental in the tide - turning elections of 2010 , when their fervor swept new conservatives to governors ' mansions , statehouses and @entity4 @entity1 became acting commissioner in november , after commissioner @entity199 completed his five - year term			0
@entity199 had been appointed by president @entity201			0
on june 29 , 2011 , @entity202 , who heads the @entity2 division that oversees tax - exempt organizations , learned at a meeting that groups were being targeted , according to a draft of the report by the treasury inspector general for tax administration			1
at the meeting , @entity202 was told that groups with ' @entity150 , ' ' @entity212 ' or ' @entity213 ' in their names were being flagged for additional and often burdensome scrutiny , the report says			2
@entity202 instructed agents to change the criteria for flagging groups ' immediately			0
' however , when @entity202 responded to inquiries from the @entity142 , she did n't mention the fact that tea party groups had ever been targeted			1
her responses included 45 - page letters in may 2012 to rep. @entity140 , @entity141 , who chairs the committee , and rep. @entity226 , @entity227 , who chairs a subcommittee			0
@entity202 also met twice with staff from the @entity23 oversight subcommittee to discuss the issue , in march and in may 2012 , according to a timeline constructed by committee staff			0
she did n't mention at either meeting that conservative groups had been targeted , according to the timeline			1
' knowing what we know now , the @entity2 was at best being far from forth coming , or at worst , being deliberately dishonest with @entity4 , ' @entity136 said monday			2
on monday , president @entity101 said he first learned about the issue from news reports on friday			0
@entity241 spokesman @entity240 said the @entity241 counsel 's office was alerted the week of april 22 that the inspector general was finishing a report concerning the @entity2 office in @entity120			1
but , he said , the counsel 's office did not get the report and the president did not learn the focus until friday			0
' if , in fact , @entity2 personnel engaged in the kind of practices that had been reported on and were intentionally targeting conservative groups , then that 's outrageous and there 's no place for it , ' @entity101 said monday at a press conference			1
" and they have to be held fully accountable , because the @entity2 as an independent agency requires absolute integrity , and people have to have confidence that they 're applying it in a non-partisan way , applying the laws in a non-partisan way .			2

@entity2 targeted conservative groups for closer scrutiny
field office personnel singled out ' tea party ' groups and those critical of government
