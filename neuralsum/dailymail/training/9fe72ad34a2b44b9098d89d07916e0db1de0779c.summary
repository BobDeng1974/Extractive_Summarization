by @entity0 @entity1 : 12:11 est , 30 december 2013 @entity2 : 15:07 est , 30 december 2013 you 've heard of the selfie , the belfie and perhaps even the healthie			1
but now those in the agricultural world have jumped on the self - portrait craze - snapping themselves with their livestock in so - called felfies			1
but rather than embracing the opportunity to become the next @entity15 or @entity16 , many of the animals look highly unimpressed at being dragged into the portraits			2
winning pose : @entity22 from @entity23 , @entity21 won the ' @entity24 on the @entity26 ' competition with this hilarious image reluctant : @entity29 's sheep dog looks less than impressed to be part of the so - called ' felfie ' startled : @entity32 from @entity33 , @entity34 with her calf @entity36 one in the series shows a rather startled white calf - called @entity36 - posing with its young owner @entity32 from @entity33 , @entity34			1
another , @entity39 from @entity40 , looks particularly happy his cows are enjoying their dinner in the background of the shot			0
meanwhile , one man obviously has n't told his goat which way to look - as the animal stares off into the distance rather than down the lens			2
@entity52 from @entity53 captioned the amusing picture ' two @entity55 '			0
pouting pros : @entity57 from @entity58 shows off her best pose while a cow looks awkward behind bearded friends : @entity52 from @entity53 poses with his goat - who has equally impressive facial hair @entity29 - who called her image ' @entity65 must not blink ' - appears to be almost strangling her sheep dog in her felfie			1
either that or the animal has a lot of posing practise to catch up on ... @entity57 from @entity58 can be seen pulling her very best pout , while a white cow stands rather awkwardly in the background			0
not all the animals are uncomfortable in front of the camera , however			2
in one of the images posted by @entity82 and @entity83 from @entity84 , several cows can be seen desperately reaching to get their heads into the shot of their two owners			2
happy diners : @entity39 from @entity40 with his feeding cattle behind him some animals like the attention ! @entity82 and @entity83 from @entity93 with their happy - to - pose cows all of the images were submitted to the @entity99 @entity98 's @entity97 on the @entity26 ' competition			1
a panel of judges selected the ten best images to be entered into the final and , as well as the prestigious title , the winner was awarded a hamper			1

his image gained 2,000 likes on @entity115			0
posting the image , his daughter @entity116 said : ' @entity118 was helping my younger sister with her agricultural science project when he took the picture with his salers in the background			0
' just chillin ' : @entity125 from @entity126 poses with his calf ' @entity118 buys the @entity128 religiously every week and it would be amazing if you could publish his picture			0
i know he would be over the moon to see himself in the @entity128			0
' the competition has caused a storm on the internet			0
a @entity115 group for the images attracted 20,000 likes and several @entity140 sites have picked up on the fun pictures			1
looking sharp : @entity142 looks into the camera while posing with a fork			0
