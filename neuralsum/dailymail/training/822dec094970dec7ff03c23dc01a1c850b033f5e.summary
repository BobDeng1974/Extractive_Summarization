’ mrs @entity18 was so close to her niece @entity49 that the women were , she said , ‘ more like sisters			0
’ revealing her own profound pain in the aftermath of @entity49 and @entity55 ’s killings she said : ‘ i can hardly breathe most of the time			2
’ a victim in every sense of the word : @entity12 and her father , @entity60 , as she is interviewed by the @entity42 's @entity61			2
investigators are adamant that @entity12 is a victim in every way @entity64 in hand , kidnapping victim @entity12 touches a family picture as she attends a memorial service for her mother @entity68 and brother @entity55 she and several other relatives admitted to being deeply troubled by @entity12 ’s apparent lack of grief and string of outlandish , often sexually precocious , postings on social media , according to @entity43			1
on the day of her mother and brother ’s funeral she tweeted pictures of herself and a friend , fingers posed like guns , with the hastag ‘ true - thugs ’			2

a family at odds with itself : her father has asked for privacy to allow @entity12 to process the trauma of her ordeal but just last week his daughter was tweeting about family difficulties			1
speaking to @entity122 , 29 , said : ‘ it is very clear from the family members i ’ve spoken with that this is not a family united in their shared grief at all			0
it ’s sad but it ’s a family very much at odds with itself			0
’ only last week @entity12 tweeted : ‘ my family still ca n’t get along			2
wtf ? ! ’ according to mrs @entity18 there were often tensions between @entity49 ’s side of the family and that of @entity12 ’s father , @entity60			2
but in a poignant admission she revealed that @entity49 , who was estranged from her husband , at the time of her death , had harbored hopes of a reconciliation and of ‘ having her family back together again			0
’ instead all hopes ended in a scene of utter devastation			0
in the weeks before her brutal murder @entity68 , pictured here with son @entity55 , @entity12 and estranged husband , @entity60 , had harbored hopes of reconciling and of having her family back together in her book @entity155 examines @entity12 ’s own account of the events that lead up to that day and its aftermath and the book points to what miss @entity43 considers to be a myriad of inconsistencies and unanswered questions by which some of @entity12 ’s own relatives admit to being troubled			1
the burned bodies of @entity68 , 44 , @entity55 , 8 , and the family dog were found by fire - fighters in the charred remains of family friend @entity23 ’s burned out home in @entity171 , @entity172 on 4 august			1
in the weeks before her murder @entity49 habored hopes of ' having her family back together again			0
' @entity49 ’s mouth and neck was wrapped tightly with duct tape and her ankles bound with plastic cable			0
she had been viciously bludgeoned to death			0
investigators were not able to determine @entity55 ’s cause of death as his body was almost completely consumed by fire			0
but what little remained suggested extreme suffering and violence			0
the grim discoveries marked the beginning of a massive @entity192 manhunt as it quickly transpired that @entity23 , believed to have time devices to ignite at his home , had abducted @entity12			1
seven days later @entity23 and @entity12 were traced to a riverside in a stretch of @entity198 wilderness called no return when four horseback riders who had encountered them on the trail returned and raised the alarm			1
the world in her hands : @entity23 took this picture of @entity12 on one of their trips			1

@entity23 was @entity12 ’s father , @entity60 ’s , best friend and had known the teen all her life			1
according to @entity12 in the weeks before her abduction , @entity23 had admitted to having a ‘ crush ’ on her			1
hitting back : many of @entity12 's online posts have appeared to speak directly to her many critics and those who have questioned her the public instinct was to embrace @entity12 as a teenager who had survived an unimaginable trauma only to be told that the mother and brother she thought were waiting for her , were dead			1

' but many have struggled to square the teenager ’s online persona and postings with this tag			0

in addition to this officers executing a search warrant at @entity23 ’s home found letters written from the teenager to @entity23 in which she shared grievances about her mother with whom she was not getting along			2
the moving leg - brace : @entity12 initially tried to claim that these pictures were taken on different days before ultimately explaining the switching brace by saying the left leg was injured in @entity198 , the right one was the result of an old sports injury true thugs : many were surprised by @entity12 's decision to post this image of her posing with a friend on the day of her brother and mother 's funerals it was revealed that the pair took trips together			1

she has said she was unconscious from that moment until waking in @entity198 and has no recollection of even being put in his car			2

the author also focusses on how @entity12 has claimed that she hurt her left knee during days of gruelling hiking through inhospitable terrain , during which she carried two 50lbs backpacks for @entity23 and tweeted pictures showing her heavily strapped leg			1
pictures taken later the same day show the leg brace on her right leg			2
when online commentators picked up on the strange switch @entity12 initially claimed the pictures were taken on different days			0
when it emerged that they were taken on the same day she retorted that one knee had been injured in @entity198 and the other had arthritis due to an old sporting injury			1
miss @entity43 said : ‘ there are so many unanswered questions in this case that it ’s my sincere hope it is reopened			2
what happened was so shocking and what ’s come after it is just very sad			0

‘ @entity18 is one of them			0
