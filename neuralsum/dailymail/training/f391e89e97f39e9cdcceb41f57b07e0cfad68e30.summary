@entity1 's joint chairman @entity0 revealed three good reasons why he hopes his club gets paired against @entity4 in monday night 's @entity6 draw			1
the @entity8 club pulled off one of the biggest upsets of all time when coming back from two goals down against @entity12 at @entity13 on saturday to book their place in the fifth round with a remarkable 4 - 2 win			2
two years after becoming the first club from the basement division to reach @entity19 in a major cup tournament - @entity1 lost to @entity20 in the @entity23 final - @entity22 's side are at it again and @entity0 said he was still trying to make sense of it all			1
@entity1 co-chairman @entity0 is dreaming of a fifth round @entity6 tie against @entity4 @entity1 's players celebrate in front of their travelling fans after the full - time whistle at @entity13 @entity0 , whose wife @entity32 has been winning her own battle against bowel cancer , said : ' i want @entity4 for my wife , she 's a big @entity4 fan , ( co-chairman ) @entity37 ( @entity38 ) wants them for the money and @entity22 wants them just from the playing point of view			1
' @entity1 beat @entity44 side @entity43 in a third - round replay and @entity0 said the club 's latest giant - killing run was worth around £ 700,000 in financial terms			1
@entity1 upset arch - rivals @entity49 in the @entity23 earlier in the season and the two results have helped repay the club 's £ 1million deficit in its overall playing budget			1
@entity54 ( right ) rifled in a stunning strike for @entity1 against @entity12 to give the visitors some hope at 2 - 1 @entity12 's players are left dejected after @entity1 staged a stunning comeback on saturday @entity60 beats the @entity12 defence and slots home past @entity63 to make it 4 - 2 to @entity1 ' @entity22 pushes me and @entity37 very hard , ' @entity0 said			1
' we 've overspent nearly every season with him and have taken a risk - and he 's repaid it to be honest			0
' this year we gave him a million pounds more than we could afford ( on playing budget ) , but he 's repaid it			0
' @entity37 and i are n't stupid , we know we have n't got that kind of money to put in			0
' we were hoping @entity4 would sell @entity73 and that the sell - on clause would help wipe out our deficit , but that 's not happened yet			1
' but @entity22 got us @entity49 in the @entity23 and we beat them , so we made in - roads with that , and now @entity12			2
@entity22 has repaid the club 's money given to his for transfers , according to co-chairman lawn @entity84 co-chairman lawn would now like a tie against @entity4 in the fifth round of the @entity6 @entity87 still has plenty to ponder though , as @entity4 are set for a replay against @entity90 ' this current @entity6 run is worth £ 700,000 to us and so the two together have wiped out the deficit			1
' so @entity22 can keep all his players now and look forward to building on the success we 've had to make us even stronger			2
' @entity0 ordered champagne to be sent to the dressing room at @entity13 and joked he was now waiting anxiously for the bill			2
' has it all sunk in ? , ' he added			0
' well i still ca n't think of an upset in the @entity6 that 's bigger than this			2
' two - nil down against the team who will become @entity107 champions , among the favourites for the @entity109 ? ' to come back and score four goals ? let 's face it , it 's not as if any of those goals were scuffed or bouncing in off our a * * * *			0
' when you consider how much the game has moved on , i think this is the biggest upset			0
' in @entity123 's day some of those @entity122 players were probably having a smoke at half - time			0
it 's a different game now			0
' @entity12 's second team cost them £ 98million against our 's , which cost £ 7,500 and never mind the wages			0
