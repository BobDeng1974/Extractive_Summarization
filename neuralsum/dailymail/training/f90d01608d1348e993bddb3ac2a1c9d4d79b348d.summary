ms @entity0 told the today show on monday that her access to ' wonderful lawyers ' helped her win the case - along with the fact she was innocent			1
ms @entity0 said that she did n't think her family name was why she was acquitted but acknowledged that having substantial financial means to hire the best lawyers played a part			1
she said ' they [ the jury ] found me innocent because i was innocent ' but also thanked her ' wonderful lawyers ' along with her family , friends and @entity37			1
@entity0 , a human rights activist , described the trial as a ' scary process '			2
she said that she beat the misdemeanor charge because she had the means to fight the case in court which few people do and instead take a plea which can have a ' devastating impact on lives '			1

she was found slumped at the steering wheel			1
@entity0 said she took the sleeping pill by mistake instead of her thyroid medication			1
she testified that the drug overpowered her and she does n't remember the crash			0
the biggest question in the case was not whether she had taken the sleeping pill by mistake since both the prosecution and the defense agreed on that point			1

' and while @entity0 took the pill by mistake , ' she is responsible for the chain of events that happened after that , ' @entity149 said			1
she insisted zolpidem works gradually , saying @entity0 's testimony ' belies the science of this drug			2
' mocking the title of one of @entity0 's own books , @entity149 urged the jury to ' speak truth to power			2
' but defense attorney @entity165 said there was no evidence - and it made no sense to believe - that @entity0 was aware , while driving , that she 'd taken the pill			1
' accidents are not crimes , ' @entity165 said			0
