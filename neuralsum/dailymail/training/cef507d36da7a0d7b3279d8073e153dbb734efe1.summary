the skit , first made public by @entity47 , involved a blackfaced @entity2 fighting a man acting as @entity45 from the ‘ @entity49 , ’ @entity45 won in the end after a crushing uppercut caused the stunt double to backflip unconscious onto the mat. let 's get ready to rumble ! : @entity2 ( right ) squared off as mr @entity55 against another church staffer playing the part of @entity45 , from the ' @entity49 ' sparring : the fight lasted three rounds during which the two combatants traded jabs until a stunt double tagged in for @entity2 ‘ @entity45 ’ was hoisted into the arm raising his arms in triumph as the churchgoers cheered him on , he was then awarded a championship belt and cheered out of the room			1

‘ that guy is just a young assistant , he is not even a pastor … he ’s just an assistant			2
