what do you get if you cross a blustery day with a lightweight frock ? answer : the @entity3 giving a passing impression of @entity5 in @entity6			2
@entity3 ’s uplifting moment was part of an all - round wizard experience as she visited the set of the @entity12 films yesterday			1
then she , and her ever growing bump , successfully took on husband @entity39 in a ‘ wand duel ’			2
the couple , accompanied by @entity42 , were on a visit to the new @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity17			1
@entity3 and @entity39 were invited to take a wand each before being shown a few ‘ spell techniques ’ and being invited to duel			1
earlier the party , who were accompanied by 500 guests and children associated with the charities they support , had visited another part of the studios where they were shown props from @entity59 film @entity60			1
@entity39 and @entity42 were clearly taken with a camouflaged @entity61 known as the @entity61			1
@entity39 turned to his brother and whispered : ' we should borrow that for the weekend			2
' what every wizard needs : the royals could n't contain their glee when they were presented with their wands do n't turn me into a frog ! the princes joke about with their wands on @entity74 watch out @entity75 ! @entity3 casts a spell @entity77 and the giant : @entity3 views the costume for the @entity12 character @entity80 @entity21 's big brother ? prince @entity42 visits the set of the @entity83 home - who he would fit right in with thanks to his red hair @entity88 allowed : @entity39 , @entity3 and @entity42 enter the @entity12 set inside @entity27 : the royals explore the @entity91 where numerous dramatic scenes from @entity12 were filmed he then climbed inside and turned on the engine , revving it to within an inch of its life			1
the @entity15 joked , ' where 's the start button ? ' , adding ' it 's awesome , absolutely incredible ' while his younger brother put his fingers beside his head for @entity59 's ears and said ' you need the ears '			1
when @entity39 finally emerged from the @entity61 after a long while he said , ' i 'm a very happy man ' but when he spotted his wife the royal apologised saying , ' sorry , sorry '			1
clearly a fan , the future king then could n't resist climbing on board the @entity113 and posing for the cameras as @entity42 looked on enviously			2
both brothers own their own superbikes - but clearly nothing on this level			0
where 's the start button ? prince @entity39 asked as he was delighted to sit on the ' @entity113 ' from the film @entity60 blue steel : @entity39 looks as if he could be contemplating life as the caped crusader film fans : the princes marveled at @entity128 suit from the @entity59 films can we have one ? the @entity132 admire the ' @entity61 ' , a vehicle used in the @entity59 films under @entity59 's bonnet : the brothers are excited to see what drives the powerful @entity61 @entity137 's finest : the royal couple see the uniforms of the fictional city 's police force up close step aside @entity142 : prince @entity39 joked he could take on the role if the actor , right , wants to retire as he got on board the @entity113 the three royals also spent time examining @entity59 's heavy rubber armour			1
' is this really what the actor wore , how heavy is it ? ' @entity39 asked			2
he was astonished to discover it took 25 minutes for actor @entity142 to put on			0
the royals headed over to a ' green screen ' where draftsman @entity154 was seated on another model of the @entity157 motorbike sited on top of a ' six axis motion base			0
' it was originally built for the broomstick flying in the @entity12 movies			2
@entity163 special effects supervisor on the movies , said : ' we 've had everyone on it from @entity12 to @entity75 '			2
there , @entity39 took to the controls of the simulator making the @entity157 move up and around as if it was flying			2
@entity39 said ' i wo n't throw him off			0
' turning to mr @entity154 he said ' how much so you trust me ? ' wizard day out : the pregnant duchess of @entity175 arrived at the @entity12 film studios in a dress from @entity32 optical illusion : the royal bump was n't as evident today as it was earlier this week when the @entity15 arrived in the spotty dress with her bag across her stomach ... ... until she turned to the side when her six - month bump became more obvious peekaboo : @entity3 's bump is more pronounced in this front on shot as she arrives at the studios with her husband @entity39 and brother - in - law @entity42 keep it secret ! prince @entity39 joked that his brother @entity42 does n't realise @entity12 is n't real greetings : prince @entity39 puts a protective arm on his wife 's back as they meet people at the @entity17 studios summery choice : @entity3 teamed her @entity204 dress with a jacket by designer @entity206 but had to hold the floaty fabric down , right , when the wind blew @entity209 : the breeze also played havoc with the @entity15 ' hair as she frequently had to put her locks back into place family day out : the parents - to - be brought children and adults associated with their charities along for the tour royal welcome : @entity221 greets the @entity15 with a curtsey due in july : @entity3 holds her clutch bag below her bump as she chats to people at the studios ahead of their tour @entity204 bargain : @entity3 's dress is £ 38 from @entity32 and sold out later in the day take one : prince @entity39 gave a short speech to formally open the studios on trend : @entity3 rests a hand on her bump during the tour , left , while @entity237 was also sporting spots at the event @entity240 wore a dress from @entity244 's pre-fall 13 collection last night @entity154 replied : ' completely -- go for it			1
' @entity3 looked on anxiously and said : ' you 're trying to throw him off ! ' afterwards mr @entity154 said : ' that was amazing -- it was great fun			0
' as it moved this way and that , @entity3 asked one of the technicians : ' would they be acting whilst on that ? ' across the hall the trio met @entity12 author @entity237 and producer of all eight movies @entity260			1
he said of meeting the royals : ' they all asked about the films -- they really like the films			0
' he said that @entity3 was enthusiastic about how the movies attract continue to attract all ages			0
' she was saying how the films were very much loved by the younger generations as well			0
' in a speech to formally open the studios @entity39 could n't resist making a joke at his brother 's expense saying : ' to be honest , i ’m over the moon just to have seen the real @entity61 and @entity157 – you do n’t do baby seats for those cars , do you , by any chance ? ' on the other hand @entity42 ’s just excited to see a real life talking owl in the @entity12 studios			1
i have n’t told him yet that @entity12 is fictional , so please keep the secret for a little longer			0
‬ ' he then held up a lifesize clapperboard and said : ' @entity44 studios @entity45			0
' the visit will culminate with them hosting a most unusual meeting for their @entity289 in the @entity91 , one of the original sets from the @entity12 film series			1
the @entity289 is a collection of charities , of which the @entity15 and @entity3 and prince @entity42 are patrons			1
started in 2006 , it provides a platform for collaborative activity between the 35 participating charities and organisations who meet twice a year to discuss ideas and ways to support each other			0
during the first part of today 's @entity306 , the @entity15 and @entity3 and prince @entity42 will also meet some of the creative teams from recent @entity308 and be given an insight into the film making process as well as being shown some of the props and costumes from those films			1
@entity308 ’ £ 100 million facility , the first of its kind to be built in the @entity319 in 70 years , accounts for a third of the dedicated major feature film production stage space in the @entity319			0
it is the only film studio in the country to be owned and operated by a major @entity325 studio			0

the first production to shoot there since the redevelopment was @entity348 , directed by @entity349 and starring @entity350 and @entity351			0
woman behind the magic : @entity3 meets @entity12 author @entity237 too much time filming indoors ? the royals did n't meet @entity12 star @entity356 as he was at @entity357 today looking paler than usual @entity358 - the making of @entity12 takes guests behind the scenes of the @entity12 films and showcases the incredible @entity319 talent , creativity and artistry that went into bringing the series to life .			1
