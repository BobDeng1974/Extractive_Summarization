@entity0 has pulled out as a @entity2 pundit for @entity3 as he closes in on a deal to become @entity6 's assistant at @entity7			1
the former @entity9 midfielder turned down the job as @entity12 manager but is on the brink of a move to @entity15 as he chooses to concentrate on his coaching career rather than his media commitments			1
an @entity3 spokesperson said : ' @entity0 has been a tremendous part of our pundit team in recent years , but we fully understand his decision to concentrate wholly on his coaching			1
we wish him every success for the future			0
the tough - tackling midfielder fell out with @entity29 boss @entity52 ahead of the 2002 @entity2 in @entity53 and @entity54 after being left unimpressed by his country 's preparation for the tournament			1
@entity0 , who was playing for @entity9 at the time , had a furious row with @entity52 and told him : ' @entity52 , you 're a liar ... you 're a f * * * * * * w * * * * *			2
i did n't rate you as a player , i do n't rate you as a manager , and i do n't rate you as a person			0
you 're a f * * * * * * w * * * * * and you can stick your @entity2 up your a * * *			0
the only reason i have any dealings with you is that somehow you are the manager of my country ! you can stick it up your b * * * * * * *			0
' unsurprisingly he was sent home by his manager			0
@entity0 has been a regular pundit for @entity3 's @entity36 and @entity37 coverage in recent years , winning plaudits for his straight - talking and honest approach			2
he was involved in the channel 's @entity2 launch just two weeks ago alongside fellow pundits @entity79 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity29 boss @entity28			2
but appearing with @entity28 at an event in @entity84 , @entity0 confirmed that he will not travel to @entity38 for this summer 's international showpiece			2
@entity0 had been expected to be appointed as @entity87 ’s successor at @entity88 after talks but the 42 - year - old instead chose to work with @entity6 , as the role would allow to also continue as @entity93 ’s no 2 with the @entity29			1
@entity6 and @entity0 held talks before @entity12 ’s failed attempt to land their former midfielder and he will replace former assistant manager @entity97 , who was sacked last month			1
his new role at @entity15 , where he will try to help the club improve on their miserable 15th place finish last season , may also be able to accommodate his role as a pundit for @entity3 on @entity36 nights			0
new era : @entity97 ( right ) was sacked by @entity7 after an incident that took place in april helping out : @entity108 ( left ) was promoted to a coaching role during @entity97 's suspension			0
