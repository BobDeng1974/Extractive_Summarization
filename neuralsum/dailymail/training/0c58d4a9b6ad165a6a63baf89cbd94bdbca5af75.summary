by @entity0 a stretch of @entity2 ’ highest mountain @entity3 has been put on the market for £ 7million after a sheep farmer decided to sell up			2
@entity7 from @entity8 , @entity9 , has decided to give someone else the opportunity to own a 600 - acre slice of the picturesque landscape on the northern slopes of the mountain			1
the 76 - year - old , who still farms the land , bought the area in 1986 and says if it sells he will use the money to buy another farm lower down the mountain after facing difficulties in hill - farming			1
@entity25 ( pictured ) is part of the area for sale and is known as one of the top spots for rock climbing he told @entity33 : ‘ the reason we are selling is because it has become very difficult to farm , especially in the past two years			1
‘ people were saying they were worried about the environment and they were n’t happy about the way the land was being farmed			1
‘ so i was thinking of giving them the chance by allowing them to buy the acres			0
’ mr @entity7 said he will not be selling the land to another farmer as he will remain farming on his remaining 600 - acres			1
‘ it will go to someone who wants to look after the environment			0
‘ people can come there with their children and bring their tents			0
schools will be able to come up and see a different area of the mountain			0
’ mr @entity7 , 76 , said he is selling as the area has become difficult to farm , particularly in the last two years the area for sale includes one of @entity62 ’s top rock climbing spots , @entity63 , and a 112 - acre space called @entity65 , which is on the market for £ 2.5million			1
remaining land will be sold off acre - by - acre at a cost of £ 12,000			2
but mr @entity7 , the former chairman of the independent @entity69 , says he does n’t mind if there are no takers , as he will carry on as he had done			1
‘ we just want to give those people that want to take care of the environment the chance to do so and so they can understand what it has been like for hill - farmers			1
‘ if we make enough money we will buy a farm lower down the mountain but we will also keep our current one			0
’ @entity85 , the director of the @entity86 , told the @entity87 that he hoped the proposal is ‘ motivated by a desire to protect the “ iconic landscape , precious mountain habitats , rare wildlife , and the “ mountain experience ' ” rather than the “ potential income of £ 7.5million ”			0
’ the 600 - acre area on sale is in the national park ( shown on map in relation to @entity100 ) he added : ‘ fortunately , much of the land is a @entity102 and nearly all of it is a @entity105 and a @entity106			2
it is unlikely @entity3 will end up spattered with private glamping sites or such eyesores			0
’ agents acting for mr @entity7 have created an invite - only website to market the land to limit the number of potential buyers			1
it describes the land as ‘ one of the wonders of @entity2 ’ and ‘ one of the most visited tourist attractions in the @entity62 ’			0
the advertisement states : ‘ a large part of the @entity3 massif is up for sale and @entity7 is calling on all conservationists and the public in general to grasp the opportunity to buy a part of @entity3 to help conserve and cultivate its natural beauty for generations to come			2
‘ @entity3 or @entity3 in @entity2 is the highest mountain in @entity2 and is the home to a number of rare plant and bird species including the world renowned @entity138 artic - alpine plant , treasured by the @entity2 nation			0
’ ownership of @entity3 is shared between the @entity141 , the national park authority and a private trust .			0
