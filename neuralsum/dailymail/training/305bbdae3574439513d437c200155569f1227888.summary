once upon a time in @entity1 , the @entity0 left back @entity2 made his debut in a derby game across town at @entity6			1
hauled off at half - time , the combative little @entity7 reflected colourfully that his first taste of @entity11 football had been akin to spending the afternoon ‘ in a washing machine ’			1
years later and not much has changed and another @entity7 has arrived in town to bear witness to the rough and tumble			1
@entity15 is 6ft 2in and looks like he could carry a washing machine on his back			1
nevertheless the @entity6 central defender admitted this week that he is only just finding his feet in the @entity20 following an introduction to life in @entity11 that has led to some pretty miserable days			1
@entity15 has endured a difficult start to his life at @entity6 , but is ready to step up @entity15 scored an own goal and gave away a penalty in the 4 - 2 win over @entity28 earlier this season ‘ i have spent a lot of time at home watching and studying games i have played in , ’ @entity15 told @entity29			1
‘ i do that at home on my own			2
i try to use that information for the next game			2
‘ it ’s all about improving your game			2
‘ watching 90 minutes is too much so , if we play on saturday , i will probably watch the first 45 minutes on sunday then go and do something else			2
life has to go on			1
then i may sit down for the second half on a monday			1
it ’s all about attention to detail and doing everything you can to improve			1
if you want to improve then you have to work hard , there is no substitute for it			1
’ @entity15 arrived in @entity11 at the end of the transfer window for £ 32million , the final piece in the @entity6 jigsaw			1
a september debut at home in a 1 - 1 draw with @entity62 passed without much trouble			2
a new star had seemingly arrived at the @entity65			2
the @entity7 defender , who has impressed in the @entity67 , holds off @entity69 's @entity68 up against the likes of @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity15 has shown flashes of why @entity6 paid £ 32million for him @entity15 has found it tough to adapt to life in the @entity20 , with the pace and physicality of the game @entity80 ( @entity81 ) now one of the best players in the world , things were not always so rosy for @entity80			1
after moving to the @entity20 , the one - time left back initially struggled			1
it took him two years , three managers and 25 games to experience a league win			2
@entity92 ( @entity93 ) the @entity94 arrived with a big reputation and a price tag to match			2
but his first season was shaky , typified by his display in a 5 - 1 defeat by @entity101			2
he is now among @entity93 ’s best players , and the effect his absence had on their league form in the 2012 - 13 season shows how valuable he is			0
@entity2 ( @entity0 ) the left back made a miserable debut at @entity6 in 2006			1
he was substituted at half time with @entity0 2 - 0 down			1
@entity2 admitted he was struggling to adapt to the @entity11 game but became a cornerstone in the @entity0 defence			0
@entity114 ( @entity115 ) there was never any doubting the @entity119 ’s talent , but his runaway - train style of play made him a liability in his first season			0
twelve years later @entity124 has two league titles and three @entity126 to his name			0
@entity128 ( @entity0 ) signed in january 2006 , @entity129 was in and out of the @entity0 team in his early months at the club as he adapted to @entity11			1
but the @entity132 would form a formidable defensive partnership with @entity134			0
next up , though , was a trip to @entity28 and suddenly somebody turned on the spin cycle			0
an own goal , a penalty conceded and a yellow card in one afternoon			0
‘ i spoke with @entity143 ( @entity144 ) and @entity145 ( @entity146 ) , ’ he said			0
‘ they warned me about how it ’s different but they can tell you , “ oh yeah , you get pressed all the time , it ’s going to be physical , it ’s going to be hard , they ’re going to play the ball behind you , you ’re going to have to turn , you ’re going to get players who are good with it into feet and who turn and run ”			1
‘ they can go through every situation , but until you have actually experienced it , until you ’ve lived all that , you ca n’t appreciate it			0
and you ca n’t react and improve until you have experienced it			1
‘ you appreciate people giving you advice and trying to help , but a lot of it is seeing it for yourself and dealing with it and improving at it over time through hard work			1
’ since that day on @entity176 , @entity15 ’s learning curve has been steep			1
it is just one of the reasons he took the unusual step of requesting this interview himself			0
it was time , he felt , to introduce himself to @entity11 football followers and assure those of a sky blue persuasion that he is working hard to adapt			2
‘ i wanted to speak because i have n’t spoken to the public at all , ’ he said			0
‘ i would like the fans to know a bit more about me as a person			0
they see me on the field but they do n’t know me			0
‘ i have tried to make the adaptation quick but you have to be patient and hope that other people will be patient with you			0
there has been ( media ) criticism but i ’m cool with that			0
if you ca n’t take that you should n’t be a footballer			0
‘ all over @entity72 you have ex-players on tv who criticise you			0
it does n’t worry me			0
i am my biggest critic			0
i know i am moving forwards and adapting			0
’ @entity15 keeps the ball away from @entity208 's @entity207 , as he looks to build on his recent run of form the centre back knows it will take time , and hard work , to adapt to the pressures of the @entity215 as it happens , the day his invitation to meet and talk is passed on he goes on to contribute his finest performance in a @entity6 shirt as he and @entity144 guide @entity222 ’s team to a clean sheet at @entity69 in the @entity67			1
there was no @entity225 that day and there will be no @entity225 at home to @entity228 on saturday lunchtime in the @entity20			1
the @entity6 captain ’s hamstring troubles have struck again and @entity15 and @entity144 will be centre halves for the foreseeable future			1
it seems as though better form has arrived just at the right time			2
@entity236 may yet transpire to be a pivotal night			0
‘ i would say that playing against @entity62 back at the start was n’t particularly a typical @entity11 game , it ’s the sort of football i ’m more used to , ’ he reflected			2
despite receiving plenty of criticism , @entity15 is determined that he can be a success at @entity6 the defender knows his style of football is more suited to @entity72 , so he must work on his domestic form ‘ @entity69 , too , in the @entity67 was a different style of football to the @entity20 , so that was ok			1
but i must emphasise i ’m still going through a settling - in period so coming up against teams like @entity28 and @entity228 this weekend and facing that typical @entity11 style , where it ’s a long ball , high balls , balls in the air , big physical battles , fighting for every ball , that is the stuff i ’m going to take longer to get used to			2
‘ maybe that ’s harder for me than games against the big teams at the moment			0
i will improve and i will cope with that , but it ’s all about taking it stage by stage			2
‘ it ’s all right having one good game there and then not so good there			0
what i have got to aim at is consistency and having a good game every game rather than in - and - out performances			0
i am confident that will happen			0
’ the day we meet , @entity15 is also talking to students from east @entity1 ’s @entity279			1
the college lies on 5.5 acres of land donated by @entity6 for community use near the new training ground			1
@entity15 answered questions from the students in @entity6 ’s new media conference room and shortly afterwards the 23 - year - old tackled the more thorny issue of interest last summer from arch - rivals @entity0			1
@entity15 's good form has arrived at just the right time , with @entity6 skipper @entity225 out of action @entity225 has again been beset by injuries , this time to his hamstring , ruling him out for some time there were suggestions from @entity297 that @entity15 would rather have joined @entity0 , but the former @entity299 player said : ‘ i was aware there had been some contact from @entity0 , but the major conversations that had gone on with my agent were with @entity6 and it was @entity6 that i was attracted to all the way through			1
i was aware of what a great project and plans the club had			2
‘ they want to make history and i want to be part of that and did back in the summer			2
i ’m pleased i made the right choice			0
’ born in @entity7 , @entity15 moved to @entity313 at the age of five as his mother sought a better life for his disabled brother			1
his first club was @entity319 and @entity15 was a centre forward until he was 16			1
back then his hero was @entity322 and , by coincidence , @entity322 announced his retirement just moments before we met this week			0
since his impressive debut in the 1 - 1 draw against @entity62 , @entity15 has been exposed at times with an extended run in the side likely , it is time for the @entity7 to show he has what it takes with @entity222 and @entity6 suffering an injury crisis among their forwards , @entity15 joked that he was ready to come to the rescue over an intense @entity337 period he claimed to be relishing			1
‘ yeah absolutely , ’ he laughed			0
' i ’m going to play no 9			0
‘ we are about to hit the @entity341 period and i am fascinated by it			0
in @entity7 and other countries we do n’t play over this period so i am really looking forward to seeing what it is like			1
i am excited about it			0
i want to experience it			0
’ it is impossible not to admire @entity15 ’s enthusiasm			1
it is indicative of a refreshing attitude			0
city are about to play five games in 15 days , though			0
time to open the door to the washing machine .			2

@entity6 defender @entity15 joined this summer for £ 32m
@entity7 centre half has had a difficult start to life at his new club
physical *challenge* of the @entity20 still causing defender problems
but with @entity225 out injured , now is the time for @entity15 to shine
@entity15 is determined to improve , but admits it will take time
