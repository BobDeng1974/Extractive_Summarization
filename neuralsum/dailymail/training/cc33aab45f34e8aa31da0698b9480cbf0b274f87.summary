by @entity0 asteroid and comet impacts can cause widespread ecological havoc , killing off plants and animals on regional , and even global , scales			2
but new research from @entity8 shows that impacts can also preserve the signatures of ancient life at the time of an impact			1
the find also suggests that molten glass created when an asteroid or comet hits a planet could be a good place to look for signs of ancient life on other planets , including @entity22			1
new research has shown that glass created during a searing asteroid impact can actually trap microscopic signs of life for millions of years			1
electron microscope images of cellular structures preserved in ' impact amber ' are pictured a research team led by @entity8 geologist @entity32 found fragments of leaves and preserved organic compounds lodged inside glass created by a several ancient impacts in @entity38			1
the material could provide a snapshot of environmental conditions at the time of those impacts			0
bits of plant life encapsulated in molten glass by asteroid and comet impacts millions of years ago give geologists information about climate and life forms on ancient @entity53			1
scientists exploring large fields of impact glass in @entity38 suggest that what happened on @entity53 might well have happened on @entity22 millions of years ago			1
the scorching heat produced by asteroid or comet impacts can melt tons of soil and rock , some of which forms glass as it cools			2
the soil of eastern @entity38 , south of @entity68 , is rife with impact glass created by at least seven different impacts that occurred between 6,000 and 9 million years ago , according to @entity71			1
one of those impacts , dated to around 3 million years ago , coincides with the disappearance of 35 animal genera			2
@entity75 is a 3d scanning electron microscope animation of preserved leaves similar to those at asteroid sites bizarre tubular structures thought to be created when microbes drilled through impact glass following an asteroid strike are pictured here a separate group spotted the bizarre tubular features in meteorite - created glass at a crater in @entity87 ' we know these were major impacts because of the shocked minerals trapped inside with plant materials , ' @entity71 said			1
' these glasses are present in different layers of sediment throughout an area about the size of @entity97			0
' @entity99 flowed on the surface of @entity22 as recently as 200,000 years ago , new research suggests			1
a young crater in the red planet 's southern hemisphere contains well - preserved gullies and sediment deposits thought to have been formed by water			0
scientists studying the crater estimated it to be no more than about 200,000 years old , so the water features must have appeared since then , the scientists claim			2
the crater formed long after the most recent proposed ice age on @entity22 , which ended some 400,000 years ago			1
this could provide evidence that life was able to survive on the red planet			2
within glass associated with two of those impacts - one from 3 million years ago and one from 9 million years ago - @entity71 and his colleagues found exquisitely preserved plant matter			2
' these glasses preserve plant morphology from macro features all the way down to the micron scale , ' @entity71 continued			0
' it ’s really remarkable			0
' the glass samples contain centimetre - sized leaf fragments , including intact structures like papillae , tiny bumps that line leaf surfaces			0
bundles of vein - like structures found in several samples are very similar to modern pampas grass , a species common to that region of @entity38			1
chemical analysis of the samples also revealed the presence of organic hydrocarbons , the chemical signatures of living matter			0
to understand how these structures and compounds could have been preserved , @entity71 and his colleagues tried to replicate that preservation in the lab. they mixed pulverized impact glass with fragments of pampas grass leaves and heated the mixture at various temperatures for various amounts of time			0
the experiments showed that plant material was preserved when the samples were quickly heated to above @entity164 ( 1,700 ° f )			0
it appears , @entity71 said , that water in the exterior layers of the leaves insulates the inside layers , allowing them to stay intact			0
' the outside of the leaves takes it for the interior			0
' ' it ’s a little like deep frying			0
the outside fries up quickly but the inside takes much longer to cook			0
' the tubular features reveal more about the microbial ecosystem in the residual asteroid debris if impact glass can preserve the signatures of life on @entity53 , it stands to reason that it could do the same on @entity22 , according to @entity71			1
and the soil conditions in @entity38 that contributed to the preservation of samples in this study are not unlike soils found on @entity22			1
the @entity193 region of @entity194 for example , is covered with thick layers of windblown sediment called loess			0
@entity71 believes that when an object impacts this sediment , globs of melted material roll out from the edge of the impact area like molten snowballs			0
craters on @entity207 , taken by @entity208 , with impact craters clearly seen where asteroids have hit the planet			0
based on the new research they could be prime places to look for signs of ancient life as they roll , they collect material from the ground and cool quickly - the dynamics that the lab experiments showed were important for preservation			1
after the impact , those glasses are slowly covered over as dust continues to accumulate			0
that helps to preserve both the glasses and the stowaways within them for long periods , which in the @entity38 case was millions of years			1
much of the surface of @entity22 is covered in a loess - like dust , and the same mechanism that preserved the @entity38 samples could also work on @entity22			2
' impact glass may be where the 4 billion - year - old signs of life are hiding , ' @entity71 said			2
' on @entity22 they ’re probably not going to come out screaming in the form of a plant , but we may find traces of organic compounds , which would be really exciting			1

research suggests asteroid impacts can preserve life signatures
scientists found organic compounds at impact sites in @entity38
another team also found similar evidence at a crater in @entity87
this means impact sites could retain life millions of years old
and even craters on @entity22 could house signs of ancient life
