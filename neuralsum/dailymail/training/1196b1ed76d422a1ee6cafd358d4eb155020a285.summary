the party seems to be staging a unified stance behind @entity9 as it was revealed earlier this week that all 16 female @entity7 senators sent @entity9 a letter earlier this year , urging her to run in 2016			1
' 2016 is @entity4 's time , ' senator @entity1 said at a @entity7 dinner in @entity16 yesterday			1
' and our nation will be all the better for it			0
' got her back : @entity2 senator @entity1 made an early endorsement of @entity4 as president yesterday at a party dinner in @entity16			1
above , @entity9 and @entity1 in 2009 at her confirmation hearing for secretary of state an aide for mr @entity1 said the endorsement was not made at @entity9 's request			2
' run , @entity4 , run , ' mr @entity1 said			2
' if you run , you 'll win and we 'll all win			0
with a strong platform and with @entity4 leading the charge , we will vanquish the @entity36 @entity35 in 2016			0
' others are showing their early support for a @entity9 ticket in a more private way			0
the potential candidate : @entity9 spend friday speaking at a women 's conference in @entity43 , @entity44 senator @entity45 , the @entity7 senator from @entity46 , slipped up at an event in @entity48 last week when she revealed the existence of a secret letter she and all the other female @entity7 senators signed earlier this year in support of @entity9			1

friends or foes ? one of the signers of the female senator 's letter was @entity68 of @entity70 ( right ) who many are considering as a more liberal option for the 2016 ticket after stepping down from her position as secretary of state last january , @entity9 at the time said she was ' not inclined ' towards another presidential run			1
