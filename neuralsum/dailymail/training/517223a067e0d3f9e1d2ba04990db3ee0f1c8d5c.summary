by @entity0 in @entity1 the history books for @entity3 in @entity4 do not read well but winger @entity5 has promised the traditionally slow - starting tourists will be different when they head to the @entity7 for the second test			1
wales are licking their wounds from saturday ’s mauling and though low oxygen levels on the high veldt will make this weekend ’s encounter even more gruelling , @entity5 , 24 , will take inspiration from recent tours to the @entity17			1
‘ i think they know it is going to be a different @entity3 team playing them , ’ said @entity5			2
come on strong : @entity3 winger @entity5 has vowed his side will improve in the second @entity23 too little too late : @entity5 ( centre ) scored a brilliant late consolation try for @entity3 overpowered : @entity4 's @entity26 shrugs off @entity27 to go over for @entity4 falling short : @entity28 is denied a try at the last minute after a great tackle from @entity31 running riot : @entity4 's @entity33 holds off a tackle from @entity3 ' @entity35 ‘ it seems to be the same situation as @entity38 in 2012			1
we came back fighting in that game and probably should have won the second test			2
‘ the last couple of years we have been pretty good away from home			0
this year we are just dipping			0
mentally i do n’t think we are quite there			0
’ wales have never beaten the @entity4 in @entity4 and this time it was full back @entity48 who inspired the hosts with an impeccable performance			2
@entity3 coach @entity52 would have expected more from his senior figures and could wield the axe as he searches for only a second victory over the big three - @entity38 , @entity56 and @entity4 - since he took over in 2007			1
it is a worrying statistic , particularly looking towards next year ’s @entity58 , but @entity52 said : ‘ i do n’t think there is a lack of belief			0
they bring a lot of pace and physicality and we struggled to cope			0
we will be a lot better next week because we need to be			0
’ mercurial : @entity48 ( centre ) scored a try and played a part in three of @entity4 's other tries on target : @entity73 kicks a drop goal past team - mate @entity75 as @entity4 's @entity76 attempts to charge down			1
