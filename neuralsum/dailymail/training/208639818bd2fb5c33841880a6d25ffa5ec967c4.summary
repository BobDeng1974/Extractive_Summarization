some people celebrate the big 4 - 0 with a big party and others book a thrill - seeking experience like a bungee jump			2
@entity5 is determined to mark forty years on this planet by falling in love			1
the milestone is already an enormous achievement for the devout mormon from @entity12 - after she was born with a rare condition called sacral agenesis , doctors predicted that she would n't make it past her first birthday			1
doctors told her parents that she would n't live past the age of one , but she is now celebrating her 40th birthday sacral agenesis is a rare condition that caused @entity32 's spine to stop growing at the bottom of her rib cage , leaving the lower part of her body compressed			1
doctors predicted she would never sit up or talk , but now 40 - year - old @entity5 counts quad biking , boating , surfing and shooting among her hobbies			1
and recently she embarked on her most daunting venture yet when she joined the dating scene			2
the government admin worker , from @entity12 , has never been kissed - and had n't been on a date in twenty years			2
but now she is taking the mormon - dating scene by storm in her quest to find love			2
doctors predicted that @entity5 would never sit up or talk , but she defied the odds and now leads a very active lifestyle @entity5 - who walks on her hands and uses a wheelchair - said : ' my condition means my top half is normal , even though my bottom half stopped growing			1
' but i 've never let my disability get in the way of enjoying life			2
i love being active and have a great group of friends			2
' the one thing missing in my life is a boyfriend			2
i 'd like to find somebody and fall in love			2
' i also think i 'm judged for my disability			0
people assume they 'll have to look after me , they do n't realise how independent i am			0
' @entity5 's faith also means she is keen to settle down as she can feel like an outcast in the @entity70 community because of her single status			1
but while she is physically capable of having children , she fears that her biological clock is ticking and she is keen to have a family or adopt. @entity5 said : ' i was raised in the church so the church is very important to me			1
it 's a big part of my life			0
' in a way , you kind of feel left out a little bit if you 're not married			0
' there has to be a guy out there for me			0
' @entity5 enjoys a range of thrill - seeking hobbies , including quadbiking @entity5 loves to be outdoors and most of her hobbies are tailored around sport @entity5 grew up with her mum @entity90 , dad @entity91 and older brother @entity92 , now 44			1
she said : ' my parents did n't know i had sacral agenesis before i was born			1
' my mum always told me knew something was wrong because the pregnancy was different from when she carried my brother - he moved around a lot more			0
' @entity90 and @entity91 's excitement at the birth gave way to despair when they were told that their baby had the condition - which affects one in 25,000 births - and would n't live to be a toddler			1
but despite the grim prognosis , @entity5 exceeded all expectations			1
she said : ' by the age of three i started shuffling around on my bum to get around , then i learnt to walk on my hands			0
' doctors offered me prosthetic legs , but i did n't want them , i preferred walking on my hands			2
' @entity5 on a date with a gentleman called @entity120 in @entity121 , @entity12 @entity5 enjoyed an active childhood with brother @entity92 and never noticed any differences between them in terms of what they could do			1
and as she grew older , she refused to let her disability hold her back , learning to drive and living independently			0
but @entity5 never met that special someone and after the death of her parents in recent years , she started to consider her life and what it meant to be alone			1
she said : ' i feel like my life is very full			0
i have a wonderful family that 's very supportive , friends , i have a nice home and i live in a beautiful area			2
' i think the one big thing that 's missing in my life is just that special guy			0
' i would like to find somebody and fall in love			0
' @entity5 in front of @entity146 in @entity121 , @entity12 @entity5 started her search by uploading a profile to a dating website , but her quest for mr @entity151 proved more difficult than she anticipated			1
she said : ' i think i 'm attractive to the opposite sex , i 've had people tell me i 'm beautiful			0
does that translate into wanting to date ? no. ' @entity5 was disappointed that she received no hits on her dating profile but , undeterred , she enlisted the help of @entity70 dating professionals			1
she said : ' i thought maybe there was some areas i needed to improve on in myself and they can do that for me			0
' i really think they 'll be able to help me find the best me			0
' firstly , the matchmakers sent @entity5 for a makeover to improve her confidence and catch the eye of a potential suitor			1
and after a shopping spree , a facial , a new hairstyle and new make - up , @entity5 was raring to go on the first date arranged by the matchmakers			1
@entity5 lives an action - packed lifestyle but really wants to settle down with a man and start a family a string of other dates followed , including a horse and cart ride , a trip to the aquarium , romantic dinners and even an indoor skydiving session			1
@entity5 even appeared on local tv to appeal for men to take her out and travelled 800 miles to a @entity70 dating convention in @entity190			1
and although she still has n't found that someone special , @entity5 is starting to find her stride			1
she said : ' i think i 've got better at dating			0
i still have my profile online and i 've gotten more hits of late			0
i have n't given up hope that someday it will happen			0
' i 'm romantic , i want to give all of myself to someone			0
there has got to be somebody out there for me			0
