new fossils of an ancient primate found in the @entity2 may be the first monkey to have traveled from @entity4 across the @entity5 to @entity6			1
the fossils suggest that monkeys first arrived in @entity6 nearly 10 million years earlier than previously thought			1
scientists believe the first primates traveled to @entity6 , which was once an isolated island before it joined to @entity11 three million years ago , from @entity4 on natural rafts that drifted across the @entity5			1
a reconstruction of the 38 million year old @entity14 ( left ) found in @entity6 is shown above alongside a species it closely resembled - @entity17 , that lived in @entity18 39 milion years ago the two groups of primates then evolved separately to create distinct families of primates			1
however , evidence for when this epic journey occurred has been patchy and the oldest fossil of a monkey found in the @entity27 was 26 million years old found in @entity28			1
a new fossil has the potential to force anthropologists to rewrite the evolutionary history of how our early ancestors first began walking upright on two legs			0
for decades scientists have believed that our upright posture evolved in a common ancestor shared with the great apes including chimpanzees , gorillas and orangutans around 15 million years ago			1
this led to the broad torsos and mobile forelimbs that appear all great apes - known as the orthograde body plan			0
but a 12.3 million year old fossilised hipbone belonging a prehistoric ape named @entity51 discovered in modern @entity52 , is challenging this belief			2
this species was thought to be an ancient relative of the orangutan that emerged after the great apes split from the gibbons and lived around 12 million to 10 million years ago fossilised skull fragments have suggested it had the facial features similar to modern orangutans and scientists assumed it would also have an ape - like body plan			1
however , the new hipbone has revealed that these creatures had a narrow torso that more resembles those of monkeys			0
this suggests that @entity51 may have had both ape - like and monkey - like features , and has left researchers baffled about how it fits into the evolutionary tree			0
but now fossilised teeth , found on a riverbank in a remote part of the @entity2 in @entity80 , that have been dated at 36 million years old suggest the crossing from @entity4 may have occurred far earlier			1
the teeth bear little resemblance to those from other species found in @entity6 , but instead are more similar to teeth from @entity4 primates at the time			1
this suggests that the fossils may belong to one of the first primates to make the crossing from @entity4			2
researchers from the @entity94 in @entity95 , @entity96 , and the @entity97 of @entity98 have named the new species of monkey @entity100			1
its name is derived from the country where the fossil was found - @entity80 - and the @entity106 name for monkey , pithecus			2
@entity109 is named the area of @entity80 where it was sound - @entity112 in the @entity113			2
@entity114 , the palaeontologist who led the study of the fossils at the @entity94 in @entity95 , said the animal would have been a small monkey with a body only around 10 inches long			0
writing in the journal nature , mr @entity114 said : ' @entity100 was a small primate , comparable in size to the tamarins @entity123 and some species of @entity125			2
' the new specimens are important for understanding the origin and early evolution of modern platyrrhine ( @entity27 ) primates because they bear little resemblance to any extinct or living @entity6 primate , but they do bear striking resemblances to @entity134 @entity4 anthropoids , and our phylogenetic analysis suggests a relationship with @entity4 taxa			1
' the scientists examined fossilised teeth ( above ) that were found found in the @entity142 in @entity143 the new species teeth more closely resemble those of monkeys in @entity4 such as this @entity146 this artists impression of @entity100 shows that the small primate may have looked like the scientists believe that @entity150 may be most closely related to an extinct primate called @entity17 , which lived around 38 - 39 million years ago in what is now @entity18			1
they found one complete and two incomplete upper molars that were dug up from a river bed during a dry period in @entity143 , eastern @entity80			1
@entity27 monkeys are typically distinguished from their counterparts in @entity4 and @entity159 by their flat noses and relatively small size			1
there are around 150 species of @entity27 monkeys - also called @entity27 which means ‘ flat nose ’ - living in @entity165			2
these include capuchins , marmosets and tamarins			0
it is thought that they originally arrived in @entity6 after crossing the @entity5 on natural rafts made of vegetation along with other mammals like rodents			0
until the new fossils were found , rodents were thought to have arrived on the continent long before primates but the new discovery means they arrived at roughly the same time			0
writing in @entity182 , mr @entity114 and his colleagues said : ' numerous studies have focused on the possibility of primates crossing the @entity5 to reach @entity6 from @entity4			2
' a similar means of arrival in @entity6 has often been proposed for the hystricognath rodents , the dispersal of amphisbaenian and gekkotan lizards			0
' the discovery of these new primates brings the first appearance datum of caviomorph rodents and primates in @entity6 back into close correspondence , but raises new questions about the timing and means of arrival of these two mammalian groups			0
' dr @entity201 , from the @entity97 of @entity98 , added it had taken years of searching before the new fossils had been found			0
he said : ' fossils are scarce and limited to only a few exposed banks along rivers during the dry seasons			0
' for much of the year high water levels make palaeontological exploration impossible			0
' new world monkeys like this golden lion tamarin evolved to have flatter noses than their @entity4 cousins			0

palaeontologists have named the new species @entity100
its fossilised teeth were discovered on a river bank in @entity143 , @entity80
the teeth are *unlike* any @entity27 monkey but resemble those in @entity4
the 36 million years old fossil suggests monkeys travelled from @entity4 to @entity6 around 10 million years earlier than previously thought
