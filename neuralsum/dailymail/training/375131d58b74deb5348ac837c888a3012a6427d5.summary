' they all have their own personalities but they are live wires and bundles of energy			0
the pups are so close they all sleep together in a big puppy heap			2

' i was worried about her not being of use to anyone after giving birth			0
i am just overwhelmed with the number of puppies to be honest , there were a lot of tears			0
' it was a bit of touch and go with the last one because she was n’t breathing , but they are all fighting strong now			0
