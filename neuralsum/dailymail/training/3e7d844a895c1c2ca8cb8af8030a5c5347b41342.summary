a radical shift in @entity2 policy will see hundreds of thousands more women encouraged to give birth at home for most of those having their second child , giving birth at home is as safe as hospital – and far more pleasant – say new draft @entity2 guidelines revealed today			1

@entity32 , the @entity2 watchdog , says its proposals reflect recent evidence			0
but the change of policy at a time when many hospital labour wards are struggling to cope with the highest birth rate in 40 years , will lead to concerns the @entity2 is simply trying to save money			2
