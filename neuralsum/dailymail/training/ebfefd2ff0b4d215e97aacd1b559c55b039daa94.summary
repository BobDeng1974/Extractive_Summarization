by @entity0 published : 09:37 est , 8 september 2013 updated : 11:10 est , 8 september 2013 university is supposed to be the time when a young - adult enters into a voyage of self - discovery and growth			0
but for some parents and their children , this daunting change has proven to be a lot harder than expected			0
so @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , have helped with the transition , by letting families sleep together in their gymnasium for one final night			1
sleep : parents roll out mats and blankets in the gym at @entity11 , @entity13 , so they can spend one final night with their sons and daughters before they begin university crowded : more than 600 parents spent the night in the gym on saturday before first year students began their studies sweet dreams : three people try to shield their eyes from the bright lights of the gym			1
some only have a mat and a small pillow to sleep on the university opened its gym overnight on saturday to allow 600 parents of freshmen students to sleep on mats laid out on the floor			1
the parents were accompanying their children on their first day of school			0
it is not clear how thrilled the children were to have their over-bearing families with them			0
gym : three men sleep next to a cage of @entity49 and rolled up sports maps			2
one man ( pictured left ) cradles around his bag while fully clothed wrapped - up : two people in this photo have managed to get a blanket each to try and make their night more comfortable popular : the event , which has become an annual traditional , is hugely popular , with almost double the amount of participants since the same night in 2008 the university held the same event in 2008 , when 350 parents took the opportunity to bed down with their children			2
but since then , it has grown in popularity with nearly double the number of families sleeping on the floor of the gym this time around			0
empty nest syndrome is said to be the grief and loneliness guardians feel when their children leave home for the first time			1
even though it evidently affects a huge number of families , it is not said to be a clinical condition			0
improvised pillows : a man and a woman use their bags as head rests against the hardwood floor of the gymnasium awake : a father looks into the lights of the sports hall as other parents try to sleep around him heart - to - heart : a mother sits up talking with her son has he prepares to embark on his journey away from home and into higher education tired : one man looks sound asleep as he sleeps with his head on folded sheets and has himself wrapped up in a green blanket inside : @entity103 flag hangs above 600 parents and their children who try and overcome ' empty nest ' syndrome by spending one final night together			1

@entity11 in @entity12 let more than 600 *worried* mothers and fathers sleep in the sports hall
families roll out mats and sleeping bags so they can rest together for one last evening
aim is to help them beat ' empty nest ' syndrome as their young ones begin higher education
has become an annual event as families find it *increasingly* hard to let go of their offspring
