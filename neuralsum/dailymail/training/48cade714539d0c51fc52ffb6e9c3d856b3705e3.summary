it may sound like a scene from @entity2 , but scientists have developed a way of controlling genes using just the power of the human mind			2
in a similar way that @entity10 uses the force to control objects , researchers believe their breakthrough technique could one day offer the hope of controlling chronic headaches , back pain and epilepsy			0
during tests , human participants were able to make genes in mice produce a specific protein using their thoughts			0

scientists believe the bizarre experiment , in which volunteers were wired up to a machine that read their brainwaves , ( pictured ) could lead to mind - operated implants for treating disease in the gene expression experiment , volunteers wore brainwave - recording headsets linked to an electrical current generator			1
by thinking in a certain way , they were able to wirelessly turn on the gene chip , causing it to emit near infra - red led light			1
this activated light - sensitive cells in the chip , triggering a cascade of signals that ultimately turned on on the gene for a marker protein called secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase ( @entity52 )			1
implanted into mice , the chip released the protein into the animals ' bloodstreams			1
the method of producing protein in cells is known as gene expression			2
scientists from the @entity63 in @entity64 believe the bizarre experiment , in which volunteers were wired up to an electroencephalography ( @entity67 ) machine that read their brainwaves , could lead to mind - operated implants for treating disease			1
the researchers compared the study to @entity10 mastering the @entity11 in @entity75 ' @entity2 franchise			0
they said they were also inspired by the game @entity77 , in which players wearing headsets use their brainwaves to ' thought control ' a small ball through an obstacle course by operating a fan			0

lead scientist professor @entity106 said : ' for the first time , we have been able to tap into human brainwaves , transfer them wirelessly to a gene network and regulate the expression of a gene depending on the type of thought			2
' ' being able to control gene expression via the power of thought is a dream that we 've been chasing for over a decade			0
' to regulate the amount of released protein , participants were asked to adopt three different states of mind - bio-feedback , meditation and concentration			2

this activated light - sensitive cells and triggered signals that turned on on the gene for a protein called @entity52			1
implanted into mice , the chip released the protein into the animals ' bloodstreams those who were concentrating on playing a computer game , produced average levels of @entity52 in the mice			1
but when completely relaxed in the meditation state , they generated very high amounts of the protein			0
for the bio-feedback test , volunteers watched the chip 's led light up in the body of a mouse and were consciously able to switch it on or off with their thoughts			2
this was reflected by varying amounts of @entity52 in the animal			0
thought - controlled implants may one day be used to combat neurological diseases such as chronic headache , back pain and epilepsy , professor @entity106 explained			0
the implants would work by detecting specific brainwaves at an early stage and triggering the production therapeutic agents at just the right time			0
the findings are published in the journal @entity186 .			0

volunteers wore headsets linked to an electrical current generator
by thinking in a certain way , they could wirelessly turn on a ' gene chip '
this caused the chip to emit near infra - red led light and activate light - sensitive cells
it triggered a cascade of signals that ultimately turned on the gene for a marker protein called secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase ( @entity52 )
implanted into mice , the chip released the protein into their bloodstreams
scientists believe the experiment could lead to mind - operated implants
these implants could be used to *monitor* disease , and *administer* treatment
