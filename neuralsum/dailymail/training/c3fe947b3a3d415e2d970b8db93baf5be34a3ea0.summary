by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:46 est , 30 october 2013 updated : 07:46 est , 30 october 2013 a government scheme forcing the jobless to work in @entity6 for free was legally flawed , the @entity3 ’s highest court ruled today			1
work and pensions secretary @entity7 failed in a @entity9 bid to overturn an earlier ruling that regulations underpinning the schemes were invalid			1
but he hailed the ruling which agreed it was ‘ ridiculous to say that our schemes amounted to forced labour ’			1
ruling : the @entity9 said jobseekers were not given enough information about the sanctions for not taking a placement at @entity6 university graduate @entity21 , 24 , from @entity22 , challenged having to work for free at a local @entity6 discount store			1
at the @entity27 today @entity24 , @entity25 and sir @entity26 unanimously agreed that the 2011 ‘ work for your benefits ’ regulations failed to give the unemployed enough information , especially about the sanctions for refusing jobs under the schemes			2
it was also a victory for 40 - year - old unemployed hgv driver @entity37 , from @entity38 , who objected to doing unpaid work cleaning furniture and as a result was stripped of his jobseeker ’s allowance for six months			0
criticism : work and pensions secretary @entity7 said it was ' ridiculous ' to suggest the scheme was forced labour lawyers for the pair said the immediate effect of the ruling was that all applicants who had their jobseeker ’s allowance withdrawn for non-compliance with the schemes were entitled to reclaim their allowance			1
but the @entity9 ruled that regulations did not constitute forced or compulsory labour			1
while the government took the case to the @entity9 it fast - tracking retrospective legislation through @entity62			2
today mr @entity7 said : ‘ we are very pleased that the @entity9 today unanimously upheld our right to require those claiming jobseeker ’s allowance to take part in programmes which will help get them into work			2
‘ we have always said that it was ridiculous to say that our schemes amounted to forced labour , and yet again we have won this argument			2
‘ ultimately this judgment confirms that it is right that we expect people to take getting into work seriously if they want to claim benefits			0
’ @entity9 president @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 ruled that the regulations were ‘ invalid ’ as they did not contain a sufficiently detailed ‘ prescribed description ’ of the work schemes			2
it also agreed that mr @entity7 had failed to provide sufficient information about the schemes to ms @entity21 and mr @entity37			0
but on the issue of ‘ forced labour ’ the justices dismissed an appeal by ms @entity21 and mr @entity37 , ruling that the regulations do not constitute forced or compulsory labour			1
victory : @entity21 , pictured at an earlier hearing , took the government to court over its flagship back - to - work scheme ms @entity21 said : ‘ i am really pleased with today 's judgment , which i hope will serve to improve the current system and assist jobseekers who have been unfairly stripped of their benefits			1
‘ i brought these proceedings because i knew that there was something wrong when i was stopped from doing voluntary work in a local museum and instead forced to work for @entity6 for free			0
‘ i have been fortunate enough to find work in a supermarket but i know how difficult it can be			0
it must be time for the government to rethink its strategy and actually do something constructive to help lift people out of unemployment and poverty			0
’ @entity118 , head of @entity119 , said : ‘ once again the @entity121 flagship back to work schemes have been found wanting			0
‘ today 's ruling from the @entity9 is of huge constitutional and practical significance			0
my firm will now get on with challenging , by judicial review , the retrospective legislation which was shamefully rushed through @entity62 by @entity7 in march of this year			0

@entity9 upheld earlier ruling that scheme was invalid
regulations of work - for - welfare project did not give jobless enough details
but judges throw out claims that the scheme amounted to forced labour
@entity21 took government to court after being told to work for free
