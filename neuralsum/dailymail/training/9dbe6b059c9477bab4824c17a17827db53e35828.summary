the inquest into her death at @entity22 yesterday heard that it was not uncommon for there to be a ' lucid period ' after someone had suffered a head injury			2
the hearing was told that ms @entity0 had spent much of the day with her sister on july 19 last year before returning to her own house at 8.30pm			1
she had a shower , during which she slipped and banged her head , and returned to her sister 's home 45 minutes later complaining of a bump on the head			2
however , ms @entity0 – who is mother to @entity35 , 13 , and @entity36 , five – thought nothing more of it and returned home later that evening			1
she spent the following day at her mother 's house where she enjoyed a sunday lunch with her family and could be seen laughing and joking			1
her mother @entity43 told the inquest : ' i remember her laughing when she arrived for lunch			0
' there were two cars parked outside and she could n't get between them and so she 'd had to drive the long way round			0
' however , after later returning home , ms @entity0 was found semi-conscious in the living room by her son @entity35			1
the teenager came home to find his mother slumped over after being dropped off by his father , with whom he had spent the weekend			0
coroner @entity58 recorded a conclusion of accidental death at @entity22 ( above ) detective constable @entity61 , of @entity62 , told the hearing how @entity35 tried to rouse her in order to go to bed but she told him she believed she was already in bed			2
mr @entity61 added : ' @entity35 rang his father who advised him to leave her where she was			0
' the following morning , about 7am , @entity35 still could n't rouse his mum			1
' there was no response from her at all			0
he rang his father again			0
he came to their home address , got them ready for school , came back and still could n't rouse her and rang her sister @entity77			0
' the pair phoned 999 at about 9am on july 21 and ms @entity0 was taken to @entity79 where it was discovered that she had suffered a bleed to her brain			1
she was transferred to the @entity83 in @entity84 and operated on but died four days later on july 25			2
consultant pathologist and forensic medical examiner dr @entity85 stated on the post-mortem examination report that ms @entity0 died of ' an acute subdural haematoma ' as a result of ' blunt impact injury to the head '			1
he said he could find no underlying disease that could have accounted for her collapsing in the shower			0
coroner @entity58 recorded a conclusion of accidental death			0
after the inquest , ms @entity0 's sister @entity97 , 25 , said : ' she loved to be at parties with the family and friends – she was the life and soul and was the loudest one out of the lot of us			0

we really miss her and it 's not the same without her			0
' a subdural haematoma is a collection of clotting blood that puts pressure on the brain			1
it usually occurs as a result of a head injury and is a serious condition which usually requires emergency treatment			0
there are three types of a subdural haematoma : a ct scan can show a subdural haematoma and an operation to remove the haematoma may be needed			2
many people with a small subdural haematoma can make a quick and full recovery			2
however , in some cases it can lead to the damaging of brain tissues and in the worst cases a large haematoma on the brain can result in death			0
a subdural haematoma can occur at any age			2
however , some people are more at risk of developing a subdural haematoma after a head injury including people over the age of 60 , because blood vessels around the brain become weaker , and babies			1
subdural haematoma 's are also more common in people who misuse alcohol because it can affect the clotting of blood and people who have consumed alcohol are more likely to fall and hit their head			1
people who take anticoagulation treatment , including aspirin , are also more prone to a subdural haematoma after a head injury			1
anyone who has been knocked unconscious by a blow to the head , or who is vomiting after a knock , should go straight to an @entity166 department			0
people who have suffered a bang to the head , but may not be experiencing symptoms , should also seek medical help			0
often hospitals will keep patients in ' for observation ' after a bump to the head to ensure a subdural haematoma does not develop .			1
