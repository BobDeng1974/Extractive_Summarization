children as young as three are being branded racists , homophobes and bigots over playground taunts			1
thousands of pupils are being reported for so - called hate crimes after using innocuous words such as ‘ @entity10 boy ’ , ‘ @entity11 ’ or ‘ gay ’			1
teachers also log insults like ‘ doughnut ’ and ‘ fat bucket of @entity17 ’			1
even calling a pupil a ‘ girl ’ can be classified as abuse			1
the details are also passed to @entity32 inspectors who are required to assess how teachers deal with bullying			2
records of a child ’s ‘ prejudice - related ’ behaviour can be passed to their next school , potentially casting a shadow over their secondary education			1
alleged offences by more than 4,000 pupils were logged in just 13 council areas – meaning the national total may stretch into the tens of thousands			1
civil liberties campaigners warned the practice could have serious consequences for any children labelled as bigots			1
@entity51 , of the @entity52 , a civil liberties group , said : ‘ particularly worrying is the expansion of incident recording and reporting to ever - greater categories of prejudice , which seem limited only by the strange imagination of education officials			1
‘ one primary school pupil calling another a girl suddenly becomes a sign of gender image prejudice , subjected to recording requirements more thorough than accompanying most burglaries			1
a reality check is urgently required			0
’ the reporting of racist incidents in schools became recommended practice for local education authorities across the country under @entity73			2
the @entity75 government made clear that schools were no longer under obligation to submit these reports to @entity78 and should exercise their own judgment in deciding whether to record			0
thousands of pupils are being reported for so - called hate crimes after using innocuous words such as ‘ @entity10 boy ’ , ‘ @entity11 ’ or ‘ gay ’ ( file picture ) however , data published by the @entity52 – and gained under the @entity87 – shows that reporting and recording has continued and in some cases has been expanded			1
the 30 @entity78 who recorded the most abuse under @entity73 were surveyed and 13 continue to collect racist incident reports from schools and six have expanded their recording to include a broader range of ‘ prejudice - related ’ bullying			1
the majority say they ask , recommend or encourage schools to keep their own records			0
in 2012 - 13 – the latest available statistics – 4,348 incidents were reported to the 13 @entity78			2
of the 1,909 incidents where the age of children involved was specified , over half were in primary schools and astonishingly , four were in nursery schools			0
in one case , at a @entity111 school nursery , a child aged three or four was the subject of an incident report and given counselling			2
looking at pictures of people with different eye colours he had said ‘ yuk not black ’ and discarded all the black faces			2
‘ children in the playground had been calling her son “ @entity10 boy ”			1
a child in @entity127 ( ages 6/7 ) , @entity111 ‘ @entity129 was heard calling xxx “ black ” and “ chocolate bar ”			1
a year three child ( ages 7/8 ) , @entity111 ‘ @entity129 called xxx an @entity134 rat , and xxx a rat			0
@entity129 said “ i know i should n’t have called it her because i ’m black as well ”			0
’ @entity138 @entity129 called the supply teacher @entity139			0
he told him to go back to @entity140 , he ’s an @entity140 faggot and a pikey			0
@entity129 then said to xxx he ’s @entity139 and he rapes babies			0
’ @entity111 ‘ @entity129 was asked by xxx why we wear sun cream			0
he replied “ muslims and @entity148 wear sun cream so we do n’t look like xxx ”			0
’ @entity111 ‘ @entity129 called xxx a monkey			0
@entity129 responded by saying xxx was fat			0
’ @entity111 ‘ @entity129 called xxx “ @entity155 bitch ”			0
’ @entity138 ‘ there was an argument in the lunch hall which resulted in xxx apparently calling xxx “ fat ” and xxx “ gay ”			1
’ @entity161 ( age 9/10 ) @entity111 ‘ @entity129 was called “ doughnut ” , “ fat bucket of @entity17 ” , “ fat custard cream ” repeatedly			1
’ girl victim aged 9/10 , @entity111 ‘ @entity129 called them both retards			2
’ @entity111 in a primary school in the same city , a group of @entity127 children ( ages six / seven ) were hauled in before their headteacher after a mother had complained they had called her son ‘ @entity10 boy ’ at playtime because they did not know his name			1
a spokesman for @entity111 and @entity181 said : ‘ we ask schools to record and share details of bullying by type , without identifying the children or young people involved			0
‘ this helps tackle bullying in the most appropriate way and to develop assemblies or programmes about specific issues if required			0
‘ recording types and rates of bullying and prejudiced - based incidents is good practice for schools and is data that @entity32 is interested in			2
’ @entity200 , who analysed the data for the @entity52 , said it was ‘ highly likely that thousands of incidents are being logged by schools across the country , regardless of whether their @entity78 are requiring them to submit data or not ’			2
of the 13 @entity111 primary schools he surveyed , five said they would attach incidents of prejudice - related bullying to the child ’s reports submitted to the next school			1
@entity215 has stopped asking schools to submit the data , but some schools are continuing to collect it internally			0
@entity200 is the author of that 's racist ! how @entity220 .			0
