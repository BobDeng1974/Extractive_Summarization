so spare a thought for this shop manager as she guides her majesty into a family - run seaside fish market today			1
from some angles , it might appear she caught the fabric of the monarch ’s cerise coat as they walked side by side during the @entity3 ’s visit to @entity20 , @entity21			1
faux pas : shop manager @entity23 appeared to touch the queen as she escorted her inside @entity25 in @entity20 , @entity21 mistake ? friends of the woman photographed here , @entity23 , 37 , insist hers was only an instinctive and caring gesture as she shepherded the @entity3 , 87 , along the street according to centuries - old protocol , the @entity3 should not be touched in any way beyond a polite handshake			1
who can forget the furore when former @entity37 prime minister @entity36 touched her lower back with his arm as he attempted to guide her gently through the crowd back in 1992 ? that helped to earn him the unfortunate nickname of ‘ @entity42 ’ then there was that incident with @entity45 , a former cycling champion , who casually placed his arm around the @entity3 ’s shoulders for a snapshot taken by his wife during a royal tour of @entity50 in 2002 , leading to disapproving splutters from veteran courtiers			1
astonished guests : last year , the @entity3 put a friendly arm around @entity56 's waist at a @entity58 reception , prompting the @entity61 president 's wife to return the gesture and rub her shoulder ' @entity64 ' : who can forget the furore when former @entity37 prime minister @entity36 touched her lower back with his arm as he attempted to guide her gently through the crowd back in 1992 ? disapproving splutters : @entity45 , a former cycling champion , who casually placed his arm around the @entity3 's shoulders for a snapshot taken by his wife during a royal tour of @entity50 in 2002 but in fact while aides eyebrows can sometimes be raised when such ‘ rules ’ are breached , the @entity3 ’s never are - and she accepts that people do get excited when they meet her			1
he has shown no signs of slowing down with his royal duties despite recent health scares			0
but it appears that at 92 , prince @entity80 could finally be feeling his age			0
he was seen looking a little strained as he accompanied the @entity3 on their royal visit to @entity21 yesterday			1
@entity80 spent the summer recovering from abdominal surgery in june but was soon back to work and carrying out engagements			2
in any case , friends of the woman photographed here , @entity23 , 37 , insist hers was only an instinctive and caring gesture as she shepherded the @entity3 , 87 , along the street			1
‘ she crooked her arm round behind her back as is natural and anyone would - and she did n’t touch the @entity3 , ’ said one			1
a @entity97 spokesman said : ‘ she did not touch the @entity3 , and even if she had done the @entity3 would have taken no offence			2
’ indeed , the @entity3 accepts that people do get excited when they meet her – and it is her aides who are much more likely to raise eyebrows when such ' rules ' are breached			2
last year , the @entity3 put a friendly arm around @entity56 ’s waist at a @entity58 reception , prompting the @entity61 president ’s wife to return the gesture and rub her shoulder			1

it was the first time that anyone could remember in her long public life that she has put her arm around another woman			2
the @entity133 called it ‘ a mutual and spontaneous display of affection and appreciation			0
’ on the subject of protocol , the @entity97 website says : ‘ @entity3 meets thousands of people each year in the @entity142 and overseas			2
big moment : @entity144 , aged four , looked delighted as she curtseyed to the @entity3 in @entity145 looking good : both the @entity3 and the @entity80 appeared to be in good spirits as they made their appearance ‘ before meeting @entity3 , many people ask how they should behave			2
the simple answer is that there are no obligatory codes of behaviour - just courtesy			0
’ today the @entity3 was one her way into @entity25 , which has been open for almost 40 years , when the near miss happened			0

mrs @entity23 said : ' it ’s an honour			0
we had the @entity167 about 10 years ago but i have never met the queen before			0
it ’s great news for the community to have her here			0
' not quite @entity173 but it 'll do ! the @entity3 and prince @entity80 are intrigued by the glamping pods grand opening : the @entity3 unveiled the plaque at the @entity177 before moving on to tour other parts of @entity21 they also got a taste of @entity182 - style ‘ glamping ’ when they viewed the upmarket wooden camping pods at a new £ 5 million 68 - bed youth hostel in the @entity186			1
when @entity188 , @entity112 ’s operations director , asked @entity80 , 92 , if he was having a good visit , he replied : ‘ well , it depends what ’s a good visit but i ’m unlikely to tell you i ’m having a bad one			0
’ their engagements today also included a visit to @entity198 in @entity145 - where the @entity80 ’s expression was equally stoic as they got out of their car on arrival			0
meanwhile , the @entity3 's thrifty instinct was seen today as she made a third public appearance in a favourite cerise and black ensemble she wore twice during last year 's jubilee celebrations			1
inspection : the @entity3 meets children whipping up a selection of @entity212 cakes at the @entity213 in @entity145 stiff : the @entity80 appears a little stiff as he emerges from the car outside the @entity218 fisheries the monarch wore the @entity220 designed pink cashmere coat and dress during today 's visit to @entity145 , where she and the @entity80 visited the @entity112 before continuing to @entity20			1
