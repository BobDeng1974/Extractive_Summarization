a schoolboy has been told he must stay in isolation until his ' extreme ' haircut grows out , which could take months			1
@entity4 , 12 , was separated from his classmates after staff ruled his ' mowhawk ' style did not fit with uniform policies - despite having the cut for a year			1
the @entity11 pupil now has to stay in isolation and will not be allowed to go out and socialise with other students , even at break times , until his hair grows out - which could be months			1
but @entity4 's father @entity16 claims the youngster has had the hair cut for more than a year - and it is only now that teachers have chosen to take exception			1
@entity4 ( pictured ) 12 , was separated from his classmates after staff ruled his ' mowhawk ' style did not fit with uniform policies @entity16 , a 30 - year - old carpenter , said : ' his haircut is a mix of a mullet and a mohawk			1
he spikes up the top , but leaves the back flat for school			2
' he has had this haircut for well over a year and no - one has had a problem with it before , so i do n't understand why it has been raised as an issue now			1
' it 's hardly an extreme hairstyle			0
i would understand if he had dyed it bright pink and had it spiked up all over the place , but it is n't			2
' @entity4 arrived at @entity43 , in @entity44 , on monday to be told he was no longer allowed to attend lessons with his friends and must report to isolation			1
staff at @entity43 ( pictured ) ruled he would have to stay in isolation until it grows back which could take months the school , which became an academy in september 2012 and has around 1,100 students on its roll , has been criticised for its strict dress code before the punishment involves students being taught in a room on their own , where they are set work and supervised by a member of staff			1
they are not allowed to go out and socialise with other students even at break time			1
the case is similar to that of @entity66 who was told he must study in isolation by @entity68 after his short - back - and - sides was just 4.5 millimetres too short and breached their uniform policy			1
@entity4 's parents , @entity16 and @entity73 , were informed their son had been placed in the special measure indefinitely when he arrived home from school			2
they say @entity4 has had the same hairstyle since he started at the school in september 2013			2
mr @entity4 added : ' we only found out that he had been placed in isolation when @entity4 came home and told us			1
we had no contact from the school			0
@entity4 's father @entity16 claims the youngster has had the hair cut for more than a year - and it is only now that teachers have chosen to take exception ' he has been in isolation all day , every day , since monday			1
he is not in the classes he should be , socialising with other students nor taking any exercise			0
' surely this is against his human rights			0
when we went up to the school to discuss it we were told he would have to stay in isolation until his hair grows back			1
' the headteacher said that in his opinion @entity4 's hair cut was inappropriate and extreme			2
there is no legislation relating to pupils ' uniform or appearance , which is left up to school 's governing bodies to decide			0
but schools often impose bans on ' extreme ' haircuts or colours as part of their broader uniform policy			0
the @entity114 does advise that pupils who do n't comply to uniform rules can be disciplined in accordance with the school ’s published behaviour policy			2
a head teacher may ask a pupil to go home briefly to remedy the breach			0
but if the student takes longer than is strictly necessary to effect the change , then the pupil ’s parents must be notified and the absence should be recorded			0
if a school is considering excluding a pupil in response to breaches of uniform policy then this must be in line with the legal requirements for exclusion			0
' if he has to wait until his hair grows back , he could be in isolation for months			1
this is outrageous and is effecting his education			0
' the school , which became an academy in september 2012 and has around 1,100 students on its roll , has been criticised for its strict dress code before			0
a number of years ago it hit the headlines after it banned female students from wearing skirts after problems with ones that were too short			1
head teacher @entity155 said : ' the governors and staff at @entity43 are united in setting high standards as we firmly believe our role is not just to enable students to pass exams , but to prepare them for life as an adult in their future work			1
' it is also important to instill in students an awareness of rules so that they can be functioning members of society			0
i do not apologise for having these high expectations and for reserving the right to take action when our standards are not met			0
' on this occasion it appears the parents disagree with the school about what is seen as acceptable but i remain open to discussing this in person with them			0
' ultimately if parents are not convinced that the rules we adhere to are of benefit to them or their children they may choose to attend another school			0
' when students join @entity43 , parents sign a home / school agreement in which they promise to ensure the children follow the rules			2
the school 's uniform policy says : ' if students arrive inappropriately dressed for school , they will in the first instance , be spoken to by their teachers and , if necessary , by their head of house			2
' we reserve the right to send home any student whose clothing , hairstyle or personal appearance is inappropriate for school			0
