by @entity0 published : 21:33 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 05:53 est , 24 october 2012 smokers should consider inhaling less of each cigarette and stop lighting up at designated places such as at home or work , the health watchdog said today			1
nicotine patches and gum should also be prescribed to smokers to try and help them quit gradually			1
previously , smokers could only be prescribed nicotine replacement products if they were to go cold turkey and stop smoking completely			1
but new draft guidance , from the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) , suggests a new slower approach could be more effective			2
quitting : patches , gum and other licensed products should be used to replace nicotine normally provided by smoking cigarettes , the draft guidance from the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) says @entity15 has provisionally recommended the use of nicotine - containing products to support smokers who want to cut down gradually before quitting , those who want to smoke less and those who want to stop smoking for a specific period of time , such as during the working day			1
healthcare professionals should also advise smokers that some nicotine - containing products - such as e-cigarettes - are not currently regulated by the @entity34 and so their safety and quality can not be guaranteed			2
but smokers should be told these products are likely to be less harmful than cigarettes , @entity15 said			1
the guidance also suggests tobacco retailers should display licensed nicotine - containing products in shops and supermarkets			0
professor @entity46 , director of the @entity47 , said : ‘ smoking tobacco is responsible for over 79,000 deaths in @entity50 each year and children ’s vulnerability to second - hand smoke is well documented			0
kicking the habit : @entity15 has provisionally recommended the use of nicotine - containing products to support smokers who want to cut down gradually before quitting ‘ if you are a smoker , quitting smoking is the best way to improve health , and quitting in one step is most likely to be successful			1
however some people - particularly those who are highly dependent on smoking - may not feel able or do n’t want to do this			0
' methods such as “ cutting down to quit ” may appeal to people who feel unable to quit in one step ' professor @entity46 , @entity47 excellence ‘ harm reduction approaches provide an alternative choice , and are more successful when used with licensed nicotine - containing products			2
‘ methods such as “ cutting down to quit ” may appeal to people who feel unable to quit in one step			0
‘ “ smoking less ” is an option for those who are not interested in quitting smoking , although the health benefits are not clear			0
however , for some people this can kick - start a gradual change in behaviour that eventually leads them to quit smoking			0
the guidance suggests ' cutting down prior to quitting , by smoking fewer cigarettes or inhaling or smoking less of each cigarette , with or without the help of one or more licensed nicotine - containing products '			1
it continues : ‘ among the provisional recommendations , this draft guidance says that health professionals should advise people who smoke and want to try cutting down to quit , or smoke less , that this is easier when using licensed nicotine - containing products			0
passive smoking : professor @entity46 said smoking tobacco is ' responsible for over 79,000 deaths in @entity50 each year ' and children 's vulnerability to second - hand smoke is ' well documented ' ‘ advisers should also reassure people that licensed nicotine - containing products are a safe and effective way of reducing the harm from cigarettes , and that nicotine replacement therapy ( @entity106 ) products have been shown as safe for up to 5 years ’ use			1
' smokers smoke for nicotine , and since tobacco smoke is by far the most harmful available source of nicotine , switching to alternatives as a short - or long - term substitute is the obvious healthier choice ' professor @entity117 , @entity119 tobacco advisory group ‘ whatever approach people wish to try , they should be advised that there are no circumstances when it is safer to smoke than to use @entity106 products and experts believe that lifetime use of @entity106 will be considerably less harmful than smoking			1
’ the draft guidance , which has now opened for public consultation , was welcomed by the @entity119 ( @entity119 )			0
professor @entity117 , chair of the @entity119 tobacco advisory group , said : ‘ smokers smoke for nicotine , and since tobacco smoke is by far the most harmful available source of nicotine , switching to alternatives as a short - or long - term substitute is the obvious healthier choice			0
‘ we would encourage all smokers to take up the opportunities presented by this guidance , and if they ca n’t quit using nicotine altogether , to switch as much as they can to an alternative nicotine product			2
‘ this guidance has the potential to change millions of lives for the better			0

@entity15 : patches and gum should be used to replace nicotine from cigarettes
smokers could use them to ' quit gradually ' rather than go cold turkey
other advice to smokers is to inhale less or stop smoking at home
