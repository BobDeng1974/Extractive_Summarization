by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity4 @entity3 lobbyist @entity2 testified against a ' born alive ' infant protection bill that would give human rights to babies born after a botched abortion			1
she said doctors in abortion clinics should not be required to take such babies to a hospital , instead leaving the ' choice ' of what to do up to them and their patients in a hearing tuesday before the @entity20 ' @entity19 , state legislators were dumbfounded as @entity3 lobbyist argued that pregnant women and health care providers should be permitted to terminate the lives of babies who are born alive after botched abortions			1

' it is just really hard for me to even ask you this question , ' @entity58 state rep. @entity57 said during the hearing , ' because i ’m almost in disbelief : if a baby is born on a table as a result of a botched abortion , what would @entity3 want to have happen to that child that 's struggling for life ? ' @entity2 replied , ' we believe that , you know , any decision that 's made should be left up to the woman , her family , and the physician			1

when a @entity3 lobbyist said the decision should be left up to patients and doctors , rep. @entity102 ( r ) insisted that the ' patient ' doctors should be most concerned about is ' the child struggling on a table ' she restated the same answer in response to a question from state rep. @entity102 , another @entity58			1
' that decision should be between the patient and the health care provider , ' she insisted			1
' i think that at that point , ' @entity102 countered , ' the patient would be the child struggling on a table			1

' @entity96 framed the debate in stark terms			0

' @entity190 also asked how @entity3 could take issue with requiring a doctor ' to transport a child born alive to a hospital where it seems to me they would be most likely to be able to survive			1
' citing ' logistical issues , ' @entity2 said her organization was concerned about ' situations where it is in a rural health care setting , the hospital is 45 minutes or an hour away , and it 's the closest trauma center or emergency room			1
' when his turn came to debate the measure , @entity57 asked , ' who cares if it 's a rural health clinic ? ' lawmakers , he said , must ' intervene if we have to , to make sure that the struggling child survives			1
' ' i ca n't imagine that we 're having this conversation , ' @entity57 added			2
