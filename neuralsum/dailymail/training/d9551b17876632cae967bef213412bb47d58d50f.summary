the 37 - day - old bear seems to be smiling for the camera after medics weighed , measured , and fed him before returning him to the see - through box			2
photographer dr @entity14 , 65 , also captured one chilled out black and white cub lying on his back with his arms behind his head , at the @entity20 for the @entity21 at the @entity22 in @entity23			1
put it there ! photographer dr @entity14 , also snapped one yawning black and white bear lying on its front , offering a ' high five ' with its right paw @entity30 - ly a care : this chilled out panda cub cupped his hands behind his head as he relaxed in an incubator going for a ride : and another is pictured being carried in its mother 's mouth just a few hours after it was born and another is pictured being carried in its mother ’s mouth just a few hours after it was born			1
other pictures show a young cub in an incubator waiting to be fed a nutritious formula mixed with a mother panda ’s natural milk			1
at six days old the cub is still pink with prickly white hair - and looks nothing like a panda			1
dr @entity14 , a qualified vet from @entity54 , @entity55 , spent four years at the centre documenting life in the nursery			1
she said : ' if a new born cub is ignored or rejected by its mother , it is cared for in the nursery until such time its mother is able to take care of it			0
“ i photographed giant pandas of all ages and documented the work of the dedicated staff in their efforts to save them from extinction			0
' i made it a point of being present during the birthing season for four years			1
' when the cubs are first born they are about the size of a fat hotdog and weigh somewhere around four ounces			0
' they are pink with white stubby hair and are not cute at all - they look very similar to large new born mice or rats and not at all like pandas			0
' the dark colouring appears around the eyes and ears between 5 to 7 days			0

at six days old the cub is still pink with prickly white hair - and looks nothing like a panda dr @entity14 said when the cubs are first born they are about the size of a ' fat hotdog ' and weigh somewhere around four ounces but dr @entity14 added : ' personally , i think the cubs start looking cute at about four weeks when they are un-mistakenly baby pandas			1
' at that age , they are roly - poly balls of black and white			0
they are able to move a bit more and are cute to watch			0
' no other photographer has ever been granted such access at the @entity110			2
' it was very tempting to pet and play with the baby pandas			0
' but since i was granted permission and access as a documentary photographer , it would not have been appropriate for me to handle the cubs			2
' i wanted everyone involved to see me as photographer working on a cooperative effort with the @entity110			2
' if people saw me handling the cubs , there might be some that would have questioned my true intentions			0
' if i did handle them at all , it was in the role of a veterinarian , and then only when requested by the staff vets			0
