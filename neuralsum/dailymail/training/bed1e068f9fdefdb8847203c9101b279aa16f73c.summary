@entity0 , 65 , of @entity1 in @entity2 used to be prim and polite but she now ca n't stop swearing after a stroke she suffered in january grandmother @entity0 used to think of herself as a was a prim and proper woman			1
the nature of her job as a bank customer service adviser demanded she was extremely polite and well - mannered			1
but now the 65 - year - old ca n't help but swear like a trooper after suffering a stroke that changed her personality			1
mrs @entity18 , of @entity1 in @entity2 shocked her husband @entity19 , 66 , by letting rip a stream of four - letter worlds in front of her doctors , in the presence of friends			1
and she has even called her young grandchildren ' little b * * * * * s '			2
the change was brought about by a stroke she suffered in january			1
it left mrs @entity18 unable to control her feelings , blurting out swear words when prior to her stroke she would 've refrained from vocalising her thoughts			2
she now has a ' swear box ' in which she adds money after using inappropriate words , and is working with a psychologist to come to terms with the changes			2
mrs @entity18 said : ' before i had a stroke i would still get annoyed at things but i could control my upset , however now i just ca n't help it			1
' i can swear during conversations and a couple of weeks ago my grandchildren were playing up and i called them ' little b * * * * * s '			2
' my husband gets annoyed because he 's a retired headteacher and gets horrified sometimes at what i say			0
i can get a little nervous too about what language i might use			0
' if something really annoys me i am not able to keep my thoughts to myself and i 'm quite outspoken			0
' if i go into a shop and do n't like how the assistants are reacting to me or even someone else i will say so			2
' i was not aware that a stroke could affect someone in this way and change their personality			1
my close family and friends still ca n't quite accept that i 've had a stroke			1
she immediately called her husband , but was so breathless she could not get her words out			0
yet it was only when got home and found she could n't move her legs to get out of the car that the emergency services were called			0
mrs @entity18 was taken to @entity2 's @entity76 where she was assessed and treated by specialists			0
she remained in the combined stroke unit for more than six weeks			0
her home has since been adapted and mrs @entity18 now relies on walking sticks to get around			0
mrs @entity18 said her husband @entity19 , 66 , a retired headteacher was shocked after she swore in front of doctors , in the presence of friends and even called her young grandchildren ' little b * * * * * s ' ' i would be telling lies if i said that there is not a time each day that i do n't think about what happened and the impact it 's had on my life , ' she said			1
' but i have to accept what has happened and move forward the best that i can as you only get one life			0
a stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off			1
this can damage or change parts of the brain , which is known to cause a whole variety of neuropsychological and behavioral changes			1
depression is the most common , but stroke has also been known to cause uncontrollable laughing or crying or neglect syndrome , in which people do n't recognise one side of their visual field			1
last year a @entity117 man developed what doctors have called pathological generosity , after a stroke damaged parts of his brain , causing his behaviour to change			1
the 49 - year - old began to give away money , food and drinks excessively and even quit his corporate job because he felt he could no longer work there following his personality change			1
doctors said the stroke disrupted the part of his brain related to higher thinking and decision making			1
' i am about 75 per cent back to what i was like before the stroke			0
i feel very lucky that i can carry on with my life as i am and you have got to see the funny side of things or it would get you down			0
' mrs @entity18 is receiving help from psychologists to come to terms with the changes in her life and has been able to regain movement to her affected left side thanks to working with occupational therapists			0
specialist stroke nurse @entity150 , who works at @entity2 's @entity76 , said : ' patients can have a change of personality following a stroke			1
' sometimes words get mixed up in the brain and vocabulary that would not normally be used by a patients is			0
' stroke affects everyone differently			0
' when @entity0 was on the ward you could see that she would become frustrated as she had been so independent before , and it was when she became tired and frustrated that she would use language that she would not normally have used			2
' it is very important that if anyone is suspected to have suffered a stroke that they seek medical treatment quickly so that treatment can be given as soon as possible			2
' on saturday , @entity0 is hosting a charity event to raise funds for @entity175 at the @entity176 to thank staff for the care she received			2
she hopes to raise more than £ 500 to purchase six personal dvd players for patients , and @entity182 in @entity2 has agreed to match donations up to £ 500			0
