by @entity0 published : 08:00 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 09:53 est , 12 april 2013 @entity2 are searching the web for information about @entity5 with astonishing frequency , vastly outstripping those for @entity7 and @entity8 , it emerged today			2
@entity9 searches for the pariah state , which has the world on high alert over its nuclear ambitions , are seven times the previous peak in 2006 when it carried out an atom bomb test			1
last week , the term ' @entity5 ' was the third-most popular on @entity18 , only behind @entity19 and @entity20			1
popularity contest : @entity2 are searching online for information about @entity5 and its warmongering dictator @entity22 ( left ) far more frequently than global pop star @entity8 ( right ) not so interesting : search terms for @entity5 are also outstripping those for president @entity7 , seen here with @entity8 at his swearing - in ceremony in january interest in @entity22 's communist regime does n't normally come close to those of pop stars and presidents			1
but a graph from @entity33 shows how the frequency with which users are searching for @entity5 has spiked dramatically over the last two weeks			2
its peak came on april 4 when it announced it would restart its plutonium nuclear plant having earlier released a ' strike plan ' purporting to show places on the @entity2 mainland it could hit with its missiles			1
at that point , searches were almost ten times more frequent than president @entity7 and @entity8			1
according to the @entity49 , a poll by the @entity48 estimates that 36 per cent of @entity2 are following the news on @entity5 ' very closely ' , with 56 per cent saying the @entity2 should take its warmongering ' very seriously '			0
peak : data from @entity33 shows how interest in @entity5 has spiked dramatically over the last two weeks of those , around 47 per cent believe @entity5 has the ability to launch a nuclear missile that can hit the @entity2			1
a @entity58 agency did nothing to calm those fears today after the accidental release of a secret report suggested @entity22 may indeed be able to launch a nuclear - armed missile at its enemies			2
the @entity7 administration quickly sought to play down the threat and the consensus inside the @entity2 government is that @entity5 does not yet have a nuclear device that would fit longer - range missiles which conceivably could reach @entity2 territories			0
it is not even clear whether it has the ability to place one on medium and short - range weapons , given the technological challenges in making a device small enough and robust enough to be blasted on a rocket			0
the @entity48 poll also found that 59 per cent think @entity22 is willing to follow through on his threat to attack the @entity83			0
however , nearly all @entity5 analysts believe he has no such desire to do so , saying that he is simply seeking concessions from the @entity83 or attempting to consolidate his power			0
threat : a large number @entity2 military bases in the @entity91 are within range of the new missiles - shown here			0

@entity22 's regime nearly ten times more popular than *singer* on @entity9
@entity99 ' @entity5 ' was the third-most searched for on @entity18 last week
interest spiked when rogue nation planned to re-start its nuclear plant
