women desperate to have a baby now have access to a national sperm bank			1
the centre , based at @entity6 women ’s hospital , will be open to both @entity7 and private patients undergoing fertility treatment			1
they will be able to choose a donor from an online catalogue which contains detailed information about the male donor ’s height , hair colour , ethnicity , career and hobbies			0
it will charge between £ 300 and £ 400 per sample , although some women will be able to get this for free on the @entity7 if their local area agrees to fund it			1
the bank – which has received £ 77,000 of money from the @entity28 – aims to address a national shortage of donors			1
a new national sperm bank has opened offering single women , gay couples and those left infertile by cancer treatment the chance to conceive the centre , which is based at @entity38 , has received £ 77,000 in funding from the @entity28 and aims to address the national shortage of donors this has partly been brought about by a growing demand from single women wanting to start a family without a male partner and lesbian couples			1
but it also includes those whose husbands or boyfriends have undergone cancer treatment rendering them infertile			1
some women who want to have a baby using donated sperm have been routinely waiting for up to two years , with many eventually forced to ‘ import it ’ from donors abroad			2
and the majority of men are white which has left women from other ethnicities struggling to find a donor			2
until now , sperm has been banked locally at fertility clinics , leading to a patchy service and waiting times of up to two years in some areas			0
this has led to some women going abroad for treatment while others have gone online to find a donor , putting themselves at risk to @entity74 and other infections			2
the national sperm bank aims to have recruited donors 1,000 donors within just three years , who will be paid £ 35 per donation			1
dr @entity81 , the director of the @entity82 , said : ‘ the idea of the campaign is to focus on sperm donation as a tremendously positive thing to do and that the men who do this are very special			0
women can browse the sperm bank 's database to choose their done			0
it will cost around £ 300 to £ 400 per sample , while some local health authorities will fund treatment ‘ they 're helping to build families			1
‘ we 're spending this money to start something that we hope will grow to the point where nobody has to import sperm			0
’ figures from the @entity105 show that fertility clinics in @entity107 are increasingly relying on importing sperm from abroad			0
the numbers of overseas sperm donors registering to provide samples each year has increased from less than 50 in 2005 to just under 200 last year			0
meanwhile the number of @entity107 men registering fell last year from a peak of 450 to 400			0
dr @entity115 , the chair of the @entity116 said : ‘ we are importing as a nation more and more sperm from overseas , without being xenophobic it kind of just does n't feel right , it 's a problem that 's not going away			0
‘ also i think there will always be some patients who , with regards to sperm donors , will want an individual that is more closely related to them in culture and language and outlook			2
