by @entity0 published : 13:31 est , 9 august 2013 updated : 17:07 est , 9 august 2013 former @entity2 chaplain @entity1 has voiced his outrage at the overturning of @entity5 in @entity6 , saying there 's a ' demonic spirit of lawlessness ' among government officials			1
@entity1 , who was discharged from the @entity2 for insubordination , made the comments on yesterday 's episode of his @entity15 program , @entity16 in @entity17			1
the chaplain labeled various things ' lawless ' during the show , including gay people , sodomy , the government officials who ' refuse to enforce the law ' and lust			1
it is lawlessness , ' said @entity1 , ' and it is causing the love of many to grow cold			1
' following his diatribe against homosexuality and the @entity6 lawmakers who ' refuse ' to institute proposition 8 , @entity1 led his viewers in prayer			2
' father in heaven , we pray that you would enforce your law ... the law of love that prohibits lust , the law that prohibits sin , prohibits lawlessness			0
that @entity56 's highest law of true , selfless love will be established and will ban sodomy , which is a perversion and it 's not love at all			0
' the right - wing pundit spoke out in favor of discrimination in another installment of @entity16 in @entity17 earlier this week			1
let us pray : @entity1 asked @entity56 to enforce ' the law of love that prohibits lawlessness ' ' if your heart is full of corruption or sin or immorality - in this case , homosexuality - then you should be discriminated against , ' @entity1 argued			2
he then tried to prove that @entity75 had advocated discrimination - just not on skin color			0
' when these confusing statutes now try to redefine discrimination and say that you can no longer discriminate against character ... they 're actually saying @entity75 himself ought to be punished for his views , and that 's not right , ' he concluded , somewhat nonsensically			0
@entity1 is no stranger to controversy			0
he was court - martialled for disobeying orders and was eventually discharged from the @entity2 for turning up at @entity89 protests in full uniform			0
publicity : @entity1 publically protested at not being able to pray in @entity93 name after @entity2 chaplains were asked to be ' inclusive ' at command event settings that are n't specifically religious since then , he 's made discrimination against the @entity98 community his quest			2
he has claimed that gay marriage will destroy straight marriage , but when questioned by @entity102 last month about how his marriage to his wife had been affected by gay people marrying each other , he was unable to come up with a single reason			1
later , he published a list of seven ways in which his marriage was affected by gay marriage , including that it had increased his taxes and increased the national debt due to ' tax benefits ' given to gay couples .			0
