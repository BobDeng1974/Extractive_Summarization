a woman who was attracted to her father has revealed how they had oral sex after she discovered he also had incestuous feelings for her			1
@entity6 , 27 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , has shared her shocking story with @entity10			1
she relates how she discovered her biological father ' wanted to have sex with me from the first moment he laid eyes on me ' after they met for the first time when she was 19			1
@entity6 felt full of ' self hate and disgust ' after acting on sexual feelings she had for her father ( file photo ) eventually they succumbed to their feelings as @entity6 recalls : ' we had oral sex a few times , almost always preceded by my descending into a whirlwind of self - hate and disgust and dry heaving over the toilet in the bathroom attached to his room			1
' the sexual encounters came after @entity6 had established contact with her her father two years before when she was 19			1
he lived in @entity41 and she had been to visit him there a few times and spoke with him on the phone between visits			1
@entity6 's mother had a casual relationship with her father when she was also 19 but he made a ' quick exit ' when she became pregnant - so @entity6 had not known , or had any contact with him , when she was growing up			1
she explains how she tracked him down as a teenager and arranged to meet him at a time when she was ' lonely and angry at my mother '			2
describing meeting her father for the first time , she said he ' dazzled her ' , treating her to expensive meals			0
she then reveals how they would keep in touch by phone between visits and had lots in common			0
' when i first met him in person i noticed that we even had the same posture , the same way of carrying ourselves in the world			0
i was intoxicated by our likeness , which i never shared with my mother , or with any siblings ( i am an only child ) , ' she explains			0
she writes how she then started to be sexually attracted to him - and even started sleeping in his bed			1
she writes : ' as well as shocked and horrified to realise it - i spoke of it to no one , least of all him			0
i hoped i would go home and the feeling would go away			0
' incest can occur when relatives meet as adults because ' people tend to select mates that are like themselves physically and mentally ' ( file photo ) it was during her final visit to see him in 2009 when she was 21 that she ' discovered our sexual attraction to be mutual ' and her father admitted to her that he had wanted to have sex with her ' from the first moment i saw you			1
' @entity6 writes : ' i imagine that , unless you have experienced genetic sexual attraction yourself , this is going to sound entirely unbelievable			2
but trust me : it is as real and intense as anything			0
the sexual feelings i had for my father felt like a dark spell that had been cast over me			1
' i was not only a victim of my father 's two - year seduction ; i also felt a victim of my own sexual feelings			1
i felt ashamed of myself , and i had no one to talk to about it			0
i was n't equipped to understand or handle my feelings			2
' after having oral sex on a number of occasions , @entity6 said she then shut herself in a bedroom away from her father on her final night in @entity41 and he drove her to the airport the next day in silence			1
she has n't returned to see him and six years on , she 's still trying to make sense of what happened between them			2
she has had therapy and is writing an ' autofictional ' novel about her experience			0
there were 830 offences of incest or familial sexual offences detected in @entity136 and @entity137 in 2011/12 according to @entity139 statistics she learnt that genetic sexual attraction can often occur between relatives who did not know one another when growing up			1
this has led her to believe ' genetic sexual attraction is normal , and very real			0
' but thanks to her therapy , she has accepted it was n't her fault and is experiencing less self - loathing over what happened			2
leading behavioural hypnotherapist and regressionist @entity151 says he has treated numerous people after they have had incestuous relationships , as he has sourced case studies to appear in his ' @entity157 ' documentary			0
he said : ' the most common form of incest is between siblings which more readily occurs when the older child is a boy who forces younger sibling into sexual contact usually during puberty			2
it rarely occurs if girls are older than male sibling			0
' @entity171 / step - father and daughter incest ranks second on list			2
when incest involves minors its clearly an act of abuse fuelled by power - driven attitudes and perverse behaviour picked up in childhood			0
' there can also be an enjoyment on the abusers part of getting their own back from past experiences of being belittled or wronged			0
' he said that genetic sexual attraction can occur in 50 per cent of cases when relatives meet for the first time as adults because : ' there is usually a strong emotional attraction that gets turned into sexual feelings , though not all genetic sexual attraction feelings turn into sexual acts			1
' one explanation is people tend to select mates that are like themselves physically and mentally ; known as assortative mating			0
' he added that when he has hypnotised those who have had an incestuous relationship , they have revealed ' on a deep subconscious level , underlying feelings of childhood rejection and a need to seek familial approval fueled this act			2
