troubling questions : lord @entity1 controversially escaped prosecution for a string of child abuse allegations because the @entity5 said @entity6 ’s has left him unfit to face trial a former @entity8 has said lawyers involved in the decision not to charge @entity1 with child abuse in 2007 failed to pass new evidence to him			1
lord @entity13 , who was @entity8 between 2003 and 2008 , said that instead of consulting with headquarters in @entity17 , @entity5 lawyers in @entity15 decided fresh evidence against @entity1 was not worth pursuing through the courts			1
that decision meant @entity1 , now 86 , was able to escape prosecution for eight years until the @entity5 controversially announced earlier this week that he is now unfit to stand trial due to @entity6 's			1
speaking to @entity23 , @entity22 said : ' it is a matter of great regret that i was never informed of the existence of this case in 2007			1
‘ if it had been referred to me , i would certainly have given it my close and robust personal attention			2
‘ the grave failure on the part of the local @entity5 lawyers to refer this case to headquarters is no doubt one of the matters that ( high court judge ) sir @entity37 will be looking at in his review of these cases			1
’ @entity42 , head of the abuse team at law firm @entity44 , who represented an alleged victim of @entity1 , said : ' the main option now for those who allege they were abused by @entity1 , to ensure their claims are investigated and for their voice to be heard , is through a civil legal claim			1
' we are currently investigating the feasibility of such a legal challenge			2
' the news comes after it was revealed last night that @entity61 attendance records show @entity1 attended the @entity62 almost daily and claimed more than £ 100,000 in expenses in the four years after he was diagnosed with the disease			2
he only stopped attending @entity65 – and claiming up to £ 300 a day for doing so – when child abuse police raided his house on december 2013			1
even in that month he attended the @entity62 12 times			2
@entity1 is said by his alleged victims to have preyed on young boys at care homes near his @entity73 constituency			2
on thursday director of public prosecutions @entity74 said the peer would not be prosecuted because his condition means there could be no criminal conviction			2
she said there was evidence to charge @entity1 with 22 sexual offences against children carried out between 1969 and 1988 , and that he should have been prosecuted in 1991 , when @entity1 ’s name was raised in a major paedophile trial , and again in 2007			1
lord @entity13 , director of public prosecutions from 2003 to 2008 , said the decision not to prosecute @entity1 in 2007 was made by local @entity5 lawyers , and new evidence was not passed to him probes : @entity1 , left in 1974 , served as an mp for decades and was investigated in 1991 , 2002 and 2007 she went on to say that ‘ mistakes were made ’ , and commissioned retired @entity95 judge , sir @entity37 , to launch an inquiry			1
but her ruling means nine alleged victims will never have the chance to have their claims tested in court			2
and analysis of records shows @entity1 continued speaking fluently for years after his diagnosis and was also alert enough to claim expenses among the highest in the @entity62			2
in the 12 months up to april 2009 , the year of his diagnosis , he attended the @entity62 143 times – only just shy of the 147 maximum possible			0
and he managed to fill in forms procuring himself £ 12,075 in subsistence payments and £ 13,468 in ‘ office costs ’ – with another £ 691 in mileage claims for his car			0
in the following year , up to april 2010 , he attended 136 days at the @entity62 out of a maximum 142 and claimed £ 10,986 subsistence , £ 11,625 office costs and £ 589 mileage			0
in the year to april 2011 he turned up 126 days out of 137 , and claimed expenses totalling £ 34,014			0
in the year to april 2012 , @entity1 attended 143 days out of a maximum of 156			0
he also managed to claim a hefty £ 28,800 in expenses			0
in the following year , up to april 2013 , he turned up 136 days out of 144 , and claimed expenses totalling £ 24,600			0
in april , may and june 2013 he attended every one of the 30 days the @entity62 sat , claiming a total of £ 6,450 in expenses			0
in july he was absent just one out of 20 days , claiming £ 2,850 for the remaining 19			0
pointing : @entity121 filmed @entity122 outside his house in @entity17 on july 8 2014 , in what was is the most recent moving image of the @entity127 peer and in august , september , october and november , he did not miss a single sitting out of 32 days , and claimed £ 4,800 in expenses			1
yesterday @entity129 said : ‘ i have enormous sympathy for anyone who has been the victim of crime or sexual abuse			1
‘ but it is a very important principle that decisions about prosecutions are taken by independent authorities and we have to be very careful not to step over the line , however frustrating it may sometimes feel that people are n’t getting the justice that they deserve			0
’ claims that @entity1 was not fit to stand trial have been undermined by another case where a sex offender with dementia was brought to court			1
@entity149 , 77 , was deemed not fit to stand trial on historic child abuse allegations because of his mental health but he was charged with 12 offences			1
he denied molesting two boys more than 30 years ago			0
a finding of fact hearing was held before a jury at @entity158 in february last year			0
the jury decided @entity149 , of @entity159 , had committed the acts			0
he was not found to be guilty , or not guilty , but a judge ordered he be detained indefinitely in hospital			0
@entity163 , of the @entity164 in @entity165 , said the case proved what the authorities could have done over @entity1			1
he said : ‘ at the very least for the sake of victim survivors they should get that opportunity , to tell their truth before that kind of trial			0
’ a procedure exists to deal with criminal suspects thought to have mental illness			0
in serious cases where a judge rules a suspect is not fit to stand trial a jury can hear the evidence in the suspect ’s absence and decide if the individual committed the crimes .			1
