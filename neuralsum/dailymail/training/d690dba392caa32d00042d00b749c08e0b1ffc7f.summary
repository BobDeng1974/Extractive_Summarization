' it just made it worth every second of work - a whole lifetime of work - for this moment			2
i could n't stop crying the whole way through			2
royal mail is coming under pressure from mps for refusing to mark @entity35 's win with a gold postbox at her home village of @entity80 in @entity81 ' i cry a lot in private but when i 've got a job to do i 'm very set and serious			1
the ceremony was a lot more nerve - racking			2
i did n't know what to do out there			2
' after the last of her four runs yesterday she admitted she had been so confident of winning that she had even learned how to say ‘ i ’m champion ’ in @entity48			1
she had been cheered on at the track by the ‘ @entity92 ’ – her former pe teacher mother @entity93 , businessman dad @entity94 , and her sisters , @entity96 and @entity97			1

she had hoped to be selected for the modern pentathalon but after attending a @entity154 programme aimed at identifying future @entity156 athletes she was told she was suited to the skeleton			2

@entity4 said the final run was a bit shaky , but that she had been relaxed and enjoyed it time lapse : a trick of photography captures a perfect turn by @entity142 which would have passed in milliseconds in real life making it look easy : with a commanding overnight lead , it would have taken a major error today to rob @entity15 of the title mr @entity191 , a retired underwriter , was so impressed with her determination he brokered a deal with @entity216 to finance the @entity15 skeleton team to the tune of £ 100,000			1

i did n’t get curve 14 on the first run right and it ’s an uphill section so that bled my time			0
but the first and second runs are the fastest i ’ve ever gone			0
it ’s not a bad day			0
’ @entity45 , highly fancied coming into the @entity9 but suffering a bad back , said : ‘ it is hers to lose , i guess			0
’ not everyone was quite as gung - ho as that			0
@entity316 , @entity298 team leader , called the margin a ‘ good lead but not insurmountable ’			0
the atmospherics will be different on friday — riviera conditions giving way to black skies and floodlights and adding a further frisson of excitement to the drama unfolding on the icy , twisting descent			0
none will feel the tension more than the travelling ‘ @entity331 ’ , comprising @entity4 ’s friends and family			1
@entity4 was the day ’s top @entity15 performer , eclipsing @entity334 , the skeleton world champion , who struggled with the fast technical course and ended the day in 11th place			1
creditable : @entity337 finished in a respectable fifth place in the skiing slopestyle final on thurday another letdown for those of us watching was @entity337 ’ marginal failure to win a medal in the ski slopestyle			0
he seemed thrilled not only to have finished fifth , despite so painful a hip injury that it crossed his mind he might need to withdraw , but simply to be part of the jamboree			0
