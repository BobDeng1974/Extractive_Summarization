by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the @entity2 is poised to become a petri - dish for the nation 's most ambitious gun - rights experiment , following gov. @entity7 's signing of a law that will permit concealed - carry permit holders to keep their weapons as they enter non-secure areas of airports , along with some churches and bars , and most government buildings			1
lawmakers , which passed the bill by wide bipartisan margins in he waning hours of the year 's legislative session , notably excluded the state capitol where they work from the list of places where pre-vetted @entity25 can now pack heat without penalty			1
reaction was swift and incendiary			0
@entity29 called the move ' radical			0
' @entity31 , the anti-gun group founded by former @entity33 rep. @entity32 , said it 's ' the most extreme gun bill in @entity1			2
' even the @entity36 of @entity37 of @entity38 blasted it , with executive director @entity40 saying officers ' do not want more people carrying guns on the street , particularly police officers in inner city areas			0
' ' we need to have limits , ' insisted rep. @entity69			0
' i 'm opposed to indiscriminate , wild - wild - west laws that put no limits on people 's right to carry a firearm			1
' democratic state rep. @entity77 told the @entity79 that it ' makes us the laughingstock of the nation because it ’s a silly bill			1
' ' i want to know what kind of religion these guys practice that they have to carry a gun to church			2
' but @entity88 state rep. @entity88 , who sponsored the bill , said @entity25 should be allowed to carry guns in more places			1
' when we limit a @entity94 's ability to carry a weapon – to defend themselves – we 're empowering the bad guys , ' he said			1
@entity99 founder @entity98 told @entity59 that the move will set the bar for other states			2
' you will see other states start to adopt this concept and it will spread across @entity1 , ' he predicted			0
and @entity107 , the affable @entity108 who hosts a daily talk show for the @entity110 , said it was ' an historic legislative victory for gun owners and grassroots activists throughout the @entity2			1
' @entity107 said pro-gun - rights forces were ' tireless in their efforts to strengthen and secure their right to keep and bear arms in the face of hyperbolic opposition			2
' @entity122 , a state - level organization that may reflect the mood of a quiet majority in the @entity127 red state , said ' we got a great bill and this will clear the way for some great improvements in the future			2
' the organization was miffed about two sections of the bill that did n't survive the amendment process			0
one would have extended concealed - carry rights to college campuses			1
the other requires churches that want to welcome gun - carrying worshipers to ' opt - in ' ; the legislation originally required them to ' opt - out			1
' ' we keep marching down the field , ' the group said in a statement to its members , ' and one day , we will get all our rights back			1
this is the way we lost our rights ( one step at a time ) and this is the way we will get them back			2
there is always next year			0
' insiders at the state capitol told @entity59 that @entity161 , the successor organization to @entity163 , worked behind the scenes to strip the ' @entity166 ' provision out			1
the group declined to comment to @entity59 on the record			0
@entity170 's @entity169 is the world 's busiest , and passengers now see a sign warning them not to bring guns into @entity176 - secured areas -- but other public sections of the facility will now be open to concealed - carry permit holders packing heat @entity2 @entity58 rep. @entity69 told @entity59 that letting permit holders carry guns into bars is a recipe for disaster : ' instead of a fistfight you get a gun battle ' @entity191 gov. @entity7 boasted during wednesday 's bill signing that the law ' will protect the constitutional rights of @entity25 who have gone through a background check to legally obtain a @entity197			1
' he said that ' roughly 500,000 @entity2 citizens have a permit of this kind , which is approximately 5 percent of our population			1
' critics online quickly dubbed it the ' guns everywhere ' law			2
rep. @entity69 latched on to the idea of bars becoming shooting galleries for inebriated @entity25			1
he said he was outraged at @entity191 ' move to ' sanction people being able to carry guns into bars where , i think , studies will show you have a lot of fights and disputes that break out			1
' ' and there are women , and all sorts of things happening , ' he added			0
' you 're increasing the odds of armed confrontation			0
instead of a fistfight you get a gun battle			0
here comes two drunk people with guns , and innocent citizens standing around ? there 's no collateral damage in a fistfight			2
' @entity69 also pointed to legislation he sponsored in november , the @entity235 of 2013 , which would ' prohibit people other than local law enforcement and @entity239 employees from carrying guns – concealed or otherwise – in airport terminals , lobbies , baggage claim areas , ticket counters and outside in pick - up and drop - off areas			1
' the measure attracted only 14 co-sponsors , all fellow @entity249			0
@entity251 's eye : @entity107 , host of ' @entity252 ' on @entity253 , called the @entity2 law a ' historic legislative victory ' in the face of ' hyperbolic opposition ' from gun - control forces shotgun weddings ? clergy in @entity2 can now ' opt in , ' telling congregants with permits that they can carry guns into places of worship @entity266 , the former @entity268 talk show host whose show was canceled amid a ratings slide caused in part by his frequent anti-firearms sermonizing , vented at @entity274 after the @entity2 governor 's wednesday bill - signing			1
' beyond parody , ' he tweeted			0
' @entity1 's answer to @entity280 / @entity279 : guns everywhere			2
' gov. @entity7 has emphasized that @entity2 's sweeping concealed - carry laws apply only to citizens who submit themselves to screening that would otherwise be considered an unconstitutional intrusion			1
' the important premise we all should remember is these are people who have their fingerprints taken , their backgrounds checked and they have been licensed to carry a weapon , ' he told the @entity294			0
' it ’s not just someone walking out of the clear blue with none of those background checks			0
they ’ve been subjected to scrutiny of the state			0
' deal is running for re-election in the fall , and had n't said until late tuesday whether he would sign the bill			0
the political calculation , though , was likely an easy one			0
the only @entity311 prepared to face him in november , state senator @entity310 , voted for the law , the @entity79 noted .			0

@entity2 's governor signed a law allowing *pre-screened* permit holders to carry concealed guns in more places
bars , many churches , most government buildings and *unsecured* sections of airports are *included*
legislators *exempted* the state capitol where they work , keeping that a gun - free zone
@entity99 activists insist they *'ll* get ' all our rights back ' one day , while gun - control supporters say it makes @entity2 a ' laughingstock '
more than 500,000 @entity25 – 5 per cent of *adults* – have had the court - *supervised* background check required to get a concealed - carry permit
