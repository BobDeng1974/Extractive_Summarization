by @entity0 astronauts go to the ends of the @entity3 to prepare for the isolation and dangers of space			1
and for one group of @entity10 astronauts , that means spending days navigating dark , damp caves in @entity13			1
@entity10 trainers and caving specialists recently went underground in @entity16 to set the scene for space - like astronaut training later this summer , and claim clambering down to a cave is similar to a spacewalk			1
for instance , clambering down to basecamp hundreds of metres below the surface using safety tethers is similar to conducting a spacewalk			1
in space , an object can quickly float away and be lost forever			2
likewise , in caving , dropped equipment can be lost forever in crevices or holes			2
when passing equipment , both cavers and astronauts must make sure the recipient has grasped the item before the first person lets go			2
' caves is an exploration mission , ' explained caves exploration instructor @entity51 , ' and this year will be more difficult as the astronauts venture further from basecamp ' ' caves is an exploration mission , ' explained caves exploration instructor @entity51 , ' and this year will be more difficult as the astronauts venture further from basecamp			1
' for the first time the trainees will set up an outpost more than 3.1 miles ( 5 km ) from basecamp to spend the night , following directions and maps drawn by ‘ cavenauts ’ from previous years			1
' it will be interesting to see how they manage the further exploration , ' said mr @entity51			0
' as they distance themselves from basecamp it will get more challenging and i am curious to see how far they can go			2

astronauts ( right ) will use @entity3 - training programmes such as this to prepare for space as for any space mission , science is a priority so the astronauts will be measuring carbon dioxide and radon levels as well as taking microbiological samples of the life they encounter			2
new techniques will be put to the test using apps developed by the trainers at the @entity97 that could be used on the @entity98 in the near future			0
the cavenauts will be testing exciting new technology for cavers as well			0
a system combining 3d cameras , laser mapping and a wearable computer offers the potential to map uncharted areas in real time and build a detailed @entity111 map for later use			0
' what we are doing will be very interesting and useful for cavers all over the world , ' added mr @entity51			0
if six months in orbit 230 miles from earth sounds like a challenge , take a look at the bizarre lengths astronaut @entity121 has already gone to in his training			0
the countdown to blast - off has included a week in an underground cave and 12 days on the bottom of the sea			0
@entity128 , @entity129 ’s first astronaut for 20 years , took stomach - churning ‘ zero gravity ’ flights and learned @entity132 to communicate on the @entity98			1
and if that was n’t enough , he yesterday said last year he may take didgeridoo lessons			0
the former test pilot from @entity136 , @entity137 , has no fears about launching into space from @entity140 in a @entity132 @entity142 rocket in november 2015 – because it ’s much less dangerous than his old job he said : ‘ i think my future career is probably far safer than my past career			1
i ’ve carried out some fairly high - risk flight tests			0
i ’m not overly apprehensive			0
’ but the 41 - year - old said the thrill was mixed with ‘ concern ’ over leaving his wife , @entity152 , and their two sons for so long			1
the countdown to blast - off for major @entity121 has included a week in an underground cave and 12 days on the bottom of the sea			0

@entity10 claims clambering down to a cave is similar to a spacewalk
like in space , trainees have to be careful not to drop equipment
this year , trainees will set up an outpost 3.1 miles ( 5 km ) from basecamp
they will then spend the night in the cave , following directions left by previous ‘ cavenauts ’
