by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 gives a rueful smile			1
the subject of coloured footwear has cropped up and has inadvertently led to him revealing his less than flattering nickname			2
‘ they call me “ the referee ” because i ’m the only one who wears black boots these days , ’ the @entity9 defender explains			1
‘ but i ca n’t be wearing those bright yellow ones , can i ? it ’s my job to kick the players wearing bright yellow boots , is n’t it ? ’ @entity20 fits of laughter			2
this is the first time @entity2 , who is with @entity24 ’s under - 20s squad at the @entity25 , has given an in - depth interview but the topic of what he puts on his feet gives an insight into his character			1
this is going to be a big season for the 21 - year - old , who grew up idolising sir @entity56 ’s all - conquering sides , particularly as there could be an opening under @entity59 to advertise his talents			1
should @entity61 listen to advice from his new right - hand man , he will discover that @entity2 was in contention to make his first appearance in the @entity66 the night @entity67 , in his role as caretaker manager , gave youth its head against @entity73			1
‘ i was on the bench , ’ said @entity2 , who had loan spells last season at @entity76 and @entity77 and made one of his two @entity9 starts in the @entity79 against @entity80			1
‘ i thought there was a chance that i was going to play but i was just happy to be involved			2
i ’d have liked to have got on as i think i would have done well			2
end of an era : @entity33 ( @entity39 ) is considering his options after not being offered a new deal to stay @entity87 of class : incoming @entity9 boss @entity59 ( r ) is renowned for giving young players a chance ‘ i ’ve heard the new manager likes to bring young players through and that ’s always been the way at @entity9			1
with @entity67 staying on , that can only benefit the young players			1
he ’s an idol for every player that comes through			2
you see how professional he is and his enthusiasm for training every day no matter the fact he has played for 20 to 25 years at the top level			2
' he comes in every day wanting to give his best			2
hopefully , we ’ll have a good pre-season and prove ourselves			0
if we do that , we ’ll have a chance to play			0
’ there is quiet confidence in the way @entity2 — whose twin , @entity107 , is also at @entity9 and in @entity25 — speaks			1
trying to fill the boots of @entity109 and @entity33 will not be easy task for whoever @entity61 selects but @entity2 ’s belief comes from advice the departing @entity33 has given to him			1
role model : @entity67 is an inspiration to young players at @entity9 and almost gave @entity2 his debut hero worship ! @entity2 admits having @entity33 's name on his shirt as a youngster ‘ when i was young i always had @entity125 ’s name on the back of my shirt , ’ says @entity2 , one of four brothers who were brought up in @entity123			1
‘ @entity125 was my idol when he first joined @entity9 and he still is			1
luckily , i ’ve managed to train with him for a few years			0
@entity24 : @entity130 : @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 ; @entity135 , @entity136 ; @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 ; @entity140 : @entity141 , @entity142 , 3.0pm live on @entity143 1 ‘ it ’s sad to see him go			1
he was a great person to have around and he was great with the young lads			0
he speaks to everyone and always gives you advice			0
he talks to me about positional things			0
' if i make a mistake in a game , he will ring me and tell me what i should do better			0
he wants to give you feedback			0
it was a surprise at first but now i just see him as a friend			0
i know i can go to him whenever i want			0
‘ @entity125 ’s a really nice guy			0
sometimes footballers get those type of reputations but he ’s not like that at all			0
behind the scenes there ’s no one better to have around			0
’ can he take his shirt , then ? ‘ i hope so , ’ comes the reply			0
‘ that ’s the dream			0
i still think i ’ve got a chance of making it at @entity9			2
while i still think i ’ve got that chance i will stay and try to prove myself			0
’ on the spot : @entity2 's twin brother @entity173 ( @entity39 ) is also on the books at @entity50 big things : @entity24 under 20 coach @entity176 insists that the @entity2 twins have a bright future before that , there is the pressing matter of helping @entity24 wrap up their first tournament in @entity25 by grabbing third place			1
they play @entity185 this afternoon and @entity2 will be given the chance by under - 20 head coach @entity176 to lead by example once again			1
‘ for @entity2 and @entity107 , they would benefit from working with a coach like @entity61 who will open their minds to different ideas , ’ said @entity176			1
‘ @entity2 is a player who can use the ball and is very comfortable at stepping out with the ball			2
he ’ll be better for the experience here			0
