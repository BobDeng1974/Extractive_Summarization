by @entity0 published : 09:04 est , 26 september 2012 updated : 09:26 est , 26 september 2012 a mother of one has spent nearly a year - and - a - half trekking thousands of miles across @entity2 to visit 223 pubs - all called the @entity5			1
but personal trainer @entity6 , 53 , from @entity7 in @entity8 , is only part way through her quest to visit all 724 @entity5 pubs in @entity2 - and she 's already clocked up a staggering 7,000 miles			1
@entity6 began her adventure after she popped into the @entity5 pub in @entity14 in the @entity15 to watch the @entity16 on april 9 , 2011			1
one for the road : @entity6 , pictured , aims to visit every @entity5 pub in @entity2 only 501 left ! @entity6 has so far ticked off 223 of the 724 @entity19 across the country @entity21 was a sign declaring ' the @entity5 ' to be the most common pub name in @entity2			1
she says of the 15th - century coaching inn : ' it was a lovely little pub and having read the sign , i imagined hundreds of them dotted all over the country			0
' i came up with this mad idea of visiting them and then i discovered an app called @entity33 which i realised could easily help me track down scores of @entity19			0
' at every pub she visits , @entity6 poses for a photograph and usually downs her favourite tipple - a half pint of ale			1
smile ! @entity6 poses for a photo at every pub she visits what have i signed up for ? @entity6 began her quest after seeing a plaque declaring ' the @entity5 ' to be the most common pub name in @entity2 she ’s also collected a huge array of souvenirs from landlords including beer mats , glasses , pub t - shirts and menus			1
the length of her visits vary - from just half an hour in her lunch break to weeks away on trips dedicated to visiting as many @entity19 as possible			1
if the pub has its own accommodation , @entity6 tries to stay the night to get the ' complete experience '			2
so far @entity6 ’s furthest trip has been from her home in @entity7 to the @entity5 at @entity63 , @entity64 - a 750 - mile round trip			1
by the time @entity6 finishes her pub pilgrimage , she will have visited hostelries as far apart as @entity68 in the north to @entity64 in the south			1
good progress : the adventure began in april 2011 souvenirs : the tipsy traveller collects beer mats , glasses and t - shirts from the taverns she visits @entity6 is visiting the pubs in no particular order			1
' it has given me a great excuse to travel and has improved my geography no end			0
' because the name has a history going back centuries , they tend to be the older buildings in picturesque settings			0
clocking up the miles : @entity6 will have visited inns as far apart as @entity68 and @entity63 when she finishes her ale - fuelled adventure a helping hand : @entity6 often travels with friends and family on her weekend trips @entity6 has a printed an official list detailing the address of every @entity5 in the @entity2 , which she takes with her on her travels			1
she uses a yellow highlighter to cross off the pubs as she visits them			2
' but i have sadly found about 10 per cent of them closed when i get there because they have simply gone out of business			0
on weekends @entity6 will visit several @entity19 , and during the week she sometimes pops out for a swift half at lunch keeping trim : thanks to her job as a personal trainer , @entity113 does n't need to worry about knocking back a few pints and the odd pub lunch ' i call these @entity119 and cross them off on my list with a red highlighter			1
' it ’s a sad state of affairs but many pubs are struggling these days			0
' others have re-opened under a different name , such as the @entity5 in @entity126 , @entity127 , which is now the @entity128			2
the dead lions : @entity6 sometimes arrives at pubs , only to find they closed long ago ' i try to check opening hours on the internet but if i get there and find the times have changed i have to go back			1
' @entity6 travels by train or car , sometimes with her daughter , and often with different friends and family members			2
' at first , my friends and family thought i was crazy but they have been won over very quickly - now they enjoy travelling with me			0
' a bit rough ' : @entity6 will always stay for a photro , even if she does n't want to linger ' we sometimes turn our visits into a holiday or day trip , stopping over for the night if they have nice accommodation			1
' the amount of time we spend at each pub really @entity153 of them are really nice and offer a great lunch but others are a bit rough so we nip in and out			0
' ' i always have a drink and pose for a photograph to keep as a reminder of my visit			0
make yourself comfortable : on other occasions the committed pub - crawler will stay the night ' some landlords give me a memento too , such as a beer mat , menu or t - shirt , which i keep in a special file at home			2
@entity6 varies her drinks , depending on whether she has to drive , but her job as a personal trainer means she does n't have to worry about downing a few pints of ale			1
' thankfully , i can enjoy the drinks and lunch knowing my work keeps me active and will burn off the calories			0
i do n’t have a beer belly			0
' historic : the popularity of the @entity5 name dates from 1603 , when @entity185 ordered the red lion of the @entity187 to be displayed on buildings @entity6 says the most quirky was in @entity189 , @entity190 , where the pub is also the village post office , souvenir shop , grocery store and bed and breakfast			1
she has already visited a @entity5 in @entity196 and @entity197 and vows to continue her tour abroad once she has conquered the @entity2			2
' there are also a lot of @entity19 around the world , nearly everywhere there is a large ex-pat community			0
flying the flag : @entity6 wants to look further afield for @entity5 pubs in @entity2 expat communities ' i hope to visit all of them too			1
' i must also book a flight out of @entity210 at some point because they have a @entity5 in their departure lounge			2
' @entity214 , from @entity215 , said : ' the @entity2 pub is so engrained in our psyche that some people are driven to do these brilliantly unique things			0
the lion is very common in coats of arms , second only to the cross			0
the red lion was a personal badge of @entity227 , founder of the @entity228 whose lands encompassed @entity6 's home town of @entity7			1
the most common origin is probably from the @entity187 of @entity232			0
when the crowns of @entity235 and @entity232 were united with the accession of @entity185 and @entity237 in 1603 , all public buildings were ordered to display the red lion as a badge of loyalty to the house of @entity241			0
according to the @entity242 , the eight most popular pub names in the @entity2 are : ' i think what @entity6 is doing is fantastic			2
i hope she achieves her goal of visiting every @entity5 in the world			2
' according to the @entity242 , the @entity5 is the most common pub name in the country , with a history dating back centuries			0
the nearest pub to @entity253 is called the @entity5 and is a popular haunt for mps .			0

the personal trainer admits one in ten of the pubs she visits has shut
