a black man has come out in support of police body cameras after he was gunned down by a white officer during a traffic stop and writhed in agony on the ground saying : ' why did you shoot me sir ? ' @entity9 , 36 , who has no criminal record and was on his way home from his job at a @entity15 café , said the horror of his own shooting was brought home by the death of @entity20 last week			1
he told @entity21 he wanted to see non-lethal methods introduced for police , new training in them , and supported bodycams for officers			1
mr @entity9 was confronted by a police officer opening fire at him as he followed instructions to produce his driver 's license and was hit in the stomach			1
the horrifying incident was captured on the officer 's dash cam and has led to the policeman @entity35 , 31 , being fired and charged with a felony assault			1
he had stopped him over a suspected seatbelt violation victim and accused : @entity9 has no criminal record and was unarmed when he was pulled over			1
@entity35 has been sacked as a state trooper , and charged with felony assault over the shooting the victim said the shooting on last september has led to serious psychological problems which had left him unable to work since and needing to see a counselor regularly to help him through the trauma			1
he told @entity21 : ' i was just an innocent person pulling up at a gas station			1
' the officer asked for my license and i tried not to look as a threat at any minute			1
' i made it obvious that i was going for my wallet and as i was going to reach for it			2
he started shouting at me and opened fire			1
' mr @entity9 said he had gone to the @entity67 gas station in @entity68 , @entity40 , the same state where mr @entity20 was killed this month , to buy cigarettes while on his way home from work			1
the dash cam recorded the shooting and mr @entity9 writhing in agony , calling the officer ' sir ' and pleading to know why he had been shot			1
@entity35 is seen in the video pulling out of the station and then suddenly putting his vehicle into reverse , turning back and driving towards mr @entity9 ' white pick up truck which has just pulled in			1
the clip shows mr. @entity9 getting out of his vehicle and on hearing the officer 's instructions to produce his license , turn and reach into his vehicle to retrieve it			1
@entity35 shouts , ' get out of the car ! ' when mr @entity9 complies and starts to back away from the vehicle with his hands raised , @entity88 opens fire			1
four shots can be heard with the victim being hit in the hip and reeling backwards and falling to the ground as demanded by the shooter			2
the audio then reveals mr @entity9 screaming and saying : ' i was just getting my license			1
i am sorry … sir , why was i shot ? all i did was reach for my license			1
i 'm coming from work			0
' @entity35 tries to explain himself and responds : ' well , you dove head - first back into your car			1
then you jumped back out			0
i 'm telling you to get out of your car			0
' the policeman is heard accusing the catering worker of a seat belt violation , but even amid his pain , he can be heard saying : ' i just pulled it off right there at the corner to pull in the gas station			2
' the officer was charged with assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature , a felony which carries a penalty of up to 20 years in jail			1
deadly : the moment @entity20 was shot repeatedly as he ran away from @entity123 police officer @entity122 dashcam : the last moments of @entity20 were only fully captured on camera because @entity126 , a passerby , used his cellphone to capture the shooting			1
this was the limted view from the officer 's dash - cam mourning : @entity20 's mother @entity133 arrives for his funeral , escorted to the left by a member of the @entity137 , which her son had served in protest : @entity140 led a tribute at the spot where @entity20 died and called for fundamental change to policing to stop more deaths the complaint states that @entity88 ' did without justification unlawfully shoot @entity9 which produced great bodily injury or was likely to cause great bodily injury			1
' @entity151 and visual recordings , as well as written statements , obtained are further evidence to indicate the shooting incident was without justification			0
' mr @entity9 added : ' i could have been killed too			1
i was shot for nothing and even as i was on the ground wounded the officer asked for my id			1
' at the hospital they chained me with both arms to a bed for five hours and released me on my own and i had to use cotton wool to tend the wounds			0
' it was an awful experience			0
i am lucky to be alive			0
i did n't do anything but go for my license as i told him			1
he just shot at me			2
' but this police brutality has to be stopped			1
i am not surprised that @entity20 got shot			1
this type of incident has been going on for too long and there could be others			0
. ' i have come to @entity177 to pay my own respects and to support the campaign for body cams			0
' i am here to support and help other victims of police brutality because i am the survivor			2
' @entity40 police chiefs , in the light of @entity20 's death , have announced that all patrol officers will be fitted with body cameras and mr @entity9 called for the same policy to be followed around the @entity190			1
' these would lead to a better relationship between police and communities as inter action would be on record			2
' dash cams ca n't record everything because sometimes things happens out of the view of the vehicle like in the case of @entity20			2
luckily mr @entity126 was there with his mobile phone			0
' the police in the @entity190 are too trigger happy			2
i am told , they practice shooting around 3 or 5 times a week and that makes them reach for their guns too easily			2
' when they are at an incident , their minds and their hands are already thinking about the gun on their belts			0
facing life : @entity122 , with his wife @entity217 , who is eight and a half months pregnant			0
he faces a life sentence if found guilty of murder and has been sacked from his force ' they are trained to use deadly force and that is wrong sometimes			1
there needs to be better training and practices			0
' i have done my research and i spoke to friends in @entity229 who say the police largely do n't have guns but when they do they rarely shoot and get target shooting maybe once a week			0
' the body cams on officers in @entity229 must be a great help to both the police and the public			0
that would be the same here			0
' body cameras go hand in hand with the dash cams which are very useful in high speed pursuits			0
but once the officer exits that frame , it is no longer useful			0
' but i would say officers must use tazers first or pepper sprays			0
but there is a training problem in this country			0
our officers are trained to shoot to kill			0
' he said there was a misconception that only black males were targets and had researched cases where white unarmed men had been shot by police too			2
' we just need big changes in @entity190 and that time is right now			0
please show everybody the video of me being shot because that is the reality of what is going on in @entity190 today			0
' i ca n't watch it myself though			0
it is too painful for me			0
but that video plays in my head all the time			0
' the officer who shot him is on bail until the case against him concludes in the summer			2
mr. @entity9 added : ' i await my day in court because the details are yet to come out over what @entity278 did			2
' the officer went too far on me			0
but i ca n't be judge and jury against him			0
' i feel sorry for the @entity20 family , because they will also have more questions than answers right now			2
