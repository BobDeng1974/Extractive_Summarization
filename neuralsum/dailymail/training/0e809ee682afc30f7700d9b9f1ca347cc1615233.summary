by @entity0 published : 06:38 est , 6 march 2013 updated : 21:30 est , 6 march 2013 @entity3 must be split into a ‘ good ’ and ‘ bad ’ bank and returned to the private sector sooner rather than later , @entity2 governor sir @entity1 urged today			1
in a surprisingly outspoken criticism of how @entity3 has been run , the outgoing governor said the government had failed to take decisive action to overhaul @entity3 and called the current system a ‘ nonsense ’			1
he said the bank must undergo a radical restructure within a year to create a healthy lender			0
taxpayers will have to bear the costs of reprivatisation , he said , warning that @entity3 is currently holding the wider economy back			1
it can not make any sense , ' he told a parliamentary committee			0
' the arguments for restructuring sooner rather than later are powerful ones			0
' he added it was ' not beyond the wit of man ' to split @entity3 into a ' good ' and ' bad ' bank to ensure the cleaned - up group could support lending and boost economic recovery efforts			2
' the lessons of history is that we should face up to it - it 's worth less than we thought and we should accept that and get back to finding a way to create a new @entity3 that could be a major lender to the @entity48 economy , ' he said			1
sir @entity1 's comments will come as a blow after @entity3 boss @entity52 last week insisted the bank 's return to the private sector was on track and could be completed within two years			1
they also come just days after chancellor @entity58 appeared to rule out a split and reprivatisation of the bank			2
the chancellor told @entity62 on @entity63 last week that the process could take up to three years and cost between £ 8billion and £ 10billion to buy out minority shareholders in @entity3			2
differing views : @entity3 boss @entity52 insisted last week the return to the private sector was on track ‘ the obstacles to your approach [ splitting and reprivatising the bank ] are very considerable ... one has to ask whether the benefits of that two or three - year process would greatly outweigh the benefits of the current strategy , ’ he argued			1
sir @entity1 today said he had discussed his view with the chancellor , but acknowledged that it would be difficult to push through reforms from a ' presentational ' point of view because they would increase levels of national debt			0
shares in @entity3 fell after @entity1 's comments and were trading at 312p in mid-morning trading , down 0.8 per cent on the day			1
@entity1 said it should not take more than a year to a carry out a much more decisive restructuring of @entity3 than efforts to date			1
the @entity2 has taken an increasingly tough line on the amount of capital banks hold and the government has chosen @entity99 governor @entity98 , a leader of the global push for stronger banking regulation , to succeed @entity1 at the @entity2 in july			2
@entity3 last week claimed improvements in the core bank would see it return to financial health next year as it reported underlying group operating profits nearly doubling to £ 3.5 billion in 2012 from £ 1.8 billion in 2011			2
but bottom - line figures revealed the fifth year of losses since its £ 45.5 billion government bailout in 2008 , plunging into the red by £ 5.2 billion in 2012			0
the @entity2 also hit out at @entity110 plans to impose a cap on banker bonuses , warning they will fail to rein in excessive pay and will only force up fixed salaries that can not be clawed back			0
proposals revealed last week to limit bonuses to a maximum of a year 's salary or double that if explicitly backed by shareholders , will act as a ‘ distraction ’ to efforts to change the culture of pay within the banking industry , according to sir @entity1			0
@entity127 , incoming deputy governor at the @entity2 and chief executive designate of the new @entity129 , added it could set back recent progress made to reduce overall bonus pools , defer awards and introduce clawbacks of past bonuses			0
‘ my concern is that in setting this limit , it runs the risk of pushing up fixed remuneration - that 's cash out of the door and it 's much harder to get that back if needed , ’ said mr @entity127 .			0

taxpayers will have to bear the costs of reprivatisation , @entity1 warns
@entity3 is currently holding the wider economy back , the governor said
criticisms come just days after @entity3 boss @entity52 said plans to return to the private sector were on track
