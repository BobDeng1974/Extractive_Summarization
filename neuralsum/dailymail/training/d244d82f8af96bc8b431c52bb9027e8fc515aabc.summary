it is a rare meeting of two of the most beautiful phenomenon on @entity3			1
@entity5 astronaut @entity4 captured the amazing moment an aurora and a sunrise ' collide ' ' all we need now are angels singing , ' @entity4 wrote			1
the video , taken by astronaut @entity4 aboard the @entity19 , follows the aurora borealis , or @entity21 , and captures the moment ' sunrise touches aurora			1
' @entity5 filmed the footage over @entity30 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 before the clip was sped up and posted online			1
@entity21 is the common name for @entity32 , a light show of varying colours caused by collisions between electrically - charged particles from the sun that enter the @entity3 's atmosphere			1
@entity39 are one effect of energetic particles which can speed out from the sun both in a steady stream called the solar wind and due to giant eruptions known as coronal mass ejections , or @entity47			2
after a trip toward @entity3 that can last two to three days , the solar particles and magnetic fields cause the release of particles already trapped near @entity3			2
as the video progresses , @entity30 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 are passed over - as the sunrise ' touches ' the aurora			1
this in turn trigger reactions in the upper atmosphere in which oxygen and nitrogen molecules are released a particles of light			2
the strong solar flare which created this aurora triggered a radio blackout for parts of @entity3 over the weekend , according to an alert from the @entity69 @entity68			0
usually the best spots to see the lights are those places close to the @entity73 , such as @entity74 and @entity75			0
in the southern hemisphere , they are known as the @entity78 and can often be mirror - like images that occur at the same time as in the north			0
@entity82 winter nights tend to be better for observing the sky due to less haze and water vapour in the air			0
the colour of the aurora depends on which gas - oxygen or nitrogen - is being generated by the electrons			0
it also depends on how fast the electrons are moving			0
as well as @entity3 , any planet with a magnetic ÔÄÅ eld and an atmosphere should have auroras , including @entity97 , @entity98 , and @entity99 .			0
