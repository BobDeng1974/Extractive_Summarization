by @entity0 a toddler who hit puberty ten years early has been cured by brain surgery			0
the three - year - old 's condition made meant his voice deepened , genitals grew and skin was covered with acne			1
he also became outlandishly aggressive			0
it started when he was just 18 months old			1
cured : the boy was treated with deep skull brain surgery at @entity12 medical centre in @entity13 , @entity14 when his nervous parents took him to the @entity17 in @entity13 , medics discovered the child had ' precocious puberty '			1
at first he was put on a programme of regular injections to control the hormones			0
but after two years , his parents were struggling to afford the specialist treatment , which was set to continue for ten years but was having little effect			0
desperate for another solution , they agreed to try skull base surgery to remove abnormal tissue in the area of the nervous system where hormones are produced			0
dr @entity33 @entity32 , head of neurosurgery at @entity17 , told the @entity35 : ' precocious puberty can be completely cured by appropriate medical or surgical intervention if diagnosed early			1
' children with this condition attain puberty before eight years of age			1
rare : the parents from @entity13 paid for injections for two years but it was expensive with little to no effect ' the patient responded well			2
it is a complex surgery as the abnormal tissue had to be removed without damaging the vital neurovascular structures surrounding it			0
' his hormone values became normal for his age and he does not require any further treatment			0
' the condition , which produces an abnormal amount of sex hormones like oestrogen before the age of 10 , is often caused by brain damage			2
it affects one in every 5,000 to 10,000 children in @entity63 but rarely affects somebody so young			1
usually girls develop the disorder aged 9 ; boys aged 10			2
more commonly found in girls , the youngest parent in history was five - year - old @entity71 , who gave birth in @entity73 in 1939 .			2

the boy from @entity13 became surly , got acne and his voice broke
*doctors* diagnosed his condition when he was 18 months old
precocious puberty affects just 1 in 5,000 - 10,000 @entity63 children
it is more common in girls and usually affects children around the age of 9
