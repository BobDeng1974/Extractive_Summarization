by @entity0 they are the backbone of church fetes , village fairs and jumble sales all around the country			0
but the thousands who regularly sell their home - made jam , marmalade or chutney in re-used jars may have to abandon their traditions after a warning that they are breaching @entity17 health and safety regulations			1
legal advisers to @entity20 ’s churches have sent out a circular saying that while people can use jars for jam at home or to give to family and friends , they can not sell them or even give them away as raffle prizes at a public event			1
glass warfare : the @entity31 is warning its 210,000 members about the @entity17 regulations take note : the written circular from the @entity36 the circular from the @entity19 ’ @entity36 , which is chaired by the @entity38 , is pointedly headed : ‘ please take note : this looks like a spoof but it ’s not			1
’ the advisers say the rules that are being breached are the snappily - titled @entity44 and 2023/2006 , which prevent containers being re-used unless they are specifically designed for that purpose			1
the @entity31 said it was offering similar advice on the re-use of jam jars to its 210,000 members			1
a spokesman said the news could send ‘ a tremor through middle - @entity56 ’ and the organisation was braced for a flurry of inquiries			0
the @entity57 said the rules had been introduced because there was a risk of chemicals leaching out of old containers and contaminating food , though it added that it was not aware that re-used jam jars were a safety hazard			1
' @entity66 ' : the news will alarm a growing number of jam - makers the agency said it was up to local authority environmental health officers to enforce the regulations , and penalties can reach a maximum of a £ 5,000 fine , six months ’ imprisonment , or both			2
the news will alarm the growing number of jam - makers inspired by model @entity80 , who makes damson jam out of fruit from her @entity84 estate , and the @entity85 , who keeps pots to give away to friends			0
@entity88 , the star of the @entity90 ’s @entity89 , said : ‘ this is absolutely stupid			0
it is just going too far			0
‘ we are encouraging people to save money by using fruits to make chutneys and jam , and if they have to buy new jars it will become much too expensive			2
’ the rules are also causing consternation in churches that rely on the hundreds of thousands of pounds raised from fetes and bazaars			2
the @entity107 , a spokesman for the diocese of @entity109 , said enforcing the rule ‘ would be a blow to fundraising events for all sorts of voluntary organisations ’			0
he added : ‘ it ’s quite ridiculous , as selling home - made jams and chutneys has always been a traditional and important part of fundraising for church groups and others			2
‘ older people in particular , or those not terribly well - off , have never been shy of making a few pots and giving that away			0
‘ people will offer their home - made jam when perhaps they ca n’t give anything else			0
’ ' this is not a spoof ' : church advisers forced to point out ' stupid ' rule to members mr @entity107 said he had never heard of anyone falling ill from eating jam from a re-used jar , adding : ‘ there must be a sensible balance between health and safety and something that has happened without incident for centuries			1
’ @entity144 @entity143 , of @entity145 , said : ‘ on realising this was not a belated @entity148 ’s joke , i was very anxious , not only from the fundraising point of view for all our churches , but also because it goes against the green agenda of recycling			0
’ the @entity31 said anyone using old jars should sterilise them by washing them and drying them in an oven on a low heat .			1

churches warn parishioners to stop selling preserves in re-used jars
the tradition , *enjoyed* by the @entity31 , breaches @entity169 health and safety laws
