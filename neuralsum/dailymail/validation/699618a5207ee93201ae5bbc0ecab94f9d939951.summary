one sunday morning last summer , @entity0 , a referee in the @entity1 , showed a player a yellow card for a bad tackle			1
the player , @entity5 , began to shout abuse at him , so @entity0 reached for his pocket and prepared to send him off			1
before @entity0 could dismiss him , @entity5 felled him with a punch that knocked him unconscious			1
@entity0 died two days later in hospital			1
on friday , as @entity5 ’s trial in a @entity14 courtroom came to an end , the referee ’s widow was determined to do one last thing to honour her dead husband ’s memory			1
@entity19 approached the bench as @entity5 waited to be sentenced and pulled something from her pocket			1
she stood there and brandished it at her husband ’s killer			2
‘ i would like to serve mr @entity5 with the red card that he was entitled to , ’ she said			1
@entity0 's widow , @entity19 , addresses the court and holds up a red card to @entity5 @entity5 ( left ) will spend at least eight years in prison after killing @entity0 with one punch it sounds almost like a parody , does n’t it ? but it was n’t			1
the judge sentenced @entity5 to eight to 15 years in prison			1
‘ you ’ve come to personify all that ’s wrong with the escalation of violence in sports , ’ he told him			2
it was a human tragedy most of all , of course , a tragedy for young children who lost their father and a wife who lost her husband			2
but it also told a sad and unpalatable tale of the behaviour that is leaving an ugly , ugly stain on football			2
tragedies like the one that happened in @entity59 are rare but you only had to watch @entity61 – @entity62 and @entity64 - @entity63 last week to know that referees are under siege			1
many observers still see them as acceptable victims in football ’s great passion play			2
threatening officials is just part of the game , they say			0
anything to get an edge			0
i listened to some of the @entity64 - @entity63 game on the radio and the dismay in the voice of @entity83 as he commented on what he saw was powerful			1
‘ this is an angry game being played by angry men , ’ he said			0
@entity87 was hounded by nine @entity64 players as @entity89 was sent off for a tackle on @entity91 @entity63 players also surrounded the @entity94 official as tempers threatened to boil over let ’s be honest about this : it is getting to the point now where if you want to be a referee , only heroes need apply			1
you will be threatened and you will be ridiculed — on and off the pitch			0
if you make a decision that meets with the disapproval of a manager who is trying to shift the blame for a poor performance , you will be hounded and you will be abused			0
if we carry on like this , we ’re going to have to start paying referees danger money			1
you think i ’m joking ? i ’m not			0
a few years ago , i watched a sunday league game between two junior teams at @entity116 in west @entity117 that ended amid some disagreement about whether the referee had blown the final whistle too early			1
as the referee was walking off , he was kicked by several of the kids , who were in their mid-teens			1
a few of the players tried to trip the referee up as he headed for the touchline			1
i asked the kids ’ coach why he was tolerating their behaviour			0
‘ they ’re just disappointed , ’ he said			0
casual intimidation comes with the territory for referees now			1
it ’s part of the deal			0
it ’s getting worse , not better			0
how have we sunk this low ? how have we got to the point where @entity143 thinks it is acceptable to chase after @entity144 and yank at his shirt ? @entity143 puts his hands on referee @entity144 following his first yellow card for diving @entity144 received plaudits for his swift and stern reaction to @entity152 's display of disrespect how have we got to the point where it is deemed merely a pragmatic part of the game for @entity64 ’s players to fall upon @entity94 referee @entity87 like hungry beasts when they want a decision to go in their favour ? how has it got to the point where some seek to justify that kind of behaviour as shrewd or cute or clever ? the gist of the defence appears to rest on the morally bankrupt idea that everybody else is doing it so we have to do it , too			1
it is a dangerous principle			0
i am uncomfortable with the notion that players should be role models for kids because that is an abrogation of parental responsibility			0
but it is easy to see how the sight of @entity184 players hounding a referee will influence children on a local park to do the same and possibly worse			1
if there is any hope that things will change , it lies in the reaction of the majority of fans to the epidemic of cheating and bullying that is infesting the game			0
this is not just about @entity64 or @entity61 , by the way			1
it is not confined to @entity203 clubs			0
they were just last week ’s worst offenders			2
after the @entity61 - @entity62 game , there was an immediate and protracted outpouring of support for @entity144			1
he was , indeed , treated like a hero for refusing to tolerate @entity152 grabbing at his shirt despite the angry protestations of @entity61 ’s players			1
@entity152 protests his innocence in vain , but the @entity61 playmaker was admirably dealt with @entity152 trudges off to leave @entity61 depleted and facing an @entity219 exit following his tug at @entity144 's shirt it was as if a great wave of relief was flooding over the wider football community that finally someone was standing up for what was right			1
people pointed out , quite rightly , that @entity144 had done a great service to parks referees everywhere			2
he had made it plain that grabbing a referee should not be tolerated			2
something needs to be done to help @entity144 and his colleagues			0
enforcing a rule where only the captain can talk to the official would be a start			0
punishing all dissent , as they do in rugby , would be better			0
allowing referees to review contentious decisions with video technology would take the heat out of the situation , too			2
better still , let ’s stop making excuses for players ’ behaviour			0
let ’s stop defending the intimidation of referees with bogus arguments about how clever it is			2
let ’s remember where it can lead			0
‘ referees are out there on an island with no one to defend them , ’ said the widow of @entity0 yesterday			1
it ’s about time we put that right			0
sir @entity265 , friend of the beaten gambler i listened to an enchanting radio interview last week with the great racing commentator , sir @entity270 , who recently celebrated his 97th birthday			2
during his conversation with @entity274 , sir @entity265 explained that he had always tried to avoid levity in his race commentaries because he was aware that many among his audience would be ‘ haemorrhaging fiscally ’ as they listened			0
i thought of sir @entity265 when i paid my first ever visit to the @entity281 on tuesday			0
@entity282 relaxes in the @entity284 commentary box in 1997 during his last day working for the @entity285 it was a wonderful day in the beautiful sporting amphitheatre below @entity288 and it was a thrill to watch the horsemanship of @entity290 as @entity292 ’ horses carried all before them			2
but when the last race had been run , i contemplated a succession of betting slips showing the names of also - rans like @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 and @entity301 that had brought me plenty of fiscal haemorrhaging and thought how welcome it would have been to have the commentaries of sir @entity265 soothing my losses			2
when @entity309 reacts to defeat against @entity310 by saying he is going to have to ‘ look at the data ’ and @entity312 says he has ‘ no regrets ’ about @entity315 ’s wretched performances in the @entity316 , it is hardly surprising that talk of a @entity319 comeback should gain credence			0
the @entity316 debacle was the latest chapter of @entity309 ' turbulent time as @entity315 coach let ’s not pretend @entity319 ’s return would draw a line under the mayhem that has overrun the @entity329 , though			0
it would merely mark a new phase in @entity203 cricket ’s civil war .			0

@entity0 , a referee in the @entity1 , was felled by a punch from @entity5 as he prepared to send him off
the punch knocked him unconscious . @entity0 died two days later in hospital
@entity5 was imprisoned for at least eight years this week . in the courtroom , @entity341 's widow showed him a red card
tragedies are rare but you only had to watch @entity61 – @entity62 and @entity64 - @entity63 to know that referees are under siege
