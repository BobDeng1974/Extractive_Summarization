a recently retired @entity1 agent told @entity2 on thursday that former director @entity4 's resignation will be welcomed by the agency 's rank - and - file because ' people in the service thought she was a joke from @entity10			1
' he attributed her swift fall from grace to a cadre of ' p * * * ed off agents who had had enough ' of feeling disrespected by the service 's first female director			0
' putting her in charge was part of the [ @entity26 ] administration 's push to feminize the service after the " hookergate " nightmare , ' the agent said , referring to agents who were fired after patronizing prostitutes during a security - check trip to @entity32 before president @entity26 's 2012 visit			1
@entity34 resigned wednesday following an angry , tense congressional hearing the day before , which focused on a trio of headaches that erupted in a matter of days			0
this week more dirt surfaced , including a story in the @entity65 about an armed security guard who got into an elevator with @entity26 during his september visit to the @entity69			0
the president 's protective detail , it has emerged , was unaware the man was carrying a gun and had n't vetted him at all			2
also damaging to the @entity1 was a report that an intruder got far into the @entity52 itself after he scaled the mansion 's perimeter fence and sprinted nearly the length of a football field across the lawn and through an unlocked door without being apprehended			1
disgruntled agents and supervisors told the @entity56 that @entity34 discussed making the elite corps that guards the president and his family ' more like @entity89 ' and ' more friendly			1
' @entity2 's source said that this caused instant turmoil among long - serving agents , including those in the @entity95			1
he spoke on condition of anonymity , and said he did n't know who inside the agency had ' sandbagged her ' by leaking damaging information to the press			0
but he said it was likely a series of deep - seated resentments that ender @entity34 's career			2
' as soon as she took over ' 18 months ago , he said , ' the word was that she wanted to make the service softer and less macho			0
and that did n't sit well with anybody			0
' ' even the female agents are constantly drawing on their inner tough - guy			0
anyone who is willing to take a bullet for the president has to be heavy on testosterone , so she really knocked the wind out of us			0
' a congressional panel excoriated @entity34 on tuesday , questioning her leadership of an organization whose lapses put president @entity26 's life in danger @entity128 ( left ) , shown in 2010 as part of president @entity26 's personal protection detail , has come out of retirement to take over the @entity1 on an interim basis until @entity26 appoints @entity34 's successor the @entity56 reported thursday that @entity34 had also rejected a plan to assign about 100 countersurveillance agents to patrol the @entity52 's perimeter , instead cutting that number by one - third			1
she also presided over a reduction in the numbers of uniformed @entity141 who protect the @entity52 compound from the outside			2
and she made the controversial decision to limit the street - level security surrounding this year 's @entity148 - @entity147 , erring on the side of allowing more automobile traffic to flow through the nation 's capital			1
these mistakes , the retired agent said , irked him and his colleagues , including many who were not assigned to the @entity95			0
' this is a job where our loyalty to the office of the president trumps everything else , ' he told @entity2			1
' what we expected from our leadership was loyalty in return , and @entity34 did n't seem to understand that			2
she had n't been in the field for a long time			0
' ' but cutting down the size of the @entity52 perimeter detail was a morale - killer and i think it came back to bite her			1
' a spokeswoman from the @entity177 did not respond to requests for comment about the mood of the union 's members during and after @entity34 's tenure .			2

a former @entity1 agent told @entity2 that rank - and - file thought @entity4 ' was a joke from @entity10 '
@entity34 *enraged* the rank - and - file when she reduced security measures during the @entity148 - @entity147 so traffic would n't be *affected*
@entity1 supervisor said ' she does n't know anything about security planning in a post- 9/11 world '
another said she discussed making the elite corps that guards the president and his family ' more like @entity89 ' and ' more friendly '
she *shrunk* the @entity52 's countersurveillance force and reduced numbers of uniformed agents who guard the mansion 's perimeter
' cutting down the size of the @entity52 perimeter detail was a morale - killer and i think it came back to bite her , ' he said
