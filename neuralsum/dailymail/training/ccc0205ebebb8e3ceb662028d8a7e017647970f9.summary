@entity0 today faces the biggest crisis of his leadership , amid rising panic that his personal unpopularity will cost @entity6 victory at the next election			1
analysis of voter satisfaction ratings over four decades reveal mr @entity0 is down to minus 34			2
it means he is less popular than any prime minister or opposition leader at this point ahead of an election , except @entity16 who led @entity6 to its worst ever defeat			1
@entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 all had higher net satisfaction ratings with @entity25 six months before being hammered at the ballot box			1
analysis of @entity25 polling dating back to 1977 by @entity29 shows how only @entity16 had worse personal satisfaction ratings than @entity0 six months before a general election mr @entity0 has come under growing pressure from his own party to improve his own image and standing with voters , who do not view him as a future prime minister since becoming leader four years ago mr @entity0 has seen a collapse in his public satisfaction ratings			1
a month after he defeated his brother for the leadership , 41 per cent per of voters were satisfied with mr @entity0 with just 19 per cent dissastified , giving a net rating of 19 points			2
in the latest @entity48 survey , published two weeks ago , the figure had slumped to -34 , twice as bad as @entity49 's -17			2
' it 's all just depressing , ' a shadow cabinet minister said			0
' people tell me they ca n't vote @entity6 it means @entity0 becomes pm			1
but it 's my name on the ballot paper , not his			0
' a senior backbencher added : ' people normally grow into the role , but he 's shrunk			1
' the @entity61 have made clear they will present the election campaign as a direct choice between mr @entity49 and mr @entity0 as a future prime minister , which senior @entity6 figures fear most			1
growing numbers liken the panic gripping the @entity69 to the run - up to the 2010 election , when @entity23 's personal unpopularity and poor image was repeatedly raised by voters as a concern			1
but the analysis shows that mr @entity23 's satisfaction ratings stood at -25 six months before he led @entity6 to a thumping defeat in 2010			1
every prime minister and opposition leader since the late 1970s had better net satisfaction ratings than mr @entity0 , expect for mr @entity16 mr @entity0 started off well , but has seen his net satisfaction rating plummet			1
a senior @entity6 mp said : ' people normally grow into the role , but he 's shrunk ' only a quarter of voters say they are satisfied with mr @entity0 as @entity6 leader , with almost two thirds dissatisfied @entity91 leaders @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 all had better ratings than mr @entity0 before they were beaten by @entity93 's @entity6 in 1997 , 2001 and 2005			1
only @entity16 had worse support six months before his defeat to @entity96 in 1983 , but only just - his net satisfaction of -38			1
@entity98 , chief executive of @entity25 , said : ' @entity0 's personal ratings among voters are a serious problem for @entity6 – no - one has ever become prime minister with ratings like these , and without a lead on managing the economy			1
' only @entity16 's ratings in the run up to the 1983 election were worse			1
' on the other hand of course only twice has a government been in power for over two years and increased its share of the vote , and while @entity49 is more popular than @entity0 , the @entity91 remain much less liked than the @entity69 among voters			0
' critics point to mr @entity0 's disastrous party conference speech , which he delivered without notes and forgot to mention the deficit or immigration			1
after being mocked for his difficulties eating a bacon sandwich , mr @entity0 claimed he was not a photo opportunities politician , contrasting his high - minded approach to @entity49 putting style over substance			2
in a speech in july he attempted to present himself as serious and principled compared to mr @entity49 ’s ‘ superficial ’ and image - driven approach			0
the photo opportunity , he said , is ‘ not where my talents lie – as you may have noticed ’			0
he said : ' if you want a politician who thinks that a good photo is the most important thing , then do n’t vote for me			0
but here ’s the thing : i believe that people would quite like somebody to stand up and say there is more to politics than the photo op. and that culture diminishes our politics			0
’ but since then the @entity6 leader has posed wearing a pro-feminism t - shirt and gave a handful of change to a beggar while surrounded by photographers			2
a former cabinet minister told @entity29 said : ' what p * * * es me off is he said he would be about content not style , but it 's all style and spin ... and it 's s * * *			0
' the only thing worse than the idea he wo n't be prime minister is the thought that he might			0
' in july mr @entity0 promised he was not a ' photo opportunity ' politician , but has since been pictured wearing a pro-feminism t - shirt ( right ) and giving a handful of change to a beggar while surrounded by photographers last night mr @entity0 reshuffled his frontbench team , appointing @entity173 as vice-chairman of the general election campaign			2
she said she was going to ' unblock ' the system to make sure the operation was working effectively			0
it follows growing unease about the leader 's office , and its failure to communicate with voters			0
one frontbencher said : ' i told them we need to talk in a way that normal people understand			0
i 'm not sure they understood what i meant			0
' in a fresh blow , the @entity192 , which is traditionally supportive of @entity6 , warns that mr @entity0 's approach is haemorrhaging support on the @entity196 to the @entity197 and the @entity198			1
the magazine says the @entity6 leader appears a product of his ' narrow background ' and demonstrates no understanding of lower middle - class aspiration			2
@entity205 , editor of the @entity192 , one of only two national publications to back mr @entity0 over his brother @entity208 for the @entity6 leadership in 2010 , said he appeared ' very much an old - style @entity210 socialist '			1
' he does n't really understand the lower middle - class or material aspiration , ' he writes			0
' he does n't understand @entity213 or woman			0
politics for him must seem at times like an extended @entity217 seminar : elevated talk about political economy and the good society			0
' he adds : ' @entity0 has a deterministic , @entity222 analysis of our present ill. ' the @entity225 insurgency , @entity227 nationalism , the hollowing out of political parties , @entity231 radicalisation , the loathing and distrust of elites : all are manifestations of a failed economic model			0
who was defeated by his brother for the @entity6 leadership in 2010 , is now ceo of the @entity243			0
last night he hosted the @entity244 in @entity245 , attended by rock singer @entity246 and opera singer @entity247 mr @entity0 also posed for photographs with ballet dancer and actor @entity251 ( left ) and his @entity238 ( right )			2

*pollster* says @entity0 's -34 *%* net satisfaction rating is a ' serious problem '
only @entity16 was worse ahead of @entity6 's 1983 election *drubbing*
@entity23 , @entity22 , @entity21 , @entity20 , @entity19 and @entity18 were all better
@entity261 fears @entity0 's unpopularity will cost @entity6 victory in 2015
two @entity265 call on leader to resign now , according to @entity268 reports
senior labour mp : ' people normally grow into the role , but he 's shrunk '
left - wing @entity192 *labels* him an ' old - style @entity210 socialist '
