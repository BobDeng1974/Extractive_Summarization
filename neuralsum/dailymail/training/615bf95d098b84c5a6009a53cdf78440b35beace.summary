a 24 - year - old @entity0 convert has admitted taking her infant son to live among @entity4 terrorists in the @entity6 city of @entity7 because she believes he will lead a ' better life ' under their brutal regime			1
@entity11 denied that children are unhappy living under the oppressive rule of @entity16 ' religious fanatics and explained that she felt her three - year - old son 's spiritual well - being was better served in the group 's de facto capital , where public crucifixions and beheadings are commonplace			1
@entity23 - who had lived in @entity24 since her teens but was born in @entity26 - said moving to the militant stronghold in @entity6 was in part to shield the young boy from the sex , crime , drugs and alcohol she sees as rampant in her home town @entity35			1
' who says children here are unhappy ? ... he will know @entity40 and live under his rules , ' she said			1
the 24 - year - old @entity0 convert took their child to territory controlled by @entity16 radicals : @entity16 supporters slogans as they carry the group 's flags in front of the provincial government headquarters in @entity57 , @entity58			1
a growing number of people are moving to the region to live under shariah law @entity11 's journey to radical @entity64 was born of loneliness and resentment			1
born @entity67 , she converted to @entity64 after marrying @entity43 six years ago			0
the pair met in @entity24 when @entity67 , still a teenager , came to @entity35 from with her mother to buy textiles			2
@entity11 had travelled from former @entity71 republic @entity26 , where 80 per cent of the population are @entity0 and @entity73 orthodoxy is the minority religion			1
her story , told to @entity76 in a series of @entity79 messages , illustrates how the vast swaths of territory under the control of @entity16 in @entity6 and @entity58 have become home to thousands of devout @entity0 families , despite the extreme violence so often found there			1
many of these highly religious families are @entity24 and have made their way to @entity7 with young children in tow in order to live among murderers and terrorists			1
' the children of that country see all this and become either murderers or delinquents or homosexuals or thieves , ' @entity23 wrote , attempting to justify moving her young son into @entity16 ' brutal realm			1
@entity16 , the self - styled caliphate straddling @entity58 and @entity6 , appears eager to attract families			1
one recent promotional video shows a montage of @entity0 fighters from around the world cuddling their children in @entity7 against the backdrop of an amusement park where children run and play			1
mr @entity43 holds up a picture of the son he 's not seen since july , when his ex-wife took him over the border to @entity16 - controlled @entity118 where she now lives a man , identified in the footage as an @entity121 named @entity122 , holds an infant who has a toy machine gun strapped to his back			1
' look at all the little children , ' @entity122 says			2
' they 're having fun			0
' it may promote itself as a family - friendly place , but @entity16 ' bloody campaign for control of @entity6 and @entity58 has uprooted hundreds of thousands of people in a wave of destruction involving brutal punishments and acts of cultural vandalism			1
none of that matters to @entity11			2
' the blood and goods of infidels are halal , ' she said - meaning she believes that @entity64 sanctions the killing of non-muslims			2
@entity11 's story has already made waves in @entity24 , where her disappearance became front - page news after her ex-husband - a 44 - year - old car salesman named @entity43 - went to the press in an effort to find their child			1
many others in @entity24 have carted away family to @entity16 territory under far less public scrutiny and in much greater numbers			1
in one incident earlier this month , more than 50 families from various parts of @entity24 slipped across the border to live under @entity16 , according to opposition legislator @entity165			1
@entity165 's figure appears high , but his account is backed by a villager from @entity169 , in central @entity24 , who told @entity76 that his son and his daughter - in - law are among the massive group			1
the villager spoke on condition of anonymity , saying he is terrified of reprisals			0
the movement of foreign fighters to the @entity4 group - largely consisting of alienated , angry or simply war - hungry young @entity0 - has been covered extensively			1
the arrival of entire families , many but not all of them @entity24 , has received less attention			2
' it 's about fundamentalism , ' said @entity186 , a professor of international relations at @entity35 's @entity185			2
the @entity4 group 's uncompromising interpretation of @entity64 promises parents the opportunity to raise their children free from any secular influence			2
' it 's a confined and trustable environment for living out your religion , ' @entity186 said			2
' it kind of becomes a false heaven			0
' ' before we were married ' : @entity43 shows a picture of him and his wife in happier times , before the birth of their son and before her increasing interest in radical @entity64 @entity43 , speaking from his lawyer 's office in @entity35 , said the relationship worked at first			2
' before we were married we were swimming in the sea , in the pool , and in the evening we would sit down and eat fish and drink wine			0
that 's how it was , ' he said , holding a photograph of the two of them , both looking radiant in a well - manicured garden			2
' but after the kid was born , little by little she started interpreting @entity64 in her own way			0
' @entity43 said his wife became increasingly devout , covering her hair and praying frequently , often needling him to join in			0
' thank @entity40 , i 'm a @entity0 , ' he said			2
' but i 'm not the kind of person who can pray five times a day			0
' asked why she became engrossed in religion , @entity43 acknowledged that his wife was lonely			0
but in @entity79 messages to the @entity76 , many typed out on a smartphone , @entity11 accused her husband of treating her ' like a slave			1
' she alleged that @entity43 pressured her to abort their child and said she felt isolated in @entity35			0
' i had no friends , ' she said			0
' i was constantly belittled by him and his family			0
i was nobody in their eyes			0
' these photos are all @entity43 has left of his son and ex-wife after she took the boy away to @entity16 - controled territory @entity43 acknowledged initially asking his wife to terminate her pregnancy , saying it was too early in the marriage to have children			1
but when she insisted on carrying the pregnancy to term , @entity43 said he accepted her decision and loved the boy			0
meanwhile @entity43 's wife was finding the companionship she yearned for online , chatting with jihadists and filling her @entity79 page with religious exhortations and attacks on gays			0
in june , she and @entity43 divorced			0
the next month , a day before her ex-husband was due to pick up their son for vacation , she left with the boy for @entity273 , a @entity24 town near the @entity6 border			1
@entity43 , who had been eavesdropping on her social media activity , alerted the authorities , but the pair still managed to slip across the border it is n't clear how many families have followed @entity11 's path , although anecdotal evidence suggests a powerful flow from @entity24 into @entity6			1
in @entity288 , a industrial town of 42,000 halfway between @entity35 and the port city of @entity290 , at least four people - including a pair of brothers - recently left for @entity6 , three local officials said			0
the officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to talk to the media , said that dozens of people from surrounding towns were believed to have left as well			0
@entity43 says he is in touch with other families in similar circumstances			0
he cited one case in the @entity24 capital , @entity302 , where 15 members of the same extended family had left for @entity6 ' as if they 're going on vacation			2
' even with @entity121 bombs now falling on @entity118 , @entity11 says she has no second thoughts			2
' i only fear @entity40 , ' she wrote			0
for @entity43 , who says he has n't seen his son since his ex-wife took the boy , her decision is a selfish form of fanaticism			0
' if you want to die , you can do so , ' he said			0
' but you do n't have the right to bring the kid with you ... no one can give you this right			0
' @entity11 's @entity79 account has now disappeared			1
her messages to the @entity76 were also removed , replaced with a message from @entity79 saying they were ' identified as abusive or marked as spam			0
' @entity79 did not immediately return a message seeking comment .			0
