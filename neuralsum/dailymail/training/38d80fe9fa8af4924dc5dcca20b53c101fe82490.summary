a war of words has begun between a top @entity3 news station and @entity4 with the networks trading insults after an @entity7 correspondent insulted one of @entity3 ’s @entity10 monuments and then a @entity3 anchor shot back by suggesting that two of the soldiers in the @entity7 @entity15 monument were simulating gay sex			1
@entity4 caused a firestorm when it included a war monument in @entity19 , a city in the former @entity22 republic of @entity23 , in an article on the ' world 's ugliest monuments ' published last month			1
' on february 6 , @entity4 edited the story on its website and added a note apologizing for the offense it caused in @entity23 and @entity3			2
the county ’s role in the second @entity52 is still one of the nation 's proudest moments so it comes as little surprise that any slights against the effort are taken extremely personally			0
the day after the @entity4 story was published , the @entity59 took the unusual step of summoning @entity4 's @entity63 correspondent for an official reprimand			1
the journalist was told that ' mocking the memory of @entity22 soldiers who gave their lives for the victory over fascism can not be justified or forgiven , ' the ministry said in a statement on its website			2
the @entity7 network then withdrew the article entirely			0
striking back : a news anchor on @entity3 state television said that the @entity77 in the @entity7 @entity15 memorial were gay because of the way they are depicted inspiration : the memorial is based off the famous photograph of @entity77 raising the flag on @entity85 ' @entity4 apologizes for the unintended offense caused by an article from a contributor that was intended to be a humorous look at monumental architecture worldwide , ' it said in a statement			1
taking it personally : this @entity94 protestor demonstrated how ht issue is hurting @entity3 's feelings ' we recognize that the @entity98 carries deep and significant symbolism in honoring the soldiers who gave their lives defending their nation			2
' that was n't enough , however , as a controversial news anchor on @entity106 state television then went after @entity4 during his weekly show , which aired sunday night following the team skating competition in @entity111 that gave @entity3 its first gold medal of the @entity113			1
as pictures of the monumental @entity19 sculpture filled the screen , @entity114 told viewers how the @entity7 had ridiculed the @entity22 soldier depicted in the war memorial			1
he then showed a picture of the @entity123 sculpture shot from behind , so that the @entity77 raising the flag during the @entity15 were bent over one another			0
' it 's easy to mock , ' @entity114 said with his trademark smirk			0
' a fevered subconscious could ascribe just about anything to it			0
take a closer look : a very modern theme , is it not ? ' @entity114 has often led the attack on @entity7 , gays or other groups that top the @entity138 agenda			0
as international criticism over a @entity3 law banning gay ' propaganda ' reached a fever pitch last year , he said homosexuals ' hearts should be buried or burned			2
in december , @entity145 appointed @entity114 the new head of the state news agency @entity147 , which after serving as the host agency during the @entity149 will be restructured .			0

@entity4 included a @entity22 *-* era wwii memorial on a list of the world 's ugliest monuments , saying that the soldier looks ' constipated '
@entity3 foreign minister issued an official reprimand to @entity4 's @entity63 correspondent and the list was eventually taken down from their website
news anchor on @entity3 state television then suggested that the *marines* in the @entity7 @entity15 memorial were gay because of their stance
