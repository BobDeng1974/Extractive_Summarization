' i understood @entity1 to be a reasonably happy person but i was aware of difficulties with both his mother and mother - in - law , who appeared to be particularly demanding			1

' mr @entity187 added : ' @entity1 was constantly using the phrase my loving little family and was clearly desiring to be a family man but felt he was not a good husband , father or son and this was reflected in a great reduction of his own self - esteem over this period			1
