by @entity0 published : 07:42 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 08:05 est , 11 july 2013 pressure : child protection experts warn young girls are being persuaded to send explicit images of themselves to boys girls as young as 11 are sending out explicit photos of themselves through text messages and social networking sites - with schools dealing with the problem ' on a daily basis '			1
the practice of ' sexting ' is getting more common with younger children involved every year , child protection experts have warned			1
increasing numbers of girls are being persuaded to send boys explicit images of themselves - but the photographs can often be used to blackmail them through sharing via @entity22 and @entity24 messaging			1
a study by the @entity26 reported up to 40 per cent of young people had been involved in sexting , mainly under pressure from other schoolchildren			2
the latest warnings came at a conference held in @entity33 by the @entity34 which brought together teachers , social workers and police to tackle the problem			1
the conference heard how many schools are now installing forensic software to intercept explicit messages exchanged by pupils on school computers			1
experts believe increasingly sexualised media and video games could be to blame - with one delegate telling how a boy of just seven said he liked playing @entity49 ' because you get to rape people '			1
it is also thought many parents are unaware of what sexting is or how explicit the messages have become			2
@entity57 , assistant headteacher at @entity58 in @entity59 , said : ' sexting is something i deal with on a regular basis - it 's quite prevalent in schools now , a daily problem			1
' ' we have seen examples of it in children of 11 or 12 but generally it is in students from 14 onwards			2
a lot of it is where a teenage couple 's relationship has broken down and the girl is blackmailed with the threat that the photos she sent when they were together will be shown to everyone			2
distress : many schoolchildren are unaware that any images they text can be published online ( posed by model ) ' however , we 're also starting to see sexually violent messages specifically targeting girls of ethnic minorities			2
a child protection unit in @entity33 says it is currently dealing with 80 cases of sexual exploitation - many involving girls being groomed to share explicit images of themselves			0
' we deal with the problem head on , talking to pupils concerned , their parents and if necessary involving the school police officer			1
' making or sharing a sexually explicit image of someone under 18 is illegal - meaning teenagers who take photos of themselves and those who share them are both breaking the law			0
many teenagers are also unaware that an image they text to someone can be shared and reproduced online , remaining on the internet forever			0
june @entity107 , a social worker at the @entity108 based at @entity110 police station , said : ' two years ago , the referrals coming in to us were for children around 16 years old - now they are 12 or 13 , and that 's a major concern			0
' humiliation : often the pictures end up being used to blackmail young girls or as a way of shaming them in front of their peers ' a lot of the time we find they have links to older teenagers , but it can also be young people of the same age sexually exploiting each other			0
' ' that 's a very difficult area for us - in some cases legal action can be necessary but we do not want to criminalise children so it has to be looked at on a case - by - case basis			0
we 've had young people referred to us who do n't realise the risks they are taking - in extreme cases we 've had to place them in secure accommodation for their own protection			0
' 16 - year - old @entity144 told the @entity34 conference she was shocked by how young children have started sexting each other - and has seen first - hand the damage it can do			1
@entity144 said : ' sexting is quite common now and people are doing things younger and younger			0
' each year it starts earlier and earlier - there are 12 - year - olds doing sexual stuff now , it shocks me			1
' i know a girl from my area who sent explicit pictures and voice note messages - she thought she trusted that person			0
' but they got published all over @entity22 and via @entity166 , he showed those pictures to everyone			0

@entity34 heard ' each year it starts earlier and earlier '
experts believe sexualised media and video games may be to blame
one teacher said it has become ' a daily problem ' in school
