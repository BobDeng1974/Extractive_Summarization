it 's hard to imagine @entity1 not running for president again – and easy to imagine the result of such a decision : political chaos			0
' it would be shocking , ' says @entity7 , a @entity8 strategist who is advising sen. @entity9 , a @entity11 @entity10 who is considering a presidential campaign himself			2
early polling shows @entity15 in a dominant position but at least ten other @entity8 stand ready if she declines to accept her brass ring - in - waiting			1
outside groups have been promoting her candidacy for more than a year			0
all that has left the potential field frozen in place and locked down financial donors , endorsements and connections around the country			0
but what if @entity15 decided against another campaign ? those considered long - shots would become instant contenders and others planning to skip the race would give it a new look			1
some whose political fortunes and plans for 2016 could change if @entity15 decides to pass on the race : @entity61 in any other year , the sitting vice president would have an inside track to the nomination			1
but @entity15 's dominant standing within the party has marginalized @entity61 in early 2016 discussion			1
in a @entity15 - free campaign , the veteran of runs for president in 1988 and 2008 would be an early front - runner @entity73 the @entity77 senator is a favorite of liberal activists , some of whom are trying to ' draft ' her into running for president – even though she has repeatedly said she is not			1
@entity83 's populist economic approach and calls to rein in @entity84 resonate with many @entity8 disappointed by the midterm elections and the gap between the wealthy and the poor			2
if @entity15 decides not to run , @entity83 is sure to face pressure to fill the void			2
@entity90 the outgoing @entity92 governor has been a workhorse surrogate for fellow @entity8 , trying to build a network of financial donors – only to be effectively frozen by @entity15			1
even without @entity15 in the field , the @entity97 ' defeat of his hand - picked successor in @entity92 – and sagging poll ratings at the end of his term – would complicate his campaign			1
@entity104 the former @entity106 senator would bring a bipartisan record to the campaign : he served as president @entity110 's navy secretary			1
he is an accomplished author and decorated veteran , still carrying shrapnel from his service in the @entity114			0
he is independent and at times unpredictable , and his foreign policy outlook and outsider status could shake up the primary with or without @entity15			2
first team : liberals ' liberal @entity73 ( left ) would take @entity1 's default slot as the leading female candidate if she does n't run , and @entity61 ( right ) would gain momentum as an incumbent vice president the governors : @entity92 's former gov. @entity90 ( left ) , @entity128 's current gov. @entity125 ( center ) and @entity106 's former gov. @entity127 could provide executive experience in a crowded field @entity9 few democrats expect the independent senator from @entity11 to make much of an impact if he runs against @entity15 , but that has not stopped @entity9 from courting college students and liberals in @entity137 and @entity138			1
he has maintained a large email distribution list , giving him a way of reaching activists , but is still more likely to shape the debate than compete for delegates no matter what @entity15 does			1
@entity125 when @entity128 gov. @entity146 declined to seek the @entity34 in 1991 after a lengthy deliberation , the vacuum helped a relatively unknown @entity149 governor named @entity15			2
if @entity1 decides not to run , it could give his son , @entity128 gov. @entity125 , an opening to jump into a race he does not plan to contest			0
the second - term governor has built a record of accomplishments on marriage equality , gun control and , last month , banned hydraulic fracturing in @entity128 — a move cheered by environmentalists			0
@entity127 the @entity106 senator has big - time credentials : he 's a @entity166 - speaking former @entity165 missionary , @entity168 graduate , former mayor of @entity170 , @entity106 , and the ex-governor of the state			1
@entity127 quickly embraced candidate @entity173 and found himself on the short - list for vice president			1
instead , @entity173 put him in charge of the @entity177 and @entity127 later succeeded @entity104 in the @entity178			2
he has backed the @entity179 for @entity180 , and would get a serious look if @entity15 took a pass			0
year of the woman ? @entity128 sen. @entity184 ( left ) or @entity186 sen. @entity185 ( right ) could swoop in to claim that mantle from @entity1 if she sits out or falters early @entity188 : socialist senator @entity9 ( left ) and former @entity8 chairman @entity189 ( right ) form the left vanguard while former sen. @entity104 ( center ) is a low - charisma outsider with military cred @entity184 the energetic @entity194 holds @entity15 's old @entity178 seat and has been talked up as a potential heir apparent			1
a relative newcomer to the national stage , @entity184 has displayed a strong acumen as a legislator , fundraising moxie , and a down - to - earth sensibility as the constantly juggling mother of two boys			0
she has championed legislation to remove sexual assault cases from the military chain of command and promoted paid family leave for women			0
@entity185 the first woman elected to the @entity178 from @entity186 , @entity185 has made political trips to neighboring @entity137 to help @entity8 candidates and the party , moves that always start talk about the @entity34			0
a former prosecutor , @entity185 has built a reputation in the @entity178 for working across the aisle			0
on the dinner circuit , she displays a folksy sense of humor that helps her connect with @entity8 audiences			0
@entity189 the former @entity11 governor and contender for the party 's 2004 presidential nomination has backed @entity15 , giving the former secretary of state an advocate among the party 's liberal wing			2
as @entity177 chairman , @entity189 helped modernize the party 's technological capabilities , laying the ground work for @entity173 's successful grassroots campaign in 2008			0
he 's unlikely to leave the private sector , but may be swayed if @entity15 decided to take a pass on another campaign .			0

@entity73 would emerge as the new standard - *bearer* for activists trying to elect the first female @entity243 president
@entity61 could look like less of an *afterthought* after eight years as vice president
@entity104 was secretary of the navy under president @entity110 and could appeal to *war* - *hawkish* centrist @entity8
other long - shots , *including* an avowed socialist and a former @entity165 missionary , could *reclaim* some of the *oxygen* @entity15 has sucked out of the @entity8 ' room
