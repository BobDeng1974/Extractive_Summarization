by @entity0 the sun was shining and the ensembles colourful , as racegoers , joined by a glamorous @entity4 , arrived for @entity5 at the @entity7 race meeting in @entity8 today			1
but for once , all eyes were n't on the brightly dressed ladies - all thanks to an unexpected appearance from @entity14 star @entity13 who arrived with @entity16 , @entity17 , and his wife , @entity18			1
@entity4 , meanwhile , slipped into the racecourse with a minimum of fuss , although not before impressing fashion fans with her chic cream dress and matching cocktail hat , and was later seen enjoying a chat with the actor from the comfort of a box			1
earlier this month , @entity4 took to the field at the @entity76 near @entity77 and also enjoyed a successful day at the @entity78 in @entity79 in late june			0
but successful though most of her outings have been , it is the @entity57 that are at the front of her mind , particularly as @entity85 selectors for @entity86 will be in the crowd			0
competing alongside @entity4 in @entity74 will be the rest of the current @entity85 , among them world number one @entity91 and fellow @entity31 medallist @entity92			0
despite the prospect of an imminent brush with the selectors , @entity4 looked relaxed and ready to enjoy a day 's racing which kicked off with the @entity63 , which was won by three - year - old colt @entity96			1
enjoying himself : @entity13 certainly appeared impressed with his experiences of the quintessentially @entity101 event and was seen laughing with lord march hello ladies : clearly on charming form , @entity13 also proved a hit with the colourfully dressed ladies who were sharing his box at @entity7 in @entity8 you win some ... @entity109 was thrilled when she managed to back a winner but @entity13 looked less than impressed with his horse 's performance nice work : @entity13 presents model @entity114 with @entity116 - a @entity7 tradition that sees female celebrity jockeys race down the course @entity14 royalty : racegoers were surprised to see @entity13 who arrived with @entity16 , @entity17 and his wife , @entity18 big welcome ! despite being caught on the hop , the band of the @entity125 managed to strike up a ditty in @entity13 's honour - much to his delight getting involved : beautifully dressed racegoers could n't resist the chance of a selfie with a @entity14 icon and @entity13 happily obliged @entity134 : @entity65 , tv presenter and rumoured former flame of @entity137 ( left ) , and jeweller @entity138 and his wife @entity139 ( right ) were at @entity7 the line up : among the celebrity jockeys lining up for the @entity116 were @entity92 ( third from right ) and eventual winner , model @entity114 ( far right ) @entity146 quality : @entity109 looked wonderful in a navy blue jumpsuit and straw hat while presenter @entity66 was pretty in a yellow tea dress winning : @entity116 winner @entity114 celebrates with her boyfriend , the countryside campaigner and rock star offspring , @entity153 oh no ! @entity154 , daughter of @entity155 , looks grim as she watches the races with @entity157 , lord @entity158 - the son and heir of @entity17 although neither @entity13 nor @entity4 managed to back him , tv star @entity109 , who was chic in a demure navy blue jumpsuit , was left celebrating her first win of the day			1
also left less than impressed was the @entity163 , whose @entity164 winning filly estimate was left to bring up the rear in the @entity167 - much to her jockey @entity168 's distress			1
estimate , who was recently caught up in a doping scandal that led to her being accidentally fed morphine - tainted feed , was left far behind the eventual winner , sheikh @entity178 's horse @entity176			0
off the course , things hotted up in the style stakes too , with racegoers plumping for demure shift dresses and eye - catching hats of the type that would n't look out of place at @entity187			1
although it does n't quite hit the sartorial heights of the @entity190 meet , @entity7 is catching up in the fashion stakes as more and more racegoers take the opportunity to dress up for the occasion			0
like @entity187 , @entity7 operates a strict dress code that outlaws jeans and shorts and insists that guests keep their shoulders covered and eschew fancy dress			1
instead , the style guide suggests ' jackets and either ties , cravats or polo neck sweaters ' for gentlemen and ' smart casual ' for ladies , adding that ' due to the terrain and areas of decking at @entity7 , flat shoes are recommended '			2
good look : @entity214 was pretty in a tropical hibiscus print frock ( left ) while fellow racing fans @entity217 and @entity218 chose simple ensembles girls in pearls : @entity223 's @entity222 , model @entity224 , @entity65 , stylist @entity225 and @entity223 designer @entity226 at @entity7 elegant : @entity228 was pretty in a taupe and cream ensemble ( left ) while fellow racing fan @entity231 was elegant in ice blue and white elegant ensembles : one lady arrived wearing a striking tropical themed ensemble , while another plumped for a dramatically simple dress and a wonderful feathered hat colourful : ladies wearing beautiful hats festooned with delicate orchids ( left ) and a lotus flower made from feathers ( right ) beam as they enjoy their day out fashionable : a racing fan shows off her chic fuchsia fedora teamed with a simple white dress ( left ) while racegoer @entity248 demonstrates how to do summer florals pretty : delicate shades of nude and cream proved especially popular with racegoers , who added interest using crystal and feather details @entity258 touches : a group of racegoers put the finishing touches to their ensembles , with delicate floral corsages proving particularly popular floor sweeping : several racegoers plumped for unusually long gowns , including one that looked like a wedding dress ( left ) , while others picked flowing and summery while @entity271 is famous for pearls and fur , and @entity278 for its colourfully dressed fillies in fake tan and skyscraper heels , @entity7 's trademark is low key luxury - and flat shoes			1
delicate bejewelled sandals are the most popular with racegoers , as are @entity283 ballet pumps and in the case of some hardened souls , comfortable loafers and deck shoes			0
nevertheless , the meeting is n't short of glamour with plenty of the big , bold , be-plumed hats of the sort seen at @entity190 's @entity187 and neat , nipped - in shift dresses reigning supreme in the paddock			0
as at @entity187 , racegoers have a strict dress code to contend with which insists on smart - casual in all areas and outlaws bare shoulders and any sort of fancy dress			2
' @entity7 is famous for being a stylish yet relaxed occasion , ' continues the style guide , ' and gentlemen are required to wear jackets and either ties , cravats or polo neck sweaters in the @entity67			2
' linen suits and @entity311 are traditionally worn by gentlemen			0
jeans and shorts are not permitted in the @entity67			0
in other enclosures dress is smart casual			0
' @entity318 shoulder tops and fancy dress are not allowed in any enclosure			2
due to the terrain and areas of decking at @entity7 flat shoes are recommended			0
' wonderful time : a group of racegoers , resplendent in summery floral print flocks , appear to be having a wonderful time as they enjoy their day at @entity7 come on ! racegoers hold their hands up as the front runners in the @entity63 thunder towards the line on @entity5 at @entity7 glamorous : a group of racegoers in striking hats , including one fabulous peacock number , enjoy a glass of champagne in the sunshine on @entity5 pretty : a pair of elegantly dressed ladies in beautifully large nude straw hats and , in one case , a pretty butterfly print pashmina , enjoy their day out ready for action : three beautifully dressed racegoers enjoy the gorgeous @entity8 sunshine while studying their racecards ahead of the opening race smart : a trio of racegoers dressed in their best check the form ahead of the opening race on @entity5 at @entity7 - the @entity63 big arrival : a group of ladies dressed in pretty florals and elegant nude and cream dresses make their way into the @entity7 in @entity8 this morning busy day : stylishly dressed racegoers crowded around the bookmaker 's stands as the racing action hotted up on @entity5 at @entity7 hurrah ! racegoers are overcome with excitement as @entity176 , a horse owned by @entity178 of @entity370 , thunders home which one shall we back ? beautifully dressed racegoers consult the form as the runners and riders are walked through the parade ring at @entity7 unhappy : the @entity163 's jockey @entity168 was comforted by trainer sir @entity378 after @entity379 trailed in in last place in the @entity167 it 's all gone wrong : estimate trails home in last place on her return following a doping scandal			1
@entity176 , who belongs to @entity370 's @entity178 , won cooling off : one of the runners gets a welcome bath following his race on a scorching @entity5 at @entity7 in @entity8 spectacular : it was a quintessential @entity393 summer day out at @entity7 today as colourful racegoers bathed in sunshine backdropped by the @entity396			2

@entity4 was elegant in a chic cream dress and an *elaborately* decorated *fascinator* for her day out
racing fans arriving for @entity5 got a surprise when @entity14 royalty @entity13 arrived to see the action
he was joined by @entity16 , @entity17 and happily posed for selfies with fans
ladies pulled out all the stops in a bid to triumph in the style stakes with huge hats proving especially popular
@entity7 has a style guide to rival @entity187 's and bans all forms of fancy dress , shorts and shoulder - baring tops
today 's racing *highlights* include the @entity422 , the @entity63 and the @entity423
unfortunately for the @entity163 , her @entity164 winning horse estimate came last in the @entity167
