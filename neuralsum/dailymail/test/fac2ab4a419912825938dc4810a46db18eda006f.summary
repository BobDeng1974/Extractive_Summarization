' because i have always been single , i have a lot of time in my hands			0
the idea of constructing an @entity2 armour then came to mind			0
' i love the movie			0
even my brother , now in year 6 , loves it			2
my initial idea was to make one for my little brother			2
' he was driven to start his research when his younger brother begged him to build one after they watched the latest installment of the series in the cinema last year			1
construction was harder than @entity4 expected			2
he started looking for a blueprint for the armour last autumn			0
@entity4 spent six months painstakingly researching and building the replica to the move 's measurements to cut the cost , @entity4 used plastic instead of metal which he bought for just 5 yuan ( 60p ) per square metre he said : ' i got all my information from the internet			1

@entity4 bought 20 square metres of plastic in total which he cut them into 13 parts , including the helmet , mask , chest and limb protectors oversight : even his nephew can only sit down when wearing it because his legs are too short for the suit he then stuck them together and coated them with metallic red and gold paint			1
he even installed led lights in the eyes and hands to give a truly authentic feel			0
but he says the electromagnet in @entity2 's chest is still a work in progress			0
frustratingly , @entity4 says he ca n't fit into it himself because he is ' too chubby ' so he asked his nephew to act as his model			2
but even his nephew can only sit down when wearing it because his legs are not long enough for the suit			2
his younger brother also could n't wait to try on the helmet and showed it off to his friends , saying : ' this is so cool ! '			1
