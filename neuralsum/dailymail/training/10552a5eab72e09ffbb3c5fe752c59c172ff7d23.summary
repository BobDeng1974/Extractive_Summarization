by @entity0 @entity2 's half - brother @entity1 lived in a terrace house in @entity4 before the @entity5 , newly - uncovered documents suggest - but the home was later flattened by a @entity10 @entity9 bomb			1
a copy of the 1911 census shows an ' @entity13 ' - widely believed to the dictator 's older half - sibling - and his wife @entity14 , who was known as @entity17 , were residents of the city			1
ironically , considering his infamous half - brother 's @entity21 policies , @entity1 lists his job as a ' chef waiter ' in a @entity26 cafe - which was a @entity27 company			1
@entity28 , the half - brother of @entity21 leader @entity2 , and his wife , @entity14 ( pictured in later life ) , are believed to have lived in @entity4 before the @entity5 an ' @entity13 ' ( number 4 on list ) , believed to be @entity1 , and his wife ' @entity34 ' ( number 6 ) are recorded as living in @entity36 in the city @entity2 was said to have had a strained relationship with his half - brother , although there are reports that he may have visited @entity42 in @entity4 before the @entity5 the property they were living in , at @entity36 , was later destroyed during a @entity10 air raid on @entity4 in 1942 and to this day is still wasteland			1
the fascinating document , uncovered by genealogy website findmypast.co.uk , shows the couple and their son @entity49 living in the property just years before the outbreak of the @entity5			2
the different styles of writing on the sheet suggest that each family member filled in their own details - with @entity1 even mistakenly writing in @entity10 in one entry - recording his son , @entity49 , as his ' sohn '			1
for an unknown reason , he lists himself as being called ' @entity13 ' , rather than his full name , @entity1 , but it is thought that may have been a moniker he was using at the time			0
@entity28 , pictured ( left ) at his home in @entity68 in 1945 and ( right ) in 1937 , was said to be a gambler the document , from 1911 , shows @entity28 living in a house that was later destroyed in a @entity10 bombing raid and working at a @entity27 - owned cafe @entity74 ( left ) , fathered @entity75 by a former partner , who later died , before he married @entity77 - the mother of @entity2 , pictured ( right ) before his rise to power @entity80 - born @entity14 has also used a different name on the document , @entity34 , but the first recording of her name is crossed out on the form and her family name ' @entity87 ' is still clearly visible			1
having been married less than a year , it seems @entity14 was still adjusting to her new married @entity89 had a troubled childhood and is said to have had a rocky relationship with his parents			0
his mother died when he was two and his father married @entity77 - @entity2 's mother			2
it is thought @entity1 had a poor relationship with his younger half - brother and he is not mentioned in @entity2 's book @entity101			1
in 1910 , he met a young woman called @entity103 , at the @entity105 horse show in @entity80			0
@entity1 and @entity14 eloped to @entity106 and married in june 1910			2
in 1914 , he returned to @entity10 without his family and married another woman - he was later prosecuted for bigamy			0
@entity103 and her @entity4 - born son @entity49 in later life , after @entity49 moved to the @entity112 @entity113 , @entity1 and @entity14 's son , pictured being sworn into the @entity112 navy after he fled to @entity112 ahead of the @entity116 the house on @entity4 's @entity36 has since been destroyed by a @entity10 bomb the area where the house once stood is now wasteland			1
@entity4 came under heavy bombing during the @entity116 due to its important dockyards it is believed he was arrested by the @entity124 at the end of the @entity116 , but was released after it emerged he had not joined the @entity128			0
he reportedly later made money from selling autographed photos of his step - brother before his death in @entity68 , @entity10 in 1956			1
his son @entity49 later visited @entity10 but fled to the @entity112 ahead of the @entity116 and , after writing a magazine article called ' why i hate my @entity136 ' , he took the name @entity139 - @entity138 and died in @entity140 in 1987			1
it is said @entity49 later had four sons , three of whom are still believed to be alive and are reportedly living in @entity143 , near @entity140			0
as well as half - brother , @entity1 , @entity2 had a half - sister , @entity145 , and was one of six children born to his father @entity148 and his wife @entity149			1
he had two older brothers , @entity151 and @entity152 , an older sister , @entity154 , and two younger siblings , @entity156 and @entity157			0
in a book called @entity160 of @entity4 , author @entity158 claims the future @entity161 fled to @entity162 from @entity163 , to avoid national service in 1912 and stayed in a flat in @entity166 with his married half - brother @entity1			1
based on the memoirs of @entity103 , the book claims @entity1 was a chronic gambler and , after one win , sent his sister @entity145 some money so she and her husband could visit from @entity163			0
but @entity2 took the money and traveled over instead â€“ to his half - brother 's apparent fury , the book claims			2
his arrival in @entity4 prompted @entity1 to suspect his half - brother was trying to dodge conscription into the @entity183 army			2
@entity14 's book claims @entity1 told her : ' @entity2 has been hiding from the military authorities , consequently from the police , for the last 18 months			2
that 's why he came here to me			0
' @entity14 apparently wrote that in his five months at their @entity166 home , @entity2 was a lazy guest who spent much of his time walking the streets and drinking in the nearby @entity196 pub ( pictured )			0
she wrote : ' @entity2 took everything we did for granted and i 'm sure would have remained indefinitely if he had had the slightest encouragement			0
after the first few weeks he would often come and sit in my cosy little kitchen playing with my two - year - old baby , while i was preparing our meals			0
' he said he was looking for a job , but since he knew only a few words of @entity207 and never left early in the morning , it was always my opinion that he just wandered about @entity4			0
' relations between the two brothers became more strained during the stay and , it is claimed , @entity1 bought his half - brother a ticket back to @entity10 , where he was sent to fight in the @entity5 before embarking on his infamous rise to political power .			2

@entity219 data suggests @entity2 's step - brother @entity1 lived in the city in 1911
he was living with his @entity80 wife , @entity14 , and his *newborn* son , @entity49
their terraced house has since been destroyed by a @entity10 bomb
the record also shows he was working as a waiter in a @entity27 - owned cafe
adds to theory a young @entity2 may have visited the city in 1912
