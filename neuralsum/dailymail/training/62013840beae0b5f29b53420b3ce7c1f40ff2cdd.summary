by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 09:23 est , 26 december 2013 @entity3 : 11:27 est , 26 december 2013 airlines have been trying to squeeze every millimeter of profit out of the expensive industry and now passengers are starting to feel the pinch			0
a comfortable amount of legroom and reclining seats may well become a thing of the past since those are seen as easy revenue areas			2
spirit and @entity19 airlines are just two such companies who are doing whatever they can to make the most of every piece of space that they have			1
packing them in : airlines across the industry - including @entity27 as seen here - are testing different ways to maximize space and turn a profit the @entity32 reports that @entity18 now gives coach passengers the least amount of room , after installing seats that measured to have just 28 inches per person			1
as a result , the airline fits 178 people on their @entity42 planes rather than the general standard of 150			0
one of the ways that they were able to accomplish such a feat was by taking away passengers ability to move their seats back on their own accord			1
instead , @entity18 's coach seats are unmoveable , set permanently to lean three inches back			1
airline representatives are trying to sell this as a benefit for the flyer , however			0
' customers appreciate the fact that there is no longer interference from the seat in front of you moving up and down throughout the flight , ' @entity18 spokeswoman @entity57 told @entity32			2
@entity19 may not have taken away that freedom from its passengers quite yet , but they are limiting their options as they designed new chairs that only allow them to go two inches back rather than the previously - standard three			1
colorful and sleek : @entity19 designed ' slimline ' chairs that use thinner material and a sleeker design to take up less space the ' slim line ' chairs are constructed in a way , using lighter materials and a different design , that helps the company put more seats in the cabin			1
while passengers may not enjoy the change , company higher - ups are seeing the change as that simple design change equates to an additional $ 200million in annual revenue from tickets sold in those extra seats			2
airlines are not the only ones causing problems by shrinking their seats , as part of the blame lies with the passengers themselves			0
the @entity103 reports that over the past 40 years @entity105 ' waistlines have expanded by 2.5 inches and the average person is heavier by more than 20 pounds			0
rather than make the seating space larger to accommodate that physical transformation , airlines are making their offerings smaller .			0

@entity19 created seats using lighter materials and a sleeker design to take up less space
@entity18 made it so that coach passenger seats can not recline *anymore* after being *pre-set* to lean 3 inches back
