by @entity0 published : 11:15 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 01:38 est , 21 june 2013 hardcore porn movies have been filmed at the top of an eight - storey council car park , just yards from the offices of town hall staff			1
police are investigating after @entity8 , in south @entity6 , passed on footage of the explicit film after it was uploaded to an internet porn site last week			2
the 11 - minute professional video was shot in broad daylight and shows sex scenes on the top floor of the @entity16			1
police are investigating after hard core porn films were filmed on top of a @entity8 - owned car park it is understood there are other films in circulation on the internet which have also been shot at the car park opposite the council offices			1
as many as three professional blue movies may have been shot at the council car park in the past few weeks			1
conservative councillor @entity30 , who was told about the films by a ' furious ' resident , said : ' i have seen it and it is about as explicit as it gets			2
it was n't a kiss and a cuddle			0
if you were coming back to your car with your shopping it would be very shocking			0
' the informants showed me the video on their doorstep on a tablet while i was out canvassing			0
they have subsequently contacted me to tell me there are not one but three videos			0
' police are investigating to see if any offences have been committed through the filming and councillors have demanded a review of security at the car park			2
it is illegal to film on council property without its permission			0
the film shows a taxi driving around the borough with a ' client ' in the back seat and the civic offices can clearly be seen in the background			0
in later explicit scenes outside of the car in the car park , which has @entity73 , the @entity69 skyline is clearly visible			1
a ' furious ' resident passed the link to the films shot at the @entity16 car park ( pictured ) to council staff a still image from the film shows a woman in the back of a cab , and a subtitle that reads : ' so maybe i 'll have you first and him after			1

appropriate action will be taken			0
' councillor @entity30 , who has demanded a council investigation into security at the car park , said : ' it is tempting to liken this situation to a " @entity103 " film maybe " @entity104 up the car park " but in reality it is profoundly concerning to see that hard core pornographers feel safe to make a very explicit film in broad daylight at a public car park			1
' he also questioned whether other illegal activities could be taking place there and whether it was safe for people using the car park			2
he said : ' i did not think @entity69 was a favoured porn film location but it seems it is rather the porn capital and @entity16 car park is the film set			2
' a council spokesman said : ' the @entity124 has been made aware of the incident and will make sure their patrols pay attention to the car park			0
' albeit that this incident is not related to any security issues as it involved a taxi driving into our car park during daylight hours , we have undertaken a full safety review of this car park over recent months and have installed a range of security measures including fitting a safety barrier on the top level and installing gates and grilles to prevent out - of - hours access as well as treating walls with anti-climb paint			1
