by @entity0 forget @entity2 's beaches and harbour or @entity5 's pubs and cafes , because the nation 's best place to live and work is our often mocked national capital			0
that 's based on data from one of the world 's most respected economic bodies , the @entity17 , using a ' well - being ' index that compares factors such as the environment , income and health and safety of citizens in 362 regions around the world			1
the territory received three top 10 scores , more than any other region included on the list , for safety , income and civic engagement			1
even its lowest score , for the environment , was still a massive 9.1			0
of all the eight indicators , @entity37 total score was 77.7 out of a possible 80			2
during summer it 's dry and desolate while in the winter months it is one of the coldest places in the country as the political heartland of the country , @entity37 , along with six other of our state 's and territories received top score of 10 for its civic engagement - meaning @entity58 is more in tune with its political system than just about anywhere else			1
the high number of voter engagement , about 95 per cent , was taken from the 2013 federal election and largely reflects the fact that voting in @entity58 is mandatory			0
@entity58 had the highest average voter turnout of any other region based on the previous national election			2
voter turnout is defined as the ratio between the number of voters to the number of persons with voting rights			0
the statistics also confirmed the capital has a higher average income than the 360 regions identified , and it terms of its murder rate - that 's practically non existent			1
@entity37 has the lowest murder rate across @entity58 averaging just one in 100,000 people			0
it 's commonly confused that @entity2 , and not @entity37 , is referred to as @entity58 's capital city			1
despite its knockers , @entity37 seems to be making its place on the world stage			0
a @entity93 article recently told its readers that while it does not compare to the ' glitzier city of @entity2 ' and ' there are no beaches or iconic opera houses ' it does have ' big - sky beauty , breezy civic pride and a decidedly hipster underbelly			0
' the best way to enjoy @entity37 , the @entity93 said , is ' with deep intakes of mountain air and an ear tuned to the calls of sulphur - crested cockatoos and crimson rosellas			0
' unlike most cities , @entity37 was purposefully built as the nation 's capital and the road network is built with an incredibly high number of roundabouts income 10/10 safety 10/10 civic engagement 10/10 health 9.9/10 accessibility to services 9.6/10 @entity119 9.6/10 environment 9.5/10 education 9.1/10 it also recommended going for a bicycle ride which loops one of the capital 's premier attractions , it 's lake			2
but it is n't just any lake , it was named after @entity128 man , @entity127 , who designed the capital built in the centre of @entity5 and @entity2			0
@entity132 's score for education is 5.6 , putting it in the bottom 27 per cent of the @entity17 regions			2
the @entity136 is high on the list , in the top 19 per cent , but when it comes to the country 's natural environment , look no further than @entity132 , @entity141 and @entity142 which all score a perfect 10 out of 10			1
the @entity144 does n't fare quite as well as its neighbouring state 's and territories , scoring just 4.1 for health and 1.4 for @entity149 health score is in the @entity17 's bottom 29 per cent , while its safety score is in the bottom 13 per cent			1
@entity37 and the @entity136 can count itself a lucky place to live , with a higher average income , civic engagement and better safety than some of the 300 regions on the @entity17 list the war museum in @entity37 , it was revealed recently , was @entity58 's number one tourist attraction @entity162 was named in honour of @entity164 , the @entity128 - born architect which designed the capital city from scratch @entity132 , along with @entity142 and @entity141 , scored 10 out of 10 in the environment category the @entity144 does n't fare quite as well as its neighboring states and territories , scoring just 4.1 for health and 1.4 for safety			1

the @entity136 scored a top of 77.7 out of 80 based on eight well - being indicators
it scored 10 - out - of - 10 for @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180
the @entity17 ranked indicators from more than 360 other regions in the world
@entity144 fared @entity58 's worse region on safety and health
