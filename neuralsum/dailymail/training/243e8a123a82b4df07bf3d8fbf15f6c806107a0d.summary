@entity0 are top of the @entity1 but it is @entity3 who have impressed me most so far			1
@entity0 strengthened their squad ; @entity3 had the heart ripped out of theirs			1
as well as selling @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , @entity3 lost their chief executive @entity14 and their manager @entity15			1
but they are once again punching above their weight — they sit fourth in the table before saturday 's tricky trip to @entity19 — and their nightmare summer is fast becoming a distant memory			1
@entity22 jumps for joy after opening the scoring for @entity3 in their 4 - 0 victory over @entity26 @entity3 boss @entity27 looks on during his side 's comfortable victory at @entity30 's saints sit in fourth place after picking up seven points from their opening four games their new signings have impressed me			1
@entity27 is a bit of a journeyman , having been in charge with varying degrees of success at @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 but he is well respected and hugely knowledgeable			1
bringing @entity22 with him from @entity46 looks a masterstroke			1
the @entity51 striker already has four goals this season and is not dissimilar to @entity13 : big and powerful with a good touch			1
behind him @entity55 , brought in from @entity57 , looks a really good player			1
he spots people ’s runs , plays clever through - balls and already has two assists to his name			2
@entity22 and @entity55 ’s form has prompted me to watch a lot of @entity68 football in the past fortnight			1
players seem to get an excellent grounding over there			2
while those two have hit the ground running , @entity11 has yet to play for @entity74 , @entity9 has made a slow start at @entity76 and @entity13 is stuck on the bench			1
@entity55 , brought in from @entity57 , is another from the @entity68 league who has hit form in @entity81 @entity10 ( left ) and @entity9 ( second left ) left @entity3 in the summer along with several others losing @entity84 hurt			1
but two of @entity27 ’s back four in the win over @entity26 — @entity88 and @entity89 — have played in a @entity91 final			2
add @entity92 in goal and you can see why they are flourishing			2
@entity27 ’s team are already having more shots , making more passes and tackles and scoring more goals per game than @entity15 ’s last season			1
so yes , they had the icing ripped off their cake this year but they ’ve just replaced it with a thicker , tastier one			2
another good call by @entity27 was bringing in @entity110 as his assistant			2
i always found him very enthusiastic on @entity81 duty and he is receptive to foreign ideas , having worked with @entity115 at @entity76			0
@entity116 ( second right ) celebrates with team - mates after scoring on saturday there is still an @entity81 core to the squad too , which is crucial			0
@entity122 is thriving at right back and is someone @entity123 might like to look at			0
@entity124 is a huge talent in midfield and @entity127 is still to come back from injury			0
those players and @entity116 will have found it devastating to see so many players leave in the summer but good results will change that			2
so what would be success for @entity3 this season , a campaign in which many tipped them to go down ? if they could match last season ’s eighth - place finish , it would be remarkable ; a minor miracle after selling so many stars			1
but do n’t bet against them doing just that			0
@entity148 i ’d demand more of @entity150 if i was playing with him			0
there are occasions when he does n’t ask enough of himself to get back and defend			0
but a lot of it is about fitness			0
when i was at @entity159 it would take me five or six games to get match fit			0
@entity162 was a bit of a slow starter , too			0
@entity150 was n't at his best on wednesday night as @entity166 lost 1 - 0 to @entity167 i think it ’s the same with @entity150			0
he does n’t look match sharp yet but he ’s not far from it			0
he ’s such a big , powerful player , so he asks a lot of his body when he uses that pace to get up and down the pitch			0
he could have worked harder against @entity167 for the team but keeping him on the pitch will have helped — you build your fitness through the games .			0

@entity3 sit fourth after two wins and a draw so far this season
@entity27 has *reversed* the slide at @entity3 after a summer sale
@entity10 , @entity13 , @entity9 , @entity12 and @entity11 left the club , as well as boss @entity15
they have brought in the likes of @entity22 and @entity55
the pair have starred so far this season for @entity27 's side
