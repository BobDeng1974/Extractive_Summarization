by @entity0 published : 16:53 est , 13 july 2013 updated : 17:09 est , 13 july 2013 the rail minister shamed into giving up his chauffeur - driven car following a public outcry is back in his government limo – after finding the daily commute by train too gruelling			1
@entity8 is risking the wrath of @entity10 by using his £ 80,000 - a - year official car to travel to @entity12			1
the @entity13 revealed earlier this year that mr @entity8 was picked up from his constituency home in @entity16 every morning , driven the 35 miles to his @entity12 office and dropped back home again in the evening			1
the disclosure triggered a furious reaction from commuter groups			0
at it again : rail minister @entity8 , mp arrives for work at the @entity25 in his chauffeur driven car off road : mr @entity8 is pictured on the train journey from @entity30 into @entity31 @entity32 ordered mr @entity8 , who is responsible for ‘ rail strategy ’ and ‘ fares policy ’ , to take the train instead , and the minister joined other commuters from @entity30 station			1
he was pictured looking miserable as he failed to find a seat and stood swaying in the ‘ vestibule ’ area between carriages in a packed train			0
however , at 7am on thursday , mr @entity8 was photographed arriving at the @entity25 in the comfort of the back seat of his @entity46			1
@entity48 sources say the 60 - year - old chain - smoking @entity50 graduate , who is a cousin of rock star @entity51 , now usually stays in @entity31 from monday to thursday and goes back to his constituency only at weekends			2
he is collected from his new base in the capital each morning in his official @entity46 and taken either to his mp ’s office in the @entity56 or his ministerial office in the @entity58			2
controversy : how the @entity13 broke the story that @entity8 was taking an £ 80,000 limo to work back in january contrast : transport minister @entity63 ( centre ) takes the train twice a week on the 120 - mile round trip to his @entity68 constituency , and otherwise travels from his @entity31 home to his office on foot or bus the driver also frequently ferries him between the two offices , which are just one third of a mile apart			1
the @entity46 , one of two pool cars used by the department , costs the taxpayer an annual £ 80,000 , including driver salary , maintenance and other costs			0
the revelation is likely to add to the government ’s embarrassment over mps ’ perks , following a storm of protest over last week ’s proposal that they should receive a bumper pay rise of £ 7,400			0
and , worryingly for mr @entity8 , it comes just days before mr @entity10 prepares to announce a reshuffle of his ministerial ranks			0
bad timing : worryingly for mr @entity8 , it comes just days before @entity10 prepares to announce a reshuffle of his ministerial ranks friends of mr @entity8 say that he found it impossible to work on the trains between @entity30 and @entity31			1
when this newspaper initially disclosed mr @entity8 ’ travel arrangements in january , he argued that he was barred by official rules from working on confidential papers on the train			2
the claim was denied by the @entity107			0
in contrast , fellow transport minister @entity108 usually uses public transport to travel the eight miles to his @entity112 home , while @entity113 under - secretary @entity63 takes the train twice a week on the 120 - mile round trip to his @entity68 constituency , and otherwise travels from his @entity31 home to his office on foot or bus			1
@entity122 mp @entity121 said : ‘ i think it is a shame that the rail minister does n’t seem keen to use the railways			0
he is responsible for the quality of the journey endured by commuters , but will not stoop to join them			0
’ and @entity134 , chairman of commuter group the @entity136 and @entity135 , said : ‘ how can we go to the local mp , who also happens to be the rail minister , about commuting problems if he is not experiencing the same trials and tribulations of the journey into @entity31 as us ? ’ sources close to mr @entity8 said he would not be claiming for the cost of his @entity31 accommodation on expenses , and added that when he travelled between the constituency and @entity12 at weekends , he either drove himself or took the train			1
a @entity58 spokesman said : ‘ @entity8 regularly uses trains , including to and from his constituency			2
as an mp he has always spent nights in @entity31 , particularly when @entity148 is sitting late			0
any night in the capital comes at no expense to the taxpayer			0

@entity8 had given up his *chaffeur* - driven car following a public outcry
he had started taking the train from his @entity30 constituency instead
on thursday he was seen arriving at @entity148 in his @entity46
