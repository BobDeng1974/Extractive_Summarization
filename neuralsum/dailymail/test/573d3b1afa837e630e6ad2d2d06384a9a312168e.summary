i really enjoy celeb watching			2
for me it 's all about watching the parade of stunning women wearing dresses that i would neither be able to fit into nor afford			2
as i get older however , different things draw my attention			0
a clear sign that i 'm firmly settled in middle age may be the utterly sad truth that , i am riveted by the tight jaw lines			1
and on a recent trip to the @entity14 it seemed that i am not the only one			0
i spent my time there scouring the faces of the women - and men - that i met , trying to spot a wobby chin or weak lower cheek			0
as a matter of fact i could n't find a single jowl on anyone			0
these women had expression lines , wrinkles around their eyes and on their forehead when speaking , but chins and jaw lines that were as tight as a girl just sitting her @entity33 's			1
it 's not just about being thin , there 's tightness that on planet earth , as far as i can tell , just should n't naturally be there			0
so just how do they do it ? as a 40 - something woman who is sadly observing a jaw line that appears to be more and more desperate to rendez - vous with my neck each and every day – it has become my latest obsession			1
after some calls to my best insider @entity60 , it seems the new trend in celebrity - ville these days is not about hiding your wrinkles , instead it 's the @entity66 lift , aptly named after the @entity68 queen famous for ( amongst other things ) her very defined jaw line			1
dr @entity71 says she has clients coming in each and every day asking for botox not on their foreheads but designed to firm their jaw line			1
dr @entity71 sees a host of celebrities at her @entity79 clinic and says that ' while the whole world expects it 's wrinkles that age you , it 's actually your face shape that 's making you look older			0
' she has clients coming in each and every day asking for @entity85 not on their foreheads but designed to firm their jaw line			1
here 's why : ' the first thing that our mind assesses when it come to judging the age of the person is shape of their face , ' dr @entity71 says , ' our faces change with time from a triangle ( high cheek bones and defined jaw line ) to a square with a heavy jaw line and double chin			1
the shape of the face is much more important than the lines and folds			0
in fact , according to recent research we universally recognise as younger , a person who is wrinkly but has a youthful face shape			0
thus , traditional botox on the forehead alone does n't improve appearance , but changing the shape of your face and tightening your jaw line , does			1
' getting a @entity116 , or lower face rejuvenation has become a must have in @entity118 right now , and you can understand why			0
@entity120 says the latest anti aging treatment is the @entity66 lift for jowls think about the love scenes			1
how many of us can say with confidence we do n't have double chins when lying down ? i dread to think what mine looks like			0
and these actresses are filmed that way and just as badly – from the side whist talking			0
how i dread those photos showing up on @entity134 ! indeed , for those of us who live our lives ' off camera ' or shall we say with less pressing incentive than our celebrity friends have , there 's still a feeling of wanting to look the way we used to			2
the good news is though , that apart from a lower face lift – which lets be honest plenty of actresses have – for those of us who want to avoid going under the knife there is a lot of other stuff out there we can do			2
indeed , dr @entity71 of @entity156 confirms that there 's a lot that can be done without surgery : you can jab it : access to soft and fat tissue around the jaw line and under the chin can be corrected with up to 3 sessions of @entity167 ( which is a new and improved version of ' flab jab ' ) it works to dissolve fat cells and allows us to pass them out of our bodies when we urinate			1
you can tighten it : loss of skin laxity can be rectified with different skin treatments like @entity180 , @entity181 or laser and loss of volume on the upper face resulting in a lower face drop can be improved with @entity187 or @entity188			0
you can lift it : over active @entity191 muscle on the neck that pulls the corner of the jawline down with every contraction can be relaxed with muscle relaxant injections such as @entity85 which gives an effective lift			1
@entity85 ( muscle relaxing injections ) : @entity66 lift £ 350 ( treatments last 3 - 4 months ) and finally dr @entity71 says that the best innovation over the last couple of years is threads			1
these have been around for a while ( remember @entity206 was snapped with that suspicious scarring that was widely believed to be a thread lift ? ) brand new to the market are @entity211 threads - a @entity213 innovation that is suitable for both lifting and tightening			2
it 's far less invasive than traditional threads ( there is no hook to hook them on ) and there are many sizes and lengths of threads available which allows treatment to every part of the face and even the body			0
as much as they lift they result in an increase of collagen production and line improvement as a bonus			1
( treatments last up to 18 months ) and with all of these treatments , subtlety is what you 're aiming for			0
says dr @entity71 : ' the greatest advantage is that we can improve the lower face , lift it and tighten without adding extra volume ( as seen before with the dreaded ' pillow faces look ' ) which allows us to achieve not only a younger but as well more naturally beautiful facial appearance			2
