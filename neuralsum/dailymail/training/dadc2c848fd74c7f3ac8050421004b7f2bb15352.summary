the government has today revealed the top - ten most common nationalities of foreign - born women who gave birth in @entity5 hospitals in the last year			1
the new record level of births to foreign - born mothers is more than double the proportion of 20 years ago , with women originally from @entity11 topping the list , according to the @entity13			1
other nations represented in the top ten include @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
a total of 184,000 children were born in these circumstances , with almost half of them in @entity26 , which has a foreign - born mother rate of 56.7 per cent , far above the national average of 25.5 per cent			1
international : foreign - born women have children every day in the @entity30 , reaching record levels in 2011 according to official figures , the average hospital birth can cost £ 1,600 , meaning the total cost to the @entity5 of these would have been at least £ 30million			1
some of the women will have been born abroad and settled in the @entity30 but a number will have visited just to use the @entity5			1
boom : health tourism , including maternity care , is believed to be costing the @entity5 around £ 200 million per year so called ‘ health tourism ’ as a whole is thought to cost taxpayers as much as £ 200million a year			2
urgent treatment , such as maternity care , is provided regardless of residence status or ability to pay but hospitals must take reasonable measures to recover debts from overseas patients if they can trace them			0
some trusts are owed tens of millions by foreign patients and have been forced to write - off some of these debts			2
it came as it was also announced that net migration to the @entity30 is still at 216,000 a year , which is still double the government 's 100,000 target			1
this means that means hundreds of thousands more people every year are coming to the @entity30 when compared to numbers who leave			2
meanwhile the number of foreign - born mothers is rising consistently annually , with the figures now double what they were 30 years ago			1
figures compiled by the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) showed that a 25.5 per cent of all children born in 2011 had foreign - born mothers , compared with 25.1 per cent the year before			1
more than 20,000 were from @entity11 , followed by 18,000 from @entity16 , almost 15,000 from @entity17 and and more than 8,000 from @entity18			1
it is the highest proportion of births to @entity71 born mothers since parents ' country of origin was introduced in birth registration in 1969			2
growth : figures revealed today show that the number of foreign mothers giving birth in @entity81 and @entity82 has reached record levels arrivals : official statistics show net migration is down in @entity89 , east @entity26 , more than three quarters of new mums were born outside the @entity30 but choose to give birth here			1
the @entity13 found that a slight rise of 0.1 per cent in the overall number of newborn children compared with 2010 was entirely due to foreign - born mothers			1
women born in the @entity30 had 1,957 fewer babies in 2011 compared with the previous year , in a reversal of rising numbers of births to @entity30 - born women since 2002			1
meanwhile mothers born outside the @entity30 had 2,702 more babies , in line with a trend since 1995 for the number of births to women who came to the @entity30 from abroad to rise year - on - year			1
the @entity13 said : ' this is the highest proportion of births to mothers born outside the @entity30 since the collection of parents ' country of birth was introduced at birth registration in 1969			1
' this proportion has increased every year since 1990 , when it was just under 12 per cent , with a marked rise over the last decade			0
in 2001 the proportion of births to @entity71 born mothers was 16.5 per cent			2
' it added : ' the slight fall in the number of births to @entity30 born women is a reversal of the previous trend of rising numbers of births to @entity30 women since 2002			2
in contrast , the number of births to women born outside the @entity30 has risen every year since 1995			2
' dr @entity132 , director of the @entity133 at the @entity134 , said the estimated figures were based on the @entity136 ( @entity136 ) and margins of error meant they could be 35,000 higher or lower than stated			0
regions : the highest number of births last year involved mothers from the @entity143 and @entity144 followed by the @entity145 so while net migration was put at 216,000 for last year , this was the central estimate for the figure which could range from 181,000 to 251,000 , meaning that the apparent drop is not statistically significant			1
' there is a constant desire among policy makers in all parties , the press and other interest groups in having ' hard ' facts and specific numbers about migration , but the reality is that sometimes these are simply not available , ' dr @entity132 said			0
' the uncertainty around the official migration estimates means that the figures need to be used and interpreted with great care			0
' @entity19 - born @entity166 , 33 , right , travelled to @entity30 to give birth to quins at a cost of up to £ 200,000 to @entity30 taxpayers			1
the wife of a wealthy businessman had two boys and three girls by caesarean section in april last year and was in @entity176 , @entity26 , for almost two weeks			0
mrs @entity177 , from @entity178 , who had been taking a fertility drug , said at the time : ‘ i had already had miscarriages and could n’t bear the stress another pregnancy would cause			0
so i decided to visit my family in @entity26			0
‘ i thought i would stand a much better chance of avoiding another miscarriage in a calmer place with friends and family			0
’ mrs @entity177 claimed her husband left her and returned to @entity19 after discovering she had given birth to five babies			0
she was given a visa to stay in @entity30 which runs out in december of this year			0
long - term immigration fell slightly to 566,000 from 591,000 , similar to the level it has been at since 2004 , while emigration rose slightly from 339,000 to 350,000			0
study was the most common reason for those coming to @entity30 , with figures showing 232,000 came last year , similar to the 238,000 in the year to december 2010			2
but the number of visas issued for the purpose of study , including student visitors , were down a fifth in the 12 months to june , the @entity13 figures showed			0
there were 282,833 visas issued for study , a fall of 21 per cent compared with the previous 12 months			0
sir @entity214 of @entity215 said : ' this is an astonishing fact , just slipped out by the @entity13			0
' it throws a new light on the huge impact of mass immigration on our society and on our future			0
' the @entity224 told @entity225 that the statistics show their measures are working			0
immigration minister @entity228 said : ' we are now starting to see the real difference our tough policies are making , with an overall fall in net migration and the number of visas issued at its lowest since 2005			1
' at the same time , there are encouraging signs that we continue to attract the brightest and best and to support tourism in the @entity30			0
' we will continue to work hard to ensure that net migration is reduced from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands by the end of this @entity242			2
' we are doing this by improving the selectivity of our immigration system and increasing enforcement activity to prevent people coming into the @entity30 illegally and removing those with no right to be here			0
