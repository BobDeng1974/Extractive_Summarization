but now it appears that llamas have become the latest recession - busting weapon in the fight against countryside crime			1
the aggressive south @entity11 pack animals have long been kept with goats and sheep to guard against predators , but now farmers in the @entity16 are employing them to deter crooks			2
instinctively alert and aware : @entity18 have become the latest recession - busting anti-crime measure to be employed by @entity16 farmers a survey by the insurance company @entity23 has found they are among some of the more unusual improvised security measures used by its members to keep their valuable property safe			1
thefts cost farmers in the @entity16 52.7million last year , an annual rise of six per cent , the company has estimated			2
other improvised methods of protecting farm equipment include keeping noisy flocks of geese to alert homeowners of intruders and storing expensive quad bikes in a pen behind a @entity43 bull			0
but llamas are the most novel means of security the company has identified			0
the animals , which are of the same genetic family as the camel , have long been used by farmers in the @entity52 to defend livestock			0
instinctively alert and aware of their surroundings , llamas draw attention to intruders - human or otherwise - by making a startling alarm call			0
if this is insufficient to deter the invader , the animals have been known to give chase , going on the attack with stout kicks and bites			0
they have , on occasion , even been known to kill predators as big as dogs or coyotes			0
there have been no recorded incidents of llamas bringing down @entity16 farm robbers yet , but a survey of @entity23 branch offices found more that three quarters believed members were more concerned about crime than a year ago			1
farmers have responded by taking more precautions , using cctv , locks and alarms becoming to secure their possessions - however , such measures are expensive , especially in these straitened times			0
fierce : llamas respond to intruders by making a distinctive alarm call before going on the attack and have even been known to bring down coyotes the majority of survey respondents ( 71 per cent ) said the bulk of rural thefts were planned , with criminals preferring to operate under the cover of darkness			1
the survey also revealed precious supplies such as high - priced power tools , heating oil , red diesel and quad bikes were most likely to be targeted by criminals			2
theft of metal and chemicals has been identified within the survey as growing trends over the last twelve months			2
chemicals used for crop spraying can cost more than Â£ 600 for 10 litres			0
@entity23 believes chemicals like these are now being targeted by organised gangs who ship them abroad to meet demand across @entity118			1
poor economic conditions and rising commodity prices are thought to be behind the surge in rural crime			1
@entity123 , group chief executive of @entity23 , said : ' the countryside has long been seen as an easy target for criminals			1
' encouragingly , country folk are not taking the blight lying down , fighting back with both high - tech security measures as well as more innovative schemes			0

rural crime up 6 per cent , says survey by @entity23
