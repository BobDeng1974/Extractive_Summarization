by @entity0 @entity1 : 20:35 est , 20 december 2013 @entity2 : 05:29 est , 21 december 2013 women with type 2 diabetes are three times as likely to have an early menopause , say researchers			1
a study by a team from the @entity10 in @entity11 showed the average age of menopause in women with diabetes was 48.5 years , as opposed to 50.1 years in non-diabetic women			1
this means a woman ’s natural supply of oestrogen runs out much earlier than would normally occur , raising the risk of a heart attack , stroke and bone disease in later life			0
acceleration : the authors of the study say that women with type 2 diabetes are more likely to have an early menopause in the @entity32 , the average age of the menopause is 51 years , when women ’s ovaries run out of eggs and they can no longer have children			1
the research published in the menopause journal @entity39 ( must credit ) comes increasing numbers of younger women are developing type 2 diabetes , the most common type			0
it is strongly linked to lifestyle factors such as being overweight or obese , leading a sedentary lifestyle and eating an unhealthy diet			0
a team led by dr @entity49 , of the @entity10 , @entity11 questioned 6,079 women aged between 40 and 59 years from 11 @entity52 countries about the menopause , depression and diabetes			1
they analysed their responses , taking into account factors such as weight , blood pressure and use of @entity61 ( @entity61 )			0
the study found menopause itself does not increase the risk of diabetes			1
but in contrast , women under 45 who have type 2 diabetes have almost three times the risk of an early menopause			1
the study showed the average age of menopause in women with diabetes was 48.5 years , as opposed to 50.1 years in non-diabetic women , with almost one - third of diabetic women aged 40 to 44 having already experienced the menopause			1
risks : diabetes is associated with a range of other difficulties the study also showed women classified as obese were 57 per cent more likely to have diabetes , and high blood pressure also increased the risk			2
in contrast to previous studies , the study found @entity61 increased the risk of diabetes by 14 per cent			1
dr @entity49 said ‘ the study shows several things			0
firstly , menopause itself does not increase the risk of diabetes , but conversely having type 2 diabetes triples the risk of an early menopause			2
‘ secondly , the associations between diabetes and menopause can be complex , which reinforces the message that women approaching the menopause need to be treated as individuals , and evaluated according to their own general health , background and risk factors			2
‘ diabetes is also associated with a generally poor quality of life , so we should encourage women to avoid risk factors for type 2 diabetes , such as being overweight or having high blood pressure			0
’ he said previous research found @entity61 cuts the risk for diabetes , but genetic differences or lower doses of oestrogen in modern drugs may account for the study ’s result			0
the study also found a mixed result for the association of alcohol with type 2 diabetes , with those women taking lower or moderate doses of alcohol having a reduced risk , whereas high alcohol intake was associated with a higher diabetes risk			2
climacteric editor dr @entity140 said ‘ premature menopause can impair health and life expectancy if poorly managed			0
' this study reinforces the importance of early diagnosis to detect and treat associated conditions such as diabetes , thus optimising short and long term wellbeing			0

study found average menopause age for diabetics is 48.5 years
it is 50.1 years women without , but having the disease before age 45 increases the early menopause risk *dramatically*
study was by *academics* from the @entity10 in @entity11
