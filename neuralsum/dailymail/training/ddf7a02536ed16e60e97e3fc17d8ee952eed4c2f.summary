by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 01:30 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 14:33 est , 4 march 2013 a new rival for the @entity3 has come under fire because of its name			0
the @entity7 model , from @entity9 car - maker @entity8 , is billed as a ' radical super-mini coupe which aims to set the streets alight '			1
but critics say @entity7 has unfortunate echoes of the name by which the @entity15 was known during its terror campaigns across @entity17 and @entity18			1
unfortunate : critics say @entity8 's new @entity7 model echoes the name by which the @entity15 was known @entity8 said the name had been chosen at its @entity25 headquarters in @entity26			1
a spokesman said : ' there was absolutely no intention to cause offence			1
the name comes from ' provoke ' – as in provoking a reaction			0
' ironically , despite the name , the roof of the model on display at the @entity36 is orange - the colour most closely associated with the @entity39 in @entity18			2
the @entity7 is powered by a turbo - charged 1.6 @entity41 204 horse - power petrol engine linked to a smart four - wheel - drive hybrid electric system that can add another 45 horse - power surge to the rear wheels as required and also allowing low - speed electric - only motion			2
it is not the first time foreign car firms have come a cropper with their choice of names			2
the term @entity7 is associated with the @entity15 in @entity18 and the @entity17			1
@entity53 , a group of @entity15 militants setting fire to a van in @entity58 in 1981 @entity59 : a @entity8 spokesman said the company has ' absolutely no intention to cause offence ' @entity65 car bosses at @entity66 got into trouble in january 2012 launching the ' @entity68 ! ' city car			1
@entity66 executives in @entity17 argued successfully for the name to be changed in the @entity17 to the ' @entity68 ! black ' , fearing that it could give offence to ethnic minorities because of the connotation of white actors and singers ' blacking up ' on stage to perform as minstrels			0
but in @entity65 and across the rest of @entity25 it continued to be sold as the ' @entity68 ! ' because @entity66 said the term did not have the same ‘ resonance ’ as in @entity17			0
@entity66 's @entity17 arm had sought in vain in the mid 1990s to change the name in the @entity17 of its first people - mover called the ' @entity89 ' fearing it sounded too close to ' @entity91 ' and had connotations of the downmarket ' @entity93 ' from @entity94			0
@entity98 ’s @entity97 , when pronounced by @entity100 owners , sounds uncannily like ' merde ! ' , while @entity103 ’s shogun off - roader is called the @entity104 in many markets - despite sounding like a rude @entity107 word for a sexual act			0
road wars : the @entity7 is set to take on the @entity3 and is billed as a ' radical super-mini coupe ' @entity103 also produced a car called the zero - the same name as the legendary @entity114 fighter which inflicted such heavy casualties on the allies during @entity117 in the 1960s @entity118 , now owned by @entity65 ’s @entity119 , were apparently going to call their successor to the @entity121 the ' @entity122 ' until it was pointed out that ' mist ' in @entity65 means pile of manure or dirt			1
@entity127 , parent company of @entity128 and @entity129 , produced a car called the @entity131 , which in @entity107 - speaking markets means ‘ no go			2
’ @entity133 has had a @entity134 and a @entity135 , though not in @entity17 markets			0
@entity114 ’s @entity137 missed a beat with its @entity139 .			0

@entity9 car - maker said the name was chosen at its offices in @entity26
