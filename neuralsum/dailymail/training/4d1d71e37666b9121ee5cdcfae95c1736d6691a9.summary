by @entity0 published : 09:35 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 09:54 est , 25 september 2013 @entity1 has revealed two gold limited edition handsets hot on the heels of @entity4 , after consumers went crazy for its golden @entity7 handset last week			1
the tech giant unveiled two limited edition @entity10 smartphones in gold and pink , and gold and brown colour combinations , but they will currently only be available for customers in the @entity17			1
while rumours of a golden @entity7 were mounting some time before the launch of @entity4 's latest high - end smartphone a fortnight ago , demand for the gold version of the @entity7 handset was reportedly higher than the firm expected			2
@entity1 has revealed two gold limited edition handsets			1
the tech giant unveiled two limited edition @entity10 smartphones in gold and pink and gold and brown colour combinations , but they will currently only be available for customers in the @entity17 region while it would be impossible for @entity1 to copy @entity4 's lucrative golden move in just two weeks , @entity34 believes @entity1 probably had its ear close to the @entity4 rumour mill to capitalise on the probable demand of gold handsets			1
so far it appears that the @entity1 handset will only be available in the @entity43 market , where @entity44 has previously launched a gold smartphone			1
a scarcity of the gold - colored @entity7 models drove ebay auction prices for the coveted items into the five figures			1
on monday this week , a single , unopened and unlocked @entity53 gold @entity7 , which retails for around $ 200 in the @entity54 on contract , sold for $ 10,100 ( £ 6,295 ) following a brief but bitter bidding war on the auction website			2
@entity58 , @entity4 ’s ceo , said : ' this is our best @entity7 launch yet - more than nine million new iphones sold ― a new record for first weekend sales			0
' on monday this week , a single , unopened and unlocked @entity53 gold @entity7 , which retails for around $ 200 , sold for $ 10,100 following a brief but bitter bidding war on ebay ' the demand for the new @entity7 has been incredible and while we ’ve sold out of our initial supply of @entity70 , stores continue to receive new @entity7 shipments regularly			2
' but according to @entity75 , unless you ordered your gold @entity7 in the first hour it became available friday , it wo n’t be shipping until october			0
@entity4 also took a gamble on demand for novel coloured smartphone with the launch of its @entity81 handsets			0
much like the unexpected demand of the gold @entity7 handset , the pink version of the cheaper handset has been a big success			0
sales figures show @entity4 's gamble with colourful @entity7 is paying off , with the pink model accounting for 46 per cent of sales - almost more than all the other colours combined reports from @entity94 found that the blue model is the second most - popular device , accounting for 32 per cent of @entity81 sales			2
in third place is green , at 12 per cent , followed by white at 9 per cent and yellow brings up the rear , accounting for just 1 per cent of sales			0
@entity4 could be looking to take this strategy into the @entity103 part of the business			0
experts have already said there could be at least two new @entity103 released as soon as next month .			0
