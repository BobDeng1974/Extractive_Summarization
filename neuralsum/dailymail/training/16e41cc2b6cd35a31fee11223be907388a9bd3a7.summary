based 4,300 miles away in @entity0 , the pilgrimage to @entity4 ’s @entity3 mansion has previously been confined to only the most devoted fans			1
but with 300 of @entity7 ’s most personal items being shipped to @entity8 for a nine - month public exhibition , soon anyone with a love of @entity7 will be able to have the full ‘ @entity3 experience ’			1
the @entity4 at the @entity16 exhibition will include some of the singer ’s trademark pieces , such as the leather outfit from his 1968 television special , the @entity14 jumpsuit @entity4 wore in the @entity21 to @entity23 concert , the @entity24 from his film @entity26 and his custom - made ‘ taking care of business ’ ring			1
he is pictured wearing his @entity21 jumpsuit , which is among the 300 - piece collection but it will also give a rare insight into @entity4 ’s personal life , putting on display items such as the first @entity41 present he was bought by @entity42 , 69 , his wallet containing a picture of his two year old daughter @entity45 and a gold phone from his home			1
@entity4 was found dead in the bathroom of @entity3 on august 16 , 1977 , aged 42 shortly before he was scheduled to begin another tour			1
@entity50 , @entity3 ’s director of archives , said : ‘ @entity4 did n’t have anything out in @entity3 that did n’t mean something to him because , obviously , he has thousands of pieces and gifts from fans , so everything @entity4 chose to put out was special to him			1
‘ i have close to a million documents , 5,000 pieces of wardrobe in the collection , it ’s massive			0
how i chose the exhibition was i asked myself : “ what are the key pieces that tell this story ” and i kept in mind that the majority of the people who come and see this exhibition will probably never have a chance to come and visit @entity3			1
‘ i wanted them to feel like they were part of this magical legacy that @entity4 has left behind			2
so it was really important to have his school report card , or the jump suit his wore for the @entity23 concert or the little pieces from @entity3			1
’ the exhibition , which will open next month , will include sections exploring mr @entity4 ’s childhood , his rise to fame in the 1950s , his time in the army , as a @entity90 star , his return to music with the 1968 television special and his later life in @entity95 , as well as more personal aspects of his character			1
elvis with a 1956 @entity100 car , which is one of the cars which will be on show at the @entity16 for the next nine - months fans will get the chance to see iconic item 's like the @entity7 's black leather suit from his 1968 tv special ( above ) while @entity3 does not want to put a price on any individual item , describing them all as ‘ priceless ’ , one piece that can have its financial worth estimated is the singer ’s ‘ @entity115 ’ ring			1
@entity4 had it custom made in 1974 by @entity119 in @entity0 , for a cost of around $ 35,000 , it is gold and onyx and contains 16 carats of diamonds with a solitaire of 11 and a half carats ion the middle			2
miss @entity50 said : ‘ @entity4 came up with the @entity128 logo in 1969 , it stands for taking care of business in a flash			2
‘ the first thing he had his jeweller make with that motif was necklaces , which he would give to close friends and entourage members			0
‘ it was his motto , his way of thinking			0
we ’re taking care of business , we ’re going to get this done , whether it ’s in personal life or professional , it was how he thought about things			0

he was the kind of guy who did n’t like to be chauffeured around , he would rather drive himself or even chauffer his friends around town			0
but he loved cars , they were really a status symbol for him			0
when he was able to buy cars it was a sign to him he had made it			0
they then became a thing that he would give away , if you were part of @entity4 ’s close group of people it would not be unusual for you to receive a car as a gift to say thank you or show how important you were to him ’			2
