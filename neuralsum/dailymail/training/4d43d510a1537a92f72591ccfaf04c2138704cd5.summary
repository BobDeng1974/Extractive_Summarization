‘ it was @entity5 ’s fond mother who attributed the healing of @entity5 when an infant to her prayers to the @entity59 , a young @entity11 nun			0

’ the @entity91 instruction follows allegations made by three un-named priests and one former priest who say that they were subjected to ‘ inappropriate ’ approaches by the cardinal 30 years ago			1
the complaints were made to the @entity91 ’s representative in @entity98 early last month – before pope @entity99 announced his resignation , but after @entity44 had made known to @entity101 that he wished to resign ‘ in view of his 75th birthday ’			1
the sudden departure of the cardinal leaves the church grappling with the implications of a new sex scandal affecting its senior leadership and denies @entity4 @entity3 any influence on the voting when 116 cardinals gather to elect @entity99 ’s replacement next month			1
the affair intensified the sense of intrigue and conspiracy that has grown around the @entity118 since @entity99 made the surprise announcement of his own decision to quit on february 11			2

’ he added that he had been ‘ happy to know ’ that on november 13 last year the @entity72 had accepted his resignation , but that it would take effect at an unspecified later date			0
position : the archbishop was the head of the @entity3 in @entity11 and the @entity4 's senior priest senior church figures are expected to go at 75 , but the @entity91 often allows leeway of a year or two			1
following news of the sex scandal over the weekend , the @entity72 gave @entity44 no choice			0
‘ the holy father has now decided that my resignation will take effect today , 25 february 2013 , and that he will appoint an @entity169 to govern the @entity170 in my place until my successor is appointed , ’ @entity44 said			2
the decision means he will no longer travel to @entity101 as planned to take part in the conclave that will elect the next @entity72 in march			1
the @entity87 said in his statement : ‘ i thank pope @entity99 for his kindness and courtesy to me and … i wish him a long and happy retirement			1

’ saying mass in @entity9 : cardinal @entity190 in his role as @entity4 's most senior @entity3 @entity44 , who on sunday missed a mass in @entity193 in @entity9 that had been intended to celebrate eight years of @entity99 ’s papacy , has contested claims of inappropriate behaviour made against him			1
the claims were made to the @entity198 , the @entity91 ambassador in @entity98 , @entity198 , in the week before the announcement of @entity99 ’s resignation on february 11			1
according to the @entity203 newspaper , one former priest claims @entity44 made an inappropriate approach to him in 1980 , after night prayers , when he was a seminarian at @entity207 , @entity207			1
the man , who is now married , says he resigned as a priest when @entity44 was first made a bishop			0
he said in his complaint : ‘ i knew then he would always have power over me			0
it was assumed i left the priesthood to get married			0
i left to preserve my integrity			0
’ in @entity101 : the cardinal had been due to travel to the @entity91 to take part in the forthcoming papal conclave a second statement from another priest says he was living in a parish when he was visited by @entity44 , and inappropriate contact took place between them			1
a third man said he had had to deal with ‘ unwanted behaviour ’ by the cardinal in the 1980s after some late - night drinking			1
the fourth complaint came from a priest who said the cardinal used night prayers as an excuse for inappropriate contact			1
retiring : pope @entity99 delivers his blessing during his last @entity237 noon prayer from a window overlooking @entity239 at the @entity91 yesterday a @entity91 adviser in @entity11 , professor @entity241 of @entity242 , said : ‘ the resignation of @entity44 as @entity244 and @entity9 , within a month of the date on which his formal resignation would normally have taken effect is both shocking and sad			1
‘ given the nature of the accusations , however , and the publication of them over the weekend , ahead of the formal abdication of @entity99 later in the week , it is unsurprising that he has taken the decision to resign			2
’ professor @entity241 , added : ‘ @entity87 could not but be mindful of the problems that would follow given the inevitable press interest created by the accusations , and he would not want that burden to fall upon the @entity3 and the @entity72 at what is obviously a critical moment in the life of the @entity3 community			0
' the departure of the @entity87 leaves the five million faithful in @entity4 without a representative when the new @entity72 is chosen			0
it will mean that the number of cardinals with the power to vote in the conclave for @entity99 ’s successor is reduced to 116 , with at least one other withdrawal a possibility between now and the opening of discussions in the @entity91 next month			1
there are some 750,000 catholics in @entity11 who would have been represented by the @entity87 as @entity244 and @entity9			2
more than four million @entity3 in @entity279 and @entity280 will be unrepresented in the final reckoning because there is no qualified cardinal among their leaders			0
cardinal @entity285 , who stepped down as @entity287 in 2009 , is 80 , and so too old to join the voting bloc of cardinals			0
he will , however , travel to @entity101 to take part in advisory talks			1
his successor as archbishop of @entity294 , the most reverend @entity293 , has yet to be given a cardinal ’s hat more than three years after taking over as leader of @entity3 in @entity279 and @entity280			1
some observers believe this is because @entity99 has been suspicious of what he sees as liberal tendencies among @entity279 bishops			2
another cardinal is under pressure to follow @entity16 out of the conclave			0
@entity306 , former archbishop of @entity307 , who is being urged to step down by lobby groups who accuse him of covering up sex abuse by priests			2
