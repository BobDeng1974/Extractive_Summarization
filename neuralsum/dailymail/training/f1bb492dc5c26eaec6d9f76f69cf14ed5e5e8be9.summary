@entity12 , a nurse , said she held @entity14 ’s hand as she suffered complications following a routine tonsil operation and reassured her that the doctors knew what they were doing			1
but just minutes later @entity14 ’s heart stopped and caused so much brain damage that those same doctors now want to turn off the ventilator that keeps her alive			1
distraught : @entity12 with pictures of her and granddaughter @entity14 mrs @entity12 , who works at a different hospital to where her granddaughter is being treated , said that the memory had left her distraught and destroyed the trust she had in the medical profession			1
' she was so frightened , ' a visibly moved mrs @entity12 said from her home just a few miles from where @entity14 remained in intensive care at @entity33 in @entity1 , @entity34			1
' i was with her [ when ] the complications began , when the blood started to come out of her mouth			2
i was the one holding her hand and reassuring her that everything was going to be ok			0
' ' she said ‘ ' @entity41 this hurt so bad " and i said everything would work out and it has n’t			0
' that is the devastating part			0
i feel so bad because @entity14 was so scared			1
i feel so bad because i think @entity14 , the sweetest girl in the world , suffered so badly			1
' mrs @entity12 , 50 , a grandmother - of - four , said that when the complications began she told the nurse to get a doctor , but claimed that no one took her seriously enough			2
devastated : @entity12 , a nurse , was trying to reassure @entity14 when the teenager went into cardiac arrest fight : @entity14 's family are fighting to keep the 13 - year - old on life support she said that it was only when she noticed that @entity14 ’s vital signs were slipping away and she shouted across the intensive care unit that any proper action was taken			1
by then it was too late for a crash team to resuscitate her in time to stop devastating brain damage – damage so severe that the hospital wants to turn off her life support machine because it claims there is no chance of her recovering			1
mrs @entity12 , who along with @entity14 ’s other relatives are fighting the move because they believe she can still recover , said the treatment by the hospital had destroyed her faith in the medical profession			1
' i really trusted the doctors , ' she said			0
' i held her hand and said so			0
i reassure and encourage people every day			0
i ’ll never be able to reassure anyone ever again			0
' she said that she had been appalled by the behavior of the doctors at the hospital who she alleges have been ' heartless ' in their treatment of the family			1
she said a few days after her daughter ’s complications the hospital told them the only option was to contact the coroner			2
but when the family asked for a second opinion , she claims the hospital ’s chief of pediatrics dr @entity98 was brutal in his reply			1
' we asked for a second opinion and dr @entity98 came in and said " what do n’t you understand ? she is dead , dead , dead "			0
' memories : @entity12 with @entity14 , far right , at the wedding of the teenager 's mother ' i could n’t believe how heartless they were			1
if that happened in my hospital i would be so upset and embarrassed			2
' that is when we got an attorney involved			0
now all we want is to be free of @entity33 so that we can take her to a hospital that will care for her			2
' we want to be able to say that we tried everything we could for her			0
we are not crazy people looking for a miracle			0
' i am a nurse			0
i do believe the body has an amazing ability to heal itself			0
but these doctors are used to playing @entity126 and they are not used to people questioning their opinion			0
' mrs @entity12 ’s comments came as the hospital and family remain in legal stalemate , each accusing the other of misinformation			1
the relatives ' attorney @entity136 claims that the hospital is blocking their attempts to transfer @entity14 to another facility , while hospital spokesman @entity141 said that the family had not fulfilled any statutory requirements for the move			1
all that is known is that arrangements have to be made before a court injunction runs out at 5pm next tuesday or the hospital can switch off the life support machine			1
the wrangling has left mrs @entity12 emotionally exhausted			2
' all my tears have gone because i have cried so much , ' she said			0
' i am just in defense mode now			0
we have to take it day by day			0
we are a normal family			2
people do n’t die early in our family			2
