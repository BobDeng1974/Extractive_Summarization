@entity0 were embroiled in fresh controversy this weekend amid claims the club takeover in 2012 may have been partly financed by a fund co-owned by the @entity6 government			1
if @entity6 money did help finance the takeover , that could contravene international sanctions , sources familiar with the deal have told @entity13			2
the alleged @entity6 funding may defy a @entity17 @entity16 ( @entity16 ) resolution and is the latest extraordinary twist in the recent history of @entity0 , although this publication has seen no evidence to verify such claims			1
@entity23 is the current @entity0 owner having bought the club earlier this year @entity13 can also reveal further turmoil lies ahead - entirely separate from the @entity6 issue - as the @entity29 attempt to obtain a copy of an @entity32 legal judgment that could result in the club ’s current majority owner , @entity23 , being deemed unfit to retain his shareholding			1
@entity23 bought 75 per cent of @entity0 from @entity37 bankers @entity38 ( @entity38 ) earlier this year			1
@entity38 and related parties retain 25 per cent of the club			2
it is @entity38 ’s original purchase of the club in 2012 that allegedly involved @entity6 money , sources say			1
@entity38 bought @entity0 from @entity45 in december 2012 via a @entity46 - based subsidiary @entity38 and insiders say they were so strapped for cash to complete the deal , they suspect money was temporarily borrowed from another company it co-owned , the @entity51 , to get the buyout across the line			1
@entity23 bought 75 per cent of @entity0 from @entity37 bankers @entity38 ( @entity38 ) the @entity51 is co-owned by an investment vehicle in turn owned by the @entity57 , who , under @entity16 sanctions , have been prohibited from various aspects of international trading in an attempt to stop @entity6 developing a nuclear weapons programme			1
there is no suggestion @entity45 knew any money from @entity38 was ultimately owned by any party other than @entity38 or has done anything wrong			2
the @entity16 have yet to respond to @entity13 about enquiries on the subject			2
senior @entity38 officials in @entity37 and @entity46 , as well as two spokesmen for the firm , have also failed to answer any questions			1
the @entity29 will not comment on any private transaction in a takeover			0
in laymen ’s terms , the @entity29 can not be certain and they do not even necessarily have the remit to discover how money is sourced for a club takeover			0
on - the - pitch @entity0 drew 1 - 1 at home to @entity83 wednesday in their @entity85 derby on saturday afternoon the @entity29 ’s chief executive , @entity86 , finds himself in a particularly uncomfortable position			0
he was the @entity0 ceo when @entity38 bought the club			1
he is understood to have had no knowledge of any potential contravention , alleged or otherwise , of rules during the time he worked under @entity38			2
he left the club in 2013			0
sources believe @entity38 ‘ borrowed ’ the @entity51 money to make up a shortfall needed to pay @entity45 for his stake in @entity0 and later put money back into @entity99 ’s account			1
yet @entity38 ’s ownership of @entity0 turned out to be an unmitigated failure , as promised funds failed to materialise			2
the club haemorrhaged money under their ownership , and @entity38 eventually sold 75 per cent of @entity0 earlier this year to convicted fraudster @entity23			1
no other prospective buyer aside from the maverick @entity32 millionaire was willing to meet the £ 35million price tag @entity38 wanted			0
@entity110 rescued a point for @entity0 in the 79th minute at @entity112 @entity23 was initially prevented from completing his own takeover after the @entity29 ruled he was not a ‘ fit and proper person ’ , following a tax evasion conviction relating to a yacht			1
he won an appeal on that decision , pending the release of a detailed judgment which should clarify whether he had been guilty of a crime of dishonesty , or not			0
if the full verdict says he is dishonest , the @entity29 will attempt to force him to sell @entity0			0
the @entity29 ’s problem is that they have no right to access the full verdict			0
@entity23 ’s @entity32 lawyer is the only person , aside from the court , with a full copy			0
@entity110 ( bottom ) celebrates his goal with his @entity0 team - mates , with the club 14th in the championship it has been reported that in the full tax case ruling , sardinian judge @entity135 said there was ‘ elusive intent ’ and ‘ machiavellian simulation ’ by @entity23			2
the problem for the @entity29 is accessing the document			0
lawyers for the @entity29 and @entity143 have spoken in the past few days and the @entity0 owner believes the @entity29 are considering some kind of misconduct charge for not giving it to them			0
the charge , theoretically , would be that @entity143 has failed to notify the league of a change in declarations about his ‘ fit and proper ’ status			0
@entity23 ’s lawyers would mount legal challenges to any charge			0

@entity0 takeover in 2012 may have been partly financed by a fund co-owned by the @entity6 government
the alleged @entity6 funding may defy a @entity16 resolution
@entity23 bought 75 per cent of @entity0 from @entity37 bankers @entity38
