@entity1 chairman @entity0 on friday characterized @entity3 ' top presidential contenders as either too snooty or too handsy to manage the country while addressing conservatives at their annual gabfest and jubilee			2
' they 've got one candidate ready to coronate herself , ' @entity0 said , referring to former first lady @entity10 disparaging @entity3 ' prospects of winning the presidency in 2016 , @entity0 said , ' they have a sitting vice president who ca n't control his mouth - or his hands			1
' @entity0 ' taunting of @entity19 follows an incident last week in which the vice president got up close and personal with defense secretary @entity23 's wife , @entity22 , while the new @entity25 chief was being sworn in @entity19 put his hands on @entity23 's shoulders , groping her while he whispered in her ear			1
the vp has a reputation for being flirty			0
a photo of him cozying up to a biker at a @entity48 campaign spot went viral in 2012			0
he put his hands on her , too , and appeared to draw the ire of her male companions			2
attempting to energize conservatives ahead of next year 's national election , @entity0 said the right can win if it puts in the hard work			1
then ' we 'll have a @entity1 president , and @entity60 will never belong to the @entity61 again , ' he told his audience at the @entity63 , held just down the @entity64 from @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity67			1
@entity0 warned that at @entity69 presidency would be more of the same			2
' i can guarantee you @entity72 , you 're not going to get something different than @entity74 with a member of the @entity74 administration , ' he said			0
' you 're going to get a third term of @entity74			0
' to good news for @entity80 , @entity0 said , is the more voters hear from @entity10 , the less they like her			1
her approval rating was the highest when she was out of the country and off the campaign trail , he contended			0
' ' that 's probably why @entity10 barely comes out in public these days , ' he said			2
' if there 's not a private luxury jet , and a quarter million dollar speaking fee waiting for her , you can forget about it			2
' the real reason @entity69 has mostly kept out of the public eye in 2015 is because she ' does n't have much to say , ' he charged			0
if you ask her press people for her opinion on issues of the day such as the @entity104 and the fight against @entity106 , they say , ' no comment , ' the @entity80 's top tongue wager told guests of @entity63			2
' i 'm sure @entity74 wishes @entity19 would follow that example			2
' do n't tell @entity111 ! : vice president @entity19 has a reputation for being flirty with women other than his wife , @entity111			1
he 's pictured here getting up close and personal with a customer at a diner while on the campaign trail in 2012 @entity0 joked today that after mixing up croute de te with an ethnic group the vice president would then ' rub your neck without permission ' at that point , roughly six minutes in to his remarks , @entity0 interrupted himself to say : ' oh and by the way , if i was @entity10 , this speech would have have already cost you $ 20,000			1
' @entity0 used that line to launch into a lengthy parody of both @entity69 and @entity19			1
' @entity10 would never speak here , ' he said			2
not because she 's a @entity3 but because of her ' @entity133 style backstage demands ' that are included in her speaking contracts			0
' well you know i checked back stage			0
there was insufficient @entity141 , the water temperature was off by a few degrees , and i do n't think that the lemon wedges were cut quite at the right angle , ' he said			1
he then asserted that @entity69 , who last year attracted negative attention for noting that her family was ' dead broke ' when it left the @entity148 , has ' lost touch ' with @entity72			0
vice president @entity19 is out of touch , @entity0 said			1
' if you asked @entity152 is , he 'd probably say this : " oh yeah i had a great relationship with that community			0
there 's an awful lot of them driving cabs in @entity160 , for real man , they 're friends of mine			0
" ' and then of course he 'd rub your neck without permission , ' @entity0 added			0
the remarks about cab drivers was a mockery of @entity19 's claim last week that a ' very identifiable ' community of @entity173 have made his hometown , @entity175 , @entity160 , their home away from home			1
' if you ever come to the train station with me you ’ll notice i have great relationships with them because there ’s an awful lot driving cabs and are friends of mine , ' @entity19 said while speaking at the @entity148 's counter terror summit			1
i ’m not being solicitous			0
' @entity10 served as a punching bag throughout the day on friday and speakers took turns beating her up to the delight of their conservative followers			0
@entity194 sen. @entity193 said she was a politician of ' yesterday			0
' @entity196 sen. @entity195 said , ' it 's time for @entity10 to retire			2
' both men are contemplating presidential campaigns and could find themselves facing off with her in a general election in 2016			0
questionnaires how she would easily win against any of the possible @entity80 candidates , but @entity195 and @entity193 would fare the best against her , losing by seven points a piece , according to a @entity209 survey released on friday .			0
