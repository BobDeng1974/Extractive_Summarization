a cabinet minister today accused the @entity1 of being ' utterly negative ' about the government 's flagship welfare reforms			0
@entity4 hit back at @entity5 interviewer @entity7 's claims that the @entity9 system had been ' dogged ' with problems			1
the @entity11 claimed the @entity12 was determined to look for problems in his changes to the benefit system , but insisted they remain on track			0
work and pensions secretary @entity4 today accused @entity5 presenter @entity7 of being ' utterly negative ' about the government 's welfare reforms mr @entity4 admitted making mistakes in the plans to roll out flagship benefit reforms and said the original 2017 deadline had been ' artificial '			1
@entity9 is now being rolled out to families in the north west of @entity26 but it is expected to take until 2019 to put all claimants on to the system			1
he said the original plans for rolling out the welfare changes , which combine benefits into a single payment , had been wrong and he had taken the decision two years ago to ' reset ' the timings of the project because he recognised that it needed a longer timescale			1
but being interviewed on @entity5 's today programme , mr @entity4 repeatedly hit back at the idea that the @entity9 programme was in crisis			1
miss @entity42 suggested that ministers had so far only tackled the easy claimants – or the ' low hanging fruit ' – and as time goes on it will take longer			0
but mr @entity4 insisted : ' i know you want to try and look at this in an utterly negative way			1
' let me explain to you ... what we are doing			0
this is not about low - hanging fruit ; we have deliberately set out to roll it out so that each bit of it is tested			0
' there is nothing low - hanging about an individual looking for work needing better support			0
' so a single person , we get that right ; we 've then got couples , that 's right , that 's rolling out ; we 're now doing families			0
' this is deliberately done like this so that we can ensure that as we roll it out we get all the complexities ironed out			0
' as the exchange became more fraught , mr @entity4 went on : ' you 've said that it 's constantly dogged			1
' i decided two years ago , having had some outside work look at this , that the wrong way to roll it out , as was originally planned , was to roll it out like tax credits , which as you may remember had been a disaster			0
they crashed and 400,000 people did n't get their payments			0
' i hope anyone listening will recognise that if we do it carefully and we land it safely , they are far better off than trying to rush something for a simple deadline , which actually was artificial in the first place			0
' mr @entity4 announced to the @entity96 conference in september that he was planning to accelerate the national roll - out of @entity9 to every community in @entity99 by the end of 2015 - 16			1
a @entity1 spokesman defended the interview , adding : ' the roll - out of @entity9 is a key policy of the government , and it was relevant to raise some recent criticisms with the cabinet minister responsible			2
@entity4 was given ample opportunity to put his point across			2
' the exchange happened as miss @entity42 tackled the @entity96 minister over the progress of @entity9 during the today programme on @entity5 the @entity114 said today that this will mean one in three of the country 's @entity115 taking claims for the new benefit by spring 2015			1
and six @entity115 in the @entity119 are now taking claims from couples with children and lone parents , who will receive support for childcare via @entity9 for the first time			1
payments will initially cover 70 per cent of childcare costs , rising to 85 per cent in 2016 , as announced in the @entity129			0
@entity9 is already available to single and couple claimants in more than 80 @entity115 in @entity26 , @entity131 and @entity132 and will be available in nearly 100 @entity115 by @entity133 , said the @entity114			2
the department cited research suggesting that claimants find @entity9 easier to understand than the previous array of benefits and considered that it provided better financial incentives to work			2
but shadow work and pensions secretary @entity141 said the @entity9 programme had become ' a complete shambles '			2
' the latest figures from the @entity114 show just 17,850 people are claiming @entity9 - less than 1 per cent of the million people @entity4 said would be on the new benefit in april 2014 , ' said ms @entity141			1
' @entity148 wants @entity9 to succeed but the government 's mishandling of the programme has led to huge waste and delays with over £ 130 million of taxpayers ' money wasted on failed it			1
it 's another example of @entity96 welfare waste			0
' a @entity148 government would pause @entity9 for three months to examine whether the programme can be rescued from the shambles @entity160 has left it in			2

@entity4 hits back at claims @entity9 is in trouble
*condemns* @entity5 's @entity7 for saying it is ' dogged ' with problems
says he ' reset ' the timings of the project it needed a longer timescale
