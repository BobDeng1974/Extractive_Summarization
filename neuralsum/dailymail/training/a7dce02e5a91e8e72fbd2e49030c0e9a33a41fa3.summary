many hotels , especially the most luxurious , now come with free @entity1 as standard , but many of us assume that when we connect to these networks , our data is secure			2
security experts have uncovered a threat that specifically targets such networks to steal information and even delete confidential data from visitors			1
the so - called @entity13 campaign is believed to have been active for the past four years and works with ‘ surgical precision ’ to target even the most secure , and private , networks			1
the cybercriminals begin by infiltrating hotel web networks , through a variety of methods			0
they typically target the networks in luxury hotels , and can handpick their victims @entity16 was uncovered by experts from @entity20 ’s @entity19 team			1

once it has access to a network , the @entity13 attackers select a high - powered victim and wait until they connect to the @entity1 , ultimately entering their room number and surname at the login			2
when travelling , any network , even semi-private ones in hotels , should be viewed as potentially dangerous , said @entity47			2
to prevent this , the experts warn that travellers should avoid updating software or clicking files when not on trusted networks			2
they should also keep their antivirus software up - to - date , before they leave their home			0
the attackers then trick the person into downloading and installing a so - called backdoor file , which pretends to be an update for legitimate software , such as the @entity61 , @entity62 or @entity63			1
the unsuspecting victim downloads this hotel ‘ welcome package ’ , only to infect his machine with @entity16 ’s spying software			1
once on a system , the backdoor has been , and may be used , to further download more advanced stealing tools such as an advanced keylogger or the @entity73 ’			0
these tools collect data about the system and the anti-malware software installed on it , steals all keystrokes , and hunts for cached passwords in @entity80 , @entity81 and internet explorer			0
it also looks for @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , and @entity89 login credentials , as well as other private information			0
the attacks are particularly targetted at successful businessmen and women			0
attackers are able to acquire sensitive and confidential information , such as intellectual property of businesses that the people represent			1

they then trick the victim into downloading and installing a malicious file , pretending to be update for legitimate software , such as the @entity61 or @entity62 after the operation , the attackers delete their tools from the hotel network and go back into hiding , explained @entity112 , principal security researcher at @entity20 ‘ for the past few years , @entity16 has performed a number of successful attacks against high - profile individuals , employing methods and techniques that go well beyond typical cybercriminal behaviour			1
@entity120 , technical director at @entity121 , which provides @entity1 to hotels including @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 told @entity127 : ' this story is yet another example of scare - mongery around personal cyber security , that could actually do more harm good			1
' our platform contains customers ' guest data within @entity137 secured pages so it can not be intercepted as it is fully encrypted point to point			0
' added to this guests can install a mobile internet security app that allows them set their own privacy levels and have complete peace of mind that their personal data is safe wherever and whenever they access the web			0
' ‘ this threat actor has operational competence , mathematical and crypto - analytical offensive capabilities , and other resources that are sufficient to abuse trusted commercial networks and target specific victim categories with strategic precision			1
’ the most recent travelling targets include top executives from the @entity157 and @entity158 including chief executives , senior vice presidents , sales and marketing directors			2
@entity47 did not reveal the names of those affected , however , or the specific hotels			0
‘ the mix of both targeted and indiscriminate attacks is becoming more and more common , where targeted attacks are used to compromise high - profile victims , and botnet - style operations are used for mass surveillance , ’ added mr @entity112			1
