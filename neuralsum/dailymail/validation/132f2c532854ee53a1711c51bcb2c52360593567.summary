coroner @entity0 , who claims she has been left in fear of violence after being falsely accused of anti-semitism a senior coroner has accused @entity5 of bullying and intimidating her in an extraordinary row over the handling of dead bodies			1
@entity0 claims she and her staff have been left in fear of violence after being bombarded by hundreds of complaints about how they deal with deaths in devoutly religious communities			1
in a letter seen by @entity16 , she says she has been falsely accused of anti-semitism and warns the situation risks becoming ‘ volatile ’			1
she says that on one occasion the police had to be called when 60 @entity5 refused to let undertakers take the body of a man whose body they wanted to pray over			1
mrs @entity0 believes other families in the @entity28 area she covers are ‘ suffering ’ because she has to spend so much of her time dealing with the large number of @entity5 , whose faith requires them to bury their dead quickly and prevents them undergoing autopsies			1
but the @entity5 say they are being ‘ traumatised ’ by the coroner ’s disregard for their beliefs , forcing them to take unprecedented legal action against her			1
both sides will soon face each other in the @entity43 in a case that could lead to all families being given the right to demand a high - tech scan to determine cause of death rather than the traditional surgical post- mortem examination			0
in a letter to her bosses at @entity53 , mrs @entity0 writes : ‘ i look forward to hearing how you intend to support those who work within the service for which you have statutory responsibility , and protect them from bullying , intimidation and the threat of violence			1
’ but rabbi @entity63 told this newspaper : ‘ the jewish community is increasingly traumatised by mrs @entity0 ’s conduct			2
it ’s getting to the point where elderly people are scared to die in @entity69 – literally			0
a pair of @entity5 wait for a bus in @entity28			2
in their faith , they believe they need to bury their loved ones within a day of their death so the period of mourning can begin ‘ i ’m actually aware of at least one elderly couple who have happily lived in the @entity80 since the @entity81 but who have now emigrated permanently due to their fear of being subjected to unnecessary delays of their funerals when they pass away – or , worse still , a post-mortem autopsy			0
’ the row has arisen because @entity90 believe they need to bury their loved ones within a day of their death so the period of mourning can begin			2
they also believe that traditional post-mortem examinations amount to desecration of the body			0
but when a doctor is unable to state a cause of death and sign the medical certificate needed before a body can be released for burial , a coroner must decide if a post-mortem examination is required			0
this process can take several days			0
following years of campaigning by @entity105 and @entity90 – who share many beliefs on burial customs – the @entity109 has agreed that all coroners in @entity28 will operate an out - of - hours service from next month			0
others in @entity69 and @entity113 already do so .			0
