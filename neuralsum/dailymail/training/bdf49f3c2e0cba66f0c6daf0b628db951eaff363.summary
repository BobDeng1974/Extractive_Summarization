by @entity1 reporter researchers found the one glass of wine many drivers think is acceptable may be too much for over- 55s having just one glass of wine could be enough to dangerously affect older drivers , researchers have warned			1
in tests comparing the effects of alcohol on different age groups , they found that the driving skills of the over- 55s plummeted compared to younger people			1
the research involved 36 people aged 25 to 35 and 36 people aged 55 to 70 who took a computer - based driver simulation test while sober and then again after varying amounts of alcohol , although not enough to put them over the drink - drive limit			1
each person was assessed as they ‘ drove ’ down a simulated three - mile stretch of winding country road			2
the drivers stared straight ahead at a large computer monitor			0
two computer monitors flanked the first , mimicking the side windows of a car and what the drivers would see in their peripheral vision			0
occasionally , the drivers would encounter an oncoming car , but they did not encounter other distractions , ' not even a cow '			0
after a drink , and a time lapse to mimic having alcohol with their dinner and then driving home , they were put behind the wheel again			2
the researchers from the @entity46 found that the small , legal levels of intoxication only affected the driving abilities of the older group			1
they assessed the drivers ’ ability to stay in the centre of their lane and maintain a constant speed			1
they also looked at how rapidly they adjusted their steering wheel			0
professor of psychiatry and psychology dr @entity62 said they found it a ‘ bit surprising ’ that younger drivers ’ skills were not affected by the alcohol , although she warned that the tests did not prove they would be safer on real roads			2
the researchers found young people managed to stay in the centre of their lane and maintain the same speed phd student @entity73 said : ' these simulations have been used a lot in looking at older adults , and they have been used at looking how alcohol affects the driving of younger adults , but no one ’s ever looked at the combination of aging drivers and alcohol			1
' further research is planned to measure how the brain responds during the driving test when dosed with alcohol			0
the findings are published in the journal @entity89 .			0

different aged groups took simulated test before and after a drink
researchers at @entity46 found legal level affected older group
under - 55s managed to stay in centre of lane and maintain speed
