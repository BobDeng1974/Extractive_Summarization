the first hour - long tour through the @entity9 's current exhibition , ' @entity10 : a retrospective ' , took place on wednesday night , in a no - frills approach to art led by @entity16 - based artist @entity15			1
' everyone 's all in it together , so it 's not weird or anything , ' said one man who attended the tour			1
and because of the light installations , everyone is very neutral , ' one woman told the @entity33			0
' it just gives it a very different perspective			0
' @entity15 , the tour guide for the retrospective , which highlights the 70 - year - old @entity40 artist 's 50 years of work , said the experience creates an ' educational state ' for viewing the art. ' while to some people this might be a joke , it 's not to me			1
i take this very seriously , ' @entity15 told @entity51			2
' it 's all about education through experience			0
witnessing everyone take their clothes off and leave them in a pile is really quite profound , ' he said			0
' you realise how complex and socially fabricated we are , connected through clothes '			0
' everyone 's all in it together , so it 's not weird or anything , ' said one man who attended the tour the tour ran for an hour after the @entity9 was closed for the evening mr @entity15 has already been the guide on nude gallery tours at the @entity72 in @entity73 and @entity74 in @entity75 @entity15 is no stranger to nude education , having guided similar tours at the @entity72 in @entity73 and @entity74 in @entity75			1
the tours , which will run again on thursday night , is an adventure through @entity10 's body of work , and include installations purpose - built for @entity83 , as well as drawings , prints and photographs			1
the custom built light program will project different colours onto the viewers , which @entity15 said will be one of the most interesting elements of the nude tour			1
he expects people ' from all walks of life ' to join in the tours , and was adamant about offering concessions for the exhibition so that a cross section of society might be emboldened to give nudity a go			0
' we all share the same humanity , and it 's wonderful to see people come along and be so happy			0
i liken the tours to a 40th birthday party of a reunion of long lost friends , ' @entity15 said			2
@entity15 is no stranger to nude education , having guided similar tours at the @entity72 in @entity73 and @entity74 in @entity75 you do n't have the clothing distracting you			2
and because of the light installations , everyone is very neutral , ' said one woman mr @entity15 said that he was interested to see how the light displays interacted with the naked bodies ' we often get nudists who are really excited to come to events , because for them it 's exciting that society is saying " you 're ok , you can participate " , ' he said			1
' art students also tend to come along , but there is always someone who has never done something like this before , ' ' i had one woman who was so nervous but came up to me afterwards and thanked me for running the tour because she had had so much shame around her body and was able to overcome her fears			2
' @entity15 maintains that there is nothing sexual about the tours , and said that the human body is more sexualised with clothes on			2
' with clothes on , the imagination is engaged , but with them off , there is n't the same hook			0
the body is quite de-sexualised , ' @entity15 said			2
' people do n't believe me when i say this , but people all look the same with their clothes off			0
an 18 - year - old looks like a 70 - year - old , ' he said			1

he said that nude tours in particular are excellent vehicles for promoting acceptance of one 's body , and also to engage in an activity normally considered quite risque			2
