a white @entity1 girl who claims that she was refused admission to college because of her race will take her case to the @entity6 tomorrow			1
if she wins , a precedent will be set throwing the use of race - conscious admissions policies at public universities into doubt			1
@entity13 , who has since graduated from @entity14 , said she was subject to unequal treatment in violation of the 14th amendment			0
@entity13 says she was subject to unequal treatment in violation of the 14th amendment in not being admitted to the @entity19 and on wednesday , all eyes will be on justice @entity21 , whose vote is considered pivotal in the case brought @entity13 who has sued the @entity19 , claiming that she was denied admission to the school in 2008 because of affirmative action			1
' i was taught from the time i was a little girl that any kind of discrimination was wrong , and for an institution of higher learning to act this way makes no sense to me , ' @entity13 said in an interview clip posted on the website of the @entity37 , a legal defense foundation that 's providing her with legal representation			0
on the other side are lawyers for the @entity19 , who argue that , like many other universities , @entity19 seeks to assemble a class that is diverse in innumerable ways -- including race -- and that ' race is just one of many characteristics that form the mosaic presented by an applicant 's file			2
' more than 90 friend of the court briefs have been filed in the case , with the @entity57 administration weighing in favor of the university			0
others , who support @entity13 , argue that diversity can be achieved through race - neutral programs , and that race - preferential admissions policies can do more harm than good			1
' what 's at issue is : ( 1 ) whether it will remain permissible to consider race in an attempt to ensure that higher level education remains integrated ; and ( 2 ) whether universities or the court are going to be the ones to determine what academic diversity consists of , ' said @entity77 , a professor at @entity78 , who believes @entity19 's plan should be upheld			2
it was only recently , in 2003 , that the @entity6 narrowly upheld the limited use of race in public university admissions policies in @entity85			1
the five - four opinion was written by justice @entity87 , who said that diversity was a compelling government interest			0
but @entity87 has since retired from the high court , and has been replaced by justice @entity91 , who is more skeptical of race - conscious admissions preferences			1
@entity6 @entity21 's vote is thought to be pivotal to the decision the @entity6 reaches in the @entity13 case in 1997 , the @entity1 legislature passed the ' @entity98 , ' which mandates that @entity1 high school seniors in the top 10 percent of their class be automatically admitted to any @entity1 state university			1
but after the @entity85 decision came down , another policy was added that allows the school to consider race among several other factors for admission			2
@entity13 did not qualify for automatic admission , and was forced to compete with other non-top - 10 - percent state applicants			1
she said she was denied admission , even though her academic credentials exceeded those of some of the admitted minority candidates			1
the @entity19 , which was racially segregated during the first 70 years of its existence , argues that its current program exemplifies the type of plan the @entity6 allowed in @entity85 : ' race is only one modest factor among many others weighed ; it is considered only in an individualized and contextual way that examines the student in their totality			0
' the @entity128 @entity6 will begin hearing the case of @entity13 tomorrow - who claims she was denied a place at college because of her race but lawyers for @entity13 said that the top 10 percent plan had made @entity19 one of the most diverse public universities in the nation , and that the school did not need to overlay the successful race - neutral program with another one that considered race			1
furthermore , they said that the school is working toward an impermissible goal of using race in admissions to mirror the demographics of @entity1 , which they said amounted to ' racial balancing			1
' while @entity13 's lawyers argue that @entity85 should be clarified or even overturned , supporters of @entity19 's program take solace in @entity21 's opinion in @entity85			0
he ruled against the @entity157 program named in that case but said , ' there is no constitutional objection to the goal of considering race as one modest factor among many others to achieve diversity , but an educational institution must ensure , through sufficient procedures , that each applicant receives individual consideration and that race does not become a predominant factor in the admissions decision making			0
' despite those words , @entity21 has never -- in his entire career on the bench -- voted in favor of racial preferences			0
' that fact makes it hard to predict how @entity21 will address this plan , ' said @entity77			0
' if any plan would satisfy @entity21 , it would seem that this one would because the university formulated its plan to meet the specific objections that @entity21 had to the @entity187 affirmative action plan			0
' the @entity19 - where @entity13 claims that she was denied a place due to affirmative action justice @entity190 will not participate in the case , because she dealt with it in her previous position as solicitor general			2
lawyers for @entity197 companies filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of the @entity19 , arguing that those who have been educated in a diverse setting are ' better equipped to understand a wider variety of consumer needs ' and are ' likely to generate a more positive work environment by decreasing incidents of discrimination and stereotyping			0
' even the @entity207 said in briefs , ' our student athletes , and all of the students who attend our institutions , receive the best education when they are able to interact with others within a university community that is broadly diverse across its entire scope			0
' filing on behalf of @entity13 , three members of the @entity218 point to empirical evidence that they said shows that race - preferential admissions policies do more harm than good			1
' if this research is right , ' argued lawyers for commission members @entity226 , @entity227 and @entity228 , @entity13 eventually took up a place at @entity14 ' we now have fewer minority science and engineering graduates than we would have under race - neutral admissions policies			1
' there are six states that have laws banning the use of affirmative action in public universities ( @entity241 , @entity187 , @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity245 , according to the @entity246 )			2
the @entity247 has filed a brief arguing that its inability to consider race has hurt the school 's diversity			0
the university said it has experimented with different strategies to address underreprestend minority student populations , but that these measures have enjoyed only ' limited success , ' and that the school , particularly , in its most highly ranked campuses , has not been able to reverse a decline in minority admissions and enrollment			2
a decision in the current case , likely to come down sometime in early 2012 , could have implications for private institutions that receive federal funding , as well as hiring decisions in public institutions .			0

in 1997 , the @entity1 legislature passed the ' @entity98 , ' which mandates that @entity1 high school seniors in the top 10 percent of their class be automatically admitted to any @entity1 state university
@entity13 did not qualify for automatic admission , and was forced to compete with other non-top - 10 - percent state applicants
she said she was denied admission , even though her academic credentials exceeded those of some of the admitted minority candidates
if @entity13 wins , race - conscious admissions policies at public universities may be thrown in doubt across the @entity128
