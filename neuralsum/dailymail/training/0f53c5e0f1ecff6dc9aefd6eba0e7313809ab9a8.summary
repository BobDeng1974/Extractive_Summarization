' to hell and back ' : @entity1 has turned her life around ... but fears reprisals after going public the woman at the centre of the prince @entity7 under - age sex scandal was forced to flee her home and ‘ fears for her life ’ , her aunt claimed last night			1
@entity1 , 31 , sparked headlines around the globe when she filed sensational court papers claiming she slept with the @entity7 three times , including as a juvenile of 17 under @entity18 law , while working as a teen ‘ sex slave ’ for convicted paedophile @entity21			1
last night @entity23 ’s aunt @entity22 , a devout mormon who helped raise her , spoke for the first time to tell how terrified @entity23 fled her @entity18 home several months ago amid fears of reprisals from billionaire @entity21 and his rich and powerful friends			1
‘ she knew these court papers were coming out so she packed up and fled , ’ @entity22 said			1
‘ she is frightened for her life			2
she has angered a lot of powerful and very rich people			1
who knows what they could do ? ’ @entity22 , the sister of @entity23 ’s father @entity38 , said her niece is now living in a ranch ‘ in the middle of nowhere ’ in @entity41 with her husband and three young children			2
‘ she does n’t feel safe , ’ retired teacher @entity22 added			2
‘ there are too many powerful people involved and she is saying things they do n’t want made public			1
‘ @entity23 was living a happy life in @entity18 but she packed up and left because she knew this was coming and was scared for her own life and that of her family			1
‘ just before she left she told me she would n’t be able to contact any family members for a while – for our own safety			1
she said , “ it ’s for the best			2
i do n’t want to put anyone in danger			2
” ’ @entity22 says she has ‘ no reason not to believe ’ her niece ’s claims she slept with prince @entity7 three times , in @entity66 , @entity67 and the @entity68 – accusations the @entity7 vehemently denies			1
and asked about claims that @entity23 , who is writing a book of her story , was a fantasist out to profit from the scandal , @entity22 said : ‘ @entity23 is not a fantasist , i do n’t believe this is about the money			2
’ despite the headlines , little is known about the woman at the heart of the scandal			2
the @entity82 has spoken to members of @entity23 ’s family and close friends and has unearthed court papers which reveal a heartbreaking tale of a ‘ good @entity89 girl ’ whose life spiralled out of control after she was repeatedly sexually assaulted by older men at a young age			1
it is a cautionary saga , according to her aunt , ‘ of how things can go real bad , real quickly ’			2
‘ my niece went to hell and back , ’ she said			2
@entity23 was born in 1983 to @entity102 , an odd - job man and ‘ horse - loving cowboy ’ , and @entity105 , a bank worker who already had a two - year - old son @entity106 from a previous marriage			0
the family lived in @entity109 , @entity110 but moved to @entity111 in @entity112 , @entity18 , when @entity23 was just four years old			1
another aunt , @entity113 , said yesterday : ‘ the family was n’t wealthy but @entity105 came from money and @entity23 was given a trust fund by her maternal grandmother			2
' @entity105 ’s mother took the family on lavish holidays when @entity23 was a child			0
she was brought up with good morals ; respect your parents , do n’t talk back , do n’t drink or do drugs			0
’ but while @entity23 ’s early years on her father ’s small ranch were ‘ idyllic ’ according to aunt @entity22 , everything changed when she was 12 and was molested by a family friend : ‘ he said he needed to send @entity23 to live with me			2
of course i said yes immediately			0
' @entity22 , who was then living in @entity132 , @entity110 , added : ‘ i ’m a @entity133			0
i do n’t drink , smoke or drink caffeine			0
' she was very quiet and had an eating disorder			0
she ’d have a piece of lettuce and say she ’d eaten			0
if your world feels out of control the one part of your life you can control is what you eat			0
’ @entity23 returned to live with her parents after a year when the molester , a neighbour , moved out of the area			0
but when she returned to @entity18 , @entity23 , then 13 , went off the rails			1
family ties : a snap of @entity1 , left , with her aunt @entity155			1
@entity22 says she has ‘ no reason not to believe ’ her niece ’s claims she slept with @entity7 three times - accusations the @entity7 vehemently denies in an interview with @entity82 in 2011 , @entity23 said the fallout from the molestation caused her parents to temporarily split			1
she admitted living on the streets where she was ‘ beaten up ’ and slept with at least two older men in return for food : ‘ i was a paedophile ’s dream , ’ she said			1
the @entity82 has now seen court papers showing transcript of a telephone conversation with lawyer in which @entity23 said : ‘ a close family friend has sexually abused me and i was on the streets at 13			1
' i was picked up by a 67 - year - old man who did exactly what @entity21 did with me , abuse and violate my youthfulness and i was with him for six months			1
’ @entity82 has chosen not to name the man who , we believe , is now dead			0
@entity22 said she did n’t know what happened , adding : ‘ i am not saying that does n’t make it true			0
i believe what @entity23 says			0
’ other friends from that time say @entity23 sank into drug addiction			2
one said : ‘ she smoked weed and did n’t spend a lot of time at school			0
her elder brother @entity106 took her to rehab aged just 15 or 16			0
@entity23 was definitely troubled , but she would n’t speak about her demons with anyone – she just kept it bottled up			0
’ ' thrilled ' : @entity22 said @entity23 's family was excited when she showed them this 2001 photograph of prince @entity7 with his arm around her at 15 , @entity23 ’s world changed when she met @entity202 , the - then girlfriend of billionaire @entity21			1
@entity23 ’s father was a maintenance man at @entity204 , @entity205 ’s luxury hotel in @entity112 , @entity18 ; his daughter folded towels at the pool			1
@entity202 , @entity23 has said in court papers , recruited her into @entity21 ’s harem of young ‘ masseuses ’ whose primary job was to satisfy the financier ’s twisted sexual fantasies			1
however @entity202 , the daughter of press baron @entity215 , has branded such claims against her as ‘ untrue ’ and ‘ obvious lies ’			0
an old friend of @entity23 ’s recalled : ‘ we had our doubts about why exactly @entity21 had picked this young girl to be his favourite masseuse , when she did n’t know much about it , especially when he started flying her around the world			1
but she did n’t say anything about the abuse until much later			0
‘ once she ’d told her boyfriend at the time the truth they then decided she should n’t work there any longer			2
but @entity21 wanted her there and was used to getting his way			1
he lured her back and told her she would n’t have to do so much of the sexual stuff if she could bring in other girls from school			2
’ this had been @entity21 ’s modus operandi for years : encouraging girls to bring in more girls to feed his perverted desires			1
it was described by one lawyer as a ‘ pyramid of sexual abuse ’			0
@entity23 ’s family say they were ‘ stunned ’ when they learned she had been passed around as a sex toy			2
@entity22 said : ‘ how she got seduced into @entity21 ’s world i do n’t know			1
i ca n’t get inside @entity23 ’s head to know what made her vulnerable to @entity21			1
' they were really good at what they did and they were able to accomplish what they accomplished			0
‘ my brother thought it was all very legitimate			0
when @entity23 told us she ’d met prince @entity7 we were thrilled			1
@entity23 gave my @entity264 a copy of the picture of @entity7 with his arm around her – the picture which has now been seen around the world			1
at the time my reaction was “ wow , how neat ! ” i could n’t believe @entity23 had met prince @entity7			1
‘ all i would say now is that anyone – anyone – who abuses young people deserves to be prosecuted			0
’ while still in @entity21 ’s orbit , @entity23 was also working at the @entity276 , a burger bar in @entity112 , when she was accused of stealing just over £ 200 from her employer			1
however , @entity22 said : ‘ i never even knew she worked in a burger place			0
’ very soon afterwards , at the age of 19 , @entity23 went to @entity282 to take a massage course and fell in love with @entity287 martial arts expert @entity285			0
they wed within ten days of meeting			0
@entity22 says : ‘ she met @entity285 and turned her life around			0
‘ it breaks my heart that i have n’t been able to speak to her since this blew up but it ’s her choice			0
‘ she knows what she is up against , we do n’t			0
i fear for her , but i also admire her			0
she ’s a strong girl and she will get through this			0
