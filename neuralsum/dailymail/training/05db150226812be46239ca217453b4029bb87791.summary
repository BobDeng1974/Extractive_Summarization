thousands of people flocked to @entity2 's @entity1 on sunday for a spectacular celebration of the famous landmark 's 75th birthday			0
but a less cheery presence at the festivities was this display of 1,558 shoes representing those who have killed themselves by jumping off the bridge into the @entity12			1
the moving installation was the work of the @entity15 , an organisation dedicated to stopping suicide jumps from the bridge			1
' it 's a symbol of how deep and serious this problem has been , ' said spokesman @entity20			0
' we 're still losing 30 to 35 a people a year off the bridge			1
' poignant : these 1,558 pairs of shoes represent all the people who have committed suicide by throwing themselves off the @entity1 moving : the shoes were installed by the @entity15 , which pushes to cut down on the number of suicides at the bridge the day - long party attracted pleasure boats , tug boats and other vessels to the waterfront ahead of a magnificent evening fireworks display			1
crowds gathered for the exciting events taking place along the shoreline from @entity41 , south of the bridge , to @entity43 along @entity44			1
many walked and biked across the 1.7 - mile - long bridge bridge before rounding off the day by watching the nighttime show over the city 's enduring symbol			2
memorable sight : fireworks explode over the @entity1 as of its 75th anniversary celebrations draw to a close glittering vision : one of the modern @entity57 , the 1.7 - mile - long bridge opened to traffic on may 27 , 1937 the bridge was shrouded in fog for part of the day , but skies were clear by twilight for the 18 minute - long display , which coincided with @entity65 weekend			1
' it 's such an iconic structure , depending on the day or the hour , it just looks like it changes continuously , ' said @entity2 resident @entity67 as he walked through the @entity41 area with his wife and their three young children			0
since it opened in 1937 , more than 2billion vehicles have crossed the mammoth structure			1
the imposing tourist attraction was named after the @entity76 , the entrance of water to @entity12 from the @entity79 , which was championed by engineer @entity80 in the 1920s			0
dazzling : the steel suspension bridge was bathed in colour and pleasure boats and tugs encircled the water beneath arches of light : the @entity2 landmark is illuminated by the beautiful display as thousands watch from the city 's shore hotspot : tourists collect at the famous orange vermilion location on the day of its 75th anniversary celebrations the bridge , which rises majestically above a @entity100 - era fort on the @entity2 side and arches across to the @entity104 headlands to the north , is in the middle of a seismic upgrade that has seen many of its structures replaced or modified			1
plans for a moveable barrier to separate north and southbound traffic and a net system to prevent suicides are also moving forward			2
on the water , @entity76 ferries were running again after a one - day strike disrupted service across @entity12 on saturday			0
workers represented by the @entity122 's @entity121 walked off the job on a day strike , forcing the cancellation of ferries operated by @entity76 between @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity2			0
the strike was called after nearly a year of negotiations over workloads and other complaints , according to @entity132 , the union 's regional director			0
burning our bridges : the attraction , which is undergoing major refitting work to extend its lifespan by another 150 years , looked as though it were on fire riot of colour : eye - catching rockets flew into the air and crackled outwards from the bridge over @entity12 shimmering delight : the water was bathed in gold and scarlet as the 18 - minute extravaganza brought a day - long party to an end @entity153 governor @entity152 issued a statement on saturday evening , saying that he was appointing a board to investigate the strike , which he said had disrupted public service			1
ms @entity132 disputed the governor 's claim , questioning the motivation to call for an investigation after a one - day strike and saying : ' [ this is ] an action to try to silence us			0
' they 're counting on this process to back our membership off the issue			0
' service resumed sunday when workers returned to work			0
the bridge was built as the @entity174 emerged from the @entity175 , and was heralded as an engineering marvel when it opened in 1937			1
now an iconic sight , it was the world 's longest suspension span at the time , built across a strait that critics said was too treacherous to be bridged			0
illustrious history : the bridge was built as the @entity174 emerged from the @entity175 , and was heralded as an engineering marvel when it opened in 1937 incredible feat : the tourist attraction was the world 's longest suspension span at the time , built across a strait that critics said was too treacherous to be bridged crews had to install a bracing system after high winds lashed and twisted the span in the 1950s , raising fears it would collapse			1
years later , they had to replace vertical cables when they were found to have corroded in the bridge 's damp , foggy climate , potentially destabilising the span			2
' when ( one of the bridge 's designers ) made his final speech during opening day ceremonies in 1937 , he said , " i present to you a bridge that will last forever , " ' said @entity209 , the bridge 's former chief engineer , who co-authored a book about the span			1
' what he should have said is , " i present to you a bridge that will last forever if properly maintained			2
" ' eleven men died during construction from 1933 to 1937 - ten of them when scaffolding fell through a safety net that had been set up to protect workers			2
the conditions were difficult , cold , foggy and windy , and workers who helped construct supports for the south tower had to contend with dangerous tides			0
the current retrofit project is expected to extend the bridge 's lifespan by another 150 years .			2

@entity15 *erected* a moving display of 1,558 pairs of shoes to represent those who have jumped from the bridge to their death
@entity235 was heralded as engineering marvel when it opened in 1937 as the @entity175 came to an end
