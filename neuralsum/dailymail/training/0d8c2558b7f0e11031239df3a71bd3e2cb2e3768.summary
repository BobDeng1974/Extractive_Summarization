a well - preserved human forearm that was once displayed near the @entity1 as ' the arm of the unknown soldier ' is now grabbing the @entity5 spotlight at the @entity6			1
officials at the @entity8 , @entity9 , museum call the naturally mummified relic the highlight of their first ' behind the @entity14 ' @entity5 tour of the facility - a 19th century embalming parlor that they dub ' the most haunted building in @entity8			1
' but they also insist it 's not just a marketing gimmick			0
' we do n't want it to be a scary @entity5 prop , ' said curator @entity25			0
' this is the arm of a 16 - year - old boy who probably died on the battlefield			1
' mystery : @entity31 anthropologists who examined the limb for the @entity8 museum were unable to authenticate it as a battlefield relic the @entity37 museum is exhibiting the limb as an example of a typical wound from the clash near @entity41 on sept. , 1862 , that left about 23,000 soldiers dead , wounded or missing on the bloodiest day of the @entity37			1
the forearm 's skin and tendons appear to have been violently twisted , making it unlikely that the arm was surgically amputated			1
' medical specimens are n't torn off of bodies , ' said @entity25 said			0
however , it 's far from certain the arm was torn off in battle			2
@entity31 anthropologists who examined the limb for the @entity8 museum were unable to authenticate it as a battlefield relic			2
they say it belonged to an unidentified white male of about 16 - five or six years younger than the average soldier - who probably hailed from @entity60 , @entity61 or @entity62 , based on forensic evidence of his diet			2
there is a smaller possibility he was from the local area , the researchers found			0
research : anthropologist say it belonged to an unidentified white male of about 16 - who probably hailed from @entity60 , @entity61 or @entity62 , based on forensic evidence of his diet ' the authenticity of the arm as a @entity37 relic is highly questionable due to inconsistencies in its collection record with evidence from the analysis , historic documentation , and interviews with local residents , ' @entity74 and @entity75 of the @entity31 's @entity76 wrote in their report			1
the muddy - looking arm was donated anonymously to the museum in 2012 after decades on display at a roadside museum in @entity41			1
the limb purportedly was found two weeks after the battle by a farmer who was said to have pickled it in brine before giving it to a local physician , who supposedly preserved it with embalming fluid			1
but researchers found no evidence of chemical preservation			0
rather , the arm appears to have dried out naturally , either in the open air or under a light soil cover - like the shallow graves in which those slain in battle were hurriedly buried before their remains were moved to the @entity113			1
' it is possible that the arm was uncovered during this process			2
it seems unlikely however , that it would have remained unplaced in a grave , ' the @entity31 anthropologists wrote			0
researchers also could n't verify that the limb was ever in the possession of a local doctor			2
they cited another account that it was found on the battlefield around 1900 by a local patent medicine dealer named @entity128 or @entity129			0
human remains have been found at @entity1 as recently as 2009			0
whatever its origin , the limb deserves respectful treatment , @entity25 said			0
' i think as long as we are respectfully telling the story and using it as an opportunity for people to learn about it , i think we 're doing ok , ' she said .			0
