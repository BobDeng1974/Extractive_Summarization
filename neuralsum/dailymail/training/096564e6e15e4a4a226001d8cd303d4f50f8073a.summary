the former @entity0 has said he believes federal authorities are purposely leaking details of the @entity5 case because they already know that no charges are going to be brought against officer @entity7			1
@entity8 has claimed the controversial @entity10 article published last week which details a frantic struggle between 18 - year - old @entity5 and @entity7 over his weapon inside a squad car is all part of a strategy to ' let people down slowly '			1
the retired police chief says he believes federal authorities accept it is ' probably very unlikely ' that the grand jury will recommend no charges be brought against 28 - year - old @entity7 and he expects to see more leaks like this in the next few weeks			1
law enforcement , we know that about half the officers killed every year with firearms are killed with their own , ' said @entity8 to @entity38			1
' so the fact that he did n't have his own does n't mean there was n't a weapon there available that could be used in deadly force use			0
' addressing the @entity10 article published last friday , which included leaks from the grand jury which is taking place in secret , @entity8 said he would call the sensational information phase two of the feds strategy			1
in other words , ' to coordinate leaks to the media , and to start getting some of the facts out there to kind of let people down gently , ' said @entity57 to @entity38			1
' when i say this is phase two â€“ phase one was really @entity59 's announcement how they were going to basically do a complete review and take over the @entity62			0
' ' self defense ' : @entity30 police officer @entity7 says he feared for his life as he shot @entity5 @entity57 said in his own opinion , physical evidence is preferable to eye - witness evidence			1
' physical evidence has no reason to lie			0
it does n't see things differently , ' he said to @entity38			2
' if there was a struggle inside that car over a firearm , it sounds to me like officer @entity7 would have been justified in taking the action he did if he pulled the trigger and actually shot @entity5 in the vehicle area			2
' taking the logic of a police officer to what he feels is the necessary conclusion , @entity8 explained how he thinks the grand jury will see the most controversial part of the death of @entity5 - his fatal shooting while holding his hands aloft in surrender outside of the car			1
however , @entity57 claims that if the grand jury leans towards what @entity7 claims - that @entity5 was charging him when he opened fire - they will have no chance but to leave him uncharged			1
' if @entity5 was truly turned around and basically charging the officer , he already went for round one fighting over his handgun			0
are you going to go for round two and take the chance of losing it this time ? ' @entity8 said to @entity38			1
struggle : according to @entity110 analysis @entity5 's blood was found inside officer @entity7 's patrol car			1
the cop claims he wrestled with @entity5 in the car and was in fear of his life			0
but the account is disputed ' i think that would be a more logical explanation as to why officer @entity7 would have discharged his firearm at @entity5			2
' @entity8 then said that police officers have a lawful authority to apply force and they are under no obligation to retreat			2
indeed , @entity8 said he fully expects to see more leaks ove the coming weeks			2
according to those in @entity30 who have been in @entity30 during the protests and racial unrests following the shooting , they are concerned about the grand jury result now			1
' if there is not an indictment , excuse my @entity136 , all hell is going to break loose , ' one protester told @entity138			0
@entity139 , the attorney for @entity5 's parents , told @entity141 on saturday that the officer 's account of what happened was ' self - serving			0
' ' the officer is going to say whatever he has to say to try to justify killing an unarmed teenager , ' @entity139 said			0
' and certainly , his statement should not be taken above independent eye witnesses who are completely unbiased when he has every reason to be biased			0
' @entity139 also said that because there were reports that @entity5 was shot while he ran away , it ' does n't matter ' what happened in the car beforehand			0
' he was definitely not in fear of threat when @entity5 was running away from him , ' @entity139 said			0
solidarity : protesters are pictured here in @entity30 monday night continuing a vigil for @entity5 tensions : police officers watch over the residents who have taken to the streets again , more than two months after the shooting memorial : neighbors wait by a memorial set up on @entity170 , @entity171 - the spot where @entity5 was killed the @entity10 reported that @entity7 has told investigators that he was trying to leave his suv when @entity5 pushed him back in and that once inside the vehicle the two began to fight			2
@entity7 told authorities that @entity5 punched and scratched him repeatedly , leaving swelling on his face and cuts on his neck , the @entity10 reported			2
@entity7 , who had been patrolling @entity30 for nearly three years , was placed on leave after the shooting			2
a state grand jury is considering charges against him			1
@entity7 is being represented by @entity185 , general counsel for the @entity186 and a former general counsel for the @entity38 @entity188			1
@entity185 did n't immediately respond to an email saturday seeking comment , and his work phone system was n't accepting voicemail			0
the @entity193 is investigating the @entity62 for possible civil rights violations , including whether officers there use excessive force and engage in discriminatory practices			0
two - thirds of @entity30 's 21,000 residents are black but only three of its more than 50 police officers are black			0
@entity204 , a spokesman for @entity0 , which has taken control of @entity30 security , said in an email that the department does n't comment on active investigations .			0
