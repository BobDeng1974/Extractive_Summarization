by @entity0 tonight is the start of the new series of made in @entity3			1
it ’s now been nearly three years since we started out ( june 2011 , to be precise ) and this is the seventh series of the programme documenting the lives and loves of a set of young people who live in an around @entity12			2
i think it ’s safe to say that none of the original cast thought it would last this long when we started			2
@entity0 in series one of made in @entity3 , the seventh series starts tonight on @entity19 i ’ve certainly gone through a major transition since the start of our tv journey			1
now older ( obviously ) and wiser ( possibly ) - i 've been through four girlfriends , countless rows , and one slap			2
physically there 's been some big changes from the fresh faced lad above - i ’m about a stone and - a - half lighter than my series one self , thanks to work out sessions at @entity35 gym and @entity37 supplements			1
by series two i ’d realised that tv adds a considerable amount of weight to you , and i went in for a style - re - vamp - chopping off the long - hair , and beard			2
@entity0 has made a few life style changes since series one and is now a stone and a half lighter it took me till series six to realise that me and relationships are n’t really working on - screen or off - so this time round i ’m single ( or at least trying to be )			1
no commitments , no ties - and therefore no problems with infidelity and no unpleasant moments with soon - to - be ex-girlfriends down by the @entity60			0
well , that 's the plan anyway			1
i ’ve already seen the first episode ( on @entity19 tonight 10pm ) at a screening last friday with all the cast and i do n't want to give the game away with any of the storyline but it is without a doubt the best series yet			1
@entity0 with the panel of 8 out of 10 cats - @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 made in @entity3 really is at the top of its game now			1
there ’s some great bon mots , some relationship issues ( thankfully not me this time ) and the occasional row thrown in for good measure			2
on the same night - by the magic of television - is my appearance on @entity86			0
for those not familiar with the show , it ’s a humourous panel programme about the news stories of the week and consumer surveys hosted by @entity73 , also featuring comedians @entity92 and @entity72			0
current affairs is not exactly my strong suit and these guys are more than capable of ripping you apart verbally if you trip up on any subject - so this looked like it could easily turn into a car crash for me			0
@entity0 on set of 8 out of 10 cats that will air tonight on @entity103 in the end , i think i held up quite well - or they were being gentle			1
conversations were totally random and ranged from my style tips to @entity108 ( he wanted to know how to create the perfect pocket square ) , why i bought @entity110 even though i ’m not a vegetarian			0
@entity112 later went off a total tangent and started talking about giving therapy to fruit and glory holes in public fences ( you ’ll have to watch it to make sense of it			0
we were nearing the end of filming the show and i thought i was home and dry and , in a school boy error , i took my eye off the ball			0
the final question was ' what would you like to know more about ? ' and the female guest comedian @entity132 said with heavy sarcasm that she would like to know more about @entity134 and what he did in his everyday home life			0
@entity0 had a toe - curlingly embarrassing experience on the panel i lost concentration at that moment and said , ' perhaps you should tune into @entity141 on @entity142			1
' @entity73 noticeably winced and said to the audience : ' i think that might be what she was getting at			0
' it was toe - curlingly embarrassing and i hope that the camera failed to record my epic tv fail			0
hopefully there wo n't be any epic fails for me in series seven of made in @entity3 - but i would n't bet on it			1
all the best , @entity152			0

made in @entity3 returns to our screens tonight on @entity19
