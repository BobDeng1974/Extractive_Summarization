@entity0 , 19 , from @entity1 , @entity2 , has had a fleet of cars worth more than £ 500,000 torched in two arson attacks in just five days a millionaire teenager has had four supercars worth more than £ 500,000 torched by arsonists in what he claims are a ' vile act of jealousy '			1
@entity0 , 19 , from @entity1 , @entity2 , who goes by the name ' @entity13 ' on the internet , had his flash @entity16 set alight last friday - just five days before three more of his super cars were destroyed by vandals			1
the teenager , whose runs a luxury car hire business in @entity23 with his father , said the culprits would be going down ' for a long time ' - and he would ' sit back and enjoy the show ' once they did			1
but the wealthy car fanatic - who has a number plate on one of his cars reading 1 @entity33 for ' lord ' - admitted the loss was not of a scale that he would ' lose any sleep over it '			1
he told @entity39 : ' i run a successful business and these people are just trying to ruin that			2
' i have not done anything to deserve this			0
i work hard and i give back to the community			0
people say i show off but i do n't			0
' if i wanted to show off , i could say ' i am the ones with all the car , who are you , you peasants ' , but i do n't say that			2
' it is not a loss on a scale where i am losing my sleep over it			0
but it 's just cowardly and i hope these people are found			0
' mr @entity0 's father @entity61 originally set up @entity62 , which offers @entity63 , @entity16 , @entity64 and @entity66 models for hire , in @entity68			1
now the teenager - who says his family runs by the motto that ' what 's my father 's is mine ' - also helps runs the business			1
he has more than 160,000 followers on the photo - sharing app @entity79 , where he dazzles his fans with pictures of his latest cars , and proclaims that he is ' not your average 19 - year - old lad '			1
he also posts photos of himself with his luxury cars on @entity88 , where his profile reads ' @entity90 '			1
but he says this prolific online presence - which he believes might have been a motive behind the attacks - is often taken in the wrong way			1
he said : ' i post those things because i want people to be motivated by my success			2
if they are motivated to succeed and say i was their motivation , then i have won			0
' even things like the name ' lord ' - it was just a stage name			2
people might not like it but i can call myself what i want			0
i wo n't let people call me that in person			0
' i have done nothing to upset people			0
the worst thing i have done is post some photos of some @entity16 but that 's not me being flash - they are just flash cars			1
i did n't buy one because why would i spend £ 20 buying a title when i have a number plate worth thousands with the name on it			1
' the car fanatic calls him ' lord @entity13 ' online but says he does not let people call him that in person the first arson attack took place after mr @entity0 hired out a new £ 340,000 @entity153 for a wedding on friday last week			1
but hours later , the car was set alight outside a house in @entity157 , @entity158 , by three hooded men			0

five days later , three more of his luxury cars , worth around £ 200,000 , were destroyed in a second attack close to the family business , which was also captured on @entity161			1
two @entity172 supercars and a @entity173 were parked in a hotel car park , near to where the company is building a new showroom , when the arson attack took place			2
speaking after the first attack , he said : ' i ’m not really in a great state of mind at the moment - i ’ve had half a million pounds worth of cars destroyed in the last few days			2
' i ’m not sure if its an attack on my family because they would have come directly after me or my family if that was the case			0
' however , i do believe it could be a vile act of jealousy towards my business or it could just be mindless vandals on an arson spree			2
' either way , one thing is for sure they will be caught and when they do i suggest you sit back and enjoy the show because they will be going down for a long time			1
mr @entity0 , who says he is passionate about cars , had hired out the car for a wedding when it was attacked by arsonists this cctv shows the moment that one of the supercars which the teenager had leased out from the family firm was doused in petrol and set alight by vandals the £ 340,000 @entity16 was damaged but mr @entity0 says he hopes to get it back on the road in the next four weeks he later told @entity39 : ' some people will work hard their entire lives and will never be able to have a super car - they might not even be able to get a car - and that 's not their fault			1
' but it does not mean you can go around doing things like this			0

when i was told about what happened i felt the ground beneath me move			0
' it has taken a lot of hard work and effort to get where we are and we can not take a loss of £ 340,000			0
' i thought it would be toast but the passenger seat and dashboard is damaged so hopefully we should be able to get it back onto the road within four weeks			0
