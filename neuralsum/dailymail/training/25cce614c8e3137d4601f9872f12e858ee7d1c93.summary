by @entity1 reporter last updated at 4:11 pm on 19th july 2011 playwright @entity2 and the @entity3 are among campaigners who have launched the first @entity6 challenge against library closures proposed by local authorities across the country			1
the campaigners , from the borough of @entity12 in north @entity13 , today asked a judge to declare decisions to close six ' treasured ' libraries in their area ' fundamentally flawed and unlawful '			1
the @entity12 case is expected to be followed in the near future by similar challenges to closures proposed by @entity23 and @entity24 county councils , and on the @entity25			1
@entity26 : playwright @entity2 , left , compare library closures to ' child abuse ' , while the @entity3 , right , have contributed towards legal costs @entity30 , @entity31 , the @entity3 and @entity32 are among those who have contributed to the @entity12 campaign costs			2
playwright @entity2 launched a scathing attack when he spoke at a church benefit to raise legal funds to save @entity39 library , one of the six under threat in @entity12			2
he compared the loss to ' child abuse '			2
applying for judicial review , @entity44 today argued on behalf of local residents that @entity12 council had failed to comply with its statutory duties when it decided to make the cuts last april			1
ms @entity50 told mr @entity51 , sitting at the @entity6 in @entity13 , that the pressure on local authorities to cut spending in the face of significant funding cuts by central government was no excuse			1
@entity12 had adopted ' a fundamentally flawed and unlawful approach to the making of savings in its budget ' by starting from the false premise that library closures were inevitable			0
the council had failed to comply with equality legislation and consult properly with local people before rejecting the possibility of retaining libraries through community - based projects , argued ms @entity50			1
there was a failure to assess local needs , in particular those of children attending local schools and nurseries , she claimed			0
from left : @entity30 , @entity79 of @entity31 and @entity80 , who have all also contributed to the campaign to save @entity12 's libraries ms @entity50 said the case was of some public importance			1
it was the first judicial review claim to examine the relationship between a local authority decision to close significant numbers of libraries and the duty to provide a comprehensive and efficient library service			1
' we say the council , and council officers , misdirected themselves as to the terms of the 1964 @entity96 , or unlawfully closed their minds and failed to give full and fair consideration to whether the way to provide a comprehensive library service might be by means of a joint arrangement with third sector groups and volunteers			0
' local residents packed the courtroom after demonstrating outside the @entity107			1
six of @entity12 's 12 libraries are facing closure - @entity39 , @entity110 , @entity111 and those at @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115			1
ms @entity50 told the judge that all were treasured by the local community			0
there had been some 330,000 visits to them in 2010 - 2011 and they had almost 12,000 ' active users '			0
@entity12 council is arguing that the decision of its executive on april 11 to order the closures was not tainted by legal error			1
council lawyers say in court documents the decision was ' rational , made with great care and was based on a full appreciation of the obligation to act within the law '			1
due regard was had to the @entity137 , and a careful equality impact assessment was carried out			0
@entity12 borough 's population of about 290,000 is the second ethnically most diverse in the country , with 130 languages spoken in the borough 's schools			0
outside court , novelist @entity145 was among dozens of campaigners protesting against the closures			0
she said libraries were needed more than ever in times of recession			1
' libraries are where the unemployed to go find out information about work , libraries are where people who 've just come into the country find information , libraries are needed more than ever when times are hard , ' said @entity145 , who lives near @entity39 library			2
she asked : ' where do teenagers go to study if they ca n't find peace and quiet at home ? where do they find information if they do n't have computers ? they go to libraries			2
' i wrote two novels , @entity174 and @entity175 , in the @entity176			0
a lot of people making these decisions about closures probably owe a lot to libraries themselves			2
' they should be looking at cuts in management costs not closing libraries and front - line library staff			2
' public pressure : a campaigner holds a banner outside @entity193 a spokesman for the @entity196 campaign added : ' this decision has been taken despite massive opposition by residents who want to see those libraries remain open as a valuable resource for the whole community			1
' @entity203 , one of the campaigners bringing the judicial review claim , said : ' the threatened libraries are important for everyone who lives , studies or works locally , but especially for low income families and their children			1
' she said the proposed cuts , ordered by the council 's executive committee in april , ' make no sense legally or otherwise '			0
@entity216 , of @entity217 , the solicitors representing the campaigners , said : ' @entity12 sought to characterise its proposals as a " transformation " of library services			0
' but in reality it has simply swung a wrecking ball through local services with little regard to the consequences for those who use them			0
' the government has faced criticism from the author @entity234 over its refusal to intervene in library closures around the country			0
she said there had been ' a catastrophic failure of leadership ' from the @entity242 , the @entity243 and the @entity244 ( @entity244 )			0
a @entity244 spokesman said : ' we continue to monitor and assess proposals and decisions being made about changes to library services across @entity251			0
' we take very seriously compliance by local authorities with their statutory duty to understand the local needs for library services and to provide a comprehensive and efficient service to match that need			0
