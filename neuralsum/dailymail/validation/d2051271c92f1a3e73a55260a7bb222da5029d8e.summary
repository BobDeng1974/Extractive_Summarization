' luckily i was fine and managed to beat the tumour once again			0
but the operation made me realise that life can be short			0
' mr @entity6 , from @entity40 , @entity41 , appeared to be a healthy toddler until , at the age of three , he began suffering dizzy spells and falling over unexpectedly			1
after his worried mother took him to see their family doctor , her son was referred to @entity50 where specialists diagnosed a brain tumour			2
brain surgeons at @entity23 were able to remove most of the tumour , but were unable to take out parts that were close to mr @entity6 's motor neurons - the essential circuits that connect the brain to the muscles			1
mr @entity6 remembered : ' when they discovered the tumour i was still really young but i remember being in the hospital and being confused by it all			1
' i recovered quickly from the operation and managed to start school but that 's when the problems started			2
' initially people did n't say anything about my scars but then people kept coming up to me and asking what happened to my head			0
' they began to notice the tumour had given me a limp and i had lost movement in my left wrist			0

despite the success of mr @entity6 's first operation , his symptoms soon returned and he was forced to undergo a second operation at the age of six to again remove his brain tumour recovery : mr @entity6 aged six , following his second operation			1
he remained cancer free for the next 13 years until he enrolled at @entity7 , when the familiar symptoms began to reappear with the same symptoms reappearing just a couple of years after his first fight with the tumour , a new mri scan showed mr @entity6 's tumour had regrown			1
aged just six , he was once again forced to go under the surgeon 's knife for a risky operation to remove the growth and save his life			2
again he recovered and returned to school			0
but this time he fell victim to cruel classroom bullies who dubbed him ' tumour boy '			0

but when he enrolled at @entity118 to begin his degree , all - too - familiar symptoms began to return			0
' i started studying social work and the beginning of it was great until i started to get headaches			0
' one day when i woke up early to go on a trip and i fainted in my room and woke up three hours later			0
' it was then that i realised that something was n't right and i went to the hospital to get some checks done			0
' just a day after his 19th birthday , @entity6 received the devastating news he would have to battle the life - threatening disease for a third time			2
' i was now old enough to fully understand what was going on and i was so scared going into the operation , ' he said			0
@entity137 , a professor of @entity138 at @entity139 , said : ' it is possible that some brain tumours may return some time after they were first treated			0
