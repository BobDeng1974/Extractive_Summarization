it 's been quite a week for 21 - year - old @entity1			1
on saturday , he made his @entity5 first - team debut with a late cameo in the 2 - 1 win over @entity8 and then on monday he capped a commanding performance as captain of the under 21 side with a towering , last - minute header to beat @entity13			1
but who is the latest exciting prospect to roll off the prestigious @entity5 production line ? @entity1 made his debut for @entity5 's first team in a late cameo during the 2 - 1 win over @entity8 name : @entity1 age : 21 club : @entity5 position : centre - back why all the fuss ? not many players can say they 've played in front of 76,000 at @entity29 and 1,600 at @entity31 's @entity30 within the space of three days , but @entity1 impressed in both of these very contrasting arenas			1
the 21 - year - old was thrown on by @entity35 for his @entity5 first - team debut as they went backs - to - the - wall with 10 men to prevent @entity8 stealing a stoppage time equaliser			1
@entity1 may have only been on the field for a few minutes but @entity5 got the job done , holding on for three precious points to alleviate the pressure on the @entity45			2
@entity1 replaced @entity46 as @entity5 shored up their defence to hold on to the win over @entity8 48 hours later and @entity1 was back to his day job as @entity5 's under 21 skipper as they beat @entity13 thanks to a late flurry of goals on a foggy night in @entity55			1
@entity56 was the undoubted star attraction for those who turned out - and scored a spectacular free - kick - but the contribution of @entity1 was certainly worthy of note			2
he was rock solid at the back as goalkeeper @entity64 was seldom troubled and he showed tremendous presence in the air to power home a header from @entity56 's corner to settle the match 2 - 1 in @entity5 's favour			1
his goal was enough to send @entity5 top of the @entity74 too , ending a nice afterword to the extraordinary story of his weekend			0
@entity1 celebrates his winner for @entity5 's under 21s against @entity13 on monday night his goal took @entity5 to the top of the @entity74 21 @entity74 with @entity5 in the grip of an injury crisis , particularly at centre - half , @entity1 is likely to be again included in the squad for sunday 's home match with @entity86			1
it was @entity88 that started in that position against @entity8 but this weekend could see @entity1 's turn			2
he has waited patiently for his chance , a little longer than other members of the under 18 team he captained success in the 2011 @entity96			0
of that talented crop , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 all went on to make their first - team bows			2
but finally , at the age of 21 , it looks like @entity1 's time has come			2
@entity35 has not been afraid to play @entity5 's youngsters in the early weeks of the season what 's his background ? for someone so young , @entity1 has already achieved plenty			0
as well as that @entity96 triumph , in which @entity5 beat @entity118 6 - 3 on aggregate , he was a member of the @entity121 team that won the @entity122 back in 2010			1
hailing from @entity123 and a lifelong @entity5 fan , @entity1 joined @entity5 's academy at the age of 16 in july 2009 having already made half - a - dozen appearances for the club 's under 18 side			1
he got his first taste of success in a red shirt as part of the under 17 team that retained the @entity135 in @entity136 in 2009			0
his presence at the back is shown by the fact @entity5 conceded just two goals as they progressed through the tournament , beating @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity118			0
@entity1 lifts the @entity96 after @entity5 's win over @entity118 in the 2011 final the summer of 2010 saw the defender sign his first professional contract and , after impressing in the youth team 's eight - match unbeaten run from the beginning of the following campaign , he was elevated to the reserves			1
his debut at that level came on september 27 , 2010 against @entity158 and he scored his first goal for them against @entity161 on november 2			0
the season 's highlight , however , was @entity5 's run in the @entity96 which saw them defeat @entity165 , @entity8 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and then the @entity169 in the two - legged final			2
@entity1 had the honour of lifting the the @entity96 at @entity29 , the 10th time the club had won the competition			0
his performances earned a permanent place in the reserves squad for the 2011 - 2012 season and a maiden call - up to the first - team squad followed in late september , though he did n't take the field in @entity5 's @entity182 win over @entity183			1
the @entity5 team that lined up in the @entity96 third round tie with @entity165 at @entity186 in january 2011			0
( @entity187 - r : @entity97 , @entity188 , @entity1 , @entity101 , @entity189 and @entity99			0
front row l - r : @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity98 , @entity102 , @entity193 ) @entity1 spent some of the season out of position in midfield but he adapted admirably and was a central part of the team that won the @entity200 , beating rivals @entity201 2 - 0 in the final			1
more glory followed in 2012 - 2013 as he captained the reserves - now known as the @entity205 - to victory in the inaugural @entity74			0
they beat @entity13 3 - 2 in the @entity29 final and @entity1 had yet more silverware to add to his collection			2
last season saw @entity1 , as well as @entity97 and @entity212 , head to @entity201 for a spell on loan			0
unfortunately , he was n't able to gain the championship game time anticipated as an ankle ligament injury curtailed his time at @entity218			0
having recovered over the summer , @entity1 returned as under 21 captain and is now perhaps on the verge of a first - team breakthrough			1
@entity1 ( left ) and @entity101 pose with the @entity74 trophy in 2013 what about international honours ? @entity1 has played for @entity121 at every level from @entity226 to @entity205 and has also been entrusted with leadership responsibiltiies			2
as mentioned , he led the under 17s to victory in the 2010 euros , which were staged in @entity231 as they beat a very talented @entity234 side 2 - 1 in the final			1
his first @entity121 appearance had come in the @entity237 back in 2008 and he has played in midfield for his country on a number of occasions too			0
he captained the @entity242 to the semi-finals of the @entity244 in 2012			0
having emerged from a group containing @entity246 , @entity247 and @entity248 , @entity121 were beaten 2 - 1 by @entity249 in the last four of the competition staged in @entity251			1
@entity1 was a member of the @entity121 under 20s squad for the @entity253 in @entity254 last year but the team , led by @entity256 , were woeful and failed to win any of their three matches			1
he came on as a substitute to make his under 21 debut in @entity121 's 6 - 0 win over @entity261 at @entity262 in august 2013			1
@entity1 takes on @entity264 's @entity263 in the 2011 @entity96 semi-final at @entity29 what are his qualities ? the fact @entity1 has been handed the captain 's armband for both club and country demonstrates a maturity beyond his years and leadership abilities			0
he is vocal at the back and good at marhsalling and motivating his team - mates			0
@entity5 like to play the ball out from the back and @entity1 is always aware of opposition players in his vicinity to play the correct pass			2
as his header against @entity13 showed , @entity1 is powerful in the air , a useful attribute both at the back and from set - pieces going forward			1
his versatility in being able to play a central position both in defence and midfield is also an advantage			0
@entity1 tries to stop @entity167 's @entity292 in an @entity96 sixth round match at @entity294 in 2011 what happens now ? having gained a taste of life in the first - team , @entity1 will want more chances to show the @entity5 faithful what he can do			1
as long as @entity5 's defensive injury crisis continues , those opportunities could be there and @entity304 is clearly willing to give youngsters their chance			0
he will continue to captain the second - string and if he continues to turn in performances as he did on monday night , then those chances at a higher level should naturally emerge			0
