a @entity1 performer who penned a book about his experience of sexual abuse has been temporarily banned from publishing it because his ex-wife is worried their young son will read it			2
in a case which has been shrouded in secrecy , the woman , known only as @entity11 , successfully obtained an injunction to stop her ex-husband , known as @entity16 , publishing the book until the issue has been decided at trial			1
media lawyers and publishers have warned the case - known only as @entity23 v @entity16 - could set a dangerous precedent for freedom of expression and fear it could extend privacy laws ' by the back door '			1
a @entity1 performer who wrote about his experience of sexual abuse has been stopped from publishing his book after his wife sought an injunction from the @entity35 , the artist - said to be well - known in his performing arts field - argued that his right to freedom of expression was palpable because he had been the victim of such serious abuse as a schoolboy			1
but lawyers for his ex-wife claimed their son was particularly vulnerable and would be hugely disturbed if he ever read parts of his father 's work			1
in a further twist , the veil of secrecy covering the case means those involved can only be known by their initials			1
the artist 's exact trade can not be revealed either			1
the court even went to lengths to describe the woman and her son as living in ' @entity60 ' in order to conceal her identity			1
the performer told the @entity64 : ' imagine someone from @entity66 being told they ca n't come forward and talk about what happened to them as a result of legal action			0
' the startling case emerged after @entity11 brought proceedings on behalf of her son , who has @entity75 and attention deficit disorder			1
experts warn the case could have a devastating effect on freedom of expression for writers the case was brought to court under a historic case dating back to 1897 which established ' the intentional infliction of mental shock ' in common law			1
the court rejected @entity11 's claims that the information would be a ' misuse of private information ' or that the whole book should be banned			1
but it did grant a temporary injunction , ruling that the balance of the boy 's rights versus those of his father should be decided at full trial			1
@entity16 's solicitor @entity104 told the paper that the decision threatened to extend privacy law by the back door , adding that there could be ' serious implications '			2
and @entity111 , director of @entity112 , which campaigns for the rights of writers , told @entity115 : ' i think it is always worrying when a book is potentially banned			2
' we have to question very carefully the basis on which this is taking place			0
we do not expect this to happen in a democracy that has a very fundamental support for freedom of speech			1
' she added that it could be a slippery slope , allowing others to claim they are ' distressed ' by other people 's work			2
she said : ' if it is possible for an individual to stop a book being published , on the grounds it will cause distress to a family relative , you can imagine that it might be applied further to many other cases - particularly memoirs , or even fiction that might be based on real events and in which people can identify themselves			0
' it is incredibly rare for books to be banned			0
but what i can see as potentially happening is very worrying			2
when it happens we really have to examine and questions and resist			0
' @entity152 , chief executive of the campaign group @entity153 , said : ' what would concern us is the potential for this to be used by other people as a way of getting books censored on the grounds that it causes distress			0
' i think that leads a very wide area for interpretation			0
' she added that attempting to ban something from publication over the fear it could become readily - available on the internet also sets a dangerous precedent			1
the ' intentional infliction of mental distress ' was established in a famous @entity176 tort case called @entity177			2
@entity178 was the landlord of the @entity180 public house in @entity181			0
a regular customer of the public house , known as mr @entity183 , decided to play a practical joke on @entity178 's wife			2
when mr @entity178 went to see the races in @entity187 , he left his wife to manage the house			0
mr @entity183 approached mrs @entity190 and told her that her husband had been seriously injured in an accident - which was not true			0
mr @entity183 told mrs @entity190 that he had suffered two broken legs and that he was lying at @entity194 in @entity195			0
he told her that she should go to him and bring two pillows to carry him home			0
mrs @entity190 argued that the joke was a shock to her nervous system , causing her to vomit and her hair to turn white			0
the most famous example of a book threatening to be banned was in the case of @entity204			0
in 1988 , the @entity205 lost its long - running battle to stop the publication of the controversial book which was written by former secret service agent , @entity210			0
the court ruled the media could publish extracts from the former @entity216 officer 's memoirs , because any damage to national security had already been done by its publication abroad			1

the woman , known as @entity11 , said their son would be disturbed by extracts
court ruled issue should be heard at trial and *enforced* temporary injunction
none of the names of those involved , nor the man 's *job* , can be revealed
*judgment* referred to woman as living in ' @entity60 ' to conceal her identity
experts warn case could set dangerous precedent for freedom of expression
campaigners say it is worrying in democracy that supports freedom of speech
