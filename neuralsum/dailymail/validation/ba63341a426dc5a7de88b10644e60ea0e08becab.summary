these are testing times for @entity2			1
the embarrassment of the wooden spoon and a possible @entity6 whitewash await on saturday			1
yet , still , some have faith			0
after four straight @entity6 defeats , it may seem that he is a little detached from the reality of the situation but @entity15 , that most rugged of lock forwards , maintains this is a team on the verge of something special			1
the 32 - year - old , who has won 60 caps during his nine - year international career , is not one to take a backwards on the field of play			1
and he insists that , despite results , @entity25 's men are heading in the right direction			1
@entity2 lock @entity15 has won 60 caps for his country spanning a nine - year international career @entity31 will attempt to rack up both the win and tries needed at @entity34 on saturday afternoon to apply a significant dose of pressure to @entity38 rivals @entity37 before they take on @entity39 in the evening kick - off			1
but the man who @entity25 calls his ' great , old warrior ' was in no mood to take on the roll of cannon - fodder			1
and @entity15 , who has already experienced the pain of the wooden spoon in 2007 and 2012 , said : ' i understand the results are the most important thing , but we definitely have some players who can do something really special in the near future			1
' having had the experiences i have had playing for @entity2 and not having everything going our way and having to brush ourselves off in adversity , something good will come of the time we are going through just now i am sure			2
' this squad is in a very good place , more so than in most @entity6 i have been involved in despite the results			2
on paper , it does n't look like we 've done too well as we have n't won a game , but i think it is fair to say that we are definitely on the up			2
@entity15 insists @entity2 are heading in the right direction under @entity2 coach @entity25 ( above ) ' we have some fantastic players coming through			1
@entity72 was just 21 on saturday			0
then you have @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77			0
we are building an unbelievably good squad of players and we are playing some great stuff			0
' the biggest frustration is that in the past we have been the could - have , should - have , would - have side			2
but that will change under @entity25 with this group of players , no question			2
' i genuinely , genuinely believe in what i am doing and what he is doing otherwise i would not be working as hard as i am to be here and trying to get into the @entity2 team			2
' are we better than the wooden spoon this year ? yeah , we probably are			0
' if we beat @entity31 at the weekend , am i going to be happy with how we did in the @entity38 ? no. i want to win games			2
i 'm here to win @entity96			0
i am here to be part of a @entity2 successful team that will come good soon			2
' whether that is with me starting games , on the bench or in the squad helping the great young guys , i am determined to see it through as this team is heading in the right direction under @entity25			0
@entity15 cites young talent such as 21 - year - old lock @entity72 as reasons for optimism going forward ' i will stay here as long as i possibly can to help our fortunes change which they will			1
i genuinely believe it will happen soon and this team will do very , very well			0
' @entity15 's optimism is not based in fantasy			1
@entity2 have shown glimpses of what they can do — and , at times , their play has been a joy to behold			0
all they have to do now is execute @entity25 's game plan without making the silly mistakes that have cost them victory in at least three of their @entity6 matches thus far			1
' i genuinely believe winning is a habit we have simply got out off , ' said the big second row			0
' having played for @entity134 and for @entity135 in games where we are not playing that well but go on to win , we got used to winning			0
it 's a habit but losing is , as well			0
' we can change that habit against @entity31 and although we may go into it off some losses , we have positives to take from them			0
young flanker @entity74 ( right ) is another player who has shown plenty of promise in recent games ' for example , look at the @entity37 game when we lost early points but went in at half - time winning 13 - 10 — which just shows the maturity in what is a young squad			1
' also we are scoring some really exciting tries with some being fantastic , have n't they ? ' it is now all about bringing everything together now into a full 80 - minute performance			0
can we win the game against @entity31 at the weekend with what we 've got ? of course we can			1
' we have shown enough signs that we are good enough and provided we stop making naive mistakes , we can finish the @entity6 with a win and show how well this group of players is progressing .			0
