a male burqa - clad @entity1 militant has been arrested at the border between @entity4 and @entity5 after his unconvincing disguise failed to trick immigration officials			1
the tall , bearded man was spotted by @entity9 at the @entity11 checkpoint which separates @entity12 in @entity5 and @entity13 in @entity4			2
accompanied by another male militant , the man wore a brown burqa covering his face and body , over a blue collared shirt and a black salwar kameez , which is traditional @entity5 dress for men			1
the tall , bearded @entity1 militant failed to dupe @entity5 border officials at @entity11 with his ill - fitting burqa the burqa appeared too short for the militant , revealing his shoes , ankles and clothes underneath			1
he wore black men 's boots and underneath his veil the man had a full beard - which is deemed a religious requirement by the @entity1			2
the @entity1 militant was caught by @entity9 unsurprisingly , his outfit failed to dupe border police , who arrested him and took him to their headquarters in @entity42 , @entity12 province , east of @entity43			1
the man , who has not been named , was presented to the public in order to discourage others from attempting similar ploys to outsmart border police			0
he towered over the guards supervising him and his face remained obscured as the burqa was pulled up to reveal his beard			0
his companion , who wore traditional @entity5 men 's clothing , was also arrested and brought before the media while blindfolded and accompanied by armed guards			0
traditional @entity5 dress for women varies between regions and ethnicities and can be very colourful			0
but as burqas are full - length garments which cover most of the body , it is possible one of the reasons the militant was caught out was due to the fact that part of his burqa fell above the knee because of his height .			0

@entity1 militant wore an ill - fitting burqa in a *bid* to cross the @entity5 border
@entity9 caught militant and *hauled* him in front of local press
