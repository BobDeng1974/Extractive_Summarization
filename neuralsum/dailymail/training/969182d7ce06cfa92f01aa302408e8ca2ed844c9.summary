vice president @entity0 has spent more than a million dollars of taxpayers ' money taking weekend and day trips to his home in @entity5 , @entity6 , according a new book			1
dubbed the ' @entity8 ' by @entity10 agents and @entity11 on the vice president 's service , a new book by @entity16 bestselling author @entity15 alleges that @entity0 once made a same - day trip to and from @entity5 so he could play golf with the president			1
the recorded cost of that trip alone was $ 12,406 , @entity15 writes in a chapter of his not - yet - released book @entity24			1
' @entity25 ' : a new book claims vice president @entity0 , pictured here in april , uses air force two and @entity29 like a taxi service and wastes thousands of taxpayer dollars on unnecessary trips to and from his home in @entity5 , @entity6 the book , @entity24 , comes out on august 5 in @entity24 , @entity15 , an award winning investigative journalist , dishes on several of @entity0 's dirty little secrets , including his affinity for skinny dipping and for taking private trips on his taxpayer funded helicopter and plane ' as if taking a taxi			1
' @entity15 claims a @entity10 agent told him that every friday @entity0 takes the @entity29 helicopter to @entity48 in @entity49 , where he boards @entity28 and flies home to @entity6			1
he then retraces his steps and goes back to @entity53 at the end of the weekend			0
' the cost of the flights is doubled because after dropping him off in @entity6 or picking him up at @entity57 , the @entity11 has to fly the plane empty , ' @entity15 explains			2
@entity0 frequently makes same - day trips on the plane as well , a @entity10 agent reportedly told @entity15			1
' " the @entity11 two guys pull their hair out over this , " ' @entity15 quotes the agent as having said			0
one such same - day trip allegedly took place on friday , february 8 , 2013			0
@entity0 's official public schedule has him receiving the presidential daily briefing with president @entity70 at 10:30 a.m.and having lunch with @entity70 at 1 p.m. there 's nothing else on his schedule after that and no news reports documenting any public appearances from that day , suggesting that @entity0 may very well have been in @entity5 at some point			1
because @entity0 has to be on the flight for the @entity11 to pay for it , he will sometimes make the trip from @entity53 to @entity5 just to pick up his wife , dr. @entity82 , and take her back to @entity53 with him , a @entity10 agent told @entity15			1
@entity0 also schedules one - off events in @entity85 so he can take taxpayer funded trips to @entity85 to play golf with his family , the agent claimed			1
@entity15 says the @entity10 agent told him @entity0 's most eyebrow raising waste of government resources is when he travels to @entity5 then jets back to @entity57 the next morning to play a five - hour golf with @entity70			1
' " every three of four weeks when it 's warm , @entity0 gets up there on saturday and then will fly back on @entity28 , " @entity15 claims the agent told him			1
' " while air force two is sitting on the tarmac at @entity57 , he goes and plays golf with the president at @entity102 , gets back on the plane , and flies back to @entity6			0
' " let me tell you something , that is egregious , " ' he said			0
@entity15 alleges that he filed a @entity108 request in 2013 to get exact numbers on the dates of @entity0 's trips , how many times the @entity11 flew the plane empty to come pick @entity0 up or drop him off and the costs of travel			1
however , @entity0 's deputy counsel , @entity115 , instructed the @entity11 not to hand over the information to him , @entity15 claims			2
' " they are covering up , " ' @entity15 says an air force officer told him			0
' " we spent a lot of time compiling the records , but @entity0 's office said logs for each flight would have to be consulted			0
this is a smokescreen to delay providing any records as long as possible			0
" ' @entity15 called the vice president 's office 's actions ' unprecedented ' and contradictory to the president 's order that his administration should ' apply a presumption of openness ' in fulfilling such requests			0
' much like president @entity138 's cover - ups , it is an effort to direct government officials to hide personal abuse , ' he writes in @entity24			0
@entity15 says he eventually received the information he was seeking from the @entity11 and found out that @entity0 's trips to and from @entity6 from the start of his first term as vice president through march of 2013 cost $ 979,680			1
and that amount is only for the fuel and maintenance of air force two			0
it does not include the cost of fuel for @entity29 or the salaries of the helicopters crew			0
over the same time period , @entity15 says the @entity11 told him @entity0 flew back and forth from @entity5 to d.c. 225 times			1
those trips actually required a total of 400 flights , though , because of what @entity15 calls ' deadhead ' trips - return flights when @entity0 was not on the plane			2
the investigative journalist also found out that the total @entity28 costs from @entity0 's personal trips in fiscal year 2012 were $ 288,080 , and that an april 21 , 2012 , trip back to @entity57 to play golf with @entity70 cost the aforementioned $ 12,406			1
@entity15 's assertion is backed by similar reporting from long - time @entity171 reporter @entity170 last year			2
@entity170 estimated on his @entity173 blog that @entity0 's weekend trips were running taxpayers $ 13,200 just for the @entity28 flight costs			1
in his report on @entity0 's non-stop travel to @entity5 , @entity170 also questions the need for @entity0 to visit his home there so often			2
noting that @entity0 has family in @entity6 and is a regular at an exclusive golf course in the area , @entity170 points out that ' in an era of soaring debt ' @entity0 was choosing ' to spend thousands of taxpayers dollars to accomodate a personal predilection			2
' ' millions of @entity190 work in cities that they do n’t call home , but few can afford the expense of returning to their ancestral grounds regularly , ' @entity170 wrote			0
' and none can rest their heads on pillows at the beautiful vice president ’s mansion at the @entity202 in @entity53			0
' @entity15 says the irony of @entity0 's outrageous spending is that the president a put him in charge of the administration 's @entity207 to cut waste in 2011 and claimed @entity0 would ' hunt down and eliminate misspent tax dollars in every agency and department across the federal government			2
' @entity0 then told supporters of the administration in an email that he was the ' new sheriff in town , ' @entity15 noted			0
in @entity24 author @entity218 claims that @entity0 regularly travels to to @entity5 on friday , returns to the @entity53 area to play golf with president @entity70 on saturday , then flies back to @entity5 for the remainder of the weekend			1
the president and vice president are pictured here at the @entity224 on @entity225 in 2009 while @entity15 and the @entity10 agent he spoke with characterized @entity0 's gas guzzling golf trips with the president as occurring frequently , a report from @entity227 last month said the vice president had not played together for nearly a year			1
the last time @entity70 was known to have gotten together with @entity0 out on the green was in august of 2013 , @entity227 stated			0
furthermore , @entity0 has said multiple times throughout his vice presidency that he would prefer to take the cheaper , @entity235 train service between @entity5 and @entity53 like he did when he was a senator , but the @entity10 wo n't let him because it ' gives too many opportunities for people to interact with me in a way they would n't like to see			2
' it was only after last year 's budget cutting sequester that @entity0 was able to convince the @entity10 to allow him to take the train again			0
' i was able to say , " look guys , i 've got to take the train now -- it 's cheaper than flying			0
" so i get to take the train again , ' @entity0 said at a @entity248 of @entity250 's general event in february of 2013			0
still , @entity15 says , the onus is on @entity0 for taking so many trips on the taxpayer 's dime knowing just how much they were costing			2
' while @entity10 agents say flying is the most secure way for @entity0 to make the trips , the question is why the sheriff who is supposed to cut out government waste thinks it is appropriate to take such frequent trips for personal reasons , ' @entity15 writes in @entity24			1
likewise , the @entity10 agents and @entity11 officers assigned to @entity0 's detail ' express outrage at what they consider an abuse , ' he said .			0

@entity0 reportedly travels to his home in @entity5 , @entity6 , every weekend , according to @entity15 's new book , @entity24
sometimes @entity0 makes same day trips from @entity53 to @entity5 and back again to pick up his wife , @entity15 says
he also wastes money coming back to from @entity5 on the weekend to play golf with @entity70 and then going back to @entity5 again
one such trip cost a reported $ 12,406
