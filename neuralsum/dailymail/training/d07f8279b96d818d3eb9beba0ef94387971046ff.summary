scientists have said evidence which claimed to have unmasked @entity2 is wrong because a decimal point may have been put in the wrong place during calculations to match the killer 's delay with his descendants			1
dr @entity9 , a world - renowned expert in analysing genetic evidence from historical crime scenes , claimed to have found the identity of the notorious killer after he studied @entity15 on a shawl found near one of the murder victims			1
he extracted @entity15 from the shawl and was able to match it to descendants of the alleged killer , @entity23 , and one of the @entity2 's victims , @entity26 - ending more than a century of speculation			1
however scientists claim that dr @entity9 made an ' error of nomenclature ' in his analysis and therefore the 126 - year - old mystery of the killer 's identity still remains			1
in fact , they say , the sequence he found could be shared by the majority of the population and therefore can not be matched to @entity23 - one of the suspects in the string of murders which took place on @entity41 's streets more than 100 years ago - or the @entity2 's victim			1
@entity59 , a @entity60 immigrant , was believed to have been unmasked as @entity2			2
he was 23 when the murders took place , and living with his two brothers and a sister in @entity64 , just 200 yards from where the third victim , @entity65 , was killed			2
the revelation ended doubt over more than 100 suspects , which included queen @entity71 ’s grandson – prince @entity73 , the @entity74 – the post-impressionist painter @entity75 , and the former @entity77 prime minister @entity76			0
dr @entity9 , a molecular biologist at @entity79 @entity78 , started work on the case after he was contacted by businessman @entity82 , 48 , who bought a shawl at auction in 2007			0
it had been found next to @entity86 and was stained with what was believed to be her blood			0
experts claim errors in the analysis of the @entity15 mean that claims sequences are linked to those of @entity26 ( left ) , one of the @entity2 's victims , and suspect @entity23 ( right ) are wrong businessman @entity82 bought the shawl in 2007 and published the findings in naming @entity2 the scientist extracted six fragments of @entity15 from the shawl using a method called ‘ vacuuming ’ because the sample was so old			1
this involved using a pipette filled with a special ‘ buffering ’ liquid which removes the genetic material without damaging it			0
he then used the database at @entity113 to match one with one of her descendants , @entity117 , the three - times great - granddaughter of @entity26			0
another @entity15 fragment was matched to a descendant of @entity23 's sister who has asked not to be identify			2
there have been a number of suspects for the @entity2 murders , including @entity23 ( above ) a poster calling for the capture of @entity2 , which was published in the @entity127 in 1888 in a book published by mr @entity82 about the identity of the killer , dr @entity9 said the dna was a global private mutation ( @entity132 ) , which occurs at an incredibly rare frequency of 1/290,000			1
he said he calculated this using the database at @entity113			0
but experts say the mutation in question is actually 315.5c and not rare at all			2
it would have given a frequency of 1/29,000 at the time of dr @entity9 's analysis , as there were 29,000 entries on the database when he did his calculations in 2011			2
this suggests the decimal point was put in the wrong place , making the sequence far less rare , sir @entity151 , the inventor of genetic fingerprinting , told the @entity153			1
he said : ' if the match frequency really is 90 per cent plus , and not 1/290,000 , then obviously there is no significance whatsoever in the match between the shawl and @entity26 ' descendant , and the same match would have been seen with almost anyone who had handled the shawl over the years			0
' @entity163 , professor of forensic molecular biology at @entity164 and @entity165 , based at the @entity113 in @entity166 , have also raised concerns about dr @entity9 's study			0
a spokesman for the @entity170 , which published the book , said they are investigating the error and that the author stands by the conclusions made .			0

dna experts claim analysis which unmasked @entity2 was wrong
they have identified an ' error of nomenclature ' in scientist 's analysis of dna
error could be down to putting decimal point in wrong place , experts say
identity of notorious killer still a mystery 126 years after string of murders
