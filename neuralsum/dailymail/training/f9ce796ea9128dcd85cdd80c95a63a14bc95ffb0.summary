by @entity0 huge queues were building up at @entity3 this morning after half of all the immigration desks were shut - even though the @entity6 are just weeks away , it has emerged			1

yet more delays : official figures showed the wait at immigration control at @entity3 this morning were 56 minutes despite the 45 minute target ( file picture ) the queues do n't bode well for the huge numbers of people who will be coming through the airport in two weeks time for the @entity6 , as well as brits going and returning from their summer holidays			1
mr @entity7 's comments come after shadow home secretary @entity29 said it was a disgrace that international athletes were waiting longer than two hours to pass through immigration control			1
and , just last week chaotic scenes were photographed at the airport , with a sea of stressed passengers forced to wait in queues stretching half a mile to get through immigration control			1
the @entity38 , which represents 4,500 border staff , said at the time that the problems were made worse as only about half the current workers were fully trained to allow passengers from anywhere in the world entry			2
visit : @entity7 said he was appalled at the length of the queues at @entity3 this morning in april @entity8 published leaked figures showing 800 @entity49 posts have been cut in the past two years – 10 per cent of the total – with another 700 set to go by 2015			1
at the time , ministers said they would draft in more than 550 volunteers to help stem the chaos during the @entity6 , but they will receive just four days training on how to operate passport controls			0
mr @entity7 said : ' i was appalled by the length of queues in the immigration hall this morning			1
' it is now two months since the immigration minister promised additional resources and better management			2
' the worst aspect was that half of the immigration desks were simply not opened even though the @entity49 had prior knowledge of all flight arrivals			2
' this creates additional security pressures with luggage piling up in the baggage hall			0
we look forward to hearing the immigration minister ’s explanation for this tomorrow			2
' a @entity49 spokesman insisted mr @entity7 was incorrect			0
' queues at @entity78 remained under an hour at all times , ' he said			2
' @entity80 were quickly redeployed and more than 80 per cent of desks were open to process passengers as quickly as possible			0
' yesterday , ms @entity29 said many of those forced to wait in long queues were @entity86 athletes , who will be arriving ahead of the opening ceremony on july 27 to acclimatise to @entity89 conditions			1
a leaked memo reveals that tourists arriving from outside the @entity92 are repeatedly waiting longer than the 45 - minute target time to pass through passport control			1

ms @entity29 accused home secretary @entity99 of failing to ensure enough staff were employed at peak times			0
she added : ' these figures are a disgrace			0
with just three weeks to go until the @entity6 people are waiting more than two hours at @entity3 , and the targets for @entity78 have been breached on 26 of the last 30 days			2
' the home secretary ought to be able to make sure there are proper security checks without long queues			0
after all , there has been long enough to prepare for the @entity6			0
' instead , she has cut 900 @entity113 staff and these documents show there are still too few staff in place at peak times			0
' not happy : shadow home secretary @entity29 said it was a ' disgrace ' athletes had to wait while immigration minister @entity122 must explain why but mr @entity122 said the government ’s actions to tackle queues ' have resulted in real improvement over the last two months - including consistently hitting our targets on @entity89 and @entity130 passengers and reducing waiting times across the board '			1
' but we ’re not complacent about some long waiting times , which is why this weekend we have increased staffing numbers by more than 50 per cent at @entity3 to respond to large passengers volumes , ' he said			1
cuts : home secretary @entity99 has been criticised for cutting 900 @entity113 staff ' and by the start of peak @entity86 arrivals in less than 10 days , there will be up to 500 additional staff on our rotas across the country - this includes enough staff at @entity3 to cover every desk during busy times			2
' additionally we have special lanes in place designated to @entity86 athletes to enable them to pass through the border without delay			1
' despite the queues , @entity3 itself - which is not in charge of immigration - seems to be going to great lengths to welcome athletes arriving in the country			1
a series of @entity6 greeting desks manned by five members of staff have been rolled out across the airport			0
the airport is also recruiting 1,000 volunteers from local communities who , among other things , will wave off each flight leaving @entity3 after the @entity171			0

the airport expects to process 137,800 people leaving on that day , and 200,000 bags instead of an average of 150,000 on a normal day			0
a spokesman for airport operator @entity187 said : ' immigration waiting times for passengers during peak periods at @entity3 in the last few days have been unacceptably long and the @entity192 should be delivering a good experience for regular passengers as well as for @entity86 visitors			1
' he went on : ' immigration is a matter for the @entity192			0
