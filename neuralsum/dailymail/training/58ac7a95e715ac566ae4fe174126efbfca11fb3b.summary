@entity1 ’s pledge to force @entity3 surgeries to stay open seven days a week will be impossible to deliver without hiring thousands of new doctors , health experts said today			1
the prime minister said everyone would have access to a gp every day of the week by 2020 , with surgeries opening from 8am to 8pm			1
but doctors ' leaders warned that @entity12 were already stretched to breaking point because of staff shortages and @entity16 cuts			1
he said 12 hour surgery opening hours and weekend appointments were already in place for seven million patients after the launch last year of a £ 50 million fund in selected surgeries			1
the @entity18 annuonced a further £ 100 million to ensure that at least 10 million people are covered in 2015 , and a further £ 400million is earmarked to make the extended service nationwide over the five years following next may 's election			1
but dr @entity38 , a gp and spokesman for the @entity40 , said : ‘ gps are under huge pressure at the moment and we ca n't sustain the current service , let alone stretch it to a seven - day service , without significant extra funding and more importantly significant extra staff			1
’ under the government 's plan doctors will be required to band together so that they can take it in turns to open at weekends – giving all patients access to a gp on saturdays and sundays			1
mr @entity1 and health secretary @entity55 revealed the proposal – which will cost £ 400million over the next five years – at the @entity58 conference in @entity59 today			1
the reforms are a response to growing concern over the quality of out - of - hours care			0
@entity66 ’s 2004 contract allowed @entity12 to opt out of responsibility for patients outside office hours and at weekends			2
but while the plans will be welcomed by patients , doctors themselves are likely to warn that there simply are not enough staff to open at weekends and keep the level of service the same during the week			1
@entity1 ( left ) and health secretary @entity55 ( right ) will reveal the plans - which will cost £ 400million over the next five years - at the @entity58 conference in @entity59 there will also be concerns that practices will simply employ expensive locum @entity12 to cover the extra opening hours			1
as well as seven - day - a - week access and evening opening hours , mr @entity1 said family doctors will also be encouraged to try out services to suit modern lifestyles , such as greater use of @entity88 , email and phone consultations			2
they will also offer electronic prescriptions and online booking of appointments and registration			0
and every patient will be given a named gp responsible for their care outside hospital			0
the prime minister said : ‘ people need to be able to see their gp at a time that suits them and their family			0
that ’s why we will make sure everyone can see a gp seven days a week by 2020			0
‘ we will also support thousands more gp practices to stay open longer – giving millions of patients better access to their doctor			2
’ mr @entity1 first signalled the reforms last year , when he unveiled a £ 50million fund for 20 groups of @entity12 to develop ways to improve access for 7.5million patients			1
while the plans will be welcomed by patients , doctors themselves are likely to warn that there simply are not enough staff to open at weekends today he will say that , from april 2015 , the government will invest a further £ 100million into the fund			1
this will allow a second wave of pilot schemes			0
not all surgeries will open at weekends			2
instead , practices will band together and agree to take turns to open at weekends – seeing all patients from all their lists			2
a source said : ‘ we are not being prescriptive about this			0
we want to see practices joining together in hubs , to ensure all the patients on their lists have access to a @entity3 surgery at the weekend			2
‘ so it might not be your gp who is open , but there will be one down the road			0
’ however , when the pilots were launched last year , some doctors warned that the plan would be ‘ undeliverable ’			0
dr @entity150 , chairman of the @entity151 , said : ‘ it ’s not realistic to talk about gp services opening from 8 until 8 , seven days a week – that ’s the bottom line			0
’ later today @entity155 will publish the revised gp contract , which will include the return of a ‘ named gp ’			0
it means every person in the country will have a named family doctor who is responsible for their care outside hospital .			0
