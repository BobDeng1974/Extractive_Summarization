pianist @entity0 had severe labyrinthitis concert pianist @entity0 was recovering from a virus last @entity3 when she was overcome by a violent wave of dizziness and nausea			1
' i was watching a film at the cinema and suddenly the whole room was spinning around me , ' recalls @entity0 , 48 , a professor at the @entity11 , @entity12			1
' i felt like i was standing on a ship , swaying on the deck - and that i was about to be ill. it only lasted about three minutes but i rushed home in a taxi as my legs still felt like jelly and i could n't walk normally			2
i had no sense of balance			2
' when @entity0 reached her home in @entity12 ten minutes later , she lay down , but still felt as if the room was spinning			1
' it was like i was on the @entity25 and my bed was going up and down violently in a sea swell , ' she says			2
' i found it frightening			0
' the next day , she went to her gp , who diagnosed her with severe labyrinthitis			1
this is a common ear infection where the labyrinth , the innermost part of the ear , becomes inflamed or damaged , typically as a result of a viral infection such as cold or flu			1
the labyrinth not only contains the cochlea , which relays sound to the brain , but also the vestibular system , a complex set of fluid - filled channels that sends messages to the brain to help with balance			0
@entity50 is similar to vestibular neuritis , where an infection damages the vestibular nerve , causing faulty messages to be sent to the brain			1
indeed , doctors often treat labyrinthitis and vestibular neuritis as one condition , as the symptoms - and treatment - are largely the same ( the only difference is that labyrinthitis may also causes hearing loss )			1
the most common symptoms of both conditions are vertigo ( an intense spinning sensation ) , as well as nausea , vomiting and a feeling of unsteadiness , explains @entity73 , a consultant @entity74 surgeon at @entity76 , @entity77			1
the classic pattern is acute vertigo for a few days , which then settles , but a sense of unsteadiness and dizziness can persist for a few weeks , ' he says			1
' this happens because the brain is receiving faulty signals from the damaged labyrinth and / or vestibular nerve in one ear and becomes confused as it is out of sync with signals coming from the other ear			1
however , longer term , lying down may be the wrong thing to do treatment includes anti-sickness drugs such as prochlorperazine to reduce activity in the central nervous system or steroids to reduce inflammation			1
those affected are often told to lie down until the acute symptoms ease after a few days			0
however , longer term , lying down may be the wrong thing to do , experts say			1
' for both labyrinthitis and vestibular neuritis gps often prescribe rest and anti-travel sickness tablets , but while medication may help in the first day or two , when symptoms are more severe they will not help in the long term and may delay recovery , ' says @entity116 , professor emeritus of audio - vestibular medicine at the @entity118 , @entity12			1
' they stop the brain readjusting to the faulty signals the ear is sending			1
patients need to keep moving so that their brain starts to recalibrate and ignore the faulty signals - staying indoors and not moving is the worst thing they can do			1
' and although most cases of both conditions will resolve completely within three to eight weeks , about 10 per cent will have permanent damage to the labyrinth or vestibular nerve , and dizziness persists			2
these patients should be referred for specialist assessment , says professor @entity116			0
this may involve ' vestibular rehabilitation ' or physiotherapy , learning special exercises that compensate for the faulty signals coming from the balance sensors			0
these exercises typically include eye and head movements - such as teaching the patient to focus their eyes on a fixed object while moving their head			0
they may also watch videos of people walking down busy streets so their brain can start to ' relearn ' its balance in a safe , controlled environment			0
' physiotherapy is very effective and can be a great help , ' adds professor @entity116			0
however , patients who need it often do n't get this specialist treatment			2
patient stories on the labyrinthitis.org.uk website complain that @entity161 can seem reluctant to refer patients , with some waiting six months or more to see a specialist			0
the good news is that even if a patient has suffered severe dizziness for months they can benefit from specialist vestibular physiotherapy , says @entity169 , a physiotherapist in balance and dizziness at @entity172 , @entity173			1
' i recently treated a patient who has been effectively housebound for three years because his balance was so bad			0
he improved dramatically within three months			0
' unfortunately , if patients do n't get better within a few months they 're often told by @entity161 there 's nothing that can be done for them			0
vestibular rehabilitation is a very effective treatment , helpful in approximately 80 per cent of patients			2
' @entity0 finally saw a specialist vestibular physiotherapist once a week for a month @entity0 's @entity185 initially prescribed anti-nausea drugs and reassured her that the dizziness should clear up within weeks			1
' my first thought was how it was going to affect my work as i had a series of concerts booked for the following month , ' says @entity0 , a former winner of @entity194			1
' but i accepted my gp 's advice to rest and take a low dose of prochlorperazine			2
however , after two months her symptoms had n't improved and reluctantly she had to cancel three concerts last february			0
@entity201 life was also proving difficult			0
' i could n't shop or drive or use public transport as i still felt so dizzy , ' she says			0
' one day i tried to walk and i was clutching at the railings to keep upright - i must have looked like i was drunk			0
' i started to seriously worry about how this was going to affect my career			0
i could still play the piano - it seemed like when i was performing i just got a massive dose of concentration that seemed to override everything else			0
' but as soon as i stopped playing the dizziness would return			2
' by march , @entity0 had recovered enough to perform again , but still had to be driven to recitals			1
' i felt a general dizziness most of the time punctuated with more violent spinning vertigo attacks - it was so unpredictable it would n't have been safe to drive			2
' i was just existing - i could n't see the light at the end of the tunnel			0
i started to worry i may have something more seriously wrong , such as a brain tumour			2
' @entity0 went back to her gp in march			1
she was sent for an mri scan but the results were clear			0
other causes of dizziness include neurological conditions , stroke and multiple sclerosis , and it is important these are ruled out			2
by april , she was so desperate , @entity0 used her private medical insurance to see a vestibular medicine specialist at the @entity232 and @entity233			1
' one test involved trickling water into my right ear - it measures the difference in function between the two ears and from that my specialist was able to diagnose vestibular neuritis			2
' she explained the vestibular nerve was sending faulty signals and that my brain needed help to learn how to recalibrate and ignore these signals , ' says @entity0			1
she then saw a specialist vestibular physiotherapist once a week for a month			0
' she taught me exercises to practise twice a day , ' says @entity0			1
' these included standing on a huge pile of sofa cushions with my eyes shut and trying to balance			0
i also had to walk backwards and forwards , looking up and down and from right to left			0
' within a month my symptoms had improved by 50 per cent and i felt much more able to get on with normal life			0
it 's a huge relief			0
' @entity0 is now feeling fine and is able to work and drive again			1
' i want to let people know labyrinthitis and vestibular neuritis do n't always go away on their own - and there is specialist help available			2

concert pianist @entity0 , 48 , from @entity12 was overcome by dizziness
her gp diagnosed her with severe labyrinthitis , a common ear infection
treatment includes anti-sickness drugs or steroids
longer term , lying down may be the wrong thing to do
