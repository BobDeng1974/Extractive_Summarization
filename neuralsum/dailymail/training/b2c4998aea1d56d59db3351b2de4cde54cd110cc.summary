by @entity1 reporter published : 16:35 est , 23 july 2013 updated : 08:51 est , 24 july 2013 @entity2 has beaten its long - time rival @entity4 in one of the top viewer demographics for the first time in almost four years			1
the ratings grab by @entity2 comes months after the network 's morning show beat @entity11 for the first time in 16 years			2
though the battle between @entity13 and @entity11 has involved a well - documented round of musical chairs among the @entity11 , the evening news win marks a big win for @entity18			0
big win : @entity2 's @entity20 hosted by @entity18 beat the @entity4 counterpart in the ratings race twice last week reason to smile : @entity2 's morning program @entity13 had a major coup when they beat @entity11 in april 2012 for the first time in 16 years the journalist has anchored @entity2 's @entity20 since 2009 and the show 's ratings last week were just reported today			1
during the week of july 14 , @entity2 won the ratings race among viewers aged 25 to 54 years old on both monday and tuesday			1
@entity2 took 2.009 million viewers to @entity4 's 1.972 million on monday and continued their streak by pulling 1.891 million on tuesday as compared to @entity4 's 1.820 million that same evening			0
that said , @entity35 still ' won ' the 25 - 54 demographic , which is coveted among advertisers , on average for the week			1
deadline reports that this was the first time that @entity2 's evening news program beat its @entity4 counterpart in three years and 10 months			2
losing ground : @entity43 was brought on to the @entity11 after they lost to @entity13 for the first time in 16 years ( left ) , and @entity20 competes against @entity45 ' @entity35 ( right ) aside from being a point of pride for @entity18 , the boost in the networks ratings is a massive sales factor for @entity2 's advertising team			1
while this past week gave two tangible dates of record - breaking ratings , it has been a growing trend			2
@entity20 has cut the average gap that separated them from @entity4 by double digits for the past five weeks			0
that gap was cut by a whopping 40 per cent last week , @entity39 reports			0
one play that @entity2 is making in an effort to keep the rates up is to go heavy on their detailed coverage of the birth of the royal baby			0
both @entity4 and @entity2 have cut into their regularly scheduled programming throughout monday and tuesday , and they will air competing special programs on tuesday night .			0

@entity20 won the ratings fight over the coveted 25 - 54 year old demographic of viewers twice in one week
