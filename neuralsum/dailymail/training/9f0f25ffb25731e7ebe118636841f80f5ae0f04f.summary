by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 and @entity3 the @entity4 was yesterday accused of behaving like ‘ an unreliable boyfriend ’ for sending out mixed messages about when interest rates will rise			1
during a grilling by the @entity10 , @entity4 governor @entity8 was criticised for leaving homeowners ‘ not really knowing where they stand ’			1
although mr @entity8 predicted that interest rates – which have been held at a record low of 0.5 per cent since march 2009 – would rise soon , he would not give a firm answer as to when that might be			1
@entity4 governor @entity8 appeared to play down the prospect of an early interest rate rise @entity22 mp @entity21 told him : ‘ it strikes me the @entity4 is behaving a bit like an unreliable boyfriend – one day hot , one day cold			1
the people on the other side of the message are left not really knowing where they stand			0
’ it is now widely expected that interest rates will rise before the 2015 election and maybe even as early as the end of this year , which will have huge implications for millions of homeowners			2
and mr @entity8 raised concern about the 1.4million who have bought their first home since july 2007 , the last time interest rates were increased , and have never experienced a sudden rise in the monthly cost of their mortgage			1
mr @entity8 said : ‘ one danger is that , having lived through years of interest rates at rock - bottom levels , people assume they never go up			1
we have to dispel that			0
’ but the governor also took pains to stress that when interest rates do start rising , the process will be ‘ limited and gradual ’ – a phrase he used nine times during the two - hour hearing			2
economists predict the rate will be about 2.5 per cent by 2017			2
mps on the treasury select committee questioned whether mr @entity8 considered the impact of his comments on the money markets during the select committee hearing , mr @entity8 appeared to row back on a warning last week that rates could rise before the end of the year			1
he told @entity60 that low wage growth and spare capacity in the economy meant a rate rise this year was less likely			1
he struck a markedly different tone to his @entity75 speech last week , when he suggested the cost of borrowing would increase before the end of 2014 , adding : ' it could happen sooner than markets currently expect			1
' it was seen as a clear signal that homeowners had to brace themselves for a rate hike			2
but giving evidence to the treasury select committee today , mr @entity8 suggested the tentative economic recovery meant interest rates could remain at their historic low of 0.5 per cent for longer			1
the @entity4 base rate of interest has been at a record low of 0.5 per cent since 2009 he stressed that the decision to make the first increase in rates for five years would be based on the state of the economy			1
' the start of normalising of interest rates , the exact timing of that will be driven by the data , but the most important aspect of the guidance is that the increase in rates will be limited and gradual			0
' he warned that @entity109 would still be ' living in extraordinary times a few years down the road '			0
mr @entity8 was grilled by mps about whether his @entity75 speech was giving his personal view or the official line of the @entity4 's @entity116			1
he insisted that his comments were in line with @entity4 policy and wanted to shift market expectations about when a rate rise would come : ' really what we are trying to do is we would like to see the market adjust to the data			1
' last year the @entity4 said interest rates would not rise until the unemployment rate fell to 7 per cent , but when that target was met earlier than expected , it set broader criteria for a rise			1
mr @entity21 said : ' the purpose of guidance is to achieve clarity of expectations among households and consumers			0
' but mr @entity8 insisted the message from bank guidance had been ' very clearly received '			1
' as the economy progresses , the time to normalise interest rates is edging closer			2
but what is most relevant is those adjustments will be through a gradual process that is likely to be lower that historical averages			0
' ahead of the hearing , the @entity147 issued a call for interest rates to rise , possibly as early as this autumn			0
house prices in @entity152 rose by 18.7 per cent in the year to april , almost twice the national average of 9.9 per cent @entity147 chief economist @entity154 said : ' as the recovery takes hold it will soon be the time to start taking interest rates to a level where monetary policy can once again become an effective economic lever			0
' ideally this rise in interest rates will be achieved gradually , starting in the autumn of 2014 , with an aim of reaching a more normal level , perhaps 3 per cent , by autumn 2015			2
' mr @entity8 is expected to announce new rules later this week to further cut back on large and risky mortgage loans in a bid to head off the threat of a housing bubble			2
prices rose by 9.9 per cent in the year to april , surging by 18.7 per cent in @entity152			0
in 33 areas of @entity4 and @entity173 , property prices increased in value by more than annual local wages			2
first - time buyers have been hardest hit by the boom , with prices for them rising by more than 10 per cent in a year			0
people getting on to the first rung of the property ladder paid a record £ 199,000 in april , almost 10 times the average salary of people in their twenties			0
it is already getting harder for buyers to get a loan , with banks limiting mortgage approvals despite rising demand			0
the @entity4 reports that lenders forecast a ' lower appetite for risk ' over the next three months prices paid by first - time buyers are up 10.7 per cent year - on - year , but only 9.5 per cent for those already on the property ladder high street banks and lenders expect the number of new mortgage agreements to fall significantly from july to september			1
it follows changes to the @entity203 which forces lenders to more closely scrutinise borrowers ' income and outgoings to check if they can afford repayments if interest rates rise			0
in the past , people applying for a mortgage were asked for three months ’ pay slips and recent bank statements to show their major outgoings			0
but since april they have faced invasive questions about their finances and lifestyle , from their weekly food bill to the cost of their childcare arrangements and even how much they spend on gym membership			0
new rules limiting the amount that can be loaned in relation to incomes will also push down mortgage approval rates			0
@entity229 , a director of mortgage broker @entity230 , said : ' demand is still strong as buyers remain confident of their ability to get a mortgage and their perception that now is a good time to buy , with more stock coming onto the market			0

@entity4 governor appears to suggest rate rise is still months off
@entity75 speech expressed *surprise* markets did not expect 2014 rise
but today @entity8 insisted spare capacity in the economy is still a *problem*
