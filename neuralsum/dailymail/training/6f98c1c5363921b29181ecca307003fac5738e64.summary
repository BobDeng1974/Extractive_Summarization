two jet bracelets have been discovered in a @entity5 child 's coffin that has been prised open for the first time in 1,700 years			1
they are thought to have belonged to a young @entity5 girl who was buried in the small lead coffin , which was recently unearthed in a field in @entity12 when the archaeologists first opened the small lead coffin , they found a thick layer of clay , but have now uncovered bone fragments and the two bracelets , having ‘ fully excavated ’ the casket			1
project spokesman @entity34 said : ‘ it is reasonable to suppose [ the remains ] could be a female – such bracelets were normally worn by women			0
’ he also said the size of the bracelets suggests they were worn by the young girl			2

experts at @entity52 ( right ) are examining the 1700 - year - old @entity5 child 's coffin found in a field and hope to discover keepsakes inside experts believe the child buried in the coffin was a little girl , based on the discovery of the tiny bracelets ( one is pictured ) but they will also analyse the bone samples found to be certain the child is as yet unnamed , but archaeologists want to show their respect for her by giving her a roman name and have picked a number of options they want the public to vote for online			1
the names suggested are @entity74 , which means ' rise like the sun ' , @entity77 , which in @entity78 translates as ' i speak ' , @entity80 , meaning ' reveal ' , @entity81 , meaning ' inspire ' , @entity82 , which translates as ' illuminate ' and @entity83 , which means ' infant '			0
mr @entity34 said child burials from the time do not often survive in the ground and that the lead coffin preserved the remains , which is unusual			1
a 1,700 - year - old lead coffin , thought to contain the remains of a @entity5 child , has been found by a metal detecting club in a field in @entity12 the clay inside the coffin will be analysed by scientists : project spokesman @entity34 said because the material has been sealed inside a lead coffin , it can be compared to a time capsule the bracelets discovered in the coffin are extremely unusual and it is not known whether it was common for @entity5 girls to wear them , as so few burials of this kind have been found ‘ adding the jet bracelets makes it very unusual , ’ he said , explaining it is hard to know whether wealthy @entity5 children typically wore bracelets of this type , as so few burials have been found			1
speaking before the bracelets were discovered , mr @entity34 said the coffin can reveal so much about life at the times			2
' because of the sealed environment within the sealed lead coffin there is trapped evidence that would otherwise have been removed			1
it ’s like a time capsule , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity127 testing can tell us a lot			0
we may even be able to establish a cause of death if there is some chemical signature for it , ’ he added			0
the coffin was found by metal detecting enthusiast @entity44 in a field in @entity12 last month			1
the casket was discovered in a field in @entity140 , @entity12 , but its location was kept secret until the coffin was removed , as experts feared that grave robbers might steal or damage the find archaeologist @entity48 ( pictured ) removes the top layer of clay from inside the coffin			1
a collection of fragments unearthed from around the coffin , believed to be nails used in the outer wooden part of the coffin , are pictured right since then , it has been cleaned by experts from the @entity158 and the @entity159 , who will now take several months to analyse the contents			2
dating processes confirmed the child was buried up to 1,900 years ago , while the coffin ’s lead lining suggests she was born into a wealthy family mr @entity44 said he was stunned to stumble across the find			1
' my initial surprise was followed by shock and awe			0
it ’s different from the old coins we usually find			0
' archaeologists have no plans to return to the site where the coffin was found as they do not believe there are any other items of interest in the area			2
after the analysis is complete , the coffin is likely to be re-buried unless it is found to be historically significant			2
the coffin has been cleaned by experts from the @entity158 and the @entity159 , who will now take several months to analyse the contents ( pictured ) members of a metal detecting club stumbled across the coffin when they were searching a field in west @entity12 , about two miles away from where a @entity5 settlement and fort that is known to have existed			1
mr @entity44 , 30 , a surveyor , said : ' i can not describe how it feels to find something like this			0
you spend hours walking around fields , sometimes with little reward and then you find something this			0
' it is incredible , it makes all the hours worthwhile , it makes you feel so good			0
' we had been at it all day and then got a signal - it was quite deep so i " ummed and ahhed " about whether to just ignore it and move on , ' he said			0
but luckily mr @entity44 let curiosity get the better of him and began to dig. ' i was digging like mad when we began to see what it was - not in a way that might damage the item i must add - but just in an excited way , ' he said			0
' it would be great to have questions answered such as why a child should be given such a high status burial and why the burial took place there			0
' but perhaps these are questions that may never be answered			0
' the lead coffin is thought to hold the remains of the child of a very wealthy individual as it is estimated the casket would have cost the equivalent of about £ 200,000 in the third century ad @entity234 , 47 , founder of digging up the past metal detecting club said : ' it was about four feet underground on a field but the coffin was made of lead so we had no problem finding it			1
after digging down and discovering it was a coffin , they called the police and a vigil was set up at the site to protect it from grave robbers			2
mr @entity234 said : ' we assumed there were human remains in there so we contacted the police and they got in touch with the archaeologists from @entity254 , who also came out			0
' it seems to be third century @entity5 and because of the east - west alignment we think it was a @entity259 burial			2
the coffin is thought to hold the remains of the child of a very wealthy individual			1
' it ’s a lead coffin and we think it would have cost the equivalent of about £ 200,000 , so it was paid for by someone very wealthy , ' said mr @entity234			1
the coffin was found in a field in @entity12 and it could be the earliest example of a @entity259 burial in the county			1
