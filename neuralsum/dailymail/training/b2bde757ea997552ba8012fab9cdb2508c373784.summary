he is the only moors victim whose body has not been discovered the family of moors murders victim @entity1 have criticised police for not renewing the search for the body of the 12 - year - old whose mother died on saturday without fulfilling her dream of laying him to rest properly			1
they said they were fed up with ‘ pointless platitudes ’ , amid claims that it was only because of a forthcoming tv documentary that officers carried out high - profile raids to trace a letter in which killer @entity20 may have finally revealed the burial site			1
@entity1 ’s brother @entity23 spoke following the death of their mother , @entity20 , at 78			1
the mother , who was taunted until the very end by @entity30 , has asked that her grave have a plot left empty beside it for her murdered son 's burial , if he is ever found , the @entity27 reported			1
her family have vowed to continue her fight , after she spent her whole life trying to find @entity1 's remains , despite @entity30 refusing to tell her their location			1
meanwhile 74 - year - old @entity30 ’s health was reported to be fading amid claims that after 13 years on hunger strike , injuries he sustained after a seizure last month meant he is now too ill to be force - fed. mrs @entity47 died after a long battle with cancer without being informed of the possible existence of @entity30 ’s letter			1
last week @entity52 , head of @entity54 ’s cold case unit , said his officers would act on any credible new information about its whereabouts			2
however following mrs @entity47 ’s death , @entity23 , 56 , accused officers of not taking reports of the letter seriously until spurred on by media attention			2
he also claimed detectives – who have classified the search for his brother ’s body as dormant after repeated efforts came to nothing – had ignored leads from two ‘ credible ’ witnesses in recent months			2
' in an open letter he complained that ‘ all we receive is pointless platitudes and false statements that all new information will be treated seriously ’			2
@entity20 , pictured in 2010 , lost her battle with cancer on saturday without knowing where her son 's body is @entity20 , left , and @entity83 , right , who died in 2002 , have never revealed where @entity1 's body is and he warned : ‘ as far as i am concerned , until @entity1 is found then he is still in the possession of @entity30 and @entity83			1
‘ our fear as a family is that now my mother is no longer with us , this may be seen by the police and the media as some sort of closure to the case			2
this must not be allowed to happen both out of respect for @entity1 and my mother ’s memory and for those of us who loved them both			2
’ @entity1 ’s half - brother @entity107 , 46 , added yesterday : ‘ @entity54 only act when they ’re prompted			1
they ’ve not been very helpful for years			1
it does all come down to money – it was n’t high on their list of priorities			2
but it ’s what people want , they want to find him			2
’ it is claimed that after being force - fed for 13 years , @entity30 , who is in a high - security hospital , has been receiving only water since fracturing two vertebrae in a fall five weeks ago as he can no longer sit up to be given nourishment through tubes into his nose			1
@entity1 was on his way to visit his grandmother ’s house in @entity125 , @entity126 , when he was snatched by @entity30 and @entity83 on june 16 , 1964			1
until her health failed her , mrs @entity47 made frequent trips to @entity129 where @entity30 and @entity83 – who died in 2002 – buried four out of their five child victims			1
@entity54 declined to comment yesterday on criticism of their handling of the search for @entity1 ’s body or of their hunt for @entity30 ’s purported letter			1
officers called me scum @entity23 has cut a lonely figure during the 20 years he has dug in the peat on the bleak and windswept @entity129			1
his tireless search has so far been in vain			2
and like his mother @entity146 @entity47 before him , it is a quest he will pursue doggedly until his dying day			2
for @entity146 ’s death at the weekend does not bring her family ’s suffering to a close			2
@entity23 , 56 , is the forgotten victim of the @entity20			1
his elder brother @entity1 was snatched by @entity20 as he walked the short distance to their grandmother ’s home in 1964			1
the 12 - year - old ’s body has never been found			1
and the death of their mother has made @entity23 more determined to find where @entity30 concealed @entity1 ’s body			1
it is a search that has taken its toll on @entity23 ’s life in many ways : ‘ it ’s always on my mind – i ca n’t get rid of it , ’ he said			2
during his search , he even agreed to meet @entity83 in the hope that she might give him a clue			2
what drives him is more than brotherly love			0
he is also determined to ensure that @entity30 is not allowed the final insult of taking his secret to the grave			1
@entity23 , pictured right , with sergeant @entity180 during a search in 2001 for his brother 's body on @entity129 @entity23 was just eight when @entity1 went missing			1
on his website ( searchingforkeith.com ) he explains how they used to share a room in the end of terrace house in @entity189 , in the @entity125 area of @entity126			0
he recalls how they bent the street light which was positioned near their bedroom window so it almost came into their room			0
‘ we had the biggest bedside light in @entity125			0
the room was flooded with an orange glow every night , ’ he says			0
‘ @entity1 thought it was hilarious when we were told to be quiet and turn the light out			0
’ to this day , @entity23 treasures his brother ’s 1962 school report card which noted how @entity1 struggled with reading , despite his brother ’s attempts to help him			0
in return , @entity1 tried to teach @entity23 how to swim			0
@entity23 adds : ‘ @entity1 had little time for anything but laughter and nature			0
he was an ordinary , uncomplicated child			0
’ he recalls how @entity1 disappeared on june 16 , 1964 , four days after celebrating his birthday			0
‘ he just vanished from our lives			0
’ within days , the now well - known photo of his brother with a wide grin and @entity220 spectacles appeared on a ‘ missing ’ poster in shops , on billboards and in newspapers			1
suddenly , for @entity23 and his other five siblings , @entity1 ’s disappearance marked the end of the innocence of youth			0
‘ he was there one day and gone the next			0
i used to lie in bed at night talking to him , saying : “ where are you @entity1 ? ” at first we used to imagine he ’d been kidnapped , then gradually you realise he ’s not coming back alive			0
’ @entity23 was plagued by the ‘ what ifs ’ about that fateful day			0
even when @entity30 and @entity83 were convicted in 1966 for the murders of @entity239 , 12 , @entity240 , ten , and @entity20 , 17 , the pair refused to put the @entity1 family out of their misery by admitting they had murdered @entity1 , too			1
in 1985 , @entity30 finally confirmed that he had murdered @entity1 and @entity245 , 16			1
the confession , which came out of the blue , led @entity23 to begin digging on the moors			0
he says : ‘ it will never bring him back to life , but finding @entity1 and giving him a proper burial would be a way of bringing it to an end			1
‘ we went up every weekend and dug it until we hit rock			0
we went down until we could n’t go any further			0
’ he was often accompanied by well - wishers who had been moved by the family ’s plight			1
for their part , @entity54 called in archaeologists , anthropologists , geologists , geophysicists and geochemists – before giving up			0
@entity1 ’s body is the only one of the @entity30 ’s victims not to have been found			1
@entity23 ’s meeting with @entity83 came after he wrote to her and she invited him to meet her in prison			0
an aerial view of @entity129 where moors murderer @entity83 claims is the last resting of 12 - year - old @entity1 he was shocked when she grabbed his arms and sobbed as she repeatedly said sorry for her ruthless crimes			2
but although she did provide some maps before her death in 2002 , it was not enough to pinpoint @entity1 ’s body			0
@entity23 ’s decision to meet the @entity20 horrified his mother			1
@entity282 , the mother of @entity240 , also condemned him as a ‘ treacherous fool ’			0
but he felt justified because @entity83 was the only person likely to reveal where his brother was buried			0
later , his mother said she understood what he had done			0
the search , though , at what he calls ‘ that lonely place ’ , has had an adverse effect on his family life			0
‘ i regret the effect it had on my relationship with my son @entity294 , whom i hardly ever saw , ’ he says			2
last night , someone had placed flowers on the moors near to where @entity23 has spent years digging			1
an accompanying card reads : ‘ both together at last ’ – a reference to how @entity1 and his mother are reunited in heaven			0
it is a sentiment @entity23 can not share			0
‘ until @entity1 is found he is still in the possession of @entity30 and @entity83 , ’ he says			1
‘ our fear as a family is now my mother is no longer with us , this may be seen as closure			0
‘ this must not be allowed to happen out of respect for @entity1 and my mother ’s memory			0
he was a son , a brother , a friend and should have been a father and grandfather			2
he should have been whatever he wanted to be			0

@entity20 asks for a plot left to her grave be left empty for her murdered son 's burial
@entity30 , who has spent 13 years on hunger strike , may be too *unwell* to be force - fed
