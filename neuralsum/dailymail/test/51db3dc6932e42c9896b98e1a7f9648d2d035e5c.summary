a former @entity1 agent claims groping happens every day at security checkpoints across the @entity4 and staff routinely bend the rules to get their hands on passengers			1
@entity9 , who worked with the government agency for six years , added screeners will often pull attractive travellers aside so they can inappropriately touch them and will conduct bag checks on people they simply do not like			1
his comments follow revelations that two @entity1 workers were fired for manipulating body scanners in @entity20 as part of a scheme to pat men down before they boarded their flights			1
writing for @entity25 , he said the case was disturbing but admitted it came as no surprise to him			0
allegations : @entity9 , who worked with the @entity1 for six years , claims groping is a daily occurrence at security checkpoints across the country and said staff of ' bending the rules ' so they could inappropriately touch passengers ( file picture ) ' over the course of my six years with the @entity1 , the leveraging of rules and surveillance tools to abuse passengers was a daily checkpoint occurrence , ' he said			1
' and while it ’s easy to focus all the blame on the two unsavory screeners who are now no longer with the agency , perhaps the bigger issue here is a systemic one : there are far too many federal hands on people ’s private parts in airports			2
he added : ' perhaps the most disturbing part of the sexual assault of male passengers at @entity62 via full - body scanners is that the victims will likely never even know they were assaulted , since so many passengers have their private parts fondled when passing through the scanners , anyway			1
' it ’s difficult to tell where airport security ends and sexual assault begins these days			0
pat - downs of people ’s sensitive areas should be much rarer than they are at the airport			2
' mr @entity9 also alleged the body scanners , that are used by millions of @entity4 every year , are ' practically useless '			1
' the @entity1 , in its rush to replace the controversial “ nude ” radiation scanners that they phased out in 2013 , swapped out one poorly functioning line of machines for another			2
' the current millimeter wave scanners , with their outrageous false - positive rates , regularly cause unnecessary pat - downs : the agent running his or her hands over you after you pass through the scanner is almost never doing it for a good reason			2
' the sackings follow a number of controversies over the screening of passengers at @entity4 airports since 2010 , when the agency adopted heightened security measures including full body imaging and pat downs			1
in november , a @entity1 employee tipped off the agency that a male screener at the airport told her he groped male passengers he found attractive , according to a @entity20 police report			1
in response , an investigator went to the airport in february and saw the screener signal to a female colleague when a certain male passenger entered the screening area , the police report said			0
scandal : his comments follow revelations that two @entity1 workers were fired for manipulating body scanners in @entity20 ( security pictured ) as part of a scheme to pat men down as they passed through security checks the woman colleague used a touchscreen system to categorize the passenger falsely as a female , which caused a scanning machine erroneously to detect an anomaly and trigger a pat - down of the passenger , the police report said			1
the investigator watched as the male screener then used that opportunity to pat down the passenger 's groin and buttocks , according to the police report			0
the woman screener was later interviewed by the investigator and told him she had participated in the pat - down scheme at least 10 other times			0
" these alleged acts are egregious and intolerable			0
@entity1 has removed the two officers from the agency , " the @entity1 said in a statement			0
the names of the two fired @entity1 screeners were withheld from the @entity20 police report released to the media			1
the @entity1 submitted its findings to @entity20 police , who turned the case over to the district attorney 's office for a possible charge of unlawful sexual contact			2
none of the passengers believed to have been touched by the screener could be identified , so prosecutors declined to file that charge , said office spokeswoman @entity171			0
potential victims have already began contacting the @entity1 and , as the investigation continues , criminal charges could come in the future			0
earlier this month it was also revealed the @entity1 would ' enhance ' pat - down training following complaints from @entity179 - @entity4 women that they were being racially targeted for unnecessary screenings .			0
