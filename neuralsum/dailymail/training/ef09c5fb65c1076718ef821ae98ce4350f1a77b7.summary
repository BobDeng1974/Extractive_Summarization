@entity0 is convinced his rookie @entity3 wing , @entity4 , can scorch into @entity6 ’s @entity5 plans after his hat - trick against @entity8 last week			1
the 23 - year - old showcased blistering pace and finishing class with his brilliant @entity13 treble at the @entity14 , despite the best efforts of the visitors ’ fabled ‘ wolf pack ’ defence to stop him			2
although the @entity19 suffered an agonising 36 - 32 loss on saturday , @entity4 made a strong impression at a time when @entity6 are on the hunt for prolific wide - men			1
now , as he prepares for a return to @entity26 , where he came through the ranks , @entity4 has been identified by his director of rugby as a potential test candidate , with @entity32 announcing his autumn squad on october 22			1
@entity4 ( r ) scores a hat - trick against for @entity3 in their 36 - 32 defeat by @entity8 @entity3 coach @entity0 insists that @entity4 can make the step up for @entity6 @entity0 said : ‘ there are a number of young fliers , like @entity48			1
last year it was @entity49 ( @entity50 )			0
right now people are going “ who ’s hot ? ” if you ’re a back three player your currency is speed and try - scoring			0
it ’s early doors , but players like @entity4 will emerge and put pressure on			2
’ asked if a late run into contention for next year ’s @entity5 was still feasible , the former @entity6 attack coach added : ‘ yeah , definitely			1
if someone scores a dozen tries in the league , they ’re going to be asking questions			0
@entity3 players look dejected after losing such a close contest at the @entity14 ‘ i ’d say @entity6 are trying to work out what they want to do on the wing			1
go back a year or two and they were playing an extra full - back , now i think they ’re looking at out - and - out scorers			0
’ @entity4 believes it is ‘ too soon ’ for any realistic hope of a call - up but he represented his country in the same @entity71 16 , 18 and 19 teams as @entity73 and @entity74			2
@entity77 certainly has several wing options to consider			0
in addition to @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 , he will be keen to assess @entity83 at @entity84 , if the turbo - charged @entity85 can stay fit , while @entity87 was on the scoresheet for @entity89 last weekend			0
another prime contender is @entity91 of @entity92 , but he is currently recovering from a foot injury .			0
