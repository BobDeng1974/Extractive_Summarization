a @entity0 minister has ordered @entity2 lawyers to oppose the right of @entity5 workers to wear a cross			1
on the instructions of equalities minister @entity8 , they will call on @entity10 human rights judges to dismiss the claims of @entity5 workers who have been banned from displaying the symbol of their faith at work			1
the move means that @entity17 ’s @entity16 is now lined up against the @entity5 churches on a second battleground – the prime minister is already at loggerheads with both @entity23 and @entity24 churches over same - sex marriage			1
@entity8 : opposes right of @entity5 workers to wear a cross it also puts the government at odds with its own equality quango			1
the @entity32 is to argue in the same @entity34 test case that workers should have legal protection if they wish to display a token of their religious faith at work			1
the @entity41 court is poised this spring to begin consideration of the cases of @entity44 and @entity45			1
mrs @entity46 , a @entity47 check - in clerk , was suspended from work in 2006 after refusing instructions to take off the cross she wore while at work			1
controversy : the @entity41 court will hear the case of two @entity5 workers this spring @entity54 , above , has made an impassioned defence of @entity5 against attacks from ‘ militant neo-atheists ’			1
the tv cook voiced concerns about the threat to believers from ‘ devout secularists ’ in her @entity63 on her website			1
she wrote : ‘ i am , as you may or may not know , a passionate believer but of late , we are somewhat under the cosh			1
‘ there is a running battle going on in the @entity71 , and militant neo-atheists and devout secularists are busting a gut to drive us off the radar and try to convince us that we hardly exist			1
’ on www.deliaonline.com , which has two million regular users , she urged people to support the aid charity @entity79 , the @entity79			2
she added : ‘ while the belief battle grabs the headlines , one thing we all stand united on is hopefully our common belief in human life and human flourishing			2
’ miss @entity54 , 70 , later said she was responding to atheist scientist @entity87 , who said recently that religion was increasingly irrelevant in @entity89			2
she said : ‘ atheists have been saying that @entity5 is dying			2
he [ @entity87 ] did a survey which said we were not a @entity5 country , which was cheeky – and not true			2
@entity96 are alive and kicking			2
’ mr @entity87 had backed up his claim by saying that the proportion of people identifying themselves as @entity96 had fallen from 72 per cent to 54 per cent during the past decade			0
miss @entity54 , who was baptised in the @entity23 and attended a @entity100 before converting to @entity101 at 22 , has written books on religion			0
@entity47 backed down after her case provoked condemnation , but mrs @entity46 , 58 , has been campaigning to cement the rights of @entity96 to wear religious symbols , a right she says is routinely accorded to followers of other faiths			0
mrs @entity45 , 56 , a nurse , was barred from working on the wards of her hospital in @entity113 after she refused to remove or hide the cross she wore on her necklace chain			0
the claims of both women that they have a right to wear a cross – under @entity10 human rights rules which guarantee the right to manifest belief – have been rejected by @entity89 courts			0
both women have won backing from the @entity124 , headed by former @entity126 politician @entity125 , which is to tell the @entity41 judges that believers have the right to display their faith even if it is not a strict requirement of their religion that they do so			0
but @entity2 lawyers will follow the line set down by @entity135 and argue that ‘ in neither case is there any suggestion that the wearing of a visible cross or crucifix was a generally recognised form of practising the @entity5 faith , still less one that is regarded as a requirement of the faith ’			0
the @entity146 and @entity45 cases are among four test claims regarded by @entity96 as being at the centre of their efforts to ensure their faith is not marginalised by the @entity151 or pushed out of public life			0
two other cases involve a registrar sacked by her council for declining to conduct civil partnership ceremonies , and a @entity158 counsellor sacked after he said he would not give sex advice to gay couples			0
a spokesman for the @entity162 , which supervises miss @entity8 ’s @entity163 , said : ‘ the @entity164 makes very clear that people have the right to express their views in a legitimate way , as long as they do not discriminate against a particular group or individual			1
‘ therefore the @entity89 is not in breach of its obligations under the @entity174 , as alleged by the applicants			0
it would be inappropriate to comment further on the details of these cases at this stage			0
’ but former archbishop of canterbury @entity180 said : ‘ the irony is that when governments and courts dictate to @entity96 that the cross is a matter of insignificance , it becomes an even more important symbol and expression of our faith			0

move is from equalities minister @entity8
it puts the government at odds with its own equality quango
