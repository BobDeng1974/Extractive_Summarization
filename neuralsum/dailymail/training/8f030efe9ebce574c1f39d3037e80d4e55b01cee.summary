looking shyly into the camera , nothing in @entity3 ’s high school volleyball team photograph suggests that she was destined for bigger things			1
in this exclusive photograph from 1980 , she was certainly taller than many of her classmates at 5ft 11 inches , but both her name – @entity10 for ‘ @entity11 ’ – and her conservative hairstyle fitted right in with her @entity14 peers in the factory city of @entity16			1
few among her wealthy , well - connected society friends in the @entity18 would recognize the teenage athlete , as @entity20 , who until last summer was the wife of @entity21 , the world ’s most powerful and controversial media mogul			1
@entity24 dreams : @entity20 , then known as @entity3 , in her high school volleyball team in 1980 work : ms @entity20 was said to have had ' some cosmetic surgery work ' when she moved to @entity18 with the main ambition of becoming ' rich and famous ' through sheer force of will and the patronage of certain well - placed friends , @entity32 , the name she adopted in her teens , went from the poor daughter of a $ 50 - a - month factory manager living in a town where the lights went out every night at 7pm to a multi-millionaire divorcee in a $ 60million triplex on @entity41 in the city that never sleeps			1
the first step in her remarkable journey began with her arrival in @entity47 in february 1988 after meeting a 50 - year - old @entity18 engineer working on a project in @entity16 , who agreed to help improve her @entity51			2
with the enthusiastic co-operation of his wife , @entity52 sponsored @entity32 ’s student visa and put her up at their @entity56 , @entity47 , home sharing a bedroom with their five - year - old daughter			2
suddenly , from sharing clothes with friends in @entity16 and donning her lookalike high school volleyball team uniform , @entity32 was wearing pairs of $ 200 jeans , her @entity68 , @entity69 , economics professor @entity62 told @entity70			1
in a 2007 interview by writer @entity72 for @entity75 ’s ‘ @entity74 ’ magazine , @entity62 also described @entity32 as ' a trendy dresser , a modern girl '			0
now : ms @entity20 attended the @entity78 by @entity80 reception at the @entity81 on february 11			2
it was the first time she was seen in public since a revealing @entity70 profile according to another of her professors , @entity87 , @entity88 , one of his brightest students , had ‘ some kind of cosmetic surgery ’ and turned up wearing dark glasses at around that time when she was living in @entity94 in the mid- 1990s			1
‘ i do n’t remember a whole lot , ’ @entity87 said this week			2
‘ we are going back to the 1990s			0
‘ when she graduated there was a picture of her taken when she had a lunch with a couple of friends			2
’ ‘ can you imagine what it would 've been like , how she got there with no knowledge of the culture ? ’ a @entity81 friend of @entity32 ’s told @entity72			0
‘ it was almost inevitable that she was going to make some mistakes			0
i do n't think she has an evil personality ; she just has this incredible ambition coupled with this lack of self - consciousness			2
she got to @entity47 and she wanted to social - climb , to get out of the situation that got her there			0
’ by this time , the @entity52 ’s marriage had become a casualty of @entity32 ’s move to the @entity123			0
according to a numerous reports , @entity52 - who is now 76 - was kicked out of the family home by his wife , @entity127 , after she discovered he was having an affair with his young protégé			0
power : ms @entity20 enjoyed a rapid rise from the daughter of a factory worker in @entity10 to the wife of @entity21 , enjoying a life of luxury in a $ 60million triplex on @entity41 , @entity81 @entity32 and @entity52 wed in february 1990 , but the marriage lasted just four months before she met a revelations : the @entity70 piece stoked up rumors that she had a crush on former @entity144 prime minister @entity143 and liked his ' good body ' younger man , @entity146 , who was closer to her own age			1
the @entity148 later reported the divorce became official after two years and seven months in 1992 , which is seven months longer than what was required for @entity151 to obtain a ' green card '			0
from there , @entity151 ’s social ascent became all the more rapid			0
she enrolled in an mba course at the prestigious @entity157 in 1995 and as part of her internship requirement she won a temporary job at @entity161 , a satellite television station in @entity162 that was owned by @entity21 ’s @entity163			2
the internship may have taken her back to @entity10 , but it was also the direct route to the heart of one of the titans of capitalism			0
simply put , according to her old @entity161 colleagues , @entity151 ’s ‘ ambition was to be rich and famous			1
’ it was n’t long before an opportunity came her way to meet @entity21 when she was reportedly asked to accompany him as an interpreter and guide on a trip to @entity181			2
the may - december working relationship developed into a romance , rocking the @entity21 family			2
@entity21 and @entity32 were married in 1999 , just 17 days after his divorce from ex-wife @entity186			1
the union would bring the couple two children and all the fame @entity32 could have ever dreamed of			0
she met the @entity191 and hobnobbed with tycoons and movie stars			0
her photograph was a staple of the society columns and , if a recent @entity70 article is to believed , she was impressed by other powerful men like @entity200 chairman @entity199			1
according to a note to herself written by @entity32 that was published in @entity70 , she was more than happy with the way her transformation from @entity10 factory town girl to @entity207 society maven has worked out			0
break up : ms @entity20 divorced mr @entity21 last year after having two of his children			1
her notes that were revealed in @entity70 revealed that she thought she had ' style , grace ' that she ' looked gorgeous and so young , so cool ' ‘ @entity213 [ girlfriend of @entity199 , left ] will never have my style , grace , ’ she wrote			1
‘ i achieved my purpose of @entity72 saw me looking so gorgeous and so fantastic and so young , so cool , so chic , so stylish , so funny and he can not have me			0
’ the article also revealed details of a lovestruck note from ms @entity20 , in which she praised former @entity144 prime minister @entity143 ’s ‘ good body ’ , his ‘ really , really good legs ’ and even his ‘ butt ’			1
it said staff at mr @entity21 ’s home in @entity228 , @entity47 , were uneasy when mr @entity143 arrived and tried to find her			1
the magazine claimed they told him ms @entity20 had gone to the master bedroom , but ‘ by the time they could tell her , mr @entity143 was looking for her , they found mr @entity143 walking into the master bedroom and closing the door behind him ’			1
on another occasion ‘ they were feeding each other during dinner , which made the staff uncomfortable ’ , the magazine claimed			0
mr @entity143 ’s friends deny he had an affair , they were feeding each other and that he was ever alone with ms @entity20			1
@entity70 says mr @entity143 had ' rolled his eyes ' and looked ' panicked ' when he was told mr @entity21 would not be joining them until the following night			1
just a week after the @entity70 story broke , @entity32 , now 45 , was back in the limelight hosting a diamond promotional night in @entity81			0
wearing a glamorous lace black and cerise gown she could afford to smile for the camera			0
she ’d come a very long way from that posed team photo with her high school sports team .			0
