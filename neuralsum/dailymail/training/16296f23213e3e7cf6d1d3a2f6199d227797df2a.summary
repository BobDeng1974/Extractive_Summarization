@entity0 started off their @entity2 campaign with a disappointing 1 - 1 draw at home to @entity6 outfit @entity5			1
@entity7 scored his first goal for the club to give them a first - half lead but as well as @entity12 was guilty of missing a gilt edged chance to increase the lead , with the hosts made to pay for their missed chances , as @entity19 's second half goal secured a draw for the visitors			1
here , @entity23 's @entity22 gives his verdict on the performance of both sets of players			0
@entity7 coolly slots the ball home past @entity30 to give @entity0 the lead against @entity5 @entity0 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) @entity32 - when called upon was excellent , notably with his save from @entity34 's strike on 39 miutes			1
@entity37 - possibly @entity0 's best player other than @entity38 this season and good again on tuesday night			1
experienced @entity0 duo @entity39 and @entity37 in action during the first half against @entity5 @entity39 - not the steady performance expected			1
struggled against a good attack			0
@entity45 - @entity44 , unassured			0
let @entity46 run through the middle of him and @entity39 in the first half			0
@entity49 - no more than steady			0
likely to be replaced by @entity50 on sunday			0
@entity51 - provides the core of this @entity0 side , an increasingly influential figure at the base of midfield			1
@entity57 - workmanlike rather than inspired			0
did his job for 40 minutes , but then game began to run away from @entity0 's midfield			2
the energetic @entity57 looks to get @entity0 going in midfield during the first half against @entity5 @entity63 - good in all fits and starts , with bright runs every now and then but never enough to be decisive			1
@entity63 goes in for a challenge with @entity5 left - back @entity68 during the first half @entity71 to score as he fouled @entity72 in the build up ; missed a great chance to make it 2 - 0 ; lost possession for @entity5 's equaliser			1
the @entity77 celebrates putting @entity0 ahead inside 11 minutes against @entity5 at @entity78 @entity5 early on			1
@entity0 's most inventive player			2
but missed late volleyed chance and denied by @entity30 on 85 minutes			0
7.5 @entity81 looks to get on the attack during the first half of @entity0 's clash with @entity5 @entity12 - not the @entity12 of old			1
a yard slower , a degree less frightening			0
it 's not the same			0
@entity91 , making his first start of the season for @entity0 , looks on during the first half against @entity5 @entity93 : oscar - brought on to add more flair and helped lift @entity0			1
@entity96 strike on 78 minutes that was headed off line by @entity98			0
@entity99 - not enough time to make his customary impact			2
manager : @entity102 - tried to lift his team with substitutions but it was a flat night for @entity0			2
@entity102 looks on during the first half of @entity0 's @entity2 clash with @entity5 @entity107 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) @entity108 save from @entity81 at the end to earn his side a point			1
7.5 @entity5 keeper @entity30 celebrates with defender @entity112 after the 1 - 1 draw with @entity0 @entity114 - had the misfortune to be up against @entity81			1
@entity116 - for one so young , acquitted himself well			0
@entity5 had three centre halves out injured			0
@entity119 header off the line to stop @entity122 's shot and dealt well with @entity12			0
@entity68 - grew into the game and contributed to manfully to @entity5 's back line			2
@entity63 goes in for a challenge with @entity5 left - back @entity68 during the first half @entity128 - did n't stop running and caused @entity0 occasional shaky moments			1
@entity34 - his aggression threatens to get the better of him - but he is a vital cog in this @entity5 side			2
@entity34 put in another typically boisterous performance at @entity78 on tuesday night @entity134 - at times over-run but kept his head and helped @entity5 back into the game			2
@entity138 constant thorn in @entity0 's side , strolling through the wide spaces in midfield to set up equaliser			0
@entity143 - unlucky to concede possession for @entity0 's goal when he was fouled by @entity7			1
@entity19 - a captain 's performance			2
held the line wonderfully and took his goal brilliantly			0
@entity19 finishes superbly from close range after excellent build - up play from @entity5 @entity5 players celebrates @entity19 's equaliser during the second half at @entity78 @entity93 : @entity155 - helped @entity5 see out the game and get their point			1
@entity158 - ( 86 mins - no mark ) manager : @entity162 - under pressure , this was a huge performance from his team			0
referee : @entity166 ( @entity167 ) - missed the foul in the build up to @entity0 's goal ; otherwise passable			1
video our plans worked perfectly - @entity173			0

@entity7 first goal for @entity0 gave them a first - half lead
however the @entity77 missed a golden opportunity to make it 2 - 0
and the @entity180 were made to pay as @entity19 equalised for @entity5 with his 10th @entity2 goal
