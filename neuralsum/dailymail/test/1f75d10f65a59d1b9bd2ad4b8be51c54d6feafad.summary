this represented a serious breach of trust			2

a jury at @entity18 , @entity19 , found him guilty of rape and four other sex abuse charges ' the panel takes the view that this case is serious , it does indeed involve abuse of trust , sexual abuse of a serious nature and , furthermore , there is no evidence of insight on the part of the registrant			1
' the @entity11 panel chairman @entity124 added : ' the registrant entered a plea of not guilty to each of the charges and was found guilty following a 13 day trial			1
