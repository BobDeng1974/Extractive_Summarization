would - be jihadi fighters are booking tickets on cruise ships to join extremists in battle zones in @entity5 and @entity6			1
the new tactic has been deployed by jihadists hoping to bypass the stepped - up efforts to thwart them in neighbouring @entity10			1
according to @entity13 officials , the phenomenon is relatively new and has been used by would - be fighters in the last three months			1
would - be jihadi fighters are travelling on cruise ships to try and join extremist groups in @entity5 and @entity6 @entity10 , with its long and often porous border with @entity5 , has been a major thoroughfare for many of the thousands of foreign fighters seeking to join extremists like @entity24 , which has captured territory across @entity6 and @entity5			1
@entity10 authorities say they have set up teams to capture suspected foreign fighters in airports and bus stations , and have deported hundreds in recent months			1
as such , would - be jihadists have made alternative travel arrangements to reach battle zones			2
@entity34 , director of counterterrorism at @entity13 , said : ' because they know the airports are monitored more closely now , there 's a use of cruise ships to travel to those areas			2
' there is evidence that the individuals , especially in @entity43 , are traveling mostly to @entity44 and other places to engage in this type of activity , ' he said , referring to a @entity10 coastal town			2
' originally , our concern about people on cruise ships - dangerous people on cruise ships - really focused on the classic sort of rapist , burglar , or violent criminal			2
' but as we 've gathered data , we 've realised that there are more and more reports that people are using cruise ships in order to get to launch pads , if you will - sort of closer to the conflict zones - of @entity5 and @entity6			0
' the outgoing @entity13 chief called on countries to step up screening at all transportation hubs to halt the advance of extreme groups such as @entity24 cruise ships , which often make repeated stops , offer an added benefit by allowing would - be jihadis to hop off undetected at any number of ports - making efforts to track them more difficult			1
mr @entity79 said it was n't exactly clear yet how many would - be foreign fighters were travelling by cruise ship to reach @entity5			0
he added that some people have driven all the way from their homes in @entity43 to the @entity5 border to avoid passing through airports			0
he was quick to caution that @entity43 is by no means the only or even the main source of foreign fighters for @entity5			0
' it 's a global threat - 15,000 fighters or more from 81 countries traveling to one specific conflict zone , ' he said , noting that that there are some 300 from @entity96 alone			0
' in order to prevent their travel and identify them , there needs to be greater information - sharing among the region , among national security agencies			0
' speaking in @entity105 , where @entity13 is holding its general assembly this week , outgoing chief @entity107 confirmed that @entity10 was a destination , but declined to identify any others			1
he also refused to indicate how many people might be involved , but called on countries to step up screening at all transportation hubs - ' airports and , more and more , cruise lines			0
' this is one of the reasons why the international police body is preparing to expand a pilot programme known as i - @entity122 , where airlines share passenger information off @entity13 's databases - in the hope that one day the system could expand to include cruise operators , banks , hotels and other private - sector partners			1
many @entity43 governments have expressed concern that home - grown jihadis who self - radicalise online and then travel to @entity5 will return home with skills to carry out terror attacks			0
@entity141 @entity140 , who allegedly spent a year in @entity5 and fought with @entity142 , is the chief suspect in a may attack on the @entity144 of @entity145 that killed four people .			0
