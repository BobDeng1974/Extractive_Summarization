this felt a heavy blow for @entity2			1
looking on course for a first victory in seven championship games against the 10 men of @entity8 , they conceded an equaliser to @entity10 that further undermines their promotion ambitions			1
@entity13 seized on hesitant defending by @entity14 with 15 minutes to go to slip a weighted pass to his @entity8 team - mate , who poked the ball past @entity19 to snatch an unlikely point			1
there was a seismic rally from the hosts , who ended the game camped in @entity8 ’s box , never mind half			1
the final act was @entity29 producing a fingertip save from @entity32 ’s header			0

there was a goalline clearance			0
@entity52 arrived for his first minutes in nearly two months			0
but it is only a point for @entity62 ’s side			0
enough to lift them back into the play - off places having fallen out earlier on @entity93 following positive results for those around them			0
only on goal difference however			0
having played a man up for the entire second half , this was a big opportunity missed			0
it had seemed @entity53 , fresh from pulling out of @entity103 ’s under - 21 side to concentrate on reigniting his stuttering career , had produced a goal of splendour that would do much the same for @entity2 ’s season			1
@entity53 picked up the ball in the 57th minute , danced round two @entity8 defenders and bent a finish into the far corner			1
at that stage @entity2 were set for a first victory since february 24			2
but @entity80 adjusted his team cleverly and @entity8 found a way through			2
@entity2 had begun the match as if the international break had been spent on a leash now removed			2
a fortnight to stew on poor form and a loosening grip on promotion ambition , here was an chance to illustrate there is life in the old dog yet			0
@entity53 watches on as his strike flies into the bottom corner to put @entity2 2 - 1 up against @entity8 @entity53 ( left ) , alongside team - mate @entity39 , celebrates putting @entity2 in the lead against their promotion rivals @entity62 screams from the touchline as his @entity2 side look to strengthen their promotion charge just two points collected in six games and the for those around them earlier in the day meant @entity2 entered the contest outside the top six for the first time since september 27			1
@entity8 came into this game with a defeat ringing in their ears too , a 1 - 0 home reverse to @entity145 , but in pretty decent nick in general : five wins from the six before that			2
the atmosphere carried the appropriate edge for a match of this magnitude , both sets of fans vocal			0
it was the hosts who started with greater energy			0
@entity8 's @entity63 saw red just before half - time when he brought down @entity54 in the area @entity39 slotted the penalty past @entity29 in the @entity8 goal to level the scores at 1 - 1 the former @entity103 striker 's penalty levelled the score at 1 - 1 just before the half - time break in the 15th minute @entity39 had a close - range shot deflected wide and from the resulting corner a smart routine , involving @entity51 and @entity48 , saw @entity53 released to the byline			1
his cutback found @entity39 but the striker ’s former @entity173 colleague @entity29 saved the finish superbly			2
@entity8 , starting with three forwards in @entity36 , @entity71 and @entity10 who have 48 championship goals between them this season , carried a sizeable offensive threat			1
in the 23rd minute they went ahead			0
it was more sloppy defending from @entity2 , who have suffered from slackness at the back during their downturn			0
@entity185 was twice at fault , first losing possession to @entity71 when trying to dribble clear then driving his attempted clearance in the box straight into @entity190			2
the ball popped to @entity71 who lashed home a first - time finish for his fifth goal in seven games			1
@entity71 celebrates his goal - the first of the match - to put @entity8 in the lead away from home @entity71 ( left ) smiles to the crowd after putting @entity8 1 - 0 up with his fifth goal in seven matches late in the game , there was a brutal clash of heads between @entity13 ( left ) and @entity46 both players were sent flying and needed extensive treatment from their respective physios @entity13 was impressive for @entity8 , and was named man of the match by @entity213 shortly after his injury @entity62 came down from his position in the stands unusually early to bark instructions and rearrange his side with @entity48 needing to come off injured on his return from a spell out			1
@entity221 was sent on and contributed to the equaliser , delivering a smart backheel that gave @entity53 space to thread a pass to @entity54 in the area			2
he took a touch and was brought down by @entity63			0
referee @entity82 pointed to the spot and , after consideration , produced the red card for denial of a goalscoring opportunity			1
this was welcome change for @entity2 fans who had seen their side suffer defeat @entity238 last time out after a horrible officiating error			0
@entity39 stepped up and dispatched the penalty with clinical power , his eighth goal since arriving on loan from @entity246			1
@entity62 replaced @entity247 with @entity45 in a bold attacking move at the interval , in search of a crucial victory			0
but it was not to be			0
@entity39 swivels to shoot at @entity29 in the @entity8 goal , but he puts it wide and misses the chance to score @entity39 reacts to his missed chance , while @entity8 's @entity69 ( right ) watches on with relief @entity8 are still in the hunt for a promotion spot after they hung on for a 2 - 2 draw despite losing a man			1

@entity71 opened the scoring with his fifth goal in seven matches
@entity8 could not hold on after @entity63 gave away a penalty
he was shown a straight red card and @entity39 scored the spot kick
in the second half , @entity53 scored to complete @entity2 's comeback
@entity8 were *n't* finished though , and @entity10 levelled at 2 - 2
