one of @entity1 ’s rising stars was last night accused of thwarting a mission to save the @entity4 doctor who died in a @entity6 jail			1
the grieving family of dr @entity8 , 31 , claimed that @entity9 – dr @entity8 ’s mp – told a delegation not to travel to @entity13 to lobby for his release			1
last night @entity15 mp @entity9 released a statement in which he insisted that he had done everything in his power to help dr @entity8			1
the family of dr @entity8 , including mother @entity20 and brother @entity21 , has said @entity1 mp @entity9 stopped a delegation travelling to @entity6 to lobby for their son 's release @entity6 officials , who have been accused of torturing the doctor , claimed that he ‘ committed suicide ’ by hanging himself with his pyjamas in the state interrogation centre in @entity13 last week			1
the @entity6 regime handed the body to the @entity33 yesterday , who took it by road to @entity36 , from where it will be flown back to the @entity4			2
mr @entity9 , who is shadow business secretary , has said he did everything in his power to help @entity8 the surgeon , who was a specialist registrar at the @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity43 , went to the @entity45 - @entity6 border in october 2012 to treat wounded refugees			1
he then crossed the border into @entity6 and began working in a field hospital in the war - ravaged city of @entity50 treating civilians			2
he was arrested within 48 hours by government forces as he did not have a valid visa			2
his arrest came at a time when hundreds of @entity4 were suspected of entering @entity6 to join @entity56			2
no evidence has emerged that dr @entity8 had any involvement with militants			1
dr @entity8 ’s sister @entity61 , 24 , said that her family had expected mr @entity9 to discuss dr @entity8 ’s case with @entity64			1
‘ he could have got my brother released much earlier as he could have pressed the @entity66 to help , ’ she said			2
another member of the @entity8 family described mr @entity9 as a ‘ chicken mp ’			1
dr @entity8 died just days before a delegation of @entity4 parliamentarians were due to visit @entity13 to secure his release			1
the family say the group was initially due to fly out last month , but accused mr @entity9 of ‘ sabotaging ’ the plan by warning mps about the safety risks			1
@entity1 mp @entity77 , who was going to lead the delegation , confirmed that he was advised by mr @entity79 not to travel			1
mr @entity77 said : ‘ i then took further advice from a number of people , friends of mine who have got interests out there , and they said i would be ok			2
’ outspoken mp @entity87 , who was involved in negotiating for the release of dr @entity8 , said of mr @entity9 : ‘ he was the dog which did n’t bark			1
dr @entity8 was imprisoned in @entity6 after going to treat wounded civilians and was due to be released before the @entity6 government claimed he hung himself ' i do n’t know why he was reluctant to get involved ... was it because of the false tittle - tattle around @entity95 that @entity8 was a @entity96 ? i hope not			1
’ mr @entity9 said in a statement : ‘ for over 12 months now i have been in contact with members of his family and the @entity66 , doing what i can to assist the family as they have tried to secure his release			1
’ the @entity66 said : ‘ we consistently sought consular access to dr @entity8 and information on his detention			1
these requests were consistently ignored			2
’ last night dr @entity8 ’s mother , @entity20 , 57 , was seen leaving the morgue in @entity36 where her son ’s body was being kept			1
clearly distressed , she said : ‘ they ’ve killed my baby			0
’ the body was later transferred to the @entity117 in @entity36 and was due to be flown to the @entity4 today			0
as dr @entity8 ’s body was driven out of @entity6 yesterday a @entity4 medical convoy of 50 ambulances were heading into the country from @entity45			1
dr @entity8 , the @entity4 @entity122 surgeon who risked his life to save women and children in the @entity6 inferno , is far more than an isolated hero or martyr			1
he is a rallying figure – a symbol of all that is decent and humane in the vast majority of the @entity122 population throughout the world			0
hence his martyrdom must not be merely acknowledged as an independent incident ; he should be elevated into a figure of world importance			0
dr @entity8 was due to be released on friday after being arrested in @entity6 last year his name should be perpetuated posthumously , perhaps by awarding him the @entity139 , or putting his name to an institute for research on human rights , conflict resolution or countering radicalism			1
it would be a fitting tribute			0
i believe that the terrible story of his imprisonment , which included sadistic treatment and torture , demands a clear and uncompromising attitude from all who wish to avenge it and prevent continuing practices of this kind			0
world opinion must reflect the fact that dr @entity8 represents the best in universal values while at the same time intensifying an implacable and merciless fight against @entity96 and extremism			1
there must be no excuses for slacking in this respect			0
the treatment of this family man , tortured and killed in prison , defies description			2
i resent people telling me that it is something from the @entity173 ; it is not			0
the @entity173 included some highlights of civilisation			0
no , this is the @entity178 plus technology			0
dr @entity8 ’s appalling case destroys the myths of the @entity182			1
it shows everyone that @entity122 are on the same side as the rest of us in the fight for humanity and against extremism			0
this is not an argument based on partisanship for @entity194 , or a fear that @entity194 is threatened			0
@entity196 threatens other @entity122 and @entity197 even worse than it does the @entity198 because they can look after themselves			0
@entity194 can ward off these attacks			0
but the rest of the world is not sufficiently protected because it is confused			0
the media has a crucial role in pointing out this international threat , a role it has not yet played			0
dr @entity8 ’s death must therefore be a clarion call to ensure there are no limits in the fight against @entity96			1
day before his death @entity8 wrote to his family , including son @entity215 , saying he wanted to come home when you look at the excesses of the @entity219 , or the @entity221 torturers , even they were less brutal than the @entity96 , and less dangerous for one good reason : the @entity223 thinks he ’s got @entity224 in his pocket			2
the @entity226 and the @entity227 had @entity228 and @entity229 to look up to but the @entity96 claim to speak in the name of @entity224 , whether it be through their suicide bombers or their executions or their punishment amputations			0
one can not help feel that the so - called compromise over the dismantling of @entity6 ’s chemical weapons , brokered by @entity238 and accepted by @entity239 , is immoral			2
it ensures for @entity242 immunity from either military intervention or support in favour of the opposition – purely in exchange for the surrender of a chemical arsenal			0
an analogy would be the police saying to a mass murderer : ‘ look , if you ’re prepared to show us where you keep your really sophisticated weaponry we promise that you can carry on killing in the old traditional way			0
’ in effect it means that @entity242 can continue undisturbed , supported by @entity261 and @entity262 arms , to massacre women and children and almost certainly achieve victory			0
' one can not help feel that the so - called compromise over the dismantling of @entity6 's chemical weapons , brokered by @entity238 and accepted by @entity239 , is immoral ' numerous voices from the opposition are now expressing their regret at ever having taken up arms in the light of the failing support from the free world			2
of course , the very convincing argument now put forward is that @entity242 is no worse – in some ways he may be better – than the radical extremists he is fighting			0
today the situation is so terrible we do n’t know which side is worse			0
but the point must be made that all this might have been prevented had the @entity280 , notably @entity239 , intervened at the outset ; for instance , imposing a no - fly zone and guarding the porous frontiers against the influx of such extreme elements as @entity56			0
the least we should achieve now in honouring the memory of dr @entity8 is to ensure that the barbarous acts against him and others are treated as a priority by all mankind			1
we must not hesitate in our battle against extremism .			0
