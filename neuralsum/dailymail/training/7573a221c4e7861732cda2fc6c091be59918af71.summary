@entity0 was teased about his linguistic capabilities but for once his team did the talking			1
a single strike by @entity5 translated into a much - needed win for @entity7 and a small degree of revenge for their boss			1
@entity0 was bombarded with abuse from @entity14 fans from the moment he emerged from the tunnel until hope had been squeezed from @entity19 ’s team			1
‘ where ’s your translator gone ? ’ they wanted to know , among other , less polite , questions			2
spurs , so often lacking fluency under the manager they lured from @entity28 ’s , actually produced a response to make the @entity30 proud and go into the international break within a goal of fourth - placed @entity33			1

it proves how congested the @entity44 is behind the top two			2
perhaps there is a @entity91 place for @entity0 to target			2
on this evidence , he is finally injecting solidity into the team			0
they were less creative in attack but @entity5 ’s second goal of the season ended a run of four @entity44 games without a win			1
‘ it was an emotional game for me , ’ said @entity0			1
it was a great 18 months for me and my family and it was a tough decision to leave			0
but i can understand the fans			0
‘ it does n’t change my feelings			0
i will always be grateful to the club and the people of @entity14			2
i am happy to be here and happy with the win			0
it was important to get the three points			0
’ @entity19 claimed the supporters ought to have shown more respect			0
‘ that ’s the reaction of the fans but i do n’t agree , ’ said the @entity14 boss			2
normally , respect is high in the @entity44			2
@entity0 did a great job at @entity14 and now he ’s the manager of @entity7			1
’ @entity19 , above all , was upset not to leave with a point			0
his team were committed and industrious and matched @entity7 in midfield but rarely looked like scoring in a game bookended by two chances missed by @entity76			1
the former was deflected wide by @entity48 and the latter squirted wide as he failed to convert a cross fizzed in from the left by @entity70			0
@entity48 left @entity42 on crutches , his right foot and ankle in a protective boot after a nasty @entity70 challenge in the first half			1
@entity70 left his studs up and @entity48 ’s leg twisted under impact			0
he will have a scan today to determine the damage			0
‘ it was a big hit , ’ admitted @entity0			2
@entity7 manager @entity0 ( right ) greets @entity14 boss @entity19 ( left ) in his first match against his former side @entity14 captain @entity68 chases @entity7 winger @entity55 ( @entity146 ) during the first half @entity7 full - back @entity147 ( r ) is upended by a firm challenge from @entity14 midfielder @entity73 @entity7 midfielder @entity58 ( right ) presses new @entity14 signing @entity74 @entity151 miles @entity7 114.2 71.0 @entity55 89 12.2 7.6 @entity53 90 11.1 6.9 @entity54 90 11.1 6.9 @entity14 110.1 68.4 @entity73 90 12.0 7.4 @entity71 90 11.4 7.1 @entity74 90 11.4 7.1 the contest was tight and aggressive , with the rhythm often disrupted by the need for medics to treat players — though @entity76 has an annoying habit of exaggerating contact , which the officials will soon catch on to			1
ultimately , it was about who would be most clinical and that was @entity7 , who must have been encouraged by a nervous performance by @entity66 , in stark contrast to the immaculate - as - ever @entity47			1
the game was only three minutes old when @entity70 cleared off his line to deny @entity168			2
@entity55 also went close , clipping a post with a slider from distance			0
it seemed a deliberate policy to test @entity66 with low shots from distance			1
the @entity176 goalkeeper rode his luck when he spilt an effort from @entity5 and saw it spin wide of the post , but was beaten five minutes before half - time			1
@entity59 and @entity58 linked up neatly on the left and @entity58 nursed the ball out to @entity5 , who smashed it low into the corner			1
@entity66 was beaten again seconds later when @entity7 sprang out of defence on a quick break launched by @entity55			1
@entity59 unzipped the defence to release @entity58 , who clipped a shot past the keeper but it thumped into a post and was scrambled away			1
@entity47 saved a free - kick by @entity74 before the interval and there was a curious incident soon after the restart , when @entity50 eased @entity76 off the ball with a shoulder and referee @entity85 awarded a foul			2
@entity58 has been involved in five of @entity7 ’s nine @entity44 goals this season			1
he has scored four and now set up one			0
it did n’t look like a foul but @entity50 was certainly the last man by some considerable distance			0
if @entity85 thought it was a foul he should have shown the red card			0
@entity19 seemed to agree , but added : ‘ i think a yellow is ok			0
’ he was in dangerous territory here , considering how he stayed on after a last - man foul on @entity213 and then scored against @entity176 as they were denied a place at the @entity215 in 1994			2
it almost worked in @entity14 ’s favour when @entity50 sliced a clearance to @entity72 on the edge of the box , but @entity47 preserved the lead with a good save			2
@entity0 faced the @entity14 for the first time since his departure in the summer			1
@entity224 runs the rule over how he coped			0
reception : not good at all			0
noisily jeered by @entity14 fans as he emerged from the tunnel and the target for plenty of verbals in the first half - hour			1
‘ who the f * * * is @entity0 , ’ they sang , ‘ @entity236 , ’ and ‘ where ’s your translator gone ? ’ there was a barrage of x-rated abuse whenever he stood up and ventured to the edge of the pitch			2
in all this time , there was little by way of positive support from the @entity7 fans			1
body language : defiant and untroubled			0
having ditched his @entity7 tracksuit for his sunday best , @entity0 stood with his back to the visiting fans early in the game , anxiously passing messages on to the pitch as his team started slowly			1
once they were ahead , he relaxed			0
only occasionally did he seem exasperated , usually when possession had been surrendered cheaply , and he embraced those he replaced as they came off			0
@entity261 : it took @entity7 time to impose their style on the game			1
the two teams , both under orders to press , seemed to neutralise each other			0
defences were strong and chances were rare			0
spurs created the better ones and looked more solid , helped by the fact @entity47 was faultless as usual while @entity66 was clumsy and errorprone and @entity5 found a gem to win the game			1
@entity14 goalkeeper @entity66 puts in a despairing dive to try and save @entity5 's shot but could n't reach out his right hand far enough the @entity281 playmaker wheels away after scoring the only goal of the game at @entity42 @entity0 ( c ) reacts during the game as the former @entity14 manager was given a hard time by @entity14 fans @entity5 finished off a neat move to give @entity7 the lead , as our graphic ( below ) shows			1
