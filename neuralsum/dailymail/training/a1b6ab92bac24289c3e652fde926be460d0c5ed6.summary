@entity0 has had a tough time recently			0
not only has she ' consciously uncoupled ' from husband @entity2 , but she 's had to approve of his new girlfriend , @entity3			1
it is perhaps then unsurprising that the a-lister has been looking for alternative remedies to help her through her woes			0
the star , who recently claimed that water has feelings and called in a psychic to help her to ‘ heal and expand ’ , has this week been seeking the advice of an acupuncturist			1
alternative remedies : @entity0 has this week shared her views on acupuncture , which she says has helped her through ' many an ailment ' writing on her weekly @entity19 , the 42 - year - old explains : ' one day , when being treated by an acupuncturist , a @entity21 friend who was visiting me in @entity23 walked into the room and remarked that i looked like a bull who ’d had a run in with the picadores ( the dudes on horseback who stick the bull with many little knives to rile him up before the actual fight )			1
' i assured her that although i was stuck with needles , i was faring far better than the bull would in the analogous scenario			1
in fact , those many little needles have helped me through many an ailment			1
' the mother - of - two , who swears by a vegan diet and plenty of yoga , explains to her readers that eastern medicine has a different approach to @entity49 medicine because , she says , it ’s more holistic			1
she said : ' the root of the problem is addressed , as opposed to a symptom being attended to with prescription medication , only to return			0
do n’t get me wrong , i am thankful as hell for a round of antibiotics or surgery when necessary , but i have been helped tremendously by all of the practices that help the body heal itself			1
when implemented by a professional with experience , the benefits can work wonders			0
' clean living : the mother - of - two , who swears by a vegan diet and plenty of yoga , explains to her readers that eastern medicine has a different approach to @entity49 medicine because , she says , it 's more holistic the health aficionado also cites goji berries with chrysanthemum flowers , which she brews into a tea and drinks to her calm her red , dry eyes , as one of her favourite alternative remedies			1
explaining the bizarre treatment , the actress writes : ' goji berries are all the rage now , @entity83 sells them and i have even seen them covered in chocolate ! ( i do not recommend the chocolate - covered ones			1
) ' in fact , @entity81 ’ health properties are greatly enhanced by cooking them five to ten minutes			0
throw them into your hot cereal , soups or even tea			0
a very nice tea full of @entity97 ( the natural way ) is chrysanthemum and goji berry tea			1
both of these foods happen to be good for the eyes as well			0
' the star tackles the dreaded time of the month cramps with a mug of ginger tea with raw brown sugar and swears by dry body brushing			2
healing : acupuncture is an ancient treatment first practised in @entity113 around 1,000 years ago			2
it arrived in @entity115 in the 17th century , but it 's really only since the 1970s that there has been strong public interest in it despite their marital troubles , @entity0 and @entity2 have proved that they are still very friendly with each other , and are perhaps the most civilised ex-partners in showbiz			2
the two stars stepped out for dinner together with their family at a sushi restaurant in @entity130 on wednesday evening , and shared an affectionate farewell as @entity0 stroked @entity2 's face			2
@entity0 and @entity2 - who have two children together , daughter @entity134 and son @entity136 - have been spotted together on several occasions since their split in march this year , although both have moved on to other relationships			2
musician @entity2 , who organised @entity0 's recent birthday bash , has been seeing @entity142 starlet @entity3 for a few months , and @entity0 is reportedly seeing @entity144 's co-creator @entity143 in august			2
still pals : @entity0 and @entity2 have proved that they are still very friendly with each other , and are perhaps the most civilised ex-partners in showbiz , by eating out regularly together an ancient treatment first practised in @entity113 around 1,000 years ago			0
it arrived in @entity115 in the 17th century , but it 's really only since the 1970s that there has been strong public interest in it			0
how does it work ? the traditional @entity113 view is that energy - or ' @entity156 ' - flows directly through 12 main channels , called meridians , in the body and if the flow is interrupted it can cause ill - health			1
inserting tiny needles and manipulating them at ' trigger points ' restores the flow of energy			0
it is believed the needles stimulate skin and muscle nerves , releasing the body 's natural painkillers - endorphins and serotonin - into the pain pathways of the spinal cord and the brain to modify the way pain signals are received			1
it may also have beneficial effects on the nervous system , muscle tone , hormone production and circulation , as well as breathing , digestion and fertility			0
what is it used to treat ? some people have acupuncture to ' strengthen ' their constitution			0
but it is commonly used for anxiety , asthma , arthritis , depression , high blood pressure , infertility , menstrual problems , migraines , rheumatism , skin conditions and ulcers .			0
