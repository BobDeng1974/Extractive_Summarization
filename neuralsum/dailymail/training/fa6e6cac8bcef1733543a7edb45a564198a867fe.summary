by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter @entity4 ' @entity3 , 89 , is accused of aided and abetted in the deaths of 216,000 @entity6 while he was a guard at the @entity8 death camp an 89 - year - old @entity10 man has been ordered held without bail on a @entity13 arrest warrant charging that he aided and abetted in the deaths of 216,000 @entity6 while he was a guard at the @entity8 death camp			1
@entity16 authorities arrested retired toolmaker @entity17 on tuesday			1
he spent the night in custody and appeared frail during a detention hearing in federal court on wednesday , where he wore an olive green prison jumpsuit and carrying a cane			0
a district court in @entity25 , @entity26 , issued a warrant for @entity3 's arrest earlier this week , charging him with 158 counts of complicity in the commission of murder			1
each count represents a trainload of @entity26 prisoners from @entity37 , @entity26 and @entity38 who were killed at @entity39 between may 1944 and october 1944 , the documents said			2
@entity3 was born in 1925 in what was then @entity38 to an ethnic @entity13 father and an @entity16 mother , @entity43 , who was born in @entity10			1
@entity44 became a separate state in 1939 under the influence of @entity26			2
in 1942 , the @entity47 embarked on a drive to recruit ethnic @entity13 there and @entity3 joined at age 17			1
the fact he was a minor at the time was critical in the 2003 decision to allow him to stay in the @entity16			0
@entity3 has admitted he was a guard at @entity8 in occupied @entity72 during @entity63 , but has always claimed he was stationed outside of the @entity39 death camp part of the complex and had nothing to do with the wholesale slaughter of about 1.5 million @entity6 and others behind the gates			1
in a 2012 interview at his modest row house in northeastern @entity10 , @entity3 acknowledged that he was in the @entity47 at @entity8 but that he never served at the part of the camp responsible for the extermination of @entity6			1
suspected @entity26 prison guard @entity17 , lives at this @entity10 home , pictured center , along with his wife			1
he moved to the @entity16 in the 1950s during the interview , @entity3 said he had recently suffered three ' mini-strokes ' , but he was cogent and clear as he talked about his past for more than an hour			1
' i did n't kill anybody , i did n't rape anybody , and i do n't even have a traffic ticket here , ' he said			0
' i did n't do anything wrong			0
' he said he was aware of what was going on inside the death camp , but did not witness it himself			2
' we could only see the outside , the gates , ' he said			0
but the @entity106 takes issue with @entity3 's version of events and extradition papers state that @entity111 carried out ' rotating duties ' focused on preventing the escape of predominantly @entity6 prisoner - deportees			1
' @entity117 's @entity116 guards had rotating duties , all of which were focused on preventing the escape of the predominantly @entity6 prisoner - deportees : general guard duty , duty on the watchtowers , large and small chains of guards around the camp , supervision and guarding of the prisoners marched outside the camp for forced labor , and stand - by alert duty for the arrival of prisoners at the train ramp inside the @entity130 where the ' selection ' process occurred , ' states @entity3 's extradition papers			1
this photo from january 1945 shows @entity6 at the @entity8 concentration camp in @entity72 , where @entity141 is said to have been a guard following his arrest , @entity3 's attorney @entity143 argued his client is now too infirm to be detained pending a hearing on his possible extradition to @entity26			1
@entity3 has mild dementia and heart issues and has previously suffered strokes , @entity143 said			0
' mr. @entity3 is not a threat to anyone , ' said @entity143			0
' he 's not a flight risk			0
' but magistrate judge @entity154 ruled the detention center was equipped to care for @entity3 , who appeared to comprehend questions about the nature of the hearing			2
a law enforcement officer also testified @entity3 and his elderly wife grasped what was happening during his arrest on tuesday outside their home in northeast @entity10			1
' they both understood , ' deputy marshal @entity164 said			0
' it was n't news to them			0
' this image obtained from the @entity169 shows a @entity16 army intelligence card on @entity4 ' @entity3 , indicating he served in @entity8 as of dec 29 , 1944 , four months after he says he deserted this document provided by the @entity16 @entity172 shows a copy of a world war 2 - era record of @entity3 's employment as an @entity8 camp guard in @entity39 @entity3 has been under investigation by prosecutors in the @entity180 town of @entity25 , near where he last lived in @entity26			1
the @entity183 file , obtained by the @entity2 from the @entity169 through a @entity185 request , is significant because judges in 2003 said @entity3 's testimony on desertion was part of what convinced them that his service with the @entity47 after turning 18 might not have been voluntary , further mitigating his wartime responsibility			0
@entity3 testified in @entity16 court that he served as a perimeter guard at @entity39 , which was largely for prisoners used as slave laborers , though it also had a makeshift gas chamber used early in the war ; it was also the camp where @entity47 doctor @entity202 carried out sadistic experiments on inmates			1
but he denied ever serving in @entity8 , better known as @entity39 , the death camp area where the bulk of the people were killed			1
he also said he deserted in august , 1944 and never returned to the camp , though he eventually rejoined his unit fighting outside @entity209 in the final weeks of the war			0
also weighing in @entity3 's favor with the judges was his testimony that he refused to have the @entity47 tattoo ; he does not have such a mark today or evidence that one was removed			0
this undated file image shows the main gate of the @entity26 concentration camp @entity72 , which was liberated by the @entity221 in january 1945 @entity222 , a former federal prosecutor with the special office that investigates @entity26 war crimes in @entity26 , now represents family members of some of @entity3 's alleged victims as co-plaintiffs in the case			1
he called for a speedy extradition			0
' the @entity13 court has to find late justice for the crimes of @entity3 and for the victims and their sons and daughters as co-plaintiffs , ' @entity222 wrote			2
' it is late , but not too late			0
' the investigation comes after years of failed @entity16 efforts to have @entity3 stripped of his @entity16 citizenship and deported			2
a court ruling in 2003 allowed him to stay in the @entity16 , mainly on the grounds that he had joined the @entity47 as a minor and could therefore not be held legally responsible for participation in it			0
his @entity16 citizenship stems from the fact his mother was born in the @entity16 ; she later moved to @entity248 , where @entity3 was born			1
victims of the @entity8 death camp stand on the platform at @entity252 during @entity63 during @entity3 's arrest on tuesday , he asked the marshals to retrieve papers in his home that document his right to stay in the @entity16 , @entity164 testified			1
@entity3 's wife and two grandsons attended the hour - long hearing in @entity10			1
his extradition hearing is scheduled for august 21			2
@entity262 , the head @entity26 hunter at the @entity263 in @entity264 , said he hoped there would be no obstacles to @entity3 's extradition and trial overseas			2
' @entity26 deserves credit for doing this - for extending and expanding their efforts and , in a sense , making a final attempt to maximize the prosecution of @entity276 perpetrators , ' he said in a telephone interview from @entity264			0
experts estimated in 2012 that at least 80 former camp guards or others who would fall into the same category are likely still alive today , almost 70 years after the end of the war			0
@entity284 carries out an inspection of the @entity288 - @entity287 plant at @entity8 in july 1942 by treaty , the @entity16 can extradite its citizens to @entity26			2
but @entity3 said in 2012 that he would fight any attempts to take him away from the @entity16 and his wife and family			2
' i 'm an @entity16 citizen , just as if i had been born here , ' he said at the time			0
' they ca n't deport me			0

@entity16 authorities arrested @entity4 ' @entity3 , a retired toolmaker in @entity10 on tuesday
the previous day a court in @entity26 had issued a warrant for his arrest
he is accused of aided and abetted in the deaths of 216,000 @entity6 while he was a guard at the @entity8 death camp
@entity3 has admitted he was a guard during @entity63 , but has always claimed he was stationed outside of the death camp
but his extradition papers state that @entity71 's @entity111 carried out ' rotating duties '
