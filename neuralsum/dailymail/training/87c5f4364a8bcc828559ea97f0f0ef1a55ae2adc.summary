when @entity2 made his way out of the draw hall in @entity5 , @entity1 ’s director of football wondered out loud why he bothered to make the short hop to @entity7			2
for @entity9 ’s team to go deep into the @entity10 , @entity1 must overcome one of the most feared forward lines in the history of the game			0
they were beaten , well beaten as it happens , over two legs by the brilliance of @entity18 and his @entity20 team at this stage of the competition last season			2
@entity24 vs @entity25 @entity1 vs @entity20 @entity26 vs @entity27 @entity28 vs @entity29 @entity32 vs @entity30 @entity33 vs @entity34 @entity35 vs @entity36 @entity37 vs @entity38 first legs to be played on february 17/18 and 24/25			1
second legs on march 10/11 and 17/18			0
the @entity10 trophy on display at the last 16 draw in @entity5 , @entity7 on monday @entity45 general secretary @entity44 pulls @entity1 out of the pot during the last 16 draw @entity18 flicks the ball past @entity1 goalkeeper @entity49 to score for @entity20 in last season 's tie ‘ it ’s unbelievable , ’ admitted @entity2 , who left his position as director of football at the @entity54 to join @entity1 in 2012			1
‘ we do n’t need to come to the draw because it ’s the same every time			0
we faced @entity34 and @entity59 in the group phase and now we have to deal with @entity20 again , like last season			1
’ this time there is an added twist , the first time @entity66 football has seen @entity67 since the forward quit @entity69 in the summer for £ 75million			0
it is dreamy stuff and the presence of @entity67 , who scored 31 times for @entity69 in their battle with @entity1 for last season ’s @entity75 , guarantees an edge to the two fixtures			2
@entity67 has got off to a slow start at the @entity54 following his ban for sinking his teeth into @entity82 at the @entity83 , but had great success in @entity85 and he will be a real danger			0
@entity87 and @entity88 look dejected after @entity20 score in last season 's first leg at the @entity92 the draw has thrown up some intriguing clashes and @entity35 will fancy their chances of progressing to the next phase after successfully avoiding one of the giants of @entity100 football			1
@entity36 is where @entity101 really got going as a coach , winning the @entity105 league in 1988 and he will return to the @entity106 to face his former club			1
@entity1 are certainly going about it the hard way in @entity45 after @entity111 ’s remarkable hat - trick against @entity34 and their dramatic win in @entity113			1
they will play at the @entity114 and then travel to the @entity54 to face @entity116 ’s side			2
that tie is three weeks later as the last - 16 draw is so strung out			0
@entity1 @entity119 february 18 , 2014 last 16 , first leg - @entity1 0 @entity20 2 march 12 , 2014 last 16 , second leg - @entity20 2 @entity1 1 @entity24 @entity120 september 14 , 2004 @entity121 - @entity24 0 @entity25 3 november 24 , 2004 @entity25 0 @entity24 0 april 2 , 2014 quarter - final , first leg - @entity24 3 @entity25 1 april 8th , 2014 quarter - final , second leg - @entity25 2 @entity24 0 @entity125 @entity124 no previous competitive meetings a screen in the hall at @entity45 headquarters in @entity5 shows the results of the last 16 draw the draw has not been kind to @entity1 , but the bigwigs expected as much after finishing runners - up to @entity135 ’s @entity34			1
still , they are facing a side which has been beaten twice in @entity137 this season and are trailing @entity30 in the table by four points			2
despite the brilliance of @entity18 and the improving @entity142 , they do not have the allure of the 2006 , 2009 or 2011 @entity10 - winning teams			0
on a good day , @entity1 can beat them			0
finishing second in the group makes it a tougher tournament to win , but both of @entity152 ’s successes in the @entity10 came when he finished as a runner - up			0
his @entity25 team coasted through their group this season and the reward is another clash with @entity24			1
it means a return to @entity161 for @entity162 , the man once described by @entity85 coach @entity163 as a ‘ @entity165 footballer ’			0
@entity162 , a member of @entity25 ’s @entity10 - winning team under @entity167 in 2012 , was sold by @entity152 in may for a staggering £ 50m			1
@entity168 celebrates after scoring during last season 's @entity25 vs @entity24 match at @entity161 although his relationship with @entity152 deteriorated in his final months at @entity161 , the @entity172 defender is guaranteed a warm reception when he returns to @entity175			2
this is the draw @entity152 claimed he wanted when his team finished top of @entity179 with a comfortable 3 - 1 victory over @entity181 last week			2
@entity24 were beaten 3 - 1 in their final group game when the holy trinity — @entity18 , @entity142 and @entity67 — scored for @entity20 in the @entity54 last week			1
@entity185 ’s @entity105 champions are struggling to find their rhythm and were beaten 1 - 0 by lowly @entity187 at the weekend			0
he will do well to still be in a job when they face @entity25			0
last season @entity25 were well - beaten in @entity190 , prompting @entity152 to shake hands with the entire @entity24 bench after @entity194 ’s injury time goal made it 3 - 1			1
13/5 @entity34 @entity195 6/1 @entity20 7/1 @entity25 @entity196 @entity197 @entity35 @entity24 28/1 @entity29 , @entity28 @entity38 100/1 @entity26 @entity36 , @entity37 200/1 @entity33 @entity198 six days later , when @entity25 got them back to @entity200 , @entity152 took off on a memorable touchline dash after substitute @entity168 put them through on away goals with an 87th - minute strike			1
they were beaten in the semi-final by @entity27 , but the latter stages of this tournament are the target for all three @entity66 teams			0
@entity35 , who finished second in their group behind @entity29 , have a decent chance of making progress			2
@entity125 rely on the creaking bones of former @entity25 defender @entity216 and then there is the enigma that is the former @entity219 forward @entity220 up front			0
there was a touch of romance and more than a hint of pragmatism when @entity101 asked for the @entity10 gods to pit his recovering @entity35 side against his former club			1
he got his wish , but now they have to find a way through			0
@entity35 manager @entity101 will come up against his former club @entity36 in the round of 16 @entity235 here to @entity238 's facebook page .			1
