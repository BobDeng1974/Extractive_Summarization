@entity7 is lucky to be alive after he triggered the snowslide while skiing off - piste this weekend			2
the video of his dangerous ride was filmed with a camera mounted on his helmet , and shows how mr @entity7 finds himself in the middle of the avalanche , but manages to stay on the surface thanks to his airbag			1
the snowslide is set off by mr @entity7 and comes down with full power as he jumps off a cliff			0
the view is obstructed as the mass of snow encompasses mr @entity7 , with only the tip of his skis visible			0
fortunately mr @entity7 was wearing a backpack airbag designed to aid skiers caught in avalanches , but he says the outcome could have been very different for someone who would not have been prepared			2
@entity41 : mr @entity7 takes off down the untouched slope despite avalanche warnings dramatic shot : the helmet camera captures the ride as the snow begins to break behind underneath him final breath : mr @entity7 jumps off the cliff and heads straight into the avalanche , triggered by his movements down the slope ' i saw it fracture and i just tried to straight line it over the cliff and instantly deploy my air bag , ’ @entity7 told @entity59			1
‘ the road was only 300 yards away and there were tons of people up there snowshoeing and having a good time that do n’t have any beacons , that do n’t have any avalanche gear			0
’ ‘ maybe i was in a little bit more of a risky zone , obviously , but it just shows that a lot of things can slide with not a lot impact on them and they can go big right now , ’ @entity7 said			2
@entity77 : mr @entity7 is engulfed by a cloud of snow as the avalanche surrounds him saved by the bag : just as mr @entity7 is about to be buried in the snow , he inflates his backpack - airbag , which brigs him to the surface avalanche airbags are designed for off - piste skiers and mountain climbers who risk finding themselves in such conditions			1
