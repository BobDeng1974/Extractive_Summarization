when @entity1 was a teenager trying to make his way through the @entity3 , an emergency meeting was called at the club to discuss his future			2
@entity3 coaches fought for @entity1 to be given a professional contract , others at the club felt he was too slight and small and had no future in the tough hard world of professional football			2
the academy coaches won , and @entity1 has since commanded big money moves first from @entity3 to @entity15 for almost £ 10million , and then on to @entity16 for up to £ 20m			1
but in his three years at @entity16 he has convinced nobody that he is comfortable at that level			2
worse than that he has a reputation as a diver , which might make those supportive academy coaches squirm after they backed him so much in his youth			2
and now record - breaking @entity27 is on his way to @entity23 for a huge fee – that ’s how desperate @entity16 are for quality out wide			1
never mind @entity55 , @entity27 might as well be the @entity56 as far as @entity1 is concerned			1
propping up the bar at the last chance saloon at @entity38 on sunday , @entity1 had the opportunity to stake one last claim in front of @entity62			1
but as cross after cross went straight to an opposition player , time was surely called on @entity1 ’s big club adventure			1
track record : @entity1 sends himself sprawling to the ground under pressure from @entity72 's @entity71 in 2012 tumble : @entity1 goes down in the box playing for @entity74 against @entity75 in a 2010 @entity77 qualifier not only can you question whether @entity1 is good enough to be a wing - back under @entity80 at @entity16 , you can ask if he is even good enough to be on the wing			1
if it is to be the end of @entity1 ’s time at @entity16 he will only be remembered as a diver			1
his @entity74 career already appears to be finished – he has n’t played for almost a year for @entity88 ’s side			1
he will go down as one of many @entity74 players to have missed a penalty in a shootout at a tournament			0
@entity1 nearly broke the crossbar from the spot in @entity96 in @entity97			0
there are many examples of @entity101 players who have promised so much but ultimately delivered so little			0
he was showcasing his talents superbly until he moved to @entity16			0
out of patience : @entity62 has given @entity1 a chance to impress him but he has n't taken it at that point , his wages rocketed , and with sir @entity108 taking more of a back seat before retiring , there was less and less pressure to perform			1
the imagination and creativity he played with at @entity15 seemed to evaporate from his game , and frankly he now looks ordinary			0
@entity114 , especially after all the support he received when he was given so much support as a youth team player at @entity3			0
those coaches who believed in him back then will wonder where the hunger went			0
unfortunately , @entity1 is not the only @entity101 talent to hit a ceiling , and fail to break through it			0
he ’s not the only one at @entity16 either			0
like our @entity16 facebook page here .			0

arrival of @entity27 will spell the end of @entity1 's time at @entity16
@entity1 wasted his last chance to impress @entity62 at @entity38 on sunday but wasted cross after cross
his @entity74 career also appears to be finished having not played for a year
@entity1 's reputation as a diver also counts against him
