by @entity0 published : 18:25 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 01:43 est , 1 august 2013 if your name is @entity3 and you have a husband named @entity5 , a semi-detached house and drive a @entity7 the chances are you are not alone			0
you are in fact the @entity11 ’s @entity10 and like a significant proportion of the country , the pair of you share a mortgage on your 1970s three bedroom home and look forward to holidays in the @entity19			2
new data from insurers @entity21 have pin - pointed the most typical @entity11 households and even narrowed it down by generation			0
mr & mrs average : a study has shed new light on what life is like for most people who live in modern @entity11			1
pictured , the fairly typical @entity32 family from @entity33 show outnumbered so if you are aged between 45 and 54 you ’re most likely to be called either @entity34 or @entity35			1
you will probably live in a detached or semi-detached house and drive a @entity38 and go on holidays in @entity40			2
your children , if they are aged 18 - 25 , will most likely be called @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 or @entity46 and drive @entity47 , live in flats and go on mini breaks to @entity50 or @entity51			1
and at the other end of the scale your parents are most likely to be called @entity55 and @entity56 and they live in a bungalow and cruise around in a @entity59			1
the @entity11 ’s largest insurer studied a million of their customers in an effort to work out the most common names , cars , homes and holidays based on age certain brackets			1
@entity7 : if you drive one of these , the chances are you are called @entity3 and are married to a chap called @entity5 what they found appears to be proof of some astonishing generational trends			0
for example half of all people called @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity78 or @entity79 are aged 45 - 54 and three quarters of people called @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity82 and @entity83 are over 65			1
but it ’s not just names that define the generations , changing priorities and social trends appear to impact many people the same way , leading them to make very similar life choices			1
mini-breaks : @entity50 ( pictured ) and @entity51 are a favourite with the 18 - 25s the rise in popularity of cruises among older generations means it is by far the most popular holiday choice for those with grown - up children , with some 58 per cent of visitors to the @entity102 fjords over the age of 55			0
the data also reflects a pattern of life starting with young adults preferring cheaper flats , sporty cars and party holidays , to those in their 30s prioritising larger more comfortable houses and family beach holidays , and finally pensioners downsizing their properties and enjoying holidays closer to home			1
those under 34 are most likely to live in either a flat or a maisonette , with a third of all basement flats being occupied by someone between the age of 25 and 34			0
as young people settle down and earn better salaries they become more likely to drive a faster car and take more exotic holidays – four in 10 brits who visit @entity131 are 25 - 34 – before becoming parents changes the emphasis to more space at home and sensible utility vehicles			1
but there were also some unifying factors across the generations			0
most people said the age when they are most content was 32 and that changed very little regardless of the age of the individual at the time			2
@entity147 , marketing director at @entity21 said : ‘ the past decades have been a time of great change and it ’s fascinating to see these differences between the generations			0
‘ as trends have come and gone , we have whole age groups identifiable by their name , where they live , what they drive and where they holiday			0
‘ it shows a remarkable progression through life as we change from wanting lively holidays and nippy city cars to going on child - friendly beach breaks and driving family run - a - rounds , to preferring the quiet life with a cruise and a hatchback			2
' @entity21 provides insurance , savings and investment products to 14 million @entity130 and carried out their research in june 2013			0
@entity174 : if you are aged between 45 and 54 you will probably head for an altogether more exotic location such as this			0

study of one million reveals most common names , cars , homes and holidays
three quarters of people called @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity82 and @entity83 aged over 65
people say they were at their *happiest* when they were aged 32
