with a population of just 11million you may think that @entity4 can barely compete with @entity3 when it comes to the realm of culture , heritage and sporting success			1
yet @entity4 head into their round of 16 @entity14 clash against the @entity3 in @entity15 on tuesday evening as favourites to progress			1
the small @entity17 country are competing on an even keel with their opponents on the field and as @entity23 demonstrates below , their unique culinary and cultural tastes also shape up nicely against the financial might and global domination of their @entity3 counterparts			1

rare glory : @entity4 's @entity81 celebrates with @entity82 and @entity83 in 1986 finals winner : draw other sporting heroes @entity4 has not been a hotbed of sporting talent but highlights have come in the shape of female tennis stars @entity92 and @entity93 , who won a combined eleven grand slam titles in their singles ’ careers			1
they also boast arguably the greatest cyclist of all time , with the brilliant @entity100 ( below ) winning the @entity101 on five occasions at the beginning of the 1970 ’s			0
the @entity3 , however , have an array of globally recognised superstars , from @entity107 legend @entity106 to the world ’s most inspirational sportsman @entity108			2
when you throw in @entity3 ’s outstanding golfers , @entity112 and @entity113 , and athletes such as @entity115 , it becomes a list with which no country in the world would be able to compete			2
winner : @entity3 the wags the @entity3 captain @entity38 's wife @entity120 boasts a master ’s degree and is an educational psychologist			1
oh , and she also posed for a @entity124 shoot in 2010 wearing only body paint			0

earlier this year , the @entity4 winger revealed that his other half could make the final decision over his future with the @entity147 club , telling @entity148 : ‘ if my wife was to say : " honey , i 'd like you to go to @entity155 ( @entity155 ) " , i would have to take it into account			2
’ classy : @entity157 is the wife of @entity4 and @entity158 captain @entity136 put a ring on it : @entity161 is said to be engaged to beauty @entity162 winner : draw foodthe fast - food industry is not the preserve of the @entity3 , despite the industry bringing in an extraordinary $ 191billion in 2013			1
indeed , @entity169 fries , so popular in the states , in fact originate from @entity4			2
well , according to the @entity4 anyway			2
the history books claim that they were sliing up and frying potatoes as early as the 17th century as an alternative to fish when the rivers became icy and impenetrable in the winter			0
nowadays , @entity169 fries remain a national delight in @entity4 , where there are an abundance of friteries , where chips are the main delicacy on offer			2
moules - frites ( mussels and chips ) is the country ’s favourite dish , offering a variation on the @entity3 's hamburger and @entity169 fries or the @entity192 fish and chips			1
winner : @entity4 @entity194 is renowned for its beers , with @entity197 author @entity196 even writing a book called ‘ around @entity199 in 80 beers			2
’ our favourite is @entity203 , founded in 1871 and described as ‘ well - hopped , fruity and exceptionally aromatic ’			0
@entity204 opened a brewery with his wife and a process of trial - and - error created a beer that has become one of the most popular in @entity4			1
@entity203 ( translated into @entity211 as ‘ devil ’ ) takes ninety days to brew and has also made inroads into the @entity3 market			0
@entity215 12 and @entity216 also come highly recommended			0
over the @entity218 , @entity217 is the market leader , bringing in sales just under $ 6million in 2013 , according to a survey by bizjournals.com			0
@entity224 light , budweiser and @entity226 all trail in its wake			0
@entity4 prime minister @entity229 is certainly confident , tweeted his @entity3 counterpart : ‘ @entity231 , i am betting some great @entity4 beers that our @ @entity233 will make it to the quarter final ! :-) @entity238 # @entity237 ' winner : @entity4 politics the @entity4 prime minister @entity229 handed in his resignation to the @entity241 at the end of may but he has enjoyed reasonable levels of popularity during his period in power			1
he is seen as a symbol of @entity4 ’s progressive state , as the first prime minister of non-belgium descent ( he is the son of @entity251 immigrants ) while he has become the first openly gay prime minister in @entity17			0
the @entity3 , of course , have their own history - making president , after @entity36 was voted in as the country ’s first @entity197 leader in 2008			1
he was re-elected in 2012 , defeating his @entity260 challenger @entity259			0
flying high : @entity36 watched the @entity51 game from his airplane as @entity3 progressed winner : draw the @entity3 is home to some of the world ’s most iconic structures , from the @entity267 and the @entity268 , to the @entity270 sign , the @entity271 and @entity272			0
@entity4 , however , adopt a rather more tongue - in - cheek approach			2
in @entity199 , there is an almost 400 - year - old water feature called @entity276 , where a bronze statue of a little boy is seen urinating into a basin			0
they do have a rather serous heritage , though , with @entity199 considered as the de facto capital of the @entity283			0
‘ the @entity287 ’ by @entity288 and @entity289 was also written in @entity199 , becoming one of the planet ’s defining political manuscripts			0
@entity290 : the famous @entity276 water feature in @entity4 's capital ( left ) and dressed up in honor of the 10th anniversary of the end of apartheid and former @entity298 president @entity297 ( right ) winner : @entity3 @entity300 ’s have @entity299 and @entity301 , the @entity4 have @entity302 , with cartoonist @entity304 ’s comic strips becoming among the most iconic in @entity17 in the 20th century , translated into seventy languages from the original @entity169			1
signed off with his pen - name @entity304 , @entity304 recounted the tale of a young reporter @entity302 , who was nobly aided by his white wire fox terrier @entity309			0
for all @entity311 ’s exploits , though , the @entity4 may need a little more to compete with the global domination of @entity313 and his instantly recognisable productions			0
winner : @entity3 @entity316 : @entity3 3 belgium 2 ... ... but what 's going to happen in the real match ? the @entity4 squad is jam - packed with familiar faces , with twelve @entity322 stars on show , including @entity140 ’s @entity139 , @entity158 ’s @entity136 and @entity44 pair @entity324 and @entity43			1
it is hailed as a golden generation littered with attacking flair , as a host of young stars emerge onto the global stage			1
the @entity3 squad may be less familiar to the @entity333 audience , with only four @entity322 players : @entity335 of @entity336 , @entity337 of @entity338 and the two goalkeepers , @entity340 of @entity341 and @entity342 of @entity343			0
@entity344 : @entity4 star men : @entity194 playmaker @entity139 ( left ) and captain @entity136 ( right ) @entity344 : @entity3 strike ! @entity348 celebrates after netting against @entity66 drawing the 2 - 2 draw in @entity350 @entity351 : @entity4 's @entity352 ( left ) and @entity3 's @entity51 - born manager @entity353 only one member of the @entity3 squad played @entity357 football last season , as @entity360 youngster @entity359 made an injury - time cameo appearance in the group stage back in november			1
only three @entity4 players are based in their national league , compared to the nine @entity3 players that ply their trade in the @entity367 , as @entity353 ’s side battle against all expectations to reach the final eight of the @entity14 in @entity371			1
the @entity4 team head into the game with a 100 per cent record in @entity371 , after defeating @entity45 , @entity375 and @entity59 in their three group games , keeping two clean sheets in the process			2
they will , however , be hoping that their attacking players now join the party , with @entity382 and @entity139 still to score , with @entity4 scoring just four goals in three games			1
the @entity3 , meanwhile , captured the hearts of the global audience with a spirited showing to draw 2 - 2 with @entity388 ’s @entity66 and a victory over @entity390 was enough to ensure @entity3 ’s progress into the knockout stages of the competition			1
@entity394 has emerged as a serious force in the central midfield , while @entity342 and @entity348 have attracted the headlines with show - stopping moments			0
prediction : good luck @entity3 ... you 're going to need it !			0

@entity3 take on @entity4 in @entity14 last - 16 clash in @entity15 on tuesday
@entity353 hoping to *mastermind* @entity3 victory against @entity4 ' golden generation ' and win place in quarter - finals
@entity38 and @entity382 go head - to - head in key clash on the pitch
but two countries have huge cultural contrasts too
