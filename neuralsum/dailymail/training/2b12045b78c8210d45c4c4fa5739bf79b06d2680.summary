when it comes to keeping our cool on the roads , it seems we 're actually a bunch of hot - heads who do anything but keep calm			0
from drivers who do n't indicate , inconsiderate motorists who tailgate others and those who treat the roads like a racetrack , it seems there are many things that grind our gears			2
new statistics show that nearly half of all drivers have experienced a road rage incident , while ten per cent of people revealed they have been in a collision with a cyclist			1
and on top of losing our tempers behind the wheel apparently we do n't like to stick to the road rules either			2
the number of drivers that regularly exceed the speed limit is 23 percent , while drivers who drive too slow are also unfavourable people to share the asphalt with			1
on top of all that it seems we 're not afraid to voice our concerns as a third of motorists revealed they 've had another driver jump out of their car to confront them			0
one in ten motorists said they have been involved in a collision with a pushbike rider almost a quarter of drivers said they have left their car to confront another driver almost a quarter admitted to doing the yelling , with 22 per cent saying they had pulled over to lose it at a fellow driver			0
the survey also revealed we 're a dishonest bunch , with one in ten people admitting their have hit a parked car and fled the scene without leaving any of their insurance details			0
many passive - aggressive or just downright rude notes have gone viral online when posted by disgruntled drivers who discovered their car had been damaged in their absence			1

other things that get drivers revved up are drivers who do n't keep left unless overtaking , motorists using their phones to call or text while behind the wheel and the lack of a courtesy wave when being let in			0
aggressive drivers , people who are incapable of adjusting to weather conditions such as the rain , those who ca n't merge and others who simply drive downright dangerously also irk many motorists .			2
