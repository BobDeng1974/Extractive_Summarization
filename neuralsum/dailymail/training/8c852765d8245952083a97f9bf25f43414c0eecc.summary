by @entity0 published : 09:14 est , 16 april 2013 updated : 09:03 est , 18 april 2013 communities secretary @entity1 hoped the offer of a ' compromise ' on his planning reforms would avert a rebellion among @entity6 and @entity7 mps @entity1 has been forced into a humiliating climbdown over his plans to allow homeowners to build huge extensions without planning permission			1
following a revolt by @entity6 and @entity7 backbenchers , the @entity1 yesterday promised to water down his unpopular proposals in a bid to avoid outright defeat when the legislation faced a @entity20 vote			1
despite his efforts , 16 @entity21 and eight @entity7 still voted against the @entity23 yesterday			0
many more abstained , cutting the @entity25 ’s majority to just 27			2
the embarrassing u-turn throws into disarray the government ’s ‘ planning free - for - all ’ which is aimed at boosting the building trade			0
it enables homeowners to build 26ft extensions in their garden without planning permission , doubling the current limit			1
opponents have slammed mr @entity1 ’ proposals as neighbours and local councils would be powerless to object to unsightly developments			1
no details have yet been released about the compromise promised by mr @entity1 , but rebels – led by @entity6 mp @entity44 – have warned they will have no hesitation in voting against the revised plans if they are not good enough			1
on monday night , planning minister @entity47 launched a last - minute bid to persuade rebels to drop their opposition to the proposals by inviting them to face - to - face meetings			2
but his attempts ended in failure , forcing mr @entity1 to announce his climbdown yesterday			0
during a fractious debate in the @entity20 , @entity6 mp after @entity6 mp stood up to condemn the reforms			1
@entity59 said : ‘ we ’ve heard about monstrous carbuncles			0
i think we could end up with a lot of small warts on properties			0
’ under the government 's reforms , the size of single - storey extensions which can be built without planning permission would double to up to 8metres @entity70 said it was ‘ potentially going to be extremely divisive in communities ’ , while @entity73 said : ‘ we have seldom had a situation where so many conservative councillors and councils and other bodies have united to say this is very bad legislation			1
it offends against the principle of localism			0
’ the commons vote was on an amendment to the @entity84 put forward by the @entity85 that allows councils to opt out of the planning changes limits , which the government wanted to reject			1
the @entity89 said it was disappointed the @entity20 had voted against the amendment			0
councillor @entity92 , chairman of its environment and housing board , said : ‘ it is hugely disappointing that mps have failed to listen to the concerns of their constituents and councils and voted against this common - sense amendment and local opt - out			2
anti plan : @entity44 , conservative mp , will vote against the law which will double the length of extensions that people can build in their gardens without planning permission ‘ imposing this home extensions free - for - all on the whole country will risk opening the floodgates to thousands of unsightly and unsuitable extensions which could create disputes between neighbours			1
’ responding to the barrage of criticism , mr @entity1 said : ‘ we will bring forward a revised approach on the contentious question of permitted development rights for home extensions when the @entity84 returns to the @entity85			0
’ but mr @entity44 said the opt - out for councils was ‘ in itself a modest amendment ’			2
he added : ‘ it is hard to know what further compromise the government might accept			0
’ details of the compromise will be unveiled in the coming days , with a vote in the @entity85 next week and another in the @entity20 a few days later .			0
