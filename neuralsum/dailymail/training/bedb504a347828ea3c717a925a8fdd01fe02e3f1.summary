astonishingly , @entity0 insists she can not go back to work because she would not be able to earn enough to cover the cost of their current lifestyle			2
for his part , @entity1 says his debilitating migraines have prevented him from returning to work for the past two decades			2
since the story broke , the two have come under fire for saying claiming benefits is ' too easy ' and that they are better off on handouts than they would be working for a living			0
but this morning , the couple hit back at critics who have called them ' scroungers '			0
' we can see why people are angry , but it 's the government 's fault ' : @entity1 and partner @entity0 appear on @entity27 this morning to defend their £ 50k @entity35 handouts in the interview , screened this morning on @entity62 , @entity60 asked @entity0 what she would say to those who have lashed out at her for claiming benefits she has admitted she does not need			1
her reply ? that both she and @entity1 have ' had their time working '			2
' i have worked full time , ' @entity0 says			2
' i 've had my time working			0
when my eldest son was two weeks old			0
i went back to work , because i had a mortgage , i had a house			0
i could n't afford not to			0
@entity1 has worked full time , @entity1 has paid lots of tax			1
' but you 're not working now , ' @entity60 points out			0
' we are not currently , ' @entity0 agrees			2
' i gave up work before i met @entity1 because i had three children under 5 and i could n't work and afford childcare			1
' ' the plan for the last 18 months has been i want to go to work			0
' however , i ca n't get a job that 's going to cover my rent , my council tax and my bills			1
for @entity1 's part , he says he worked ' straight ' from 1969 to 1992 until he was forced to give up his job after collapsing while at the welding machine at the firm where he worked			1
he says that every three weeks he has to spend three or four days in bed with serious migraines and has n't been able to work since			0
' i did n't want to leave my job , ' he says			0
' they made me give my job up , they said it was just too dangerous			0
' ' there will be people watching who say you have every right to have as many children as you wish , but you ca n't expect the public to pay for them , which is what 's happening now , @entity27 's @entity98 says			1
shameless : @entity0 , 28 , centre , pictured with partner @entity1 , 56 , and their ten children - @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 - says she knows she is taking advantage of the benefits system - but blames the government for making it ' so easy ' @entity1 replies : ' we agree with that			1
@entity0 works 40 hours in a week in a charity shop to get experience so that she can get a job [ @entity0 says she volunteers in order to get experience and to meet people , and so her children are instilled with a good work ethic ]			1
' but what people do n't understand is that our housing benefit [ the two receive £ 1,700 a month , or £ 20,400 a year ] goes straight to the landlord			1
people think we are getting the money but we 're not			0
@entity1 goes on to explain that their house , owned by a private landlord , has a much higher rent payable than the £ 400 they would need to pay for a council house			1
therefore , their housing benefits need to be correspondingly much higher to pay their landlord			1
the benefits system allows for this , setting high rent caps that critics have slammed as extortionate , especially for larger properties like the privately rented house the government has allocated to the @entity29 family live in			1
@entity60 asks @entity1 what he would say to the taxpayers who are paying for him and his family to live in their five bedroom house in @entity34 and their lifestyle			1
' they are funding your life , ' she says			0
' what would you say to them ? ' @entity0 , who is mother to three of the children from a previous marriage and step - mother to seven of @entity1 's children , interjects , saying that they have ' paid their way ' previously			1
' we have also contributed to that			0
we have both paid taxes , ' she says			0
not at the moment , but in the past			0
and i want to contribute again			0
' i want to come off of benefits and i want to go to work full time			0
it 's the system that is stopping me			2
' ' it 's somewhere higher up in the government that 's stopped me from doing it			2

' ' nevertheless , ' @entity98 says , ' many of our viewers will say 50k a year is probably twice as much as people watching this programme actually earn doing a full time job			2
' they find it an affront , although it 's perfectly legitimate , what you are claiming , and an affront that you are able to get that from the @entity35			0
' ' i understand why people are angry , ' @entity0 says			1
' i 'm saying , if i had a council house , my rent would be £ 400 a month , and i could cover that			1
i could work to cover that and i would n't be on benefits any more			0
' i need someone to help me to come off the benefits system			2
then i will be back out working			0
i will be working to help support other people who have children			2
' @entity60 steps in once more , asking @entity0 what her children make of their lifestyle			2
' does it worrying you that they are seeing you living off benefits ? ' she asks			0
' all the children think @entity0 get paid for her job , ' @entity1 says			1
' but she does n't , ' @entity60 says			0
@entity1 goes on , saying his children are well - educated , well - behaved , and nothing like the ' typical ' children people expect those on benefits to have			1
' all my children have 100 per cent attendance at school , ' he says			0
' all of them are going to have good careers			0
' my oldest wants to be a doctor in the @entity242			0
none of my children roam the streets			0
they are not the typical children that people would think people like us have			2
' going back to the contentious subject of the housing benefit the two claim , @entity1 speaks out against the government 's use of expensive private landlords , saying that if they could have a council house , they would not be trapped within the benefits system			1
' to me , if we could have a house that cost £ 400 a month , we 'd be fine , ' he says			1
as for @entity0 , she believes the children will look at their life of hardship and be inspired to work hard to achieve more			2
' the children can see that we are struggling on benefits , ' @entity0 says			1
' and that 's not what i want for my children			2
