when it was revealed that the @entity2 and @entity3 had asked for not one but two kitchens to be installed at their @entity6 apartment , questions were asked about why the couple needed so much extra space			1
now those questions have been answered with the news that a second royal baby is on the way , and expected to arrive in march			2
but what will life be like for the new ' spare ' ? with two nurseries and an enviable wardrobe of hand - me - downs from big brother @entity20 to choose from , the new arrival can expect a lavish lifestyle from the moment he or she is born			2
according to @entity39 , @entity38 is the favourite name for a new princess , followed by @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44			1
should the baby turn out to be a boy , @entity45 say @entity48 is the top choice , followed by @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			2
speaking about the news , @entity54 of @entity45 , which suspended betting on a royal baby announcement back in july , added : ' money talks , and we were right to suspend betting in july			0
' the @entity20 betting frenzy is back in full swing , and with one correct gamble already in the bag , punters are quickly reinvesting their winnings on the couple having a second son called @entity48			0
' royal pedigree : @entity43 and @entity53 are among popular choices for the name of the second royal baby the nursery the new royal baby will take its place in the royal nursery alongside @entity20 and will have two to choose from : at @entity6 and at the couple 's country retreat , @entity77 in @entity78			1
currently decorated with characters from the @entity81 books , the @entity3 chose fittings from luxury children 's furniture emporium , @entity85 of @entity86 , where moses baskets start at £ 75			2
overseeing the nursery and both of its royal occupants will be @entity92 - trained nanny , @entity91 , who accompanied the one - year - old prince on his first royal tour to @entity95 and @entity96			0
new home : along with @entity20 and his or her parents , the baby will live at @entity77 in @entity78 in charge : norland - trained nanny @entity102 will also be in charge of the new royal arrival the relatives as with @entity20 , the @entity106 are likely to play a big part in the new arrival 's life with @entity110 and @entity111 expected to take a particularly active role			1
indeed , so close is the @entity3 to her mother , she and baby @entity20 decamped to their @entity116 home within a day of his birth			2
since then , @entity110 in particular has been a constant presence in his life , even helping to plan his @entity121 themed first birthday party			0
but the new baby 's other set of grandparents will also have a prominent role , with prince @entity51 and the @entity127 known to dote on their grandson			0
the @entity130 and the @entity2 will also spend plenty of time with the new arrival as , of course , will prince @entity134 and the baby 's @entity136 aunt and uncle , @entity111 and @entity48			0
grandparents : the @entity106 are close to @entity20 and will spend plenty of time with the new baby royal relations : prince @entity51 and the @entity127 are said to dote on their grandson , @entity20 the wardrobe although just a year old , @entity20 has long made headlines for his wardrobe - and his ability to sell out everything that he wears			2
the new royal arrival will be no exception and like his or her big brother , will boast a wardrobe packed with gorgeous designer buys as well as one or two thrifty purchases			0
when @entity20 made his first appearance outside the @entity161 , it was in a white receiving blanket , which will almost certainly be reused for the new arrival			0
costing £ 44.95 and made by @entity166 + @entity167 , a @entity169 label run by an @entity96 , more than 7000 @entity165 swaddling wraps were sold in the first nine days of @entity20 's life , while traffic to the brand 's website shot up by 1,960 per cent			1
other brands to benefit from the @entity20 effect - and are likely to do the same courtesy of the new royal baby - include @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180			1
second outing : the baby is likely to make its debut in a receiving blanket like @entity166 + @entity187 number stylish : @entity20 spends much of his time in outfits by @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity191 the @entity192 close family friends dominated when it came to choosing the seven godparents for @entity20 , although @entity197 and @entity134 's favourite cousin @entity196 also made the cut			1
the @entity200 's second child is likely to have a similar set of godparents with friends such as @entity204 likely to make the cut second time around			1
@entity204 's wife @entity206 is also a potential godparent , as are prince @entity134 and @entity207 , whose company both the @entity2 and @entity3 enjoy			1

also in the running are members of @entity218 's royal dynasties , among them crown prince frederik of denmark who is a distant relative of the @entity2 , and @entity223 's new queen , @entity224			0
future godparents ? the couple are close to @entity204 and @entity227 whose daughter was their bridesmaid royal godparent : distant relation @entity230 and glamorous @entity130 @entity224 are possibilities it 's the question that will keep us on the edge of our seats until march : what will the @entity200 's second child look like ? according to software programmer @entity240 , the new arrival will have wispy blonde hair , deep brown eyes and a small nose			1
the software expert , who repeated the trick two years ago when the imminent arrival of @entity20 was announced , has so far proved a dab hand at predicting the looks of royal offspring			0
his morph thing application merges photos of the parents and produces an image of what the new child will look like between the ages of two and four			0
