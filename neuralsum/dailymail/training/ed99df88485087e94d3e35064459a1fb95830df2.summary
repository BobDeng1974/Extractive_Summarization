a man in @entity9 has been recorded falling off of his bike after trying to cycle through a muddy puddle the cyclist is trying to cut around a queue of cars when he gets his front wheel stuck in a hole a cyclist then appears riding up the inside of the traffic , no doubt hoping to skip the delay to his morning commute			1
however his ambitions are stopped in their tracks after he drives his front wheel into a pothole hidden by rainwater			2
the hidden hole is deep enough to stop his front wheel in its tracks , sending him flying over the handlebars and face down into the puddle of muddy water			1
despite the painful - looking accident , the man is quickly back on his feet and shrugs at the bus driver as the traffic begins moving again			0
