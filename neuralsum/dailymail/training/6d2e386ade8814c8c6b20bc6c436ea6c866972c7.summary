pictured is @entity1 - the last remaining passenger pigeon - who died in 1914 , marking the rapid extinction of a bird species due to human activity in 1866 , a billion - strong flock of passenger pigeons , 300 miles long and one mile wide , darkened the skies of @entity9 for 14 hours as they flew overhead			1
but less 50 years later , these impressive creatures , once abundant in @entity11 , became extinct as a result of cutting down forests and hunting by humans			0
now geneticists in @entity16 are hoping to bring the passenger pigeon back to life using centuries - old dna			1
the company , revive and @entity21 , will use a process known as ‘ de-extinction ’ which , if successful , could also be used to bring back hundreds of other extinct species			1
the process involves using passenger pigeon dna taken from museum specimens			1
scientists can then fill in the blanks with fragments from the band - tailed pigeon			1
this reconstructed genome would be placed into stem cells of a band - tailed pigeon , which would transform into a cell that could become a sperm or an egg			1
the scientists would then inject these so - called germ cells into band - tailed pigeons			1
their hope is that , as those birds mate , their chicks would have some passenger pigeon genes			1
‘ the genomes of the two birds will be compared in close detail , to determine which differences are most crucial , ’ the company said on their website			2
‘ the data and analysis will begin with the process of converting viable band - tailed dna into viable passenger pigeon dna			1
’ the process involves using passenger pigeon dna taken from museum specimens			1
scientists will then fill in the blanks with fragments of @entity54 from the band - tailed @entity63 reconstructed genome would be placed into stem cells of a band - tailed pigeon			1
the scientists would then inject these so - called germ cells into band - tailed pigeons			1
their hope is that , as those birds mate , their chicks would have some passenger pigeon genes a century ago , @entity1 , a red - eyed , grey and brown bird famous as the last surviving passenger pigeon , keeled over , marking an extinction of a species			1
revive and @entity21 will take the long - dead pigeon out of the file cabinets of history as part of their project			0
‘ here was a bird like the robin that everybody knew and within a generation or two it was gone - and we were its cause , ’ @entity82 ecologist @entity81 said			2
in the 18th and 19th centuries the passenger pigeon was the most abundant bird species on @entity91			1
unlike the domesticated carrier pigeon used for messages , these were wild birds			2
they were easy to catch because they stayed together			0
but they were considered a poor man 's food ; domestic workers complained about eating too much passenger pigeon			2

unlike the domesticated carrier pigeon used for messages , these were wild birds			0
they were easy to catch because they stayed together @entity107 ( pictured ) could help bring extinct @entity108 back to life , according to scientists ‘ nobody ever dreamed that a bird that common could be brought into extinction that quickly , ’ said @entity112 evolutionary biologist @entity111			1
examination of the passenger pigeon 's genetic code shows that their population grew and fell regularly from as much as five billion to as few as tens of millions			2
the chief causes of the extinction - cutting down eastern @entity123 forests and hunting - were man - made , professor @entity111 added			0
by 1900 , there were no passenger pigeons left in the wild			1
by 1914 , there was just one - 29 - year - old @entity1 at the @entity130			0
then on september 1 , 1914 , @entity1 was found lying on the bottom of her cage			0
the passenger pigeon was now extinct			1
pictured are stem cells made from the cell nucleas			2
these will be a crucial part of the ' de-extinction ' process it was the first public extinction , something people used to think happened only to relics of the past like dinosaurs , or critters stuck on islands like dodos , @entity81 and other scientists said			0
bringing the passenger pigeon back would cost millions and take at least a decade , said @entity151 who is leading the project			2
some scientists , however , do n’t believe the idea is ethical or practical			0
but professor @entity151 sees a world on the verge of a mass extinction of many species and feels something has to be done about it			0
reviving some long - lost species , he said , may offer ‘ a type of justice for what we 're doing now and also teach people it 's so much easier to keep something alive than to bring it back to life			2
’ on september 1 , 1914 , @entity1 - the last remaining passenger pigeon - ( pictured ) was found lying on the bottom of her cage by 1900 , there we no passenger pigeons left in the wild			1
by 1914 , there was just 29 - year - old @entity1 at the @entity130			0
people lined up to see her			0
then on september 1 , 1914 , @entity1 was found lying on the bottom of her cage meaning the passenger pigeon had become extinct			2
it had gone from billions of birds to zero in around a century			0
it was the first public extinction , something people used to think happened only to relics of the past like dinosaurs , or animals stuck on islands like dodos			0
@entity1 , the last of her kind , was put in a 300 - pound block of ice and shipped to @entity194 and the @entity195			0
she was stuffed and mounted			0
when she travelled back to @entity196 or to @entity197 for a big conservation conference , she flew in a first class seat			0
for the last 15 years , she has been in a metal filing cabinet in the bowels of the @entity195 , stuck on the same stick with an older stuffed unrelated pigeon named @entity204			0
on monday , they were separated , @entity204 was put back in storage and @entity1 was ready for a comeback			0
an exhibit on her extinction and the 100th anniversary starts june 24 at the @entity195 .			0
