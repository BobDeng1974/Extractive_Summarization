' @entity6 was charged yesterday with 17 counts of premeditated murder , a capital offense that could lead to the death penalty in the massacre of @entity11 civilians , the @entity49 military said			1

@entity6 , a married father of two , was on his fourth tour of duty in @entity68 and had been injured his lawyers say			1
the charge of premeditated murder means prosecutors believe the massacre was pre planned it was the worst allegation of civilian killings by an @entity49 and has severely strained @entity49 - @entity11 ties at a critical time in the decade - old war			1
it 's unclear what prompted the killings , but the case has drawn new attention to the debate over mental health care for the troops , who have experienced record suicide rates and high incidences of post-traumatic stress and brain injuries during repeated deployments in @entity68 and @entity11			1
six other @entity11 - a man , a woman and four children - were wounded in @entity97 district of @entity99 province , the spiritual birthplace of the @entity101			1

@entity6 was on his fourth tour of duty , having served three tours in @entity68 , where he suffered head and foot injuries			1
the decision to charge him with premeditated murder suggests that prosecutors plan to argue that he consciously conceived the killings			0
a military legal official for @entity49 forces in @entity11 who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the case , noted that premeditated murder is not something that has to have been contemplated for a long time			1
the maximum punishment for a premeditated murder conviction is death , dishonorable discharge from the armed forces , reduction to the lowest enlisted grade and total forfeiture of pay and allowances , @entity107 said			0

if the gunman acted alone , information from the @entity11 guards would suggest that he returned to base in between the shooting sprees			2
it also is not known whether the suspect used grenades , @entity107 said			0
the grenade launcher attachment is added to the standard issue m - 4 rifle for some soldiers but not all , he said			0
@entity6 was assigned to provide force protection at the base			2
the pre-dawn shooting spree has further frayed ties between @entity49 troops and president @entity226 as the two nations are negotiating agreements for @entity49 's military footprint in @entity11 after most international combat forces withdraw by the end of 2014			2
after the shootings , @entity226 reiterated his demand that foreign troops leave posts near @entity11 villages and pull back to larger bases			2

@entity272 said @entity6 had earlier suffered a ' serious ' concussion that was not treated ' for a variety of reasons , ' which @entity272 did not explain			2
@entity272 said he thinks the @entity49 government will have difficulty proving its case against @entity6 because ' there is no crime scene ' and a lack of important physical evidence like fingerprints			2
@entity6 ' wife 's attorney said that the family has set up a defense fund called the staff sergeant @entity294 to help pay legal fees			1
