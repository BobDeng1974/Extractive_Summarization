after being buried beneath the sand dunes of @entity2 , @entity3 , the monumental plaster sphinx from the movie @entity0 has been unearthed			1
those who wish to see the piece of movie history will be able to do so next year once it 's been reconstructed , said the executive director of the @entity11 , @entity12			1
the weather - worn 15 - foot - tall @entity13 no longer looks like it did when it was one of the 21 structures lining the path to @entity20 ’s city in the silent classic directed by @entity22 , reports live science			1
' so anything that they wanted to look large , they had to build large			0
' ' it 's giant , ' @entity12 said of @entity20 ’s city which stood 12 stories tall and about 720 feet across			1
today what would be computer animated was built by hand in @entity46 and then transported 156 miles @entity2 where the film crew constructed the massive hollow statues			1
the @entity13 are practically in the same spot they were during filming , said @entity12			0
the urban legend is that when the movie shoot was over the crew dynamited the set and buried the sphinxes in a trench			2
@entity12 saw very little evidence of that			0
more likely , the sandy and windy climate buried the plaster beneath the sand			2
the film helped to guide an excavation of the buried movie treasure in 2012			1
' we 'd work during the day , and we 'd watch the movie at night to figure out what we were finding , ' said @entity69 , a historical archaeology program manager and senior historical archaeologist with @entity72 in @entity3			2
the site has been excavated numerous times			1
the first unearthing occurred in 1990 when the @entity11 had archaeologists dig around in the location of the movie site			1
former glory : pictured here beside an actor in the movie classic @entity0 are the majestic sphinxes as they stood in 1923 they found tobacco tins and bottles with cough syrup that probably replaced alcohol during the prohibition era from 1920 - 1933			1
' what objects like that tell us is that there was n't a whole lot to do at the making of this movie , ' he said			2
' these guys had a lot of really good times before takes			0
' it was n't until 2012 that the @entity11 called upon archaeologists to dig up the site again to search for bigger structures			0
this time they were able to find the head of the sphinx that was ' about the size of a pool table			1
' the head is now on display at the @entity11 but at the time they did n't have the resources to dig for the rest of the body			1
now in 2014 @entity72 has become dedicated to uncovering the rest of the @entity13 before it disappears forever due to erosion			0
' the site is basically being destroyed through erosion , ' @entity69 said			0
' it 's become more critical to try to salvage some materials before they disappear			0
' movie star : the sphinx in the film stand the test of time and will be restored to look like it did in the film the once hollow structure has been filed with sand and the material has become flimsier due to the moist air			1
archaeologist @entity133 and his team at @entity72 carefully excavated the sphinx 's body on october 6			2
to keep the plaster of @entity140 material from cracking , they soaked the structure in cheesecloth soaked with a preservation chemical			0
the team had to work against the weather and could only excavate for a couple hours a day due to the strong winds and the fog			0
eight days later the body was fully excavated and they moved it to a remote location so they could dry it and shrink it to its original size			0
the @entity153 film was one of the first to employ special effects such as @entity156 and @entity157 to show the parting of the red seas			1
huge at the time , the film had a $ 1 million budget			2
' i think it 's a great piece of @entity164 , ' @entity12 said			0
' but you have to hunker down to watch the whole thing , because it 's more than three hours long and it 's silent			0
' those who wish to see the sphinx can do so in 2015 .			0

the monumental plaster sphinx from the 1923 movie @entity0 has been unearthed and will be on display next year
the 1923 film was one of biggest sets ever constructed because at the time there were very little special effects
@entity20 ’s city in the film stood 12 stories tall and about 720 feet across
also excavated at the site of the film were cough syrup bottles to replace alcohol since the film was made during the prohibition
