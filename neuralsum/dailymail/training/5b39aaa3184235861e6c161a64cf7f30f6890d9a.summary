by @entity0 published : 15:46 est , 13 november 2012 updated : 02:52 est , 14 november 2012 with her designer dresses and high heels , she looks every inch the accomplished socialite			2
but @entity6 can reveal that @entity7 was taunted over her large nose in high school - and vowed to get plastic surgery to make it look better – and perhaps the episode points to an inner frailty about her looks that drove her determination to have a string of powerful men in her thrall			1
the woman who is at the center of the scandal that has felled two top generals told fellow pupils when she and her twin sister @entity25 were 18 , that they were ‘ going to get a nose job and when we you do you ’ll all be in awe of us ’			2
then and now : in her teens , @entity7 allegedly was defensive of her nose saying she would get plastic surgery she was also ‘ flirtatious ’ , gave boys she met a big grin and used to wear tight blue jeans which brought many an admiring male gaze			1
it is not clear if mrs @entity7 followed through on her promise to get plastic surgery			1
the claims show that mrs @entity7 ’s interest in carefully crafting her image started at an early age			1
since the scandal broke she has appeared in public ‘ looking a million dollars ’ , notably in a bright yellow dress and three inch heels as she climbed into her mercedes outside her mansion in @entity49 , @entity50 yesterday and today in a polished pink and gold heels ensemble			1
judging by pictures in her high school yearbook , she was glamorous and well aware of her charms even at a young age			1
in her official 1993 graduation photo for @entity58 in @entity59 , @entity60 she posed wearing a black dress and pearls around her neck with her jet black hair tumbling over her left shoulder			0
close ties : @entity7 ( right ) exchanged emails and ims with @entity69 daily but those were on his official account and were monitored by staff members her body is turned to the left and has a radiant grin on her face mrs @entity7 , 37 , has become the central figure in the scandal which has caused general @entity69 , 60 , to step down as head of the @entity79 and forced general @entity80 to stand down from his post leading @entity83 troops in @entity84			1
general @entity80 , who is married , sent her between 20,000 to 30,000 e-mail messages , some of which were of an inappropriate nature			1
@entity69 ’ mistress , @entity90 , an @entity91 reservist who was also his biographer , is said to have emailed mrs @entity7 and warned her to back off because she was jealous , which led to the affair becoming public when the @entity94 got involved			1
mrs @entity7 ’s former high school friend told @entity6 that in her youth she was ‘ studious ’ and would help others out with their maths studies if they asked her			1
the friend said : ‘ she and her sister were joined at the hip , we hardly ever saw them apart so we called them ‘ @entity102 ’			2

pictured with @entity7 is her husband , @entity107 , and @entity108 ‘ they joined in year 11 so there was just one year before we went to college , and they did n’t have much time to make lots of friends			1
i ’m not sure they even went to the prom and i do n’t think they went to any of the parties that happened			0
‘ i ’m stunned they are involved in all this			0
i guess some people get their partying out of the way when they are younger - they were pretty quiet at school so i guess it ’s all coming out now ’			2
the friend added that both mrs @entity7 and her sister ‘ used to get teased about their noses ’			2
the friend said : ‘ people used to say things			0
it did come out and it was quite pronounced and thick			0
‘ i remember her making a comment , it was something like : ‘ we are going to get a nose job and when we you do you ’ll all be in awe of us			0
i was like : ‘ @entity149 , ok ’			0
she did n’t touch you or anything but she would look you in the eye and smile			0
‘ she would wear shorts in the summer and she and her sister would wear matching jeans that were usually pretty tight			0
‘ she did n’t date anyone to my knowledge while she was at @entity160			0
@entity6 can also reveal that mrs @entity7 might have had access to ‘ influential figures in the global area ’ even before she left high school			1

according to the @entity184 branch of the nationwide non-profit organisation , it was founded in 1949 to inform people of all ages ‘ on matters of national and international significance ’			0
among the guest speakers in the past have been @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197			0
its website says : ‘ @entity200 provides its members and the greater @entity184 community with access to influential figures in the global area as well as opportunities to visit fascinating destinations through its unique travel program			0
’ @entity69 also made an appearance , but it was in 2010 and long after she had left school			1

the newspaper also started up a world news section because , according to its 1993 editor @entity237 , there was concern students were ‘ lacking in their knowledge of the outside world ’			0
another string to mrs @entity7 ’s bow was the @entity244 whose members took part in competitions where they learned skills that would be useful at work , such as typing and accounting			2
in the yearbook @entity251 said : ‘ i believe that @entity244 not only exposes students to the important field of business , but it also aides the community			0
‘ students are able to get a taste of the real world in more ways than one ’ mrs @entity7 also appears to have had a strong moral compass and was a member of @entity263 - another group called students for a @entity266 , the student council , a community outreach program called @entity268 and the @entity269 her other activities were computer club , science club , orchestra basketball , cross country running , field hockey , softball , swimming , tennis , track and field and orchestra			2

' very sexy ' : @entity7 has been accused of sending ' flirtatious ' messages to another general , @entity80 public eye : @entity7 , who received threatening emails from @entity90 , watches coverage of the scandal standing out : @entity7 , who kicked off an @entity94 probe into general @entity69 , looks outside her @entity49 home as coverage of his affair with @entity90 plays on television in the background affair : @entity69 is pictured with @entity90 , his biographer and alleged mistress her parents , @entity300 and @entity301 , once ran a @entity303 restaurant and now live in @entity304 , @entity60			1
in her yearbook entry , mrs @entity7 ’s twin sister @entity305 wears the same clothes as her sister and is also smiling			1
her activities included concert choir , the @entity175 and @entity311			2
the sisters moved to @entity49 , @entity50 around ten years ago where they both became regulars on the social circuit			2
mrs @entity7 ’s husband @entity107 works as a surgeon , while @entity110 is a lawyer who specialises in dealing with whistleblowers , which has newfound irony considering @entity150 was the one whose contact with the @entity94 led to the resignation of a well - respected general and the investigation into another			1
a friend , who has known @entity7 for almost a decade , said that the revelation that mrs @entity7 exchanged between 20,000 and 30,000 pages of communications with general @entity80 comes as a surprise			1
scandal : @entity7 stands out in a canary yellow dress as she leaves her @entity49 home on monday family : @entity80 is pictured with his wife @entity334 ( left ) and daughter @entity334 ( right ) at a hearing examining the situation in @entity84 in @entity338 in march ' this has come as a complete shock			1
you never know what goes on behind closed doors , but no one in her circle saw this coming , ' the friend told @entity6			0
' @entity150 was well known for throwing parties where the military attended and she reveled in her role as honorary ambassador but sending all those emails to a general is another thing			2
' her brother , @entity356 , has also revealed their fear that she will be branded the ' other woman '			0

' my sister , number one , is a mother			0
she has three kids and is extremely dedicated to those kids			0
' number two she is a wife			0
she is extremely dedicated to her husband and he to her			0
for her to have an affair with @entity69 is ludicrous			2
mrs @entity7 regularly kept in touch with then - @entity69 when he became commander of the @entity84 war effort , the two exchanging near - daily emails and instant messages , two of his former staffers say			1
but those messages were exchanged in accounts that his aides monitored as part of their duties and were not romantic in tone , the staffers said			0
mr @entity356 added that he expected his sister , who has hired the crisis management firm employed by @entity393 and the attorney who represented @entity395 earlier this year , to address reports about her involvement with two of the top @entity83 military chiefs			0
