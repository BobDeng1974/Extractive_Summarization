by @entity0 published : 02:40 est , 12 december 2013 updated : 03:29 est , 12 december 2013 @entity1 : once reliant on @entity4 buildings , prison governors now have phones in every cell prisoners in newly - built jails will have phones and computer terminals in their cells so they are able to contact relatives , arrange activities and order meals			1
the feature will be rolled out in the newest prisons in the @entity17 in order to improve the quality of prisoner accommodation			0
according to a report by the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) published today , in - cell phones and computer terminals have already been installed in @entity25			1
the report recommended new prisons contain ‘ terminals to book activities and order meals ’			2
it added : ‘ in - cell telephones , as well as allowing prisoners to maintain family contact ( important for successful rehabilitation ) , also contribute to prisoner safety , ’ the report said			1
the phones will be used in new prisons throughout @entity37 and @entity38 , where more than 2,500 prisoners are housed			2
the government ’s spending watchdog said the facilities built by @entity43 provide ‘ a good standard of accommodation for prisoners			2
’ the report said that the new forms of communication had been welcomed by prisoners in focus groups			2
‘ prisoners generally recognised the improvement in accommodation , as has the independent inspectorate , ' it added			0
more than 90 per cent of cells have built - in showers and in all new buildings have attached toilets			0
the report , which looked at value for money across the prison system , said the measures were introduced because they saved funds			0
ease : there is no more queueing for precious moments on the phone in several prisons , where talking to relatives from their cells helps prisoners integrate into the wider world , the report said ( file photo ) cell : having more facilities inside cells saved time and money unlocking them , said the @entity22 ( file photo ) removing the need to unlock prisoners to wash helps to reduce staff costs , while in - cell telephones reduce the need to set up queues for communal phones or watch prisoners out of their cells			1
elsewhere the report said more foreign prisoners should be removed from the country after the number of deportations fell by 14 per cent since 2009			1
it added : ' removing more prisoners would allow the @entity97 to reduce prison capacity			0
this could happen if the @entity100 prioritised cases better , improved case administration and used the foreign national offender - only prisons , that the @entity97 has created , more effectively			0
' meanwhile only 14 per cent of prisoners in new capacity now share cells - but some are in overcrowded conditions , the report said , adding it was ' against @entity111 and @entity113 guidelines '			1
the report claimed changes to the prison system have saved £ 71 million since 2010 .			0

@entity22 claimed the facilities make prisons more efficient
only 12 per cent still share cells , which is against *international* guidelines
report added more foreign prisoners should be deported after number fell
