@entity0 wants @entity1 to join the @entity2 , despite his drive to reduce net migration to tens of thousands			1
the prime minister said yesterday that it remained a ' long - standing goal ' for @entity8 that the nation of 75million people should join the @entity2 , and that the issue was under active discussion			1
speaking in the @entity1 capital @entity14 after talks with prime minister @entity16 , he said of @entity1 's membership : ' i very much support that … we discussed that last night			1
mr @entity0 last visited @entity1 four years ago , and said at the time that he was there to ' make the case for @entity1 's @entity2 membership ' and was its ' strongest advocate '			1
however since then , he has committed to an in - out referendum on @entity8 's membership of the @entity2 amid rising public concern about levels of immigration			1
his ministers have also been forced to admit the government will fail in its target to reduce net migration to ' tens of thousands '			0
the latest figures last month revealed it had risen to 260,000			0
but yesterday he said his position has not changed			0
talks about @entity1 accession have stalled in recent years with @entity51 deeply opposed to its membership			2
there are also fears millions of people could migrate to other @entity56 countries and that the @entity1 government has been sliding back on human rights commitments			2
meetings : mr @entity0 also met with the @entity1 president @entity60 ( right ) mr @entity0 said : ' in terms of @entity1 membership of the @entity2 , i very much support that			1
that 's a longstanding position of @entity8 foreign policy which i support			2
we discussed that again in our talks today '			0
it is understood any moves towards @entity1 membership of the @entity2 would take several years , and would almost certainly involve transitional controls on new migrants			2
but his words will provoke a reaction @entity75			0
leader @entity77 said last year : ' the vast majority of people in northern @entity56 would not support enlargement to include a country like @entity1 '			2
mr @entity0 's visit was to discuss the issue of @entity8 foreign fighters travelling to @entity85 and northern @entity86 to join @entity87			1
at least 500 @entity8 jihadis are believed to have joined the @entity90 fanatics , many of them travelling on commercial flights to @entity1 and infiltrating its porous border with @entity85			1
mr @entity0 said the two countries would share intelligence and work ' hand in glove ' to ' stop this scourge of foreign fighters and defeat this ideology of violence '			2
in addition to passing counter-terror laws and drawing up plans to seize the passports of suspected jihadis , the prime minister said those who travel through @entity1 and other routes ' threaten us back at home so we should do everything that we can and we 've had very productive discussions '			1
but mr @entity16 seemed to deny jihadists travelling through @entity1 were due to lax controls			0
he said in a press conference at his ministry : ' we have a very clear and obvious position			0
foreign fighters are a threat to the countries that they are coming from or for the neighbouring countries			0
@entity1 has never tolerated their transit through our territory or their existence in @entity85			1
' these fighters are creating a threat for us in @entity1 , they are casting a shadow over the just cause of the @entity85 people …			1
no country can claim that it is under more of a threat than @entity1 [ from terrorism ]			0
he even blamed ' propaganda in the foreign press ' for claiming @entity141 leaders had passed through @entity1			0
he said : ' @entity141 actually emerged in @entity86 and when @entity86 was under @entity143 control they developed with the support of the @entity85 regime			0
in no way did any @entity141 leader pass through the @entity1 border			0

@entity0 made remarks on visit to @entity1 capital @entity14
they are likely to provoke anger from @entity157 backbenchers
visit was to discuss young @entity8 jihadis flying to @entity85 via @entity1
