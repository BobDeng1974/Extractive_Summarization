@entity0 was fighting for his job from day one			1
supporters frustrated with a season of turmoil on and off the pitch were vocal in criticising the appointment of a man sacked from his two previous stints as manager , at @entity10 and @entity11			2
@entity13 , renowned as an excellent football coach , will be bitterly disappointed he failed to last longer than 22 games in charge of @entity16			1
but a record of five wins and 11 losses was viewed as unpalatable by chairman @entity20 , whose instinct to pull the trigger decisively sees him about to embark on a fourth head coach in little more than a year			2
@entity0 ca n't hide his anguish after his side fell to another defeat at @entity28 at the weekend @entity29 was sacked on december 14 , 2013 , while @entity30 left the @entity31 in may after @entity16 finished one place above the relegation zone			1
stability seems a distant planet for this club right now			2
the revolving door is not just used by the employee charged with training the squad and picking the team – for that is the role of head coach in @entity16 ’s continental structure			1
@entity45 ( centre ) said that @entity0 always had the backing of the @entity16 players forward @entity49 scores the opening goal of @entity28 's win against @entity16 the head - spinning extends to those on the pitch			1
a summer flurry like no other saw 10 players leave and 11 join			2
at times signings appeared slapdash			2
a significant number have failed to impress			2
chief among them is record purchase @entity62 , who cost £ 10million but has scored only twice in all competitions and looked off the pace			0
@entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 have all made little impression , with the jury still out on @entity72 and @entity73			0
club record signing @entity62 ( centre ) has been a major disappointment since joining in the summer @entity0 had a hand in all these moves to varying degrees but is not intimately involved on the recruitment side			1
recently he admitted to not stepping foot in the recruitment room since the summer			0
the system @entity16 use on that front needs scrutiny			1
technical director @entity85 was appointed from @entity86 last summer tasked with bringing in a new head coach and overseeing transfers			0
but his previous role was not dedicated to that and he started at @entity16 playing catch - up			1
that left the club behind others and they are paying the price now			0
technical director @entity85 ( left ) at @entity13 's unveiling was brought in from @entity86 last summer sporting director @entity97 sorts contracts and finances			0
everyone is answerable to @entity101			0
@entity0 was popular with players who respected his training methods – described as varied and interesting			1
but perhaps , to his cost , he was too nice – unable to provoke performances on matchdays			0
even though @entity13 would work his fingers to the bone – in contrast to @entity30 , for example – this eventuality was all too predictable			0
peace grew increasingly concerned as results tailed off , with the current run at seven defeats in nine matches			0
@entity0 could have been sent packing before the @entity118 match but got a win courtesy of @entity121 ’s late strike			1
@entity0 acknowledges the crowd at his home debut back in august at the start of the season at @entity13 ’s peak during the 4 - 0 win over @entity129 supporters chanted his name , but it was all too fleeting			1
the viciousness of the abuse aimed his way after the 2 - 0 defeat at @entity28 on sunday was impossible to ride out , @entity20 determined			1
peace must make his next appointment work			0
the turbulent nature of the @entity31 dugout needs to cease			1
@entity140 , who came very close to getting the job after @entity30 , is the frontrunner			0
talks collapsed last summer over his wage demands and his desire to bring in staff of @entity146 and @entity147			0
those hurdles could be overcome this time			0
former @entity149 manager @entity140 is the favourite to replace @entity0 at the @entity31 @entity140 would work within @entity16 ’s structure but provide a more outspoken voice to @entity13			1
it would be interesting to see how he functions in the role			0
@entity155 is another option and a surer bet in the @entity158			2
although whether the former @entity28 and @entity160 manager would agree to @entity16 ’s model remains to be seen			1
assistant head coaches @entity162 and @entity164 will take charge for the @entity167 clash at @entity168 but their long term futures remain uncertain			2
former @entity160 manager @entity155 is looking for a new club and could head to the @entity31 @entity171 on monday night @entity16 released a statement			1
tellingly , a replacement is expected by the weekend			0
@entity0 was praised by the club for his work to bring on @entity176 and @entity177 the imperative of staying in the top division was underlined too			2
whoever comes next will understand that necessity .			0

@entity16 have only won once in their last nine @entity158 games
@entity0 was *subjected* to barrage of abuse after 2 - 0 defeat by @entity28
@entity0 only lasted 22 games in charge at the @entity31
