middle - aged : it 's been said that life begins at 40 , but it might be more accurate to say that mid-life begins at 40 according to a @entity4 poll it ’s been said , somewhat optimistically , that life begins at 40			1
now it seems a more accurate adage might read : mid-life begins at 40			2
or to be precise , according to a study which reveals general attitudes to youth and ageing , the age at which we should stop calling ourselves young is 40 years , eight months and two weeks			1
and , rather worryingly , the @entity15 surveyed reckon old age begins when people reach the age of 59 years , two months and two weeks			1
the poll , for the @entity20 , spoke to 2,171 people aged 16 or over and uncovered stark variations in the views of men and women and different age groups			1
men say being young stops at 38 and a half			0
for women the cut - off is delayed until 42 years , nine months and three months			2
old age , according to women , begins at 60 years , four months and two @entity34 for men , it is much earlier – at 58			1
the gap may be down to men placing more emphasis on diminishing strength as a mark of ageing , or because women tend to live longer			0
as you might expect , the definition of old age goes back in later life			0
under - 50s said it begins at 46 years and nine months			2
for those age 50 - plus , old age starts at 62 years , seven months and two weeks			1
while 16 - to 24 - year - olds said being young ends at 32 , for those aged 80 - plus the answer was 52			0
this is not far short of when the youngest group said old age begins – 54			1
the @entity20 said ‘ the disparity in perceptions ’ showed ‘ the potential for age stereotypes to be applied in very inconsistent ways ’			2
old age : @entity15 believe that old age begins at the age of 59 years , two months and two weeks according to a @entity4 poll ( file picture ) class and income may also be factors			1
the unemployed said being young ends nine years earlier than those with full time jobs			0
people who lived in council houses tended to believe old age started five years earlier than those who owned their home outright			2
@entity70 of over- 50s group @entity69 said : ‘ these surveys show that the older you get , the later you think old age begins			1
‘ what is happening is that people are suddenly getting to an age and thinking : no , i ’m not old actually			0
i might have thought i would feel old at this age , but i do not			0
‘ this survey also shows there is significant age discrimination and outdated attitudes among younger people – and that is worrying			0
‘ youngsters tend to think people who are older are not up to much			0
it ’s just not true			0

@entity15 believe that old age begins at 59 years , two months and two weeks
