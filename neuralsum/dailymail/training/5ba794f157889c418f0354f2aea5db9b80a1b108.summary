@entity0 is concerned that @entity1 are exerting ‘ pressure ’ on their @entity3 players around @entity5 games and feels a ‘ clear the air ’ summit with manager @entity8 is required			1
the @entity3 no 2 acknowledges @entity8 has a duty to his club but feels ‘ balance ’ is needed regarding the international availability of @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 for the remainder of the @entity20 campaign			1
@entity15 has missed the last three @entity20 qualifiers , including friday ’s 1 - 0 loss to @entity23 , but is expected to be fit for @entity1 ’s game against @entity25 on saturday			1
‘ i worry that he ( @entity15 ) is under lots of pressure , particularly from @entity1 ’s point of view , ’ said @entity0 on sunday			1
‘ because every time there is an international match it does seem to be @entity16 ( @entity45 ) and @entity46 ( @entity15 ) under lots of pressure			2
they ’re turning up or they might n’t turn up , or they ’re struggling , ’ he observed			0
‘ you always get the impression from @entity1 that @entity16 and @entity46 are both barely able to walk , that type of thing			0
@entity15 is set to return to action for @entity1 against @entity25 on saturday despite his latest injury @entity0 was speaking at a press conference ahead of his team 's match against @entity27 on tuesday ‘ so when they actually turn up and they are walking through the reception , “ @entity61 , it ’s a miracle			1
” with @entity5 ’s @entity67 fate hinging on strong home form in the six qualifiers to come in 2015 , @entity0 feels the point should be made to @entity8 , in person , how important his players are to their country			1
‘ there has to be , i think , some sort of sit - down conversation and say , “ listen , i think @entity77 ’s been more than good enough here , particularly the friendlies but these are big qualifying matches now , ” said @entity0			0
‘ @entity8 has to look after his club and he is probably thinking they have @entity83 games			0
@entity16 ( right ) missed @entity85 's match against @entity37 last month , but was deemed fit for @entity1 ‘ @entity8 , i do n’t think , has ever played senior level at international level and maybe he does n’t appreciate how big it is for us and how big the games are for us , ’ he added			1
@entity0 can still see where @entity8 is coming from , just as @entity91 was often unenthusiastic about @entity0 playing for @entity5 , especially friendlies			1
‘ we talk about the manager here and the manager there but there ’s a player in between all that , and i can speak from experience , he ’s under lots of pressure too , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ there is a guarantee that when the player turns up ( for internationals ) they are getting phone calls left , right and centre from their 15 physios at the club			0
’ ‘ you ’re also hoping the player can make the decision and say , ‘ i ’ll give it a go ’ or whatever it might be , ’ he said			0
@entity15 missed the @entity23 game despite an all - clear scan on his hamstring , which prompted speculation that his heart was n’t up for a @entity121 return			2
@entity0 claims he is hoping to hold ' clear the air ' talks with @entity1 manager @entity8 @entity0 appreciates the fact that @entity1 boss @entity8 ' has to look after his club ' @entity17 ( left ) sustained serious knee damage on @entity3 duty 13 months ago ‘ some times it may be up to the player to say , “ listen , i ’m going to try and train , whatever my club manager says or whatever the doctor says or whatever the scan says ” because you do know your own body , ’ observed @entity0			1
‘ whatever way you look at it , @entity46 did n’t train all week – it ’s not as if he went out and had a jog , it ’s not as if he ’s joined in a little bit of possession			0
so that was a difficult one			0
’ asked if @entity15 was afraid of being jeered in his native @entity121 , @entity0 said : ‘ nah , i do n’t think so			2
’ ‘ they ( @entity15 and @entity150 ) declared for @entity5 , they are @entity3 and are proud to be involved with us			1
i do n’t think that ( jeering ) was an issue			0
’ if @entity8 is protective of his players , he may have fair reason after @entity17 sustained serious knee damage on @entity3 duty 13 months ago , which kept him out for almost a year			2
@entity1 winger @entity150 was born and raised in @entity23 , but chose to play for @entity5 @entity15 ( centre ) was born and raised in @entity23 but chose to play for the @entity5			2

@entity0 claims @entity1 are putting pressure on their @entity3 players
@entity0 *frustrated* by international availability of @entity161
@entity15 has missed last three @entity20 qualifiers
@entity5 no 2 appreciates @entity8 must look after his club
