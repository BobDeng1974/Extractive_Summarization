however @entity19 and @entity20 's parents , the grandparents as @entity21 knew them , fought just as hard to keep her			1
following a bitter three - year battle both in and out of court , a judge ruled the girls would stay with the families who had raised until they were old enough to make their own decisions			1

@entity14 is one of the two girls at the center of the most *notorious* switched at birth case , which *gripped* @entity6 when discovered in 1998
in july 1995 two baby girls were switched shortly after birth at @entity199 hospital
the parents raising the other baby , named @entity127 , were killed in a car crash the same day @entity199 discovered the swap
young couple @entity19 and @entity20 died not knowing daughter @entity21 was n't theirs biologically and they never met @entity14
now 18 , @entity14 has given her first interview about her life and the gratitude she has for @entity15
@entity15 fought to keep @entity14 and get custody of @entity21 as well
a judge ruled @entity21 would stay with @entity19 and @entity20 's family instead
