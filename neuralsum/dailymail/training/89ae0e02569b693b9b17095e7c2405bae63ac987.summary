by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 somewhere amid what seems like a never - ending cascade of empty promises and psychobabble about ‘ positive signs ’ and a brighter future for @entity10 football , there was this frank assessment of the @entity12 by @entity13			1
‘ it ’s easy for me to stand here and say we ’re young and we can go forward , ’ said the @entity15 midfielder			1
‘ but if you look at a team like @entity22 , they ’ve got young players who are delivering now			1
‘ @entity24 is running out for us to say we ’re young			2
i ’ll be 23 in january and that ’s a good age for a footballer			2
@entity27 and @entity28 are good young players			1
they showed in this tournament what they can do			0
but in the next tournament , we really have to deliver			0
‘ it ’s a nice group of young players and hopefully we can stick together , learn from this , take all this disappointment and bottle it up			1
this is the worst feeling			0
’ @entity61 ’s squad returned home on wednesday having not won in five games since they left for a training camp in @entity65			0
they failed to live up to expectations that were at an all - time low and a summer of soul - searching begins			0
like @entity13 , @entity69 is 22 and another who can no longer hide in the ‘ emerging ’ category			1
of @entity75 ’s outfield players , only @entity72 and @entity73 started more @entity77 games last season			1
natural : @entity13 praised @entity47 , saying his performance against @entity80 made it seem like he had 100 caps for his country out of the frying pan : manager @entity61 faces a long summer of soul - searching after @entity36 's abject performance since leaving for @entity38 there are feelings at @entity90 that a player of terrific potential has not progressed as they hoped			1
not helped by the fact that @entity69 is prone to accidents and unsure of his best position			2
‘ i ’d like to go back to the club and cement a regular place , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’ve said in the past few years that sometimes it does n’t really affect me but it is nice to cement a regular place			0
hopefully i can do that			0
‘ it ’s for the manager to decide the position i play			0
you ’ve seen me play centre back , right back and the holding role in midfield			0
obviously , i think i ’m an out - and - out defender			0
‘ i ’m happy to play anywhere for @entity75			2
that ’s for the manager to decide			0
’ it is a big season for @entity69 under new @entity75 boss @entity114 and important for @entity36 that his manager restores some direction			1
@entity117 , 24 , and @entity118 , 23 , fall into the same bracket			1
@entity36 has bright future - @entity120 solid , if unspectacular : @entity69 hopes his versatility can impress new @entity75 boss @entity114 time to deliver : @entity117 , who played for @entity36 against @entity80 , must perform more consistently for @entity75 next season @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 have supported @entity13 ’s point that players can deliver influential performances at 22			1
@entity132 chief executive @entity131 spoke on wednesday of the need for firmer ‘ home - grown ’ quotas			0
the @entity77 argue that investment must be made by the @entity137 at grassroots level to produce more skilful young players to compete with those from abroad and that if they are good enough they will break into the first teams			1
it is the ideological clash at the heart of the @entity10 game			0
sir @entity145 steps down after more than a decade in charge of development and coaching education , during which time the @entity77 has become stronger and the @entity137 has been bullied in the club - versus - country struggles at all age levels			2
golden boy : @entity153 sensation @entity124 , 22 , has already scored four goals at the finals influential : @entity156 's @entity126 , 22 , has scored three times at the finals so far meanwhile @entity36 ’s tournament results have bombed and the senior team appear unaware what it takes to win a competitive game			1
@entity145 ’s duties will be absorbed into the realm of @entity166 , the @entity137 ’s director of elite development			0
will that reverse the tide ? who knows ? @entity36 , who started the @entity12 somewhat generously ranked 10th , can expect to be overtaken by a pack including @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 and possibly even @entity80			1
rankings will matter next year when they affect the 2018 @entity12 qualifying draw			2
if @entity36 wallow outside @entity182 ’s top 10 they are likely to be thrown into a group with a team such as @entity22 , @entity172 or @entity185			1
so @entity61 needs his young stars to develop			2
his instinct is to shield them but the hype intensifies when a country produces such a small number of players at the required standard			2
when a dozen per year emerge , demanding international recognition , then the hype will be diluted			0
stepping down : sir @entity145 ( left ) is leaving his post as director of football development after 10 years at the helm slipping down : @entity36 , who entered the @entity12 10th in the @entity202 rankings , will be overtaken by a number of teams after the tournament @entity36 need @entity47 , @entity27 , @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity28 to mature and improve , coping with the sort of set - backs which have hit @entity13 and @entity69 since their days as teenage sensations			1
more than that , @entity61 must hope these players are not anomalies but represent the start of a new cycle ; that more high - grade young footballers with an appetite to reach the top are produced by club academies			2
evidence for this is not overwhelming			0
he also needs those such as @entity13 and @entity69 back on track			2
at least they are showing the right attitude			0
soldiering on : @entity13 knows he has a very important season ahead for @entity15 and @entity36 the @entity15 man plans a short holiday before reporting back to his club , in an effort to keep fit			1
‘ i ’ll go back early , ’ said @entity13			0
‘ i ’m not sure i ’ll go away with the team ( to the @entity232 ) but my fitness is on the way up and i do n’t want to lose that			0
it ’s a big season for me , a big season for @entity15			1
’ it ’s a big season for @entity36 , too .			1

as @entity36 return from @entity38 , @entity15 star admits @entity12 *negatives*
says young players are performing already for countries like @entity22
big season awaits @entity69 , @entity117 and @entity118 at @entity75
@entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 already stars at young age
@entity36 need @entity47 , @entity27 , @entity207 , @entity206 and @entity28 to mature during @entity250 campaign
