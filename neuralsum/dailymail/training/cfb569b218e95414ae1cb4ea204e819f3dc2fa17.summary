@entity0 is fighting to stop a tiny hamlet which inspired @entity3 's most famous books from being ' obliterated ' by a housing estate			1
@entity3 wrote @entity5 in his parents ' cottage near @entity8 , @entity9 - which is also where he went to school and saw a milkmaid who inspired @entity13			1
now an agricultural college has lodged plans to build 70 new houses in the tiny settlement , which currently has just 28 homes			1
maddened crowd : villagers ( pictured ) are protesting plans by an agricultural college to more than treble the size of @entity8 , @entity9 , where @entity3 went to school and which inspired his novels picturesque : @entity3 grew up in this thatched cottage a mile from the threatened @entity9 village of @entity8 , and it was here that he wrote his famous novel @entity5 in 1874 @entity32 creator @entity0 ( left ) is leading the fight and said the houses would be like an ' atom bomb '			1
right : @entity36 , who lives in @entity3 's old school , said the proposal is ' bonkers ' @entity32 creator @entity40 , who is the president of the @entity41 and lives a mile away in @entity42 , said the rolling hills immortalised in @entity3 's books would be ruined			1
' the residents of @entity8 are about to be hit with an atom bomb , ' he said			2
' this development will obliterate the village			0
' this is a hamlet of 28 houses which will almost quadruple in size in one go , having been the same size for hundreds of years			1
' five to ten houses could be absorbed by the village but 70 is a sledgehammer blow			2
' people from around the world come to visit to see where @entity3 lived and where he wrote and the places that inspired him			1
one can not understate how much the local area inspired @entity3			2
' pilgrimage : the @entity65 novelist walked every day down this lane from his cottage home to @entity8 , and it inspired the idyllic country atmosphere of the fictionalised county @entity71 in his novels outrage : villagers are campaigning against the development , which would more than treble the hamlet 's size plans : the site of the proposed development and @entity3 's cottage , near the town of @entity82 in @entity9 nestled among history : the planned housing ( in red ) is a stone 's throw from @entity3 's old school ( purple ) @entity91 hills : a satellite image of the same site handed to the council			1
the college is on the far left in yellow he added : ' we have a real responsibility to protect the environment of one of @entity103 's greatest global writers			0
' can you imagine plans to build almost 100 houses at @entity107 ( @entity109 's home ) or @entity110 ( the home of the @entity112 ) ? ' the housing plans - which have also been slammed by @entity114 and the @entity115 - have been put forward by the @entity117 agricultural college , which owns the land			1
the college 's bosses say selling the plot for housing is the only way it can raise enough money to expand and redevelop			0
outline plans are being considered by @entity127 and have attracted more than 50 objections			0
born in nearby @entity8 in 1840 , @entity3 grew up in his parents ' thatched cottage a mile from the village currently under threat			1
lord @entity0 said : ' the residents of @entity8 are about to be hit with an atom bomb ' idyll : the plans for the 28 - home hamlet prompted anger from @entity114 and the @entity115 pretty : @entity3 's @entity71 was shaped by his years spent in the picturesque @entity9 village in the mid- 1880s it was there that he wrote @entity5 , which proved to be his first major literary success when it was published in 1874			1
the cottage is now run by @entity114 , and is far from the only mark @entity3 left on the landscape			2
the beautiful countryside of @entity9 was repeatedly immortalised in his novels as the fictional county of @entity71 , whose idyllic rural perfection became the focus of years of literary criticism			2
he was inspired by regular walks down the tree - lined lane to @entity8 , where he went to school in a building which still exists as a private home - together with the @entity65 school bell			1
@entity8 itself became the fictional village of @entity162 in @entity3 's 1872 novel under the @entity164 , which depicted romantic tanglings in tight - knit village life			1
@entity167 : the protests began on a small scale , but have extended beyond the tiny village published anonymously , it focused on a new schoolmistress named @entity173 who arrives in ' @entity174 ' and attracts a number of suitors to the school house where she lives			2
in 2005 the @entity178 produced an adaptation of the novel starring @entity181			0
it was later in life that @entity3 saw an 18 - year - old milkmaid in @entity8 - and she became the inspiration for the central character of his 1892 masterpiece @entity13			1
neighbouring @entity82 also became the town of the title in @entity3 's 1886 work @entity191			2
along with @entity193 's birthplace - and nearby @entity8 , historians say the three villages act as a ' pilgrimage route ' for fans of the writer			2
@entity3 's heart was removed before he was cremated and buried in @entity8 - while the rest of his ashes were interred in @entity201 in @entity202			1
@entity203 , the chairman of the @entity115 , said : ' @entity3 would turn in his grave at the prospect of this massive development in his native hamlet			1
the peace and quiet of this lovely area would be ruined			0
' this is of course a popular tourist destination because of its association with @entity3 and it would be an outrage if the council were to allow such alien and overpowering development			0
' retired paediatrician dr @entity36 has lived in @entity3 's former school house - just 30 yards from the proposed houses - since 1962			1
he said : ' the peaceful and rural setting of the school house , which so many @entity3 fans pause to look at from the river path that @entity3 used to walk , will be blighted by this			2
' seventy houses is disproportionately large for a hamlet that has only 30 houses			0
this development would overwhelm @entity8			0
' @entity229 , the principal of @entity230 , said : ' we want to provide additional @entity233 agri - tech facilities and expand our higher education offer enabling more students to study degree programmes on their doorstep			0
' the capital released from the sale of land will enable the college to embark on a programme of redevelopment and will have a positive impact on meeting local housing needs			0
' the plans are by the @entity117 agricultural college ( above ) , which is selling the land to raise money the principal of the college ( above ) said it was the only way to ensure it could compete in the modern world born in 1840 , @entity3 is now one of the most celebrated novelists and poets in @entity103 history - not least because of his descriptions of rural @entity9 life			1
he immortalised the county where he grew up as ' @entity71 ' , setting all of his major novels in the somewhat idealised , fictionalised world			0
to him as to many romantic and @entity65 authors , the countryside represented a more pristine life than the grunting machinery which heralded the @entity266 , but also one more closely entwined with mankind 's animalistic desires			0
celebrated : @entity3 created a pastoral picture of the rural @entity103 in which he grew up @entity71 was first used in @entity5 , which told the story of an independent - minded young woman who refuses to marry humble shepherd @entity5			1
the girl , @entity5 , comes into money and moves away - but is forced to seek @entity278 's help when her sheep begin dying			0
a long and complex friendship follows , and slowly @entity281 realises the friendship of her youth - not the temptations of the wider world - is the key to her happiness			0
@entity278 asks her to marry him a second time and she accepts			0
@entity71 was also used in @entity3 's 1892 masterwork @entity13 - whose original subtitle was a @entity291			1
she is the daughter of a poor family which is corrupted at the beginning of the novel by a rumour that she is descended from nobility			0
but when she goes to meet the libertine @entity299 , instead of inheriting his family 's estate she starts working on it - before being raped by @entity299 in a symbolic , and real , loss of innocence			0
as her life unravels it does so in that same country setting , and after she finally stabs @entity299 to death it is to @entity309 that she walks to await her fate			0
@entity71 itself was named after the @entity313 @entity103 kingdom which took in much of the south west , but its borders were not the same and changed from novel to novel			0
in reality it was a poor area which changed little in hundreds of years and was blighted by a devastating death rate in sickness and childbirth ' @entity3 turned away from novels in the 1890s after @entity13 and @entity325 received mixed reviews , and began writing poetry instead			2
he died in 1928 and his ashes were interred in @entity201 at @entity202 .			0

agricultural college lodged plans for 70 new houses in 28 - home hamlet
scheme would more than treble the size of @entity8 , @entity9
@entity3 went to school there and grew up in thatched cottage a mile away
in the cottage he wrote @entity344 , his first major success in 1874
villagers *picketing* college behind scheme say he would ' turn in his grave '
they are led by neighbour @entity40 , president of the @entity41
an 1800s milkmaid in the village also inspired @entity13
