by @entity0 the son of a government minister has quit the @entity3 after admitting assaulting two men in a row over racist slurs			1
@entity7 is the son of @entity8 and tourism minister @entity9 mp , who described seeing him awarded his green beret three years ago as ' one of the proudest days of her life '			1
but the 22 - year - old has quit the @entity15 after a fight outside a nightclub for which he escaped immediate punishment following a judge 's finding he was provoked			1
a judge gave him a conditional discharge because of the ' very exceptional circumstances ' of the case @entity7 , who served in @entity28 with the @entity3 , left the elite corps after being involved in a fracas outside a night club in @entity32 , @entity33 in november last year			1
he was serving as a driver with the @entity35 at @entity36 and had just returned from a four - week exercise on @entity38 when he went out clubbing with friends			2
he was caught on @entity40 punching a 20 - year - old birthday party reveller in the face after accusing him of racially insulting him and pushing another man away as he tried to separate them			1
a jury at @entity47 cleared @entity7 and fellow marine @entity48 of causing grievous bodily harm to bystander @entity50 , 19 , who suffered a broken jaw in the melee			1
@entity7 , who gave his address as the Â£ 1.8 million family home in @entity55 , had previously admitted assault by battery on @entity58 , 20 , and @entity59 , 19			1
he was given a two - year conditional discharge by the judge today			1
judge @entity62 said : ' you are of good character until that evening			2
i am quite satisfied you only acted in that way because you were on the end of vile and objectionable racist taunts			0
@entity7 's mother is @entity9 , the @entity8 and tourism minister who is widely considered to be a rising star in @entity73 's cabinet ' you should not have pushed mr @entity59 out of the way or struck mr @entity58 with a punch			1
it is very difficult for anyone who is not from a minority ethnic group to understand how hurtful it is to be called a p * * * b * * * * * * or worse			0
' such are the extenuating features that i am making a conditional discharge in the light of very exceptional circumstances			0
' the judge made no order for compensation because @entity7 was ' subjected to such outrageous provocation '			1
@entity7 's mother , @entity88 , is one of @entity73 's a-listers who became conservative mp for @entity91 and the @entity92 at the last election			1
she has served as a junior minister at the @entity95 , where her responsibilities included women , equality , and victims ' rights			2
the incident involving her son broke out on a pavement in @entity32 , @entity33 when @entity7 got into an argument with mr @entity58 , who he said had repeatedly called him a ' p * * * c * * * '			1
@entity40 showed mr @entity58 shout something as mr @entity59 stepped in to try to keep them apart and @entity7 then pushed him away before punching mr @entity58 in the face and grabbing mr @entity50 in a headlock and dragging him to the ground			2
@entity7 was then chased by mr @entity58 and mr @entity59			2
mr @entity50 got up but was then felled by a blow from mr @entity48			0
@entity7 , of @entity112 , @entity55 , and @entity113 , 30 , of @entity114 , denied causing grievous bodily harm to mr @entity50 and were found not guilty at @entity47 after a week - long trial			1
defence barristers had argued it was impossible to say who had inflicted the broken jaw and that both were acting either in self defence or in defence of the other			0
the prosecution said the two men were acting together in a joint enterprise but the @entity40 showed @entity113 was not even in the picture when @entity7 started the fight			2
@entity7 claimed he reacted to racist abuse from mr @entity58			2
he said he had experienced racial ' banter ' in the @entity3 , including being called ' @entity132 ' , but this abuse was different			1
he said : ' i do n't take offence at racial banter but it is different if someone who you do n't know says it in a nasty way			2
i am not going to take it			0
' i took my coat off because i was going to confront him and ask him what his problem was and why he was saying this			0
if he had said sorry i would 100 per cent have walked away			0
' a jury at @entity47 cleared @entity7 of causing grievous bodily harm after a week long trial he added : ' he used the same words again and his friend was keeping me back			1
he grabbed me and was telling me to eff odd			0
i pushed mr @entity59 away and punched mr @entity58 in the face			0
' i got mr @entity50 in a headlock and got him to the floor			0
i did not hit him			0
i grabbed him because i saw his hand come up in my peripheral vision			0
i had no quarrel with him or mr @entity59			0
' @entity7 said he has left the @entity3 since the incident and is now working as a civilian and has a girlfriend who is eight - months pregnant			1
mr @entity58 told the jury he could not remember making any racist comments			0
@entity113 , who is a special forces medic , said he had not been with @entity21 in the club but came out to see him being attacked and had rushed to his aid			0
he thought mr @entity50 was about to corner @entity7			2
he said he hit him to prevent him doing so .			0

@entity7 , son of @entity166 @entity9 mp , served in @entity28
he said he lashed out at man who racially abused him outside nightclub
the 22 - year - old admitted assault and was cleared of causing @entity172
a judge has now said he was ' outrageously provoked ' by racial abuse
he will escape punishment unless he commits another offence in two years
@entity47 hears he has since left the @entity3 and is *preparing* to be a father
