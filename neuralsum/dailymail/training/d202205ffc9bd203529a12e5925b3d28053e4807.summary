by @entity1 reporter published : 21:58 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 22:01 est , 31 october 2013 a medical examiner has testified saying he was unable to prove how the wife of a @entity5 doctor charged with murder died , complicating an eventual decision by jurors in the case			1
the medical examiner said that @entity11 ’s heart could have stopped beating because of a natural reaction to the toxicity of prescription drugs she was using following her recent face lift and latent heart disease			1
' i did n't believe i had enough to justify homicide , ' @entity19 testified on thursday about his finding in the case involving defendant @entity24			2
watch the video here inconclusive : medical examiner @entity19 changed the report of @entity11 's death so that it was n't necessarily a natural causes but said that it was undetermined @entity19 said an irregular heartbeat was the most probable manner of death , but he does n't know what caused it			1
a heart arrhythmia ' leaves no footprints ' that can be detected by a forensic pathologist , he said			0
while he did not directly state any alternative theories , the prosecutor laid one out for him , saying : ' if you were to learn that the defendant here drugged up @entity11 , and convinced her to get into the tub , and held her down for a little bit and it caused her death , would that scenario be consistent with how @entity11 may have died here ? ' ' yes it certainly is possible , ' @entity19 responded			1
the assistant medical examiner who drew up the first report has since died , but @entity19 said that he purposefully made it more open - ended			1
' you wonder is something else going on here , if there is motive , ' he said of the case			0
@entity19 's testimony came a day after one of @entity24 ’s mistresses testified that he once described how he could induce a heart attack in someone that would appear natural			2
@entity63 said @entity11 told her over ' pillow talk ' in 2005 that ' ` there 's something you can give someone that 's natural that 's a heart attack that 's not detectable after they have a heart attack			1
'' one of @entity19 's subordinates initially ruled that @entity11 's 2007 death was natural from heart disease , and that she had high blood pressure and was developing myocardosis , or inflamed heart tissue that could have interfered with a normal heart rate or rhythm , he said			1
investigative findings prompted @entity19 to change the autopsy finding to undetermined - and to add that drug toxicity may have played a role			2
staying quiet : @entity24 ( left ) has yet to be called to the stand , and it is not clear if he ever will those investigative findings ' raised a question as to whether this was a simple , straightforward , natural death , ' said @entity19			2
he was n't asked to elaborate on the stand			0
that said , the change to undetermined opened the way for the murder charge against @entity24			2
prosecutors have said he hounded @entity11 to get cosmetic surgery , then knocked her out with painkillers , valium and sleeping pills and left her to die in a bathtub			2
for the first time in the trial , prosecutor @entity100 suggested that @entity11 ' held her down to cause her death			1
' defense lawyers argue she had a heart attack and fell into the tub			0
@entity19 said he could n't confirm that she drowned , but it is possible			0
he said her lungs were about twice their normal weight , possibly because they were saturated with fluid or blood congestion , ' but i could n't use those findings alone to prove drowning			0
' family view : @entity116 , who is a doctor and is familiar with the drugs her father gave her mother , took the stand for a second day , repeating how she believes ' he killed her ' defense and offense : @entity11 's lawyer @entity124 ( left ) tried to poke holes in @entity116 ' credibility and prosecutor @entity126 ( right ) hails her as one of his star witnesses emergency medics previously testified @entity24 expelled two or three cups of fluid from her mouth when they performed chest compressions			1
still @entity19 said it was n't clear if the water came from her lungs or stomach			0
in addition to the medical examiner , the court also heard from one of @entity11 ’s older daughters @entity116			1
she first testified on wednesday and continued on thursday , when the prosecution tried to poke holes in her credibility			0
they argue the @entity116 , who now uses her mother ’s maiden name , has based her recollections of the events surrounding her mother ’s death on her desire to seek revenge on her father			0
she has not been shy in offering her opinion , saying explicitly why she was so determined to investigate her mother ’s death			0
‘ because i believe my father killed her , ’ she said in court on thursday			0
picture perfect : @entity24 and @entity11 , who died in april 2007 after a facelift , had eight children during her testimony on wednesday , @entity116 revealed that just days after @entity11 was found dead in the family 's bathtub , she received a phone call from her father saying that he had found a nanny for her younger siblings			1
she told the court that he started to say that the nanny 's name was @entity172 and she cut him off			2
' you mean @entity174 ? i know that woman and i know that mom was worried about you having an affair with her and you are not to bring her into this home , ' @entity116 recalled telling her father			0
he was screaming at me , " how dare you , how dare you accuse me ? " ' the court had never been told that @entity11 had suspicions about her husband cheating before , but @entity116 said that her mother had paid a service to track a phone number that her husband had been calling			1
that number was registered to @entity188 .			0

medical examiner changed the report of @entity11 's death from *originally* saying that she died of natural causes to ' undetermined '
she was found dead in a tub after an apparent *suicide*
now her doctor husband - who told a former mistress he knew how to make a murder look natural - is on trial for @entity11 's death
the couple 's children have testified saying that they believe he is *guilty*
