@entity0 expressed his delight at having @entity2 available to face @entity3 on saturday – after @entity4 agreed to temporarily excuse the player from @entity7 duty			1
with @entity10 ’ @entity9 match with the @entity11 going ahead in the middle of an international break , @entity0 asked the national team boss to temporarily ‘ loan ’ the midfielder back to him – provided he was n’t central to his plans for last night ’s game with @entity18			1
with @entity23 ’ lead at the top of the table just four points , @entity0 ’s men have the chance to briefly cut that to a single point by virtue of the @entity32 side ’s late kick - off at @entity33			1
@entity2 ( front ) trains with the @entity10 squad on the eve of their championship clash with @entity3 @entity0 is delighted to have @entity2 back for the clash , who has been released from international duty and the @entity43 manager feels having @entity2 in his ranks heightens his side ’s chances of ramping up the pressure on @entity49 ’s team ahead of next week ’s capital showdown			1
‘ @entity2 trained with us this morning and is in our squad for tomorrow , ’ @entity0 said on friday			1
‘ i had a chat with @entity4			0
he has been pleased with @entity2 and his contribution , but thankfully he ’s in agreement that we ’d like him to get a game at the weekend			2
i think he has a chance of being in our squad ! ‘ it ’s safe to say he is in the @entity7 squad for a reason , and the reason is that he has been doing well			1
‘ we are delighted he ’s back in the squad because we want all our best players available			0
on current form , @entity2 is certainly one of them			2
‘ i would imagine he would join back up with the @entity7 squad on the sunday ( ahead of tuesday ’s game with @entity69 )			1
i spoke to him and he has thoroughly enjoyed it			0
’ the next seven days promise to be pivotal as far as the race for the second tier ’s one automatic promotion spot is concerned			0
@entity2 has impressed @entity7 manager @entity4 ( background ) following his first senior call - up @entity2 scored in @entity10 ' 4 - 0 win over @entity33 last saturday and has been a key figure in the team but while acknowledging many minds are already drifting towards next weekend ’s first - versus - second clash at @entity81 , @entity0 sees saturday 's scheduling as a prime chance to crank up the pressure on the league leaders			1
speaking after rival @entity49 insisted this week that he does n’t look out for @entity10 ’ results , @entity0 said : ‘ i ca n’t speak for the @entity23 players , but i can tell you - because there is no point lying - that i look for the @entity23 result , the @entity94 result , every result			1
' but if they do n’t look for our result , then fair enough , that ’s up to them			0
i ’d be staggered if our boys did n’t look for the @entity23 and @entity94 results because that ’s part and parcel of football			1
’ next week ’s contest may briefly take the limelight away from the @entity110 semi-final with @entity111 in early february but a first meeting with the @entity114 men in three years is likely to hog the agenda thereafter			1
as if the @entity119 game does n’t have enough sub-plots already , the fact it ’s due to take place immediately after the closure of the january transfer window is another intriguing aspect			0
but @entity0 insists his @entity126 wish list - in terms of players coming and going - will be motivated solely by his club ’s long - term recovery as opposed to the chance to record a one - off famous victory over their ancient rivals			1
@entity0 celebrates during @entity10 ' clash with @entity33 , with the manager keen to make promotion priority in a @entity110 tie , @entity10 will face @entity111 for the first time since april 2012 when they lost 3 - 0 at @entity114 ‘ i ’m still speaking with the chairman ( @entity140 ) and ( consultant ) @entity141 and my job is to keep winning games			1
‘ those two gentlemen and myself know the importance of winning matches and getting out of the division			0
i still think in the grand scheme of things we have far more important league games			0
‘ i am not underselling the @entity111 game at all or the transfer window , but i would rather strengthen to win the league than strengthen to beat @entity111			1
‘ do n’t think for a minute i am undermining the @entity111 game , i am trying to totally focus on the most important thing which is trying to get out of the league			2
’ while @entity162 ’s ambitions remain under wraps , one thing the @entity160 owner will not be doing is exercising the naming right he acquired to @entity43			2
despite having bought them for £ 1m from @entity165 , @entity162 this week confirmed he had torn up that deal – a move that ’s undoubtedly popular with the vast majority of supporters			0
@entity0 fully understands the commercial pressures clubs are under and yet , as a lifelong @entity10 fan , he was relieved to learn the name of @entity43 will remain unchanged			1
‘ i ’m just glad we wo n’t get the opportunity to find that out , ’ he said			0
any good news is welcomed by the @entity10 supporters and i think the majority see it that way			2
@entity162 will not be renaming @entity43 , which will come as a relief to the majority of @entity10 supporters ‘ i can understand people trying to rename stadiums for financial purposes			1
but to the vast majority of supporters it will still remain @entity43 no matter what you put in front of it			2
’ with eight wins on the bounce and six clean sheets to boot , defender @entity192 believes a resounding win against @entity198 ’s men today will send out a message to @entity23 – before they play @entity33 and ahead of next week ’s showdown			2
‘ for me , this game is just as big as @entity23 , ’ he said			2
‘ we need to take three points and apply pressure			0
‘ obviously with @entity23 kicking off after us , it gives us a chance to do that			2
of course it will put pressure on @entity23 if we get it to within a point			0
‘ people will tell you they do n’t look at papers or their closest contenders but the first thing you do after a game is look to see how your opposition have done			0
@entity23 will be no different			0
‘ this will be the first time in the last couple of months where they might really feel the pressure			0
it ’s a totally different ball game when the pressure is on			0
we ’ll see how they deal with it			0
