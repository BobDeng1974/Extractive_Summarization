by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:52 est , 23 november 2013 updated : 14:25 est , 23 november 2013 secretary of state @entity2 has joined international talks over @entity5 's nuclear program as part of a late - stage push to reach a deal			1
the world 's most powerful countries have all brought their biggest diplomatic guns to bear in negotiations that the @entity14 hopes will prevent @entity5 from making a nuclear weapon			0
@entity5 's new moderate president , @entity16 , is hoping to bring to an end the @entity19 sanctions that have crippled his country 's economy			2
secretary of state @entity2 arrived in @entity22 , @entity23 , to join the negotiations over @entity5 's nuclear program saturday @entity2 joins the foreign ministers of @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 in @entity22 , @entity23			1
the goal is a six - month agreement to freeze @entity5 's nuclear program while offering @entity5 incentives through limited sanctions relief			1
if the interim deal holds , the parties would negotiate final stage deals to ensure @entity5 does not build nuclear weapons			2
but it was unclear whether the current round , which began wednesday , would produce any first - stage deal			0
@entity29 's foreign secretary @entity43 spoke of ' very difficult negotiations , ' saying ' narrow gaps ' remain on the same issues that blocked agreement at the last round earlier this month			1
' we 're not here because things are necessarily finished , ' @entity43 told reporters			0
' we 're here because they 're difficult , and they remain difficult			0
' @entity2 and his counterparts from @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity27 and @entity31 headed for @entity22 after diplomats said friday that @entity5 foreign minister @entity57 and top @entity59 diplomat @entity58 had made progress on a key sticking point - @entity5 's claim to a right to produce nuclear fuel through uranium enrichment			1
it is hoped that @entity2 's presence can help seal a deal between the @entity5 and western powers details were not released but it appeared the two sides were trying to reconcile @entity5 's insistence that it has a right to enrich for peaceful purposes while assuaging fears that @entity77 was secretly trying to build a bomb , a charge the @entity5 deny			1
as the talks entered an intensive phase , @entity81 spokesman @entity80 said the negotiations had reached ' the final moment , ' according to @entity27 's @entity86			2
@entity31 's foreign minister @entity88 spoke of ' a realistic chance ' for a deal ' but there is still a lot of work to do			1
' @entity28 deputy foreign minister @entity94 told @entity96 news agency that negotiations were very close to a breakthrough but ' unfortunately i can not say that there is assurance of achieving this breakthrough			2
' @entity30 foreign minister @entity103 told reporters he wanted ' a deal - but a solid deal - and i am here to work toward that end			1
' @entity30 's concern that the negotiators were rushing into a flawed deal with @entity5 helped delay an agreement during a session nearly two weeks ago			1
other obstacles include @entity5 's plutonium reactor under construction in @entity118 as well as a formula for providing limited sanctions relief without weakening international leverage against @entity5			1
@entity2 met with @entity28 foreign minister @entity122 as part of the negotiations @entity57 appeared to allude to the toughening of demands after @entity30 's intervention			1
@entity5 's @entity129 news agency quoted him as saying that back then , ' the two sides had agreement on issues but now it has reached a stage that there are various viewpoints and it is somehow difficult			2
' enrichment is a hot - button issue because it can be used both to make reactor fuel and to make nuclear weapons			0
@entity5 argues it is enriching only for power , and scientific and medical purposes , and says it has no interest in nuclear arms			0
@entity144 and its allies point to @entity77 's earlier efforts to hide enrichment and allege it worked on developing such weapons			0
@entity5 has insisted on that right throughout almost a decade of mostly fruitless negotiations			0
but @entity57 last weekend indicated that @entity5 is ready to sign a deal that does not expressly state that claim			0
@entity5 hard - liners are suspicious of talk of nuclear compromise since moderate president @entity16 took office in september , fearing his team will give not get enough in terms of sanctions relief over the six - months of any first - stage agreement			1
@entity2 was greeted by ambassador @entity161 of the @entity162 in @entity22 ( 2 - r ) , ambassador @entity163 of the @entity23 @entity164 ( 2 - l ) , and @entity166 @entity165 ( @entity167 ) several @entity166 senators - both @entity169 and @entity170 - have voiced displeasure with the parameters of the potential agreement , arguing that the @entity166 and its partners are offering too much for something short of a full freeze on uranium enrichment			1
on wednesday , @entity5 's supreme leader , ayatollah @entity178 , said his country would never compromise on ' red lines			0
' since then @entity77 has publicly reverted to its original stance - that the six powers must recognize uranium enrichment as @entity5 's right , despite strong opposition by @entity186 and within the @entity187			0
still , comments from @entity5 officials in @entity22 indicated that reverting to tough talk on enrichment may be at least partially meant for home consumption			0
in @entity22 , a senior @entity5 negotiator said the @entity5 claim to the right to enrich did not need to be explicitly recognized in any initial deal , despite @entity178 's comment , adding that the supreme leader was not planning to intervene in the talks			2
he did suggest , however , that language on that point remained difficult and that there were other differences			0
the negotiator demanded anonymity because he was not allowed to discuss the confidential talks .			0
