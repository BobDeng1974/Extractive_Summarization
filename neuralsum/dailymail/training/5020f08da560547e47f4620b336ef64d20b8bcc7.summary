by @entity0 published : 20:30 est , 8 january 2013 updated : 10:20 est , 9 january 2013 @entity2 photographs of former @entity4 agent @entity3 who has been missing for almost six years reveal the hand of the @entity8 government in his kidnapping @entity10 intelligence officials have told the @entity11			1
posing in an orange jumpsuit like those worn by detainees at @entity15 the politically charged images of @entity17 were sent directly by email to his family in 2011 - but investigators could find no trace of the source - indicating a high level of technological expertise			1
and despite the repeated denials of the @entity8 president @entity28 that the rogue state had anything to do with @entity17 's disappearance in 2007 , officials believe a professional intelligence service like @entity8 ’s @entity33 was behind the messages			1
@entity17 , a private investigator , disappeared in 2007 on the @entity8 island of @entity49			1
the @entity8 government has repeatedly denied knowing anything about his disappearance , and the disturbing video and photos that @entity17 ’s family received in late 2010 and early 2011 seemed to give credence to the idea			1
the extraordinary photos — showing @entity17 ’s hair wild and gray , his beard long and unkempt — are being seen for the first time publicly after the family provided copies to the @entity11 the video has been previously released			1
in response to @entity8 ’s repeated denials , and amid secret conversations with @entity8 ’s government , secretary of state @entity68 said in a statement in march 2011 that @entity17 was being held somewhere in @entity74			1
the implication was that @entity17 might be in the hands of terrorist group or criminal organization somewhere in @entity79 or @entity80			2
@entity17 , 64 , went missing on the @entity8 island of @entity49 in march 2007			2
@entity17 's family received these photographs of him in april 2011 the extraordinary photos ¿ showing @entity86 s hair wild and gray , his beard long and unkempt ¿ are being seen for the first time publicly after the family provided copies to the @entity11 the statement was a goodwill gesture to @entity8 , one that the @entity10 hoped would prod @entity92 to help bring him home			1
two years later , with the investigation stalled , the consensus now among some @entity10 officials involved in the case is that despite years of denials , @entity8 ’s intelligence service was almost certainly behind the 54 - second video and five photographs of @entity17 that were emailed anonymously to his family			1
the level of expertise used to send those items was too good , indicating professional spies were behind them , the officials said , speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were n’t authorized to talk publicly			0
while everything dealing with @entity8 is murky , their conclusion is based on the @entity10 government ’s best intelligence analysis			2
the photos , for example , portray @entity17 in an orange jumpsuit like those worn by detainees at the @entity10 prison at @entity15			1
the family received them via email in april 2011			1
in each photo , he held a sign bearing a different message			1
' i am here in @entity15 , ' one said			2
' do you know where it is ? ' another read : ' this is the result of 30 years serving for @entity10			1
' retired @entity4 agent @entity3 ( pictured far left ) with his family in @entity138 , @entity139 @entity8 president @entity28 has personally and repeatedly criticized the @entity10 over its detention facility at @entity15			1
@entity10 operatives in @entity80 managed to trace the cellphone used to send the photographs , officials said			2
but the owner had nothing to do with the photos , and the trail went cold			0
it was that way , too , with the hostage video the family received			1
it was sent from a cyber cafe in @entity79 in november 2010			0
the video depicted a haggard @entity17 , who said he was being held by a ' group			1
' in the background , @entity158 wedding music can be heard			0
the @entity158 people live primarily in @entity79 and @entity80 , just across @entity8 ’s eastern border			0
yet the sender left no clues to his identity and never used that email address again			0
a progression of images released by the @entity4 which shows the aging and hair growth of retired @entity4 agent @entity3 from before his kidnap in 2007 ( 1st left ) to the first image released of him in 2009 to a more recent @entity175 2011 image of the hostage @entity17 retired from the @entity4 in 1998 and became a private investigator			1
he was investigating cigarette smuggling in early 2007 , and his family has said that took him to the @entity8 island of @entity49 , where he was last seen whoever was behind the photos and video was no amateur , @entity10 authorities concluded			1
they made no mistakes , leading investigators to conclude it had to be a professional intelligence service like @entity8 ’s @entity33			0
@entity17 ’s wife , @entity194 , provided the photos to @entity11 because she felt her husband ’s disappearance was not getting the attention it deserves from the government			1
' there is n’t any pressure on @entity8 to resolve this , ' she said			0
' it ’s been much too long			0
' though @entity10 diplomats and the @entity4 have tried behind the scenes to find @entity17 , of @entity138 , @entity139 , and bring him home , both presidents @entity208 and @entity209 have said little about his case and have applied little public pressure on @entity8 for more information about @entity17 ’s whereabouts			1
@entity17 has watched more public pressure result in @entity8 ’s release of a trio of hikers , a journalist named @entity219 and a team of @entity222 sailors captured by the @entity223			1
everyone has come home except her husband			0
@entity228 ’s quiet diplomacy , meanwhile , has yielded scant results beyond the @entity8 president ’s promise to help find @entity17			2
retired @entity4 agent @entity3 with three of his daughters in @entity138 in @entity139 before his disappearance ' we assumed there would be some kind of follow - up and we did n’t get any , ' @entity17 said			2
' after those pictures came , we received nothing			0
' in one meeting between the two countries , the @entity8 told the @entity10 that they were looking for @entity17 and were conducting raids in @entity245 , a mountainous region that includes parts of @entity79 , @entity8 and @entity80 , @entity10 officials said			1
but the @entity10 ultimately concluded that the @entity8 made up the story			2
there were no raids , and officials determined that the episode was a ruse by @entity8 counterintelligence to learn how @entity10 intelligence agencies work			2
an expert on @entity257 organized crime , @entity17 retired from the @entity4 in 1998 and became a private investigator			2
he was investigating cigarette smuggling in early 2007 , and his family has said that took him to the @entity8 island of @entity49 , where he was last seen			0
@entity49 is a popular resort area and a hotbed of smuggling and organized crime			0
it is also a free trade zone , meaning @entity10 citizens do not need visas to travel there			2
@entity3 with one of his grandchildren before his disappearance in 2007 on an @entity8 resort island investigating cigarette smuggling @entity4 spokeswoman @entity278 said : ' as we near the sixth anniversary of his disappearance , the @entity4 remains committed to bringing @entity283 home safely to his family			0
' in an interview , @entity17 ’s wife said that because her husband disappeared in @entity8 , she believes her husband is still being held there			1
she does n’t think the @entity10 government has put enough pressure on @entity8 to release her husband			2
' it needs to come front and center again , ' @entity17 said			0
' there needs to be a lot more public outcry			0
' she said she has met with @entity209 and @entity297 , @entity209 ’s counterterrorism czar and nominee to run the @entity300			0
she said that both men pledged to do everything they could to free her husband			0
now , nearly six years after his disappearance , she thinks @entity8 is being let off the hook			0
' he ’s a good man , ' she said			0
' he just does n’t deserve this			0
' meanwhile , @entity3 will miss another family milestone when his oldest daughter @entity309 gets married in february			0
' he ’s missed so many , ' his wife said			0
' it ’s very upsetting			0

the photos portray @entity17 in an orange jumpsuit like those worn by detainees at the @entity10 prison at @entity15
the family received them via email in april 2011 . in each photo , he held a sign bearing a different message
' i am here in @entity15 , ' one said . ' do you know where it is ? '
