the @entity14 auto giant is set to unleash 100 self - driving cars onto the streets of @entity17 in 2017 in a large scale experiment designed to take robotic cars a step closer to accident - free driving			1
the cars use sensors , cameras and gps to analyse the traffic around them so they can navigate the roads – and other less diligent drivers – safely			2
self - driving cars will use approximately 37 miles ( 50 km ) of selected roads in and around @entity17 , which have been identified as ‘ typical commuter arteries ’ and include motorway conditions and roads with frequent traffic jams			1
‘ our aim is for the car to be able to handle all possible traffic scenarios by itself , including leaving the traffic flow and finding a safe “ harbour ” if the driver for any reason is unable to regain control , ’ said @entity48 , technical specialist at @entity49			0
the @entity14 auto giant is set to unleash 100 self - driving cars onto the streets of @entity17 in 2017 in a large scale experiment to take robotic cars a step closer to accident - free driving the self - driving technology used in the pilot scheme will allow people to hand over control to the car when circumstances are appropriate			1
the vehicles – adapted from the new @entity73 – which will be used in the experiment , can handle all driving functions from steering and braking to parking			0
the car will be able to park itself , without the driver inside it , allowing someone to ditch their car at the entrance of a car park to let the vehicle go through the tedious task of finding somewhere to park			0

they will be able to control the operation via an app ( pictured ) endorsed by the @entity14 government , the ‘ @entity108 ’ project aims to explore the societal benefits of autonomous driving , from fewer accidents to less stressful journeys to work			2
@entity114 , president and ceo of @entity49 , said : ‘ autonomous vehicles are an integrated part of @entity10 ’ as well as the @entity14 government ’s vision of zero traffic fatalities			2
this public pilot represents an important step towards this goal			0
’ ‘ it will give us an insight into the technological challenges at the same time as we get valuable feedback from real customers driving on public roads , ’ he added			0
self - driving cars will use approximately 50 kilometres of selected roads in and around @entity17 , which have been identified as ' typical commuter arteries ' ( pictured ) and include motorway conditions and roads with frequent traffic jam experts will look at infrastructure requirements for autonomous driving , customers ’ confidence in the technology and how ‘ real ’ drivers interact with an autonomous vehicle on the road			1
‘ the public pilot will provide us with a valuable insight into the societal benefits of making autonomous vehicles a natural part of the traffic environment			0
‘ smart vehicles are part of the solution , but a broad societal approach is also necessary to offer sustainable personal mobility in the future , said mr @entity48			0
@entity10 said autonomous driving will pave the way for more efficient time - management behind the wheel so that people can interact safely via phone or tablets ( pictured ) or choose to relax on the way to work the project will begin next year with customer research and technology development and the first cars are expected to be on the roads in @entity17 by 2017			1
@entity10 envisages that drivers in the future will be able to plan their drive with a mixture of autonomous and active driving to make their daily journeys more efficient			2

the vehicles - the new @entity73 - which will be used in the experiment , can handle all driving functions from steering and braking to parking			0
experts are also interested in how human drivers will interact with the robotic vehicles on the roads			0

@entity10 's self - driving cars will use 37 miles ( 50 km ) of selected roads in and around @entity17 , @entity14 in 2017 , described as ' commuter arteries '
the cars use sensors , cameras and gps to analyse the traffic around them so they can navigate the roads safely and even park themselves
the company believes autonomous driving will let people interact safely via phone or relax on the way to work to make better use of journey times
