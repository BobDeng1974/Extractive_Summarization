the mp was suspended by the @entity5 for failing to tell the chief whip she was jetting off to @entity17 to appear on the reality tv show			1
and it was confirmed yesterday that she is being investigated by the parliamentary standards officer over claims she may have breached the @entity22 ’ @entity23			1
mrs @entity6 , 55 , could be away from the @entity24 for up to a month but is still drawing her £ 65,738 mp ’s salary , while being paid up to £ 40,000 by @entity26			2
astonishingly , the @entity27 mp justified her appearance on the show by saying she ‘ mostly works seven days a week ’ and ministers are often out of the country			2
in an interview given before she left @entity33 , she claimed neighbouring mp @entity34 frequently travelled abroad without criticism in his role as a foreign minister			1
mrs @entity6 – who has been pictured sunbathing topless during a pre-show stay at a luxury hotel – said : ‘ in his ministerial role he has had 20 weeks abroad this year			0
but do they say when he is in @entity43 for weeks that he is neglecting his constituency ? ’ she claimed her constituents would understand why she has gone on the show			0
last night in @entity48 , mr @entity34 , the mp for @entity49 , said : ‘ i am surprised @entity6 believes there is some similarity between me being abroad on behalf of the @entity33 people , including my constituents , and her taking part in a tv show in the jungle			1
’ a chaperone applies sun cream to @entity6 as the @entity5 mp relaxes by a pool on the gold coast before entering the jungle for i 'm a celebrity get me out of here one of ms @entity6 ' daughters revealed last night she has taken over her @entity67 account , posting updates to her 12,000 followers the show ’s producers are understood to have told mrs @entity6 that she has been suspended by her party but sources in @entity17 say she has apparently decided to press ahead with her appearance on the show			1
an update to her 12,000 followers on twitter read : ' hello ! i can confirm @entity6 mp is in the jungle ! i ( her daughter ) will be covering her @entity67 in the meantime ! ' it is thought the tweets are being posted by ms @entity6 daughter @entity82			1
it also emerged today that ms @entity6 could be investigated over the revelations she kept another daughter , @entity85 , on the public payroll as a parliamentary aide even after she had joined a major law firm as a full - time trainee			2
@entity85 is listed on the register of @entity22 ' interests as an ' office manager / executive secretary ' in her mother 's office , despite joining @entity95 in august			1
ms @entity6 agent insisted @entity85 stopped working for her mum in august and the record had not been updated			0
earlier this year @entity85 was revealed to be dating @entity5 mp @entity99			1
@entity100 interrupted a visit to @entity102 to distance himself from the decision to suspend ms @entity6 from the @entity5 party , insisting it was made by chief whip sir @entity106 speculation has grown that mrs @entity6 could defect to @entity108 after she emerges from the jungle			1
bookies @entity110 slashed the odds that she would jump ship , making it just 2/1 that mrs @entity6 would join @entity108 before the next election and 5/1 that she would leave she leaves politics for good			2
@entity108 leader @entity117 tried the play down an imminent defection , saying : ‘ i have n’t had an application , she is in the jungle for a month			1
’ he added : ‘ i wish her well with the creepy crawlies in the jungle as opposed to the creepy crawlies in @entity125			0
’ mr @entity117 said the conservative party had gone too far in suspending mrs @entity6 : ‘ if one of my meps who was not a frontbench spokesman decided to go into the jungle , i would see it as an opportunity to reach an audience of 16 million			2
’ ms @entity6 has long been linked with a defection to the @entity33 @entity108 , but sources warn of a ' personality clash ' with leader @entity117 @entity108 mep @entity137 said he would delighted if mrs @entity6 eventually joined @entity108			1
‘ we like her , she is feisty and has balls			0
’ he added : ‘ i ’m not sure this jungle thing is a good idea , i ’d rather she came straight to us			0
' but reality tv did not seem to harm @entity145 when he won @entity146			0
it does n’t seem to matter what one does these days , it makes you wonder what you have to do to not get elected			0
’ ms @entity6 was suspended by the @entity5 after jetting out to @entity17 without telling the prime minister what she was up to			1
breaking her silence since arriving in @entity17 , the 55 - year - old revealed her fears about missing her daughters , not being able to drink coffee and not knowing who won the @entity160 election			2
but she could not resist one last swipe at the @entity162 - educated pm , declaring : ‘ i do not like arrogant people who think they are born to rule			0
’ she said : ' i am the first politician to go on i ’m a celebrity … @entity10 ! ' a lot of people do n’t vote and if they can see i am a normal mother who comes from a poor background and who did n’t go to a posh school , they may think they can be a politician too			0
maybe they will trust us more			0
' i know there will be a backlash that i am going on this show , but i would like to point out that i have never before taken a week away in @entity179 time whereas a lot of other @entity22 have			2
' the 55 - year - old triggered a political storm when she jetted off to @entity17 without telling mr @entity100 , party whips or even her local activists			1
but she said she thought the pm would be pleased to have her out of the way : ' i am a thorn in his side			0
' write caption here mr @entity100 has distanced himself from the suspension of errant mp @entity6 from the @entity5 over her appearance in the @entity17 jungle			1
the prime minister made clear the decision to suspend the @entity197 mp over her unsanctioned appearance in i ’m a celebrity was made by the chief whip , sir @entity106			1
when news broke of her decision to sign up for the show and its famous ‘ bushtucker trials ’ , mr @entity100 ’s aides had suggested that if she wanted to make a fool of herself on national television , it was up to her			2
but as fellow mps reacted with fury to ms @entity6 , they were quickly briefing that mr @entity100 had decided she should be reprimanded			0
in another change of tone , mr @entity100 did nothing to claim the credit yesterday			2
in his first comments on the affair , he said at the close of his visit to the @entity220 : ‘ i think the chief whip has made the right decision , he ’s responsible for these things			1
i think it was well made , well explained and he ’s done the right thing			0
’ the change of heart suggests the premier does not want to be seen to have over-reacted to a woman who once described mr @entity100 and the chancellor as ‘ two arrogant posh boys ’			0
but a poll of 5,500 people for @entity233 showed the public was overwhelmingly behind the decision to suspend mrs @entity6			0
some 86 per cent backed the action , while just ten per cent thought the @entity5 party was wrong to suspend her			2
@entity238 - the outgoing @entity5 mp for @entity239 who stood down last month to spend more time with her rock band manager husband in @entity160 - accused @entity242 of ‘ demeaning ’ parliament			1
mrs @entity238 added : ‘ celebrity is fleeting ; laws actually matter			0
i envy and honour my former colleagues , on all sides , who are still making them			0
’ other senior politicians also poked fun at @entity242 during prime minister ’s questions			1
@entity253 , standing in for mr @entity100 , said : ‘ when i heard she had been sent to the jungle to eat insects , i thought that despite the appearance of civility from our new chief whip , this indicated a new disciplinarian approach in our whips ’ office , ’ he said			1
@entity266 deputy leader @entity265 added : ' i am beginning to have quite a lot of sympathy with ( ms @entity6 )			0
all those rats and snakes ... and that ’s before she went to the jungle			0
’ but former @entity275 mp @entity274 , who has also been on the show , tweeted : ‘ pls back @entity6 - victim of witch hunt by her party , and ‘ on trial ’ with no opportunity to even know she ’s been suspended			0

@entity284 asked to investigate claim she has broken @entity22 ' code of conduct
prime minister insists it was chief whip sir @entity106 's decision to withdraw the @entity5 whip
