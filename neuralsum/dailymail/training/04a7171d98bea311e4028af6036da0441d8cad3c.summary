@entity0 has celebrated 10 years since his @entity2 debut this week with the club ’s supporters optimistic the arrival of @entity6 and the threesome @entity0 will now help make up along with the former @entity9 striker and @entity10 could open another illustrious chapter in his career			1
‘ @entity24 ’ might not roll off the tongue like the ‘ @entity14 ’ but the prospect of @entity6 , @entity0 and @entity10 eclipsing @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 has @entity2 fans believing that at the grand old age of 27 , and with 10 years at the club already behind him , @entity0 can be the star of another formidable forward line			1
from the moment the star signed a serviette at the age of 13 in december 2000 to confirm his arrival at the club 's famed @entity32 academy , the record books have been rewritten			2
@entity0 first exploded on to the scene at @entity2 playing on the left of a front three that boasted @entity37 and the @entity39 ’s good friend @entity38			1
that trio won the @entity53 in 2009 and when @entity37 was sold @entity0 linked up with @entity68 forwards @entity66 and @entity69 winning the @entity53 again in 2011			1
there were fears that @entity0 ’s star was burning out last season as the burden of carrying @entity76 ’s @entity75 hopes on his shoulders in @entity78 began to take their toll			0
but with the @entity75 now behind him the 27 - year - old looks back to his mesmerising best once again and ready to break more records			1
the @entity10 connection that stuttered last season has finally sparked into life and the two seem to have a telepathic understanding on the pitch with @entity0 so often the provider for the @entity78			1
the addition of @entity6 means it ’s not only a front three likely to wow spectators and fill best - goal showreels but also one that will intimidate defences			1
the work - rate of the @entity96 winner means that defences will be under constant pressure and that will bring errors and opportunities for @entity0 to take advantage			2
the @entity39 has always looked more comfortable with an aggressive , goal - hungry centre forward in the team alongside him			0
he thrived alongside @entity37 and when @entity105 replaced @entity37 he benefited from @entity68 ’s record scorer ’s presence in the team			0
@entity6 joined @entity2 this summer in a £ 75m deal from @entity9 after impressing at @entity110 @entity6 was awarded the @entity111 after scoring 31 @entity113 goals for @entity9 last season despite his talents , @entity0 was unable to inspire @entity76 to @entity75 glory against @entity116 this summer @entity0 is a four - time @entity117 winner - here he is with the @entity117 trophy in 2012 @entity2 6x @entity120 titles ( 2004 - 05 , 05 - 06 , 08 - 09 , 09 - 10 , 10 - 11 , 12 - 13 ) @entity121 ( 05 - 06 , 08 - 09 , 10 - 11 ) @entity122 ( 08 - 09 , 11 - 12 ) @entity123 ( 09 - 10 , 11 - 12 ) @entity124 ( 05 - 06 , 06 - 07 , 09 - 10 , 10 - 11 , 11 - 12 , 13 - 14 ) 2x @entity125 ( 09 - 10 , 11 - 12 ) @entity76 1x @entity126 ( 2004 - 05 ) @entity127 ( 2008 ) @entity128 @entity130 awards ( 2009 , 10 , 11 , 12 ) 1x @entity131 ( 2009 ) @entity132 ( 09 - 10 , 11 - 12 , 12 - 13 ) 3x @entity120 top goalscorer ( 09 - 10 , 11 - 12 , 12 - 13 ) 4x @entity53 top goalscorer ( 08 - 09 , 09 - 10 , 10 - 11 , 11 - 12 ) @entity0 's position on the pitch is also likely to change when @entity6 finally comes into the side alongside him			1
@entity138 is aware that the team has lost its best passer of the ball in @entity142			0
who is no longer a regular starter			0
therefore , he wants to encourage @entity0 to play a little deeper than in previous seasons to offer up the assists that were once @entity142 ’s trademark			0
when the @entity39 drops into midfield dragging central defenders with him @entity138 wants @entity6 filling the vacant space and occupying the centre - forward territory			2
as well as new team - mates and the slight change to his new position on the pitch there are also new records to be broken			0
one in particular looms large because of the prospect that it will be achieved in , of all places , the @entity159			0
legendary @entity161 striker @entity160 is currently the league ’s leading scorer on 251 goals			1
@entity0 is just two goals behind on 249			2
the @entity39 might not play 90 minutes on saturday against @entity165 having only arrived back in @entity68 from international duty late on wednesday afternoon			0
if he does not play a full part in the game there is every chance he will not smash the record against the minnows			0
that sets up the mouthwatering prospect – for @entity2 fans at least – that he will do so against @entity176 at the @entity159 in 10 days ' time			1
it would leave @entity176 fans with the dilemma of whether or not to pay tribute to their most feared rival or not			0
they showed their class back in 2005 when to a man they stood to clap @entity38 after he had destroyed them in a big win for @entity2 on enemy territory			0
if @entity0 can break the record and earn the applause of the @entity159 in the process he will really have shown once again how there is nothing he is not capable of , even after a decade in the famous red and blue shirt			2
@entity0 ( right ) is three goals away from breaking @entity160 's all - time @entity120 goalscoring record of 251 the @entity39 could break the record with a goal at the @entity159 , where he scored in 2011 a montage showing @entity0 's famous goal against @entity200 in 2007 , when he beat half the opposition team			1

@entity0 , @entity10 and @entity6 are set to form a devastating trio
@entity0 is celebrating 10 years since his @entity2 debut
the 27 - year - old is three goals away from breaking @entity160 's all - time @entity120 goalscoring record of 251
he has scored an average of a goal per game in @entity120 ( minutes per goal )
@entity0 has never been sent off for @entity2 in *284* league matches
