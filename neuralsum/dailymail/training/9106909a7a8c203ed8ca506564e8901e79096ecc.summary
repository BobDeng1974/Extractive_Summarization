by @entity0 published : 10:56 est , 7 february 2013 updated : 04:30 est , 8 february 2013 a historic tall ship , one of only 60 of its kind ever built , has sailed on to the market with a price tag of £ 2million			0
the @entity6 liner , which is considered a national treasure by the government , has been berthed on @entity9 in @entity10 since 2010			1
more than 60 dedicated sea - lovers volunteer to keep her afloat but it could now leave @entity14 after more than a century in our waters			1
beauty : one of @entity14 's most historic sailing ships is for sale but it will cost the buyer £ 2million dedicated : crew members ( @entity23 ) : @entity24 and @entity25 prepare the tall ship @entity6 for the new sailing season in @entity10 's historic harbour living history : the last triple masted @entity30 , the @entity6 , on a voyage in summer 2006 off @entity32 in @entity33 her owner , @entity34 , has been taken ill and is now making plans for her future , and needs to sell the vintage voyager			1
at the request of the @entity41 , auctioneers @entity38 of @entity39 has valued the ship is £ 2million			0
after being built in 1900 , the @entity6 joined the @entity43 along with a core collection of fifty ships			2
the 113 - year - old vessel was built at @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity49 , and has already attracted interest from the @entity51 with an offer of £ 2.3million			1
classed as a @entity54 by the secretary of state for culture , the ship is used by the @entity10 maritime museum education department in its work with local children			1
the @entity59 has been associated with the ship since 1972 , and at his request she attended the @entity64 on the @entity65			0
since the patriotic celebrations last year , she has attended the @entity67 and so completed a sailing season of more than 2,000 miles			2
labour of love : @entity71 cleans to original bell of @entity6 and may tall ship which is officially a national treasure according to the government hard work : crew member @entity24 attaches the name tag of the tall ship to its bow historic : the 113 - year - old tall ship @entity6 , built at @entity47 in @entity48 , has already attracted interest from the @entity51 with an offer of £ 2.3m so far an offer has been received from a foreign buyer , however the sale must be subject to scrutiny by the @entity41 , who have to issue an @entity88 before it can proceed			1
because the @entity6 is on the @entity43 , this has been refused temporarily			2
it will be granted in coming months if funding can not be raised to keep her in the @entity14			0
the deadline for expression of interest in achieving that is february 19			0
any sums of money raised towards the £ 2million asking price will be gap funded by the @entity41			0
because of the way this is calculated , raising considerably less than half this sum would ensure her future as a @entity10 attraction or elsewhere			2
if such interest is forthcoming , a business plan will be produced for the ship ’s future management and it will probably stay where it is or go to another @entity14 port .			0

@entity6 and may liner could leave @entity10 for @entity116 unless cash is found
113 - year - old @entity119 is classed as a national treasure by the government
