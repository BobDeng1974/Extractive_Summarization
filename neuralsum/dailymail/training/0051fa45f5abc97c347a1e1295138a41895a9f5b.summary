a former defence minister has threatened to derail @entity2 ’s promise to guarantee a rising foreign aid budget			1
sir @entity4 said if the prime minister backs a law forcing the government to spend high amounts on foreign aid , then backbench @entity10 will demand a similar pledge on defence spending			1
the aid law , which has passed its second reading in the @entity15 and is now due to go to committee stage , would compel future governments to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid			1
this would mean further rises in the foreign aid budget , which has already reached £ 12billion a year			1

despite massive injections of foreign aid since the fall of the @entity32 in 2001 , @entity24 remains desperately poor sir @entity4 , mp for @entity34 , said @entity36 opponents will attempt to amend the @entity37 so it also commits @entity39 to spending two per cent of national income on defence			1
as a @entity43 member , @entity39 is currently required to spend that exact percentage of our income on defence			2
but so far the government has not committed to do so beyond 2016			0
sir @entity4 said : ‘ this bill is the sort of thing that drives traditional conservative supporters to @entity53			0
‘ people wonder , what is the prime minister doing ? they do not get why he is promising to spend billions more on aid while he is making soldiers redundant			0
’ the warning came after a report by the @entity61 ’ @entity62 found that @entity39 aid ‘ does not have any discernible impact on freedom in developing countries ’			1
the report examined the progress of 28 countries which have received @entity39 taxpayers ’ money , measuring the impact of aid spending against benchmarks laid down by international organisations			2
these included the @entity76 , which published a measure of trade and property freedom , and @entity80 , which measures political and civil liberties			0
out of the countries which received @entity39 aid , 12 showed no changes in their measured levels of economic and political freedoms over a decade			2
six countries had a falling score while just three – @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 – had freedom levels that improved with increasing aid			2
four countries – @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 – had improved freedom scores even though the amount of aid they received from @entity39 went down			1
@entity102 , which ceased to get @entity39 aid in 2011 , had a falling score , and @entity106 ’s share of @entity39 aid money went down while its measured levels of freedom stayed much the same			0
the report said : ‘ international organisations are critical in the global effort to tackle poverty , but the @entity114 , recipient governments and non-governmental organisations must not push donor governments into believing that financial inputs are more important than actual outcomes			0
’ sir @entity4 , mp for @entity34 , said @entity36 opponents will attempt to amend the @entity37 so it also commits @entity39 to spending two per cent of national income on defence @entity126 , chief executive of the @entity61 ’ @entity62 , said : ‘ too often , @entity39 taxpayers ’ money is spent propping up governments that refuse to grant fundamental freedoms			1
‘ the arbitrary spending target of 0.7 per cent so loved by politicians means money is spent for the sake of it , rather than for any obvious need			0
’ but a spokesman for the @entity114 said : ‘ @entity39 promotes freedom by backing fair elections , a free press and individual rights , and we should be proud of that			0

aid law would compel governments to spend 0.7 *%* of national income on aid
foreign aid budget has already reached £ 12billion a year
*tories* want @entity39 to spend two per cent of national income on defence
a report shows that freedom in many countries has *n't* improved despite aid
