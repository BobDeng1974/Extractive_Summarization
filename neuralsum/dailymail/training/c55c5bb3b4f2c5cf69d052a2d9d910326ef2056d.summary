read @entity0 on why @entity1 is a man stuck in the past on the issue of race @entity5 owner @entity1 is the subject of a new @entity8 race investigation after making extraordinarily offensive remarks about @entity11 people and the @entity12			1
@entity1 , 77 , attempted to defend the appointment of controversial scot @entity14 as his new manager by playing down racist , sexist and homophobic texts sent and received by the 42 - year - old while he was manager of @entity18			1
but in doing so , @entity1 only managed to whip up a fresh storm by claiming his manager 's texts referring to ' @entity22 ' and @entity11 pursuing money were merely indicative of general opinion in this country			1
' nobody likes losing money			2
do you think @entity11 people chase money a little bit more than we do ? i think they are very shrewd people			1
it 's telling the truth			2
jewish people love money , @entity48 people love money ; we all love money			1
' if any @entity48 said he has never called a @entity22 a ' chink ' he is lying			0
there is nothing bad about doing that			0
it 's like calling the @entity59 brits or the @entity61 paddies			0
' @entity1 's remarks came in an interview published online by the @entity64			1
shortly before that , the @entity5 owner had learned that one of the club 's shirt sponsors — @entity70 — was severing ties with @entity5 as a result of the decision to appoint @entity14			1
a second commercial partner , drinks supplier @entity75 , also cut its links with the club over the @entity14 arrival			1
@entity14 himself is still under investigation by the @entity8 for his part in the text scandal uncovered by @entity83 in august			1
this means that @entity5 manager and his club owner find themselves in the undignified position of being investigated by the @entity8 for similar alleged offences at the same time			1
@entity1 had claimed at a press conference to unveil @entity14 as manager on wednesday that @entity8 sources had told him there were unlikely to be any charges brought against his new coach			1
but the @entity8 said : ' we wish to make it clear that the @entity8 investigation into the conduct of @entity14 remains ongoing and no assurances have been given by the @entity8 as to the outcome of this case			1
the @entity8 did not come into possession of the relevant evidence relating to the messages until mid-october			1
' the @entity8 is still investigating whether these messages indicate a culture in which other acts of a discriminatory nature may have taken place			1
this process inevitably takes time			0
' @entity70 ended their sponsorship deal with @entity5 over @entity14 's appointment @entity14 , who was sacked by @entity18 's @entity114 owner @entity113 last @entity115 , took @entity5 training for the first time on thursday as he prepares them for his first game , at home to @entity120 on saturday			1
now , however , there is a fresh storm to weather , even if it was not one of his own making on this occasion			0
@entity1 tried to back down from his comments when contacted by @entity83			1
he said : ' i do n't know how it 's come across but it 's unfair if it 's come across like that			1
what i said is this : @entity14 criticised somebody and called them a name			2
we all get called names			0
we get called @entity138 , brits			0
the @entity140 get called jocks			0
and we do n't take a blind bit of notice			0
i do n't know what all this is about			0
@entity1 's archaic views have been slammed by the @entity148 ' there 's a big difference if you criticise a black person because that is something i would never ever do or agree to			1
' i would never even dream of that			0
that is something that is totally taboo			0
everybody on the planet is equal and everybody who plays football is equal and i believe in that			0
i go to @entity160 a lot			0
i have friends , black people , white people , everybody is the same and everybody should be treated the same on the planet and that 's all i have to say on the subject			2
we are all equal under the sun. ok ? ' @entity1 later appeared on @entity26 in an attempt to repair some of the damage and apologised for his published comments , saying : ' i would never upset a @entity11 person , i hold them in the highest regard			1
i have loads of @entity11 friends			2
if anyone takes offence to what i 've said , please accept my apologies			0
' it 's either a misquote , or i 've done 50 interviews that day			0
please accept my sincere apologies if they feel that way			0
' i 've got loads of @entity12 friends too			2
i would never insult the @entity12			2
they take that name ( chinks ) a bit more serious , and they get more upset than the @entity59 people do ( about the name @entity193 )			0
i understand the @entity12 and i understand their view completely			2
i apologise on my behalf and on behalf of the club			0
' our reputation , i do n't want it tarnished			0
we 're not the biggest club , but we 're very , very honest and we 're a happy club			0
' @entity1 appeared on @entity200 late on thursday night and apologised for his comments @entity1 's decision to hand @entity14 a return to football has been widely criticised sponsors @entity70 — who became @entity5 's first ' back of the shirt ' sponsor in the summer — had explained earlier their decision to withdraw over @entity14 's arrival			1
a spokesman said : ' the texts mr @entity14 has admitted to sending are wholly unacceptable — and the thoughts expressed within them are a shocking reminder of a past we thought football had left behind			2
a team that would employ a man who expresses views such as these is not the kind of team @entity70 wish to deal with			2
' asked about this , @entity1 expressed a rather forlorn hope that he had not damaged his club 's reputation for ever			1
' i hope i 've not , because i have no intention of doing that , ' he added			0
' but i think when it gets to the end of the season there may be a big change in attitude , even after a few games			0
the man we have appointed , he 's a very honest and open man			0
he 's done something wrong			0
he 's made the apology			2
let 's forgive and forget			0
' one of the first people to criticise @entity1 , before the apology on @entity26 , was @entity245 joint chairman @entity244 , who is @entity11			1
@entity83 's @entity0 exclusively broke the story about @entity14 's obscene messages he said : ' his remarks are offensive			1
i hope he retracts it because it will damage relationships between him and many other people			0
i hope @entity1 will see the hurt this has given many people , retracts it and says he did n't really mean it			1
' ' if i have upset one person i apologise , ' @entity1 told @entity260			2
' all i was trying to say was that @entity11 people are very similar to the @entity48 people in the desire to work hard and get money			1
i did n't think that i did anything wrong in that			0
' kick it out , the game 's equality and inclusion organisation , also released a statement in response to @entity1 's comments , saying : ' the remarks act as another example of the culture which continues to exist within football , and further prove that some in positions of power seem comfortable sharing those views either privately or publicly			1
' these comments must not go unchallenged and have to be investigated by the @entity8			1
' we wish to make it clear the @entity8 investigation into the conduct of @entity14 and @entity286 remains ongoing and no assurances have been given by the @entity8 as to the outcome of this case			1
in the particular and exceptional circumstances of this case , the @entity8 would like to provide some clarification as to the status of the investigation			2
the @entity8 did not come into possession of the relevant evidence relating to the messages until mid-october			2
this came out of many thousands of emails and texts and we are still in the process of obtaining additional information			0
@entity286 and @entity14 are both the subject of an @entity8 investigation the @entity8 is still investigating whether these messages indicate a culture in which other acts of a discriminatory nature may have taken place			1
this process inevitably takes time			0
both mr @entity14 and mr @entity286 are fully co-operating with the ongoing process			2
we fully appreciate the need to act expeditiously on this matter			0
however , it remains a complex investigation and the @entity8 will make no further comment at this time .			1
