shock : clean - living grandmother - of - two @entity1 had no idea how she could have contracted @entity3 @entity3 can seem like a disease other people get			1
the virus is traditionally associated with tattoos and intravenous drug use , and @entity9 and @entity10 are amongst those who have suffered with it			0
imagine , then , how clean - living grandmother - of - two @entity13 felt when she discovered she had it , following blood tests after a heart operation in 2010			1
' my gp was dumbstruck and so was i , ' says @entity1 , 50 , from @entity19 , east @entity20			0
' i 've never used drugs or had any tattoos and i had no symptoms - i felt fine			0
i had no idea where i could have got it from			0
' @entity3 is contracted by blood to blood contact , and once in the body , the virus causes liver cirrhosis and failure			1
it raises the risk of liver cancer , too , because it kills cells , causing a high turnover of new cells , meaning more chance of mutation			1
however , it takes 30 years on average after infection for cirrhosis to set in , and frighteningly , it is symptomless until then			1
' my doctor asked if i 'd ever had a blood transfusion , ' says @entity1 , a gp receptionist who lives with her long - term partner			1
' and i had - i was born with a heart defect and so i 'd had an operation on it when i was 16			0
i also had a transfusion when i had my daughter in 1982 , because i lost a lot of blood			1
' he said it must be that , because they only started screening blood used in transfusions in 1992			2
it was pretty scary that i 'd had it all that time without realising			0
the doctors said if it had n't been picked up , within five years i 'd have had cirrhosis of the liver			1
' experts are warning that the @entity68 is about to see an explosion of cases like @entity1 's , where people who caught hepatitis c during its peak in the 1970s and 1980s are only now discovering they have it			1
new diagnoses of the virus shot up by a third between 2010 and 2012 in @entity77 , according to @entity77			0
intravenous drug use and blood transfusions are the most common causes , but the virus can be caught through medical procedures , including dental work , and tattoos and piercings			2
this is less of a risk now in the @entity68 , but it 's still a major threat if you have such procedures in certain countries where sterilisation standards are poor			1
it can also , more rarely , be passed from one to another through sharing toothbrushes ( if the gums bleed ) and razors			0
frightening : one of the early symptoms of @entity3 is tiredness , a symptom that many people disregard this summer it was revealed that thousands of women in @entity77 were at risk of hepatitis c after it emerged that a retired gynaecologist had practised for years while unknowingly carrying the virus			1
two patients are already confirmed to have been infected although the risk is very low , since it would need to involve the doctor scratching him or herself during an operation			2
the condition is curable , so doctors are urging those who may be at risk - including anyone who had a blood transfusion before 1992 - to get themselves tested			1
although all donated blood is now screened for hepatitis c , it would n't show up if you were having a routine blood test for something else			2
you 'd need to be specifically tested for the hepatitis c virus to find out			0
' the liver has an an extraordinary repair capacity , so it can take decades for any problems to develop , ' says @entity133 , professor of hepatology at @entity134			2
' it 's like the petrol tank in your car - it will run at 100 miles per hour but then when the final drop of petrol goes , it suddenly stops			2
' it was pretty scary that i 'd had it all that time without realising			0
the doctors said if it had n't been picked up , within five years i 'd have had cirrhosis of the liver			1
' ' about 30 per cent of people with hepatitis c already have cirrhosis by the time they are diagnosed			1
' hospital admissions for hepatitis c - related end stage liver disease and liver cancer in @entity77 have increased from 574 in 1998 to 2,266 in 2012			1
' the trouble is the earliest symptoms will be feeling unwell and tired , ' says @entity158 , chief executive of the @entity159			1
' and these people may think , “ i 'm 50 , it 's normal			1
” ' professor @entity133 says this group could also have unwittingly passed it on to their children and grandchildren - around one in 20 mothers with hepatitis c will infect their baby			0
luckily , @entity1 's daughter was not affected			2
experts say the rise in diagnoses may also be partly due to new infections			0
last month , the @entity175 warned that diseases such as hepatitis c were becoming a growing problem among people injecting tanning drugs , dermal fillers such as @entity182 , and steroids			2
another concern is home tattoo kits which could cause problems if needles are shared			0
' i do have particular concerns about people going abroad to have cheap dental treatment , ' adds professor @entity133			2
' @entity193 , for example , has a huge problem with hepatitis c , and @entity196 too			0
' the cause : @entity1 , pictured with her daughter , contracted @entity3 after receiving a blood transfusion when giving birth			1
this was before doctors started screening blood used in transfusions @entity1 's treatment involved a weekly injection of the drug interferon , which stimulates the immune system to fight the virus , and a daily tablet of ribavarin , which stops the virus spreading			1
six months of treatment worked for @entity1 , who is now clear of hepatitis c , but the side - effects , including nausea , insomnia , flu - like symptoms and poor concentration , can be debilitating			0
' the only thing i could keep down was soup , ' says @entity1			0
' they had to stop the treatment in the fifth month because i was too ill - i 'd lost two stone			0
' treatments for hepatitis c cure 75 to 80 per cent of patients , but new options , including tablets that will replace interferon injections , are on the way with improved success rates and fewer side - effects			0
undoubtedly , the sooner a patient is diagnosed , the better their chances of recovery			0
' if it were n't for the fact i had it picked up after my surgery , i 'd still be walking round with hepatitis c , oblivious , ' says @entity1			0
' if there 's any chance you could have it , go and get tested			2

@entity3 is contracted by blood to blood contact
once in the body , it causes liver cirrhosis and failure and raises cancer risk
cirrhosis only sets in 30 years after infection ; it 's symptomless until then
one of the earliest indications is fatigue and feeling unwell
but many people disregard these as normal signs of aging
