by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 last updated at 3:44 pm on 22nd october 2011 surrounded by smoke and flames from @entity6 bombs , the image of @entity10 ’s rising above the scarred @entity9 skyline became a symbol of the nation ’s @entity12			2
but on friday a rag - tag group of anti-capitalist protesters camping on its doorstep achieved what even @entity18 ’s bombers only once managed to achieve – and forced the cathedral to shut			1
@entity22 @entity21 said the decision to close until further notice was made with ‘ heavy hearts ’ after the makeshift camp on its steps doubled in size during the past week			2
disruption : anti-capitalists continue to camp outside @entity10 's despite the cathedral announcing it will have to close for the first time in 72 years due to the protest rows of multi coloured tents surround the cathedral which closed indefinitely at 5pm on friday protesters gather for a meeting in front of @entity31 on friday alongside the media following the closure announcement closing : @entity42 , the right reverend @entity41 announces he is concerned about fire hazards the protesters could n't stop a wedding taking place at @entity10 's today			1
@entity47 arrived at the cathedral to marry @entity49 - against a backdrop of dozens of tents and a banner reading ' capitalism is crisis '			1
the bride , a @entity56 graduate , appeared to put on a brave face and smiled at onlookers as she walked in through a side entrance as police stood by			2
just yards away , the front steps of @entity10 's were teaming with protesters who have vowed to stay put for the immediate future			1
earlier , bride and groom were forced to reassure their guests that the ceremony would go ahead despite the action			2
in a message posted on @entity72 , they wrote : ' we 're looking forward to seeing friends and family at the wedding today , and are pleased that it is going ahead as planned			2
love @entity49 and @entity47 xxx '			2
this followed an upbeat message last night which stated : ' for anyone who is worried about tomorrow - do n't be			2
the recent announcement does n't affect us ; it just means that we have run of the house : ) xxxx			2
' ahead of the service , ushers insisted @entity87 , an account manager for a pr company , was not concerned by disruption			2
' she just wants to enjoy her day - if she ever gets here , ' one joked			2
he blamed ‘ health and safety ’ concerns caused by the @entity93 movement , which has been located in @entity94 since saturday after being barred from the @entity95			1
and he begged the activists – who include teachers , social workers , mothers with children and an extra from @entity102 – to leave what has become known as ‘ @entity104 ’			2
the continuing disruption has seen the cathedral ’s earlier act of charity backfire			2
on sunday , defending the rights of the protesters , @entity110 chancellor the @entity111 had asked police to leave and even invited the demonstrators in to worship			1
on friday night religious leaders described the decision to close the cathedral as a ‘ tragedy ’			0
but as the doors were locked after friday 's 3.30pm service , protesters remained defiant – and thousands more are expected to descend on the site on saturday			1
@entity10 ’s was shut for just four days during the blitz while @entity126 defused a time - delayed bomb that had hit the cathedral			0
mr @entity21 , who has been forced to cancel a visit to @entity129 , said the decision to close it again was ‘ unprecedented ’			0
he said : ‘ i have written an open letter to the protesters this afternoon advising them that we have no lawful alternative but to close @entity31 until further notice			1
' health , safety and fire officers have pointed out that access to the cathedral is seriously limited			1
' with so many stoves and fires and lots of different types of fuel around , there is a very clear fire hazard			0
‘ then there is the public health aspect which indeed speaks for itself			0
the dangers relate not just to cathedral staff and to visitors but are a potential hazard to those encamped themselves			0
‘ we have done this with a very heavy heart , but it is simply not possible to fulfil our day - to - day obligations to worshippers , visitors and pilgrims in current circumstances			1
‘ i am asking the protesters to recognise the huge issues facing us at this time and asking them to leave the vicinity of the building so that the cathedral can reopen as soon as possible			1
‘ i hope that the protesters will understand the issues we are facing , recognise that their voice has been legitimately heard , and withdraw peacefully			1
’ he said the cathedral defended the right to protest but would like to use the building for its intended use			0
the cathedral is one of @entity9 ’s best loved tourist attractions and draws up to 3,000 worshippers each sunday			1
@entity110 @entity180 , a member of the @entity182 ’s parliament , the @entity183 , said : ‘ this is a tragedy			0
clearly now the demonstrators should pack up their tents and go			1
@entity10 ’s is a greater cause then theirs and they should acknowledge that			0
‘ the cathedral is losing £ 20,000 for every day it is shut			0
it gets no state support			0
it can not afford to be shut			0
’ clergy at the cathedral have insisted that no welcome was given to the demonstrators and that their aim when the @entity93 movement arrived – targeting the nearby @entity95 rather than the cathedral – was to avoid confrontation and violence			0
people listen to an economics talk held at the so - called ' @entity201 ' setup by @entity93 protesters directly outside a branch of the @entity205 coffee chain activists ' tents fill the area in front of @entity10 's and more are expected to join at the weekend protesters play music on the steps of @entity31 ahead of the @entity31 closing its doors for the first time in living memory an activist eats in his tent at the @entity93 camp next to @entity31			1
right reverend @entity21 said the decision to close the @entity31 was made with a ' heavy heart ' the @entity10 ’s protest is already bearing the hallmarks of a more permanent set - up and is now home to a mobile library , a meditation centre and even solar panels			1
a delivery of portable toilets is expected in the next 24 hours			0
protester @entity230 said : ‘ i think this is an appallingly unchristian decision and i personally think it would be a big mistake for us to leave here			0
' this is completely unnecessary and i believe a commercially driven decision			0
’ demonstrators camp seen from the steps outside @entity31 which has asked protesters to withdraw peacefully the right reverend @entity21 , @entity42 , issued the following statement today thank you for coming today			1
it seems a very long time since the protestors arrived around the @entity31 last weekend and i want to stress at the outset that we have listened to them and indeed developed a conversation with them			1
we are delighted that the @entity9 protests have been peaceful and indeed there has been a good atmosphere generally between @entity31 staff and those dwelling in the tents around @entity10 ’s			1
there is something profound about protest being made and heard in front of this most holy place : a gathering together of those concerned about poverty and inequality facing the great @entity266			0
you actually have to be here to witness it for yourself because the extent of feeling and protest is not easily translated via media in that sense			0
but it is about the practical and safety issues which this peaceful protest has raised which i need to address with you today			1
it should be obvious to anyone approaching the @entity31 that the size of the camp and the consequent compliance issues which it inevitably raises , has increasingly put us in a difficult position			1
last night , i met with members of the chapter to discuss some of these key issues			0
as the week has gone on , and in a statement we issued earlier this week , we intimated how difficult the situation was becoming			0
as a result of that meeting , and reports received today from our independent health , @entity296 and @entity298 officers , i have written an open letter to the protestors this afternoon advising them that we have no lawful alternative but to close @entity31 until further notice			1
i have here copies of the letter clearly outlining the reasons we have had to take this dramatic course of action which i will ask my colleagues to distribute			0
the @entity295 officers have pointed out that access to and from the @entity31 is seriously limited			1
with so many stoves and fires and lots of different types of fuel around , there is a clear fire hazard			0
then there is the public health aspect which speaks for itself			0
the dangers relate not just to @entity31 staff and visitors but are a potential hazard to those encamped themselves			1
the decision to close @entity31 is unprecedented in modern times and i have asked the registrar to implement emergency procedures whereby the building remains closed but fit for purpose until such a time that we can open safely			1
our 200 staff and 100 volunteers are also being informed of this decision this afternoon			2
i want to say two simple things at this point			0
1 ) we have done this with a very heavy heart , but it is simply not possible to fulfil our day to day obligations to worshippers , visitors and pilgrims in current circumstances.2 ) that all of the chapter are at one on this and recognise the complexities of the issues facing us at this time			2
as you can see in the open letter , i am asking the protestors to recognise the huge issues facing us at this time and asking them to leave the vicinity of the building so that the @entity31 can re-open as soon as possible			1
so many people who visit this great @entity31 come here , of course , because they love the gospel of justice , peace and reconciliation [ which some of the protestors are embracing for a whole host of reasons ] , but also because they want to enjoy the peace and tranquillity of a place of prayer and pilgrimage			1
some will rightly say that the @entity182 should be alongside those seeking equality and financial probity			0
the debate about a more just society is at the heart of much of our work at @entity10 ’s and indeed we hope to contribute to the wider debate in the very near future through a report from the @entity383			0
but today is about our ability , practically , to carry on our mission with free and open access to this public space and treasured place and i hope that the protestors will understand the issues we are facing , recognise that their voice has been legitimately heard , and withdraw peacefully			0
iconic : this image of @entity394 has become a symbol of survival ... but the house of worship has closed for the first time in living memory			0

@entity402 asks protesters to pack up and go home
safety of tourists and worshippers ' at risk '
number of tents outside @entity31 increases to more than 200
