these vibrant comic book covers appear to be the epitome of science fiction , but within their eye - catching illustrations are scarily accurate predictions of life in the 21st century			0
the retro covers imagine a world where plastic surgery is common place , man walks on the moon and patients are fitted with artificial hearts			1
and although these subjects may not seem that groundbreaking today , all of the covers were published more than 80 years ago between 1929 and 1939			1

it was published in 1939 for instance , the now infamous moon landing of 1969 was predicted 40 years earlier in the @entity37 comic of 1929			1
that same year , illustrators predicted that in the future scientists would develop machines that read the subconscious mind and project its thoughts as images , titled into the subconscious			1

pictured on the right is an 1932 illustration of what a city on @entity81 might look like this retro cover of kidnapped into the @entity84 shows a man from the year 4230 travelling by time machine back to mid- 20th century meanwhile , the ' # scanners ' project allows users to manipulate a digital art installation using a headset that creates a visual record of a person 's subconscious mind			1
an animator in @entity96 said it will give people a glimpse into a dream world , and it uses a £ 100 ( $ 150 ) headset developed by technology company @entity102			0
the collection - from titles including @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 - also includes a host of recognisable scenes including one cover , created in 1939 , called @entity111			1
on the left is @entity113 , a 1939 comic about how the @entity115 is destroyed to make way for a better civilisation			2

for instance , the now infamous moon landing of 1969 was predicted 40 years earlier in the @entity37 comic of 1929 ( pictured ) deja vu , unexplained shivers down the spine , hairs on the back of your neck ... people have always believed the body has many ways of telling you something that is about to happen			1
but a recent scientific research paper claims to have discovered that your body can predict the future			0
scientists said that during tests they found proof people can anticipate events , or realise something is about to happen , without cues			0
the paper , in the frontiers of @entity156 journal , claimed that after studying people 's reactions in different tests , they found that subjects could ' predict ' that something out of the ordinary was about to happen			0
but some scientists said the findings showed scientists were looking for evidence of ' presentiment ' and did n't actually prove that it existed			0
in the image , a doctor is seen fitting a patient with an artificial heart - reminiscent of @entity174 , who become the first @entity175 discharged from hospital with a completely artificial heart in 2011			0
yesterday , @entity64 - owned @entity63 unveiled its latest version of the @entity67 robots , and the tech giant is developing software that acts like a human			2
these areas of research will pave the way for the @entity74 , featured on a comic book cover in 1939 , which shows a giant robot controlled by a human brain			1
during this year ’s @entity191 , for example , a paraplegic used a mind - controlled exoskeleton to walk on the pitch and kick the first ball of the tournament			2
and last month , scientists revealed two patients fitted with radical new mind - controlled artificial limbs that link directly with their skeleton and nervous system			2
while many of the covers appear to be a fairly accurate prediction of the future , others are thankfully yet to come to fruition			0
one comic , dubbed @entity209 in the @entity210 , sees @entity211 become an airborne city , elevated above the @entity115 ’s surface to avoid pollutants and @entity113 , in which @entity115 is destroyed to make way for a better civilisation			0
another retro cover of kidnapped into the @entity84 shows a man from the year 4230 travelling by time machine back to mid- 20th century @entity221			0
scientists may not have achieved time travel yet , but that has n't stopped it being source of fascination for science fiction writers and illustrations , today , as it was back in the 1930s			1
illustrators predicted that in the future scientists would develop machines that read the subconscious mind and project its thoughts as images , titled ‘ @entity238 ’			1
