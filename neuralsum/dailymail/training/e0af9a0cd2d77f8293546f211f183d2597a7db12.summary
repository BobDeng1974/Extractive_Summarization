@entity1 has found the net just once for his new club since joining at the end of august - against @entity12 in the @entity13 - and desperately needs to rediscover his goalscoring touch in the @entity15			0
the @entity16 has scored with just one of his last 66 shots in @entity15 action , over 21 games for @entity7 and former club @entity21			2
the striker grimaced in pain when he got back to his feet but was soon back in the thick of the action			0
one player absent from the session but expected to return at @entity61 is @entity62			0
the forward suffered a thigh injury while on international duty with @entity66 in september and @entity7 have missed his goalscoring touch			1
before his injury , @entity7 had won two of their three matches and scored six goals			2
during his absence , they have won just two of seven games and scored only eight goals			0
@entity1 , @entity45 and a determined - looking @entity75 are amused by something as they stretch prior to the training drills @entity1 leads the way in the sprint reaction drills as the striker looked sharp ahead of sunday 's visit to @entity82 @entity1 , wearing no 5 on his training kit , bursts between the poles in training @entity1 is joined by @entity45 for the pre-training stretches			1
the young @entity66 star was full of energy during the session @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 quick - step their way through a warm - up drill @entity92 gets in a shot at goal despite the close attentions of his defensive colleague @entity91 @entity92 keeps a close watch on @entity90 as they line up on opposite teams during a small - sided practice match @entity105 curls over a pass during the @entity108 training session on friday morning @entity109 midfielder @entity93 looks for a pass as @entity111 looks on in the background he played no part in the training session and @entity0 said a decision on his match fitness will be made on saturday			1
@entity62 's return will be a massive boost - he has 32 goals in 46 @entity15 matches for @entity7 , twice as many as @entity120 had at this stage			1
@entity0 said : ' we 'll see how @entity62 is tomorrow [ saturday ]			2
he 's training , looking well			0
' when @entity62 is playing , he 's one of the top @entity125 strikers			0
it 's important for him to play games to prove that consistently			0
@entity0 also confirmed that @entity128 and @entity90 are again available and they played a full part in training on friday			1
he added that @entity92 should also be fit			0
@entity45 displayed plenty of energy in training despite claiming he was feeling ' tired ' while away on international duty @entity45 started on the bench for @entity66 's @entity137 qualifier with @entity138 after complaining of fatigue @entity0 was in a good mood as he oversaw @entity7 's last training session of the week the manager gets to grips with a quartet of mannequins as he starts a free - kick drill captain @entity147 tries to win the ball as his orange - bibbed team - mates watch on @entity91 produces a no - holds - barred slide challenge on @entity90 during the training session @entity152 gets shirty in an effort to try and stop @entity109 playmaker @entity154 @entity154 is within sight of goal as he attempts to negotiate a way past young @entity159 defender @entity158 striker @entity160 contests a header with @entity162 as two of the club 's summer signings go head - to - head @entity167 @entity7 must make @entity1 behave - @entity22			1

@entity1 and @entity0 were deep in conversation as @entity7 trained at @entity25 on friday morning
@entity1 is desperate to *improve* his form , having scored just one goal since arriving at @entity173
@entity0 confirmed that @entity92 , @entity128 and @entity90 will be available for sunday 's trip to @entity8
@entity62 , who did not train with the rest of the group , will be *assessed* on saturday after thigh injury
@entity0 said the *criticism* levelled at ' tired ' @entity45 had been *unfair* , saying he needs *protection*
