but when it 's @entity7 's annual @entity6 , the rulebook is thrown out and trying to get as muddy as possible is only agenda			1
thousands of children and teenagers donned their swimming costumers and old t - shirts to wallow in the brown sludge at @entity14 in @entity15			1
the result meant children spent hours diving , sliding and throwing sludge in the gigantic mud bath			1
the fun included limbo contests and wheelbarrow races as well as the crowning of a mud king and queen – the winners were the messiest children			2
wheel barrow races were no doubt more difficult in the squelch than on dry land and when they became tired from the exertion of moving through the sludge , many just wallowed , glad to lie down in the cool brown water			2
@entity60 said : ‘ kids always have to stay clean at home			0
this is one day where they can get dirty			0
’ big order : firefighters poured 20,000 gallons of water onto 200 tons of topsoil to make the mudpit having a ball : some people were shocked about the temperatrue of the mud , but soon go began to enjoy the mud fest fun times : the delighted youngsters made delicious mud pies and there were also organised games to keep them occupied and it was n't just the children having fun - the lure of the brown sludge was too much for some parents and they also got stuck into getting muddy , although they had to join the youngsters at the end to be hosed down by a firetruck			1
@entity87 was one of the adult participants who took part			2
she said : ‘ there ’s nothing like the mud squishing between your toes			2
