by @entity0 published : 10:45 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 11:39 est , 14 january 2014 an animal shelter has banned members of the public from looking at its dogs , claiming that large amounts of visitors are ' extremely stressful ' and harms their well - being			1
the rule comes into force next week at the @entity12 kennels in @entity13 , @entity14 , run by the charity @entity16			1
visitors to the centre will now have to fill out a form before they can see any dogs , and members of staff will suggest them matches			1
@entity23 : members of the public will no longer be able to visit the dogs at @entity16 shelter in @entity14 without proving their interest in re-homing one of the animals welfare : the shelter says its new policy is in line with other animal charities , and was prompted by scientific research the shelter says this is necessary because many visitors have no intention of adopting a dog , and seeing lots of people can make the dogs less healthy and well - behaved			1
according to studies of sheltered dogs , excessive visits can lead to the dogs hiding , panting and barking more than usual			1
this in turn could make them less attractive to those who genuinely want to give them a home			2
conclusions : studies suggest that dogs which are visited excessively are more prone to barking , panting and hiding from their visitors @entity57 , the shelter 's head of animal welfare , said that they made the decision because they must put the animals ' welfare first			1
she said : ' we understand that some people will be disappointed by not being able to visit the dogs ; however our animals â€™ welfare is always our overriding priority , ' said @entity57 , head of animal welfare			1
' research carried out last summer revealed that on average just 15 per cent of the visitors to the kennels were interested in re-homing a dog			1
' for dogs , the rescue kennel environment is extremely stressful			2
we have introduced a number of techniques to reduce the negative effect but we are still seeing a deterioration of behaviour and health in the dogs in our care on a daily basis			0
' we are confident managing the number of visitors to the kennel area will significantly improve the welfare of the dogs			2
stress levels and the associated negative behaviours will be reduced			0
' the improved kennel behaviour will result in enhanced interactions between potential re-homers and the dogs and therefore better and quicker re-homing prospects			0
' commenting on the changes of procedure , a spokesman for the centre said that allowing free access to the dogs was ' doing them a disservice ' and that they have received ' positive ' feedback			0
needs a home : research suggests that dogs which are visited too often are less likely to find a home ( file photo ) shelter : the @entity117 is in @entity13 , @entity14 she said : ' our main aim at @entity16 is to re-home the dogs that have come into our care and to allow them every opportunity to be seen by their potential forever homes '			1
' if they are frightened and are hiding because of the volumes of visitors we see their chances lessen in finding a home quickly			0
we believe we are doing them a disservice to allow this to happen			0
' the feedback so far has been positive			0
we are a nation of animal lovers and we want what is best for the dogs			0
' one well - wisher , @entity141 , said : ' well done @entity57 and @entity16			0
this will ensure only genuine adopters view the dogs , and not the hordes of people who clutter up the place using it as a free viewing zoo			0
' kennels are extremely stressful places , and doing this will make the environment a little less stressful for the animals			2

the @entity12 kennels will *bring* in the new rule next week
those who want to visit the dogs will now have to fill in a form
research claims that too many visits make the dogs bark , pant and hide
the shelter claims that this is the best thing for the dogs ' welfare
