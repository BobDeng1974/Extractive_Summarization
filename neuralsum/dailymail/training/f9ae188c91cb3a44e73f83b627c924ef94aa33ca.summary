first class @entity3 : @entity1 got a taste of the elusive @entity3 yesterday , flying a box of the donut - crossiant hybrids home with her on a private jet usually , there is a two - @entity3 - per - person limit on in - store purchases , but instead of waiting in the long lines that start outside the bakery as early as two hours prior to opening , ms @entity1 was lucky enough to secure a spot on the pre-order list - which has a six - per - person limit			1

we 're all big fans ! ' waiting game : hundreds of @entity9 wait in line as early as 6am to get their hands on one of the @entity15 treats , and it seems the supermodel had to wait just like everyone else with four excited children eagerly awaiting their chance to try a @entity3 , made from deep fried thin layers of flaky croissant dough filled with tahitian vanilla cream , the supermodel spared no expense in getting them home			1

' long lines : instead of waiting in the long lines that start outside the bakery as early as two hours prior to opening ( pictured ) , ms @entity1 was lucky enough to secure a spot on the pre-order list after the success of the @entity3 - which was quietly unveiled on may 10 with a small batch of 50 , and by may 13 , had sold out of 200 by 9.30am - the @entity95 chef said business is booming			2
