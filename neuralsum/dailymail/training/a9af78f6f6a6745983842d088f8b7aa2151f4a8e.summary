if @entity1 had led @entity2 to victory over @entity4 two years ago , it ’s possible that @entity5 would still be enjoying @entity7 cuisine rather than being introduced to the culinary delights of a @entity10 pie			1
it was the defeat at the hands of the @entity13 at @entity14 that led to the @entity16 ’s resignation — and opened the door , eventually , for the @entity5 era			1
delayed for a year after the @entity20 refused to buy out the final 12 months of his contract at @entity23 , the change has been worth waiting for if the @entity25 ’s first six matches in charge are anything to go by			0
@entity5 prepares his @entity2 players for their @entity29 international against @entity4 @entity2 look a team reborn and go into the match against @entity4 at @entity33 looking to make it five wins out of seven under @entity5 , the only defeats coming against the top two sides in world rugby , @entity37 and @entity36			1
the head coach ’s time in charge has led to a change in fortunes of not just the team but also of back - row forward @entity47 , who had never been a @entity1 favourite			1
in fact , the former @entity49 star was so far out of the picture under him , he did n’t even make the 60 - strong training squad put together for the three defeats to @entity37 , @entity36 and @entity4 in 2012 that eventually led to his resignation			1
@entity47 holds no ill - will against @entity1 , but if he had still been in charge , perhaps the 29 - year - old would have been on club duty for @entity58 this weekend rather taking the field at no 8 for his country			1
the focus is the future , however , not what might have been , and @entity47 knows how tough it will be to win a regular starting place in a @entity2 team playing what he believes is the best , most exciting rugby he has seen since he made his debut against @entity71 in 2006			1
back - row forward @entity47 has been given a new lease of life under @entity5 's regime the way @entity5 , not the most demonstrative of men , has gone about his business since he took over last summer , has convinced him the national team is going places			1
‘ there is no selling of the sizzle with him , ’ said @entity47			1
‘ there is no razzmatazz and falseness			0
‘ he is just a good old - fashioned bloke , who is a good rugby coach			0
already we can see after two games of the @entity88 his imprint , his game plan , his structures and how he wants us to go about our play			2
we are definitely in a better place under him			0
‘ overall , he has made minor adjustments and has changed the basic structures of our play			2
how we get into phase play , how we keep the ball , how we stretch defences			2
all those things , those simple things , he has come in and implemented in a better way			0
‘ it is quite clear he has made a massive difference , especially when you realise this is mainly the same group of players , with a few youngsters coming in , that he is working with compared to coaches before			0
’ @entity2 players line up as they look to make it fives wins out of seven under @entity5 @entity47 , who celebrated his 29th birthday on friday , believes the @entity2 fans are also buying into the @entity5 era , with the atmosphere against @entity37 the best he had ever experienced at @entity116			1
‘ the rugby we are producing is making it more of a spectacle for our supporters and we saw that from the support we got against @entity37 , ’ he continued			0
‘ we did not win , granted , but the effort , our ability to retain the ball , the ability to stretch teams , meant we gave the supporters something to shout about			0
i have not seen that level of support pretty much since i have been involved			0
‘ that game against @entity37 was the first time i have been back at @entity116 since we lost to @entity133 in the @entity134 nine months ago , when we got humped 20 - 0			0
@entity2 showed their recent improvement , despite losing to @entity37 at @entity116 ‘ we showed absolutely nothing and produced absolutely nothing and could not create anything for our fans to get behind us for or to enjoy			2
in that space of time , to go where we have been to where we are now is great and very encouraging , but the important thing is we keep working and keep getting better			0
’ the competition for the no 8 jersey is fierce			0
@entity151 @entity150 will be eligible to play for @entity2 through residency in time for the @entity153 and with @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 also in contention , the match on the artificial surface at @entity33 is a vital one for @entity47			1
he was n’t picked for the @entity158 in @entity37 and is determined not let the showpiece occasion in @entity133 next year pass him by			2
@entity47 missed out on the last @entity153 but is determined not to let @entity133 2015 pass him by ‘ i would love to be involved in the @entity153 but rugby is a funny old game and you never know what is going to happen , ’ said @entity47			1
‘ in the life of a professional rugby player , you see injuries all the time , players in and out , coaches change their views on you			0
‘ i did n’t make @entity1 ’s squad two years ago and i know things can change very quickly , so i am under no illusions how hard i have to work to be retained by this coaching team and the effort i have to put in			2
‘ it starts against @entity4 today on an artificial surface on which it is hard to keep your feet			2
everyone will have to work hard to keep up at scrum time and at rucks so we do n’t give away stupid penalties			0
‘ this is a big game for all of us , including me , and is my chance to impress @entity5 and to be part of what i think could be a very good time for @entity2 going forward			1

@entity2 face @entity4 in their @entity194 on *saturday*
@entity5 has *transformed* @entity2 since *replacing* @entity1
@entity47 has *excelled* under the new regime and is determined to play in the next @entity153
