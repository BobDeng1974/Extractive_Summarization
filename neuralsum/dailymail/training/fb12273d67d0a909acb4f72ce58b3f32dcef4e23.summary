its developers gathered in @entity14 to demonstrate the humanoid robot 's ability to talk and it was able to answer questions from attending journalists the experiment is a collaboration between advertising and pr company @entity35 , the @entity36 , the @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 ' @entity42 was the first to go outer space , the @entity41 was the first to go to the moon , we want @entity8 to be the first to send a robot - astronaut to space that can communicate with humans , ' said @entity48 , the @entity6 project manager			1
@entity49 , ceo of @entity50 and associate professor at the @entity37 , said he hopes robots like @entity6 that hold conversations will eventually be used to assist astronauts working in space			2
' when people think of robots in outer space , they tend to seek ones that do things physically , ' said @entity49			0
' but i think there is something that could come from focusing on humanoid robots that focus on communication			0
' because @entity6 does not need to perform physical activities , it is smaller than most robots that go into space			1
