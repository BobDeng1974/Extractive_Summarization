by @entity0 follow @ @ the_topspin and @entity1 the charges brought by the @entity3 against @entity4 and @entity5 are the beginning of the end of a story that unfolded three years ago in sleepy @entity9 — 4,500 miles away from the global epicentre of match - fixing in @entity12			1
if the charges are upheld , both men are likely to be banned for life			0
the case against @entity4 has been one of the worst - kept secrets in cricket			2
@entity20 revealed back in december that he was under investigation by the @entity24 ’s anti-corruption unit , while the details of his involvement with cricket ’s underworld were laid bare in this newspaper last week			0
in the dock : former @entity31 batsman @entity4 has been charged with match fixing the only surprise is that it has taken the authorities so long to bring charges against a player who has admitted to fixing matches as long ago as 2008			2
@entity5 ’s alleged involvement was less well - known			2
a left - arm seamer whose 43 - match first - class career produced an impressive 181 wickets at just 24 apiece for @entity43 sides @entity44 and @entity45 , as well as @entity46 , he is understood allegedly to have approached @entity4 to enlist his help in fixing the 40 - over game against @entity49 in august 2011			1
it was that match , as well as @entity46 ’s @entity52 game against @entity53 in the same month , that has formed the basis of the charges laid by the @entity3			1
in the game against @entity49 , @entity20 understands that it is suggested that @entity4 and @entity5 wore black sweatbands to indicate the fix was on			1
chasing 217 to win , @entity46 had raced to 76 without loss after 10 overs , and looked well on course for victory			2
@entity4 , who has revealed the full extent of his involvement with match - fixing to the @entity66 in what amounts to a plea bargain , came in at @entity69 and was run out for a single , made from seven balls			1
@entity5 , who had allegedly persuaded @entity4 to partake in the fix three days earlier during the drive north to @entity73 for a game against @entity75 , arrived in the middle at no 9 with @entity46 needing 74 off 13.4 overs			1
to the consternation of the @entity46 dressing - room , @entity5 made 11 off 29 balls — a major factor in @entity49 ’s eventual 14 - run victory			1
he had earlier taken no wicket for 41 runs in six overs			1
key role : @entity5 's slow batting and poor bowling played a large part in @entity46 's defeat the bookie said to have organised the fix , ‘ ng ’ , was reportedly at the match , and spoke to @entity4 on the boundary when he was fielding , having apparently grown nervous at the fast start made by the @entity46 openers			1
@entity94 and @entity4 had met each other , along with @entity5 , the previous night in a @entity101 hotel , where @entity4 had told ng he would take part in the fix			1
to collect his payment for helping throw the game — said to be £ 40,000 — @entity4 had to supply the serial code of a £ 20 note to another bookie , known as ‘ @entity108 ’ , who was in on the scam			2
@entity4 then met two men near @entity111 , and confirmed his identity by handing over the £ 20 note and undergoing a voice - recognition test			2
suspicion immediately focused on the match because of the huge amounts of money placed on the outcome — £ 14m , more than twice the normal figure for a televised county game			1
suspicious : eyebrows were raised when £ 14million was placed on the match on the community forum for the betting exchange @entity126 , there was a running commentary , with several posters apparently aware when wickets would fall			0
this became key evidence for the @entity3			0
in early 2012 , under @entity133 , the board ’s anti-corruption chief who had started six months earlier , players were interviewed , betting data was analysed and betting experts were canvassed			0
there had been dismay among the @entity3 anti-corruption team that the @entity24 had cleared the game			0
one source said : ‘ we could n’t understand it			0
it was obvious the game needed to be looked at			0
’ but the situation may have been complicated by the fact that , at the time , @entity4 told @entity46 he had been approached to fix the game — but had turned it down			1
with no names passed on to the @entity24 , the investigation went nowhere , until it emerged in 2012 that @entity4 had been interviewed about the game			0
dismay : the @entity3 anti-corruption team could not believe the @entity24 initially cleared the match the case was then reopened , leading to thursday ’s charges — though the @entity3 ’s anti-corruption officials were close to charging the players last spring			0
a conviction would be a major feather in the @entity3 ’s cap , especially in the light of accusations of ineffectiveness aimed at the @entity24 ’s own anti-corruption unit — accusations that the @entity24 chief executive @entity164 angrily denied			0
on thursday , the managing director of the @entity167 team @entity168 told @entity169 : ‘ it ’s an enormous concern — match - fixing is potentially a cancer for any sport			2
it is something the @entity3 takes extremely seriously			0
’ that last sentence is the kind of message cricket fans are longing to hear — and probably should have heard several years ago .			0
