bedtime reading has traditionally been thought to boost a child 's development - but in fact chatting while doing housework may be of greater benefit			1
this is according to @entity8 researchers who conducted a study on the impact of bedtime reading on 7,845 nine - month - old infants			1
they found that absent - minded conversation was four times better at improving a child 's communication skills than reading to them or showing them pictures			1
bedtime reading has traditionally been thought to boost a child 's development - but in fact chatting while doing housework ( stock image shown ) may be of greater benefit , according to a recent study by @entity25 in the study , 94 per cent of infants had a parent show them pictures ; 80 per cent of nine - month - olds were read to and 66 per cent of mothers reported always talking to their children			1
researchers at the @entity33 ( @entity34 ) found that as well as communication skills , chatting to children was three times better at improving problem solving skills			1
@entity39 , a lecturer in psychology at @entity25 's @entity41 , told @entity42 at the @entity43 that she was surprised by the results			1
' we would have thought that there might have been a good effect of reading , perhaps more so than the talking , ' she said			0
last year , a group of experts suggested that reading to children has such a huge impact on their academic success that parents should do it from birth scientists think that cooing at a newborn baby is a vital part of teaching them to speak			1
exaggerated vowels that experts call ‘ motherese ’ - the ‘ goos ’ and ‘ gaas ’ that can be infuriating to non-parents - are a key part of the learning process , a study by the @entity62 suggests			2
exposing infants to clear vocal sounds from birth helps them distinguish language from other noises , the researchers suggest			2
they found that babies aged seven months can differentiate voices from other sounds - even when they can not see the person speaking			2
by the age of 11 months , before they can speak themselves , the children have already learned to differentiate their mother tongue from other languages , the scientists discovered			0
the study serves as evidence that speaking to infants at a very early age is vital for their development			2
and the authors say the long , clear vowels that parents babble at their newborns is a key part of the process			0
she said that it was easier for many parents to talk to their children regularly than devote all their attention and time to reading a book			0
the researchers are now looking into longer - term impacts of reading and talking to children up to three years of age			1
last year , a group of experts suggested that reading to children has such a huge impact on their academic success that parents should do it from birth			0
the @entity114 ( @entity114 ) said in a policy statement that story time routines benefit even the youngest children , helping them to build vocabulary			0
experts say reading or storytelling in early life predicts how well children will do when they enter preschool			0
in previous recommendations , the @entity114 has discouraged parents from exposing children under the age of two years to tv , which can be detrimental to language development			0
a separate study by @entity132 in @entity133 warned that background noise from the tv can adversely affect toddlers ' language development			0
they say it has long been known children develop their language skills from listening to their parents - and parents speak to their children less when the tv is on			1
the quantity of words and phrases , as well as the number of new words spoken by the parents , was lower than when the tv was off .			0

this is according to an @entity8 study of 7,845 nine - month - old infants
the study also found that chatting to children while doing housework was three times better at improving their problem solving skills than reading
researchers at @entity25 say the results have surprised them
