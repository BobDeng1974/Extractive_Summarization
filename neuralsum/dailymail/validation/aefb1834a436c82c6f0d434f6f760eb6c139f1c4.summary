human rights campaigners have presented police with a ' dossier ' of new evidence against a @entity5 prince accused of torture after he revealed on social media he was staying in @entity9			1
prince @entity10 , 27 , accidentally let slip he was back in @entity11 on thursday when he posted a video of himself running in @entity13			1
the prince posted the video on @entity16 alongside a squadron of the @entity18 of the @entity19 with the caption : ' that 's how it feels and sounds when you run in @entity13 , @entity9			1
' prince @entity10 posted this video of himself running in @entity13 on thursday the video was captioned : ' that 's how it feels and sounds when you run in @entity13 , @entity9 ' he now faces fresh calls for his arrest following a @entity32 ruling last year which stripped him of diplomatic immunity			1
a @entity5 refugee in @entity11 , referred to only as @entity35 , alleged prince @entity10 was involved in the torture of detained prisoners during 2011 @entity40 protests			1
today @entity41 reported human rights lawyers acting for @entity35 have delivered a ' dossier ' of new evidence to @entity45 in a bid to have him charged following the revelation he is visiting the capital			1
previous allegations which gave rise to the diplomatic immunity row did not stick			0
no charges were brought against him due to a lack of evidence and both he and the government of @entity5 strongly deny the accusations			1
the case arose after @entity35 , who has been granted asylum in the @entity11 , claims he was badly beaten - though not by the prince directly - and given a prison sentence after taking part in protests in the @entity68 state in february 2011 which left dozens dead			2
following the decision to revoke his diplomatic immunity in october last year , a spokeswoman for the @entity71 said : ' as the @entity11 @entity75 has today affirmed , an arrest would have been improper given the absence of evidence of the conduct alleged			0
' as @entity5 has never sought anonymity or sovereign immunity from the @entity83 for anyone in respect of this case , it expresses no view on the @entity75 's statement that immunity was inappropriate			2
' this has been an ill - targeted , politically - motivated and opportunistic attempt to misuse the @entity11 legal system			0
the @entity71 again categorically denies the allegations against @entity10			0
' lawyers for prince @entity10 said : ' the allegations are entirely false and categorically denied by prince @entity10			2
the presentation of the " dossier " to the police appears to be a politically - motivated and opportunistic attempt to use the @entity11 justice system once again to ventilate damaging allegations about prince @entity10			1
' @entity35 stated last october that he intended to submit further evidence to the police , but some five months passed and nothing had been forthcoming until today			2
the timing of the actions of the campaigners suggests this is nothing more than a publicity stunt designed to coincide with prince @entity10 's visit to the @entity11 and @entity35 's lawyers ' threatening earlier this week to bring judicial review proceedings in respect of the @entity11 - @entity5 naval agreement			1
' the police have previously declined to investigate prince @entity10 on the basis of the insufficiency of the evidence against him			1
the submission of this new dossier at this time coincides with other attempts by opposition activists to exploit the @entity11 justice system to influence @entity11 - @entity5 relations			0
' prince @entity10 , born in may 1987 , is the fourth son of the @entity127 @entity126 and his second wife , @entity131 bint @entity129 of @entity132			1
he was educated in @entity5 at the @entity133 , before commissioning from royal @entity134 in august 2006 , two terms after prince @entity137			0
during his @entity138 , prince @entity10 was presented with the @entity139 , awarded to the overseas officer cadet considered to be the most improved recruit			2
he currently serves as commander of @entity5 's @entity143 and as president of the @entity145			2
@entity5 anti-government protesters wait at barriers they had set up for @entity149 forces called in to prop up the monarchy against demonstrations in 2011			0
the barrier in the foreground reads : ' down with @entity126 ' inspired by the @entity40 , protesters in @entity5 had initially wanted to achieve greater political freedom and equality for the @entity158 muslims who form the majority of the population , as opposed to the ruling @entity162 royal family			0
however , following an attack on protesters who had gathered at the @entity165 in @entity166 on february 17 , 2011 , demonstrators began to call for an end to @entity126 's rule			0
the following month 1,000 troops from @entity149 and 500 troops from @entity171 arrived in @entity5 to quell the protests , and on march 15 the king of @entity5 declared martial law and a three - month state of emergency			0
a man identified only as @entity35 was later granted refugee status in the @entity11 , and from there , set about trying to bring charges against prince @entity10			1
claiming the prince should be held responsible for his beating and imprisonment during the turmoil , his accusations were stopped when the prince was granted diplomatic immunity			0
in october last year , this was overturned , creating the possibility - albeit an unlikely one - that he could be charged when travelling outside @entity5			0
however , these charges collapsed due to a lack of evidence .			0
