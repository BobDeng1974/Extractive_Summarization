by @entity0 the ‘ @entity4 ’ is at stake in the general election a year today , @entity1 warned last night			2
with a poll showing @entity7 doing the @entity8 serious damage , the prime minister urged supporters to stick with the government ’s economic plans			1
otherwise , he said , the @entity13 would take charge and spend and borrow more			1
a poll has shown that @entity7 , under @entity16 , pictured , is damaging the @entity17 - with just a year to the general election @entity17 strategists accept that many of their supporters will back @entity7 as a protest in this month ’s @entity24 poll – and must be brought back into the fold before the general election			1
an analysis by @entity28 showed that 42 per cent of those who voted @entity17 in 2010 plan to back @entity7 in the @entity24 elections this month			1
of 9,000 people questioned by the polling group , almost 2,000 said they would vote for the @entity35 party if a general election were held now			2
@entity17 defectors outnumbered by three to two the @entity13 and @entity39 defectors together			1
@entity28 ’s @entity40 said : ‘ @entity16 should not claim that his party is winning votes from @entity13 on anything like the scale that it is taking them from the conservatives			1
’ a new @entity50 opinion poll for the @entity51 puts @entity13 just one point ahead of the @entity8 @entity13 , under @entity53 , pictured , have done ' little to allay the fear that they would spend more than the country can afford ' if they are triumphant at the next general election the prime minister has told his mps to brag about the success of policies aimed at women			1
at a private party meeting , @entity1 said the government had been ‘ underselling ’ its policies directed at helping women			2
since 2010 , the number of women on @entity71 company boards had increased to 20.7 per cent and the gender pay gap was ‘ almost eliminated for full - time workers under 40 ’ , women ’s minister @entity73 told @entity59			1
the number of women running small businesses had risen from 14 per cent to 20 per cent under the @entity78 , miss @entity75 added			1
yet despite the progress made , mr @entity1 told @entity59 and peers that ‘ we have been underselling this ourselves ’ in terms of women ’s policies			2
former @entity17 deputy chairman @entity84 , now a leading pollster , says mr @entity1 remains his party ’s ‘ biggest electoral asset ’ but time is running out to persuade voters that he and his colleagues are on their side			1
he argues that @entity7 is ‘ an ideal conduit for the blowing of mid-term raspberries ’ but those who want their vote to count in 2015 will have to choose between the main parties			1
mr @entity1 , who addressed mps and peers with his chief election strategist @entity100 last night , said : ‘ the general election is one year away			2
for each of those 365 days , the @entity17 have one clear message : we are the team that is turning @entity106 around			2
‘ we have set out a serious , long - term economic plan : reducing the deficit , cutting income taxes , backing business , capping welfare , reducing immigration , delivering the best schools and skills – and that plan is working for families across our country			1
’ he said the deficit had been cut by over a third , the economy was one of the fastest growing in the developed world and 1.5million more people were in work			0
he added : ‘ immigration is down			0
and something i ’m very proud of : today 250,000 fewer children are being taught in failing schools			0
all this means more peace of mind for families , more young people with the chance to get on in life , and more financial security			0
‘ from the ashes of the @entity139 we are building a great @entity106 revival			0
all this is at stake a year from now			0
@entity13 ’s only plans are for more spending , more borrowing , more debt – more of the same that got us into the mess			1
’ toward the end of the last parliament a cartoon showed a lady asking her husband : ‘ is it possible to be sick of an election before it ’s started ? ’ many will have the same thought long before we choose our next government , 365 days from @entity158 , though , the year will feel terrifyingly short			0
last night the @entity160 reassured his troops that they can take on @entity7 – the biggest worry for many in the party – by reminding voters that only the @entity17 can deliver a referendum and real change			1
lord @entity84 , pictured , believes it will take more than 12 months to change many voters view that the @entity8 are not on their side grumpy though some @entity8 are , they know @entity1 remains their biggest electoral asset			1
they also know there is no alternative ; as my polling has shown , @entity178 is popular but no silver @entity181 remains more popular than @entity53 and the @entity17 are more trusted than @entity13 to run the economy			1
the @entity8 hope these things will matter more to voters as the decision gets closer			2
meanwhile , jitters will grow if @entity13 ’s lead persists			1
it will take more than 12 months to change many voters ’ view that the @entity8 are not on their side			2
in the meantime , they must show more clearly what a national recovery could mean			0
my polling has found people are more likely to think a @entity17 government would benefit @entity106 than to believe it would be good for them			0
@entity199 will also feel the year rushing by			0
to most voters the @entity39 have betrayed their principles , or sunk without trace , or both			2
achieving office has also cost them the votes of the none - of - the - above brigade , probably for good			0
that means the @entity39 must define a national purpose for themselves			0
this – though @entity8 blame them for thwarting their most beloved schemes – is proving a struggle			0
they must hold on to as many as they can of the 57 seats they won in 2010 on perhaps half their former national vote share ; perhaps more than any other party , their fate lies in the marginals			0
@entity53 will be counting down the days more impatiently			0
@entity13 ’s current lead would see him comfortably into @entity219			1
but he knows governing parties tend to recover ground in the months before an election			0
he needs to show @entity13 have learned their lessons on the economy and that he has more to offer than complaints about how expensive everything is			1
@entity13 have done little to allay the fear that they would spend more than the country can afford and undo what progress the coalition has made on things like tackling benefit dependency			1
for @entity16 , too , may 7 , 2015 , can not come soon enough			0
for @entity7 , @entity24 elections bring attention by the truckload , but they have always marked the high points of success			1
though an ideal conduit for the blowing of mid-term raspberries , @entity16 will need to explain why @entity7 are worth voting for when more is at stake			1
stickers are already printed bearing the legend ‘ @entity244 , i voted @entity7 ’			1
fine , for those who want to opt out of the decision			0
but what to say to people who want their vote to count ? all the parties have to contend with public weariness and cynicism – not just about the behaviour of politicians but over whether politics itself can do much to change things			0
this threatens the established parties : in a world where governments seem to have so little power to solve problems and improve our lot , what does it matter who is in charge ? conservative supporters know @entity1 remains their ' biggest electoral asset ' and they also know there is no alternative			2
lord @entity84 's polling suggests that despite the popularity of @entity178 , pictured , he is ' no silver bullet '			1
how should the parties react to this attitude ? like this : show a bit of humility , keep things in proportion and treat the voters as grown - ups			2
do n’t overclaim , either about what you have done or what you can do			0
do n’t tell people you ’re going to change their world or that your opponents would shatter it			0
talk to people about the things they care about , rather than repeating what you hope they can be made to care about			0
for the voters , it is going to be a long year			2
the first thing they will need persuading of is that it matters who wins			0
