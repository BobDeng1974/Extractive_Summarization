' the judge said @entity0 had tried to bat off the allegations , telling police it was part of a ' witch - hunt ' against him			1

' this was a particularly vulnerable period in the company 's history prior to its collapse			0
' business partners @entity92 and @entity94 - who worked for the firms which made the loans - were sentenced to 18 months in prison each for helping @entity0 cover his tracks			1
all three must serve at least half their sentence			0
the suited trio all looked relaxed and stared straight ahead with passive expressions as the sentences were read out			0

the fraud focused on three large loans of several hundred thousand pounds which he received from suppliers , but failed to declare to the @entity1 board			2

@entity2 ( pictured above ) heard that @entity0 owed £ 11 million to @entity28 bank @entity122 and agreed he would provide it with documents about his loans and assets a third payment , again from @entity120 and @entity121 , was made to @entity0 later that year , this time of 250,000 @entity38 dollars ( about £ 134,000 )			1
@entity0 owed £ 11 million to @entity28 bank @entity122 , and agreed he would provide it with documents about his loans and assets			1

the group was founded in 1971 by @entity138 entrepreneur @entity137 , who sold it in 2007			0

@entity1 collapsed after restructuring attempts failed , leaving it with £ 150 million debts			0
a report filed by administrators at @entity151 shows sportswear group adidas was owed £ 10million , while @entity153 and @entity154 were each owed £ 8 million			2

@entity145 acquired control of 20 @entity1 stores when it bought the rump of the collapsed business			2
most of them have now been closed			0
the court heard that the fraud could have shaken the market 's trust in the company had it come to light at the time			2
prosecutor @entity175 said : ' one can not pin a fiscal health on a company which , by anyone 's point of view , was going through tough times			0
' but mr @entity0 was trusted and hailed as this new and brilliant leader			1
' self - made businessman @entity0 went from being able to raise £ 190 million on the market to fund his stake in @entity1 , to being a man ' broken financially ' , his defence lawyer , @entity184 , said			1
mr @entity186 said it had been a ' hellishly difficult year ' for @entity0 , who was left in financial straits following the economic crash			1
he said : ' he left school before he was 16 and by virtue of hard work and charisma he managed to build himself up to a position where he could borrow £ 190 million to buy the stake in the company			0
' and the crash caught him unawares as it caught others unaware			0
' @entity92 , 54 , and @entity94 , 52 , covered up emails relating to the loans and asked a computer engineer to wipe any trace of the emails , the court heard			2
but the engineer was so concerned that he contacted the @entity206			0
ms @entity207 said it was ' sheer fluke ' that he had the material and showed it to investigators			0
@entity0 , who did not give evidence in his own defence , was convicted of three counts of fraud , and two of furnishing false information			1

@entity228 , director of the @entity206 , said : ' these defendants contrived to hide information regarding their dealings from both @entity1 's board of directors and the @entity206 once its investigation began			0
' that the investigation resulted in these convictions , despite such attempts to derail it , reflects the @entity206 's determination in tackling complex and elaborate fraud			2
