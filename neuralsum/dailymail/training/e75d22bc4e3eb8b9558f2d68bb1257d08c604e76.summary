@entity0 , 43 , left , has been told that she must show her tumour is growing or else she will be denied the £ 4,500 - a - month life - prolonging drug , with husband @entity4 , and sons @entity6 , 8 , and @entity7 , 11 , right desperate cancer patients have been put in the ‘ bizarre ’ position of hoping their conditions deteriorate so they can get a drug that will soon be withdrawn from the @entity12			1
a type of life - prolonging pill called regorafenib is to be denied to patients from later this month to save money – but sufferers who have already started the £ 4,500 - a-month treatment before then will be allowed to stay on it			1
mother - of - two @entity0 , 43 , is one of the patients who must show her tumours are growing before march 12 if she is to be eligible for the drug			1
she said : ‘ the drug i ’m on at the moment allows me to lead a near - normal life			1
but it could stop working any day now			0
’ her current medication , sunitinib , has been stalling the tumour ’s growth , but cancer usually develops resistance to the drug over time , requiring a different prescription			1
mrs @entity0 ’s doctor told her she has to ‘ fail ’ on her current drug before the cut - off date if she is to qualify for regorafenib			1
speaking from her home in @entity43 , @entity44 , she said : ‘ it feels terrible			0
if my tumours are growing , i will say to my consultant , “ let ’s quickly apply for regorafenib			2
” it ’s a bizarre situation			0
’ @entity51 is one of 16 drugs being cut from the list of medicines available from @entity56 ’s £ 280 million @entity57 for all but the most exceptional circumstances			2
the radical cost - cutting drive will affect thousands of patients with advanced cancer across @entity62			1
mrs @entity0 , who holds down a full - time job with the @entity64 , suffers from a rare type of cancer known as ‘ gist ’ – gastrointestinal stromal tumour			1
but the change will also hit those with breast , bowel and prostate cancer , as well as leukaemia and lymphoma			2
studies show regorafenib could double average survival times , from about nine to 17 months			2
some patients live far longer			0
another @entity67 patient in the same situation is @entity82 , a 27 - year - old phd meteorology student , who also fears he is starting to become resistant to sunitinib			2
mr @entity82 , from @entity84 in @entity85 , said : ‘ if sunitinib works less effectively for me , the next – and indeed only – treatment remaining is regorafenib			0
to find this will no longer be available through the @entity57 is highly stressful			0
‘ living with this disease is worrying enough without having this added stress that regorafenib , which is proven to be successful for @entity67 treatment , will no longer be available			0
’ his girlfriend @entity93 , 28 , added : ‘ the government seems to view people like @entity82 as dispensable			0
if his cancer starts growing after march 12 , the fact that they are removing this drug will be a death sentence			1
’ the cuts are being made because the @entity57 has become a victim of its own success			0
set up in 2010 with a £ 200 million - a-year budget , about 60,000 patients have benefited so far			1
but it overspent its budget by £ 30 million last year – in part because or more applications – but also , say critics , because it has allowed drugs firms to keep charging sky - high prices			1
its budget has been raised to £ 280 million for this financial year and will be raised again to £ 340 million in april			0
professor @entity116 , chairman of the @entity57 , said : ‘ these are difficult decisions , but if we do n’t prioritise the drugs that offer the best value , many people could miss out on promising , more effective treatments that are in the pipeline			0
’ the cuts are being made because the @entity57 is so successful and costing more than expected			0

@entity0 has been told she must show her cancer is growing
otherwise she will be denied a £ 4,500 - a - month life - prolonging drug
if she misses the march 12 *deadline* , she will be stuck on an *inferior* drug
