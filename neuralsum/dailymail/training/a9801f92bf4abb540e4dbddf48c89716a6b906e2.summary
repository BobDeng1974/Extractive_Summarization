@entity0 stole the show as @entity2 beat @entity3 2 - 1 at @entity4 but both teams ' playmakers also left their mark on the game			1
@entity9 spoke before the north @entity11 derby about a desire for his team to play with lucidity			0
while most of his players struggled to achieve this , for one player on the @entity4 pitch the machinations of the game seemed clear			2
@entity19 has started three games since returning from injury , in all three he played on the left , in all three he scored			1
@entity19 watches as his volley beats @entity24 to find the back of the net early in the first half the @entity29 - winner wheels away in celebration after giving @entity3 the lead @entity32 battles with @entity33 and @entity34 during the north @entity11 derby while the in - form @entity39 failed to have a significant impact on the game , his @entity37 team - mate wasted no time influencing the match			1
with 11 minutes gone , @entity34 crossed for @entity44 , the @entity43 scuffed his shot but @entity19 had lost @entity46 at the back post and calmly volleyed into the back of the net			2
to suggest @entity19 had anticipated his team - mate 's mistake would be a hard sell but that should n't detract from his opener			2
one of his strengths is his ability to find space - whether he 's playing in the centre or on the left - and it was that ability that earned him the goal			0
but from there on @entity3 retreated and it was his opposite number that took control			0
@entity2 's @entity64 playmaker is tackled by @entity3 midfielder @entity65 @entity3 playmaker @entity19 's heat map from @entity68 's @entity67 @entity2 playmaker @entity32 's heat map from @entity68 's @entity67 feature @entity32 @entity19 @entity32 - who arrived just in north @entity11 just two days before @entity19 in 2013 - has enjoyed , statistically , a more impressive season so far			1
and while the former @entity73 man failed to add to his tally of 11 goals for the season , he played a crucial role as @entity2 dominated possession			1
he spent most of the first half on the left attempting to exploit weaknesses in full back @entity33 's game			0
his presence caused problems for the @entity86 graduate but @entity2 ended the half trailing			0
the second half was a different story			0
spurs dominated from the off , and @entity32 played a huge part in that			1
his passing may not have possessed its normal accuracy but @entity32 but he covered a huge amount of ground throughout the game , and only one offensive midfielder or forward won more duels than him during the match			2
@entity32 ( 48 ) made almost double the amount of passes as @entity19 ( 25 ) during the clash , won more duels , and made more recoveries			1
the @entity3 man was , though , more clinical			0
he scored with his only shot of the game and had superior pass accuracy throughout			0
former @entity111 midfielder @entity19 protects the ball from @entity114 @entity113 @entity32 played a crucial role in helping @entity2 dominate possession at @entity4 the opening goal of the game , scored by @entity19 , as depicted by @entity68 's @entity67 feature			1

@entity3 lost 2 - 1 to @entity2 drew at @entity4
@entity19 scored the opening goal of the game at @entity4
@entity0 scored a brace to turn the game on its head
@entity32 played a *key* role in @entity2 ' dominance
