just a stepping stone ... a woman models @entity1 , which is being trialled across the @entity4 @entity3 hopes one day to use microchips in users ' brains online advertising giant @entity3 's new wearable accessories are merely a stepping stone to its ultimate ambition - a microchip which can be embedded in users ' brains			1
the company , which uses its search , email and other services to funnel personalised advertising to users , is currently trialling prototypes of its @entity1 device , which is worn like a pair of glasses			2
but @entity3 is staking its future on a new service which will use the information it holds on registered users to automatically predict their search needs and present them with the data they want			1
the ultimate ambition is to literally get inside users ' heads : using search queries to read their thoughts and then fulfilling their data needs by sending results directly to microchips implanted into people 's brains			1
@entity42 , @entity3 's vice-president of @entity43 told @entity44 that the sinister - sounding vision is far from a sci - fi fantasy and that research had already begun with such chips to help disabled people steer their wheelchairs			2
' they are getting a few senses of direction with the wheelchair but getting from there to actual words is a long ways off , ' he said			0
' we have to do this in the brain a lot better to make that interaction possible			0
we have impatience for that to happen but the pieces of technology have to develop			0
' but standing in the way of this ambition is a major civil liberties backlash over claims that @entity3 has conspired with @entity4 authorities to open a ' back door ' to data it holds on its hundreds of millions of users , allowing spies to monitor their online activities			1
the company , whose ' do n't be evil ' motto has long attracted derision from privacy campaigners , is alleged to have allowed analysts from the @entity84 to ' mine ' the terabytes of personal information it holds			1
in the so - called @entity89 programme , revealed last month in a series of articles in @entity92 , @entity3 and a host of other @entity95 firms are alleged to have colluded with the @entity4 domestic intelligence agency			1
as well as @entity3 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , and @entity103 are alleged to have allowed agents access to their data to conduct surveillance on users without court orders			1
tainted by scandal : @entity3 faces a civil liberties backlash over claims that it and other internet firms have conspired with @entity4 authorities to give spies a ' back door ' to data it holds on its hundreds of millions of users web - users who want to protect their privacy have been switching to a small unheard of search engine in the wake of the ' @entity89 ' revelations			1
@entity124 , the little known @entity4 company , sets itself aside from its giant competitors such as @entity3 and @entity103 , by not sharing any of its clients ' data with searched websites			1
this means no targeted advertising and no skewed search results			2
aside from the reduced ads , this unbiased and private approach to using the internet is appealing to users angered at the news that @entity4 and @entity139 governments ( the @entity84 ( @entity84 ) in the @entity4 and @entity140 in the @entity139 ) , have direct access to the servers of big search engine companies , allowing them to ' watch ' users			2
within just two weeks of the @entity84 's operations being leaked by former employee @entity146 , @entity124 's traffic had doubled - from serving @entity148 searches a day , to 3million			0
' we started seeing an increase right when the story broke , before we were covered in the press , ' said @entity153 , founder and ceo , speaking to @entity92			0
although strenuously denied by @entity3 , the accusations contained in leaks by whistleblower @entity146 have provoked a crisis of trust in the company , as web users look for ways to surf the internet without being tracked			2
nevertheless , @entity3 sees its future in leveraging the the wealth of information it holds on its users to present them with ever more personalised services			1
glass is merely a part of the company 's wider information ecosystem , which it intends to exploit with a new service called @entity173 , which will present users with a series of bespoke ' cards ' as they log on			2
they will tell users the local weather , any problems they might face on their commute to work , details of meetings harvested from their @entity187 accounts , their favourite sports teams latest results , and so on			0
the service is based on what @entity3 calls its @entity191 , a vast store of information which , @entity44 reports , is growing at an ' exponential rate '			0
just a year after the project 's launch , @entity191 is said to hold 18billion facts on around 570million subjects			0
the next step , mr @entity42 explained , is for this knowledge to be ' present everywhere '			0
@entity201 , @entity3 's engineering director , continued the explanation			0
' fast forward a bit and â€¦ i think there is going to be a device in the ceiling with microphones , and it will be in my glasses or my wristwatch or my shirt , ' he said .			0

@entity3 faces major backlash over claims it colluded with @entity4 authorities to open a ' back door ' to users ' personal information
but it nevertheless intends to leverage the wealth of data it holds on people to offer them increasingly personalised search results
the ultimate ambition is to get inside users ' heads with microchips that will *download* search results straight into their brains
