@entity1 's most famous locomotive is celebrating its 80th anniversary since becoming the first ever train to travel at over 100mph			1
a stunning set of pictures of the @entity6 have now been released to mark its world record breaking journey on november 30 , 1934 , as it travelled between @entity8 and @entity9			1
the @entity10 and @entity11 , @entity12 , locomotive 's speed hit triple digits on the downwards slope of @entity17 near @entity18 , when it officially became the fastest train in the world			1
sir @entity40 had designed the steam train after the @entity12 asked him to help them find a new way to take passengers from the capital to @entity45 in four hours instead of buying a @entity48 diesel - powered ' @entity46 '			2
built in @entity50 in 1923 , the locomotive was named the ' @entity6 ' after the @entity9 to @entity8 rail service which had been running since 1862 , and was the first train to complete the 392 - mile route non-stop on may 1 , 1928			2
built in @entity50 in 1923 , the locomotive was named the ' @entity6 ' after the @entity9 to @entity8 rail service which had been running since 1862 the locomotive was the first train to reach 100mph and also the first to complete the 392 - mile @entity9 to @entity8 route non-stop on may 1 , 1928 arguably the world 's most famous train , the @entity6 has been restored and studied extensively , as can be seen here where scientific research is carried out onboard in 1931 since then it has had various owners including record producer @entity62 , and has toured the @entity63 and @entity64 where it set its second world record , for the longest non-stop run by a steam locomotive			1
the @entity6 made a special charter journey in 2005 also captured in the pictures before being moved to the @entity70 in @entity71 for complete restoration			0
@entity73 , director of the @entity70 , said : ' we are now progressing full steam ahead towards completing the restoration			0
' we are showcasing @entity1 engineering genius , with our @entity77 at @entity78 ; the @entity70 at @entity79 next month so it 's great that we can announce good news regarding another @entity40 - designed icon			0
it served for 39 years before being decommissioned from scheduled service in 1963 after it had clocked up more than two million miles			0
the @entity70 have released the incredible collection of photographs to mark 80 years since its record breaking journey in a daring feat , a plane flies perilously close as plane passengers talk to railway passengers on the @entity6 , while both travel 90mph in march 1932 the locomotive , pictured here in 2005 , has changed hands on a number of occasions since being decommissioned by @entity98 , including record producer @entity62 the flagship locomotive had its first taste of fame at the @entity102 in 1924 before it was selected for the prestigious @entity9 to @entity8 service			1
when @entity98 decided to scrap the train in in 1963 , a campaign group called ' @entity106 ' attempted to raise the money to buy the @entity6			0
the group failed and it was instead bought by railway preservationist @entity109 who restored it to 1930s condition , before he famously took it on a tour of the @entity63 , supported by prime minister @entity114 , for which it was fitted with a bell , headlamp and cowcatcher			0
when @entity109 was hit by financial issues , @entity1 businessman @entity120 bought the @entity6 and toured @entity64 between 1988 - 9 it , where the train broke its second world record , for the longest ever non-stop run by a steam locomotive , when it ran 422 miles ( 679 km ) on 8 august 1989			1
the locomotive was to change hands several times again but in 2004 , following a successful campaign , @entity6 was returned to public ownership when it was purchased by the @entity132			0
as part of ongoing restorations , it was moved to @entity135 last year and engineers working on the locomotive hope it will be ready for action on modern @entity1 train tracks in summer 2015			2
following a successful campaign , @entity6 was returned to public ownership in 2004 when it was purchased by the @entity132 ongoing restoration work is currently taking place on the locomotive which will be ready for action on modern @entity1 train tracks in summer 2015			2

the famous locomotive broke the record to become the world 's fastest locomotive on november 30 , 1934
it had been travelling between @entity8 and @entity9 when its speed was recorded at 100mph
the train was driven by @entity26 , 61 , who is featured in the stunning set of photographs
it later went onto to break another record in @entity64 for longest *distance* run by a steam train
