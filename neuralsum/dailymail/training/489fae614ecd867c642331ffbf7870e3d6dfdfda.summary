they are two giants of the animal kingdom , but that did not stop this male elephant and black rhino from clashing dramatically in a fearsome fight at a park in @entity6			1
amateur photographer @entity7 and his wife @entity8 captured these extraordinary photographs of the large elephant attacking the female rhino - flipping it into its back and leaving it with its legs in the air			1
the couple from @entity20 , @entity6 , were photographing a rhino cow and her calf when the testosterone - fuelled , one - tusked elephant approached			2
mr @entity7 said : ' male elephants on musth , fuelled by exorbitant levels of testosterone , are extremely dangerous , and will attack anything which stands in their path			2
' @entity58 is a condition during which bull elephants experience a huge rise in reproductive hormones - testosterone levels can reach up to 60 times higher than normal - and this makes them extremely aggressive			0
stunned : amateur photographer @entity7 and his wife @entity8 did not expect the fight to break out immobilised : the helpless rhino is left prostrate , lying on its back after the elephant 's brutal attack cowering : the rhino calf watches on , hiding in the shrubs as the elephant attacks its mother baby blues : the calf emerges in search of its mother as the elephant peers on it the background ' the elephant immediately toppled the rhino which landed helplessly on its back with its legs in the air , ' mr @entity7 continued			1
' the elephant kept rolling the defenceless rhino around in the dust , while crushing it repeatedly under its enormous weight - in a traumatising display of speed , agility and brutal power			2
' after the fight the rhino 's calf rushed to its injured mother 's side			0
' the calf remained in the vicinity for some time , circling her mother and attempting repeatedly to help her up , ' mr @entity7 said			0
i love you mum ! the baby rhino rushes to its mother 's side once the scene is safe and the elephant has gone caring child : the calf tends to its mother , which lies on the ground , groaning in pain from her injuries heartbreaking : the mother managed to get up after around two hours , but died days later from her injuries scientific name : @entity117 height : 11 feet length : 19 - 24 feet weight : 6 tons status : vulnerable habitats : grasslands and forests scientific name : @entity126 height : 5.2 feet length : 10 feet weight : 1,760 - 3,080lb status : critically endangered habitats : grasslands and deserts the pair reported the incident to the management of the park , who said that the rhino did miraculously manage to get up around two hours after the attack			1
the following day she was spotted about 300 metres from the scene of the fight , but unfortunately died a few days later from her injuries			0
the couple were requested not to identify the park to prevent the influx of poachers into the area .			0
