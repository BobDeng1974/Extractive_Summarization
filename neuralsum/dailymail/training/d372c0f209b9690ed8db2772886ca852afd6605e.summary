@entity1 , 18 , was at the wheel of the ' high powered ' @entity13 saloon and doing nearly double the 30mph speed limit when he hit a @entity15 emerging from a side street			1
the @entity15 driver , @entity18 , 32 , from @entity19 , and his sister , front - seat passenger @entity21 , 37 , from @entity23 , @entity24 , were both killed			1
moments earlier , the defendant had been ' jockeying ' and ' playing games ' with a friend in a @entity28 along a nearby dual carriageway			2
following the crash , @entity1 got out of his car and tried to help the injured , waving his arms and saying : ' what have i done ? ' the defendant , who is also the captain of the @entity37 under - 18 side and played 17 times for his country , will serve half his sentence - eight months - in custody but may be released earlier on an electronic tag			1
he was also ordered to sell his luxury car so the money could go to mrs @entity45 's two orphaned children			2
mr @entity18 's widow sat in the public gallery , with an interpreter relaying the proceedings , and wiped away tears during the hearing			1
the crash victims came to the @entity54 in 2001 to start a new life after fleeing persecution by the @entity57 , the court heard			2
ms @entity45 's two sons , aged 16 and 17 , both back - seat passengers , were injured in the crash , which happened in central @entity24 at about 10.15pm on september 1 last year			1
they are now orphans after their father was killed in @entity61			1
@entity1 had one previous conviction for speeding - again doing 56mph in a 30mph zone			1
dressed in a dark suit and overcoat , @entity1 was in tears as he went into the dock , before the judge entered the room , and wept throughout the proceedings and as he was jailed			1
@entity1 , of @entity72 , @entity24 , admitted two counts of causing death by careless driving at the city ’s magistrates ’ court earlier this month			1
@entity1 got into his car and mr @entity94 drove off in his @entity28 with mr @entity93 as passenger			1
as the cars got to @entity105 in central @entity24 another driver @entity103 , saw them ' jockeying ' , the court heard , with the cars accelerating hard then slowing down			2
' they were constantly accelerating and slowing , with the rear of the @entity6 dipping down and smoke coming from the exhaust as diesels do , ' mr @entity103 told police			2
' they were playing games , not racing and were not excessively fast			2
' @entity114 , a passenger in mr @entity103 ’s car , saw the @entity6 swerve before it hit the @entity15			0
mr @entity89 said : ' her response to the collision was , " that ’s what happens when you mess around on roads			0
” ’ @entity1 got out of his car and tried to help the injured , waving his arms saying , " what have i done ! " mr @entity18 and his sister ms @entity45 were pronounced dead at the scene			1
career ruined : @entity127 can be seen here playing for the @entity2 youth team her son @entity130 , was unconscious but her other son @entity132 was conscious , crying and asking for his mother , the court heard			0
police initially investigated whether @entity135 from @entity72 , @entity24 was racing a friend in a @entity28 as both cars appeared to be accelerating and slowing down apparently to avoid speed cameras			1
but they later ruled out the racing line of inquiry and freed the other driver without charge			0
today the £ 1,000 a week defender who has been at @entity2 since 2003 and has represented @entity37 at under - 17 level broke and wept as was given 16 months jail and banned from driving for three years			1
after the case @entity148 , from @entity149 said : ' what this case tragically highlights is that every time someone gets behind the wheel of a car , the driver has to have 100 percent concentration , they must adhere to the speed limits and respect the laws of the road			1
' there can be absolutely no room for risks or " showboating "			0
a car can be a lethal weapon and sadly that has been borne out and taken @entity166 and @entity21 away from their loving family forever			1
' no family should have to suffer such a devastating loss in these circumstances			0
i can only hope now the case has concluded that they can try and move forward with their lives			0
' at the time mr @entity18 's was driving his sister and her children home from a @entity179 temple and was due to return to collect his wife and their two children , aged one and three			1
his lawyer @entity185 said in mitigation : ' it has to be said that this type of case should always be called tragic			0
tragic for the family that lost their loved ones and also tragic for the defendant			0
' he became involved in a matter that only took a few seconds but it will remain with him for the rest of his life			0
he is truly sorry for his actions			0
he was sorry when he was at the scene and he said ' what have i done ? ' staying at the scene for over an hour trying to help anyway he could			0
convicted : this image was taken after @entity135 had passed his driving test ' we heard about him jostling for position			1
it was childish behaviour but it was n't dangerous			0
it was being carried out because the defendant 's mobile phone lost charge and he was giving directions to the other driver , shouting instructions of where to go			0
' but even though it was that childish behaviour there was a period of time - 10 - 15 seconds at most - where he moved from being a child to being adult quickly			1
' he assisted at the scene			0
he has shown personal remorse - it is genuine			2
he is a young man who certainly had a promising football career			0
" he played for the under 18s international matches and he had played for @entity37 17 times			1
he was captain for the under 18s side			1
he had a promising future at @entity2			0
' he is a young man that wishes he could have those 10 seconds back but he ca n't			0
he 's faced up to the matter by accepting his responsibilities			0
' locked up : @entity1 , left , was the captain of the @entity37 under - 18 side and played 17 times for his country passing sentence judge @entity238 said : ' there are a number of aggravating factors - two deaths and serious injuries to the children and the defendant was speeding earlier			1
' he had been seen jockeying and that activity in my judgement says that the speeding was not an isolated act			0
' outside court @entity45 , @entity252 's wife , said : ' the driver has taken away my loving husband and father to my two children			0
our life has been destroyed			0
' @entity252 was more than anything i have ever loved in my life , nothing can replace him			0
i am pleased that justice has been done and i hope that this will teach him so no family has to go through what myself and my family have been through this past few months , and will continue to go through for the rest of our lives			2
' @entity271 , brother to both @entity166 and @entity21 , also said : ' not only has this incident taken away two loved members of our family - it has also affected in such a big way the people left behind			1
' our lives had begun to improve and we were looking forward to a brighter future , now all that has been taken from us			0
nothing will bring back our brother and sister and any sentence given by the courts will make our lives any better			2
' people who kill on the roads should be banned from driving forever so that they can never do this again to another person			2
' we are reminded daily about the loss of our brother and sister , he should be reminded every day too by not having the luxury of having the use of a car			2
