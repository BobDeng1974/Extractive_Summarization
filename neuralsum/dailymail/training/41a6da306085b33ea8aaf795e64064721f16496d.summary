former @entity1 gov. @entity0 on tuesday criticized president @entity3 's initial handling of the @entity5 crisis as ' incompetent , ' saying it gave rise to unneeded fears among the @entity10 public about the virus			1
@entity0 , who is the latest potential @entity12 presidential candidate to attack the president over @entity5 , also said in a wide - ranging discussion at @entity15 that he supports travel restrictions for people who have been to the most severely affected countries in @entity19			2
@entity0 said @entity3 should have been more ' clear and concise ' about his plans , and lent more credibility to health officials leading the response			1
@entity0 spoke at the @entity24 in @entity25 on monday			2
he slammed @entity3 's handling of @entity5 a day later , in what sounded like a campaign message trial balloon @entity30 to @entity31 : @entity0 seemed to support fellow @entity12 @entity37 ( left ) , the @entity33 governor who instituted an ebola quarantine policy beyond what @entity3 's @entity35 said was prudent ' it looked very incompetent to begin with , and that fueled fears that may not be justified , ' @entity0 said			1
' and now you have states that are legitimately acting on their concerns , creating a lot more confusion than is necessary			1
' @entity3 has tried to place his own imprint on the government 's response , making sure photographers captured images of him meeting with the ebola team and embracing @entity53 , one of the @entity55 nurses who recovered after contracting the disease			1
on tuesday he called @entity10 workers in @entity19 and delivered a statement from the @entity59 before leaving on a campaign trip to @entity61			0
@entity0 contrasted what he characterized as the president 's indecisive approach on @entity5 to his own actions as governor when anthrax was mailed to a supermarket tabloid in @entity1 after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001			1
' we gave people a sense of calm , what the plan was , ' @entity0 said			0
' we talked in plainspoken @entity76			0
' @entity0 also criticized @entity3 's foreign policy as lacking clear ' guiding principles , ' which he said has created a power vacuum that has been filled by the @entity80 in @entity81 and @entity82			1
time for choosing ? fifty years after an history @entity84 speech kicked off the modern conservative movement , @entity0 inched closer to a presidential run ' it 's been an unmitigated disaster in that regard , ' @entity0 said			1
' and he now is paying the price			0
' @entity0 concluded the talk by saying that he would wait until the end of the year before consulting with his family about whether to make a run for president			2
' if it 's a yes , i guess you go in the @entity100 , ' he said			0
' you try to acquire some superhuman skills , which i definitely will need , because i 'm imperfect in every way			0
' but @entity0 said he was n't overly consumed by the heavy speculation about whether he would seek to follow his father and brother to the @entity106			2
' i 'm totally blessed , ' he said			0
' so i 'm not like really freaking out about this decision			0

former @entity1 governor is *rumored* to be a 2016 presidential *contender* and the @entity111 to take the presidential *plunge*
he said @entity3 's ebola response ' looked very incompetent to begin with , and that fueled fears that may not be justified '
seemed to side with gov. @entity37 in the *battle* over *mandatory* quarantines , saying some states ' are legitimately acting on their concerns '
@entity0 says he 's ' not like really freaking out about this decision ' of whether to run for the @entity106
