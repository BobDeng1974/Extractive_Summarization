despite protestations of public loyalty from senior @entity3 figures , behind the scenes even shadow cabinet members who still believe in @entity6 are pressing for a change in style and direction			1
they know @entity6 neither looks nor sounds the part of the @entity12 , let alone prime minister - in - waiting			1
with six months to the election , there is pressure from those shadow ministers for senior mps and trade union leaders to see @entity6 in private and persuade him to make way for a caretaker leader like @entity22 , former home secretary , because there is no mechanism to force a leadership ballot so close to an election			1
' we had nothing to say in the @entity46 by - election on immigration , which was a big issue			2
’ it ’s hardly surprising @entity50 had no ammunition on immigration			0
@entity6 ‘ forgot ’ to mention it in his conference speech – along with the deficit			1
his close - knit kitchen cabinet of aides and advisers are still in denial about the extent of the @entity41 threat			0
utterly sycophantic , they often greet him with applause even after a badly received speech , and there are plenty of those			0
huddled in their bunker , they are as out of touch with @entity50 as @entity6 is with voters in the party ’s heartlands			2
bizarrely , he has viewed the rise of @entity41 solely as a problem for the @entity43 , even though @entity78 ’s party have come second to @entity3 in five by - elections in this parliament			0
there is pressure for @entity6 to hand caretaker leadership to the likes of former home secretary @entity22 @entity85 and @entity46 was only 148th on @entity41 ’s list of targets			1
in his conference speech , @entity6 made only one reference to @entity78 ’s party by mocking @entity90 for caring more about @entity41 than the @entity91			2
but the joke is now on him			0
confidence is draining from @entity6			2
he sounded tetchy and rattled in interviews yesterday and looked tired			0
he is braced for a difficult weekend with more mps making public attacks			2
the problem is that in a party once synonymous with flat caps and coal miners , one in four @entity50 used to work at @entity101 , with no experience of the real world			0
one shadow cabinet member who defended @entity6 on the radio was overheard saying afterwards : ‘ i have been trying for so long to get @entity6 ’s team to do something about our core voters to stop @entity41 , but it ’s not getting through			1
’ @entity6 is losing authority over his shadow cabinet			1
the @entity113 reported yesterday that he wanted to cut university tuition fees to £ 6,000			0
but the magazine was briefed that @entity6 had been blocked from making the change by shadow cabinet members			1
earlier , shadow chancellor @entity118 said it was a ‘ mistake ’ for @entity6 to omit the deficit in his conference speech			1
the truth is @entity6 is now a lame duck leader , a prisoner of his shadow cabinet and the trade unions			1
labour mps panicking about their seats have only got themselves to blame for not doing anything about him when they had the chance			0
it ’s too late to get rid of him now – unless the big beasts of the party make him an offer he ca n’t refuse .			0

ministers pledge @entity6 loyalty in public in private it is a different story
even shadow ministers are said to be calling for him to step aside
some *favour* handing *temporary* leadership to *veteran* @entity22
