by @entity0 a group of @entity3 and @entity4 parents are in revolt after they were told their children would have to attend a @entity8 school that bans meat and offers regular meditation and yoga			1
a shortage of places in @entity14 , east @entity15 , has led to more than 20 children being placed in @entity17			1
but 11 sets of parents have declined the places , leaving their children , aged four and five , with nowhere to go this september			1
row : @entity3 and @entity4 parents are angry their children have been offered places at @entity17 , a @entity21 school that insists on vegetarian meals , yoga and meditation @entity25 , of @entity14 , was ' not comfortable ' with the school 's ' strict no meat policy ' and practice of yoga and meditation , so she turned down her child 's place			1
she added : ' culturally it 's quite different and even though we do n't want to shelter our son we feel it would be difficult for him to be in that environment where it 's quite different from what we believe			0
' @entity4 mother @entity39 , also from @entity14 , told the @entity40 she was outraged that her four - year - old daughter had been refused a place at all six of her chosen schools			2
she said : ' i did n't want her to go to a @entity8 school so i am surprised the council would think i would accept a faith school which i did n't even apply for			0
' another parent , who asked not to be named , said : ' tolerance of other faiths and ways of life should be taught in schools			0
i 'm just taking exception with the fact they want to restrict my child 's diet			0
' i 'd demand to put what i want in packed lunches , but in winter who wants a sandwich ? i want my child to have a hot , meaty dinner			1
' delicious : this weekly menu from the school shows what its typical lunches consist of , but parents are unhappy about the restrictions on diet because it is completely vegetarian a @entity75 spokesman said : ' on the few occasions where it is not possible to offer one of the preferred schools , local authorities are required to offer an alternative place , which is usually based on the geographical proximity to the child 's address			2
' this will include any faith schools that have not been filled at allocation			0
' children aged four to 11 at the school are taught the standard curriculum , as well as many specialist @entity8 faith - based classes , including @entity94 and yoga			2
the school website states : ' character formation will be achieved through provision of classes in yoga and meditation , and a vegetarian diet that is healthy and freshly cooked			0

11 parents said no to their children attending @entity17
