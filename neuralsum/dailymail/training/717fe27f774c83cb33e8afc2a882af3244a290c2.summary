by @entity0 published : 16:40 est , 28 august 2013 updated : 02:12 est , 29 august 2013 when the @entity2 proudly released their first family photos - with the snugly wrapped @entity4 cradled in his mother 's arms - the nation breathed a collective ' awww '			0
swaddled in a simple shawl , the youngest member of the @entity10 was , we all agreed , what a newborn baby should look like			1
after all , the image of the @entity16 and swaddled baby @entity17 is one we 've grown up to recognise as the embodiment of motherhood			1
well , not any more			0
last week , grandmother @entity20 inadvertently dragged the new prince and his devoted mother into a debate on the wrongs and rights of swaddling by writing an angry letter to a newspaper about an incident involving her four - week - old grandson , also called @entity4			1
good enough for royalty : @entity4 of @entity33 was seen wrapped in a swaddling shawl in his first official pictures @entity20 wrote that her daughter had taken @entity4 to her local clinic where she was ' sternly told off ' for swaddling her child			1
what 's more , she now has a note on her file saying that by swaddling , she ' is willing to put her baby 's life at risk '			1
in short , she has been marked down as a bad parent			0
swaddling involves wrapping a newborn in a thin cotton sheet or blanket , so its arms are pinned against its body by the fabric , which is then secured under the child 's body			1
many mums hail it as an easy way to settle very young babies as it makes them feel warm and safe			1
as a bonus , by restricting the movement of the arms , swaddling suppresses the ' startle reflex ' , where babies suddenly - and often - throw out their arms in their sleep , waking themselves in the process			1
encouraging the trend : @entity4 was also seen in the swaddling blanket when he left hospital with his parents and other new mothers and fathers have been following suit not too tight : @entity4 had the blanket loosely wrapped around him on his first day out @entity75 is n't advised for babies once they 're capable of rolling over , as the cloth can end up over their face , increasing the risk of suffocation and cot death - but many mothers still swear by it up to the age of around four months			1
does any of this sound like poor parenting ? it certainly does n't to me			0
i swaddled my children - both my daughter , who is now 17 years old , and my son , who is six - and i swear i got more sleep as a result			0
however , there 's an increasing body of opinion calling for an end to it , pointing to the danger of the baby overheating , and suggesting the practice could even damage their joints			1
a 2009 study carried out by the universities of @entity106 and @entity107 indicated an increased risk of cot death in babies who were swaddled			1
' if your baby does n't like it , then do n't force it			1
@entity75 has to be baby - led ' of the group of infants in the study who succumbed to cot death between 2003 and 2006 , 24 per cent were swaddled , compared with 6 per cent in a control group of healthy babies			1
however , other factors , such as sleeping in the parents ' bed or on a sofa , or being in poor health , may also explain the results			0
the fear is that swaddling can send a baby 's temperature spiralling out of control			1
@entity133 , of the @entity134 , says : ' a newborn is unable to regulate its own body temperature in the way an adult can			1
that 's why the current advice for mothers is not to wrap their babies tightly or in heavy blankets , especially in warm weather			2
and a blanket should never be added to a swaddled baby			2
' professor @entity148 , a consultant orthopaedic surgeon at @entity149 , is firmly in the anti-swaddle camp			0
he says : ' we saw a huge resurgence in swaddling in 2011 , generated by the suggestion it could ease colic ( a condition where very young babies cry uncontrollably for no apparent reason ) , though i ’ve seen no evidence to support this			2
' that spike in popularity linked directly to an increase in the number of babies i saw with hip dysplasia - where the bones of the hip joint are not aligned correctly			2
parenting debate : swaddled newborns tend to sleep better but some believe it is n't worth the risk ' infants are born with very flexible joints , which are also under the effects of relaxin - a hormone women produce when they ’re pregnant to loosen joints and make birth easier			1
' so a newborn 's joints are more prone to issues at this age than any other			2
they need to be able to bend their legs up and out at the hips			0
' his concerns are clear : swaddling infants so their hips and knees are kept straight or together may increase the risk of hip dysplasia and dislocation			1
yet many see professor @entity148 ’s stance as an over-reaction			0
midwife @entity133 says : ' i 'm not sure it 's such a big issue - why would anyone wrap their baby up to the extent that it 's causing developmental problems ? this only happens if you 're rough with your baby , so it ’s unlikely in my view			2
' childcare consultant and author @entity217 , who has worked as a maternity nurse for celebrities including @entity221 , is passionate about the benefits of swaddling			2
' it 's a wonderful way of ensuring babies feel safe and secure when put into their cots , ' she says			0
' i will often go to a home where every time the baby tries to drop off to sleep , his little arms go and he wakes himself up			2
i swaddle him , tuck him in tight and he will normally drop off happily and quickly			0
' she rejects the suggestion that swaddling hurts babies			2
' the fuss that is being made about it being bad for babies ' hips is , i believe , unsubstantiated			0
if we were binding babies then that would be a different matter , but that 's not the same as swaddling , where babies ' legs are n’t restricted			2
' she points out that the precautions she takes when swaddling are the ones any sensible mother would take			2
' obviously , you need to keep an eye on your baby ’s temperature , by feeling at the base of his neck , to avoid the risk of overheating			1
but it ’s a wonderful tool to help your baby settle and sleep well			1
' and sleep , as any parent will tell you , is a big issue			0
in the early days , many parents feel lucky if they get four hours in a row , and i spent the first few weeks with each of my children wondering if i 'd ever know what it felt like to be rested and focused again			0
under wraps in @entity272 , swaddling involved wrapping the baby in linen bands from head to foot until nine months old i was so demented with tiredness i often found myself in the middle of a task , like making up a bottle , and forgetting where i was and having to start all over again			1
who would n't try every sleep trick in the book ? yet teaching parents about swaddling has been gradually dropped from many antenatal courses			0
@entity286 , a midwife childbirth educator at @entity288 ’s @entity287 , says : ' although i do n't mention swaddling as part of my baby - care classes because it 's not a core skill , parents always bring it up - it 's very fashionable at the moment			1
' i swaddled my babies but i 'm not sure i would now because the research on its main benefit - more sleep - is n't good enough to say it makes any difference			0
studies show that at best a child might sleep for an extra half - hour			0
' and i actually think allowing babies to wake slightly makes them learn to settle themselves back to sleep - a key skill if a baby 's ever going to go through the night			1
' @entity286 encourages parents to try swaddling if they like - but to be mindful of their babies ' reactions			0
' if the baby settles and does n't fight it , then i say go with it			0
but if your baby does n't like it , then do n’t force it			0
@entity75 has to be baby - led			0
' midwives do n't live with mothers or know their babies better than a parent does - we can only tailor advice in context with each family ’s routine and preferences			0
' indeed , if swaddling is good enough for a future @entity327 , then surely it ’s good enough for the rest of us ?			0
