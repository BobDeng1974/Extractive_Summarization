by @entity1 reporter published : 22:51 est , 3 december 2013 updated : 23:21 est , 3 december 2013 a new communications satellite that has both public and government applications has been launched into space aboard a private rocket			1
the 22 - story @entity8 rocket lifted off from @entity9 on tuesday evening , carrying the 7,000 - pound satellite			1
it will be placed in geostationary orbit			0
that means it will orbit at a fixed point above @entity16 , in sync with the @entity16 â€™s rotation			0
the rocket is carrying its first commercial payload , a communications satellite the launch was originally scheduled for early this year , but has been delayed by technical issues with the rocket			1
the last try was on @entity32 when two attempts were aborted			0
the @entity35 satellite will be used in conjunction with another communications systems to increase bandwidth capacity in @entity39 and provide expansion of services such as maritime communications and distance learning programs			1
' i 'd like to thank @entity35 for taking a chance on @entity8 , ' company founder and chief executive @entity44 posted on @entity48 an hour before the launch			0
' we 've given it our all			0
' about 30 minutes after liftoff , the satellite , known as @entity35 and worth more than $ 100 million , was in an elliptical orbit that reached more than 50,000 miles from @entity16 , about a quarter of the way to the moon			1
blastoff : after two scrubbed launch attempts , @entity8 's @entity8 rocket finally blasted off on tuesday to send a commercial satellite where no @entity8 payload has gone before : 22,000 miles up , into geostationary orbit from there , @entity35 will maneuver itself down to a circular , 22,369 - mile ( 36,000 - km ) high orbit to provide television , broadband and other communications services to customers in @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and elsewhere in @entity39			1
the delivery of the @entity35 satellite ' confirms the upgraded @entity8 launch vehicle delivers to the industry 's highest performance standards , ' @entity44 said in a statement after the launch			1
' we appreciate @entity35 's early confidence in @entity8 and look forward to launching additional @entity35 satellites in the years to come , ' he said			0
@entity35 is the first commercial communications satellite to be launched from @entity9 in four years			1
in the 1980s , the @entity85 dominated the commercial launch industry , now worth about $ 6.5 billion a year , a report by the @entity84 trade organization showed			1
game changer : @entity35 reportedly paid less than $ 60 million for the launch , which is tens of millions of dollars less than the going rate for satellite launches heading for geostationary orbit the global satellite industry overall had revenues of nearly $ 190 billion in 2012 , including nearly $ 90 billion in television services alone , the trade group said			1
' it 's an extremely important satellite for us , ' @entity96 , chief technology officer of @entity35 , told reporters before the launch			2
' we know that as we go forward into these very significant growth markets that it 's absolutely critical that we have a cost - effective and efficient way to get to orbit			2
that 's really what @entity8 has brought us , ' @entity96 said			0
previous @entity35 satellites were launched primarily aboard @entity108 @entity107 and @entity110 ariane rockets , which cost far more than the approximately $ 55 million the company paid for its ride on @entity8 's @entity8 booster , he said			2
up up and away : @entity8 has a dozen @entity8 9 launches on its manifest for next year , including more geostationary satellites @entity96 would not say exactly how much @entity8 undercut the competition , but did say @entity35 received a discount by agreeing to fly on @entity8 's first mission to high orbits used by communications satellites			0
in addition to a september 29 test flight of an upgraded @entity8 , older versions of the rocket flew five times successfully , including three missions for @entity128 to deliver cargo to the @entity130 , which orbits about 250 miles above @entity16			0
@entity8 's launch schedule includes nearly 50 missions , worth about $ 4 billion			2
about 75 percent of the flights are for commercial customers			0
the company needs one more successful launch of its upgraded @entity8 rocket to be eligible to compete to carry the @entity85 military 's largest and most expensive satellites , a market now monopolized by @entity141 , a partnership of @entity144 and @entity143 .			2

the launch could be a ' game change ' for the satellite industry
launch cost $ 60 million - tens of millions less than the going rate
technical *glitches* halted two launch attempts last week
rocket is carrying a communications satellite
satellite is expected to serve @entity39 for at least *15* years
