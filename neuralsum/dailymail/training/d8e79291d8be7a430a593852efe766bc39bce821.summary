by @entity0 @entity1 says he was told by his teacher to colour in his trainers black to fit with school uniform policy a mother has hit out after her son was ordered to colour the white parts of his trainers with a black marker pen to comply with his school 's uniform code			1
@entity1 , 15 , was hauled out of a lesson when a teacher spotted the white ' swoosh ' and soles on his @entity17 shoes			1
@entity1 says the teacher then handed him a black marker pen and asked him to ' colour in ' the black footwear			1
his mother @entity21 , 38 , has been left furious by the incident and is considering removing @entity1 and his 12 - year - old sister from @entity25 's @entity24 and stopping her youngest son from starting there in september			1
she said : ' what makes me so annoyed is that he 's been wearing these shoes since september and nobody 's said anything			1
' uniforms cost a lot of money as it is			0
i 've got three children and i do n't get any help			0
' it 's annoyed me so much i feel like being a rebel myself and making him buy an orange pair			0
' @entity1 was first given an old pair of black plimsolls to wear despite them being a size too small			2
his mother , of @entity25 , @entity48 , sent her lad back the next day in his original footwear along with a note saying he would n't be changing them			2
but staff at the school came up with an even more drastic solution - and gave him the pen			1
the uniform policy at the 1,620 - pupil secondary school states that children must wear ' plain black shoes '			1
@entity1 's mother insists her children are always neat and tidy and says the school 's uniform policy is petty and ' over-the - top '			1
she says her children have previously complained about being made to wear jumpers and blazers during one of the hottest springs on record			0
she added : ' these are petty little things that do n't make any difference or get in the way of children 's learning			0
' what the school 's doing is encouraging bullying by pointing out all the poor kids who ca n't afford to buy new uniforms			2
' @entity1 's mother , @entity21 , says the rules are ' petty and over-the - top ' and could even encourage bullying headteacher @entity87 said she was unable to comment directly on the complaint without speaking to the child and parent involved			1
but she said she was not aware of any teacher asking children to colour in items of clothing to meet uniform regulations			1
ms @entity87 said : ' it 's not standard practice , but i 'd be lying if i said it did n't happen because i do n't know			0
' it 's very rare for us to be pulling students out of lessons			0
we 've pulled students out of form time between 8:40am and 9am but it would be very unusual for us to do that			0
' details of the uniform are on our website , and in student planners , and we send out letters to parents on a regular basis			2
we 're not petty about it , but we want our kids looking smart			2
' we 're very keen to keep up the standards of the uniform but we 're very tolerant with it coming up to the end of term			0
there has to be a bit of give and take and we realise that			0
' @entity25 's @entity126 school insists it is not being petty and wants to encourage students to dress smartly			0

@entity129 says he was told to colour the white parts of his trainers black
he claims a teacher told him the shoes did not comply with uniform rules
his mother has now hit out at the school calling the policy ' over-the - top '
@entity24 denies *knowledge* of the incident , but wants pupils ' looking smart '
