by @entity0 a country in as much of a financial meltdown as @entity3 could do worse than ask new national team manager @entity4 to give its government a hand balancing the books			1
@entity4 has been appointed the new manager of @entity3 as they turn to the former @entity11 boss to lead the team into a new era			1
once thing is for certain , whatever the highs and lows of his football career , the crafty @entity14 rarely finishes out of pocket			0
when @entity4 was given his marching orders by @entity54 in 2004 , he still had three years on a deal at @entity56 which should have earned £ 2m - a - year in salary payments			1
he stood accused of over-rotating his squad , and picked up the nickname of the ‘ @entity60 ’ , but his period in charge saw @entity11 finish second in the @entity63 and reach the semi-finals of the @entity65			1
it was not enough for @entity54 , who was ready to pay handsomely to get rid of @entity4 for what he considered failure			2
but @entity11 ’s scheduled compensation bill was drastically cut to around £ 1m when their former boss walked into a new job replacing @entity73 - bound @entity72 at @entity37			1
within eight months of taking charge of the @entity76 champions , he was on the look out for a new job yet again and about to bank another hefty bonus for winning nothing			0
the decision to axe @entity4 , taken at a panicked board meeting following the club 's shock elimination from the @entity85 by @entity86 , was a costly one			0
he walked away with a cheque believed to be worth more than £ 4m , which allowed the luxury of two years off before taking his next job			1
ever - changing : @entity4 ( left ) was nicknamed the ' @entity60 ' at @entity11 for his over-rotation of his squad salute : @entity4 bows to the crowd in may 2004 during his last home game in charge against @entity99 ruthless : @entity11 owner @entity54 ( left ) decided to sack @entity4 in 2004 as he sought success @entity102 farewell : @entity104 ' managerial duties ended when @entity3 were knocked out of the @entity105 onto the next challenge : former @entity3 manager @entity104 left after the @entity105 decent showing in @entity102 : @entity3 celebrate after beating the @entity107 in group stage match his self - imposed period in the wilderness ended with his return to management at @entity39 , who , against the odds , he led to serie a safety at the end of the 2006 - 07 season			1
after being at the club less than five months , though , he resigned to take over one of the biggest jobs in world football at @entity31			2
his first season in charge was relatively successful , guiding them to third place a year after they had been rocked by the @entity14 match - fixing scandal			0
but his second campaign was dire , leading to his dismissal after an emergency board meeting despite having a year to run on his original three - year contract			2
handshake : @entity4 ( left ) replaced @entity72 at @entity37 following his sacking from @entity11 axed : @entity4 was sacked by @entity37 after being eliminated from the @entity85 , receiving £ 4m compensation @entity4 was due to receive his final year ’s salary in one lump sum because a clause in the contract covered such an eventuality			1
when his legal team threatened court action in a bid to force @entity31 to stump up the cash , the two parties agreed a cut - price compromise deal which saw him grab around £ 1m			2
by the start of the following season , @entity4 had switched allegiances - and paymasters - to @entity40			2
a familiar pattern emerged ; a bright start and a disappointing finish			0
his resignation by mutual consent followed after a string of miserable results in february 2011			0
remarkably , despite his average record as far as silverware is concerned , @entity4 is never short of offers from the biggest clubs when out of work			0
@entity41 were next to gamble on the man who invariably delivers so little yet costs so much			0
short - lived : @entity4 ( right ) chats with @entity163 ( left ) during his reign as @entity31 manager the parting of the ways was inevitable , but few could believe he was shown the door after just six months in charge			1
he had been under intense pressure after a run of just one win in 10 matches left the club languishing in eighth place in the league table and struggling for @entity178 qualification			0
@entity4 ’s ill - feted reign came to an end in the aftermath of a painful 2 - 0 defeat against his former club @entity31 , @entity41 ’s ninth reverse of that season			1
never down for long , @entity4 fancied a change of scenery and left his homeland in may 2012 to work among the yachts and millionaires of @entity27			2
he can argue a good case for success on the @entity194 riviera , leading the club to second in @entity197 and securing a @entity65 spot after clinching promotion in his first season			0
but after failing to beat @entity202 to the championship , the decision was made to call him the proverbial taxi in may this year			0
the bill is believed to be around £ 3m			0
animated : @entity4 guided @entity27 to promotion to @entity197 and then to the @entity65 during his reign leaving his post : @entity4 coached @entity39 before resiging to move on to a bigger job at @entity14 rivals @entity31			1

@entity4 appointed @entity3 manager on two - year deal on *tuesday*
he has been sacked five times in 10 years and earned more than £ 10million
@entity11 , @entity37 , @entity41 , @entity31 and @entity27 have all sacked him
the 62 - year - old keeps getting big jobs despite poor *trophy* record

nicknamed the ' @entity60 ' at @entity11 due to his over-rotating of his squad
