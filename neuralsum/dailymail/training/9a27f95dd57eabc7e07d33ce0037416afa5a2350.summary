@entity0 , 45 , labelled himself a ' slow learner ' after becoming familiar with the company 's calorie - counting system in 2000 by @entity4 published : 15:16 est , 9 may 2012 updated : 15:40 est , 9 may 2012 shedding unwanted weight is a struggle many are familiar with and that includes the head of @entity9			1
@entity0 , the 45 - year - old president and chief executive officer of @entity9 , has written a book that reveals how he struggled to adapt to the company 's famous calorie - counting points system			1
although he first learned of the system when he joined the company in 2000 , the @entity15 - based ceo told the today show this morning that he was a ' slow learner ' when it came to shedding his own unwanted weight			1
now and then : @entity0 , the ceo of @entity9 , has revealed his own weight loss battle in a new book titled @entity23			1
it took him a long nine years to shed 40lbs the book , titled @entity23 , details how it took mr @entity0 , who has served as ceo since 2006 , almost a decade to shed 40lbs			1
the weight loss finally came as a result of adapting to healthy eating habits rather than focusing on quick - fix solutions such as dieting			1
it is an ethos that @entity9 promotes			0
he said of the extensive struggle : ' honestly , i think because i was in the dieting mentality , which is to be hard - core for two or three months and then … go back to my old life			2
' mr @entity0 , who has weighed 203lbs for the past three years , believes the real key to weight loss is to address an individual 's ' underlying behaviour ' that may work as a contributor to weight gain			1
weight loss king : he went on this morning 's @entity18 ( above ) to speak about the book , which aims to educate people about healthy eating habits and how to stick to them he said : ' establish routines and habits , try to avoid temptation , try to rely less on willpower			2
these are the things i 've learned … lessons that i was n't following for the first nine years that have been saving my skin for the last three			0
' motivational : the book ( above ) reveals his own personal weight weight loss awakening the book also reveals how he put on 45lbs in one year of attending college			0
a doctor 's appointment in 1999 sparked initial health concerns but it was not enough to push him to shed the weight entirely			2
he wrote in the book : ' my first shock was stepping onto my doctor 's scale			2
watching the nurse slide weight after weight to the right before finally landing on 242lbs was a punch to my expanding gut			0
how did this happen ? ' as a tall guy , i could carry my baggage pretty well , and i 'd almost convinced myself that i did n't weigh all that much			0
' he was offered a job at @entity9 at the end of 1999 and while the role was less significant than the one he currently holds , the @entity9 work environment forced him to evaluate his unhealthy weight even further			0
he said : ' in taking the job , i thought it would be a nice perk to maybe lose that weight in the process			0
' nine years later - yes , that 's right : nine years - i reached my goal weight			1
' he added that obesity is no longer just a women 's issue			0
he said : ' men suffer the same ill health effects that women do yet they 're half as likely to do something about it			0
