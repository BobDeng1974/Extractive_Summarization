by @entity0 published : 14:19 est , 20 august 2012 updated : 14:20 est , 20 august 2012 an ancient skull unearthed in @entity2 has reset the clock of human migration to southern @entity5 back 20,000 years			1
the skull , found in a cave in the @entity9 mountains , has been dated to between 46,000 and 63,000 years old - and appears to be the remains of an anatomically modern human being			1
the discovery suggests that the first modern humans to leave @entity14 spread around the world much earlier than was previously thought			1
skull from the mists of time : the researchers studied the fragments , including recognisable teeth and cranium , which date to 63,000 years ago @entity2 , with a population of just under seven million , is bordered by @entity23 and @entity24 to the north , @entity26 to the east , @entity28 to the west and @entity30 to the south			1
lead scientist dr @entity32 , from the @entity33 in the @entity34 , said : ' it 's a particularly old modern human fossil and it 's also a particularly old modern human for that region			0
' there are other modern human fossils in @entity24 or in island south - east @entity5 that may be around the same age , but they either are not well dated or they do not show definitively modern human features			0
' given its age , fossils in this vicinity could be direct ancestors of the first migrants to @entity51			0
' this skull is very well dated and shows very conclusive modern human features			2
' the fossil , discovered in 2009 , is described today in the journal @entity56			0
dr @entity32 said it showed that early modern humans migrating out of @entity14 did not simply follow the coast to the islands of south - east @entity5 and @entity51 , as some experts believe			2
they also travelled northwards into very different types of terrain			0
the @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity2 : a human skull found in the @entity69 appears to be the earliest ' modern ' skull discovered experts believe the ancestors of people alive today either evolved in @entity14 and then colonised the world , or evolved in different locations across the globe			1
most support the ' out - of - africa ' theory			0
' this find supports the ' out - of - @entity14 ' theory of modern human origins rather than a multi-regionalism model , ' said dr @entity32			2
she added that the find supported genetic studies suggesting that modern humans occupied the region at least 60,000 years ago			1
@entity87 , from the @entity88 in @entity89 , who helped study the skull , said : ' we 're looking at fully modern people with no archaic traits at all - that 's what 's so exciting			0
' @entity2 traces its history to the kingdom of @entity98 which existed from the 14th to the 18th century when it split into three separate kingdoms .			2

skull found in cave in @entity9 mountains , @entity2 , dates from 46,000 and 63,000 years ago
previous discoveries suggested humanity only left @entity14 around *27,000* years ago
