in a statement that should be of interest to @entity3 , @entity0 has claimed @entity5 's famous 4 - 0 win against @entity6 in 2009 was due to the aggression showed by their outstanding centre - forward on the night , @entity8			1
although current @entity13 holders real are favourites at @entity14 on wednesday night , one factor in @entity5 's favour is their last @entity16 clash – which the @entity17 won 5 - 0 on aggregate in the last - 16 of the competition			1
@entity0 scored twice in the @entity14 romp and @entity8 and @entity21 were also on target for @entity24 's side in a humiliation for the @entity27 side that prompted them to go out and spend £ 80million on @entity29 the following summer			1
@entity0 credited ' world class ' @entity8 for @entity5 's famous win against @entity6 @entity0 shakes hands with @entity33 after the @entity13 clash , which ended 4 - 0 to @entity5 @entity0 said the win was all thanks to the aggression shown by their outstanding centre - forward on the night ' the reason we came out on top that night was because we were very aggressive with and without the ball , ' said @entity0			1
' we pressed from the front and had a world - class talent there in @entity8			1
he set the tempo up front and we all came behind him			0
we forced @entity6 into mistakes			1
' his comments will surely interest @entity3 who has struck a lethargic figure in a disappointing start to his @entity14 career			1
manager @entity53 has a big choice whether to stick with the @entity55 after he fluffed more chances at @entity57 on sunday but for now the @entity5 boss is trying to encourage his £ 16million striker , who is needed with @entity60 gone and @entity61 injured for a further month			1
' @entity3 was of course disappointed at the weekend			1
he is a goalscorer and wants to score			0
but i have highlighted to him he is getting into the positions			0
as long as he is in there with the possibility to score , i have every confidence he will score			0
' of course he has scored important goals in big games in his career so i am sure if selected he will have a good chance of doing that for us			1
' the @entity72 returned from injury against the @entity75 giants to spearhead a fine @entity5 display at @entity14 @entity8 celebrates his first goal in front of onlooking @entity6 fans during their emphatic victory in 2009 summer signing @entity3 has come in for some criticism since his £ 16 million move to @entity14 @entity0 is n't expecting a repeat of the 4 - 0 scoreline on one of @entity14 's great @entity16 nights			1
' with all respect to their 2009 team , @entity6 have progressed and improved since then			2
we have huge respect for the new @entity6			2
' i ca n't give out any of our tactical secrets but we will have to be at our best individually and collectively			0
' we are now back in the @entity13 so i am not sure @entity6 will come in with any fear			2
they will come in with confidence - i do n't think there are many they worry about facing			0
the @entity5 striker missed a golden opportunity during sunday 's narrow victory at @entity104 on sunday despite fluffing his lines on numerous occasions this season , @entity0 is confident goals will come for @entity3 ' but for us this is a fantastic challenge			1
we are trying to improve , it is almost like a bonus game for us			0
but i know you only enjoy nights like this if we put in a good performance			2
we 'd like to shock a few people tomorrow night			0
' everyone knows what this club is about and the history			0
it is very important to keep @entity13 football here for as long as we can			0
' it was a wonderful evening for myself and the team in 2009			0
we are looking for a similar level of performance tomororow night			2
nights like that live with you forever			0
when giants come into town like @entity6 and you get the result , it makes for fantastic memories			2

@entity0 has claimed @entity5 's famous win against @entity6 was due to the performance of former @entity17 striker @entity8
the win prompted @entity6 's £ 80million signing of @entity29 the following summer
the @entity5 *captain* 's comments will prick the ears of @entity3 , who has had a disappointing start to his @entity14 career
with @entity60 gone and @entity61 still injured manager @entity53 will have a big choice whether to stick with the @entity55
