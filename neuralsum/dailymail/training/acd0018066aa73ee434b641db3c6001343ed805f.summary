by @entity0 a father left his two sons feeling over-the - moon after building them a @entity5 space simulator and life - like mission control center in their bedrooms			1
@entity9 , 35 , spent more than four months piecing the spacecraft together for his four - year - old boy , @entity12 , and around $ 800 on the gravity - defying desk for his six - year - old son , @entity14			1
the spaceship features a number of switches , sound effects , led readouts , joysticks and even a fully - functioning robotic arm			1
' i figured i 'd build him a dual purpose desk , one for work and play - thus , the mission control desk was born			1
' while building that , i realised that i should do something cool for my other son 's room , and the natural solution seemed to be a spaceship			2
@entity48 above : the space simulator features a fully functioning robotic arm switched on father : mr @entity9 built in plenty of buttons and dials for his two sons to play with missions : mr @entity9 said that his sons love playing at astronauts and take it in turn to be in charge ambitious : the project mr @entity9 undertook for his sons certainly was n't ' an everyday @entity64 job ' they both love playing space and their ability to work together impresses me			1
' they have n't learned all the space lingo yet , so their missions are often silly , but that 's perfect			0
' they spot aliens and deploy payloads and make up all sorts of strange things			0
' they incorporate other toys into their space play , as well , such as wooden blocks , @entity81 , and stuffed animals - they really enjoy using it			2
' family bond : mr @entity9 pictured holding @entity85 while his wife , @entity86 , holds @entity14 full - time videomaker mr @entity9 said he completed the entire project from the comfort of his garage and that his sons often enjoy going on ' space mission ' together			2
he said : ' they alternate mission control and astronaut duties - it all depends on who feels like they want to run the show and who feels like they want to fly the ship			1
' i designed every aspect to be inexpensive , yet straightforward enough for other self - taught hobbyists to replicate			2
' although it was a rather complicated build , no - one should rule it out as something they ca n't do			0
' i 'm not an engineer and i have no formal training in electronics			0
' i 'm just a self - taught hobbyist fairly far along in my learning journey			0
' with the @entity112 , so much knowledge is available for folks that want to teach themselves new skills			0
' i just want to provide my boys with a broad variety of experiences to show them what is possible and help them discover and develop their talents and passions			0

@entity9 spent four months building a spacecraft for his four - year - old
the @entity32 father also built a mission control desk for his other son
