@entity0 was caught in a war of words with @entity4 nationalists last night after he accused them of being ‘ fascist scum ’			1
the @entity9 @entity8 leader said the left - wing extremists who trapped him in an @entity12 pub were the ‘ ugly face of @entity4 nationalism ’ pursuing an anti-english agenda			1
he challenged @entity4 ’s first minister @entity16 to condemn the protesters who had chanted ‘ @entity18 , @entity18 ’ , jostled him and told him to ‘ go back to @entity19 ’			1
up against it : @entity0 being escorted by police officers as he leaves the @entity23 pub as protestors heckle him mr @entity0 also hit out at the @entity25 after a @entity27 presenter appeared to question his right to debate @entity4 issues			1
in the extraordinary scenes on thursday night the police forced mr @entity0 to take refuge in the @entity33 ’ @entity35 pub on @entity12 ’s @entity36 for his own safety after the mob of supposedly anti-racist protesters launched the hostile demonstration against him , preventing him from leaving a press conference			1
dozens of activists from the @entity45 group , most of them students , had gathered on the street outside the press conference , where a giant ‘ @entity50 for @entity4 ’ banner was held @entity52 chants included ‘ you can stick your @entity54 up your a * * * ’ and ‘ go back to @entity19 , you ’re not welcome here ’			1
the @entity45 group is not formally linked to the @entity57 , but mr @entity0 suggested ‘ elements ’ of the @entity57 had the same anti-english views			2
he said : ‘ it was a demonstration dressed up as being anti-racism but in fact in itself was deeply racist , with a total hatred of the @entity19 and a desire for @entity4 to be independent from @entity64			1
‘ my goodness me , if this is the face of @entity4 nationalism it ’s a pretty ugly picture			2
‘ the anger , the snarling , the shouting , the swearing was all linked in to a desire for the @entity54 to be burnt and extinguished from @entity4 forever			1
‘ i must say i have heard before that there are some parts of @entity4 nationalism that are akin to fascism but yesterday i saw that face to face			2
’ @entity8 leader @entity0 was confronted by protesters in the @entity23 pub in @entity12 mr @entity0 hung up the phone on his @entity83 @entity4 interview after a presenter asked him to ‘ remind me how many elected representatives you have in @entity4 ’			1
he replied : ‘ absolutely none			2
but rather more than the @entity25 do			2
‘ we could have had this interview in @entity19 a couple of years ago , although i would n’t have met with such hatred that i ’m getting from your questions , and frankly i ’ve had enough of this interview			2
’ @entity95 leader @entity94 described mr @entity0 ’s treatment as an ‘ attack on free speech ’ and urged mr @entity16 to condemn it			1
‘ we ’ve always known that supporters of independence can be very passionate for their cause but the offensive and aggressive behaviour toward @entity0 was unacceptable , ’ he said			0
a second opinion poll has put @entity8 on 18 per cent			1
the latest survey by @entity107 found support was at the same level as the party 's all - time high recorded by @entity111 this week			0
@entity113 ’s lead over the @entity114 was trimmed to nine points , with mr @entity117 ’s party falling three points to 37 per cent and mr @entity120 ’s @entity119 gaining three to 28 per cent			0
the @entity121 are on just seven per cent			0
‘ of course i disagree with @entity0 on his unpleasant and dishonest agenda but he will be defeated by argument not aggression			0
‘ it was deeply ironic when these self - proclaimed anti-racist campaigners told an @entity19 to get back to his own country			0
@entity129 turned racist but were too ignorant to notice			2
i am sure most people in @entity4 will be appalled at this behaviour			0
’ @entity133 , the @entity134 mp , said the protest was bad for @entity4			0
in a message on @entity137 he said : ‘ events in @entity12 yesterday forcing the evacuation of @entity0 were a pure embarrassment for @entity4			2
and the shape of things to come			0
’ the @entity144 campaign which is pushing for independence in next year ’s referendum on @entity4 ’s future , distanced itself from the ugly protests			0
a spokesman said : ‘ @entity144 continues to run a positive campaign and we condemn any and all forms of intimidation			0
’ but the @entity57 said mr @entity0 had ‘ lost the plot ’			0
mr @entity16 , who leads the @entity57 , claimed mr @entity0 knew ‘ absolutely nothing ’ about matters north of the border			1
he added : ‘ this is a man who does n’t like getting challenged because when the obnoxious views of his party are put to him then his bubble deflates very quickly and that is what we saw in his panicky interview this morning			2
’ mr @entity0 was escorted by police officers away from the protest after the pub was surrounded by a mob chanting ' @entity18 scum ' @entity171 confirmed two men were arrested for assault and breach of the peace at thursday ’s protest			1
one revealed on @entity137 that he is @entity19 , and criticised mr @entity0 for branding yesterday ’s protest ‘ anti-english ’			0
he said : ‘ as a proud @entity19 , arrested yesterday for protesting , i dispute these claims			0
’ @entity179 of the @entity45 group also defended the protest , saying : ‘ our protest was to make it clear that @entity8 ’s rise in @entity19 is in no way reflective of @entity4			1
’ @entity8 has never made a breakthrough in @entity4 , receiving just 0.91 per cent of the regional vote in the 2011 @entity190 election			1
but mr @entity0 said he was confident the party would win get its first mep in @entity4 in next year ’s @entity194 elections			0
listen to the full interview here by @entity196 the mobbing of @entity0 by extreme left nationalists in @entity12 has exposed to the rest of @entity9 what the @entity8 leader calls the ‘ ugly face ’ of @entity4 separatism			1
even though members of hard - left activist groups are seldom the brightest bulbs on the chandelier , the fact they could abuse @entity0 as a ‘ racist ’ while simultaneously shouting at him to ‘ go back to @entity19 ’ – without any conscious irony – says it all			1
while it should be emphasised that there are many thousands of decent @entity4 who have embraced the separatist agenda without harbouring any animosity towards @entity19 people , it is an inescapable fact that a significant element within the nationalist movement is motivated by anti-english sentiment			0
he had to be taken away in a police van after a taxi was blocked by the crowd this bigotry was aggravated in the 1990s by the film braveheart which , though historical hokum , provoked an emotional response among many young people that has not evaporated even today			2
the aggressive ‘ @entity234 ’ – embittered nationalists who pour out bile on the internet and in the @entity238 – are the spearhead of a movement that , in any other ethnic context , would be called racist			1
a @entity240 report five months ago recorded a 23 per cent increase in the number of white @entity9 people targeted as victims of racial crime			0
the figures were not broken down into the component nations of the @entity9 , but few of them are likely to have been @entity249			0
even allowing for anti-irish sentiment , it is clear that anti-english abuse is on the rise			0
nor is this shameful prejudice confined to the @entity255 that attacked mr @entity0			0
last december , @entity4 writer @entity256 provoked outrage when he denounced @entity19 ‘ colonists ’ in the @entity4 arts world			0
one of those ‘ colonists ’ , @entity261 , who had presided over the establishment of the @entity264 and promoted successful plays such as @entity266 , revealed when she left to take up a new post at the @entity268 that , throughout her time in @entity4 , anti-english bullying had made her feel ‘ paralysed ’ artistically			0
troubled waters : controversy has continued to follow @entity0 the passions aroused by the rise of the @entity57 and the drawn - out ‘ neverendum ’ campaign on independence have had an unhealthy effect on @entity4 society			0
although the mob that threatened mr @entity0 and broke up his press conference was not drawn from the @entity57 , @entity16 ’s party can not plausibly disown these thugs , from an extreme left group known as @entity284			1
at the launch of the @entity144 campaign for the independence referendum in @entity289 on january 16 , @entity285 , deputy first minister of @entity4 , shared a platform with @entity291 , of @entity284 , along with other assorted leftists			2
words do not come more weasel than the terms in which @entity16 responded to the question of whether he condemned the intimidation of mr @entity0			1
despite two arrests and damning video footage , the first minister said : ‘ if there ’s been any law - breaking – and that ’s yet to be established – then obviously we condemn that , as we always do in @entity4 , but you ’ve got to get things into context			2
a student demonstration is n’t the @entity310 trial			0
’ or , in other words , boys will be boys , no harm done if the leader of a @entity9 political party is prevented from communicating with the @entity4 public and if his attempts at civilised debate are drowned out by moronic chants of ‘ racist @entity18 scum ’			1
as for mr @entity0 and @entity8 , they should understand that the majority of @entity4 will give them a fair hearing			1
in a local council by - election in @entity325 this year , @entity8 beat the @entity121 back into fifth place			1
after the frenzy of the referendum , where the polls consistently forecast the nationalists will be heavily defeated , @entity4 politics will realign			2
with both the @entity57 and the @entity121 in decline , there could then be opportunities for @entity8			1
in particular , disillusioned @entity336 voters could rally to @entity8 , appalled that @entity120 , in alliance with @entity113 and the @entity121 , is planning to give quasi-independence – so - called ‘ @entity339 ’ – to the @entity4 parliament			1
if that is to happen , @entity8 will have to abandon its present proposal to hand all tax - raising powers to @entity190			1
if it does , it could yet be a player in @entity4 where , contrary to recent appearances , democracy is not dead			0
@entity196 is a @entity289 - based author and political commentator			0

@entity8 leader ends @entity351 interview for not telling ' truth ' about nationalists
