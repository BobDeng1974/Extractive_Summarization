it ’s hard to recall a bowling performance as complete as that from @entity3			2
sure , it was a good toss to win and conditions were ideal			0
but they barely put a foot wrong until they allowed @entity9 and @entity10 to scrape together a few for the last wicket			0
even that , though , only took @entity14 to 148			2
it was important that @entity16 and @entity17 backed up the two big guns			1
@entity16 has bowled pretty well in this series without much luck , while @entity17 has been short of rhythm			1
backing : @entity16 of @entity3 celebrates during the fifth and final test of the series against @entity14 high fives : @entity3 's @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity16 celebrate after catching @entity14 's @entity27 back up : @entity17 was needed to help @entity26 and @entity28 in bowling during @entity3 's brilliant session read the full report from @entity33 @entity32 day one at the oval here ! but it was clear that @entity36 now has more faith in them , just as he ’s developed faith in @entity40			1
for maybe the first time , the captain was n’t trying to make sure that one of @entity26 and @entity28 was always bowling			1
@entity36 has n’t suddenly become a brilliant captain because his seamers are bowling well , just as he was n’t a dreadful captain when they were struggling earlier in the summer			1
but he ’ll be quietly excited about the mood around this team			0
waiting in the wings are @entity50 and @entity51 , while next off the batting rank are guys like @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and — in limited - overs cricket — @entity58			0
@entity59 ’s in the mix too			0
when you look at where they ’ve come from , it ’s quite an effort			0
losing 5 - 0 in @entity65 , the home defeat by @entity67 , then going 1 - 0 down to @entity14			2
the whole team deserves a lot of credit			0
but the two men @entity36 owes most to are @entity26 and @entity28			1
in a gruelling five - @entity73 series , they ’ve been the guys who have come through and kept up the pressure on the likes of @entity76 and @entity77			0
keeping up : @entity26 finds time to have a bit of fun on the first day of @entity3 vs @entity14 at the @entity80 technique : @entity26 ( pictured ) and @entity28 are the two men who captain @entity36 can thank the most fit : in a gruelling five - @entity73 series , @entity26 ( pictured ) and @entity28 have been the guys who have kept up the fact that those two keep making the same mistakes is down to the pressure exerted by @entity3 ’s new - ball bowlers			1
@entity76 was bowled by another @entity28 nip - backer , while @entity77 has forgotten where his off stump is , mainly thanks to the working over @entity26 has given him			1
as for @entity14 , their batsmen look mentally shot — with the exception of @entity9			2
he came in for a bit of criticism after taking wednesday off to go shooting , but obviously a sense of perspective helps a bloke like him who has so much on his plate			0
a few of his team - mates could maybe do with something similar			0
bowler : @entity28 may require knee surgery after this test but looked to keep up his high intensity on friday celebrate : @entity28 has helped revive @entity36 's captaincy with his fine form against @entity14 throughout the series			1

@entity16 and @entity17 took three @entity114 wickets each on day one
@entity28 and @entity26 took two *apiece* as @entity14 fell for 148
@entity36 has not become a brilliant captain because his seamers are bowling well - he was not dreadful when they were struggling either
