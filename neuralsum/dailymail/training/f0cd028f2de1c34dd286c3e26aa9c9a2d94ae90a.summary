by @entity0 published : 03:27 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 17:05 est , 5 march 2013 a woman whose breasts were so saggy that she had to fold them up to fit them into her bra is looking forward to finding love after a breast reduction on @entity8 has changed her life			1
@entity10 , 47 , had large breasts from a young age and when she gained a lot of weight as an adult her bra size expanded to an incredible size @entity17			1
at her heaviest @entity10 weighed 25 stone			1
she lost almost 13 stone through bariatric surgery but was left with breasts that sagged over her tummy and were still a @entity24			2
no confidence : @entity10 had large breasts from a young age but when she gained a lot of weight and was up to 25 stone , her breasts weighed in at a whopping @entity17 and became very saggy leaving her with little confidence she had to double her breasts over to fit them into a bra			1
speaking to dr @entity33 on the @entity35 show , she said : ' i have no self esteem and because i 've got no confidence , i ca n't possibly contemplate a relationship			0
' i do n't ever look at myself in the mirror , only to do my hair			0
i do n't ever look at my body because it 's so disgusting			0
' i 've come to see you today because i 've lost a lot of weight and i 've got a lot of loose skin , especially on my boobs			0
' following her extreme weight loss , @entity10 had been left with lots of loose skin , which she said she found really hard to deal with			1
a real pain : her heavy breasts gave her back ache , neck ache and she would get a rash underneath and often infections so she set about changing her life on the show problematic : dr @entity33 agreed that @entity10 's breasts were hugely problematic for her and that her nipples pointed at her feet her heavy breasts gave her back ache , neck ache and she would get a rash underneath and often infections			1
dr @entity33 agreed that @entity10 â€™s breasts were hugely problematic for her			1
he said : ' you 've lost a lot of weight but your breasts are very deflated and , to put it kindly , your nipples are now pointing at your feet			2
' a protein called elastin helps skin ping back into place after it has been stretched			0
however , when @entity10 weighed 25st , her skin was stretched so much and for so long that when she lost the weight it was no longer effective			1
happy : speaking to dr @entity33 after the surgery , @entity10 said that she is over the moon with her new breasts and is looking forward to living her life fully dr @entity33 added : ' what 's good is that you 've got nice healthy skin all up here and i think if we reconstruct the breasts and place them back where they should be with the nipples pointing upwards , you 're going to end up with a nice pair of breasts			1
' he referred her to @entity97 , mr @entity98 at the @entity99 in @entity100 for a reconstructed augmented mastopexy to uplift the breasts and give them back some shape and volume			0
while mr @entity98 admitted that helping @entity10 would be a big challenge , he made plans for her to undergo surgery			2
speaking ahead of the surgery , @entity10 said : ' i ca n't wait for this to actually be done because then i will be able to get on with my life and move forward , get more confident and actually just live my life instead of just existing			2
' mr @entity98 moved her nipple up completely , removed all excess skin and reshaped the breast , which took a total of three hours			0
her breasts had to be strong enough to support the implant so he removed as much of the saggy skin as he could , then created a pocket within the breast in which an implant was inserted			2
in total , he has removed 1.5kg of flesh ; the equivalent of two guinea pigs			1
speaking to dr @entity33 after the surgery , @entity10 said that she is over the moon with her new breasts and is looking forward to living her life fully			1
' i feel much better , a million per cent better , especially when i have a shower			0
before my boobs were so horrendous that i had to hook them over my arm to wash but now i do n't have to do that			0
she added : ' i have n't seen my nipples in 35 years so to actually see them and know i 've got some is quite good			0
