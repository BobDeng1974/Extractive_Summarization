by @entity0 , @entity2 political editor and @entity3 in @entity4 @entity5 , the younger of vice president @entity7 's two sons , is joining the board of directors of @entity10 's largest private natural gas producer , a firm controlled by a former natural resources minister to @entity13 , the nation 's recently toppled leader			1
@entity16 sources are lashing out at the news , with anti-globalization and anti-american commentators throwing rhetorical bombs in @entity22 's direction and saying the move smacks of @entity2 ' colonialism ' in the @entity26 state			1
' for the @entity2 it is in principle quite traditional for the relatives of state leaders to be involved in private business in regions where the @entity2 state is rather active , ' said @entity34 , director of the @entity35 in @entity4			2
' historically , this practice was widespread in the @entity38 region , which was linked to the @entity2 by a semi-colonial relationship , ' he told @entity40			1
' we can now see them trying to extend the same practice to @entity10			0
' on thursday the state - owned news agency @entity44 headlined an editorial : ' @entity2 gets hands on @entity48 's @entity47			2
' the outlet claimed @entity22 had taken ' another step to grip @entity10 's state resources			2
the editorial featured an interview with far - left @entity2 commentator @entity54 , who called the move ' one of numerous examples of @entity38 's dark side			1
' awkward : @entity5 ( r ) is joining @entity10 's largest privately held gas company , and will serve a firm controlled by a former cabinet minister to the deposed president @entity13 tension : pro-russian militants stand guard amid heightened tensions at a checkpoint in @entity68 , @entity10 -- near the eastern @entity70 region where @entity72 ' largest gas reserves are located ' @entity22 wages all its wars for unchallenged dominance , ' @entity54 said			1
' it wants state enterprises sold to @entity79 corporations at fire sale prices			0
it wants control over state resources			0
permanent war is official @entity2 policy and @entity38 's empire of bases reflects its belligerency			2
its agenda is self - destructive and ca n't be sustained			0
' ' it 's too late for mere scattered reforms , ' he added			0
' unwilling to change , @entity38 is plagued by the same dynamic that doomed past empires			0
' eyebrows have been raised across @entity22 since the @entity97 first broke the news late tuesday			0
when he visited @entity10 in april , the @entity2 vice president was supportive of @entity79 demonstrators who deposed the @entity16 - backed @entity13 in february			1
he stressed in @entity101 that @entity10 must ' fight the cancer of corruption that is endemic in your system right now			0
' the country 's may 25 election put a @entity79 - backed president in power , but any resulting stability has been short - lived as it brought a backlash from supporters of @entity16 president @entity113 in the country 's eastern regions			1
@entity10 now teeters on the edge of civil war as @entity113 has pressed his advantage and scooped up territory , and @entity121 insurgency forces seek independence for eastern regions and refuse to accept the election 's legitimacy			0
the 44 - year - old @entity7 is joining @entity72 at a time when the @entity2 and western @entity128 nations are making a concerted effort to help @entity10 assert its energy independence from @entity4			1
but @entity131 , deputy dean of the @entity132 and @entity133 , told @entity40 that ' it is clear that this has nothing to do with investment ' in the company			0
' most likely it has been done at the @entity10 side 's request , ' he said			0
' it is a kind of image thing : @entity10 has just received the first tranche of a loan from the @entity145 and it of course wants to demonstrate that people from the @entity2 elite will now come into @entity10 companies and they will be followed by investment and new technology			2
' ' it is the kind of element of support in that does not cost the @entity2 anything , ' @entity131 explained			0
in addition to sabers , the @entity158 has rattled chains in recent weeks , emphasizing that @entity10 owes it billions and threatening to cut off gas supplies , largely as a response to the former @entity166 republic 's stepwise moves toward the @entity167			2
the @entity169 - registered @entity168 said that the younger @entity7 will head its legal unit and use his platform as chairman of @entity173 to seek international support for the company			2
' i believe that my assistance in consulting the company on matters of transparency , corporate governance and responsibility , international expansion and other priorities will contribute to the economy and benefit the people of @entity10 , ' @entity5 said in a statement released on the company 's website			2
@entity13 ( @entity189 ) and @entity16 president @entity113 ( r ) have been mutually supportive for years , leading the fallen @entity10 leader to seek refuge in @entity4 this year after @entity79 demonstrators forced him out of office the company will likely see increased profits in the coming year as it sells to a domestic marketplace accustomed to seeing steep discounts on @entity16 - supplied gas			1
now that @entity113 has taken an adversarial stance toward @entity101 , those markdowns are gone – raising prices nationwide and opening up a path for @entity202 to increase its margins			0
@entity168 also announced to weeks ago that @entity204 , a college roommate of secretary of state @entity206 's stepson , who is heir to the @entity208 ketchup fortune , had joined its board to help attract @entity2 investors			0
the company 's new power brokers , according to speculation from @entity213 , might be its leverage against @entity16 intervention : most of its holdings are in eastern @entity10 's @entity70 , a region that 's nearer to @entity16 than most of the country and a prime long - term target for a future @entity113 advance			1
during his daily press briefing on wednesday , @entity225 press secretary @entity224 punted questions to the vice president 's office			1
' @entity5 and other members of the family are obviously private citizens , ' @entity224 offered , ' and where they work is not an endorsement by the president or vice president			1
' @entity237 spokeswoman @entity236 similarly brushed off a question about whether there were concerns about the @entity7 appointment , saying , ' no , there are not			0
' @entity243 , a spokeswoman for vice president @entity7 , said in a statement that his son ' is a private citizen and a lawyer			1
the vice president does not endorse any particular company and has no involvement with this company			2
' the @entity253 reported wednesday that @entity168 is controlled by @entity254 , a former member of @entity255 in @entity13 's ' @entity256 ' who first served as minister of environmental protection , and then as minister of ecology and natural resources – later losing that post and becoming deputy secretary of @entity10 's @entity263 until the @entity13 government collapsed			1
grilled : @entity225 press secretary @entity224 insisted that @entity5 is a ' private citizen , ' and his new job does n't constitute ' an endorsement by the president or vice president ' @entity5 , shown with mom @entity269 , is chair of the @entity173 and a former senior vice president with @entity271 @entity10 press reports describe a pattern in which @entity254 used his positions to approve a large number of oil and gas drilling permits – a sort of financial insurance policy against the kind of regime change that came a few years later			1
@entity13 fled @entity101 after he was removed from power and an arrest warrant was issued , accusing him of the mass - murder of opposition protesters			0
president @entity285 added him to @entity38 's international sanctions list in march , blocking him from entry into the @entity2 and authorizing the freezing of his assets			2
@entity290 , executive director of the left - leaning ethics watchdog group @entity291 in @entity22 , told @entity292 that the @entity7 appointment in @entity10 should n't be seen as a conflict of interest , regardless of how it dovetails with @entity2 policy			1
' it ca n't be that because your dad is the vice president , you ca n't do anything , ' @entity290 told @entity292			0
but @entity16 observers were less understanding			0
@entity302 , director of the @entity303 in @entity4 , called @entity5 's hiring part of ' the practice of so - called revolving doors that is widespread in @entity38 – when big companies and politicians lobbying for their interests establish links at the level of kinship relationships in one way or another			1
' ' this practice is now also being extended to @entity10 , ' he told @entity40			0
professor @entity315 of the @entity316 , said that ' at this kind of level business and politics are inseparable : being the son of the @entity2 vice president , it is much easier to talk to other serious businessmen and open the requisite doors			1
this always has been and always will be the case			0
' a @entity16 gas industry source added : ' the arrival of the son of @entity2 vice president to the @entity330 of the company developing @entity10 subsoil , shows the apparent interest @entity2 oligarchs to energy of @entity10 , which is directly related to @entity2 foreign policy interests			1

@entity5 will sit on the board of @entity72 , the largest privately - held natural gas firm in @entity10
the company is controlled by a former natural resources minister to the ousted @entity10 president @entity13
a @entity16 economics *school* dean compared the move to the ' semi-colonial relationship ' between the @entity2 and nations in @entity38
@entity2 muscle may have been brought aboard to insulate the company from @entity4 , since its largest holdings are near the @entity16 border
the @entity225 , the vice president 's office and the @entity237 all deny there 's any conflict of interest , saying @entity7 's son is a ' private citizen '
