@entity0 lost its lucrative @entity2 mainline franchise yesterday and its boss , sir @entity3 , immediately predicted the winning rail operator would ‘ go bankrupt ’ as a result			1
@entity0 has run the service from @entity7 to @entity8 for 14 years , but was beaten by @entity9 in a bidding process the tycoon described as ‘ insane ’			1
sir @entity3 said the winning £ 6.5billion deal was ‘ verging on suicidal ’ and vowed never to bid for a rail franchise again unless @entity15 personally apologises to him			1
ministers insisted the bid had been ‘ tested ’ and found to be ‘ robust ’ , accusing sir @entity3 of ‘ amnesia ’ over his own rail firm ’s failures			1
but the @entity0 tycoon said travellers will be the losers from what he feared would be a string of broken promises leading to big fare rises and worsening services			2
overall passenger satisfaction virgin : 91 per cent satisfied @entity9 : 85 per cent satisfied @entity39 virgin : 89 per cent satisfied @entity9 : 83 per cent satisfied value for money virgin : 59 per cent satisfied @entity9 : 49 per cent satisfied dealing with delays virgin : 54 per cent satisfied @entity9 : 42 per cent satisfied room to sit and stand virgin : 80 per cent satisfied @entity9 : 70 per cent satsfied data from june 's passenger survey report via @entity46 unions and @entity20 agreed and even the @entity48 appeared to share his concerns as shares in @entity9 – @entity53 ’s biggest train operator – plummeted			1
among his unlikely allies is the militant @entity57 union which called the deal ‘ a total con ’ and is threatening industrial action over feared job losses			1
sir @entity3 said @entity9 had bid £ 750million more than his own @entity0 but claimed this was ‘ too much ’ and predicted @entity9 would back out before the end of the contract			1
yesterday ’s decision also sparked a row over the true cost of the winning bid – the @entity70 claimed @entity9 had bid £ 5.5billion			1
but when challenged by the @entity72 it admitted that the true figure was at least £ 1billion more when a key 20 - month extension clause is counted			0
unions believe @entity9 and the government had tried to ‘ spin ’ the figures to prevent jitters in the @entity48 and concern among taxpayers			1
stung by the criticisms , transport minister @entity82 accused sir @entity3 of ‘ amnesia ’ about the poor performance and troubles his own franchises , @entity0 and @entity86 , had faced in the past			1
she insisted the new franchise would deliver ‘ big improvements for passengers with more seats and plans for more services ’ and passenger satisfaction targets included for the first time			2
the minister stressed that @entity9 will face penalties totalling £ 265million in bonds and guarantees if it ‘ walks away ’ early – a sum critics deride as ‘ peanuts			1
’ @entity9 says it will cut the price of the most expensive standard ‘ anytime ’ fares by 15 per cent over the first two years , but passengers will still face @entity76 - sanctioned inflation - busting rises of up to 11 per cent on regulated fares			2
action : @entity57 general secretary @entity107 says the union is already preparing a ballot for industrial action over threatened job cuts while rail minister @entity82 said ' big improvements for passengers ' were planned upset : sir @entity3 has taken to @entity112 to express his frustration with the decision suggesting @entity9 offered way too much money for the franchise while accusing the government of ' insanity ' in its decision @entity120 was awarded the @entity122 franchise in 2007 - a year after the @entity123 ( @entity123 ) was forced to quit the franchise in 2006 because of financial problems			1
it agreed to pay the government £ 1.4bn to run the @entity122 main line , which runs between @entity128 and @entity7 , until 2015			1
it was operated by a subsidiary of @entity120 , @entity131 , which is a stand - alone company			0
at the time , many rail analysts said it had paid too much for the franchise			0
@entity131 assumed that revenue from fares would rise by around 10 per cent a year			0
however , in 2009 it went up by a recession - hit 0.3 per cent , and as a result @entity120 lost £ 20million in the first six months			0
the firm was told by its lawyers that it could walk away from the contract , and lose a maximum of £ 72million as a result			2
the government eventually stripped the firm of its contract in 2009 after it failed to make contracted payments			2
@entity147 announced it would temporarily re-nationalise the franchise before re-tendering in 2010			0
in a strongly - worded statement , sir @entity3 said that he was ‘ extremely disappointed ’ with the franchise decision made by the @entity70			1
he said @entity123 and @entity120 had been hit with bankruptcy after they ‘ overbid ’ for the @entity122 mainline franchise			0
he went on : ‘ sadly , the government has chosen to take that risk with @entity9 and we only hope they will continue to drive dramatic improvements on this line for years to come without letting everybody down			1
’ sir @entity3 , who is currently on his private island of @entity160 in the @entity161 , added that this was the fourth time @entity0 had been outbid in a franchise tender process			1
he went on : ‘ on the past three occasions , the winning operator has come nowhere close to delivering their promised plans and revenue , and has let the public and country down dramatically			0
‘ @entity123 and @entity120 over-promised in order to win the franchise and spectacularly ran into financial difficulties in trying to deliver their plans			0
‘ the @entity122 is still in government ownership and its service is outdated and underinvested , costing passengers and the country dearly as a result			0
‘ insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results			0
when will the @entity70 learn ? ’ he said he had not made ‘ a fuss ’ when @entity0 lost three previous bids , but said : ‘ on this occasion i feel enough is enough			0
’ he was now considering legal action and would leave ‘ no stone unturned			0
’ ministers say the new franchise will provide an extra 12,000 seats from 11 new six - car electric trains from december 2016			2
@entity9 chief executive @entity193 said his company would be making ‘ significant improvements , including reduced journey times , and introducing new direct services ’			1
he insisted : ‘ our track record is that we do deliver			0
’ all change : @entity0 has operated the @entity2 line for 15 years , introducing tilting high - speed @entity202 ( pictured ) trains to the route and increasing passenger levels from around 13 million a year in 1997 by @entity206 sir @entity3 is extremely talented at two things – making piles of money from his virgin brand and feuding			1
his list of previous enemies includes @entity215 boss @entity214 and the former treasury mandarin @entity216 , who thwarted his bid to win the @entity220 franchise			0
so it was predictable that he would unleash a torrent of fury when @entity224 lost the @entity2 operating franchise to @entity9 yesterday			2
the decision , @entity3 said , was pure ‘ insanity			1
’ he claimed @entity9 had bid far too much for the franchise and risked exposing passengers to poorer service and bigger fares			2
the government says benefits of the new franchise will include : - around 12,000 extra seats a day when the new 11 six - car electric trains come into service - 106 extra @entity202 carriages which will deliver more than 28,000 extra daily seats - a number of new services including a @entity242 to @entity243 service from 2013 and , from 2016 , services from @entity7 to @entity246 , @entity247 and @entity248 - journey time improvements between @entity7 and @entity250 are planned , as well as additional services from @entity7 to @entity252			1
- @entity253 will spend at least £ 22 million on a station investment programme			0
@entity9 , he suggested , was likely to suffer a similar fate to previous franchise bidders who had over-reached themselves and ended up in financial difficulty , letting down customers and the country as a whole			2
this might strike some as a bit rich coming from a man whose potentially lucrative takeover of @entity267 could leave the @entity268 with a £ 400million loss			0
@entity193 , the chief executive of @entity9 , reckons @entity3 is a bad loser			1
‘ if he had won , he would just be cashing a very large cheque on @entity160 , ’ @entity193 said yesterday			0
so who is right ? the reaction from the stock market seemed to come down on the side of @entity277			0
shares in @entity9 sank like a stone , losing six per cent of their value			2
by contrast , @entity281 , @entity277 ’s joint venture partner in @entity224 , saw its shares rise almost two per cent			0
the stock market , though , is notoriously volatile and a cool analysis of the proposals suggests there is less of a gulf between the bids than @entity3 ’s outburst might suggest			2
@entity9 has pledged to return £ 5.5bn to the government over the life of the franchise , while @entity0 offered £ 4.8bn			1
whether or not @entity9 will actually be able to make this payment , of course , depends on how much revenue it can extract from passengers			2
it reckons it can squeeze out growth of 10.4 per cent a year , compared with the 10.2 per cent @entity0 made over the past decade and the 8.5 per cent growth target it set			0
that is a tall order , @entity0 has already transformed a line that had been a basket case , meaning there is less scope for future improvements			0
@entity9 insists it can deliver by providing more seats on more trains			2
as for the threat to services and jobs , it argues @entity0 ’s bid involved paring £ 45million from costs , double the amount of cost - cutting @entity9 is proposing			1
the stakes in this row are very high			0
if it turns out that @entity9 has indeed overplayed its hand , it may well end up taking an axe to jobs			1
as a nuclear option , it could simply walk away from the franchise , admittedly with a £ 265million penalty			0
passengers could be forgiven for thinking that both sides in this row are as bad as each other , while they are merely piggybank in the middle .			0

@entity9 will take over the route from @entity7 to @entity8 in december
it said its bid was £ 5.5bn but it has now *emerged* that it 's closer to £ *7bn*
@entity57 union warns of cuts to jobs , passenger services and rising prices
it said decision lays bare the ' whole *sordid* *enterprise* ' of rail privatisation
taxpayers are subsidising the *railways* by £ *3bn* a year more than in 1994
sir @entity3 said the government was ' taking a risk ' with the new contract
he threatened to quit trains and said the bidding *system* was ' flawed '
