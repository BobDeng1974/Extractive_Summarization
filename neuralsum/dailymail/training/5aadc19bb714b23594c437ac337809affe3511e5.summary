most of us have stayed in the kind of hotel room we 'd like to run a @entity5 cloth around before we touch anything			1
whether its a film of grease over everything , hairs in the bath or even cockroaches - some hotel staff really need to get their pinnies out			1
and now , a new study from hotel booking website @entity17 has dished the dirt on the world 's cleanest - and more importantly its filthiest cities for an overnight stay			1
six million customers were surveyed and the cities were scored out of ten , for their cleanliness			1
guests in @entity43 could also eat their food from the floor			1
@entity46 however scored an own goal : the @entity48 was an excellent opportunity for the hotels in @entity46 to improve their image			1
however the whole uproar about the @entity48 seems to have left little time or energy for a ' clean - up '			2
in comparison with the previous football - free year the scores for cleanliness and hygiene were considerably lower in @entity34 ( 7.29 ) and in @entity61 ( 7.69 )			2
runner up ( but not one to boast about ) : @entity62 came in second place for dirtiest hotels sleep soundly : @entity38 was voted as the city with the cleanest hotel rooms worldwide a glance at the online customer evaluations of @entity70 hotels can also help to prevent unpleasant surprises such as in @entity72 ( 7.63 )			1
in the @entity74 , @entity73 came top with 8.15 points , while hoteliers in @entity77 ( 8.12 ) and @entity78 ( 8.10 ) came in second and third place on the cleanliness scale			2
in @entity82 ( 7.42 ) the hotel guests were less satisfied			2
even though the hotels there have somewhat improved in comparison with the previous year ( 7.38 ) the city is still at the bottom of the list			1
the capital city with only 7.52 points does not cover itself in glory : both in national and international comparisons there is room for improvement			2

@entity123 , @entity124 : 7.71 10			0
@entity125 , @entity126 : 7.71 do n't let the bed bugs bite : if a guest finds the room to be not up to standard , @entity17 advises complaining at once and to the relevant person so what should you do if you find yourself in a grotty room ? according to @entity136 from @entity17 : ' should the room occupant actually find lipstick on the pillow or dirty mirrors in the bathroom and only risk using the shower with their shoes on , then the first step is to speak with the hotel staff or the local representative of their tour operator			1
the traveller should remain polite but firm and request that the shortcomings be corrected immediately or that they be permitted to move to another room			0
' most importantly the complaint should be made at once and to the relevant person			0
if the inadequacies can not be corrected locally and the dispute can not be resolved the complaint should be made in writing and accompanied with photographs			0
@entity162 7.97 best in the @entity74 : @entity73 topped the list for @entity74 cities with the cleanest hotels			1
