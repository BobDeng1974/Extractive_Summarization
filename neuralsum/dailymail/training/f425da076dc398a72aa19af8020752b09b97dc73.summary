by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:31 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 06:55 est , 7 november 2012 the traditional @entity3 civil service is being swept aside by massive spending cuts which have seen more officials fired in 18 months than in four years under @entity6 @entity3 mandarins claim spending cuts are going too fast and have been so severe that one department judges it a success that no member of staff has committed suicide			1
an extraordinary report into the civil service morale reveals the ‘ fragile ’ state some officials say they are in after the coalition successfully cut thousands of jobs in just 18 months			1
staff involved in making cuts have been threatened with ‘ physical violence ’ and one department ‘ viewed not having a staff suicide as a success measure ’ , according to the study by the @entity26 ( @entity27 ) think - tank			1
in just a year - and - a - half some 54,000 staff have been cut from the civil service , more than was achieved over four years under @entity6 in the 1980s			1
last year the efficiency programme saved more than £ 5billion , and with savings of £ 8billion expected this year rising to £ 20billion by 2015			0
the report warned that coalition government could lead to ‘ fragile leadership ’ , while any decline in staff engagement could make further change ‘ extremely difficult ’			0
‘ the experience so far has been draining for staff at all levels , it warned.motivating staff will be ‘ tough ’ with many ‘ seeing a bleaker future ’ than when they joined the civil service			0
the @entity27 said departments would struggle to make further cuts without ‘ radical new thinking ’ about the way @entity3 works			1
too little has been done about how ‘ how change makes staff feel ’ rather than just imposing ‘ logical ’ cuts , one official told researchers			0
‘ @entity3 is at a turning point ; the rapid pace of change to date belies a deeper fragility and challenges ahead , ’ said the report , entitled @entity3			1
‘ two out of three large change programmes fail to achieve their aims in the private sector and there are reasons to think @entity3 may fare worse			1
‘ most departments have struggled to find the capacity and capability required to lead departmental reorganisation on top of ministerial and other priorities			0
’ the report recommended giving more responsibility to officials below the highest ranks , in order to keep reform programmes on track in the case of changes at the top			0
report author @entity85 , said : ‘ our study shows 17 departments have approached their cuts in 17 different ways ; some with greater success than others			2
they are only part - way through and , with more cuts on the horizon , the stakes are high			2
‘ it 's important to take stock of what works and the major risks ahead			0
departments need to find effective ways of planning for the difficult choices and trade - offs they will face , beyond just immediate priorities			2
‘ it is essential that leaders throughout @entity3 work together more effectively across departmental boundaries to find the best options for savings and new ways of working			2
‘ and , with the danger of declining staff engagement , the onus is on leaders to ensure the motivation and capability is there to see them through			0
’ departments should find ways to work together to deliver savings , if it proves impossible to make more cuts solely within their own budgets			2
major changes in @entity3 are being overseen by cabinet office minister @entity128 and head of the civil service sir @entity131 a @entity133 spokesman said : ‘ in may 2010 , this government inherited the biggest budget deficit in the developed world			1
to ensure @entity137 can be in the future what it has been in the past , we are acting and taking difficult decisions			0
‘ that 's why we set up the @entity144 which is driving massive savings from departments and fundamentally changing the way @entity3 operates to improve efficiency through reforms and spending controls			1
‘ savings of this magnitude can not come by trimming budgets			0
that 's why we are working to transform @entity3 into a leaner , more efficient machine that manages its finances like the best - run businesses			1

more than 54,000 civil servants have been sacked in 18 months - more than @entity6 managed in four years
@entity26 warns @entity3 is in a ' fragile ' state and some departments might not cope with more cuts
