his outraged victims slammed the justice system in a statement after the pervert was handed a suspended sentence			1
they said : ' this sentence says you are allowed to go into a primary school and touch young girls and you will not be punished for it			2
' this shows everything that is wrong with the @entity14 justice system			1
he has had to live with this for two or three years , but the victims have had it hanging over them their whole lives			2
' @entity1 , who shook uncontrollably throughout the hearing , admitted touching three children while working at a south @entity58 primary school in the 1970s			1

she said : ' these were not specimens of a course of conduct , but actually single offences which you engaged against these girls			1
' it does seem to me that this is a case where the punishment has in effect already begun , in the effect this had on you , for the loss of your standing and the strain of waiting to find out what would happen			1

' she said mr @entity1 destroyed that place by what he did			2
since that incident , and over the years since she has felt unable to trust people in positions of authority			0
' accordingly , i have come to the conclusion that this is one of the cases where punishment may be tempered with mercy ' - judge @entity75 ' the impact of that breach of trust has dogged her for years , she says she does not trust easily , does not let people into her circle , and it has seriously affected her marriage and her relationship with her children			1
' she described two sets of allegations , the first in the 1970s , and the second in the 1990s and early 2000s			0
she said : ' the offences would not have occurred but for the position of trust held by the defendant as a gymnastics coach , which gave him access to the victims who were young and therefore vulnerable			2
' @entity1 was due to stand trial in september after pleading not guilty to a number of offences in april last year			2
however , the second set of allegations came to light after the victims read news reports of the pending court case and contacted police			0
@entity1 admitted eight of 17 charges against him , involving seven victims as young as six years old			1
in a probation report @entity1 backed down from his admissions , denying the touching was sexual and passing the blame onto his victims however in a probation report he backed down from his admissions , denying the touching was sexual and passing the blame onto his victims			1
his lawyer @entity190 said : ' he has had great difficulty coming to terms with the shame of what he has done , and this is demonstrated by what he has told the probation officer , trying to deny his actions , pass them off as inappropriate not sexual , and blame the victims			1
' but he said his client 's remorse was ' genuine ' , and asked the judge to ignore the comments in the report			0
sentencing him , the judge said : ' you were one of the most highly regarded gym coaches in this country and much of your life has been spent doing good to others in particular young people			0
' at the same time , for the seven young women , who at the time were primary school children who had come to you for coaching on the basis of your reputation and the work you had done , for them you were anything but a good influence			0
' it is clear that the effect of what you did has followed at the very least three of your victims throught their adult lives			2
' detective constable @entity225 , of the @entity226 , said : ' i was shocked at the sentence and i do n't think it will bring closure to the because i saw how upset they were			0
' we must pay tribute to @entity1 ’s victims who had the courage to come forward			1
' his abuse has affected them into their adult lives			0
