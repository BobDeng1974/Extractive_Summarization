it was a constant and haunting reminder of their young daughter ’s brutal murder			0
for two years , the parents of five - year - old @entity5 had driven past her killer ’s cottage knowing its four walls hid the final grisly secrets of her death			1
yesterday they watched as the bulldozers moved in to demolish the isolated property they dubbed the ‘ house from hell ’ – and said its destruction had finally set their little girl ’s spirit free			2
the 43 - year - old said : ‘ it is a relief that it is gone and april ’s spirit can now be free			1
‘ she was murdered there and in a brutal way – every time we see it , it ’s heartache for us			0
even driving on the main road near the village is difficult			0
‘ you go past and your head ultimately turns to that house			2
it brings back the horrible memories of what happened			0
it has opened my wounds up again			1
it ’s the house from hell			2
’ the family has long pleaded for the destruction of the rented three - bedroom cottage in @entity74 , @entity75 , which has lain empty since @entity40 ’s arrest			1
in an emotional message on @entity79 before the demolition , mrs @entity45 , of nearby @entity77 , wrote : ‘ april , i am counting the hours down until that house from hell is knocked down and your spirit can go free baby girl			1
’ yesterday she wrapped her arms around her daughter @entity31 , 18 , and son @entity29 , 11 , as they watched it reduced to rubble			0
emotional : the family said they thought of april as the walls of the cottage where she died were torn down @entity96 : the family held eachother as they walked towards the ' house from hell ' where april died all gone : the house where april died was completely destroyed this afternoon she said she did not want a memorial garden built in its place , adding : ‘ we want to remember the little girl who loved to make cakes , to sing and dance and jump in puddles , and to keep all the happy memories we have of her			1
’ instead , the family want the community to decide what should happen to the site of the cottage , which the @entity117 government bought from its owners for £ 149,000 – the same price they paid for it in 2008			2
april ’s father @entity28 said the demolition is ‘ one chapter closed ’ and said it would also stop ‘ unwanted guests ’ coming to look at the house or taking ghoulish souvenirs			1
he also praised the local community for their support , adding : ‘ i do n’t see how we could move anywhere else – if we start running , when do we stop ? ’ @entity40 is serving a whole life sentence for april ’s abduction and murder in 2012			1
cruel : april 's disappearance sparked the biggest search operation in @entity138 history , but @entity40 's attempts to hide his crime , carried out at home , meant her body has never been found safety first : builders have fenced off the white - washed cottage as it is razed to the ground killer : @entity5 , pictured , murdered april after snatching her and was convicted last year			1
he is one of only around 50 criminals in @entity138 jails given whole life terms the former abattoir worker is thought to have killed the girl inside the rented cottage after he snatched her from outside her family ’s home			1
traces of her blood and fragments of a child ’s skull were discovered inside the cottage , despite @entity40 ’s desperate attempts to clean up			1
he is then thought to have dumped her body , which has never been found despite a huge search operation – and he remains the only person who knows what happened inside the house or where her remains are hidden			2
during his trial , @entity40 claimed he knocked her over in his @entity176 and then ‘ forgot ’ what he did with her body			0
mrs @entity45 added yesterday : ‘ so far he has n’t said anything and i do n’t think he ever will			0
he has no hold over us			0
‘ he is there in those four walls and he can not come back out and hurt any of our family			0
’ the cottage , named @entity187 , joins a list of properties that have been destroyed because of their connection with horrific crimes – such as the @entity194 home of @entity195 and @entity196 in @entity197			2
@entity5 snatched april @entity198 and took her to his home where he murdered her - but when police found out he then came up with a series of bizarre and far - fetched excuses			1
april @entity198 's murderer was a serial offender with convictions relating to guns , thefts and road rage attacks , but bizarrely he tried to claim his violent past , dating back 28 years			1
@entity40 wanted his criminal record laid bare during his murder trial so the jury would get to know that he had never been in the dock for sexual offences or for having indecent images of children			0
taken in : @entity40 minutes after his arrest as he was taken in for questioning - the murder then began to spout a series of bizarre lies about what had happened to april this was despite the father of six having an obsession with child pornography , uncovered after police raided his home following april @entity198 ’s disappearance in october 2012			1
having first tried to hide his guilt by helping search for april , police pieced together that he was the prime suspect after his car @entity176 was seen near where she was taken			0
he then told police that he accidentally ran her over and meant to take her to hospital before ‘ blacking out ’ because of a combination of drink and panic			0
a forensic inspection of his car quickly proved this was a pack of lies			0
the police raided @entity40 's home and found he had tried to cover his tracks by trying to clean his house from top to bottom			2
he had washed his clothes , carpets and upholstery while local people were out searching for april , before placing air fresheners in the rooms and cranking up the heating to dry the rooms quicker			0
officers who searched the property said they were overwhelmed by the strong stench of bleach			0
shocking : april 's blood and bone fragments were found in the lounge of the house but her killer falsely claimed she had been hit by a car april 's blood had also been found in the bathroom - despite @entity40 's attempts to clean his house from top to bottom @entity278 blooded : @entity40 made a number of attempts to hide the murder , but a full forensic examination of his cottage revealed what he had done but despite this police found blood stains and fragments of april 's bones - although her remains were believed to have been thrown in the nearby river			1
the blood stains had a ' one in a billion ' match to april 's dna profile were found near the wood burning stove , on the carpet and on the sofa			1
april ’s blood was found in his living room , hallway , the bathroom door , washing machine door and the shower curtain , the court heard			2
once police confronted @entity40 about the child skull bones in his fireplace he said that they were from a chicken supper he cooked for his children			0
blood under the carpet at his home was because he placed april in front of the fire to keep her warm , he said , as part of his lies about hitting her with a car			2
his then told detectives the child pornography on his computer was because he wanted to track the physical development of his own children .			0
