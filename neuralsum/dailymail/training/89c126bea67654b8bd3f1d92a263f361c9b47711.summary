anyone who ’s ever been stuck on a train must have thought this at least once : maybe it would be quicker on foot			0
@entity5 did more than just wonder – he got up and ran like the clappers			2
in a daredevil challenge of man versus machine , the 30 - year - old @entity8 touch - rugby player burst out through the train ’s open doors , sprinted fearlessly up flights of steps and belted through city streets in an attempt to beat it to the next stop			0
footage from the @entity26 camera on his head shows him running up the station 's stairs the race is on : @entity26 footage shows mr @entity5 running through the streets towards @entity34 station , where he makes it to the carriage ( pictured right ) just moments before the doors close somewhere beneath him , the @entity39 train he had just abandoned at @entity40 had already begun to clatter and trundle its way eastwards on the @entity42 , unhindered , and running perfectly on schedule			1
had this been a @entity48 movie , our hero would have been billed as ‘ faster than a speeding train … ’ mr @entity5 , however , had yet to cross the finish line			1
but what ’s this ? above ground at @entity55 , a panting young environmental consultant from @entity57 , dressed in shorts and running gear , comes skidding through the ticket barrier at high speed			2
he swipes his @entity63 to get through			0
he leaps down the steps so fast he almost tumbles into the wall			0
in the carriage he vacated one stop earlier , all eyes are now on the platform entrance as the train doors are about to close			2
waiting : mr @entity5 is seen standing behind closed doors as the tube carriage leaves @entity74 station first obstacle : footage taken on a @entity26 camera shows him rushing through the first set of ticket barriers leaving the station : before he bounds up the stairs that lead from @entity40 station to the street sprint : a map shows the route mr @entity5 took between @entity40 and @entity55 stations and then he appears ! with a dramatic , triumphant lunge , he hurls himself back into the carriage – cheered and applauded by the same passengers who had watched him depart			1
@entity91 accomplished … with less than two seconds to spare			0
now his race @entity39 video , filmed on a miniature camera strapped to his head , is becoming a favourite on @entity96 and a talking point among weary underground travellers across the network			1
mr @entity5 completed the 415 - yard , platform to platform sprint in 1min 18secs			1
he clocked up an average speed approaching 11mph , on a route that included having to negotiate two ticket barriers and scale or descend 75 steps			0
the train took 1min 20secs to travel along 339 yards of track , timed from the moment its doors closed at @entity40 and opened at @entity55			1
footage inside the carriage was taken on a second camera operated by his friend @entity23			1
video from @entity117 on the street : another friend films mr @entity5 as he sprints between the two stations in the @entity121 clock is ticking : mr @entity5 races down one street before setting his sights on the tube station last leg : with the station just feet in front of him , mr @entity5 keeps up the pace as he continues the sprint destination : video taken by a camera attached to mr @entity5 's head shows him running into @entity55 ‘ at first the other people on the train did n’t really know what was going on , ’ he said			1
‘ i did get a few suspicious looks , although to be fair , i was wearing sportswear with a camera strapped to my head			2
i belted out as soon as the doors opened and @entity23 explained to the carriage what we were trying to achieve			2
after that , they were all waiting on tenterhooks			0
’ his spectacular re-entry to the carriage provoked delight and admiration – and secured a dozen or so impartial witnesses to verify his feat , should he ever need them			0
mr @entity5 was inspired to tackle the ultimately pointless challenge by others who had completed similar quests on @entity158 transport networks			1
he often uses the tube to get to work but confesses he is not a huge fan			0
‘ sometimes i just run , ’ he said			0
final push : tension mounts after mr @entity5 enters @entity34 station and leaps down the stairs anxious : passengers inside the carriage can be seen waiting for mr @entity5 to reappear at @entity55 desperate : film taken from mr @entity5 's camera shows his view of the waiting carriage as he runs nearly there : passengers are waiting on tenterhooks as they wait to see whether he will make it made it ! mr @entity5 collapses on the floor after running onto the carriage - seconds before the doors closed			1

@entity5 raced between @entity40 and @entity55
he filmed his 415 yard sprint on a @entity26 camera attached to his head
his friend @entity23 recorded footage from inside the carriage
mr @entity5 completed the *incredible* stunt in just *80* seconds
