' the house of father - of - 22 @entity9 : his most recent offspring is just seven - months - old , while he claims his eldest is 39 @entity141 @entity140 , where a judge decided to suspend @entity30 's jail sentence so he could look after his youngest child he claimed to be in debt – but his baby son was playing with an @entity147 when a reporter visited this week			1

@entity30 then abandoned his story , choosing not to give evidence in support of it			2
in mitigation , @entity174 said @entity30 had ‘ a number of medicinal conditions ’ including breathing problems , back pains and frequent chest infections which would make any time in prison difficult			2
