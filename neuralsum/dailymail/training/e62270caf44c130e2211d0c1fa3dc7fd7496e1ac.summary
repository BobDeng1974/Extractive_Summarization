‘ that ’s the worst thing ever because you have nowhere to go			0
at the moment i do n’t know whether we should play at home or whether we should play away			2
‘ at least you know i am going to be having the majority of opposition fans booing me ( at @entity40 in their next game ) rather than our own fans booing me			2
' and i am not just talking about me , i am speaking on behalf of all the players			0
‘ i think it might be better to play away from home at the moment because at least we know beforehand we are guaranteed to be booed because they want their home club to win			0
‘ but when you are playing at home and your own fans start booing you after a few minutes then it is harder			0
' ' i just merely suggested that it would be more positive if they got behind the team more , ' @entity0 tweeted on tuesday evening			2
' i love the club as do all the players in the dressing room			0
' we would all do anything to make this team win but like most people we respond better to praise than criticism			1
' we will get this right			0
please bear with us and we will improve			0
