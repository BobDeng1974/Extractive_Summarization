taxpayer deal : the company behind new stealth cameras being installed on @entity4 's busiest roads is being paid £ 2.1million by the government the business behind new ' stealth ' speed cameras being installed across @entity4 is being paid £ 2.1million by the taxpayer to help catch more drivers , it was revealed today			1
the controversial devices have caught almost 700 drivers in just two months and unlike traditional yellow speed cameras , they are painted grey , making them harder to spot			1
the technology has been introduced to catch drivers breaking the 70mph speed limit on the @entity18 in @entity19			1
and the same technology is being introduced on a northern section of the @entity18 and also parts of the @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			1
today it emerged that @entity28 agreed a £ 2.1million deal with the government to set up the system			1
the @entity32 confirmed to @entity33 they pay £ 150,000 per site to install the equipment and £ 25,000 per site per year to maintain the equipment			0
the company 's @entity4 boss @entity38 last night refused to comment on whether the cameras are unfair on motorists			1
but he did tell @entity42 : ' i work for the company who do the technology for the cameras			1
i have no comment '			0
the cameras , called the @entity50 , enforce variable speed limits on motorways when they are congested			2
but when the speed limit at 70mph they are not switched off , instead they then catch people breaking the limit			1
front and rear - facing cameras are used to verify a vehicle ’s speed			2
and , while conventional devices have to be trained on only one lane at a time , the digital cameras can scan four			0
motoring groups claim the devices will see thousands of drivers facing at least £ 100 in fines and points on their licence for straying marginally over the 70mph limit			1
uproar : the cameras , pictured on the @entity18 , were believed to be just enforcing variable speed limits but they are actually doing the 70mph limit too the grey cameras are being installed across @entity4 's busiest motorways can track dozens cars across four lanes in the heaviest of traffic			1
conventional cameras can only scan one lane and are usually painted yellow - but these are grey			1
attached to the motorway gangway - front and rear - facing cameras are used to verify a vehicle 's speed			2
the same camera system is also used to grab the vehicle 's number plate and match it up with the national vehicle registration database			0
they enforce variable speed limits and also the standard 70mph speed limit if needed			1
the @entity94 recommends drivers are not charged unless they exceed 79mph in a 70mph limit zone			2
@entity97 , one of the founder members of the @entity99 , said they did not believe targeting drivers on the motorways was the best way to improve safety and that punishing drivers for exceeding the 70mph limit was often unnecessary			2
' the 70mph limit is not a speed that a lot of people bother to observe any more , ' he said			2
' it was originally brought in as an experiment and was made permanent without any real testing			0
it was brought in at a time when the stopping power of cars was a bit like stopping an oil tanker , and the maximum speed of most cars was 74mph			0
we 've moved on now , some 50 years later we have cars that stop much more quickly			0
' the amount of traffic that exceeds the 70mph limit is enormous			2
most people are driving at 80mph on motorways , and these are our safest roads in the country			0
' mr @entity97 said he did not think using speed cameras on the @entity18 was appropriate because there are many times , particularly late at night or when there is little traffic , when it is safe to driver faster than 70mph			1
he also said these should be made more visible , rather than disguised to try and catch drivers out			1
in 2013 the number of people fined for speeding peaked at more than 115,000 - the highest level since 2009			0
ministers said the rise was largely due to the increased number of speed cameras that were in operation for 24 hours a day			1
in total 115,549 motorists were fined more than £ 100 that year			2
it was also announced last year that the maximum fines for motorway speeding that could be imposed by magistrates would rise from £ 2,500 to £ 10,000			0
in 2012 - 13 the government collected £ 284million in speeding fines			0
where the new cameras will be placed : several stretches of road are being upgraded to become ' smart motorways ' , with new speed cameras a part of improvements			1
above , a map detailing which will be affected @entity162 , managing director of the @entity163 , said he was ' shocked ' officials had decided to use this type of speeding enforcement			0
he said : ' this is a another missed opportunity			0
the @entity32 is introducing so called " smart motorways " but relying on dumb enforcement			0
it is policing by numbers , by remote control '			0
studies have shown that nine out of ten drivers admit to breaking the motorway speed limit			1
the government had planned to raise the limit to 80mph before the proposals were shelved by transport secretary @entity179 two years ago			0
brake , the road safety group , has previously said that raising the speed limit would cause more accidents and deaths on motorways			1
the first cameras were installed between junctions five and six of the @entity18			1
@entity19 police figures showed that 668 speeding offences were logged in just over two months			2
until now , cameras have mainly been used to keep drivers below 50mph in sections of the network undergoing roadworks			0
in the two months since they have been installed on the @entity18 , pictured , almost 700 drivers have been caught breaking the 70mph limit the @entity32 said signs warning about speed cameras should be displayed on every gantry of the motorway where they are used			1
a spokesman said : ' variable speed limits on smart motorways are primarily there to smooth traffic flow , reduce congestion and make journeys more reliable			0
' hundreds of thousands of motorists use this stretch of the @entity18 every day			2
the vast majority are sticking to the speed limits and are experiencing better journeys as a result of smart motorways			0
' there are clear signs where cameras are in place and the new cameras are more visible than the previous versions			0

a new *generation* of speed cameras being introduced on the @entity18 in @entity19
