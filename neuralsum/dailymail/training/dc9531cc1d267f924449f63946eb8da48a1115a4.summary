by @entity0 @entity1 was hit with a two - match ban for his bizarre diving headbutt on @entity5 striker @entity4 in the pre-season friendly at @entity7			1
the @entity10 - @entity9 centre - back will sit out monday 's @entity11 tie with @entity12 at @entity13 and sunday ’s @entity15 opener against @entity16 for his moment of madness in saturday ’s 2 - 0 defeat by the @entity15 side			1
@entity21 had been all but resigned to referee @entity22 including the astonishing red card in a formal report			1
that was promptly filed with the @entity26 , who immediately forwarded it to their disciplinary counterparts in @entity5			2
@entity1 ’s dismissal in @entity7 was his third during 2014 and raised questions about his future at @entity21			1
off you go : @entity1 was hit with a two - match ban for his bizarre diving headbutt on @entity7 's @entity4 however , @entity37 has no plans to offload him and will instead try to help the 27 - year - old calm his destructive temper			1
the @entity21 boss held talks with @entity1 on sunday and insisted he was n’t tempted to cash in after @entity44 - based outfit @entity43 saw an offer rejected earlier this summer			1
speaking before the ban was confirmed , @entity37 said : ‘ i do n’t think we are in a position to get rid of players who will definitely be big parts of our season unless there is an automatic replacement who is better			1
‘ we speak about @entity57 ’s downside but he and @entity58 scored in the region of 30 goals for us last season			2
that is from centre - back , so it ’s a reasonable return			2
‘ but there is a problem and it ’s one we are working to resolve			0
it is something that @entity57 has had throughout his career			0
he knows he would be a far better player if he can get rid of it			2
‘ whether it is count to 10 or walk away , it is something he is going to have to do			0
‘ this is the third time he has been sent off ( at @entity21 )			1
i thought he was unlucky with the first one against @entity79 last season , but the other two were just flashes where he lost it			0
i 'm staying put ! it is understood that @entity21 boss @entity37 still wants to keep hold of his defender ‘ the upsetting thing is that he is a really nice boy , great with the kids and supporters			1
but there is that flaw within him			0
’ asked if a psychologist could be enlisted , @entity37 added : ‘ i ’m not sure			1
i ’m not qualified enough in that department to know if that would work or if he ’d want it			0
what i do know is that he accepts totally he was wrong and let the boys down			0
we want to work to eradicate that problem			0
’ @entity103 midfielder @entity102 will also be absent tonight after @entity37 revealed he is currently stranded in @entity104 dealing with visa issues			1
@entity102 was given extra time off this summer after he was forced to withdraw from his country ’s @entity108 squad with a thigh injury			0
‘ the mystery that is @entity102 is definitely coming back — but when he is coming back , sadly , i ca n’t give you a definite on , ’ added @entity37			2
‘ he has been in @entity104 trying to sort a visa and , if you are going to have problems , then i ’d suggest @entity104 is the place to have them			0
‘ the good news is that @entity102 is fit — the health issues are long gone			0
it ’s just location issues now			0

central defender was sent off in the defeat at @entity125 on saturday
@entity1 has previous when it comes to on - field *indiscretions*
but @entity21 *manager* @entity37 does *n't* want to sell the player
