a soldier who became infertile after being injured by a bomb in @entity2 launched a bitter attack on the @entity4 last night after ‘ heartless ’ officials rejected his bid for a @entity8 sperm bank			1
former soldier @entity9 served fourteen years in the @entity10 until he stepped on an @entity11 in @entity2 , losing his legs and sexual function			1
he wants the @entity4 to fund a sperm bank in case other military personnel end up like him sergeant @entity9 , 35 , began a campaign for the @entity4 to store samples provided by soldiers after a @entity21 landmine blew him up in 2010 , causing appalling injuries and leading to the loss of both of his legs			1
@entity27 ’s injuries prevent him from having children or a sex life , and led to the break - up of his marriage – he and his fiancee @entity32 went ahead with their wedding after the blast only for the realities of his condition to drive them apart			2
the soldier , from @entity39 , said : ‘ this is devastating news			2
' i fear that , as a result of the @entity4 ’s decision , more soldiers will be denied the pleasure of fathering children			1
‘ many can not afford the cost of storing their sperm privately			0
' others may take their fertility for granted			0
‘ the @entity4 has enough medical facilities to incorporate a sperm bank			1
' i know what it is like to feel that you ’re not a man any more			0
' a guy ca n’t feel much worse than that , and i would n’t wish that on anyone			0
‘ the @entity4 has let soldiers down in a bid to save money , it is heartless			1
’ almost a quarter of soldiers in the @entity67 are unfit to fight on the front line , according to official figures			2
some 18,460 troops out of the @entity67 ’s current strength of 84,600 are unable to fulfil their duties due to injuries sustained in battle or in training , or other long - term health problems			2
last night , colonel @entity77 , who led @entity79 troops in @entity2 , said : ‘ such a small fighting strength puts us in the world ’s third division of armies			0
’ since @entity79 troops began fighting the @entity21 in @entity2 in 2001 , 7,222 personnel have been admitted to @entity79 - run field hospitals in the country and a further 7,088 have been flown back to @entity79 for treatment			0
from those totals , 610 personnel have been listed as seriously wounded			0
a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ the vast majority of soldiers who are not fit to go on operations have only temporarily been downgraded and will still be able to deploy once they recover			2
‘ anyone who is unable to deploy still plays a vital role supporting operations and defence priorities			0
’ the @entity4 said that its decision was based on the ‘ extremely low ’ number of service personnel who are infertile because of their wounds – 24 @entity79 troops are unable to have children naturally for this reason			1
it would have to pay hundreds of pounds to store soldiers ’ sperm at private clinics , with prices starting at £ 300 for freezing and a year ’s storage			1
female troops wishing to preserve egg cells face higher costs			0
solicitor @entity116 also attacked the @entity4 ’s decision , saying : ‘ the government ’s lack of commitment to assisting these seriously injured soldiers is hugely disappointing			2
' the least they could do is allow these men the gift to father children post-injury , which would cost so little given the happiness this would bring			1
’ sperm banks proved popular in @entity129 after the 1973 @entity130 and were used by widows of soldiers belonging to the @entity133			0
he @entity4 ’s announcement comes after a woman won a @entity137 victory last month to stop her dead husband ’s frozen sperm being destroyed			2
@entity140 , 28 , successfully challenged the time limit for the storage of sperm set by the @entity79 ’s fertility regulator			0
an @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ because the number of service personnel suffering from serious groin injuries is extremely low , there are no current plans to introduce a system to store sperm or ova pre-deployment			1
for @entity154 : sgt @entity9 from @entity39 , @entity155 lost both of his legs when he stepped on an @entity11 whilst serving in @entity158 ‘ however , advice is available for all personnel and we would encourage anyone interested in finding out more to speak to their chain of command			1
’ although the @entity4 has refused to set up a sperm bank , the @entity67 has improved the design of garments worn by troops to protect them			1
the multi-tiered pelvic protection system was introduced in @entity2 in 2010			0
troops who sustain a groin injury are given full access to fertility preservation services on their return to the @entity79 , if required , to reduce the risk of post-traumatic infertility .			0

sgt @entity9 , 35 , from @entity39 served 14 years in @entity67 before stepping on an ied in @entity158
lost both legs and sexual function ; married fiancee but split soon after
@entity4 says no need for facility because so few personnel are *affected*
24 soldiers are unable to father children because of *war* wounds
*collecting* and freezing sperm and storing for a year costs from £ 300
