@entity0 looks ahead to sunday night ’s @entity2 showdown between the @entity3 and @entity4			1
the @entity4 are top of the @entity2 with four wins from their opening five games this season , but the @entity3 draw level with their rivals with victory at @entity12 on sunday			1
when i saw that @entity14 was covering this game , it brought back real fond memories of what the @entity17 to me is all about			1
this is one of the hardest and toughest rivalries that the league has to offer			0
the @entity3 and @entity4 are pretty much neighbours in terms of states			1
it is a bitter rivalry that is on par with @entity27 against @entity28			1
over the years the @entity3 always seemed to come out on top when the likes of @entity31 and @entity32 were playing and @entity33 was their head coach			2
the @entity4 had @entity34 who , little did we know then , subliminally reinvented the quarterback position if you look at the quarterbacks we have now that can run and throw like @entity41 and @entity42 @entity43 's @entity3 take on the @entity4 with a chance to go joint top of the @entity2 @entity46 has been below - par with five interceptions so far this season and a banged up offensive line @entity50 at @entity51 , 6pm @entity52 at @entity53 , 6pm @entity54 at @entity55 , 6pm @entity56 at @entity57 , 6pm @entity58 at @entity59 , 6pm @entity60 at @entity61 , 6pm @entity62 at @entity63 , 6pm @entity64 at @entity65 , 6pm @entity66 at @entity67 , 9.05pm @entity68 at @entity69 , 9.25pm @entity70 at @entity71 , 9.25pm @entity72 at @entity73 , 9.25pm @entity3 at @entity74 , 1.30am at the moment , it is all much of a muchness in the @entity2			1
the rivalries within the @entity2 are epic and this is always an exciting division			2
it ’s a shame the @entity80 ca n’t get up and running , but this division could be won by any one of the @entity4 , @entity82 and @entity3			1
i think it ’s going to be even - steven all the way and whoever comes third might even have a shot at a @entity89 spot			0
@entity43 has been on fire in the last few games for the @entity3			1
he started the season a bit shaky and everyone was talking about him being prone to interceptions			0
but in the last two games he has scored more than 30 points in each game			0
his favourite target is his tight end @entity100 , which is interesting because the @entity3 very rarely use their tight ends			1
but , having said that , @entity103 is on form now as well and @entity105 is coming into the frame too			0
@entity43 has got his haters			2
he is a bit like @entity109 in the sense that you either like him or you loathe him			0
but he ’s a proven @entity113 winner			0
he has won more @entity113 than his brother even though @entity115 is smashing records			0
there is only one statistic that really matters in the @entity17 - how many @entity113 rings you are wearing			2
@entity34 during his time as quarterback of the @entity4 in 1990 @entity122 celebrates a touchdown for the @entity3 in their win over the @entity125 unfortunately for the @entity3 , their running back @entity126 is injured for this game			1
but they have another running back in @entity122 stepping up			0
he is a big , powerful running back who can take the hits			0
on the flip side , the @entity4 defense is not the best			2
they ’ve allowed more than 400 yards per game , which is pretty shocking			0
their secondary is pretty flaky as well and if @entity103 , @entity100 and @entity105 can get going for the @entity3 then it is going to be a high - scoring game			1
with the @entity4 offense , everyone talked about @entity140 coming into the league with his spread formation and quick tempo			2
that seems to have slowed down now			0
@entity145 has left and @entity46 is at the helm , but he needs a good game against the @entity3			1
he has an opportunity to really open up this @entity150 secondary , but the problem is that his offensive line is pretty banged up			1
for this offense to work , he needs time to release the ball			0
last year he only had two interceptions but he has had five already this season			0
i think that comes down to the fact that his offensive line is pretty banged up			2
@entity103 ( right ) and @entity162 ( centre ) celebrate a touchdown for the @entity3 running back @entity165 moved to @entity74 from the @entity166 at running back , @entity165 is so small and fast and he makes it tough for the big defensive guys up front			1
@entity171 does n’t need any introduction because he has proven that he is one of the best running backs in the @entity17			2
it depends on whether the offensive line for the @entity4 is up to holding back the @entity3 defensive line			1
that is what this game will come down to because they have both got a shaky secondary			0
@entity0 presents @entity17 : the @entity183 , mondays at 11.45pm on @entity14			0
this sunday night @entity14 will broadcast live coverage of the @entity3 at the @entity4 .			1

@entity3 take on @entity4 in sunday night game
eagles lead the way in @entity2 with four wins from five in 2014 season
@entity82 also 4 - 1 with @entity3 one game back at 3 - 2 in tight division
*giants* against @entity4 is a bitter rivalry and one of my favourite in the @entity17
@entity43 has been on fire , and can take *advantage* of @entity4 ’ defense
@entity74 offensive line must allow quarterback @entity46 to perform
