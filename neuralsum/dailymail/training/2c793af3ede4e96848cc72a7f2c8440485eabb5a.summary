cooking writer @entity0 has declared it is time to welcome it back into our kitchens for years veal has been shunned by restaurants and retailers , cast aside as a cruel and unethical meat			1
but cooking writer @entity0 has declared it is time to welcome it back into our kitchens - and claims it is a vital part of sustainable farming			1
‘ thank @entity14 , ’ she wrote yesterday			0
‘ @entity16 chops are my best thing and i want to stop feeling bad about that			2
’ @entity20 - author of the @entity22 ’s @entity21 - suggested that using young bulls for meat is a way to sustain organic farms			1
‘ if we want milk , butter and cream , we need to eat the unproductive bull calves , ’ she wrote in her @entity28 column			0
@entity16 meat comes from the male calves of cows bred for dairy , slaughtered when they are a few months old			1
the meat was rejected by many @entity41 consumers in the 1980s , when campaigners revealed they were fed formula milk and kept out of sunlight to keep their meat white and tender			1
since then farmers have instead sold the young calves abroad or shot them at birth			2
they can not be bred for beef , because adult dairy bulls are felt not to make good meat			2
but many think that it is time to embrace veal once more			2
they say that times have changed since the sight of tiny veal crates turned consumers off the pale meat 30 years ago			1
@entity16 crates were outlawed in the @entity41 in 1990 and @entity41 organic farmers now follow strict welfare guidelines			1
high - welfare veal - also known as ‘ rose ’ or ‘ pink ’ veal - was introduced to the market several years ago , but it has had little success because many still consider all veal to be inhumane			1
miss @entity70 , 74 , argues that veal is a way to keep organic farms going			0
‘ what cheered me is the news that pasture fed meat is good for you , ’ she wrote			0
miss @entity70 features in @entity81 's @entity80 with @entity82 and @entity83 ( right ) ‘ yes , it costs a bit more than that pale , tasteless , tough stuff , but according to recent research it is higher in beneficial fats and antioxidants than factory farmed meat			0
‘ besides , if we are ever to give up chemical fertilisers , we ’ll need animals to fertilise the land : no animals = more artificial fertiliser			0
’ young veal bulls are a byproduct of the dairy industry			1
to keep a dairy cow producing milk , she has to calve regularly			0
if the calf is a female , it is added to the dairy herd			0
some male calves are kept as breeding studs , but if they are not used for meat , there is no use for the remainder			1
miss @entity70 ’s intervention last night was met with delight by farmers			0
a spokesman for the @entity119 said : ‘ the @entity119 fully supports any initiative that increases the value of dairy bull calves to the @entity41 dairy farmer			0
‘ rearing male calves from the dairy herd for either beef or veal in this country makes a lot more sense than exporting them for someone else to add value to them			1
’ ‘ @entity41 dairy farmers have long been frustrated by the @entity41 consumers ’ reluctance to buy welfare - friendly rose - veal so anything that encourages the public to go out and purchase it has to be supported			1
’ others insisted that customers can only be sure that @entity41 veal is ethical – with imported veal subjected to a far less rigorous standard			0
@entity150 , the popular breadcrumb coated cutlet of veal , is a traditional @entity151 dish and is extremely popular in @entity152 @entity153 said : ‘ calves reared for veal outside @entity41 are likely to have been exported long distances and reared in barren conditions without bedding			0
‘ welfare in the @entity41 is higher - rearing these male dairy calves for veal in the @entity41 prevents them from being shot at birth as they are unwanted by the dairy industry			1
we ask anyone who eats veal to choose @entity41			0
’ @entity167 , policy director of the @entity169 organic movement , added : ‘ we agree veal is a good solution but we would encourage people to eat pink veal - where the calves have been raised humanly on a natural diet			1
’ ‘ if organic farmers ca n’t use their calves for veal , we encourage them to sell them to someone that can - but they must comply with our transport standard			2
’ but the @entity182 last night dismissed all veal as unethical			2
a @entity182 spokesman said : ‘ calves are forcibly removed from their mothers when they ’re only a few days old			2
‘ the terrified , lonely babies may be purposely fed a diet low in iron so that they become anaemic and their flesh remains pale			0
‘ by the time they ’re sent to be killed , many of these infants are so weak that they can barely walk up the ramp to the abattoir			0
’ the best - selling author 's intervention has been met with delight by farmers he added : ‘ if @entity0 wants to stop feeling bad about veal chops , then the logical solution would be to stop consuming dairy products			1
‘ it is the demand for milk that drives the veal industry			0

@entity16 comes from male cow calves slaughtered at just a few months old
meat rejected by many consumers in 1980s *due* to poor treatment of animals
now @entity0 is encouraging people to embrace welfare - friendly rose - veal
the author believes using young bulls for meat is *economically* necessary
but animal group @entity182 is *fiercely* against the product
