@entity9 , 35 , took three 17th century @entity11 vases while excavating earth for the @entity14 shopping centre in @entity15 , @entity16 in 2008			1
but @entity9 , who was employed by the @entity17 to work on the dig , was caught when another archaeologist found the vessels , which date back to 1650 , for sale on @entity7 last year			1
historic find : @entity24 @entity23 of @entity25 , left , returns two stolen 17 century vases to @entity27 from the @entity28 in @entity15			2
@entity9 admitted stealing them from an archaeological dig in 2008 stolen : the vases , which date back to 1650 , were stolen from an archaeological dig ahead of work on a new shopping centre in @entity16 he was given a four month suspended sentence and ordered to carry out 270 hours of community service at @entity38 after admitting the thefts			1
the court had heard that @entity9 had a history of stealing historical artefacts from digs and had been jailed for a similar crime for 15 months in 2001			1
this time around he was spared a custodial sentence after the court heard that he was no longer working as an archaeologist and had been dealing with illness and the death of his parents			0
@entity25 pcs @entity23 and @entity52 worked alongside the @entity17 to identify the vases and where they came from			1
police eventually carried out a raid on @entity9 's @entity59 narrowboat home and he was arrested , @entity38 heard			2
@entity60 , prosecuting , said the crime ' cast suspicion over other archaeologists ' and led to the loss of potentially significant historical evidence			0
the two pcs at the centre of the investigation have since presented two of the recovered vases to museum archaeologist @entity70 and @entity28 manager @entity27			0
back in safe hands : @entity70 from the @entity17 ( far left ) and @entity27 from the roman baths ( second right ) , gratefully receive the vases from pcs @entity23 and @entity52 the third vase is to follow			2
after further examination in @entity78 the vases will eventually be returned to the @entity79			0
the vases , also known as @entity82 jugs , were traditionally used to protect against witchcraft			0
they originated particularly from the @entity86 region of modern @entity87			0
they were often decorated with a bearded face mask on the lower neck and came in a variety of sizes			0
they are named @entity11 vases after catholic cardinal @entity96 who was a fierce opponent of @entity98 in @entity87 and the low countries			1
it is unclear why his name became associated with the vases , but it may be connected to his anti-alcohol stance as the jugs were often used to store drink			0
@entity28 manager @entity27 said : ' these vases are very important to us because we do n't have many objects and artefacts from medieval @entity15 that give us a better picture of that period in the city 's history			2

they had been found while he worked on an excavation dig in @entity16
