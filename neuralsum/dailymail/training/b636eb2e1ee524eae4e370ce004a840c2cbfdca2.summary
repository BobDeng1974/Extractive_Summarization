@entity0 again covered every blade of grass in the midfield battle click here for your ultimate stats guide from the game their shoulders were sunk , their faces long			2
this was supposed to be the day when @entity12 hosted its biggest party for 24 years but ultimately it became the setting for a wake			0
no matter that @entity17 signed off an impressive campaign with the runners - up spot after beating @entity20 ; the emptiness of falling short of the ultimate dream as @entity0 , @entity23 strolled around @entity12 was palpable			1
for @entity25 , however , this was no time for despondency			0
gloom had descended following the results against @entity30 and @entity31 that fatally damaged their title aspirations but , to lift the mood in the dressing room , @entity17 's manager took his squad back to the first day of the campaign			1
before that opening contest against @entity37 , he read out a letter that had been sent to him by a supporter			0
not this year : skipper @entity0 is left to reflect as @entity17 missed out on the @entity41 title so near , yet so far : @entity42 was the match - winner but @entity44 were crowned champions support : manager @entity25 salutes @entity17 's fans after full - time appreciation : @entity0 applauds the @entity12 crowd during the post-game lap of honour volley good : @entity54 levels for @entity17 midway through the second half @entity56 's the man : @entity42 stole in to give @entity17 a 2 - 1 lead putting the boot in : @entity59 celebrates @entity17 's winning goal but it was n't enough to see them take the title @entity17 ( 4 - 1 - 3 - 2 ) : @entity63 7 : @entity64 6.5 , @entity65 6.5 , @entity54 7.5 , @entity66 6.5 ( @entity67 46min 6.5 ) : gerrard 7.5 : @entity68 7.5 , @entity69 6 ( @entity70 59mins 6.5 ) , sterling 8 : @entity42 6.5 ( @entity72 80mins 6 ) , @entity59 7			1
unused : @entity73 ( @entity74 ) , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity72 @entity20 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) : @entity78 7 : @entity79 6 ( @entity80 73min ) , @entity81 7 , @entity82 7 , @entity83 7 : @entity84 6 , @entity85 6 ( @entity86 82mins ) , @entity87 7 , @entity88 7.5 : @entity89 7 : @entity90 6			1
unused : @entity91 ( gk ) , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity80 , @entity94 , @entity95 goals : @entity65 ( o.g 20 ) , @entity54 ( 64 ) , @entity42 ( 65 ) booked : @entity84 , @entity88 , @entity72 sent - off : @entity90 , @entity86 , referee : @entity98 attendance : 44,724 @entity100 : @entity101 ratings by @entity103 at @entity12 the fan , named @entity105 , explained about his pride in @entity17 and his faith that this could be a memorable season			1
sensing the need to put into perspective what they have achieved , @entity25 felt the need to provide his group with a reminder			0
' he told us not to just think about fourth ( place ) but think about winning ( the title ) , ' said @entity25 , taking up the story			2
' at the time , probably the staff and the players thought it was a bit far - fetched			2
but i truly believed we could progress and ( before the @entity20 match ) i read the same letter back again			1
' all the words that went back into the players ' minds were the same as the beginning of the season			0
now the word that comes from this is belief			0
we will get better next season and we will be able to fight again as we have got belief			0
' it will be difficult to see images of @entity44 with the trophy they covet so much but once the frustration subsides over the coming weeks and months , @entity17 will be able to reflect on a campaign that has given them a base to attack the top on a regular basis			1
though they had to work hard for victory here , coming from behind to snatch the points with goals from two @entity151 , @entity54 and @entity42 , they dazzled for long periods and taking 37 points from the last 42 available is clear evidence they are capable of championship - winning consistency			1
mending the wobbly defence is a prerequisite when the transfer window opens - @entity20 , with more poise , could have had this contest wrapped up before half - time - but should @entity25 do that , @entity17 will continue to be a threat			1
' we will get better , ' @entity25 insisted			0
' the style will be enhanced and improved			0
the philosophy here is very much based on attacking creative play			0
we just need to be better and more concentrated when we are winning other games			0
but there will be no fear			0
' ow no ! @entity65 puts through his own goal to give @entity20 an early lead now what we had planned : @entity65 ( right ) can not hide his despair following the first - half concession silver service : newcastle celebrate their unlikely opener in the 20th minute frustration : @entity54 rues a missed chance as @entity17 tried to find an equaliser realisation : @entity17 fans react to news that @entity44 had taken the lead against @entity187 no goal : @entity59 had a first - half effort disallowed by @entity98 , who had not seen the striker 's quick free - kick so close : @entity59 shows his frustration as @entity17 's title hopes faded his words were as impressive as the show of support that came before the game			1
as has become the habit , @entity17 's fans lined @entity12 with flags and let off flares to greet the team bus			1
inside the stadium , the club dj provided a soundtrack with hits from their glorious past			0
there was even a rendition of ' bubbles ' to show that @entity213 allegiances on this day were also with @entity187 , who needed to provide the ultimate favour and beat @entity44 if @entity17 were to win their 19th title			1
in reality , the fairytale scenario never threatened to come true			0
@entity17 were scruffy in the opening 45 minutes			1
@entity20 , by contrast , showed plenty of fight and spirit and deservedly took the lead when @entity65 horribly sliced @entity88 's cross past @entity63 in the 20th minute			1
that was the 12th goal @entity17 had conceded in the last six matches and it nearly became 13 when @entity88 skipped clear but succeeded only in shooting straight at @entity227 after @entity90 had split @entity17 's defence open			1
expectations at that point deflated like a punctured balloon			0
' we could n't have ended the season in that way , ' @entity25 said			0
' we needed to put that behind us			0
' to their credit , @entity17 's response was impressive			1
full of energy and movement , they began pressing and @entity20 were powerless to prevent themselves being pushed back deeper and deeper			2
clash : @entity86 was sent off following a challenge which felled @entity59 on the run : @entity69 tries to get away from @entity20 's @entity89 @entity101 again provided evidence ofwhy he should be included in @entity245 with an energetic display thatcaused @entity20 problems and showed howmuch he has progressed in the second half ofseason			1
@entity42 also made his markwith the winning goal			1
he was quiet in the firsthalf but improved and was given a standingovation when substituted			0
@entity64 didnothing to harm his position as first - choiceright back , and @entity0 and @entity254 were solid			2
@entity255 , meanwhile , will be relieved to @entity256 end the campaign unscathed			0
parity was secured in the 64th minute when , after foul by @entity260 on @entity101 , @entity0 swung a deep free - kick beyond the far post to @entity54 , who divert the ball back past @entity78 ; 60 seconds later , an identical set piece from another cheap foul presented @entity42 with the chance to win the game			1
from that point , @entity20 lost their discipline			2
@entity90 was sent off for persistent dissent - a decision by referee @entity98 that left @entity273 perplexed - and he was followed by substitute @entity86 , who went in late on @entity59			1
' the referee could have managed the game better , ' @entity273 observed			2
' we had a good game plan and played well but @entity17 have been fantastic			2
we have n't been good enough in the second half of the season but we will come back stronger			0
' @entity25 echoed with the last part of that statement , maintaining @entity17 ' will be better ' ; if they are true to his word , the dream may yet be fulfilled			2
the boss men : @entity273 and @entity25 exchange a handshake before the game			2

@entity17 miss out on @entity41 title after @entity44 win 2 - 0 at home to @entity187
@entity65 own goal was reversed by strikes from @entity54 and @entity42
@entity20 had @entity90 and @entity86 sent off
@entity273 's side slipped to 10th following their sixth defeat in seven matches
