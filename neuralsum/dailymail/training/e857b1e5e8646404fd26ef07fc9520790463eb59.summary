@entity0 brought @entity1 to its feet by surviving a full frontal assault from mercurial @entity6 @entity5 to reach the semi-finals of the @entity8			1
@entity0 fought off two match points in the fourth set before going on to win 4 - 6 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 7 - 5 , 6 - 2 in three hours and a half hours against the no 20 seed , who could not quite find adequate composure when he had the @entity15 master at his mercy			1
sometimes swilling @entity17 at the changeovers , as is his habit , the coach-less @entity5 could not convert two match points when he led 6 - 5 and had his opponent serving at 15 - 40 in the fourth set			1
he was reminded of the time - honoured lesson that you do not let @entity0 wriggle free without paying for it			0
the hard - headed professionalism of @entity0 and enduring combative instincts won through in the end , and now he meets the @entity51 @entity50 for a place in the final			2
the first two sets had been a wretched display from the @entity15 , now past his 33rd birthday , but he fought back by charging into the net repeatedly in a manner that will have had his coach @entity59 purring with delight			0
at full stretch : @entity0 gets across the court to return to @entity5 pushed all the way : @entity5 struggled to deal with @entity0 in the last three sets after missing the two match points @entity5 served a couple of double faults in the next game to be broken , and he clearly could not get the disappointment off his mind			1
the fifth set became predictable procession as the @entity6 collapsed , just as he did in the deciding set of his quarter final against @entity74 at the same stage of the @entity76 , with @entity0 taking just 27 minutes to wrap it up			2
fightback : @entity0 never gave up despite losing the first two sets beaten man : @entity5 lies on the court after losing a point to @entity0 @entity0 said : ' it 's just unbelievable to win matches like this at slams			2
i have won other big ones in other places			0
but over best of five , saving match points against @entity5 in an atmosphere that it was out here , it 's definitely very special			1
' it was the ninth time in 33 - year - old @entity0 's career that he has come back from two sets down to win			2
@entity0 said : ' it would have been an unbelievable letdown for me to get broken at 5 - 4 [ in the fourth set ] and lose a match like that			1
it would have been not very cool			0
fan club : former @entity6 international @entity105 was in the stands to watch @entity0 against @entity5 all smiles : @entity105 sits behind @entity0 's wife @entity108 and coach @entity59 ball girl : skier @entity110 fights for a ball hit by @entity0 into the crowd after his win having a laugh : @entity116 ' girlfriend @entity110 enjoyed her trip to the @entity8 ' i knew i could play better after the first couple of sets			1
i believed i could turn it around from the get - go when the third set started and i 'm so happy the crowd got into it			0
' the rallies were incredible at times and my game really picked up			0
i served great in the fifth when it mattered			0
' @entity131 v @entity5 highlights			0

@entity0 *fightsback* from two sets down to beat @entity5
@entity5 missed two match points in the fourth set
@entity0 will play @entity51 's @entity50 in the semi-final
