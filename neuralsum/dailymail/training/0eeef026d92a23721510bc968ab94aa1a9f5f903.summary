when a couple are considering their honeymoon destination - an escape to the @entity4 or a romantic weekend in @entity5 normally come to mind			2
but this @entity8 pair have shunned tradition of luxury and will instead spend seven months living out of an rv visiting every @entity13 state			1
@entity14 and @entity15 , both 23 , got married on may 24 , and embarked on a seven - month , 50 - state road trip - including plane rides to @entity18 and @entity19			1
trip of a lifetime : @entity14 and @entity15 who have lived in @entity8 all of their lives decided to go on the 50 - state , seven - month road trip starting at their wedding in may			1
they take selfies at every state line happily married : the pair have been travelling for five months and living out of a rv			1
they hope to have their journey completed by @entity36 the pair , who have lived in @entity8 all of their lives have packed up everything into the 29 - foot vehicle have named @entity41 and will live out of it until @entity36			1
so far they have visited 35 states and are five months into their journey			0
every time the couple passes a state line , they stop and take what has become an obligatory selfie in front of each sign			1
to fund their trip , they asked their wedding guests to donate on their @entity58 page			2
after quitting their jobs , they then reached out to @entity61 , proposing they would film a documentary and blog about hourly workers they met along the way			2
now in each state , mr @entity15 spends a day in a part - time job			1
so far he has been a yoga instructor in @entity69 , a baker in @entity71 and an apple - picker in @entity73			2
all of the videos of the experience are showcased on @entity76			0
@entity14 told @entity77 : ' we 've covered about 16,000 miles in five months			1
that 's probably been the hardest part			0
we are always on the move			0
pure @entity82 : to fund their trip , the couple ask guests at their wedding to donate to their @entity58 page and then received sponsorship from a job site day out : one of their stops in @entity93 included a visit to @entity95 , the home of the @entity96 ' fortunately , we travel with our home , so we rarely feel homesick or like we do n't have a home base			1
unfortunately , our home is a 20 year old rv			0
something breaks every week ( at least ) and we are constantly needing to make a trip to a mechanic or learning how to fix things ourselves			2
' the best part is that we experience every moment of life together			0
perhaps some people say that they would get tired of another person by then -- and certainly we get tired of each other sometimes -- but we love being together			0
' we experience every break down and every tough work day together because we are a team			0
' we 're just two kids who are madly in love and crazy enough to jump into the world 's most stressful honeymoon together			0
one of the lastest tweets he uploaded was : ' my last job at an @entity121 in @entity73			2
it was beautiful , and i ate 12 apple cider donuts			0
' next stop : the pair took one of their obligatory selfies when they reached the state - @entity93 causing a splash : one of their selfies was taken with @entity133 in the background fields of opportunities : mr and mrs @entity138 donned sunglasses as they made their way into @entity141 the pair 's blog reads : ' we quit our full time gigs in order to seek out adventure and pursue a career in writing and creative endeavors			1
my current adventure is a quest to work a different hourly wage job in all 50 states			1
' we are pretty young compared to your average @entity156			0
at 23 years old , we get a lot of strange looks from other full - timers			1
they look at us with questioning glances as we hide away in the back of rv parks and try to find decent wifi			0
however , it â€™s part of the lifestyle we chose to live			0
' our mission is to live a life that always challenges the status quo			0
while all of our friends are gathering mortgages and settling down , we bought a used rv off @entity175 and hit the road			2
view of the ocean : @entity15 looks out over the @entity179 during a stop in @entity181 , @entity182 hitting the links : while parked up in @entity185 , @entity71 , they decided to play pitch and putt as they geared up for the next leg of the journey family ties : they met up with @entity15 's long lost sister ( middle ) at a diner in @entity195 , @entity196			1

@entity14 and @entity15 , both 23 , got married on may 24
they then embarked on a seven - month road trip covering every state
the pair , both from @entity8 , are aiming to finish their *voyage* at @entity36
mr @entity15 will also take on an hourly job in every location
his wife also *insists* that they take a selfie when they reach every state
