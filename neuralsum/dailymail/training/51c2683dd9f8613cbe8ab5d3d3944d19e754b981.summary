@entity2 should stop complaining about @entity4 migrants and build them more housing and infrastructure , a leading @entity1 bureaucrat declared last night			1
@entity4 commissioner @entity7 said that the @entity2 is ‘ taking advantage ’ of @entity10 migrants who provide ‘ economic and financial benefits ’			1
rather than complaining about the pressure migrants put on housing and public services , he said , ministers should just spend more money to accommodate them			0
@entity22 mp @entity21 accused mr @entity7 of ‘ staggering complacency ’			2
he said : ‘ the pressure on infrastructure from the number of immigrants coming to our shores is more than many communities can cope with			0
we have schools having to accommodate pupils who do n’t speak @entity34 , gp lists which are oversubscribed and huge pressure on public transport and other facilities			0
‘ this all needs to be paid for and is an extra burden on taxpayers			0
it also increasingly makes people feel we are not living in @entity2 as we would like it to be – and people want their country back , and that means some control over numbers coming to the @entity2			0
’ in an article for the @entity52 website , mr @entity7 said that free movement of people through the @entity10 is a ‘ huge benefit ’ to the workers themselves but also helps employers solve ‘ labour shortages and skills gaps ’			1
the @entity61 economist said @entity10 workers ‘ usually ’ pay more in tax and welfare contributions than they receive in benefits and so are ‘ net contributors to the @entity2 exchequer ’			1
he added : ‘ as a result , @entity2 workers have to pay less tax than they would in the absence of workers from other @entity10 countries			1
’ mr @entity7 said that he accepts there are ‘ some challenges ’ resulting from migration but claimed the risk of benefit abuse is ‘ minimal ’			2
he said : ‘ in countries with significant incoming migration , there can be problems when there is a large , sudden influx of people from other @entity10 countries in to particular towns or areas , putting a strain on schools , housing , healthcare and infrastructure			2
‘ but the answer to these problems is to invest in new facilities , housing and services , not to turn away people that are working hard and more than paying their share into the @entity2 ’s budget			2
‘ the @entity2 authorities should listen to people where these problems arise , and be prepared to invest in new infrastructure and services to address these problems , rather than simply take advantage of the economic and financial benefits of workers coming from other @entity10 countries			1
’ in november last year mr @entity7 also sparked fury by claiming that @entity2 risked becoming the ‘ nasty country of @entity4 ’			1
he said @entity114 plans to curb benefits for migrants fuelled hysteria and might even scupper the single market			0
but he was immediately slapped down by home secretary @entity119 , who said that his comments show @entity1 is increasingly ‘ on the wrong side of the argument ’			0
mr @entity7 , who earns £ 212,000 per year as @entity123 for employment , social affairs and inclusion , also said that existing rules were already strong enough to combat ‘ so - called benefit tourism ’			0
however , critics have pointed to @entity61 ’s own @entity130 which has called for the expulsion of @entity61 gypsies			0
@entity134 mp @entity133 has said that mr @entity7 should ‘ sort out his own backyard ’ before criticising the @entity2 .			1

@entity10 commissioner for jobs said migration from *eastern* @entity4 good for @entity2
@entity7 said *foreigners* pay more in tax than they get in benefits
@entity61 *official* said answer to strain on services was more investment
a report by @entity152 last night pointed to ‘ rapid ***population*** ***growth*** ’ in @entity2 as a reason why living *standards* are *falling* . however , it said that a growing ***population*** may actually be ‘ necessary for economic ***growth*** ’ and that the shift towards dominance of the service sector in the economy means that even stronger ***population*** ***growth*** is needed to keep the economy growing .
