by @entity1 reporter last updated at 10:50 pm on 26th december 2011 the breast implant health scandal spread to @entity3 yesterday , with 1,000 women there warned to see their doctors			1
it was revealed that the @entity14 @entity13 , or @entity15 , implants at the centre of the scare , which has affected 40,000 @entity12 women and 300,000 worldwide , had been sold under a different name in @entity3			1
@entity18 healthcare authority spokesman @entity17 said : ‘ we estimate that some 1,000 women in the @entity18 have those implants			1
’ burst : plastic surgeon @entity23 holding defective silicone gel breast implants , which were removed from a patient @entity15 – once the third - largest maker of breast implants in the world – stands accused of using industrial - grade silicone in some of its implants			2
there are fears that the implants , which were sold around the world , could cause health problems if they burst or leak			2
in @entity3 , the @entity15 implants were sold under the name m - implants , and the fact that they were rebranded has sparked fears that more women could be affected than originally thought			1
m - implants and @entity15 - labelled implants were banned in @entity3 in march 2010			1
while the @entity14 government has urged the 30,000 women in @entity14 with @entity15 implants to have them removed – and offered to pay for the surgery – other countries , including @entity12 , have only gone as far as saying that women should visit their surgeons for checks			2
@entity54 's @entity53 have now opened a special hotline to provide medical advice after it was believed that products made by the defunct company @entity58 could be linked to increased cancer risk			1
it is estimated that 850 women in @entity54 have the @entity15 implants , some of the cheapest available , representing 5 per cent of the total number who have undergone the cosmetic procedure			1
concerns about their safety first surfaced 18 months ago , when surgeons noticed they were rupturing much more quickly than other brands			2
the @entity14 health watchdog ordered an inquiry , which subsequently reported ‘ serious irregularities ’ in the implants and they were pulled off the market			0
manufacturers were accused of fraudulently using a non-approved silicone gel for almost 10 years which believed to have been originally designed for mattresses			0
threat : @entity81 quality ' implants contain industrial silicone - designed for computers and electronic devices - instead of medical - grade fillers they have a higher than normal rupture rate – up to five per cent among @entity14 women – and have been linked to the death of a @entity14 woman from a rare form of cancer called anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( @entity95 ) , and implicated in at least seven other cancer cases			0
it has also emerged many of the implants were missing a protective coating designed to stop them from splitting and prevent any gel that leaked from spreading through the body			0
it was feared that leaked gel could trigger cancer but to date tests have remained inconclusive			0
the @entity54 @entity53 hotline has already dealt with around 1,000 concerned patients over the weekend			1
the hotline information indicates that @entity15 implant procedures were not conducted in public hospitals but more common at private medical centers			1
about 300,000 @entity15 implants , which are used in cosmetic surgery to enhance breast size or replace lost breast tissue , were sold worldwide before the company went into administration last year			0
@entity15 implant procedures have now been banned in @entity54			1
up to now , there have been very few reported cases of the removal of ruptured implants in the @entity124 , and no reports have circulated about new cases of leakage in recent weeks			2
@entity128 , director of the @entity129 ( @entity129 ) supported moves to reassure women			0
she said ‘ we are pleased to see that health and regulatory experts from the @entity18 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 have all confirmed no evidence of any increase in incidents of cancer associated with @entity15 breast implants and no evidence of any disproportionate rupture rates			0
‘ @entity14 are looking increasingly isolated in their stance and their pre-emptive statements have caused unnecessary alarm			0
‘ our advice is that anyone concerned about their breast implants should contact their gp or implanting surgeon			0

@entity54 hotline prompted by @entity169 's *decision* to cover cost of implant removal
