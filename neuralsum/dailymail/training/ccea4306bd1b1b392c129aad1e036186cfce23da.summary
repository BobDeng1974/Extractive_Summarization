ovarian cancer patient @entity0 , 58 , from @entity1 after eight rounds of gruelling chemotherapy over seven years , ovarian cancer patient @entity0 is still holding out for a cure			1
@entity0 , 58 , a former sales administrator , was first diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2007 but the cancer has since spread to her lungs , liver , kidneys and bowel			1
two weeks ago , she was told that the last type of chemotherapy available to her had stopped working			2
' i 'm running out of options , ' says @entity0 , who lives in @entity17 , @entity1 , with her husband , @entity18 , 56 , a civil engineer			1
' the gaps between treatment cycles were getting shorter and shorter as the cancer keeps returning			2
' her hopes are pinned on a groundbreaking new trial combining two cancer drugs to target blood supply to tumours , destroying them , then stopping them from regrowing			1
the two drugs , which have not been used together before , are fosbretabulin and pazopanib			0
@entity31 is one of a class of drugs known as a vascular disruptive agent ( @entity35 ) and destroys the blood cells supplying existing cancer cells			2
pazopanib , which is licensed for kidney cancer , prevents the development of new blood vessels			2
@entity0 's consultant , professor @entity42 of the @entity43 , in @entity44 , one of the experts leading the trial , says he is ' very optimistic ' about the outcome			1
' the blood supply is the achilles heel of a tumour ; if you can shut that down they will shrink and be destroyed , ' says professor @entity42 , who for 30 years has worked on drugs that attack blood vessels that supply tumours			2
' @entity31 has been around since 1998 and was developed from chemicals extracted from @entity60 bush willow bark			0
we know it is highly effective at destroying the blood supply to tumours			0
' however , professor @entity42 says the drug on its own is not enough to stop the cancer coming back , as some cells on the rim of the tumour survive and are able to develop a new blood supply , getting nutrients from surrounding healthy tissue			1
this means the tumour grows back , usually within months			0
' we can treat women with ovarian cancer who relapse five or six times - the first period of remission is typically a year or more - but each time they relapse the period of remission get shorter			1
some individuals survive for many more cycles of treatment - the record is 22			0
' eventually though , as in @entity0 's case , the drugs stop working			1
' we have been searching for another drug to use with fosbretabulin , to stop cancer cells growing a new blood supply , for several years			1
' an earlier small trial we did using it in conjunction with @entity97 , a drug that works in a similar way to pazopanib , was successful and we have been trying to get a larger randomised , controlled trial running for some time			1
' she has had eight rounds of gruelling chemotherapy and is still holding out for a cure experts believe that pazopanib will work even better than @entity97 , and has the advantage of being taken as a pill ( @entity97 is given intravenously )			1
@entity0 , who has three children and two grandchildren , hopes to start treatment this month in the first phase of the new trial			1
the aim is to find the optimum dose and what side - effects the combination produces			0
a further 17 patients will be recruited at @entity43 , the @entity121 in @entity122 and the @entity123 in @entity124			0
phase two , involving 120 patients , will start recruiting in 2015 , comparing the combination treatment with pazopanib alone			0
' i 'm still optimistic about that magic pill , ' says @entity0 , who has already been on four previous drugs trials			2
it 's hoped the new drug combination will improve survival rates for ovarian cancer in the same way new drug therapies have done for breast cancer			1
despite being the second most common gynaecological cancer , with 7,000 women diagnosed every year , the survival rate for ovarian cancer is still low			1
only 42.9 per cent of women with the disease are alive after five years - compared with 85 per cent with breast cancer			2
experts say this is partly because the majority of ovarian cancer cases are diagnosed only when patients have symptoms when the cancer has spread			1
however , treatment options are also more limited			0
@entity0 was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in march 2007 after she started to feel full after a few mouthfuls of food - a key symptom of the disease			1
others are nausea , persistent bloating and abdominal pain			0
' i felt like i 'd eaten a seven - course meal but usually i 'd only eaten half a plateful , ' she says			0
at first , @entity0 thought it was her irritable bowel syndrome ( @entity165 ) flaring up			2
it was a nurse performing a routine cervical smear test a year after @entity0 's symptoms began who urged her to see a doctor			2
' i mentioned that i 'd been experiencing pain during sex recently and she suggested i see my gp			0
' @entity0 's doctor noted her right ovary was enlarged and said it might be a cyst			2
blood tests also showed raised levels of something called @entity180 , a marker for ovarian cancer , ' though i did n't know that at the time ' , she says			1
she was then sent for an ultrasound scan , which confirmed there was a growth			0
she was told she needed surgery to investigate			0
' the nurse in the room put her arm on my shoulder , but still no one mentioned the word cancer , ' recalls @entity0			1
' it 's bought me this precious extra time ' ' so when the surgeon i was referred to warned me that all the signs pointed to ovarian cancer , the news really shocked me			1
i was just 50 and had never had any serious health problems before			0
but i tried to stay positive			0
' @entity200 confirmed it was cancer			2
@entity0 had tumours on her right and left ovary			2
although the cancer had n't spread beyond the womb , the tumour looked aggressive , so the surgeon removed her womb and ovaries			2
she then underwent four - and - a - half months of chemotherapy			0
@entity0 went into remission for three years			1
' i went back to work and had a completely normal life - i hoped i was one of the lucky ones who had been cured			0
' but in august 2010 , @entity0 developed pain in her left side - the cancer had returned , this time in her pelvis			1
' it was obviously devastating but the doctors were so calm that i just got on with it , ' she says			0
the cancer was controlled with the hormone treatment tamoxifen as well as regular scans and blood tests to monitor it , before @entity0 moved on to her second bout of chemotherapy in july 2011			1
she has since had six more rounds			0
late last year , @entity0 took part in a trial of a new drug that could potentially make her responsive again to carboplatin , one of the main chemotherapy drugs , as it had stopped working for her			1
' my lowest point came last @entity238 when i was on the trial drug plus two other chemotherapy drugs , ' she recalls			1
' i had to spend @entity238 in bed in hospital as i was so ill. ' the trial drug worked , though , and made me respond to carboplatin again			1
by february , i felt much better , and in may we had a holiday in @entity246			0
' sadly , that treatment has stopped working again , and @entity0 was switched to another chemotherapy regimen			1
two weeks ago , she was told that drug had also failed			0
' people wonder why i have persevered with chemotherapy for so long because it obviously has side - effects , which have made me extremely ill at times			2
' she adds : ' but it 's bought me this precious extra time and i 've made the most of it - going on holiday , seeing my daughter and younger son marry and my grandchildren born			0
' i 'm amazed that however black things might look , my specialists always have a plan for the next step and something else we can try			0
because of them , i 've never given up hope			0
' even if this trial drug combination does n't work for me i hope the research will help other women with ovarian cancer and other cancer patients			1
for me , that means it has to be worth a shot			0
' commenting on the new trial , @entity279 , chief executive at the charity @entity281 , says : ' ovarian cancer remains an incredibly difficult disease to cure			1
sadly , we lose 4,800 women to the disease each year			0
we sincerely hope this trial is successful and that it provides some long - awaited hope for women and their loved ones			0
