by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd the season has n't even started yet and the world is already talking about the latest @entity4 and @entity5 spat			2
but this time the @entity8 club were n't even involved - in fact , the bad feelings came about in a pre-season match involving real and a former @entity4 star			0
@entity13 's @entity12 refused to shake @entity15 defender @entity14 's hand and threw a water bottle at him - all before the kick - off of a friendly ! flashpoint : @entity12 ( second left ) withdraws his hand from @entity14 's reach ( fourth left ) as he walks down the line of @entity5 players chill : a team - mate tries to calm the @entity26 midfielder down but judging by his behaviour later it did n't work ... impact : @entity12 's team - mates try to pull him away ( bottom centre ) after @entity5 players take issue with his actions , but he goes a step further ouch : @entity12 's thrown bottle skims off the side of @entity14 's head ( top right ) , spraying him with water taunt : @entity14 ( second right ) smirks back at @entity12 ( bottom ) after that bottle falls to the floor behind him it was also claimed that @entity14 had spat at @entity12 at some point during proceedings but that does not seem to have been caught on camera			1
the came about ahead of the @entity13 's 1 - 0 win over the @entity53 champions on wednesday morning in the @entity54 in @entity55			2
@entity14 and @entity12 have had their battles down the years in @entity59 games and those ill feelings seemed to come to a head			1
the pair have history : @entity12 accused @entity14 of calling him a monkey during a @entity66 clash in 2011			1
history : @entity12 and @entity14 are n't the best of friends - with the former once accusing the latter of racism this time , after the @entity26 man refused to shake his opponent 's hand in the pre-match pleasantries the pair had to be separated by team mates , with @entity78 and @entity79 acting as chief peace - makers			1
but that was n't all - the 34 - year - old midfielder then decided it was a wise idea to throw a bottle of water at the notorious @entity5 hard man 's head			1
fortunately the usually hot - headed @entity14 appeared to laugh it off - but the fourth official claimed he had spat at his counterpart at some point during the scuffle , although it was bizarrely not deemed worthy of a red card			1
angry : @entity12 still seems to be wound up as he takes issue with @entity5 's @entity96 after the incident it 's only a friendly ! @entity99 and @entity79 take issue with the former @entity4 player 's behaviour victory : @entity13 veteran @entity104 later scored the only goal as the @entity106 ran out narrow winners in february 2012 , @entity108 refused to shake the hand of @entity111 defender @entity110 after being found guilty by the @entity112 and banned for eight matches for racially abusing the @entity114 the previous october			1
@entity110 offered his hand but the @entity117 star , then of @entity118 , ignored it ( below ) and moved on down the line of @entity111 players			0
this sparked off even more controversy and prompted sir @entity123 to call @entity108 ' a disgrace '			0
a month earlier , in january 2012 , the @entity125 took the unprecedented step of cancelling the pre-match handshakes between @entity128 and @entity129 in the wake of the @entity133 - @entity132 affair			0
@entity133 had been banned for four matches and fined for racially abusing @entity132 the previous november and the @entity125 decided to dispense with the handshakes to avoid embarrassment			0
that was not the first time @entity133 had been involved in a handshake gate			0
his former friend and team - mate @entity139 refused the @entity128 captain 's hand on live tv in 2010 ( below ) over @entity133 's affair with @entity139 's ex-girlfriend			2
and it is not just confined to these shores			0
last season , in @entity150 , @entity149 striker @entity148 refused @entity153 's handshake after the @entity154 forward started dating @entity148 's ex-wife , and moved in with her .			0

@entity26 midfielder played for @entity4 for four years until 2012
it looked like the @entity59 **rivalry** reared its head on @entity13 's @entity163
@entity12 refused to shake @entity14 's hand during the pre match pleasantries
he then *lobbed* a bottle at the tough defender - before the game started !
fourth official claimed @entity14 had spat at the 34 - year - old
@entity12 said he turned down @entity5 to join their fierce rivals @entity4
he accused @entity14 of calling him a monkey during a clash in 2011
@entity59 games have turned ugly in recent years as **rivalry** hots up
