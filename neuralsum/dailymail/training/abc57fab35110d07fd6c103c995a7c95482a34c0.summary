flowers may be used to show someone you care , but it ’s unlikely many people would appreciate receiving this floral behemoth			0
the @entity7 arum is the world ’s largest , smelliest flower and after two years of waiting , a specimen at the @entity11 in @entity12 has finally bloomed			2
the 9ft 3in - tall ( 2.8 metre ) plant is only expected to live for the next 48 hours - and just missed out on breaking the project 's @entity7 record by 3.5 inches			1
the @entity7 arum is the world 's largest , smelliest flower and a specimen at @entity12 's @entity11 , pictured with expert @entity19 , bloomed earlier today			1
the 9ft 3in - tall ( 2.8 metre ) plant is only expected to live for the next 48 hours - and just missed out on breaking the project 's @entity7 record by just 3.5 inches the @entity22 is native to @entity23 and is a distant relative of the @entity25 called ' @entity26 '			1
when it is ready to be pollinated the giant flower heats up , giving off the smell that is a mixture of dimethyl disulphide and dimethyl trisulphide			0
this pungent smell is similar to the stench produced by rotting bodies , and as a result the plant is also known as the ' corpse flower '			0

as big as it is , the @entity11 's specimen has some way to go until threatens the world record for tallest @entity22 , which belongs to a 10ft ( 3.1 - metre ) mammoth grown in @entity47 in 2010			1
according to gardeners at the attraction , near @entity51 in @entity12 , the plant was growing at a rate of between six and eight inches ( 15cm and 20cm ) a day earlier this week			2
they had expected it to flower either over the weekend or early next week - almost a year to the day since the last one bloomed - but it arrived early			0
it is the ninth @entity7 to flower at @entity11 , but is the first one to bloom twice			1
@entity7 arums normally live for between seven and 10 years before flowering for as little as 48 hours and then dying			2

in 2011 , it claimed the title of @entity11 's biggest ever @entity7 , measuring 9ft 6.5in ( 2.9 metres ) at its tallest			1
