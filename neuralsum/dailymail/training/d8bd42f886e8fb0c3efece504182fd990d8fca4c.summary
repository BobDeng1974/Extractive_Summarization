some fisherman will do anything to catch a big one but when it means wading into waist - deep , crocodile - infested waters you have to wonder if it 's actually worth it			2
onlookers were left dumbfounded by the behaviour of a man , who spent ' at least 15 minutes ' in the water at @entity11 on the @entity12 in the @entity13			1
@entity14 was there fishing nearby and photographed the man in the water			1
he said that at the time there was a four - and - half - foot crocodile floating within 50 metres of where the man was fishing			2
' it was one of the most dangerous things i 've seen happen for years			0
the man just pulled up in a car with his mates and trotted off to the other side , ' @entity14 , 45 , said			2
' then he waded in up to his waist and started fishing even though there were four or five crocs in and around him			0
' but it 's not the first time i 've seen it happen			0
it did n't worry him at all			0
people are willing to take a chance so that they can catch some good barramundi			0
' the man was fishing for barramundi and took no notice of the crocodiles around him mr @entity14 had been fishing from the bank before the man arrived and caught 15 barramundi before the man started out into the water			1
' he was in there for at least 15 minutes			1
when he was out in the water you could n't even have shouted to him to warn him that a crocodile was coming because the river was rushing so strongly			2
i 'll never know how he did n't get eaten , ' he said			0
it 's believed that the man was from @entity69 mr @entity14 said , and that he had fished in the area before for barramundi			1
initially the fisherman just stood off the shore in shallow water as he fished ' i 've seen a lot of silly stuff with people going out and doing exactly the same thing as this man			1
but the thing is 20 years ago there was n't as many crocodiles around			0
there 's a bigger population of crocodiles now , ' mr @entity14 said			1
' a lot of people get taken and it 's all because of stupidity			0
it can happen as quick as a wink , so if you get into the water up to your chest like this you would n't even see one coming			0
' there 'd be absolutely nothing you could do about it			0
he may have done this before , but the way he 's going he wo n't be doing it for much longer			1
' @entity14 shows off a 98cm barramundi he caught just before the mystery man stepped into the river			1

a man spent ' at least 15 minutes ' in the water filled with crocodiles at @entity11 on the @entity12
@entity14 was there fishing nearby and photographed the fisherman in the water
the spot is known for its barramundi fishing and the man had fished there before
' he may have done this before , but the way he 's going he wo n't be doing it for much longer , ' says @entity14
