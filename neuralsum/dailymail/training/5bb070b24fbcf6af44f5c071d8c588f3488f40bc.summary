by @entity0 nine months after the shutdown gave government workers an unexpected 16 days off , birth rates in the @entity3 area have soared			1
with parks closed and dismal october weather keeping many workers indoors , those affected by the shutdown were forced to seek simpler methods to keep themselves amused - the results of which are clearly now bearing fruit			0
the shutdown itself - which lasted from october 1 to october 16 - took place after the @entity19 - dominated @entity18 failed to pass their @entity20 for 2014 in protest at the @entity26 president 's radical ' @entity24 ' overhaul of the healthcare system			0
nothing else to do : nine months after the shutdown gave government workers an unexpected 16 days off and closed numerous attractions ( pictued ) birth rates in the @entity3 area have soared with 850,000 employees affected , a total of 6.6million working days were lost as a result of last year 's government shutdown - the longest in @entity26 history			1
the cost to the @entity26 economy is estimated to be £ 2.2billion			0
but perhaps the most surprising impact of the 16 day break is a dramatic increase in the birth rate in the @entity3 area			1
@entity43 in @entity3 , has seen an additional three births per day in july , according to spokesman @entity45			2
' we ’re at near - capacity right now , ' @entity45 told @entity48 , joking that some furloughed workers ' apparently found ways to amuse themselves			0
' meanwhile @entity51 in nearby @entity52 delivered almost 100 more babies in the april , may and june than they did in the same period last year , according to spokeswoman @entity54			2
rising numbers : @entity43 in @entity3 ( pictured ) , has seen an additional three births per day in july , according to the official staff spokesman @entity45 no entry : with 850,000 employees affected , a total of 6.6million working days were lost as a result of last year 's government shutdown - the longest in @entity26 history ' how long until someone on television points out that during the shutdown the folks in @entity3 are apparently doing at home what @entity3 has been accused of doing to the @entity26 people ? ' anchor @entity63 joked during @entity71 's @entity70			1
there is a great deal of debate over whether or not events like the shutdown do lead to a spike in births			0
while some sceptics say pregnancies are so random that any given hospital can have a single birth one day and 20 the next , others are convinced there is a link			2
dr @entity85 , @entity48 ’ senior medical contributor and a practicing obstetrician said : ' i can say that i 've definitely seen spikes after things like hurricanes , blackouts and blizzards			0

but perhaps the most surprising impact of the 16 day break is a dramatic increase in the birth rate ' i ’m not aware of any hard data on this , but anecdotally , many obstetricians will ask their patients about the events nine months prior , and many women will say ' yes , we conceived during the blackout ' , ' she added			1
