battle : @entity12 , 51 , started claiming benefits when she split from @entity13 , 45 , an international haulage contractor , in 2010			1
above , the former couple pictured outside @entity30 's @entity11 today this means that mrs @entity12 is able to continue collecting payments - including child benefit , child tax credit and income support - until a decision is made			1
today , a lawyer for mr @entity13 told the @entity11 in @entity30 that the ruling was unfair and had failed to take into account his ex-wife 's potential to earn a wage			2
he added that mrs @entity12 , who continues to live in the former marital home in @entity44 , @entity45 , has a pension worth £ 70,000 while mr @entity13 does not have one			1
the couple married in 1992 and had three sons , now aged 14 , 16 and 20 , together before the relationship collapsed			0
mrs @entity12 was plunged into depression by the split , the court heard			2
a divorce judged ruled that mrs @entity12 should be given ownership over their five - bedroom home in @entity44 , @entity45 , as well as ' @entity57 ' - their holiday home in @entity8			1
she was also handed the endowment policy , while mr @entity13 was ordered to make maintenance payments indefinitely			1
ruling : a judge ruled mrs @entity12 should be given the £ 1.3million home in @entity45 , pictured , their holiday villa in @entity8 and an endowment worth £ 16,000			1
mr @entity13 also ordered to pay £ 800 - a - month in maintenance @entity68 , representing mr @entity13 , told @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 today that the division of the marital assets was ' grossly unequal '			1
' the husband 's share was worth £ 97,000			0
he claimed debts of £ 126,000 , ' he told the court			0
' the judge did not make any findings that the husband has undisclosed assets , whether specifically or by drawing adverse inferences			0
' such a grossly unequal distribution was not explained and is therefore plainly wrong			0
' the judge awarded the wife the former matrimonial home , a holiday villa in turkey , an endowment policy worth £ 16,000			1

mr @entity68 added that , under the judge 's order , ' the husband was left with his half share in two industrial units in @entity119 , @entity45 ' from 20 years of work and marriage			2
the court also heard arguments that the judge had no right to include the former matrimonial home as part of the ' pot ' for division between the warring ex-couple			0
that was because the house had been transferred to a @entity135 - based company and trust in 1999 , ' for tax reasons ' , the judges were told			0
@entity138 , representing the two overseas entities , argued the divorce judge was wrong to reach behind the corporate veil			0

outside court , mrs @entity12 's lawyers said that her benefits had not been affected by the orders for maintenance and division of property , as they could not be enforced pending the outcome of her ex-husband 's appeal			2
they confirmed that mrs @entity12 ' is in receipt of a number of benefits , including child benefit , child tax credit and income support ' and that ' she obtained them post-separation			2
