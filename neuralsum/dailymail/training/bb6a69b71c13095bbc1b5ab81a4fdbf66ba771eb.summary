@entity0 was still smoldering this morning after a night of rage that left large part of the city in flames or ruins			1
at least two dozen businesses were torched during the night of chaos leaving one entire block looking like a warzone			1
at the corner of @entity14 and @entity15 a strip of seven shops had been ransacked or burned down			1
prime beauty on the corner had completely collapsed on itself and fires were still burning inside the building			1
burned shops can be seen at the right of the picture , while a police roadblock in the front closes access to the ' crime scene '			1
still smoldering : the remains of a series of burned - out shops were still smoking on @entity14 today razed : one of the worst sites of destruction was at the intersection of @entity14 , @entity0 's main thoroughfare , and @entity41 , where an entire strip of seven shops was attacked , with @entity16 destroyed completely aftermath : a firefighter at work at @entity16 in the early hours of this morning immediately after it was set ablaze after - and before : @entity16 this morning ( left ) and as it was as before @entity0 was engulfed in violence smashed : the rest of the seven - shop strip on @entity14 and @entity51 , which was systematically torn apart devastated : the distraught owner of @entity55 's @entity54 hair salon arrived at work to find his business destroyed the roof sagged to the ground in the middle and at the front the wall had given way and fallen in on itself			1
eerily the sign ' @entity16 ' lay intact on the floor at the front of the heap of steaming , smoking rubble			2
next door at the @entity72 the windows had been smashed and the front door had been broken			2
inside glass was all over the floor and water covered the floor			2
the smell of smoke hung in the air and the looters had mindlessly torn off the front of one of the washing machines			1
the @entity86 had also been broken into and the glass front door ripped open but with nothing to steal the rioters had just destroyed it and left			1
a tax office next to that had been completely cleared out of furniture with just a few chairs left inside			1
the owner of @entity55 's @entity54 beauty salon was too upset to comment			1
his windows had been smashed and many of the products on the shelves had been stolen			2
with tears in his eyes , he said : ' there 's a time for talking and it is n't now			1
we just have to rebuild '			1
residents stood and wept as they walked out of their homes and made their way across the street to look at the wreckage on their doorstep			2
teacher @entity112 , 55 , said : ' @entity113 had been here for about 20 years and i used to go there all the time			2
' that @entity118 restaurant had the best fries around here			2
' the laundromat was always busy			2
these were good community stores			1
you had to wait two hours to go to the nail salon it was that popular			2
' there was always something going on			2
where are people going to go now ? ' further down @entity14 the entire block between @entity130 and @entity131 looked like a scene from an urban nightmare - or a warzone			1
all the shops that were not boarded up had broken windows			1
laughing : local @entity137 poses with a bottle of wine and the cans of beer left in a cart outside the shops which had been looted , to have his picture taken by @entity145			1
both men said they had not been involved in the looting last night remains : this looted alcohol ( left ) was left behind by the mob outside the burned out @entity152 ( right ) the @entity154 and @entity155 building on @entity14 this morning : the entire block was burned out the public storage facility had been badly burned and was still smoking			1
the @entity159 's restaurant - which had sheltered many protesters during the unrest in august - had its windows smashed and glass was all over the tables and chairs			1
two shops in the same building - @entity154 and @entity155 - were completely gutted by fire and the roof had collapsed , leaving the air conditioning unit laying on top of the remains			1
white singed bricks were strewn into the street and the back room had become a mass of mangled , charred metal			0
flames were still licking the top of the remaining walls and a trolley full of beers stood out the back which looters had been stealing but left behind			1
@entity145 chuckled as he took a picture of his friend @entity137 as he held up a beer from the trolley			0
destruction : : a rioter uses a stick to break a window at the @entity192 along @entity193 last night nothing left : this was all that was left of the @entity198 @entity118 restaurant this morning after the fire wrecked it picture : ' i do n't condone this but i can understand it			1
i have been racially profiled myself , ' said @entity204 of @entity0 as he took video of the burning of the @entity208 business on @entity14 as they were : the @entity198 and @entity211 loans were both intact before last night 's orgy of violence burning : cars parked outside one row of shops on @entity14 were targeted in the destruction spree burned out : cars parked outside one row of shops on @entity14 were targeted in the destruction spree inspection : the scale of destruction became clear today after a night which saw fires raised across the @entity225 suburb of @entity0 attacked : @entity159 's on @entity14 was smashed up although not set on fire			1
it had previously ( right ) avoided damage devastated : a gas station was among the targets of the violence			1
today property manager @entity232 witnessed the destruction crime scene : much of @entity14 was under police guard today and described by officers as an active crime scene both men , in their 20s , denied having been out during the riot the night before but said they had been out in august during the protests then			1
@entity145 said that the violence but ' good for the pictures but bad for us '			0
he accused the police of being ' @entity246 '			1
but he also joked about the trolley of beers and said : ' it 's like , do you want a beer ? ' before laughing again			2
police refused to let reporters walk along @entity14 and told them : ' this is still an active crime scene '			1
across @entity0 the community struggled to make sense of what had happened			0
interviewed on a local tv station a woman called @entity260 , said : ' these places have been here for a long time - to tear up where you live , it does n't make sense '			0
a caller into a local radio station said : ' there was no peace last night			2
residents on the streets told @entity274 that the wreckage to @entity0 was so bad that it looked like ‘ @entity277 ’			0
another said that it ‘ looked like @entity279 ’			0
almost every building along @entity281 , where the @entity0 police station is located , had been ransacked or vandalised			1
@entity283 and his brother @entity284 , 38 and 40 , had taken the day off from working as school groundskeepers to help rebuild a @entity287 restaurant run by a friend			2
@entity283 said : ‘ i have lived in @entity0 for 38 years and i have never seen anything like this			0
they just want street justice and they do n’t care about how they get it			0
i can not understand why they do what they do			0
the parents are to blame			0
when me and my brother grew up both our parents worked and we were raised knowing how to show respect , and that does n’t happen these days			0
‘ we ’ve had a hard enough time paying our mortgages after the economy went down			0
we do n’t need this ’			0
their friend @entity310 , who was also helping them , lives in the street next to @entity281 and said that it was ‘ like a war ’ the night before			2
more destruction : the arson frenzy also hit @entity281 , about a mile away			0
this branch of @entity319 's was burned out ashes : the @entity321 's was left almost entirely destroyed today after the arsonists struck last night distraught : the manager of the @entity321 's said he understood the protesters were angry but added : ' speaking your mind - that ’s @entity329			1
you are supposed to be able to protest peacefully and make your point			0
but this ... ' et tu : the neighboring antique shop to the @entity321 's was also destroyed in the orgy of violence which hit @entity0 overwhelmed : the antique shops was well alight before firefighters were able to finally bring it under control he said : ‘ these young people are so used to instant gratification , they want stuff now			1
they are too immature to understand that stuff takes time			0
‘ especially something this big			0
it takes dialogue and not everyone will be happy but that ’s compromise			0
‘ these people do n’t want to wait			0
that what today ’s society has come to , not just here in @entity0 - this is @entity329 , this is the world			0
’ further up @entity281 a @entity321 ’s pizza restaurant had been burned to the ground , as had the antiques store next to it			1
the manager of the restaurant , who declined to give his name for fear of reprisals , said that 12 people had now been put out of work and did not know if the owners would rebuild			2
the manager said that the store was destroyed by a tornado three years earlier and they did build it back but it cost ‘ a lot of money ’			0
he said : ‘ most of the people here have families and they are very worried about what will come next for them			0
‘ i ’m proud to work here and started as the dishwasher and worked my way up			0
i had a motorcycle accident and had my foot amputated and they were good enough to give me a job , the manger , a widower with two children in their 20s , said that he was in principle on the side of the protesters but that this was ‘ too far ’			0
he said : ‘ i believe in their right to protest and what they ’re doing is a just case			0
‘ speaking your mind - that ’s @entity329			0
you are supposed to be able to protest peacefully and make your point			0
but this ... ’ so close : while fires burns in @entity0 , the rest of @entity225 is also on edge			0
the center of the city is in the background			0

at least two dozen businesses torched and strips of shops razed to the ground or ransacked
@entity14 , town 's major route , reduced to smoldering ruins and guarded by police
two stores collapsed completely after burning last night and many more have been burned out
but locals have turned up to pick over the remains and *scavenge* alcohol left behind by looters
shop owner turns up in tears to assess damage and says : ' we just have to rebuild '
