breakthrough : the test , which had an 80 per cent success rate in trials , looks for a genetic ' signature that is linked to a high risk of cancer coming back scientists are developing a test to predict which prostate cancer patients are most likely to suffer a recurrence of the disease			1
it means doctors will be able to give those at high risk drugs to improve their chances			0
men who have a low risk of the disease coming back after surgery and radiotherapy will be spared additional treatment			2
the new test , which had an 80 per cent success rate in a trial , looks for a genetic ‘ signature ’ , or pattern , that is linked to a high risk of cancer coming back			1
the @entity30 researchers will release details of their work today at a conference of the @entity34 in @entity35			0
professor @entity36 said between one - third and half of patients face a spread of cancer outside the prostate gland that is not detected in initial treatment			1
he said : ‘ men who fail treatment within two years may be at the highest risk of dying from their prostate cancer			1
‘ new tests are required that are better at predicting which patients will have cancer recur			2
‘ these men can then be offered additional treatments , such as chemotherapy and hormone therapy , that will combat the prostate cancer throughout their entire body			1
in order to improve their chances of survival			0
’ prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men			1
in the @entity64 , more than 41,000 men are diagnosed each year , leading to around 10,000 deaths annually			2
the new genetic test was developed by @entity67 , of the @entity68 , and dr @entity69 , of the @entity71			2
by analysing the dna in tissue taken from a tumour before any treatment , it can predict whether surgery and radiotherapy will be successful for that patient			0
professor @entity36 said : ‘ this is the first report of a test using this information derived from biopsy samples that can predict with close to 80 per cent accuracy which men are at high or low risk of prostate cancer recurring			1
’ the researchers plan further trials over the next two years to ensure it will work in hospitals			0
‘ if all goes well , this will lead to a new test for cancer patients that can be turned around in three days and will tell doctors which patients will do well with local treatment alone – surgery or radiotherapy – and which will need extra treatment , ’ he said			1
tumour : doctors are keen to discover which cancer patients are likely to respond well to treatment the researchers analysed @entity73 from 126 patients thought to be at intermediate risk , and followed their progress for eight years			2
they analysed each patient ’s whole genome to identify areas with missing , extra , or irregular sections of genetic material			0
they found a pattern , or genetic signature , that is common to men at high risk of cancer recurring			1
they tested their findings on 150 further patients , with similar results			0
professor @entity36 said : ‘ these results will enable us to develop a new way of personalising medicine			0
’ █ a prostate cancer treatment called brachytherapy , in which low - dose radioactive seeds are placed inside the prostate , could help half of men to retain their sex lives after treatment			1
research shows this internal radiation is better than conventional radiotherapy , in which only one - third of men have their sexual function unaffected			0
it should be offered to all patients , said researcher dr @entity148 .			0

new test of genetic ' signature ' had an 80 per cent success rate in a trial
one - third to half of prostate cancer patients face disease spreading
prostate cancer is the most common cancer in @entity64 men
