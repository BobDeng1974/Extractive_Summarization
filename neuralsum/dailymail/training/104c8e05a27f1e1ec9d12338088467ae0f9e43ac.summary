it 's long been thought that chillies can help us lose weight			1
now , new research has proved the fiery food can aid weight loss by speeding up metabolism			0
a study found capsaicin – the ingredient that gives chilli peppers their heat - could help burn off fat in the body			1
the temptation to eat fatty foods is often so strong that , for many , they ca n't resist eating fatty or sugary foods even if they are trying to cut down on calories			0
@entity38 researchers found capsaicin may stimulate the body to burn energy and create heat ( a process known as thermogenesis ) – burning off calories in the process			1
it does this by activating receptors in the body which set off the process of energy burning			2
these receptors are found in white and brown fat cells			1
in the body , white fat cells soak up calories and store them as fat – the dreaded type visible in pot bellies , love handles and wobbly thighs that is the enemy of dieters			1
it is known as ‘ bad ’ fat for this reason			2
@entity68 fat , found in small amounts on the shoulders and neck , actually burns fat to heat the body – and is therefore known as ‘ good ’ fat			1
the researchers found that capsaicin in the diet was able to stimulate a receptor called potential vanilloid 1 ( @entity80 ) channel protein			0
activating this receptor suppresses obesity associated with a high - fat diet , the researchers found			1
they believe this is because it induces ‘ bad ’ white fat cells to become energy - burning ‘ good ’ brown fat cells			1
the researchers carried out the study on one group of wild mice , and another group of mice who had been genetically engineered to lack the @entity94			0
metabolism - boosting : @entity96 , which gives chilies their heat , sped up metabolism by inducing ' bad ' white fat to turn into ' good ' brown fat , which creates heat and burns calories they fed both mice a high fat diet , 0.01 per cent was made up of capsaicin			1
@entity96 prevented the weight gain associated with eating a high fat diet in the wild mice , but not the mice that lacked @entity80			1
it did this without having any effect on how much food or water the mice consumed			0
‘ it did significantly increase the metabolic activity and energy expenditure in wild type mice fed a high - fat diet , but not for mice that genetically lack @entity80 , ’ researcher @entity123 , of @entity38 ’s @entity124 said			2
this is because the fiery ingredient induces ‘ bad ’ white fat to become ‘ good ’ , energy - burning brown fat and also stimulates the body to create heat , he added			1
a chemical compound found in spicy curries could help reduce the risk of developing bowel cancer , a study has found			0
researchers gave capsaicin , which gives chilli peppers their heat , to mice genetically prone to developing multiple tumours in their gastrointestinal tract			2
the capsaicin triggered a pain receptor in the cells lining their intestines , setting off a reaction that reduced the risk of growing colorectal tumours			0
scientists found that the treatment extended the lifespan of the mice by more than 30 per cent			0
these steps burn off calories and counteract obesity			2
this may help to prevent and manage obesity and other related health complications such as type 2 diabetes , high blood pressure , and cardiovascular diseases , the researchers said			2
however , they added this effect has not yet been demonstrated in carefully - controlled clinical trials			0
next , the researchers want to further understand the mechanism by which capsaicin prevents obesity , and carry out more trials to further prove that it can help manage weight			2
they will concentrate on developing drugs which activate the @entity80 ! receptors , to help prevent obesity – and carry out human clinical trials - they said			1
they are even developing a ‘ nanoparticle - based sustained - release formulation of capsaicin ’ in the laboratory currently , and have submitted a patent application for this			0
a third of the world ’s population is currently overweight or obese , according to @entity187 ’s estimates			0
this staggering statistic has made finding ways to address obesity a top priority for many scientists around the globe			0
the research was presented during the @entity196 ’s 59th annual meeting in @entity197 , @entity198			0

@entity96 - which gives chillies their heat - could help prevent obesity
it stimulates the body to burn energy and create heat - burning off fat
researchers believe it induces ' bad ' white fat ' to become ' good ' brown fat
@entity68 fat burns calories in order to create heat - managing weight
