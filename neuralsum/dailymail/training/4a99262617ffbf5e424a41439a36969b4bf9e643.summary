and although the @entity5 manager has since apologised for the remark , the @entity0 could not resist a jibe ahead of friday 's fixture			1
@entity0 's ' team coach ' with @entity13 driving it , as imagined by the club 's @entity22 account @entity2 ( right ) accused @entity13 's team of playing ' 19th century football ' when the two met in january the official @entity22 account posted a picture of an old - fashioned horse - drawn coach , with @entity13 holding the reigns			1
the image was captioned with the message ' the @entity0 team coach ( and horse ) has arrived at @ chesleasfc for today 's game # 19thcenturyfootball ' in the build - up to the game @entity2 admitted that he was unwise to use the ' silly ' phrase about @entity0 , who have played much better football this season			1

' when you are fighting against relegation , you have to do everything to get points			0
@entity13 and @entity2 shake hands after @entity5 's 0 - 0 draw with @entity52 earlier this year read our exclusive interview with @entity13 ahead of @entity0 's @entity55 to @entity5 ' yes it was a turning point for them because it gave them the confidence they needed and after that they kept in the division			1
' you see the way they play every game , they are a better team , they have better players and i think also @entity13 is showing now he is not what people sometimes say - a defensive coach , only knows how to play defensively and direct with long balls			2
' he is giving a completely different image about himself , which can make the game more difficult for us but at the same time more attractive for everyone			0
' he has my respect			0
last season i had a couple of words about the fact they started winning time after two minutes of the game , which i do n't like			0
' @entity13 was under pressure when he went to @entity91 last year , but is in a better position now @entity13 has defended the decision to line - up defensively last season , but claims his side could be more adventurous this year			2

‘ but that day he was frustrated , and trying to deflect attention away			0
' look , the way we played that day was n’t very adventurous but i was staring down the barrel of a gun			0
i had to do what i had to do to save my position			0
