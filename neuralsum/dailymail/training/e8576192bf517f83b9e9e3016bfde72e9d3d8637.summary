by @entity1 medical correspondent published : 19:02 est , 6 march 2013 updated : 08:48 est , 7 march 2013 brain surgery has helped women with severe anorexia put on weight for the first time since their illness began , say researchers			1
they used a ‘ pacemaker ’ to stimulate areas of the brain responsible for symptoms of depression , anxiety and obsessive thoughts involved in the eating disorder			2
within nine months half the patients had gained weight and their symptoms had improved , while others had stabilised their weight			1
the pacemaker stimulates areas of the brain responsible for depression , anxiety and obsessive thoughts researchers in @entity28 used a technique known as deep brain stimulation ( @entity31 ) which has successfully helped people suffering from @entity33 ’s and chronic pain			1
patients having @entity31 are fitted with a neurostimulator , a device similar to a heart pacemaker , which is connected to electrodes placed in certain parts of the brain			1
the electrical implant is connected to a small battery under the skin in the person ’s chest or abdomen to generate small electrical signals to stimulate the brain			2
when switched on , the patient benefits from the blocking of abnormal nerve signals which trigger the disabling symptoms			0
the small study of six patients reported in @entity54 medical journal was designed to test safety , but researchers said @entity31 appeared to be capable of treating severe anorexia			0
in a commentary , @entity59 experts professor @entity60 and professor @entity61 of @entity63 ’s @entity62 , said the findings were ‘ promising ’ for patients who had failed on conventional treatments			1
they said ‘ new effective treatments for these patients are sorely needed			0
‘ the fact that the procedure was associated in some patients with improvements in affective and obsessional symptoms is of key importance , since such improvements will go some way towards reassuring patients that @entity31 is not just another treatment designed to fatten them up without making them feel better			0
’ there are around 90,000 @entity59 with eating disorders including anorexia , which often start in the early teens			1
a record number of 1,600 people - mostly girls and women - were given hospital treatment for anorexia in 2011			0
the parents of @entity92 , 18 , last month spoke out against the care system for failing their daughter who collapsed and died after starving herself to barely five stone in weight			1
she had been battling anorexia for five years , but was discharged from hospital after 11 days when doctors ruled she was ‘ physically fit ’ without telling her family because she was over 18			0
she died from a heart attack two weeks later			0
tragedy : @entity104 , 18 , died after a five - year battle with anorexia the new study recruited six women aged between 24 and 57 , who had been suffering from anorexia for between four and 37 years			0
researchers based at the @entity111 and @entity112 in @entity28 used @entity113 ( @entity113 ) to identify a specific area of the brain previously targeted for @entity31 in patients with depression			1
the target area was given stimulation and three months later , five of the six patients stabilised or gained weight			1
after nine months , three patients were maintaining a higher weight than before the treatment started - the longest period of sustained weight gain any had achieved since their illness began			2
around half of the patients also experienced improvements in their mood or reduced obsessive - compulsive behaviour			2
researcher dr @entity134 , a leading neurosurgeon in the field of @entity31 , said it appeared to have a genuine effect on the illness			0
‘ the finding of improvements in mood and anxiety in patients who were still underweight is especially striking , in view of the well known poor response of underweight patients to conventional pharmacotherapies or psychotherapies ’ he added .			0

half patients had gained weight after nine month trial
deep brain stimulation technique also used to help @entity33 *'s* sufferers
@entity59 experts say @entity28 research is ' promising ' for the *future*
