outspoken @entity1 preacher @entity0 has penned another furious tirade			1
but this time , the man who once branded @entity5 law enforcement authorities ' the real terrorists ' was venting his anger on a different topic - the ' despicable ' game of rugby league and its fans			1
in a @entity14 post addressed to his followers , the @entity1 preacher recalled recent scenes of league fever in the heart of @entity20 territory - @entity19 and @entity21 in south - west @entity22			1
he said it was ' horrific '			0
devout : @entity0 has not hesitated to make his opinions known in recent months			0
passionate : @entity20 fans turned out en masse to last night 's grand final showdown			1
@entity20 territory : the blue and white was out in force in south - west @entity22 in recent weeks			1
' cars racing down the road driven by maniacs , horning and honking , disturbing @entity31 's creation , @entity33 women ( @entity34 unfortunately most of the time ) hanging out of the windows screaming and yelling at the top of their lungs , and other despicable and despising scenes , all unfortunately done by @entity33 , some of them in their @entity45 or @entity47 attire			1
' ' spending a few days ... especially around areas like @entity19 , @entity21 and its surroudnings makes a @entity33 bewildered and astonished to what his eyes see , but his heart struggles to accept and his brain to believe			2
' he lamented that the celebrations were not happening because of an occasion , like the religious festival , @entity59			0
or because the @entity60 had hypothetically ceased all airstrikes on the @entity62			0
' so why is all this happening ? ! ' he continued			0
' sadly brothers and sisters , all this is because of a dirty game of rugby			0
' ' a game between two teams named after animals , that has caused grown men to lose their minds , grown women to lose their modesty , and some to lose their faith			1
' an enthusiastic @entity20 fan wields a sign at the preliminary final against the @entity81 earlier this month			0
he wrote that the scene was an example of ' muslims in our time ' and expressed his disgust with some @entity47 women who drape themselves in the @entity20 flag			2
he said they ' strip themselves from their clothes and modesty , to wrap themselves with a flag that has a dog on it , and dance side to side , rubbing shoulders and other parts of the body with tattooed men			2
' ' as one of our beloved @entity105 said before : football has become the @entity111 of our time , the modern devil of this era , ' he said			1
' while the cries of our orphan children , our raped women , and the calls for help from our helpless elders all over the world failed to unite the @entity33 , we see the flag that carries the picture of a dog uniting @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , atheists , and all other sorts of people			2
' @entity0 has not shied from controversy in recent months			0
he has described @entity5 law enforcement authorities as the ' real terrorists ' , and has also said the shooting death of @entity132 , 18 , was ' cold - blooded murder '			0
last month , he reported receiving death threats from ' @entity5 living in @entity5 '			0
mr @entity0 concluded his post , published yesterday , the day of the grand final , by saying he ' dreaded ' what would happen at the game			2
but the streets of south - west @entity22 were not filled with much celebration last night			1
many @entity20 fans were left disappointed when the @entity142 thumped the @entity20 side 30 - 6 in their first grand final victory in 43 years .			1
