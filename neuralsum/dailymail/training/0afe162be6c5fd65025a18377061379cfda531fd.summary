@entity0 won approval from a key @entity3 committee thursday to serve as the nation 's next attorney general , as divided @entity6 clashed over her support for president @entity9 's immigration policies			1
the 12 to 8 vote in the @entity11 sent @entity0 's nomination to the full @entity3			1
@entity0 is a career prosecutor who is currently the @entity13 attorney in @entity14			2
three @entity6 – @entity15 of @entity16 , @entity17 of @entity18 and @entity19 of @entity20 – joined all none committee @entity21 in voting ' yes			2
' attorney general nominee @entity0 was approved by the @entity11 on thursday but her fate in the full @entity3 could be a squeaker the ' @entity25 ? @entity27 senators @entity15 of @entity16 , @entity17 of @entity18 and @entity19 of @entity20 all voted to confirm @entity9 's pick for the top job at the @entity30 ' the case against her nomination , as far as i can tell , essentially ignores her professional career and focuses solely on about six hours that she spent before this committee , ' @entity15 said as he criticized fellow @entity6 for using @entity0 's testimony in support of @entity9 's executive actions on immigration as a reason to oppose her nomination			1
timing is uncertain , but @entity0 is all but assured approval by the full @entity3 as well , under new rules that will require only a majority vote of 51 instead of the 60 - vote margin required for most legislation			1
but she appears unlikely to win confirmation resoundingly , as thursday 's debate demonstrated that many @entity6 will oppose her over @entity9 's executive actions granting work permits and deportation stays for millions of immigrants in the @entity13 illegally			0
' we should not confirm someone to that position who intends to continue that unlawful policy , ' said @entity62 @entity61 sen. @entity61			0
@entity0 , 55 , now serves as @entity13 attorney for the @entity64			0
she would replace @entity65 , the nation 's longest - serving attorney general , and become the first black woman to hold the top law enforcement job			1
at her jan. 28 confirmation hearing , @entity0 sought to smooth interactions with @entity6 , who have repeatedly clashed with @entity65 , by emphasizing her determination for a ' new and improved ' relationship			1
but @entity3 @entity6 delayed a scheduled vote on her nomination two weeks ago in order to further scrutinize @entity0 's record , in particular her support of the @entity9 immigration plan and a settlement she forged with @entity81 in 2012 over money - laundering allegations			1
@entity6 have criticized @entity0 for not probing the bank further over tax evasion at the time her office negotiated a $ 1.2 billion accord with them			0
since her hearing , a @entity88 district court has thrown @entity9 's executive order on immigration into legal limbo and @entity81 has come under fire over allegations it helped clients evade taxes in their home countries			0
@entity11 chairman @entity98 , an @entity99 @entity27 , said after the vote that he feared @entity0 will not be independent of the @entity101 , a problemthe @entity27 has articulated often against @entity65			2
' the current attorney general has permitted politics to drive decision making far too often			0
for that reason , the question for me has been whether ms. @entity0 will make a clean break and take the @entity30 in a new direction , ' said @entity110 , who voted against her			0
' after thoroughly reviewing ms. @entity0 ’s testimony , both before the committee and in written follow - up questions , i remain unconvinced she will lead the department in a different direction			0

@entity0 passed her first test by a 12 - 8 vote , with three of 11 @entity6 joining all nine @entity21 on the panel
new rules require only a *simple* majority vote of 51 on presidential nominees , so she could be confirmed *quickly*
@entity0 , a @entity125 *federal* prosecutor , would replace *outgoing* attorney general @entity65
vote will not be *overwhelming* because @entity0 supports @entity9 *administration* ' *amnesty* ' on immigration
