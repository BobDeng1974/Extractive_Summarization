scientists discovered that a special protein helps fight back cold sores - and that people who lack the protein are much more vulnerable scientists have put their finger on why some people are plagued by unsightly cold sores			1
they ’ve shown that people who get cold sore after cold sore do n’t make enough of a protein that keeps the virus under control			1
the insight could lead to new treatments for the potentially fatal complications of the extremely common bug			0
it has long been known that by adulthood , most people are infected with the cold sore - causing herpes simplex virus type 1 bug			2
however , while up to 90 per cent of adults have @entity20 - 1 lurking in their system , only around a quarter of them will experience frequent outbreaks			2
now , @entity25 scientists have discovered why			2
they began by looking at how cold sores – fluid - filled crusty blisters that occur around the mouth - occur			1
the @entity30 bug is usually caught in childhood and often through a kiss from a family member or friend with a cold sore			0
it passes through the skin and travels up a nerve , where it lies inactive until stress , sunlight , illness or another trigger , awakens it and leads to cold sores forming			1
by analysing thousands of genes , the researchers found one that makes a protein called interferon - lambda that helps keep the virus from being reactivated			2
they then compared the dna of people who regularly got cold sores with that of people who had the virus but were rarely troubled by it			1
in those who often got cold sores , the gene for interferon - lambda tended to be flawed , meaning they made less of the protein			1
this left their immune system unable to keep the bug under control and meant they were plagued by cold sores			2
overall , around a quarter of @entity70 have the genetic flaw that makes them prone to cold sores , the journal @entity68 reports			1
cold sores are caused by the @entity20 virus ( pictured ) , which almost everyone carries			1
but most of the time our bodies can fight the illness off			0
researcher professor @entity80 said the finding shows the importance of studying the person that is infected , as well as the infection itself			0
' most people carry the cold sore strain of the herpes simplex virus but until now we never knew why only some of them develop cold sores			1
' knowing that susceptibility to the virus involved relates to people ’s genes reinforces the need to research , not only the evolution of the viruses themselves , but the susceptibility of the hosts to infection			2
' the professor ’s discovery could lead to @entity105 being used as a treatment for @entity30			0
the risk of side - effects means it is not likely to be used on cold sores , which despite looking unsightly usually clear up without treatment			1
however , it could be used to improve treatment of rare but potentially fatal side - effects of the virus , including infections and swelling of the brain			0
professor @entity80 said : ' @entity30 belongs to a family of viruses that persists in the body for life			0
once you are infected , usually as a child , it persists in the nerve cells			0
you can not really get rid of it			0
' you can only avoid or treat the recurrences			0
it is a particularly nasty type of virus			0

cold sores are caused by @entity20 virus - which almost everybody carries
but most people produce a vital protein which keeps the illness at *bay*
scientists at @entity25 found around a quarter of people produce less of the protein - and so suffer more cold sores
