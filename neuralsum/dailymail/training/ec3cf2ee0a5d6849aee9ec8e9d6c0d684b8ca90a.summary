@entity0 believes he has a duty to prevent @entity2 suffering burnout and make sure @entity6 ’s @entity5 forward is still delivering peak performances in 10 years ’ time			1
@entity2 ’s blistering development is rapidly making him a key player for club and country but , given that he is only 19 , parallels can be drawn with @entity14			1
@entity14 also burst on to the biggest stage at a young age but a series of serious injuries prevented him reaching the heights many anticipated			0
@entity6 ’s boss insisted he had the player ’s welfare at heart , saying : ‘ some managers would take the stance of “ i do n’t care ” because you might only be in a job for three , four , five years , so make sure he plays as much as he can			2
‘ but i think it is critical that , in 10 years ’ time , he is approaching his peak , as opposed to having played his best games			0
‘ when he gets to 28 and if he has too many miles on the clock and he is burned out , that is something we will have to look at			0
‘ as a club , we have managed him quite well but it is hard when you are such a good player and you keep performing and both your club and your country need you			0
’ @entity0 has helped @entity2 mature into an international player , but he is not the finished article			1
