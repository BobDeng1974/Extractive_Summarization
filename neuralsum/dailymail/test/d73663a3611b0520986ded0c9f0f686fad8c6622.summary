humpback whale populations are to be declassified as ' endangered ' following a successful conservation programme			1
at one stage the worldwide population dropped to just a few thousand due to over-fishing and hunting , but it has now recovered to 90,000			1
however , some experts have warned it is too soon to declare the conservation project a success , and that more information is needed to make such a decision			2
@entity12 in @entity13 says the humpback whale is no longer endangered			1
they want to break up global population into 14 sub-populations			1
ten of these will be ' not at risk ' , two ' threatened ' and two still ' endangered '			1
it follows a conservation ' success story ' that raised numbers to 90,000 the proposal , by @entity25 ( @entity12 ) fisheries in @entity13 , is to reclassify the global population of humpback whales into 14 ‘ population segments ’ , based on how they have recovered			1
ten of these would be deemed ‘ not at risk ’ , two would be ‘ threatened ’ and two would remain ‘ endangered ’			1
the endangered species would be off the @entity35 and @entity36 of @entity37 , while the threatened species live in water near @entity40 and @entity41 , which occasionally enter @entity43 waters			2
humans hunted the whales in high numbers , killing 200,000 before their listing as endangered in 1970 , four years after the @entity48 banned commercial humpback whaling			1
the commission put a stop to all commercial whaling in 1986			0
all the whales remain protected under the @entity54 , and the @entity43 is still an active member of the @entity48			0
according to the @entity48 's website , there are only a few places in the world that still allow hunting of humpback whales , and that is for aboriginal subsistence only			2
three nations , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 , still allow the animals to be killed for scientific research			0
humpbacks are found around the world , and officials say protection and restoration efforts have increased their numbers in many areas			2
among those recommended for delisting is the population that migrates each year from @entity80 to @entity81			2
@entity12 officials said decisions on which whale groups to recommend were based on many factors , including the risks they face			1
the single largest threat to humpbacks is fishing activities that result in the whales becoming tangled in fishing gear and drowning			0
protection and restoration efforts have been taking place over the last 40 years after a dramatic reduction in humpback whale numbers			1
until the @entity48 gave them protection in 1966 , more than 200,000 were killed by commercial whalers			0
but since then numbers have risen dramatically , and @entity25 says the entire species is no longer endangered and needs to be reclassified			1
however , even those deemed ‘ not at risk ’ would still be protected under the @entity105			0
‘ the return of the iconic humpback whale is an @entity112 [ @entity112 ] success story , ’ said @entity106 , assistant @entity12 administrator for fisheries			1
‘ as we learn more about the species - and realise the populations are largely independent of each other - managing them separately allows us to focus protection on the animals that need it the most			0
' and in a letter accompanying a petition on the change , the president of the @entity121 on @entity122 , @entity80 said the reclassification was needed to protect the ‘ integrity ’ of the @entity112			0
‘ we support the concept of delisting as a success story and like the bald eagle , gray whale , and gray wolf see this as a cause for celebration , ’ @entity128 wrote			1
‘ the integrity of the @entity112 itself is at stake here and by not delisting a recovered species , the @entity112 becomes suspect , as something other than what it was intended			0
‘ all of the qualifying parameters for recovery have been met , including the population doubling in 20 years and growth of at least 60 per cent of the pre-exploitation abundance			0
’ the proposal , by @entity12 in @entity13 , is to reclassify the global population of humpback whales into 14 ‘ population segments ’ ( shown ) , based on how they have recovered			1
ten of these would be deemed ‘ not at risk ’ , two would be ‘ threatened ’ and two would remain ‘ endangered ’ humpbacks travel very long distances when migrating			1
these two were sighted off the coast of @entity81 , on their way to @entity80 , a popular route			0
this is one of the routes that has been recommended for delisting , as numbers have improved dramatically following the successful conservation programme however , experts have warned that the reclassification is premature , and risks seeing numbers worldwide dropping to endangered levels again			1
@entity174 , species policy officer at @entity176 , said there were other sub-populations of humpback whales aside from these 14 for which data was poor			1
‘ concern remains about other discrete and small sub-populations of humpback whales for which information about their status is lacking , ’ she said			2
‘ we can not get complacent			0
unfortunately , these species still face many current threats such as shipping , oil and gas , and bycatch or entanglement			0
‘ we have to maintain conservation efforts regardless and not let our guard down on global conservation efforts to protect this species			2
’ here a humpback whale dives among an aggregation of short - tailed shearwaters at @entity201 , @entity81			1
scientists still are n't sure why the whales jump out of the water and @entity205 , executive director and senior biologist for @entity207 and @entity208 , said the reclassification was coming too soon			0
‘ humpbacks are a really complicated species to really review for declaring these distinct population segments , ’ she told @entity210			0
‘ it ’s not so simple as drawing a line and saying : “ they belong to this population and there ’s a lot of them so we are going to take them off the list ”			0
’ @entity224 , @entity225 , added : ‘ the sad fact is that , despite that ban , whales are still being hunted on our doorstep here in @entity232 waters and we need to do more to protect them and give whale populations here the opportunity to recover in the same way that these humpbacks have			0
’ and @entity239 , from the @entity238 , told @entity240 : ‘ it ’s important that we concentrate conservation efforts on populations that are still endangered , but i think a more caring society would still offer full protection to all living things			2
' yes , cetacean populations [ which include marine mammals such as whales , dolphins , and porpoises ] have increased , but not to anything like the pre-whaling days			0
’ ‘ why not concentrate on those endangered populations and still leave the global protection in place ? ’ @entity25 is now opening up a 90 - day comment period from the public for the proposed change			2
you can submit comments , information or data through their website .			0

@entity12 in @entity13 says humpback whale is no longer endangered
they want to break up global population into 14 sub-populations
ten of these will be ' not at risk ' , two ' threatened ' and two still ' endangered '
follows conservation ' success story ' that raised numbers to 90,000
