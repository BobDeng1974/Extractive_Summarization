by @entity0 published : 05:00 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 11:21 est , 17 april 2013 @entity1 gave a respectful nod to @entity3 today as she arrived for the great leader 's funeral wearing a pussy - bow blouse - the very distinctive style of blouse made popular by @entity3 herself			1
mrs @entity1 could not have chosen a more fitting sartorial tribute - unless it had been blue , of course - to pay her respects to @entity13 's first female prime minister and longest serving @entity14 in 150 years			1
paying respects : @entity1 wore a pussy - bow blouse by @entity19 label @entity17 for the funeral of @entity3 today , no doubt in tribute to the @entity24 's fondness for the style distinctive style : mrs @entity1 could not have chosen a more fitting sartorial tribute , looking elegant but demure as she arrived at @entity28 with her husband true blues : @entity1 held the pm 's hand as they walked to the service , a dark wool coat worn over her skirt and @entity17 blouse and an elegant sinamay hat style match : mrs @entity1 is known for her excellent style and today the pm 's wife dressed entirely appropriately for the occasion			1
@entity42 , @entity3 wearing one of the tie - neck blouses she adored @entity3 frequently wore the feminine style - buttoned up to the neck with the voluminous silk ties knotted in a bow at her throat - to soften the power suits that were the other weapon in her style artillery			1
if smartly cut jackets , sensible skirts and large shoulder pads gave @entity3 presence and the masculine edge that helped her dominate in a man 's world , the addition of those pussy - bow blouses - @entity3 herself called them ' softening and pretty - rounded the edges of the masculine look			1
@entity3 may have been an indefatigable politician and imposing opponent - but she understood the power of the correct clothes			2
always well dressed - she famously took advice from @entity71 that led her to leave her easy - to - mock hats behind and dress in a more approachable way - she often said it was not ' unfeminine to be well - tailored '			0
indeed , she said , ' it often perhaps concentrates on what you are going to say if you have got well - tailored things on because people no longer look at your clothes			0
' inside the ceremony : @entity1 with prime minister @entity83 , with an emotional @entity84 to the rear thanks in part to @entity3 , the pussy - bow blouse became a style that dominated the 1980s			1
and despite humble beginnings - the daughter of a dressmaker , @entity3 and her sister , @entity90 , grew up wearing home made clothes - @entity3 went on to be a very savvy dresser			1
but it was not until @entity3 met her wealthy future husband , @entity98 , that she could afford to spend a lot of money on outfits			2
she soon forged her trademark style of colourful suits , hats , handbags , pearls - and , of course , those blouses			2
feminine touch : @entity3 said she often wore pussy - bow blouses because they were ' rather softening and pretty ' substance over style : the @entity113 said she always aimed to dress appropriately - and that did n't mean forgoing femininity the former @entity117 leader spoke of her fashion choices in an interview with dr @entity120 for @entity121 in 1985 , saying she did have to be conscious of her image but she was more concerned with feeling comfortable than stylish			1
she said : ' what you do is decide the clothes in which you are comfortable			0
you are going to a great occasion			0
it must be a style that you are comfortable in			0
it must be a fabric that you are comfortable in , that hangs well , and you must know that you look appropriate for the occasion			0
never flashy , just appropriate			0
' while the @entity113 knew what she wore in the male dominated world of politics would help her to be taken seriously , she also did not want to lose her femininity			0
' you do not lose your feminine qualities just because you are a prime minister , ' she said			0
this is why she loved her pussy - bow blouse so much			1
' i often wear bows ; they are rather softening , they are rather pretty , ' she said			0
political wives : @entity144 arriving at @entity145 today , left , and @entity120 with husband @entity146 , right out in force : @entity148 with husband @entity148 , left , and @entity149 with husband @entity150			2
