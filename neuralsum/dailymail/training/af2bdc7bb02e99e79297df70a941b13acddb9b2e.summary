@entity0 has become synonymous with less - than - stellar customer service - and changing a subscriber ’s name to a sexist slur is not likely to improve the company ’s public image			2
@entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , was surprised to receive a note from the cable provider monday trying to convince her not to cancel her service - a request she did not make in the first place			1
but she was even more surprised to discover that the missive pleading with her to stay with @entity0 was addressed to ' @entity17			0
' without a hint of irony , the note then went on to say that @entity0 ' has been working on improvements to deliver better experience every day			0
' ms @entity7 told the technology blog @entity30 that she never asked to disconnect her service and was not sure why the letter was sent to her house			2
when she finally got on the phone with @entity0 , she learned that the name change was made on february 12 - the same day she had a live chat with a customer service representative about a problem with her cable box			1
but ms @entity7 insisted that she was no rude during the online conversation with the @entity0 staffer			2
‘ i was not upset even when they could not resolve my issue and had to send a technician out , ’ she told the blog			0
‘ i have no idea why a @entity0 employee would do this and risk losing their job			0
' @entity0 has admitted to the mishap , claiming that an employee at a third - party vendor has replaced ms @entity7 's first name with the profanity in the cable provider ’s computer system			1
officials at @entity0 stated that the company has since severed ties with the vendor in question , and they are now reviewing their procedures to make sure this does not happen again			0
@entity65 , @entity0 's future owner , sent @entity67 a bill earlier this month addressed to ' @entity69 ' after she fought with the cable company to get the @entity71 back in her package @entity73 and @entity74 were shocked to receive this bill addressed to ' a * * hole @entity74 ' after they tried to cancel their cable from @entity65 ms @entity7 on thursday received an apology from @entity0 , along with a free year of @entity80 and cable service			1
the embarrassing incident comes at a particularly inopportune time for @entity0 , which is currently in the process of merging with @entity65 - the same cable company that made headlines over the past two months for lashing out at their customers			1
less than two week ago , a @entity65 subscriber in @entity89 got a letter from the cable provider , in which her name was changed from ‘ @entity67 ’ to ' @entity93 ' after the woman fought to have the @entity71 added back to her package			2
in late january , @entity73 and @entity74 received a bill from the cable giant that was addressed to ' @entity97 ' after they had an unpleasant exchange with a customer service representative and decided to cancel their service			0
bed reputation : a survery found last year that @entity0 and @entity65 , which are in the process of merging , are the two most hated companies in the @entity104 in 2005 , one woman had a similar experience when a @entity65 invoice addressed her as a ' b * * * * dog '			1
other customers , who sent their relabeled bills to customer advocacy writer @entity111 , said their names had been changed to ' dummy ' and another to ' whore @entity113 '			0
@entity65 announced in february 2014 that it will acquire @entity0 for $ 45billion , raising serious concerns among government regulators and industry experts about the impact the merger might have on the companies ' subscribers			0
