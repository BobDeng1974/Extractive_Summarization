by @entity0 last updated at 10:54 am on 29th november 2011 rugby ace @entity3 's appeal against a £ 25,000 @entity5 fine has been successful , it has been reported shamed rugby star @entity3 was reinstated to the @entity8 rugby squad because he ca n't remember his raucous @entity10 drinking session , it emerged today			1
the husband of the @entity13 's granddaughter , @entity12 , went on a drunken night out in @entity14 after @entity8 's disappointing @entity10 opener against @entity16 in september			0
but after being dropped form the @entity18 , @entity8 bosses made a dramatic u-turn in admitting @entity3 's memory loss was a ' mitigating factor ' in reinstating him			0
@entity5 chiefs have also cut @entity3 's fine from £ 25,000 to £ 15,000 after the 33 - year - old appealed			1
explaining the decision , @entity5 chief executive @entity24 said : ‘ @entity3 did not intentionally mislead the @entity5 team management when he stated that he could not remember where he was on the night of september 11 , and that he was relying on other people ’s versions of events which were relayed to him			1
' newly - wed @entity3 downed cut - price shots at a ‘ dwarf - tossing ’ competition with fellow players and cavorted with a glamorous former girlfriend			1
afterwards @entity35 , director of the @entity5 elite squad , warned that his behaviour would ‘ not be tolerated ’ and he was thrown off the team , effectively ending his international career			1
but yesterday , the player won his appeal against the decision and was allowed back on to the elite squad			0
in his appeal , @entity3 claimed that there were no protocols on the night in question , including no ban on alcohol or curfew			0
the @entity50 backed the 33 - year - old and described the punishment as ‘ extraordinary ’ and ‘ unprecedented ’			2
his reinstatement is largely symbolic because the squad disbands at the end of the year ready for a new one to be announced for 2012			0
however , he could now potentially be selected for future international matches			0
@entity3 , who married world champion eventer @entity12 in july , had heaped embarrassment on his bride after he was seen embracing the woman later revealed as his ex-girlfriend @entity61			0
@entity3 with his wife , @entity12 , who is the @entity13 's granddaughter at the time of his punishment , @entity3 ’s father @entity62 insisted he had been made a ‘ scapegoat ’ because of his connection to the @entity66			1
but the @entity5 accused @entity3 of breaching the @entity8 elite player squad agreement			1
mr @entity35 was even more scathing			0
‘ @entity3 ’s actions reached a level of misconduct that was unacceptable in a senior @entity8 player , ’ he said			1
@entity5 chief executive @entity24 added : ‘ there was no evidence of any suggestion of sexual impropriety of any nature with the woman in question , and we accept the fact that she is a family friend who he has known for a long time			2
‘ @entity3 expressed deep regret during the appeal meeting about his behaviour , and that he had apologised to [ then @entity8 manager ] @entity86 and the team for the events which unfolded as a consequence			2
’ however , he added that @entity3 ’s behaviour ‘ fell way below that to be expected of somebody of his calibre and experience ’			2
the @entity97 player had , he said , ‘ exposed himself to a very compromising position and exposed the rest of the team to damaging publicity ’ .			0

@entity5 chiefs also cut his fine from £ 25,000 to £ 15,000
