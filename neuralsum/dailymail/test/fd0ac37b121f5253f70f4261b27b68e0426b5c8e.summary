@entity6 , joined by friends @entity8 and @entity9 were on an aluminium rowboat when the encounter occurred off the west coast of @entity13 , @entity14			1
filming from the boat , @entity6 captured the orcas swimming from afar – two of them can be seen jumping from the water			2
at a safe distance : the group cheer in excitment as @entity6 captures two orcas swimming and jumping from the water the group on the boat cheer and yell in excitement at what they are witnessing as the whales appear to start moving closer to the boat			1
according to @entity6 , the group believe that the rope being pulled along the side of the boat is what attracted the pod to them , as its distinctive sound disturbed the whales			2
commenting on their approach , one of the group can be heard saying : ‘ they ’re probably coming to check us out			0
’ the group believe that the sound of the rope being pulled along the side of the boat is what attracted the orcas one of the group states that the orca is probably coming to check them out before it emerges from the water and gives them all a fright before later adding : ‘ that is like 50 yards from us , ’ as the marine mammals continue to head in the direction of their boat			2
after suggesting that it might be a good idea to start rowing away , one of the group begins panicking and shouts : ‘ guys we need to get out of here , it ’s coming right at us			0
’ he then states : ‘ we need to sit down in the boat			0
we need to get out of here			0
it is probably under us			0

’ ' we need to get out of here ' : the group panic as a killer whales approach their aluminium boat the killer whales are videoed circling and swimming dangerously close to the tiny boat suddenly an orca emerges from the water right beside the boat and the panicked member of the group screams in shock			1
meanwhile the killer whales begin circling and swimming dangerously close to and underneath the tiny boat			1
slightly less shocked now that the whale has made a relatively tame introduction , the group laugh nervously and begin heading back to shore			2
