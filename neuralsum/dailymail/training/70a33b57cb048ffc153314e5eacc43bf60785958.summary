by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:10 est , 12 august 2013 updated : 15:31 est , 12 august 2013 sensible : international development secretary @entity3 defended giving aid to @entity5 , which has launched a space programme @entity8 giving millions of pounds to @entity5 while it embarks on a space programme is a ‘ sensible investment ’ , the government insisted today			1
the oil - rich country , which has accepted £ 300million from @entity8 in aid this year alone , has set in train ambitious plans to launch its own rockets and even put a man into space			1
but international development secretary @entity3 was backed by @entity19 after arguing that it was money ‘ well spent ’ by @entity5			1
however a @entity22 spokesman was keen to stress to @entity1 that @entity8 is ' not providing any aid funds to @entity5 ’s space programme '			2
the first @entity5 astronauts are being trained to join @entity27 , @entity28 or @entity29 missions within the next two years			1
at the same time the @entity8 taxpayer is sending £ 1.14billion in foreign aid to the country over the five years of the @entity33			1
the revelation sparked a storm of protest last week , coming after @entity38 mep @entity37 accused the government of ‘ treason ’ for sending billions in aid to ‘ @entity42 ’ while making cuts to police and social services at home			1
but ms @entity3 insisted the foreign aid sent to @entity5 would ‘ help @entity5 progress and develop as a country ’			1
she told @entity50 : ‘ i believe it is being well spent but we obviously have to make sure that we critically assess the projects underway			0
‘ we do expect them to invest in their country as well			0
the so - called space programme was in fact investment in satellites , weather satellites and for communication			0
‘ so actually this investment that they ’re making in the so called " space programme " which is actually satellite technology , some of which is actually has been provided by @entity8 companies based in @entity63 , is a sensible investment and actually one that we would be expecting them to be making alongside the investment that we make			0
’ space race : a @entity5 engineer at work on one of the country 's satellites developed in a @entity8 laboratory @entity5 ’s space programme started in 2003 but its first satellite lost power and disappeared from orbit			1
it now has three in space , @entity82 , @entity83 - 2 and @entity5 - @entity84 , the first to be constructed by @entity5 engineers			2
although it has bought its own satellites and launched on @entity27 rockets , @entity5 has built laboratories which it hopes will produce its own space craft by 2028			2
the @entity90 confirmed @entity5 astronauts should be trained and ready for space travel within two years			1
big spending : @entity5 has already launched these surveillance rockets from @entity27 as part of its plans to join the space race in july this year , @entity90 ’s director general , professor @entity98 , declared : ‘ by our road map we are supposed to have astronauts prepared by 2015			1
before the end of the year , the recruitment of astronauts will begin so that we have them handy and as soon as we get the nod we can pick from that number			2
’ critics last week asked why @entity8 was , in effect , subsidising a space programme for a nation where 70 per cent of people live below the poverty line			1
the £ 1.14billion @entity5 will receive over the five years of the @entity33 is double the £ 500million set aside to prop up struggling accident and emergency departments at our own hospitals			1
backbench @entity117 mp @entity116 said it was ‘ totally unjustifiable and unaffordable ’ for @entity8 to give this money to @entity5 , given the scale of its ‘ grandiose ’ space programme			2
‘ we can not go around the world saying “ do n’t worry , we will feed your public for you while you waste your money on all sorts of other projects ” , ’ he said			0
‘ we have got to say to these countries “ you have got to spend that money on your people where it ’s most needed not on some grandiose space programme ”			0
we are against welfare dependency at home but at the same time we are encouraging welfare dependency abroad			0
’ the row surrounding mr @entity37 flared when he insisted that sending aid to @entity138 was tantamount to treason			1
he added : ‘ how we can possibly be giving a billion pounds a month , when we ’re in this sort of debt , to @entity42 is completely beyond me			0
’ he claimed foreign leaders frittered the money away on ‘ @entity145 sunglasses , apartments in @entity147 and @entity148 ’			0
poverty : millions of @entity5 are living in poverty , despite the country earning huge profits from its oil deposits resources : @entity5 generates millions in oil revenue every year but much of the population lives in poverty the @entity22 ’s budget is rising by 35 per cent in real terms by 2015			1
but while aid costs are ballooning , spending on the military , the police , border control and care homes is being slashed			0
@entity8 is also spending about £ 280million a year on aid to @entity167 , another country with its own space programme			1
debate : @entity38 mep @entity37 has reignited the issue of @entity8 's foreign aid contributions with his infamous ' bongo bongo land ' comments despite @entity5 having the second - highest national income of all @entity138 countries , most of its people still live in poverty			1
it is also mired in corruption			0
the most modest estimates suggest between £ 2.5 and £ 5billion is stolen from the state ’s coffers every year by corrupt officials and politicians			0
@entity187 from the @entity188 ’ @entity186 , said : ‘ when budgets are tight both for families and the government alike , people can not understand why ministers are sending more and more of our hard - earned cash overseas			0
‘ taxpayers find it especially unacceptable when their money is sent abroad as aid to developing countries which then somehow find sufficient cash to fund the likes of a space programme			0
‘ it is totally unacceptable that @entity8 taxpayers ’ money is effectively subsidising @entity5 ’s efforts to send an astronaut into space			0
’ the @entity5 government has not released detailed figures on how much it is spending on its space programme , but it is thought to be hundreds of millions of pounds a year			2
@entity8 aid to @entity5 will increase by 116 per cent under the @entity33 government , from £ 141million in 2010/11 to £ 305million in 2014/15			1
it amounts to a total of £ 1.14billion over five years			0
the country has also been criticised for failing to crack down on corruption			0
the only senior figure from @entity5 to have been prosecuted over corruption in recent years was jailed by a @entity8 court			2
@entity221 , the former governor of the country ’s oil - rich @entity222 , was sentenced to 13 years for money laundering , forgery and fraud totalling nearly £ 50million			1
he used the money to live a lavish lifestyle , buying a house in @entity231 worth £ 2.25million and luxury cars worth over £ 650,000			0
last night a spokesman for the @entity22 said spending aid money in @entity5 would help cut crime and illegal immigration in @entity8			2
‘ no @entity8 aid money goes through the @entity5 government , ’ she said			2
‘ our investment goes into specific health , education and poverty reduction programmes			0
@entity5 is home to a quarter of the poorest people in @entity138 , and supporting their development will benefit our own trade and security			2
