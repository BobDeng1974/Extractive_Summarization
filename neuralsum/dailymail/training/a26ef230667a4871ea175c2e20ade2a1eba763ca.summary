by @entity0 published : 11:48 est , 20 october 2013 updated : 17:28 est , 20 october 2013 he has already been reprimanded for claiming that a burglar was ‘ courageous ’			1
now judge @entity3 has sparked outcry again – this time for letting off a sex offender after deciding his crime was ‘ water under the bridge ’			1
the controversial judge allowed predatory @entity9 , 35 , to walk free from court despite hearing that he had forced an underage girl into oral sex			1
judge @entity3 said because @entity9 assaulted the girl 15 years ago , it was ' water under the bridge ' @entity9 , a bouncer , admitted carrying out the attack more than 15 years ago after the traumatised victim spoke to police			1
he has previously been cautioned for a similar offence , the court was told			2
but in a move that has outraged campaigners , judge @entity3 spared him jail because he was between 16 and 18 years old when the incident took place			1
@entity9 was also suffering from a head injury at the time , which the judge said may have clouded his judgement			2
judge @entity3 said : ‘ you were a teenager suffering from the effects of a head injury which made your maturity and responsibility less than somebody of your age			1
‘ this is water under the bridge			0
you have lived 15 or 17 years without other convictions and there is no reason to think you will be committing offences in the future			2
’ judge @entity3 gave @entity9 a three year community supervision order at @entity48 ( pictured ) this is just the latest in a string of controversial rulings by @entity52 , who last year praised the ‘ courage ’ of burglar @entity56 and let him off with a suspended sentence			1
he told him : ‘ it takes a huge amount of courage , as far as i can see , for somebody to burgle somebody ’s house			0
i would n’t have the nerve			0
’ he was criticised for his choice of words , which were branded a ‘ serious error of judgment ’			0
following an investigation , the lord chancellor @entity69 and lord chief justice lord judge upheld complaints about the comments and issued @entity52 with a reprimand for his remarks which had ‘ damaged public con - fidence in the judicial process ’			2
then in april , judge @entity3 sparked anger again when he let paedophile @entity79 skip jail because he thought he ‘ would suffer very badly ’ in prison			1
judge @entity3 previously reprimanded for saying burglar @entity56 ( pictured ) had ' courage ' in the latest case at @entity84 on friday , judge @entity3 heard that @entity9 indecently assaulted his victim , who can not be named , in the late 1990s			1
@entity9 pleaded guilty to one count of indecent assault on a child under 16 after admitting he groped the younger girl between the legs and forced her to have oral sex			1
judge @entity3 praised him for pleading guilty and sparing his victim the ordeal of giving evidence before handing him a three year community supervision order			1
@entity9 , of @entity95 , @entity96 , was also ordered to sign the sex offenders register			2
yesterday , as he had sunday lunch with his mother , @entity9 was unrepentant when asked about the judge ’s soft ruling			2
he said : ‘ i ’ve got nothing to say			0
i only pleaded guilty so that i could stay out of prison			1
’ speaking after the case , @entity105 , of sex abuse charity @entity106 , said : ‘ it might be water under the bridge for him but not for his victim , she has to live with it for the rest of her life			0
‘ his comments are outrageous			0
it ’s as though he is saying that because it happened a long time ago , no harm done			0
‘ this kind of thing can discourage victims from coming forward			0
a judge ’s comments are important and the main reason people say they do not report abuse is the fear that they will not be taken seriously or wo n’t be believed			2
’ @entity125 , of the @entity127 charity , said : ‘ it ’s a disgrace			0
what a stupid thing for a judge to say			0
how can it be water under the bridge for the victim ? ‘ there ca n’t ever be water under the bridge for the victim before justice is done			0
‘ and it ’s secondary victimization for them to have to see an offender walk free from court			0
