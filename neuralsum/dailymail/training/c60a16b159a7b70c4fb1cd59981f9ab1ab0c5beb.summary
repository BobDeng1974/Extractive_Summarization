vice-admiral @entity4 , who was fired last year as second in command of @entity8 nuclear forces , spent 1,000 hours at the poker tables during the 18 months leading up to his downfall when he was caught with three fake chips in an @entity13 casino			1
mr @entity4 denies playing any role in the making of the chips , despite dna evidence linking him to the process of turning a genuine $ 1 chip into a fake $ 500 one			1
gambler : @entity22 @entity21 was known as ' @entity23 ' at the local casino , and spent more than 1,000 hours - or 15 hours per week - there in the 18 months leading up to the fake chips incident mr @entity4 has previously admitted that he played the fake chips at a poker table in the @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity13 , in june 2013			1
he was caught with three fake chips , but claimed he had found them in the bathroom of the casino , and decided to play with them			2
as part of a @entity1 criminal investigation into the counterfeit chips , mr @entity4 was fired as no. 2 commander of @entity8 nuclear , and downgraded from a three - star admiral to a two - star admiral			1
the three chips in question were altered with paint and stickers to make genuine $ 1 casino chips look like $ 500 chips			1
an @entity50 lab found a ' major contributor ' of mr @entity4 's dna on the underside of the adhesive sticker that had been affixed by the counterfeiter			2
mr @entity4 claims he found the fake chips in the mensroom at the @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity13 in a statement released in april this year , mr @entity4 said he deeply regretted having not immediately surrendered to security officers the four chips which he said he found in a toilet stall at the @entity29			1
he said it was an ' error of judgment ' that he put three of the chips in play at a poker table , and said he was sorry that he subsequently lied in saying he had purchased them from a man in the bathroom			0
' i should have either told the truth or remained silent instead of lying about the events when questioned ' by an @entity13 state investigator on june 18 , 2013 , he wrote			0
that was two days after he played the fake chips and casino officials determined they were counterfeits			0
he added , ' this lapse in judgment does not make me a thief and a criminal			0
' mr @entity4 also wrote that he does not have a gambling problem			0
however , a new document released under the freedom of information act paints a different picture			0
according to these documents , mr @entity4 was known as ' @entity23 ' at the @entity29 , and spent more than 1,000 hours - or 15 hours per week - playing poker in the casino in the 18 months leading up to the fake chips incident , the @entity84 reports			1
at the time of the casino incident , mr @entity4 was deputy commander of @entity91 , which has responsibility for the nation 's entire nuclear weapons force and is based near @entity95 , @entity96			1
mr @entity4 denies playing any role in the making of the chips , despite dna evidence linking him to the process of turning a genuine $ 1 chip into a fake $ 500 one mr @entity4 wrote that in discussing his case with the commander of @entity91 at the time , air force gen. @entity104 , as well as @entity1 officers and law enforcement officials in @entity13 , ' the common opinion is that i have a ' gambling problem ' and that this gambling problem was my motive ' in the counterfeiting			1
he added that @entity104 , who has since retired from the military , felt mr @entity4 had an ' obvious gambling problem			0
' mr @entity4 wrote that he does not have a gambling problem and does not consider poker a form of gambling			0
' regardless of anyone 's opinion on the matter , disapproval of the legal manner in which i spent portions of my off - duty time is not adequate grounds to allege criminal misconduct , ' @entity4 wrote			0
mr @entity4 had been at risk of being prosecuted by the @entity1 for counterfeiting the chips , but @entity131 chose instead to give him what the military calls non-judicial punishment â€” in this case a letter of reprimand and the loss of $ 4,000 in salary			2
@entity1 officials have said no court martial was sought because the available dna evidence against @entity4 might not hold up in court			2
in his april 2014 statement to @entity131 , mr @entity4 wrote that he suspects the chip counterfeiter left them in the bathroom stall ' for a reason , ' possibly to observe casino security 's reaction when the finder either turned them in or put them in play			2
' i do not believe i was singled out to find them , but believe that i was a patsy for someone who wanted the chips to be found , ' he wrote			0
mr @entity4 's gambling habits ' may be a symptom of wider malaise at the heat of @entity8 's nuclear deterrent , ' the @entity84 writes			1
earlier this month , @entity8 defense secretary @entity164 pledged an additional $ 10 billion to correct deep problems of neglect and mismanagement within the nation 's nuclear forces			2
@entity170 ordered top - to - bottom changes in the nuclear arsenal 's management , which he said had been allowed over the years to backslide , afflicted by broken and missing equipment , poor leadership and inadequate training and staffing			0
@entity170 announced that the @entity178 will boost spending on the nuclear forces by about ten per cent a year for the next five years , a total increase of about $ 10 billion over the five years .			0
