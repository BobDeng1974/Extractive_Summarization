while @entity1 steals headlines for emerging from the ranks to lead @entity5 hockey to victory over almighty @entity7 on saturday , it 's his gorgeous fiancee who 's now stealing hearts			1
even at eight months pregnant , @entity10 managed to remain the picture of blonde beauty as she cheered on the 27 - year - old @entity13 forward , but the intense game - winning shootoout nearly proved to be too much			1
' i might go into labor , ' joked @entity10 , as she watched the breathtaking display from home in @entity19			2
back at home , eight months pregnant fiancee @entity10 could n't have been more thrilled @entity10 told @entity27 that she 's accustomed to her fiancee 's prowess and that , despite all the excitement , it 's no surprise he 's rocketed to overnight superstardom			1
' he 's been a hearthrob for a while , here in @entity13 at least , ' said the pert , smiling @entity10 , who stayed behind because of her looming due date			1
nonetheless , @entity38 raised @entity1 barely made it to the @entity40			0
he was among the final selections for the @entity43 roster and while he has never had a 20 - goal @entity45 season , @entity1 leads the @entity48 team 's @entity43 - born players with seven shootout goals this year			1
@entity1 scored four times in the shootout and put the winner between the @entity55 goalie 's legs in the eighth round , leading the @entity43 past @entity7 3 - 2 in the thrilling revival of the classic @entity48 hockey rivalry stretching back to the @entity5 's @entity60 win			1
so , it may have been his small fish attitude less than his underdog status that made @entity1 's game winning shoot out goal so unexpected			1
just ask @entity10 what he said when he called her after the game			2
' i hope this all blows over pretty quick , ' @entity10 recalls @entity1 saying about the media frenzy currently encircling him			2
' this is n't really him , ' she said			0

' i definitely have faith in @entity97 and i think they have a shot at the the gold			0
' @entity1 's rise to fame was sparked thanks to a quirk in @entity48 hockey rules			1
whereas in the @entity45 , teams must alternate which players they choose to face the goal keeper in a shootout , in the @entity40 a coach may choose the same man each time			0
@entity1 was chosen for the @entity43 men 's hockey team with just such a situation in mind , and the shootout specialist concocted one last clever goal to silence an arena filled with screaming @entity55 fans			1
history in the making : @entity43 forward @entity1 scores the winning goal against @entity7 goaltender @entity25 in a shootout during overtime of a men 's ice hockey game at the 2014 @entity40 @entity128 : ' i hope this all blows over pretty quick , ' @entity10 recalls @entity1 saying about the media frenzy currently encircling him international rules allow the same player to take multiple shots after the first three rounds of a shootout , and @entity43 coach @entity138 leaned on @entity1 's array of slick shots and change - of - pace approaches to the net			1
@entity1 scored on the @entity43 ' first shot before taking the last five in a row , going 4 for 6 against @entity25 and disappointing a @entity147 crowd including @entity55 president @entity148			2
@entity1 's final shot was a beauty : he threaded a forehand right through @entity25 's pads , the puck punching the back of the @entity55 net emphatically enough to pop the water bottle on top into the air			0
the @entity43 men are only interested in the one that all but wrapped up an automatic berth in the quarterfinals next week			0
' i think you 're going to see @entity1 become a household name after that display he put on , ' said @entity168 , @entity1 's teammate in @entity13			2

@entity1 was born in @entity186 , @entity187 , but as a boy moved to @entity179 in hockey - crazed @entity38			2
