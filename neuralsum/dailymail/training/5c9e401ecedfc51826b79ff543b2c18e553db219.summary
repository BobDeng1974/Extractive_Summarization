@entity0 has revealed witchcraft is thriving across rural parishes in @entity3 in his autobiography a church minister has revealed witchcraft is very much alive and well in his @entity8 rural parishes as he warns against becoming involved in the occult			1
reverend @entity15 has spoken of how he has come across witches , the use of effigies and the ' evil eye ' during his career in the @entity8 countryside			1
he has detailed a number of spine - tingling tales after the latest figures in the 2011 census revealed 83 witches and 93 satanists are living in @entity3			1
@entity0 , who is the minister of five congregational chapels in rural @entity24 , even detailed how he had to call out an exorcist after a witch placed a curse on one of his parishioners			1
he said : ' this is not a joke and i would warn people not to get involved in the occult			2
' i have been told that a coven of witches still meet locally			2
' there is also a witch living in a nearby village who advertises her services in the local paper			0
' in his autobiography , @entity0 describes how a curse on a parishioner had to be lifted by an exorcist after a ' poppet ' or ' effigy ' was made of a chapel member of his			0
he said : ' in folk - magic and witchcraft , a poppet is a doll made to represent a person , for casting spells on that person			0
' a poppet or effigy would be used with very sharp needles stuck into its ' heart ' as a way of doing evil to an enemy			2
' it was this evil type of poppet that was used on a chapel member of mine in the @entity71 area in 1994			2
' it took an experienced @entity74 exorcist to ' raise ' this curse , which had been placed by a witch on the instruction of another former church member			0
' the motivation behind this ' evil ' was envy that had turned into jealousy			2
' @entity0 wrote the book , called a @entity85 , to act as a warning to people not to get entangle in the occult			0
@entity0 has detailed how he come across the use of effigies , the ' evil eye ' and witches during his time as a church minister the @entity24 church minister , who has preached in @entity96 for over 20 years , also said he had battled a case of the ' evil eye ' which left a mother and her young child needing hospital treatment			1
he said : ' this is an ancient belief in the existence of a malevolent power in the glance of some people , which is almost invariably provoked by envy or jealousy			0
' in this instance , a lady who had given birth to a baby boy was apparently wished bad luck by the " evil glance " in the eye of a childless spinster neighbour			1
the church minister has told of how he had to call out an exorcist , similar to the 1973 classic film , after a parishioner was cursed by a witch ' both mother and child were subsequently taken ill due to acute breathlessness for no apparent medical reason and had to be hospitalised			1
' the spinster even visited the mother and child in hospital while i was speaking to them			0
' it became obvious to me that the spinster was praising the baby to its mother in a very false and patronising way			0
' @entity0 said he had come across witches during his time as a minister , while the exorcist had to be called after an effigy , or poppet , was made of a chapel member of his this is one of the most noticeable characteristics of the utilisation of the " evil eye "			1
' realising this , i asked the spinster to say " @entity151 bless you " to the baby , having just said what a beautiful child the mother had			0
' after that the spinster immediately walked away without uttering another word			0
' @entity0 said the mother later placed a horse shoe amulet in the porch of her home as a precautionary measure to protect her son and herself from the effects of the ' evil eye ' .			1
