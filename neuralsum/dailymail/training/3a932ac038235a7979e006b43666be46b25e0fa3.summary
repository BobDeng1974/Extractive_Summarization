the successful appeals by @entity9 , of south - east @entity10 , and a second man , who has been granted anonymity , defy the government 's pledge to deport any foreign national convicted over the 2011 disturbances			1
critics say the decisions sharply contradict official efforts to take exemplary action against those involved in the outbreaks of violence in @entity10 and elsewhere that summer			2
a @entity25 store burns on @entity26 on august 6 , 2011 : two foreign rioters jailed for their part in the civil unrest have foiled attempts to deport them by citing their human right to ' family life ' government anger over the use of @entity34 of the @entity35 , which enshrines the right to a family life , has prompted home secretary @entity38 to draft new laws to stop foreign criminals avoiding deportation			1
ministers believe judges will be unable to ignore the new legislation , as they appear to have ignored rules introduced last july that they should only allow the use of @entity47 in ' exceptional circumstances '			1
immigration minister @entity49 said today : ' any foreign national who abuses the privilege of coming to the @entity53 by committing a serious offence should face the consequences			1
' many of those convicted of involvement in the 2011 summer 's riots are still behind bars - that 's where they belong			0
' we are pursuing deportation in scores of cases and wherever possible we will remove them from the @entity53 — regardless of whether they have family here			1
' we are disappointed with this judgment and that is why this government will bring forward primary legislation to prevent foreign nationals remaining in the @entity53 through abuse of the @entity35			1
' we are also looking at appeals to make sure that foreign nationals can not misuse the legal system and the courts in bids to stay in the country			2
' a youth films rioters throwing missiles at police lines on august 8 , 2011 : government anger over the use of the @entity35 has prompted @entity38 to draft new laws to stop foreign criminals using it a masked rioter is seen dragging a bin in to make barricades in @entity92 : more than 200 foreign criminals were convicted for their part in the riots in which hundreds of millions of pounds of damage was done the latest cases , reported in the @entity98 , highlight the arguments used which are causing the @entity101 such frustration			1
in the first case , @entity103 - born @entity102 , from @entity104 , was in november 2011 jailed for 18 months for burglary during the riots in @entity10			0
the 25 - year - old entered a building which was being looted by rioters but did not steal anything because , he told the court , ' there was nothing left to take '			0
the @entity101 began deportation proceedings against him as he approached his release from jail last summer , but he appealed against the move by citing his ' right to a family life '			2
he argued his relationship with his two biological children in the @entity53 as well as his current partner 's children meant his human rights would be breached if he was deported			0
the lower immigration tribunal agreed and , following an appeal by the @entity101 , the decision was upheld by @entity129 judge @entity128			2
the second case is of a @entity131 who can only be named as ' ts ' after senior immigration judges granted him anonymity - despite the fact criminal courts had allowed him to be named			2
he was convicted of violent disorder and jailed for 15 months after joining a group of 30 to 50 youths who rampaged through two @entity145 towns in copy cat riots three days after the initial outbreak of violence in @entity149			0
the gang , which was later described in court as a ' mindless mob ' , swept through @entity153 and @entity154 launching attacks on vehicles and shops , including a @entity159 takeaway whose owners were robbed of their takings			0
@entity133 was identified as one of the main culprits who launched an attack on a bus which left its driver ' frightened for her life ' as they kicked the vehicle and pelted it with rocks			0
a masked youth during riots in @entity92 , @entity10 : both the rioters in today 's story were granted the right to remain in the country based on their right to a family life under @entity34 of the @entity35 ministers had pledged to take tough action to kick out foreign criminals as quickly as possible after the riots in august 2011 which began in @entity149 , north @entity10 and spread across the country into several nights of carnage			1
more than 200 foreign criminals were convicted for their part in the riots in which shops were plundered , businesses set ablaze and hundreds of millions of pounds of damage done			1
@entity101 minister @entity193 said at the time : ‘ we strongly believe that foreign national lawbreakers should be removed from the @entity53 at the earliest opportunity			1
‘ we also have the power to cancel visas of foreign nationals found guilty of criminal activity , and this is something we will be looking to do when these cases arise			2
’ in the following months , it emerged that @entity205 nationals played a central role in the mayhem			0
figures from the courts showed one in seven of all convicted rioters was from overseas			0
the @entity212 released a list showing 44 nationalities of convicted rioters , including those from @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity220			0
