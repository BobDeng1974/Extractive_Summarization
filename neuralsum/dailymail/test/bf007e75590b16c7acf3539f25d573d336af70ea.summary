three former @entity1 rugby internationals on a charity expedition to the @entity3 continued with their trip despite the landing gear of their plane collapsing on their way out			1
@entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 said they felt nothing more than a jolt			1
poor visibility at the makeshift 800m strip beside the @entity18 operated @entity19 first caused an aborted landing			0
three former @entity1 rugby internationals - @entity10 , @entity12 and @entity11 - continued with their trip to the @entity3 despite the landing gear of their plane collapsing on their way out the experienced pilots were then forced to break harder than usual when a crack appeared on an ice floe near the runway			1
but the stars played down reports of a near miss as they celebrated a safe return from their epic endeavour to raise money for the @entity36 and the @entity37			2
@entity10 , 36 , said : ' we did n't know anything was wrong			2
' ' there were murmurs about it and instead of it being a smooth landing i think maybe they had to put the plane down a bit quicker than normal			0
but i was n't particularly bothered by it			0
' someone left to update @entity10 's @entity50 account wrote that the rugby star had called and said the men were safe before the accident @entity10 reminded followers to donate and posted a picture of the plane @entity11 , 42 , said there was a jolt on impact but it was n't until the 36 passengers were getting off that the plane 's nose lifted and it sank back on its rear loading bay			1
the group were flying from the most northerly town in the world , @entity68 on the @entity70 archipelago , to the @entity18 operated camp when the accident happened last week			0
@entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 were part of a nine - strong team including three @entity37 and directors of yachting company @entity76			1
@entity10 ( left ) and @entity12 ( right ) might be used to a pitch - but they would have found the ice floes and five - feet high ridges at the @entity3 a little more challenging @entity11 runs past centre @entity81 of @entity83 in the @entity84 , @entity85 , in 2003			1
it is hoped the expedition will raise £ 250,000 for the @entity36 as well as the @entity37 after the incident they were taken by helicopter to the exact latitude of 89 @entity3 before loading up their 60 kilo sleds and trekking to the pole			2
their journey took them across ice floes and up five - feet high ridges and they endured temperatures as cold as -50c			0
