the anguished family of a soldier who was killed by his comrade in a vicious attack at their barracks after a late - night drinking session have branded his murderer ' dishonourable and cowardly ' , after he was sentenced to life in prison			1
@entity11 veteran corporal @entity10 , 32 , was murdered by 23 - year - old lance corporal @entity12 at @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , in march			1
@entity12 had always denied killing his fellow member of the @entity17 but was found guilty by a jury after a four - week trial at @entity20			1
after @entity12 was sentenced to life in jail , the victim 's family said the sentence was ' not comparable ' to the ' immeasurable , unforgettable and indefinite ' devastation caused by corporal @entity10 's brutal murder			1
lance corporal @entity12 ( left ) has been jailed for life for strangling corporal @entity10 ( right ) to death at their barracks after a night of heavy drinking in a statement , they said : ' while we are pleased that justice through the courts has prevailed , there remains a void in our lives that will never be filled			1
' the sentence received by @entity12 is not comparable to the sentence carried by those who knew and loved @entity45 , for which there is no limit			2
' the actions of @entity12 have significantly impacted on @entity45 's family and friends , including his colleagues within the @entity53			1
' the devastation caused is immeasurable , unforgettable and indefinite			2
' the family , who sat throughout the proceedings , added that @entity57 was a man of ' ambition , drive and potential ' , whose life had been stolen along with an ' opportunity to have children and settle down '			0
' we would like @entity45 to be remembered for the legend that he was and not for the dishonourable , cowardly and brutal way in which he was taken from us all , ' they added			0
corporal @entity10 was found dead in his room in march this year , after @entity12 raised the alarm			1
the pair had been out drinking in @entity72 the night before and corporal @entity10 had punched @entity12 while they were in a pub. @entity12 had told jurors how he stumbled upon @entity10 's battered body the next morning			1
but the court heard there had been three - and - a - half hours earlier that morning where @entity12 's movements could not be accounted for			2
jurors had been told how corporal @entity10 's neck was broken in three places during the brutal attack			1
he was also punched in the head , stomach and genitals			0
sentencing , judge @entity88 told @entity12 he had carried out a ' very severe assault ' on @entity57 in his room			2
the judge said : ' that is not however how you killed mr @entity10			2
you killed him by sustained pressure to his neck with either a ligature or manually , like some form of arm hold			0
' in the course of the strangulation , the judge added , @entity57 had dug his fingernails so hard into his own neck in a bid to break whatever hold was on him , it had left marks			0
judge @entity108 added he was satisfied there had been ' premeditation ' in the attack , and that having killed @entity57 , @entity12 then ' left his body '			2
the attack took place at the @entity17 's @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , in march the family of @entity116 , pictured outside court , have said they want him to be remembered for his ' drive , ambition and potential ' rather than the brutal way in which he was killed ' i am satisfied that there is no sensible possibility you went looking for mr @entity10 for purely peaceful reasons and only reacted with such violence as a result of something that passed between you			1
' despite @entity12 's denial , the jury at @entity20 agreed with the prosecution case that the 23 - year - old soldier , from @entity136 , had murdered @entity57 by ' inflicting a series of heavy blows ' and breaking the older man 's neck in three places			1
he was ordered to serve a minimum 15 years behind bars			0
@entity12 had claimed he remembered nothing of the night 's events , having drunk at least a litre of @entity147 liqueur			0
the court previously heard there was ' no history of ill - feeling or animosity ' between corporal @entity10 and and @entity12 , who served in a different company in the regiment			1
during the trial , jurors were told how @entity12 went alone to corporal @entity10 's room at about 9.15am on march 8 this year and , apparently then finding him dead , raised the alarm			1
talking about the night before , @entity159 described an incident in the town 's @entity162 and @entity163 pub , where an ' annoyed ' @entity12 complained some soldiers were ' acting " like maggots "			2
' later that night , as @entity167 from inside the nearby @entity169 pub showed , @entity57 floored @entity12 with a right hook , cutting his own knuckle and the young lance corporal 's lip in the process			1
witnesses later told how @entity57 had claimed the younger man was ' trapping off ' before he landed the punch			0
@entity12 would also later tell colleagues he had been ' gobbing off ' to the corporal , said mr @entity180			0
the prosecutor said that punch ' could provide an explanation for a later attack carried out by mr @entity12 , as revenge for what had happened '			0
after the fracas , both men left separately , returning to barracks within minutes of each other at about 3am			0
superintendent @entity191 , who handled the case , read a statement on behalf of the victim 's family @entity12 's movements could not be accounted for between his arrival back at base , and 6.30am , when he was discovered asleep on the floor of the guard room			1
the last time corporal @entity10 was seen , he was sitting outside the accommodation block housing his third - floor room on the base just after returning to the barracks			1
between 4am and 4.30am that morning , a soldier whose room was opposite @entity57 's thought he heard ' bumping noises ' and a male voice say ' " @entity211 " , two or three times , ' said mr @entity180			0
that soldier got out of bed but only to lock his door from the inside , and did not look out onto the adjoining corridor to see what was happening			0
mr @entity180 said @entity12 awoke in the base 's guardroom , then went back to his room to shower , washing his clothes at the barracks ' laundry			2
he asked one soldier ' " where 's @entity229 's room ? " - in reference to @entity57 , saying he could n't remember anything , and wanted to apologise , ' added the prosecutor			1
@entity12 got to @entity57 's room at about 9.15am , and said he found the other man lying on the floor in just his underpants			2
' according to @entity12 he made vigorous attempts at resuscitation , and that would have led to a significant transfer of dna , ' said mr @entity180			0
@entity12 would later tell police he squeezed @entity57 's testicles ' to see if he was conscious , as part of @entity53 training he had received ' , he added			0
describing @entity57 , from @entity246 , @entity247 , the judge said it was clear he was ' obviously a hugely well - liked and respected soldier ' and ' a loved and trusted comrade ' much missed by his family			0
mr @entity108 said he had read ' very moving statements ' from @entity57 's family			0
' as a family , it will clearly take a very long time for them to come to terms with mr @entity10 's death and the circumstances of it , ' he added			1
' no one reading their statements could remain unmoved			0
