@entity0 has admitted it needs to get tougher on trolls and has already introduced new ways to report abuse to weed out the perpetrators			1
but now it 's taking aim at the rising levels of revenge porn and stolen nude photos posted to the site			1
its rules now say that users must not ' post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject 's consent '			1
@entity0 's rules have been updated in an attempt to clamp down on revenge porn			1
under ' private information ' ( pictured ) the guidelines now say that users must not ' post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject 's consent '			1
the site said it will verify complaints and suspended abusive users the changes were spotted by @entity28 , which recently submitted a q&a to @entity30 when the community site took a similar stance against pornographic posts			1
@entity0 has used these questions to address the changes			0
both @entity0 's rules and abusive behaviour policy have been updated to reflect these changes			1
@entity0 said that an affected user can report a post if they believe it contains photos or videos posted without their consent			1
in february a law was passed that made posting revenge porn images and videos a criminal offence in @entity50 and @entity51			1
both @entity52 and @entity53 are considering similar laws			0
under the rules , revenge porn is considered : ' photographs or films which show people engaged in sexual activity or depicted in a sexual way or with their genitals exposed , where what is shown would not usually be seen in public '			1
it covers images shared without the subject 's permission and ' with the intent to cause harm			1
offenders face up to two years in jail			0
this follows laws in sixteen @entity75 states - including @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 - explicitly relating to revenge porn			1
under copyright laws the video or photos technically belong to the person who took it and who can , in theory , distribute it as they see fit but @entity0 's rules additionally considers the people in the footage			1
it will ask the person reporting the abuse to verify they are the person in the post and that it was posted without their permission			1
@entity0 said ' agents will then act on content posted in violation of the policy ' , including removing the post or suspending the accounts of repeat offenders			1
' users who believe that content they post has been incorrectly identified is violating the policy can appeal the decision and agents will review that request as well , ' said the firm			2
' content that is identified as violating our policy will be hidden from public view and users posting it will have their accounts locked ; those users will be required to delete the content in question before being able to return to the platform			0
' users posting such content with an intent to harass will be subject to suspension from @entity0			1
' the changes follow reports @entity0 would start banning users who violate its rules by tracking email addresses and phone numbers			1
this means that if an offender attempts to sign up for other accounts using these details @entity0 will be able to intervene			0
reports recently claimed @entity0 will start banning trolls and abusive users by tracking email addresses and phone numbers			1
when people sign up by email they are also given the option to add a phone number ( pictured )			0
in the future , @entity0 may ban accounts accused of abuse until they provide this number stories of abuse , threats and internet trolls have become commonplace on @entity0 in recent years			2
@entity154 ' daughter , @entity153 , left the social platform last year after being sent disturbing images in the wake of her father 's suicide			0
feminist critic @entity160 was threatened with rape , sexual violence and death by @entity0 trolls during the ' @entity166 ' saga after she criticised the way women are portrayed in video games			2
in the @entity171 , journalist @entity170 also received rape threats after she voiced her support for the campaign to introduce @entity175 as the new face of the £ 10 note			0
@entity0 users @entity178 and @entity180 admitted sending the messages to ms @entity170 and both were jailed last year			2
when people sign up to @entity0 they are required to provide an email address , which is then validated			2
adding a phone number is an optional step and is predominantly used if people want to receive text notifications or setup two - step verification			0
under the reported plans , once a user is banned these email addresses and phone numbers will be stored and cross-referenced each time a new user signs up to the site			0
last month an internal memo sent by @entity0 's chief executive @entity196 revealed the 51 - year - old thinks his site ' sucks at dealing with abuse and trolls '			1
in the memo , mr @entity196 said he is embarrassed by the way the company handles abuse and that it must take stronger action in the future			2
mr @entity196 's comments were posted on an internal forum among @entity0 employees , after one employee raised the question of what more could be done to tackle online abuse			1
in december , a blog post titled ' building a safer @entity0 ' revealed @entity0 is working on ways to make it easier to block and report abuse			1
the site has since improved the reporting process to make it more mobile - friendly , and it now requires less initial information			0

' we are also beginning to add several new enforcement actions for use against accounts that violate our rules			0
these new actions will not be visible to the vast majority of rule - abiding @entity0 users - but they give us new options for acting against the accounts that do n't follow the rules and serve to discourage behavior that goes against our policies			2
the safety of our users is extremely important to us			0
it 's something we continue to work hard to improve			0
' in recent years @entity0 has come under fire for failing to protect its users from trolls			2
