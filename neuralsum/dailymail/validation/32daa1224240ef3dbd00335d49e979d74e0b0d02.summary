no - one will linger long over this			2
at some point on thursday morning it will be gone , expunged from the memory , all thoughts turning to a significant @entity6 qualifier with @entity7 on sunday			1
for both nations this was what it was			2
an improving @entity12 have their own qualifier against @entity15 and , like the @entity16 , had an eye on the bigger prize			1
the 85th - minute corner from debutant @entity20 which placed the ball onto the head of goalscoring substitute @entity23 salvaged the night from irrelevance			1
@entity23 gets above his marker to head the ball into the corner for a late winner for @entity29 @entity23 celebrates his late goal , which was one of the few memorable moments in a game lacking intensity or quality the @entity37 centre back celebrates with his team - mates after securing the win five minutes from time @entity41 gets a shot away , one of few clear cut chances created by either team , but was unable to put his team ahead the @entity47 striker is denied again by @entity48 as he goes through one on one to try and break the deadlock @entity29 : @entity51 ( @entity50 45 mins ) , @entity52 ( @entity53 78 ) , @entity54 , @entity55 ( @entity23 45 ) , @entity56 , @entity57 ( @entity58 63 ) , @entity59 , @entity20 , @entity60 ( @entity61 45 ) , @entity41 ( @entity62 63 ) , @entity63			1
subs not used : @entity65 , may , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , , @entity70 , @entity71			2
goal : @entity23 85 @entity12 : @entity48 , @entity73 , @entity74 ( @entity75 81 ) , @entity76 ) , @entity77 , @entity78 ( @entity79 70 ) , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 ( @entity83 69 ) , @entity84 ( @entity85 75 ) , @entity86 ( @entity87 58 )			1
subs : @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94			2
referee : @entity96 ( @entity97 ) a captain ’s performance from @entity59 was also worthy of note			2
throw in some decent runs and crosses from @entity103 left back @entity56 in his first start and @entity105 will take value from this			2
with @entity109 , the enigmatic @entity110 winger who tried his utmost to enliven a comatose friendly , there was evidence of a promising new line of attack			2
yet the truth is this			2
it was no night for snap judgments			2
@entity105 fiddled with his resources , never really fielding anything resembling his strongest first 11			2
at times this was a stark reminder of why the @entity122 are now a distant , mothballed relic			2
‘ i thought it was important to win this game , ’ said the @entity29 boss			1
‘ just to make us feel good about ourselves			0
the performance was good at times			0
we got used to the pitch as well - which is a bit slick			0
@entity12 have improved immensely over the last year , beating @entity131 and @entity132			1
’ they never threatened a repeat			0
their boss @entity135 , an old face on the @entity16 scene , said : ‘ for us i thought there were more positive than negatives			1
but we did n’t get enough good balls in the box			0
we left a lot of our first - choice players out , seven or eight of our players that will probably start on sunday [ against @entity15 ]			1
’ @entity23 ’s breakthrough came in his first appearance for his country since november 2013			1
it came late , as people crept towards the exits , resigning themselves to a mediocre scoreless draw			0
the @entity37 defender ’s header from the penalty spot crept through a ruck of bodies and into the net via the inside of the post			0
@entity12 's @entity162 carries the ball away from @entity60 as both sides warmed up for competitive football @entity29 captain @entity59 issues instructions from his position in front of the back four @entity109 ( right ) , who was one of @entity29 's livelier players , takes on @entity171 defender @entity80 on the wing it was a reward @entity29 just about deserved			1
they had given it a go in the opening half , but looked to have run out of ideas after a raft of substitutions			1
thank goodness for @entity63 , a cult figure amongst the @entity183 , who brings an energy and industry to his work			0
even on nights like this			0
nights when , bluntly , others ca n’t quite find their game			0
reared a mile or so from @entity193 his endeavour and tempo kept things interesting when an unspecified crowd estimated at less than 30,000 allowed their minds to drift towards the latest plot on @entity202			1
@entity63 was at the heart of the first major chance in just four minutes , scurrying down the left flank and playing a one - two with @entity56			0
a sharp cut - back was turned towards goal at the second attempt , @entity12 keeper @entity48 – also @entity210 ’s keeper – producing a terrific save to push the ball over the bar			1
the early touch gave the keeper confidence			0
he would need it as @entity63 embarked on a one - man war of attrition			0
the little winger , whose goal in @entity220 last september has already become an iconic moment , was hellbent on adding to his tally			0
he smashed a low right - foot shot from 20 yards in nine minutes			0
scuttled forward and hit one wide with his right in 20			0
then wasted a great chance after @entity57 nicked the ball off the toe of @entity228 and teed him up two minutes later , thumping past the post again			0
@entity77 goes up for a header against @entity52 as the two sides attempted to stamp their authority on the friendly fixture @entity234 star @entity20 , who made his debut in wednesday night 's game , controls the ball in midfield it took half an hour for another @entity29 player to have a crack on goal , @entity41 ’s low shot from 18 yards taken comfortably by @entity48			1
five years have passed since @entity41 , @entity47 ’s £ 14million man , last scored for his country			1
the only strike in 19 appearances for a player people screamed for during the infamous @entity249 spat			0
no - one remembers the goal – in a 2 - 1 @entity253 qualifying win over @entity254 in april 2009			0
instead they remember @entity257 ’s v - sign to photographers or goalkeeper @entity50 ’s smirk in the aftermath of the infamous @entity262 episode			0
a @entity41 goal celebration in a @entity29 shirt is now a solitary event			1
he had another chance to change that before half - time , making the run to take a @entity60 pass and trying to dink a shot over @entity48			2
to his credit the @entity272 keeper – an old hand around these parts – would not be beaten			0
@entity41 lasted an hour before accepting that this , once more , would not be his night for a goal			1
@entity171 's @entity74 ( left ) , the @entity12 captain , holds off @entity52 as the ball goes past @entity48 gets up well to punch away , under pressure from @entity29 striker @entity41 , as @entity80 watches on the substitutions are a necessary nuisance in these games			1
keen to try as many players out as possible before sunday , @entity105 made plenty			2
@entity61 and , critically , @entity23 joined @entity50 as half - time replacements , the @entity287 replacing @entity288 ’s @entity51			1
on the hour mark , @entity58 and @entity62 – @entity41 ’s replacement - were also handed a half hour to turn things around			1
for @entity12 , the arrival of the mercurial @entity87 - scorer of extraordinary goals for @entity288 - and former @entity292 skipper @entity83 also raised interest levels			1
for @entity20 , it was a tentative , but promising debut			0
he ran around a lot and showed sharpness , and almost made the decisive impact in 69 minutes – taking a neat lay off from @entity61 and thrashing a long - range shot a couple of yards wide			0
with the best assist record in @entity97 football , he also takes a decent corner			0
a swirling inswinging ball picked out @entity61 for a firm header which hit the target , but failed to seriously trouble the confident figure of @entity48			0
@entity20 had better luck with his delivery from a corner five minutes from time when @entity23 claimed his third goal for @entity29			1
and just when @entity12 boss @entity135 thought his young , inexperienced side had come through the game unscathed			1
against a @entity7 team who have shipped 21 goals in four qualifiers , @entity135 expects @entity29 to do likewise			1
‘ there is a lot more depth in the @entity29 squad at this moment in time , ’ he said			1
‘ they moved the ball well and looked strong and powerful			0
@entity63 , in the first 15 or 20 minutes , caused us problems			0
i do n’t anticipate @entity7 will give you too many problems			1
’ in that regard he probably spoke for a nation			0
@entity63 and @entity80 battle for the ball in a game that had plenty of endeavour without much quality from either side the teams observed a minute 's applause for the late @entity343 before the game at @entity193			2

@entity23 heads in 85th minute winner in front of sparse crowd
@entity41 misses best chances in tight first half , as @entity29 *dominate* but struggle to create
@entity29 face @entity7 on sunday , while @entity12 are at home to @entity15 on the same day
