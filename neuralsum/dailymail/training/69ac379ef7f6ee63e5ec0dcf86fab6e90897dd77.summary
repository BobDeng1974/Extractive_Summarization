by @entity0 published : 04:03 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 11:20 est , 9 january 2013 ' disgraceful ' : boxing writer and broadcaster @entity1 used a @entity4 radio spot to accuse a @entity6 schoolboy of swearing at him and spitting at his wife one of @entity9 's most high profile boxing journalists has accused a leading school of ' absolutely disgraceful behaviour ' - claiming on live @entity12 that a student swore at him and spat at his wife			1
@entity1 used the popular 5 live show fighting talk to give a verbal battering to @entity18 , following an incident during a rugby match involving his son			1
the state secondary 's alumni include @entity23 , the current @entity24 , and several international rugby players			0
the pundit , known as ' @entity27 ' , said one of its teenage students walked up to them on the sidelines , swore at him and then spat in his partner 's direction			0
mr @entity1 's son was playing for @entity35 , a private school in @entity36 with fees of up to £ 21,000 a year			1
' i was standing there and suddenly this kid , a 17 - year - old , called me the second worst word you can use on the @entity4 and spat at my wife , ' he said on 5 @entity47 's most popular show , listened to by more than one million people			1
' i have discussed it with a number of people in the rugby world and they can not believe it			0
' i have been to six @entity54 and thousands of sporting events during the 25 years i have been covering sport and i ’ve never seen behaviour like it from a player			0
' he added it was ' absolutely disgraceful behaviour ' and said @entity6 should be placed in the dictionary to represent everything ' naughty , outrageous or disgusting in sport '			0
but after the school denied his version of events and accused him of ' provoking ' their student , 5 @entity47 's acting controller @entity65 has today apologised to headteacher @entity71			1
mr @entity71 , a former rugby player for @entity72 , says the boy spat at the ground , not at @entity1 's wife , and although he called him a ' stupid t * * * ' the school denied the boy called him a ' c * * * ' or a ' p * * * * '			1
the pupil had been given a ' dressing down ' , he said			0
after hearing his version of events mr @entity65 wrote in an email seen by @entity83 : ' i have spoken to @entity1 today to tell him this was a private matter that he should n’t have raised on @entity12 5 live			1
it is not an issue he will discuss again on this radio station			0
' as you know from our conversation , i ’m sorry for the inconvenience this has subsequently caused you			0
thank you for accepting my apology			0
' unfortunately he ( mr @entity1 ) has used his privileged position as a @entity4 radio presenter to create what he sees as entertainment by criticising and naming a school and attempting to disparage both this school and our town , ' he said			1
unsavoury : the incident happened during a schools rugby match as mr @entity1 watched his son ( file picture ) ' this is grossly unfair based , as it was , on one isolated incident			2
those who know the school will not recognise the presenter ’s comments applying to @entity18			2
' i would hope that @entity1 regrets the comments he made in the name of so called entertainment			1
' mr @entity1 denies shouting at the boy but admitted today he should not have brought it up on fighting talk			2
' i do n't want the kid to get in trouble			0
i want him to be reprimanded , ' he told the @entity134 , adding : ' perhaps i should have written to the school and not mentioned it on fighting talk			0
' but perhaps some little kid should n't have gobbed or sworn at two people standing on the sidelines on a fantastic winter 's afternoon in @entity6			2
' a spokesman for the @entity4 told @entity83 this morning : ' this is a matter between @entity1 and the school			1
' the school 's local mp , @entity146 @entity144 , has also stepped in to slam @entity1			2
' it is ridiculous to use a national radio broadcast to launch a personal tirade against a teenage school boy and his school , ' he said			0
' unlike mr @entity1 i know @entity18 to be an excellent school with strong standards of discipline			1
' mr @entity1 ’s broadcast comments about the worst behaviour he had seen in 25 years were , in my opinion , absurd and melodramatic			2

boxing writer @entity1 made claims on 5 @entity162 - listened to by more than a million people each week
' i was standing there and suddenly this kid , a 17 - year - old , called me the second worst word you can use on the @entity4 and spat at my wife , ' he said
@entity18 demand apology from him and say he ' provoked ' their pupil by shouting at him
' i would hope that @entity1 regrets the comments he made in the name of so called entertainment , ' says headteacher
today @entity4 apologises to school over the *outburst*
