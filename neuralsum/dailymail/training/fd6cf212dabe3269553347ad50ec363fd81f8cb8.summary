by @entity1 reporter published : 05:20 est , 18 may 2013 updated : 06:26 est , 18 may 2013 it has been standing for 600 years , but the future of @entity5 's oldest shop is shrouded in doubt today after it was put up for sale			1
historians have discovered the post office and stores in a tiny community of @entity12 , @entity13 , was originally used as a warehouse for buying and selling wool and fabric as long ago as 1420			1
over the following centuries the building has been home for butchers , grocers , ironmongers and drapers and since the start of the last century it has been a successful general store and post office			1
sub-postmaster @entity26 outside @entity27 in @entity13 which has been put up for sale			1
it has been standing in the village for 600 years under threat : the shop in 1930			1
historians have discovered it was opened as a warehouse in 1420 unchanged : @entity27 today , barely any different , apart from a splash of paint , to what it was hundreds of years ago coincidentally , the village is also home to @entity5 's oldest garage , @entity43 , but the future of one of the venerable businesses is now in doubt after the 94 - year - old owner of the village shop died and its executors put it on the market			1
sub-postmaster @entity26 said : ' we all hope the new owner keeps the shop open , there has been a lot of interest in the @entity27 - it would be perfect for someone like a burnt - out banker who wants to do something else			1
' it has become part of the village landscape and we get customers who have been coming in for all their lives			0
' they started as children buying penny sweets on their way to school and now they collect their old age pensions here			0
' mr @entity26 , 68 , who has managed the post office for 15 years , added : ' most things you need in life can still be bought in the village - we have a paper shop , general store and a butchers an archive picture from 1908 shows a horse drawn carriage outside the popular village shop territorials line up outside the venerable old shop in 1909 the wings for @entity89 in 1943 when the building was a sweet shop ' the nearest other post office is at least six miles away in any direction so we would like to see it kept as a going concern - and i 'd like to carry on looking after the post office			1
' but the five - bedroomed property will need complete renovation - nothing has been done to it since it was bought by retired @entity102 major @entity101 and his wife @entity103 fifty years ago			0
as it is a grade two listed commercial premises any change of use would have to be approved by the local district council - who are notoriously keen on preserving the character of old buildings			0
@entity113 died in 1997 and his wife eight years ago at the age of 89 when the @entity27 was left to mrs @entity117 's elderly sister @entity116 , a spinster who lived eight miles away in @entity118			2
she allowed the staff of three to carry on running the place but now after her death 15 months ago aged 94 , the executors of her will are keen to sell and settle her estate			0
the heavily - timbered building - which has changed little in appearance for several centuries , also contains a remarkable unaltered two - storey barn			2
@entity12 @entity131 in 1914 , which is almost exactly the same today the village in the 1950s with a rather stylish car to boot into the colour age , possibly in the 1960s , and shop is still standing bills from the 1870 's show the shop , apart from selling general groceries such as biscuits , cheese from @entity145 , sugar , loose tea and shag tobacco , was also a thriving hardware business which stocked stoves , brushes , carpets , carriage varnish , shot and hair oil			2
in the early 20th century @entity155 - whose family also owned the village garage - extended the range of goods on offer to include clothes , dresses , shirts , stockings suspenders			2
however @entity27 is now on the market and village 's population of 1,200 is anxious and hoping that it will continue in its present form as a deli , fruit and vegetable shop and sub post office			1
@entity174 archivist @entity173 said : ' it is an extraordinarily well - preserved building and much of it remains unchanged			0
' it has been part of village life for centuries and there is a door in the shop that is covered in masses of signatures of the people who have worked there over the years			2
' medieval buildings expert @entity187 , who examined the property , said : ' it may well have served as a building containing market stall or shops within arcaded walls while the rear contained workshops and warehousing			0
' architectural historian mr @entity187 , who teaches at @entity198 , said : ' the building contains any number of exceptional features which had they all survived would represent a rare survival from the @entity204 world			0
the cars are different today but the shop has n't altered a great deal it is doubtful the shop would have sold the array of goods it does today even 20 years ago , let alone 100 ' @entity213 remains among the most fascinating and beguiling buildings in a county which is justly famed for them			0
' the lime - washed property - which includes five - bed living accommodation - is now up for sale through agents @entity221 and @entity222 for Â£ 565,000			0
partner @entity223 said : ' it would make a lovely home as well as a unique business opportunity in a remarkable historic building			0
' @entity12 , from where the @entity228 left for @entity230 in 1620 , also boasts @entity5 's oldest garage - once run by the same family who owned the post office stores			1
@entity43 opened in 1900 when it looked after steam - driven cars and mended farm carts			0
extraordinarily , the village is also home to @entity5 's oldest garage , @entity240 's , shown here almost 100 years ago @entity240 's garage as it is today			1
