' my body is literally bending the mattress like an accordion , ' @entity6 told the @entity31 about his private room , which costs @entity33 and @entity34 up to $ 10,000 a month			0
he then claimed that the facility offered nothing in the way of food , giving him just lettuce , tomato and two pieces of bread for lunch each day			0
he also says he is being verbally abused and that he is forced to wait hours to receive his medication			0
@entity6 is only responsible for $ 800 a month to stay at the center , which all comes out of his @entity34 check			2

@entity6 , a 560 pound sex offender who was convicted of attempted rape in 1994 , wants to sue the medical center where he lives
the center , *largely* *funded* through taxpayer money , does not provide him with enough food or a good enough bed he claims
@entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , where @entity6 lives , have not responded , but did give him a better bed
