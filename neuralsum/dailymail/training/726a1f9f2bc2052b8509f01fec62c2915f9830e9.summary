the @entity21 surveyed 2,000 full - time workers to look at their current health and gauge their attitudes towards sickness			1
stress and depression are now the most common causes of long - term absence in the workplace and require an average recovery time of 81 days			1
that means workers who are absent with either illness and are without a company sick policy could end up thousands of pounds out of pocket			0
according to the @entity39 , the average @entity38 wage is £ 26,664			2
it means workers at the mercy of @entity18 could lose on average £ 4,671 if they collected just £ 86.70 a week over 81 days			1

‘ however , we wanted to highlight the impact that being off sick can have on an individual ’s finances and lifestyle			0

‘ the reality is that some people will need to be off work for a large chunk of time			0
‘ when we buy a car , a washing machine or even a phone we resign ourselves to the fact that at some point it might breakdown			0
‘ however , far too few of us have a back - up plan in place that would protect our income if we found ourselves unable to work			0
‘ having a contingency plan , such as income protection , offers peace of mind so if we become ill we can focus on recovering			0
