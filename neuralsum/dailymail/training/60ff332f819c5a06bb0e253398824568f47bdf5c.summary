a divided @entity0 said on monday that prayers that open town council meetings do not violate the @entity3 - even if they routinely stress @entity4			1
the court said in a 5 - 4 decision that the content of the prayers is not significant as long as they do not denigrate non-christians or proselytize			1
the ruling by the court 's conservative majority was a victory for the town of @entity15 , @entity16 , outside of @entity17			1
the @entity19 administration sided with the town			0
monday 's ruling was consistent with the earlier one			0
justice @entity39 , writing for the majority that included , said the prayers are ceremonial and in keeping with the nation 's traditions			1
' the inclusion of a brief , ceremonial prayer as part of a larger exercise in civic recognition suggests that its purpose and effect are to acknowledge religious leaders and the institutions they represent , rather than to exclude or coerce nonbelievers , ' @entity39 said			2
@entity39 and his four colleagues in the majority all are @entity56			2
they are : chief justice @entity58 and justices @entity59 , @entity61 and @entity62			0
justice @entity63 , writing for the court 's four liberal justices , said , ' i respectfully dissent from the @entity0 's opinion because i think the @entity69 of @entity15 's prayer practices violate that norm of religious equality — the breathtakingly generous constitutional idea that our public institutions belong no less to the @entity76 or @entity77 than to the @entity78 or @entity79			1
' @entity63 was joined by justices @entity80 , @entity82 and @entity83			0
of the four , three are @entity84 and @entity83 is catholic			0
@entity63 said the case differs significantly from the 1983 decision because ' @entity15 's town meetings involve participation by ordinary citizens , and the invocations given — directly to those citizens — were predominantly sectarian in content			1
' five long years : @entity23 , left , is an atheist and @entity24 , right , is @entity84			1
both women complained about town council meetings in @entity15 , @entity16 , starting with opening prayers a federal appeals court in @entity16 ruled that @entity15 violated the @entity3 by opening nearly every meeting over an 11 - year span with prayers that stressed @entity4			1
from 1999 through 2007 , and again from january 2009 through june 2010 , every meeting was opened with a @entity4 - oriented invocation			1
in 2008 , after residents @entity24 and @entity23 complained , four of 12 meetings were opened by non-christians - including a @entity84 layman , a wiccan priestess and the chairman of the local @entity109 congregation			1
a town employee each month selected clerics or lay people by using a local published guide of churches			0
the guide did not include non-christian denominations , however			0
the appeals court found that religious institutions in the town of just under 100,000 people are primarily @entity4 , and even @entity24 and @entity23 testified they knew of no @entity122 places of worship there			1
the two residents filed suit and a trial court ruled in the town 's favor , finding that the town did not intentionally exclude non-christians			2
it also said that the content of the prayer was not an issue because there was no desire to proselytize or demean other faiths			0
but a three - judge panel of the 2nd @entity140 @entity139 said that even with the high court 's 1983 ruling , the practice of having one @entity4 prayer after another amounted to the town 's endorsement of @entity4			2
@entity39 , however , said judges should not be involved in evaluating the content of prayer because it could lead to legislatures requiring ' chaplains to redact the religious content from their message in order to make it acceptable for the public sphere			2
' he added , ' government may not mandate a civic religion that stifles any but the most generic reference to the sacred any more than it may prescribe a religious orthodoxy			0
' @entity39 himself was the author an opinion in 1992 that held that a @entity4 prayer delivered at a high school graduation did violate the @entity3			2
the justice said monday there are differences between the two situations , including the age of the audience and the fact that attendees at the council meeting may step out of the room if they do not like the prayer			2
in her dissent , @entity63 said the council meeting prayers are unlike those said to open sessions of @entity182 and state legislatures , where the elected officials are the intended audience			0
in @entity15 , ' the prayers there are directed squarely at the citizens , ' she said			0
@entity63 also noted what she described as the meetings ' intimate setting , with 10 or so people sitting in front of the town 's elected and top appointed officials			0
children and teenagers are likely to be present , she said			0
the case is @entity15 v. @entity24 , 12 - 696 .			1

town council meetings in @entity15 , @entity16 opened nearly every meeting over an 11 - year span with prayers that stressed @entity4
in 2008 , after residents @entity24 and @entity23 complained , four of 12 meetings were opened by @entity208
@entity0 said in 5 - 4 decision that prayers ' content does not matter as long as they do not denigrate non-christians or proselytize
justice @entity39 , writing for the majority , said the prayers are ceremonial and in keeping with the nation 's traditions
