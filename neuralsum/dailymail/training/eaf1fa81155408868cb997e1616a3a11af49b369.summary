by @entity0 they are the little darlings who look awfully cute in a photo , or when curled up asleep in a cot – but a lot less appealing at 30,000ft , crying loudly in the seat right next to you			2
and according to a new survey , almost seven in ten @entity8 dislike flying with babies so much that they would like to see child - free areas introduced on planes			1
oh lord , please not next to me : almost seven in ten @entity8 would like to see child - free zones on aircraft almost one in four @entity8 travellers – 39 per cent – believes that no - kid - zones should be installed as compulsory compartments on long - haul flights where people want to sleep			1
and nearly a third – 30 per cent – would go further and bring in such silent spaces on all flights , long - and short - haul , to ensure stress - free travels for non-parenting passengers			1
the survey was conducted by bookings website @entity29 , with 1,108 @entity8 consumers questioned as to what they hate most about air travel			1
and our dislike of noisy children and babies on planes runs deep , it seems			2
more than a third of us – 35 per cent – would pay extra to travel on a childless service			1
long - haul passengers would be prepared to cough up an additional £ 63 to the cost of a return ticket if it meant adults only on board			1
and on short - haul flights , an extra £ 28 on the price of a return fare would be deemed good value if it guaranteed an absence of toddlers having tantrums in the middle of the economy - class aisle			1
imperfect passengers : babies on planes are the pet peeve of 43 per cent of @entity8 travellers - although passengers who invade your personal space on board are barely more popular , criticised by 31 per cent of us however , screaming infants are not the only source of frustration for @entity8 travellers			1
in fact , according to the research , a bawling baby ranks as only the fourth most irritating category of nightmare airline passenger			2

1,108 @entity8 consumers were questioned , and asked to pick three options from the list as pet peeves asked ‘ which of the following are the most annoying on a long flight ? ’ , well over half of respondents – 58 per cent – selected ‘ drunk and rowdy travellers ’ as their pet peeve			1
people with ‘ bad personal hygiene ’ and travellers who kick the back of the seat in front were also near the top of the list , causing anger to 48 and 47 per cent of us respectively			1
overweight flyers who invade other people ’s space were the fifth most disliked passenger , flagged as a cause of exasperation by 31 per cent of respondees			0
crying babies came in at fourth on the list , a bête noire for 43 per cent of those surveyed			0
‘ if you run into a screaming baby – or a noisy , hyperactive toddler and its exasperated parents – on a train , you can just move carriages , ’ says @entity124 of @entity29			0
‘ the same does not apply to a flight			2
‘ if you are sitting next to a family with kids that ca n’t settle down , there is nowhere to go			0
‘ while most people are sympathetic towards parents with young children , many people simply do n’t want so sit next to them – which is why the majority would like to see child - free zones on planes , and more than a third even want child - free planes			1
’ other causes of aggravation revealed in the survey included people who hog the armrest between seats ( nominated by 14 per cent of those questioned ) , people who snore ( 10 per cent ) and rude cabin crew ( nine per cent ) .			0

the majority of @entity8 travellers wish to see child - free areas on aircraft
more than a third of us would pay extra to be on a flight without children
drunk passengers and seat - kickers also *feature* on our flight hate lists
