@entity0 believes @entity1 are showing the fighting spirit necessary to qualify for the @entity3 as they head into sunday 's seismic showdown with @entity5 at @entity6			1
@entity7 ' in - form @entity8 survived a first - half fright at @entity10 on monday night before emerging 1 - 0 winners to cut the gap on fourth - placed @entity5 to two points			1
@entity0 had to produce fine stops to deny @entity15 and @entity16 in a first half @entity10 dominated but @entity19 's fortunate winner gave @entity1 their fifth successive @entity21 victory			1
@entity1 goalkeeper @entity0 punches a cross clear during his side 's 1 - 0 win against @entity10 captain @entity25 congratulates @entity0 after the @entity8 ' fifth successive @entity21 victory ' we showed the character and resilience during the game that you need if you 're going to be successful , ' @entity0 said			1
' this was our sixth successive clean sheet away from home and we have to keep that going until the end of the season			1
' you keep those clean sheets as a whole team			2
everyone is playing together , doing their job and willing to fight for each other			0
' @entity1 have not lost in the league since a 3 - 0 defeat at @entity5 on december 14 when the stuttering @entity0 was dropped and replaced by @entity44			1
but @entity0 soon reclaimed his place and both he and @entity1 have gone from strength to strength ever since , the @entity48 now unbeaten in 13 league games and @entity7 insisting they can catch second - placed @entity50 who are currently four points better off than his men			1
@entity5 's visit on sunday might go a long way to determining if that ambition is feasible but @entity0 insists @entity1 have to focus solely on themselves and not their rivals for a top - four spot			1
@entity1 's players celebrate after @entity19 's decisive second half goal at the @entity61 @entity0 pulls off an acrobatic save to deny @entity10 midfielder @entity16 a goal ' this win sets up the next game and that 's a big game of course , ' @entity0 said			1
' but we do n't have to make too much of it , there 's three points there and we have to try to do our best to get the win at home			2
' we just have to look at our own performances , there 's no point in looking at the other teams , and keep doing what we 've been doing in the last few months			2
' we 've still got all the big teams to play but the important thing is we do n't look too forward ahead of ourselves			0
' @entity0 does not resemble the goalkeeper who visibly appeared anxious and made regular mistakes during the first half of the season			2
as well as his precious first - half saves at the @entity61 he was commanding in the air and punched well under pressure , but he puts his impressive record down to those in front of him			0
' as a goalkeeper you 're depending on the rest of the team to keep those clean sheets , ' he said			0
' you ca n't do that on your own and that 's what 's pleasing			0
@entity19 scores the only goal of the game as the ball cannons off his shin fortuitously the @entity103 midfielder celebrates in front of @entity1 's travelling contingent at the @entity61 ' everybody 's doing their job , is organised and that makes life easy for a goalkeeper			1
' we had to fight at @entity10 to get through to 0 - 0 at half - time but the second half we got the goal and that came with putting a lot more pressure on the ball			0
' @entity10 defender @entity120 felt @entity122 's side paid the price for failing to turn their first - half superiority into a lead			0
the @entity126 played an unwitting role in @entity19 's winner as his attempted clearance clattered off the @entity1 midfielder and flew over @entity131 in the @entity10 goal			2
' it was an unlucky goal for us , ' said @entity120 , who was making his first league start since september after @entity136 had returned home to his native @entity138 to attend personal matters			0
' i do n't know what happened because i was on the floor but i think we deserved a draw			0
' we were playing very well in the first half but we could n't score one or two goals			0
' in the second half we suffered a little bit and we have to analyse that to see what happened			0
