by @entity0 and @entity1 tv presenter @entity2 has bemoaned a lack of ' @entity4 ' and claimed the victims of the @entity7 storms were ' spoilt ' for getting compensation not only is she said to be worth millions but she also has a choice of three homes to retreat to			1
so @entity2 probably should have kept quiet when it came to the subject of the misery of the @entity7 storms			1
the tv presenter believes victims of treacherous weather are ‘ spoilt ’ if they receive compensation for losing their power supply for days over the festive period			1
the star of @entity22 ’s @entity20 bemoaned the lack of ‘ @entity4 ’ and said that billions of people around the world get by with ‘ limited electricity ’			1
miss @entity2 , 42 , told her 331,000 followers on @entity27 that she was in ‘ rant mode ’ as many families face a seventh night without power			1
the mother - of - two wrote : ‘ what on @entity35 has happened to @entity4 ? # @entity36 ... @entity38 winds blow , trees come down , electricity goes off , it ’s not much fun , need to make contingency plans , why does this mean compensation ? ’ unsurprisingly , other @entity27 users were quick to hit back at her lack of sympathy			1
one wrote : ‘ something tells me you were not affected ? ’ while another said : ‘ quite right people are just spoilt			1
they ’ll feel entitled to shelter , food and water next ! ’ energy companies have been criticised for their slow reaction to storm damage			1
her comments ignited controversy on @entity27 , with one person writing : ' something tells me you were not affected ? ' while another added : ' quite right @ @entity65 , people are just spoilt			1
they ’ll feel entitled to shelter , food and water next ! ' another joked about the @entity70 presenter : ' on the bright side , these floods will help give that fabulous distressed look to furniture			1
one @entity27 user added : ' i ’m no expert , but i have n’t noticed us being at war with @entity78 , or you know , an actual blitz happening			1
' another replied to @entity82 , whose father @entity83 , was a chairman of @entity85 : ' so say you via @entity27 ... doing that without electricity are you ? ! ' to which @entity82 replied : ' @entity89 is if i could n’t tweet because of a storm i would n’t be seeking compensation , things happen , less whinging more doing			1
' @entity2 said billions of people around the world get by with ' limited electricity ' and questioned why the storms should lead to compensation her comments came as many faced yet another day without power today , a week after they were cut off , despite claims by engineers the last homes had been reconnected network bosses meanwhile have admitted they failed to ensure enough engineers were working over the festive period to repair the damage and were today urged to cancel @entity107 holidays as more storms approach			1
it came as another storm of heavy rain and strong winds arrives in the @entity114 , bringing with it a risk of flooding and disruption			1
the executive of one of the @entity114 's biggest power distributors has admitted its efforts to restore power to thousands of people should have been better			1
@entity125 , chief executive of the @entity126 , has said it was not prepared for the storm and too many staff were on holiday @entity125 , chief executive of the @entity126 , has admitted it was not prepared for the storm and too many staff were on holiday			1
the company , which owns electricity lines and cables in @entity138 , the south east and east of @entity139 , said it will increase payments for 48 to 60 - hour outages from £ 27 to £ 75 for those affected on christmas day as ' a gesture of goodwill '			1
additional payments will be made to customers who have been without electricity for longer than that time - up to a maximum of £ 432			1
mr @entity125 said : ' we could not have avoided the damage caused by the storm but we could have responded to it better			1
' a lot of our employees had gone away for holidays so it meant we had a level of depletion in our resources - and that caused problems with getting people 's power restored			1
' it 's difficult to justify saying the company has performed well when customers have been without power for five days , but once we had an idea of how bad it was we were able to mobilise as many engineers and office staff as possible			2
' forecasters have said the latest storm pushing in from the @entity173 will cross the @entity114 from west to east today			2
the @entity174 has issued a severe weather warning over fears of strong gales of up to 80mph affecting @entity178 , southern , western and northern @entity139 and @entity179			2
it has also warned of the danger of ice patches in the south west tonight as temperatures drop to below freezing			2
the @entity174 has issued a severe weather warning over fears of strong gales of up to 80mph affecting @entity178 , southern , western and northern @entity139 and @entity179 today with more storms through the week @entity187 , a forecaster for @entity188 , said : ' normally , we would say this is a typical winter storm but because we 're still recovering from a string of other storms it is likely to cause more disruption and flooding			2
' he said the south west will continue to bear the brunt of the storm			2
the @entity200 ( @entity200 ) have around 100 flood alerts in place in southern , western and northern @entity139			2
@entity114 is braced for an entire month of bad weather that could see the number of homes flooded more than double			2
as the big clean - up gets under way in the aftermath of the @entity7 storms , persistent rain will sweep across the country today and return to drench @entity215 revellers			2
then from @entity219 , storms and rain can be expected for the foreseeable future , forecasters warn			2
‘ there is no end in sight , ’ said a @entity174 spokesman			0
the fresh wave of bad weather could see the figure for flooded homes double to more than 2,000 in the worst hit areas of @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231			0
the agency said persistent rainfall means there is a ‘ continued heightened flood risk ’ across southern @entity139 , particularly south west @entity139			0
some 70 flood alerts and five more serious flood warnings remain in place across the country			0
one warning is in place for @entity242 where the ground is still saturated after the @entity7 rain			0
much of the @entity246 town was submerged after the @entity248 and @entity249 rivers burst their banks last week			0
a spokesman for the @entity174 said : ‘ for as far as we can see , the wet and windy weather is here to stay			0
there is no end in sight			0
' we are in the middle of winter , so this weather is not unusual , but there is no sign of it settling down as we go into january			0
’ six people have died during the bad weather , while the bill for insurance companies is likely to top £ 100million			1
and the unsettled weather looks set to continue into the new year after the @entity174 issued a severe weather warning for rain on @entity219 , affecting southern @entity139 and western @entity179			0
some 1,300 properties have been flooded during the recent storms in @entity139 , the @entity200 said			0
meanwhile energy companies have been criticised for their slow reaction to storm damage			0
environment secretary @entity274 said he has pressed energy companies to stop staff taking new year holidays as a second week of storms looks set to derail the festive period			0
speaking on @entity280 's @entity279 programme , he said : ' i think some of them ( energy companies ) definitely let their customers down , and i 'm pleased to hear they are going to pay some compensation to those who are out of power			0
' we were told yesterday that the final 130 houses ( without power ) would all be back on by last night and i 'll have my daily meeting at nine when i hope to hear that has been achieved			0
' some of the companies have performed , some have not , and i think they have been penalised by the reaction of their customers			0
it 's up to them to compensate their customers			0
' we 've had two @entity297 ( the government 's emergency committee ) meetings over the last couple of days and we 've made it very clear that we expect them to take proper measures - not to let staff go away on holiday over the new year period and to be properly prepared for this week			0
' mr @entity274 added that emergency financial assistance - known as the @entity310 fund - could be made available to local authorities to ensure flood defences and power supplies remain intact			0
' it 's dreadful for all those involved but we do give credit to those in the @entity200 who worked throughout that period and who are working as we speak now , ' he said			0
' we 've had @entity297 meetings co-ordinating the other @entity299 departments , and local government has been told at every level that they must make sure they have adequate staff on over the new year period			0
' we 've also said the ' @entity310 ' can be triggered , which is an emergency fund where central government can come in and help			0
