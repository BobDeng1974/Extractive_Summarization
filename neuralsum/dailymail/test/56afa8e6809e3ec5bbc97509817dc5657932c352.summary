famished and queuing despondently as far as the eye can see , these images will have the @entity3 's slick propaganda unit spitting feathers			1
in scenes more familiar in the most impoverished refugee camps , scores of downtrodden @entity6 wait in line for hours for food in the terror group 's self - declared capital @entity13			1
it 's a far cry from the all - conquering image of prosperity its jihadi pr machine would like the world to believe			2
the pictures were posted on @entity20 by a member of the @entity22 campaign group @entity13 is being slaughtered silently who risk their lives every day by documenting atrocities from inside the city			1
yes this is the # @entity48			2
hunger , poverty and homelessness			1
' for those lucky enough to have a home , he paints a bleak picture of life spent in the dark and cold for hours on end			2
' the city suffers from a shortage of electricity where the power goes off for 21 hours in the day , ' he wrote in another tweet			2
@entity63 prides itself on its well - oiled propaganda offensive , pumping out images , videos and even a weekly @entity67 designed to recruit and radicalise would - be jihadists			0
co-ordinated by its @entity69 , the terror group makes extensive use of social media to keep in near - constant contact with supporters in the @entity75 - even selling branded merchandise such as t - shirts , baseball caps and cuddly toys			1
but as seen here , that ease of disseminating information can easily backfire			0
most of the @entity6 in this line appear to be woman and children			1
the pictures were posted on @entity20 by the @entity22 group @entity13 is being slaughtered silently who risk their lives leaking information from the city the food queue pictures emerged days after @entity63 took their draconian rule to bizarre new levels by threatening to jail any man caught wearing skinny jeans in an apparent crackdown on hipsters			1
the terror group said it would also imprison anyone caught with music on their mobiles , smoking or turning up late for prayer in the city			1
violators will be jailed for ten days , during which time they will be made to take an ' @entity108 course '			2
at the end of their prison term , they will be forced to take a test , with those who pass being released immediately			0
those who do n't will be fined and kept in prison until they do			0
other sickening sentences involve people being stoned to death for alleged adultery and thrown off buildings after being accused of being homosexual			0
bleak picture : @entity40 one of the group 's founders , wrote the accompanying message : ' lines waiting for some food			1
yes this is the # @entity48			0
hunger , poverty and homelessness ' one resident , named only as @entity135 , told the group how dozens of people had fled the city in the wake of the jihadi network 's brutal enforcement of its twisted form of sharia law			1
he said : ' @entity63 tightens penalties and uses the principle of intimidation in dealing with public , which led to the migration and escape of many people			0
freedom of expression has become a crime			0
' in a separate development , @entity63 has announced that all nurses working in areas under their control must speak @entity159 - something the @entity160 still has n't introduced			0
revealing plans to open a school of nursing in @entity13 , the extremists also disclosed the tough entry requirements for prospective medical workers			0
among them are rules that applicants are no more than 25 years of age , must be willing to work anywhere inside the territory controlled by the extremists , and must speak fluent @entity159			2
the latter rule is something that even the @entity160 has yet fully put in place , with nurses who trained in @entity179 countries still able to treat patients without any formal language checks thanks to bureaucratic rules barring the @entity183 testing @entity185 candidates .			0
