by @entity0 published : 09:46 est , 10 april 2012 updated : 03:49 est , 11 april 2012 when a 38 - stone unemployed woman was given an £ 8,000 gastric sleeve operation on the @entity4 , she knew she had been given the golden chance to turn her life around			1
but now @entity7 is now set to undergo a further £ 15,000 gastric bypass to help her lose weight and £ 12,000 worth cosmetic surgery			1
the 28 - year - old complained that after slimming down to 20 stone because she had a gastric sleeve fitted , she lost her disability benefits because she was no longer fat enough to claim			1
food for thought : jobless @entity7 , 28 , who will undergo a £ 15,000 gastric bypass at taxpayers ' expense - three years after moaning that her disability benefit was being cut after her last operation left with ' just ' £ 600 in handouts to live on each month , she moaned that she was unable to afford healthy food			1
now , three years after she was first operated on , the junk food fan from @entity25 , @entity26 , continues to eat chocolate and crisps every day			1
she is booked in for surgery so she can have a £ 15,000 taxpayer - funded gastric bypass			1
and then she expects to receive a further £ 12,000 worth of cosmetic work to improve the look of her body			2
she will undergo arm and thigh lifts and a tummy tuck			0
junk food fan : @entity7 continues to eat crisps and chocolate bars every day but says she will stop if she undergoes a new gastric band operation weight loss : @entity7 is now set to undergo a further £ 27,000 worth of surgery to help her lose weight this will bring the final cost of her medical treatment to £ 35,000			1
this time she hopes her weight problem will finally be brought under control			0
@entity7 claims all the surgery is vital as she does not have the willpower to slim down by herself			2
she told closer magazine : ' some people might say i do n’t deserve the second operation , but i do			0
it ’s not my fault			0
i crave chocolate like every other woman			0
' i always allow myself a few treats a day - usually two packets of @entity61 and a chocolate bar at night			2
' @entity7 believes that , since the sleeve was fitted , her stomach has gradually stretched and this has meant she has been eating more			1
she says she lost weight in advance of the sleeve op , but does not have the strength of mind to do it again			2
' i sometimes feel guilty about all the money that has been spent on me , ' she said			0
' but , after the bypass , i could be 16st by @entity72			0
then i wo n’t eat crisps or chocolate			1
' after she had the original operation , @entity7 complained that because she had lost so much weight she no longer qualified for £ 340 per month in disability benefits - so could n't afford to eat healthily			1
at the time she said : ' i ca n't afford to buy @entity80 crisps and cereal bars any more so i eat @entity83 's chocolate bars and packets of @entity86 crisps , sometimes four of each a day			1
' people ask why i do n't snack on an apple - they 're cheap , but emotionally i do n't always feel like an apple			0
' @entity7 's decision to have further medical treatment has enraged @entity93 from the @entity94			2
he said : ' @entity7 would have been told what to eat after her gastric sleeve , but she has ignored advice and gone back to her old ways			1
' the @entity4 came to her aid when it was necessary			0
but now she is scrounging off the system and could be denying surgery to someone with a life - threatening illness like cancer			0
' @entity7 , who is a vegetarian , claims her typical daily diet would be @entity107 for breakfast , jacket potato with beans for lunch and spaghetti with @entity113 for dinner			2
but she admits that , once a week , she has two slices of toast for breakfast and treats herself to a salad wrap			0
@entity7 says she feels guilty about living off the state			2
she added : ' once i have lost the weight , i want to train to be a hairdresser			0
i do n’t want to live off the state			0
i plan to get married and show off my new figure in a wedding gown			0
' obese : @entity7 , now 28 , who weighed 38 - stone before she underwent an £ 8,000 gastric sleeve operation on the @entity4			1

@entity7 , 28 , *sparked* fury by claiming she could not afford to eat healthy food on £ 600 per month benefits
she continues to eat crisps and chocolate every day after undergoing a gastric sleeve operation three years *ago*
now she will undergo a further £ 27,000 of work to bring her weight down
