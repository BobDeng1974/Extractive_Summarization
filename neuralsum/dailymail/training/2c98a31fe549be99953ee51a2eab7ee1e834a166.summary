long before man ventured into space , our canine companions were testing the water for us			2
to assess the then unknown effects of low gravity and forces during launch on living things , @entity6 scientists made these high - pressure suits to help keep dogs safe during experiments in the 1950s			1
they were strapped into what might be considered today as a rather crude contraption , put into a rocket and fired 80km to the edge of space before returning to @entity20 by parachute			2
like a giant boot : this space suit was among the first made for dogs for experiments on the effects of low gravity and high - speed launches on living things to boldly go : this picture taken in 1959 shows a dog preparing for launch from a @entity34 base in @entity35 the lessons learned paved the way for @entity39 's mission in 1957 , when she became the first animal to orbit the @entity20 , and subsequently the first journeys into space by humans a few years later			1
unfortunately , only a few suits have remained intact over the years			0
one , a brown , lace - up suit complete with a dog 's head - shaped helmet and breathing apparatus , is currently on display at the @entity51 in @entity52			2
speaking when it first arrived at the centre in 2010 , @entity53 , the @entity54 , told the @entity57 : ' at the beginning of the space race , no - one knew how the human body would respond to being in low gravity , high altitude and the forces exerted during launch			2
pioneering pooch : @entity39 , who became the first animal to orbit the @entity20 in 1957 , with her handler final frontier : for years , it had been reported that @entity39 ( pictured on board the @entity73 satellite ) survived for six days until her oxygen ran out , but in 2002 it emerged that she likely perished within hours after launch ' so animals were used to test the reactions to these			1
most of the dogs did survive			0
there were only a couple of accidents where dogs died			0
' @entity6 scientists chose dogs , most of them strays from the streets of @entity90 , because they felt they were better able to sit still for long periods than primates			0
the @entity94 , on the other hand , preferred chimpanzees because of their similarity to humans			0
being enclosed in these suits that effectively wrapped them up like a giant boot must have been terrifying , but mr @entity53 said many of the dogs seemed quite happy after they had landed back on @entity20			1
canine cosmonaut : @entity103 , a @entity6 space dog , poses here in its snug - fitting space suit with a transparent space helmet beside it in 1957 one giant leap for canine kind : two @entity6 ' spacedogs ' @entity112 ( left ) and @entity113 wearing their space suits shortly after they were in orbit for 22 days in 1966 he said : ' i 've seen original footage of the dogs being collected when they parachute back down and they seem very excited to see their owners			1
' @entity39 , a stray @entity6 dog , became the first animal to orbit the earth in november 1957 aboard the @entity73 satellite , but died during the mission			0
it had for years been reported that she survived for six days until her oxygen ran out , but in 2002 it emerged that she likely perished from overheating within hours after launch			0
four years later , @entity6 cosmonaut @entity132 became the first human to orbit the @entity20 aboard @entity134 , closely followed by @entity94 @entity135 a month after that .			1
