by @entity0 fruit fly ovaries or a fungus garden do n't automatically spring to mind when imagining objects of beauty			2
but to a scientist , seeing these strange and fascinating specimens in detail can reveal unexpected patterns of beauty			2
and now anyone can see the same stunning patterns as part of an annual exhibition held by @entity16 in @entity17 , which highlights the art in science			1
what does a fish see when it schools with others ? in this @entity25 , the visual field is shown for one fish in a school			2
the field of view of the left eye is seen in red and the right in blue			2
the areas of overlap are shown in purple			0
the video illustrates the fact that a fish can see far more than a few nearest neighbours the exhibit consists of both still images and video of artistic merit created during the course of scientific research			1
the idea is to spur debate among artists about the nature of art and open scientists to new ways of ' seeing ' their own research			2
it also hopes to open a window through which the general public can appreciate both art and science - two fields that for differing reasons can feel threatening to the non-expert			2
this image won first place and is the work of @entity16 postdoctoral researcher @entity64			1
named ' watermarks , ' the images traces the complex patterns created by water moving back and forth on @entity17 's @entity70 coast microtubules are hollow filaments that serve as the skeleton of the cell			1
they were thought to grow linearly , but this @entity25 shows that they can branch : microtubules ( red with growing tips in green ) grow off the wall of existing microtubules ' @entity80 in the @entity81 ' won third prize in the art of science competition			1
the image was taken during a 20 - second blast of air that removes tiny pieces of debris when scientists enter the clean room shown here are fungus - growing ants and the fungus garden they cultivate in a colony from the @entity96 of @entity17			1
the interaction between ant workers and the growing fungus creates dynamic living structure , seen here growing in a time - lapse video over the course of ten days @entity64 , a postdoctoral student in @entity103 came first with her image dubbed ' @entity66 '			1
the image traces the complex patterns created by water moving back and forth on @entity17 's @entity70 coast			1
second place went to @entity110 for his ' fungus among us ' the image shows a microscopic view of a fungus growing on debris within an ant colony			1
@entity120 , graduate student , @entity119 came third with ' portrait of the artist in the air shower '			0
the image was taken during a 20 - second blast of air that removes tiny pieces of debris when scientists enter the clean room			1
‘ @entity133 imagery has universal appeal , across cultures , languages , and age groups , ’ the organisers claim			1
‘ powerful imaging tools can now capture our world in ways never before contemplated and unintentionally produce aesthetically interesting visual effects			0
‘ when viewed through the lens of art , these images can further man ’s concept of what it means to be human , enhance our appreciation of the natural world , and enrich our cultural heritage			1
’ forty - four still images and 12 videos were chosen from more than 30 submissions from undergraduates , graduate students , postdocs , staff , and alumni			2
@entity160 , a graduate student in molecular biology and one of the 2014 organizers , explained that the exhibit highlights the interplay between art and science			0
' while the scientific methods behind the exhibit strive for objectivity and consensus , everyone ’s individual response to the images is subjective and highly personal , ' he said			0
@entity64 , a postdoc in @entity103 came first with her image dubbed ' @entity66 '			0
second place went to @entity110 , a student in @entity177 for his ' fungus among us ' the image shows a microscopic view of a fungus growing on debris within an ant colony			1
the image of a ' @entity187 ' shows cross sections of ten ovaries from a female fruit fly			0
each ovary acts as an ' assembly line , ' with each egg ( yellow circles ) being formed as it works its way to the larger end of the ovary			0
the image was created by @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , and @entity202 ' @entity203 ' - pictured on the left is a microscopic view of a fungus growing on debris within an ant colony			1
the white areas transport nutrients between the reproductive spores ( brown )			0
on the right is an image of an ant hiding in one of the fittings designed to measure its respirometry system this piece , titled ' @entity220 , shows a close up of the protective coatings of hydroxyapatite that are durable , but invisible			1
to control the growth of the mineral , researcehrs add a polymer ( polyacrylic acid ) , which adsorbs on the growing crystal			0
in this image , the polyacrylic acid particles show exotic forms the title of this image paraphrases @entity236 's declaration : ' it is not birth , marriage , or death , but gastrulation , which is truly the most important time in your life			1
' ' @entity244 ' is the process by which , through coordinated cell shape changes and movements , an embryo takes form			0
this image shows a transverse view through a gastrulating fruit fly embryo @entity120 , graduate student , @entity119 came third with ' portrait of the artist in the air shower '			1
the image was taken during a 20 - second blast of air that removes tiny pieces of debris when scientists enter the clean room			2
this is the seventh @entity264 of science competition but the first to include a category of video			2
the top video award was a @entity270 camera , awarded to @entity271 , assistant professor of molecular biology , for ' microtubules branch out			0
' ' so much of science and engineering involves video or animation these days that it was inevitable we would include it in @entity280 , ' said @entity281 , a graduate student in mechanical and aerospace engineering who is one of the 2014 exhibit organisers			0
' since a picture is worth a thousand words , video is worth approximately 30,000 words per second , so adding a video component to @entity280 was a no - brainer			0
' those attending the opening reception for the physical gallery in may were also asked to fill out a paper ' @entity295 ' ballot			0
of 185 ballots cast , 1st place for the still image went to ' fruit fly factory ' by @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 , of @entity300 and @entity301			2
@entity302 for video went to ' @entity304 ' by @entity305 and @entity306			0
the physical gallery of the 2014 exhibit will be on view in the @entity310 on the @entity16 campus through the end of april 2015			1
the ' @entity314 ' image on the left shows a group of beetles playing in a shower of flour as scientists investigate how parasites , which infect the beetles , change their metabolic rate			0
on the right is the @entity326 pika , sometimes thought of as the ' canary ' of climate change as its absence reveals temperature fluctuations observing this green algae leaf under a standard microscope only reveal limited detail , as conventional images are flat and two - dimensional			0
but thisimage here shows a volume slice of the leaf : two cell layers			0
one highlighted in blue and the other in green a @entity343 coil takes is pictured in ' now that i have your attention , ' a photo created by by @entity345 , manager of undergraduate labs at @entity16 and graduate alumnus @entity347			1
this imagescaptures the plasma filaments that discharge when high voltage is applied to the coil			0

the images are part of the ' art of @entity133 ' exhibition being held by @entity16 in @entity17
winner of the image category showed complex patterns created by water moving over the @entity70 coast
second place went to an image of a microscopic view of a fungus growing on debris within an ant colony
there was also a video category which featured images of a fish 's line of sight and cells branching out
