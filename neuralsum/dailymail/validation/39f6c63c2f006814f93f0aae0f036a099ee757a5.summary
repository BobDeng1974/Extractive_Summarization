the deep bass tones of singer @entity1 have become synonymous with seduction among humans , but it appears horses find deep voices sexy too			1
a new study has found that female horses are more attracted stallions with deeper , lower pitched whinnies			1
the lower frequency ' voices ' of stallions tended to be associated with larger males , who had a calmer temperament and their offspring tended to survive for longer			1
and just like humans putting on an album featuring @entity1 's bass - baritone voice , the deeper whinnies from male horses also appear to get the mares more in the mood			1
the researchers say the findings could also be used to help horse breeders select the best stallions for mating in the future			1
the domestication of the horse some 5,500 years ago ultimately revolutionized human civilization and societies			0
horses facilitated transportation as well as the circulation of ideas , languages and religions			0
horses also revolutionized warfare with the advent of chariotry and mounted cavalry and beyond the battlefield horses greatly stimulated agriculture			0
however , the domestication of the horse and the subsequent encroachment of human civilization also resulted in the near extinction of wild horses			2
the only surviving wild horse population , the @entity66 's horses from @entity67 , descends from mere 13 individuals , preserved only through a massive conservation effort			2
as a consequence of this massive loss of genetic diversity , the effects of horse domestication through times have been difficult to unravel on a molecular level			0
professor @entity78 , a biologist at the @entity79 in @entity80 , said : ' the lower pitched the stallion 's voice , the slower its heart beat and the higher its reproductive success			1
' stallion acoustic signals may play a role in female attraction at the time of group formation , as well as a role in sexual stimulation or libido maintenance when a group is formed			0
' this supports preliminary findings showing that females base their approach preference towards certain unfamiliar males on the amount of vocal signals uttered during their first encounter and some male vocal signals trigger mare behavioural preparation for mating , for example tail lifting and leg parting			2
' in the wild , horses tend to live in harems consisting of one to two male adults and two to three females who have established stable bonds			2
when female juveniles reach sexual maturity they leave their group and form their own harem with bachelor males or join an existing harem			0
this may explain why ' voice ' has become such an important characteristic in horses as females will often choose which harem to join from a long way off			0
@entity127 is an effective way for males to convey information to prospective mates and may be a way of avoiding the often violent fights that wild male rivals can engage in to win a mate			0
in a study published in the journal @entity138 , professor @entity78 and his colleagues recorded the calls of 15 breeding stallions from stud farms around @entity80			1
the singer @entity1 was known as the @entity145 due to his deep voice and reputation for singing romantic songs , but it seems he may have been copying a style of seduction already employed by male horses they took blood and sperm samples from each of the horses and measured their heart beat			1
the researchers then played the recordings to 40 adult mares aged between seven and 27 years old at the @entity161 in @entity80			1
the females were placed in a corridor with a speaker at either end , through which a pair of whinnies from different stallions were played			1
the researchers found that the females tended to move with preference towards the speak playing the deeper whinnie			0
they also found that the males with deeper whinnies tended to be larger - suggesting they were stronger and so better able to protect the harem			1
male stallions will often show off in an attempt to win a mate but it seems their whinnie is also important they also had slower heart beats , meaning they were calmer and fewer of their offspring tended to die before or shortly after birth			1
professor @entity78 told @entity188 : ' @entity189 potentially convey a mix of information about the sexual and social qualities of a male			0
' in the wild , mares stay all your long with stallions , so finding the best social partner - dominant , calm and fertile - may be important			2
' the preference among female horses for deep voices is not unique			2
female humans have been found to find men with lower voices more attractive			0
koalas , bison and giant pandas have also been found to be more attracted to males with deeper calls			0
professor @entity78 added : ' our data also confirm that not all male voices are equally attractive , opening new lines of bioacoustic research on mammal reproduction			0

**scientists** at the @entity79 , @entity80 , recorded stallions ' whinnies
mares were drawn to deeper whinnies when played back through speakers
male horses with deeper voices were large , calmer and had higher fertility
**scientists** say the findings could help horse breeders pick better stallions
