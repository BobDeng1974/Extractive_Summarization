this will contain 30 per cent fewer calories and , instead of being added as a mid-calorie addition to the @entity2 range , it will completely replace the current @entity2 , ' it read			0
' @entity29 , a sweetener from natural origins , is sweeter than sugar but without the calories			1
' it is an extract from the leaf of the stevia plant which is native to @entity42			2
stevia has been used for centuries as a source of intense , natural sweetness			0
' the herbal sweetener , @entity29 , is already available in the @entity49 version of @entity2			1
a plant used for centuries by @entity42 's @entity53 , it has shot from relative obscurity to being used as a key sweetener by large companies such as @entity17 and @entity57 in just a few years			1

the lemon and lime drink contains 65 calories and 15.9g of sugar in each 150ml can			0
