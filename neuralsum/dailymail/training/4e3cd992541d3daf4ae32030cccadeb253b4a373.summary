@entity0 , the @entity1 artist who created dozens of ceramic poppies for the @entity4 installation has received death threats because proceeds will be donated to military charities the artist who created the sea of ceramic poppies at the @entity4 has revealed he received death threats over the project			1
@entity0 created 888,246 poppies to be placed outside the @entity4 to remember all those who died in @entity14 for the @entity16 installation			1
but despite the success of the project , which saw thousands of people visit , mr @entity0 said he has received threatening phone calls and letters after it was announced that some of the proceeds from selling poppies would go to armed forces charities			1
around £ 10million has been raised for six military charities - including @entity28 and the @entity29 - from the sale of the poppies , for around £ 31 each			2
but it appeared news of the fundraising angered some people and mr @entity0 , of @entity1 , has received threats by email , letter and phone			1
' even the police got involved , ' he told the @entity41			0
' i suppose , because they felt that the money was going to charities which in some way were involved in the war			0
' mr @entity0 was made an mbe in the new years honours list for his role making the ceramic poppies for the installation			2
it was designed by @entity54 , at his @entity1 workshop			0
the @entity4 installation earned mr @entity0 such acclaim he has been approached about other similar projects around the world			2
but mr @entity0 has remained tight lipped about the precise location , which will be announced next month			0
the artist will be involved in another project with flowers in @entity70 in 2017 and then another in 2018 in a ' very distant country			0
' the 888,246 ceramic poppies almost filled the moat at the @entity4 for the @entity14 installation organisers warned people not to visit the installation after millions of people queued for hours to see it around 150,000 people are still waiting for to receive their ceramic poppies from the installation and mr @entity0 has offered to replace those flowers that were delivered cracked			1
the poppies were hand - made in a painstaking operation by a small team and twice fired in mr @entity0 ’ studio in @entity1			1
it then took around four months for them to be installed and the ceramic flowers almost filled the tower 's 16 - acre moat			0
mr @entity0 said the popularity of the installation was boosted by royal visits , including from the @entity96 and @entity97 and prince @entity98 who visited in the early days of the project the ceramic poppies were sold for £ 31 each , including packing and posting , and some are still being sent mr @entity0 said the success of the poppy installation surprised him , but he believes royal visits by the @entity96 and @entity97 and prince @entity98 early on helped to increase its popularity			1
the @entity110 and prince @entity111 visited the installation later in october			0
the artist opposed proposals by @entity115 , mayor of @entity116 , for the poppies to remain at the @entity4 for a number of months because he said he did not want the work to become a strange tourist attraction .			0
