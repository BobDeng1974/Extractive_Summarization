by @entity0 bullying and campaigns of abuse were ‘ endemic ’ in a secretive police union which ‘ cynically exploited ’ the @entity6 scandal , a damning report reveals today			2
hardline members of the @entity9 ‘ disgracefully ’ hounded senior officers , threatened dissenting staff with the sack and used ‘ guerrilla ’ tactics to halt government plans to shake - up pay and conditions , it says			1
federation chairmen and politicians - including home secretary @entity20 - routinely suffered ‘ personalised ’ attacks from militant officials determined to scupper sweeping reforms			1
hardline members of the @entity9 , pictured , ' disgracefully ' hounded senior officers , threatened dissenting staff with the sack and used ' guerrilla ' tactics to halt government plans to shake - up pay and conditions , the report says important business was discussed ‘ aggressively , in public , at 10 o’clock at night after a considerable amount of alcohol had been consumed ’ , a whistleblower told the @entity36			1
the cross-party panel of mps also criticises the @entity9 for ‘ unnecessarily ’ stashing £ 70million of members ’ money - including some in hidden so - called ‘ @entity41 ’ held by local branches - and hand back £ 120 each police officers			1
and the committee warns if the notorious organisation - effectively a union - fails to reform , it would be ‘ derelict ’ of the government not to introduce tough new laws			0
police minister @entity50 has already fired a shot across the bows of the organisation - representing 125,000 rank - and - file officers - by ordering it to act ‘ in the interests both of the police and the public ’ to avoid legislation			2
the scathing report comes ahead of the @entity9 ’s annual conference in @entity62 next week			1
members will vote on a package of reforms recommended in an independent review by @entity69 mandarin sir @entity67			2
the @entity9 is still reeling from the fallout from @entity6 which led to the resignation of @entity73 chief whip @entity72 , its political campaigning and the @entity76 ’s revelations about ‘ extravagant ’ credit card spending and off - shore accounts			1
a survey of rank - and - file officers found almost 75 per cent thought the @entity9 did a ‘ poor job ’ speaking up for members and 91 per cent said it ‘ should change ’			1
federation chairmen and politicians - including home secretary @entity20 , pictured , - routinely suffered ' personalised ' attacks from militant officials determined to scupper sweeping reforms the 23 - page report said the @entity9 had treated successive national chairmen - including outgoing @entity90 and @entity91 , who died last year - ‘ quite disgracefully ’			1
they endured ‘ persistent attempts to undermine and destabilise ... by bullying and personal attacks ’			0
in a letter written to the @entity9 ’s 30 - strong top committee , mr @entity90 wrote that he had ‘ continually been criticised , ridiculed and verbally ridiculed ... and my integrity questioned ’ over his stance on the @entity101			1
he added : ‘ whilst accepting emotions are running high in the advent of inevitable change , at times i have genuinely felt that i have been gratuitously and cruelly bullied and humiliated			0
’ the report said chairmen trying to implement reforms became ‘ enmired in interminable , internecine power - struggles which would not have been out of place in a medieval court			1
’ mps also attacked the @entity9 ’s decision to appoint a controversial public relations firm run by former radio ‘ shock jock ’ @entity116 - the son of a policeman - as a ‘ serious error of judgment ’			1
the organisation secretly paid £ 10,000 - a - month for advice on using ‘ guerrilla tactics ’ against the government weeks before the @entity6 scandal			0
the hostile media strategy called for a military - style ‘ blitzkrieg ’ to halt radical change			0
in september 2012 , then chief whip mr @entity72 and a policeman clashed at the gates of @entity131			0
mr @entity72 was accused of calling police officers ‘ f * * * * * * plebs ’ - something he has always vehemently denied			0
he has insisted the row was hijacked by @entity9 officials for political ends			2
@entity139 , the committee 's @entity140 chairman , said : ' we were shocked by the scale of bullying that we found at the @entity9 's headquarters ' earlier this month , mr @entity116 admitted he saw the @entity6 affair as an ‘ absolutely fantastic ’ opportunity to promote the police agenda			1
but the strategy backfired because three officers who called for mr @entity72 ’s resignation following the incident have been sacked and a fourth , pc @entity154 , 53 , was jailed for misconduct after admitting lying about witnessing the row			0
branding the contract with mr @entity116 ‘ inappropriate ’ , the committee said he had ‘ damaged , rather than enhance ’ the organisation ’s reputation			0
it said : ‘ mr @entity116 cynically sought to exploit the @entity6 incident as part of a manipulative media strategy which included what he described as “ blitzkrieg ” and “ guerrilla ” tactics			0
this entire episode does the @entity9 no credit at all			2
’ the report follows a string of revelations by the @entity76 on accusations of bullying and lavish spending by the @entity9			1
concerns were raised over significant amounts of money put through on corporate @entity181 credit cards , with some four - figure bills believed to have come after a conference organised by the @entity184 last november			0
officials were also accused of bullying at the @entity9 ’s plush £ 26million headquarters in @entity187 , @entity188 , which was built in 2007 and boasts a 55 - room hotel with a bar , swimming pool and 11 two - bedroom grace - and - favour apartments			2
@entity139 , the committee ’s @entity140 chairman , said : ‘ we were shocked by the scale of bullying that we found at the @entity9 ’s headquarters			2
it rivals any popular soap opera			0
‘ it is disgraceful that any chairman should have been hounded out for championing long - overdue reforms			0
’ he added : ‘ our police service is the best in the world but its reputation has been extensively damaged by the federation suffering a sustained period of self - inflicted harm			0
