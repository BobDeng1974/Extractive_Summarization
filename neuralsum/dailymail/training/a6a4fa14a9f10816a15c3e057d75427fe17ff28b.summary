invisibility may still be the stuff of fictional works like @entity3 , but researchers in @entity5 have developed a way to make mice almost totally transparent			1
using a method that almost completely removes color from tissue - and kills the mouse in the process - researchers say they can now examine individual organs or even whole bodies without slicing into them , offering a ' bigger picture ' view of the problems they are working on			1
the techniques will give scientists a ' new understanding of the 3d structure of organs and how certain genes are expressed in various tissues , ' said @entity28 , the lead author of a research paper published in the @entity31 - based @entity30			2
exposed : this picture released from @entity5 research institute @entity33 on november 6 , 2014 shows a decolorized mouse body and some organs glowing with fluorescence protein at the @entity33 laboratory ' we were very surprised that the entire body of infant and adult mice could be made nearly transparent , ' he said in a statement issued by @entity5 research institute @entity33 and its collaborators the work , which also involved the @entity47 and the @entity48 , focuses on a compound called haem , the constituent that gives blood its red colour and is found in most tissues of the body			2
the process involves pumping a saline solution through the mouse 's heart , pushing the blood out of its circulatory system and killing the creature			1
a reagent is then introduced , which works to divorce the haem from the haemoglobin that remains in the animal 's organs			0
the dead mouse is skinned and soaked in the reagent for up to two weeks to complete the process			0
eerie : the process involves pumping a saline solution through the mouse 's heart , pushing the blood out of its circulatory system and killing the creature a sheet of laser light , which can be set to penetrate to a specific level , builds up a complete image of the body , much as a 3d printer creates physical objects in layers			1
' microscopes have so far allowed us to look at things in minute detail , but that has also deprived us of the context of what we are looking at , ' @entity28 told @entity94			0
the new method , which can not be applied to living things , ' will give us details while enabling us to grasp the bigger picture , ' he said			1
@entity98 , who led the research team , said in the statement that the method ' could be used to study how embryos develop or how cancer and autoimmune diseases develop at the cellular level			0
it was hoped the method would lead ' to a deeper understanding of such diseases and perhaps to new therapeutic strategies '			0
' it could lead to the achievement of one of our great dreams : organism - level systems biology based on whole - body imaging at single - cell resolution			0
