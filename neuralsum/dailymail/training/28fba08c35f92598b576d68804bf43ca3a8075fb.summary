just call him @entity1 , the one - eyed miracle dog			2
the 8 - year - old @entity4 mix has been credited with giving his dying owner the will to live after the two were reunited at a @entity10 hospital			1
@entity1 's owner , @entity11 , 73 , from @entity12 , @entity10 , has been at @entity13 since mid-september			1
one of the social workers at the hospital recently visited the patient and learned from him that @entity11 was pining for his beloved rescue @entity4 , @entity1			1
what neither @entity11 nor the hospital staff knew at the time was that @entity1 also quit eating			2
‘ we pulled out all the stops and found the dog , ’ @entity45 , chief nursing officer at @entity13 , told @entity46			0
after making some phone calls , nurses at @entity13 found out that @entity1 , who lost his right eye in a fight years earlier and who is missing his lower teeth , was taken to the @entity56 after his owner was hospitalized nearly six weeks later			2
employees at the rescue center reached out to a foster family that has been caring for @entity1 and scheduled to bring the pup to @entity13 in violation of the hospital ’s visitation policy , which did not allow pets			1
@entity67 : the 8 - year - old @entity4 mix lost his right eye in a fight , and his tongue is hanging out of his mouth because his bottom teeth are missing last saturday , little @entity1 was carried to @entity11 's hospital bed , and those who witnessed their reunion said there was not a dry eye in the room			1
‘ he was so sad at first			0
we had him wrapped in a baby blanket and he was shivering , ’ shelter president @entity81 told @entity82			0
‘ the minute we got about 20 steps from this guy ’s room ... his little head went up , ’ ‘ his eyes got real bright and he was like a different dog			0
’ the experience has left both the ailing dog owner and his four - legged pal completely transformed			0
as soon as he set his one good eye on mr @entity11 , a previously listless and distraught @entity1 came to life , and his owner began to cry tears of joy			2
in what nurses at @entity13 described as a ' complete turnaround , ' following @entity1 's second visit tuesday @entity11 sat up in bed for the first time in a long while , and started speaking and eating again			1
a video recorded by ms @entity81 during that repeat visit shows @entity11 lovingly petting @entity1 , and the pup snuggling up to him and licking his gaunt face			0
while mr @entity11 is not out of the woods yet in terms of his medical condition , hospital staff say he is no longer at death ’s door			0
special bond : @entity1 , who has been staying at an animal shelter and then with a foster family , stopped eating around the same time his owner did at the hospital ’ he does n’t even look like the same man , ’ nurse @entity45 said			1
‘ i did n’t expect the improvement to be this good			0
@entity11 is expected to meet with @entity1 on a regular basis as he continues his recovery , and the hospital is now planning to put in place a new pet visitation policy so that other patients could spend time with their four - legged friends			1
