raw : supermarkets are trying to stop food watchdogs publishing a ' name and shame ' list of stores selling campylobacter - contaminated chicken supermarkets have mounted a new attempt to stop food watchdogs publishing a ‘ name and shame ’ list of stores selling chicken contaminated with a deadly bug			1
the bug involved , campylobacter , is associated with 280,000 food poisoning cases a year and as many as 100 deaths , making it one of the biggest threats to public health			1
yet supermarkets and farmers have failed to eradicate the bug from farms and the meat reaching the high street and homes despite pleas from health experts dating back more than a decade			0
the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) has been conducting a survey of fresh chicken and has found evidence that 60 per cent is carrying campylobacter			1
the organisation is due to publish the details as early as this week and will identify which of the major retailers – @entity44 , @entity38 ’s , @entity39 , @entity40 , the co-op , @entity42 , and @entity43 – have the best and worst contamination levels			1
the supermarkets are worried about a customer backlash and have been putting enormous pressure on the @entity29 not to name the stores involved by questioning whether the survey will produce reliable results			2
the chief executive of the @entity29 , @entity52 , has revealed that she recently received a letter from the @entity54 ( @entity54 ) , which speaks for supermarkets , trying to kill plans to name the stores			2
the high pressure tactics are detailed in a paper written by @entity59 which will be discussed by the @entity29 board at a meeting in @entity62 tomorrow			2
she wrote : ‘ it is disappointing that the @entity54 , which speaks on behalf of retailers , has written to us again pressing us not to release the results of the retail survey and seeking to call into question the validity of the sampling plan , which they were consulted about before the survey commenced			0
’ the consumer group which ? has urged the @entity29 not to give in to the bullyboy tactics , saying consumers have a right to know whether they are at risk from handling and eating chicken			1
the consumer group ’s executive director , @entity80 , said : ‘ the @entity29 must not bow to industry pressure but should keep their commitment to putting consumers ' interests first by naming the worst performing shops for levels of campylobacter			1
‘ @entity89 is responsible for thousands of cases of food poisoning , and even deaths , each year so people have a right to know these results and which retailers are not performing well			1
’ chickens on sale at @entity44 : companies are working on methods that could reduce contamination levels the @entity54 said it was surprised at the @entity29 ’s reaction to its letter			2
a spokesman said : ‘ we were simply asking for confirmation that there was evidence behind the survey results which would give consumers clear information			0
’ he said : ‘ the @entity29 is an evidence based organisation , however , their findings at this stage are limited , based on a very small sample			0
’ the @entity54 said retailers are absolutely committed to reducing campylobacter rates			0
however , it said : ‘ despite the millions that have been invested there is , currently , no commercially available proven method			0
‘ research continues to look for one , but in the meantime the introduction of leak - proof packaging has been acknowledged by the @entity29 as being highly effective in preventing any issues when handling chicken when shopping			1
’ in fact , some companies are working on methods that could eradicate or reduce contamination levels			0
@entity132 , which is one of the @entity135 ’s biggest chicken producers , is trialling a system called @entity137 , which uses steam and ultrasound to kill bacteria			0
other options include washing the meat in a mild acid solution or flash freezing .			0
