the battered cardboard parcel arrived at the @entity9 's home last saturday from friends in @entity11 - after it went on a 12,000 mile round trip from the @entity14 country			1

@entity23 ( right ) , 14 , @entity24 ( left ) , 10 , and five - year - old @entity25 ( centre ) thought their @entity1 presents from friends in @entity11 had been lost in the post when the parcel arrived last saturday it had a stamp on it saying it had been ' missent to @entity5 ' - more than 6,000 miles away the box , which contained three books for @entity23 , 14 , @entity24 , 10 and @entity25 , five , is estimated to have cost @entity36 around £ 120 to send and arrived 50 days late			1
teenager @entity23 , who was delighted with his gift despite the delay , said : ' it must have stopped off in a lot of countries , because there 's no direct route to @entity5			0
' they do live up to their " worldwide delivery " slogan			0
' it was a bit of a shock when we got a very battered parcel from the depot			0
it was really nice to receive			0
@entity54 holds up the battered box , which arrived last week , after it cost @entity36 an estimated £ 120 to sent back the parcel travelled 6,142 miles ( 9884km ) back from @entity5 to @entity6 after the address was misread ' i think the sheer novelty of them having gone to @entity5 and back takes the sentimental value up			1
' the @entity11 - based friends who sent the parcel contacted the family in early january to see if the presents had been received and everyone assumed they had been lost in the post			0
