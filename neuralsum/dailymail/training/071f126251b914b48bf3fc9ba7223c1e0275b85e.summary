by @entity0 @entity1 has reiterated comments about @entity4 's health that drew ire from her husband @entity6 last week			1
the @entity8 strategist appeared on @entity9 with @entity10 on sunday speaking about the recent speculation that @entity4 may have suffered a traumatic brain injury after a fall at home in 2012 while she was suffering a stomach virus			1
' what i ’m questioning is whether or not it ’s a done deal that she ’s running , and she would not be human if she did not take this into consideration			2
' host @entity10 asked @entity1 flat out - does he , in fact , have doubts about @entity4 's health ? ' no , no , no , i do n't , ' he said , saying that the point of his recent remarks about @entity6 's health was to raise questions about whether the former secretary of state is guaranteed to run in 2016			1
@entity1 's fixation with @entity6 's health was kicked off last week when he said that ' we need to know what 's up ' with @entity6 's health and whether or not she suffered a traumatic brain injury in 2012			1
@entity6 ridiculed @entity1 's speculation at his wife 's fitness to run			1
' 100 per cent ' : representatives for the former secretary of state @entity4 ( seen may 16 ) say she is in vigorous health fit to run : @entity1 says @entity6 's health problems in 2012 may have been more serious than first thought , and that he is not questioning her health , but merely whether or not she 'll run in 2016 ' first , they said she faked her concussion and now they say she is auditioning for her part on @entity58 , ' @entity6 said at the @entity60 ’s @entity59			1
' i must be in really tough shape because she is still quicker than i am			0
' @entity1 said , ' i love being lectured by @entity6 that this is off - limits : " you ca n’t talk about her health			1
you ca n’t talk about her age			0
" let ’s remember this is a guy who ran for reelection by savaging @entity75			2
[ @entity76 ] looked like @entity77 in the @entity6 tv ads , ' indicating that , as host @entity10 hypothesized , @entity1 's speculation is merely a political play			1
despite his own stated confidence in @entity4 's health and fitness to run , @entity1 maintained that the @entity85 public needs answers			1
' let ’s be clear : she is going to have to cough up these medical records and describe this , if this was that serious , ' @entity1 said			1
@entity92 and @entity93 also appeared on the panel and @entity93 , who suffered his own health problems while vice president gave his take on the issue			2
' i think any presidential candidate or vice presidential candidate is going to have to answer questions about their health , ' he said			2
' i would n’t want to pre-judge mrs. @entity4 ’s health			1
i do n’t know about it			0
' a doctor believes the glasses @entity4 wore last year may have been the type used to treat double vision common to severe head trauma a prominent @entity113 ophthalmologist said in an interview yesterday that a special pair of glasses worn by @entity6 are the type used to treat the double vision sometimes caused by severe head trauma			2
in an interview with @entity9 , dr. @entity119 said the glasses had a @entity123 prism			2
' in order to see one object , your eyes need to be pointed in the same direction			0
if your eyes are misaligned , one way to optically align them is to put a prism ... on your glasses , ' he said			0
the comments fueled speculation by @entity1 about her time in the hospital in december 2012			2
she was reportedly fighting a stomach virus when she fell at home , hit her head , and suffered a concussion			0
a blood clot was later found behind her right ear			0
according to @entity119 , the severe head trauma may have caused double vision			0
' any issue which raises intracranial pressure can damage one of the nerves which moves the eye around , and if it damages one of the nerves , your eyes will be misaligned -- maybe temporarily , maybe more permanently , ' he said			0
rover has argued that @entity6 's health may be an issue if she runs for the presidency in 2016			1
' this was a serious deal			0
she basically was out of action , ' the former @entity163 administration adviser said tuesday			0
' she spends over a month fighting this			0
... and they 're not particularly forthcoming			0
' dr. @entity119 said he knew the glasses corrected double vision because they had a @entity123 prism @entity6 's reps have defended her , saying she 's at ' 100 per cent			1
' former president and husband @entity6 went so far as to say there was ' nothing ' to the health issue			1
dr. @entity119 said if he was given access to her medical records he would want to see imaging studies			2
' i would like to know what the results of any imaging studies were and the cause of why someone needed @entity187 , ' he said			0
' there are lots of different causes , anything from @entity193 to @entity194 to maybe a blood clot , these are all possible causes , but all we know is that she was using a @entity123 prism and therefore had double vision			0

@entity1 has again questioned @entity4 's health
