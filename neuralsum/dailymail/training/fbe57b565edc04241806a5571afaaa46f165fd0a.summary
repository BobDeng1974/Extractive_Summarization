by @entity0 published : 13:27 est , 6 september 2012 updated : 02:02 est , 7 september 2012 hopes of an early jail release for the @entity4 punk protesters dimmed last night after @entity6 president @entity5 launched a scathing attack on the three women singers			1
the trio are to appeal their two years prison sentences for staging a cathedral stunt opposing the strongman leader			1
supporters of the women - who have called for a revolution against @entity5 - fear his hardline stance will sway judges and rule out their punishments being reduced			1
members of the all - girl punk band @entity4 are to appeal their prison sentences ' first they went to the @entity23 and conducted an orgy there and then they went to the other cathedral and had another orgy , ' he said in a major tv interview			1
' the state is obliged to protect the feelings of the faithful			2
' the women were found guilty of ' hooliganism motivated by religious hatred ' for dancing and singing in @entity34			1
he also chided the police for taking no action when one of the three - @entity39 , 22 - was involved in a sexually explicit protest four years ago in a biological museum			2
president @entity5 criticised police for not taking action when @entity45 , a member of @entity4 , was involved in a protest four years ago ' they had a group sex session in a public place			1
they then uploaded it onto the @entity52			2
the authorities should have looked at this too , ' he stressed			2
recalled a @entity57 - era joke , he said : ' some fans say that group sex is better than one - on - one because - like in any collective work - you can take it easy a bit			0
' but he stressed : ' uploading it onto the @entity52 is controversial and can be subject to legal proceedings			0
' @entity5 asked his interviewer if he knew what the band 's name meant			1
' there is no need to pretend that you do n't know			0
it 's indecent , ' he said			1
he claimed the repression suffered by the church in @entity57 times meant it had to be respected now			0
but he denied behind the scenes pressure to send the women to jail , despite suspicions of this among the opposition and in the @entity83			2
' i know what is going on with @entity4 , but i am staying out of it completely ' , he said			0
supporters of @entity4 fear that @entity5 's hardline stance will sway judges @entity5 also denied he was clamping down on protest , declaring : ' what is " tightening the screws " ? if this means the demand that everyone , including representatives of the opposition , obey the law , then yes , this demand will be consistently implemented			1
' @entity5 also blasted @entity100 for ' double standards ' in the case of @entity104 founder @entity103 , alleging political interference in the attempt to extradite him to @entity107 for sexual offences			1
@entity103 is holed up in the @entity110 embassy and has been granted political asylum by the @entity113 country			0
' they decided to extradite him			0
what is this ? of course it is double standards , that is clear , ' he told @entity121 television			0
' as far as i know , @entity110 asked @entity107 for guarantees that @entity103 will not be extradited from @entity107 to the @entity124			0
it has received no such guarantees			0
' of course this leads one to think that this is a political case			0
