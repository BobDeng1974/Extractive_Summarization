by @entity0 for @entity2 , 21 , home is a large , rubbish - filled storm drain in the business district of @entity6 capital , @entity7			1
homeless since the age of 12 , his life has been one of hardship , moving from place to place , each squat becoming progressively dirtier , flimsier and more dangerous			1
but @entity2 's bad fortune has n't come about because he refuses to work or lacks education			1
instead , @entity2 , and others like him , are ostracised purely because he is gay			1
tough : @entity2 , just 21 , has been homeless and ostracised since the age of 12 because of his sexuality @entity6 is a country where 80 per cent of the population admit to being homophobic and having gay sex is punishable with 10 years of hard labour in prison			1
evangelical preachers who promote homophobia attract huge and receptive audiences , while lyrics in popular songs regularly include exhortations to ' kill the batty boys '			1
as a result , men like @entity2 , who says he has always felt like a man trapped in a woman 's body , are forced to the margins of society , with many cast out by their families			1
living with @entity2 in the drain is a group of 25 men , many of whom have to work as prostitutes to survive , and all of whom face a barrage of violent abuse on a daily basis			1
' this is a homophobic country , ' says @entity53 , another transgender man living in the drain			1
' you ca n't just go and sit in the park , 10 or 20 men , sit and hold hands and laugh			2
' if gay people are going to meet , you need a safe space to meet			2
' cast out : @entity53 ( left ) , @entity2 ( centre ) and @entity63 ( centre right ) with journalist @entity64 @entity65 : the men share this filthy storm drain with 22 others and are flooded with sewage and water when it rains precarious : @entity63 climbs down into the drain in her platform heels			1
she works as a prostitute for now , that safe space is the drain , although as @entity75 's @entity64 reveals in tonight 's episode of @entity77 , that safety is precarious			2
in one scene , a crowd streaming back past the drain from an athletics meet turns violent , peppering the gully with stones and screaming insults			2
asked what is happening , one replies : ' them [ the crowd ] are troubling them because they think them are gay , which is a man who goes with a man			2
' them boys will come out and they will burn them up			0
i want them to burn them up			0
' when the riot police arrive , they turn their attentions not on the crowd but to the men instead			0
' members of the diverse society , or if you want to call them , a group of homosexuals , throwing stones at people passing , pedestrians , ' one explains when asked what is going on			0
for @entity2 and his friends @entity63 and @entity53 , this is a risk they run every day			1
' it is very , very dangerous to do what i do , ' explains @entity63 , who works as a prostitute			1
' i 'm running a great , great risk			0
i know friends who passed on because of it , who died , got gunshots , were stabbed ... ' @entity63 was herself stabbed when she went to meet a client and found an angry gang of more than a dozen men waiting for her			1
' one of them was doing the damage , ' she remembers			0
' one of them had the knife , one of them doing the damage			0
they punctured a lung ... four times			2
' @entity2 too has suffered violent attacks and chose to leave home rather than allow his family , who live in a poverty - stricken part of the @entity6 capital , to be stigmatised by association with him			1
painful : @entity63 shows off one of the scars left after she was stabbed four times and almost died furious : local councillor @entity149 confronts the men			1
she wants them to be cleared out of the drain ' you have some @entity6 who will be moved [ by my plight ] but it would still leave like a stigma and bring down the family , ' he says			1
although still close to his sister , he has n't seen his parents for years and can not even walk the streets of the shanty where he grew up for fear of attack			2
' if i could [ walk through the streets ] , life would be 100 per cent better for me , ' he says			2
' i would n't have to go back into the gully			0
this is my yard , this is where i was born			0
this is where i had most of my fun growing up in life			0
' quite how precarious his life has become is made plain when you hear from local district councillor , @entity149 , who would like nothing more than to turf the group out of the storm drain			1
' @entity6 is homophobic , @entity6 is n't foreign , ' she froths			1
' so you ca n't come to @entity6 and dress up like a drag queen like you are foreign			1
' and guess what ! you can do it but if you do do it , you are going to be at a disadvantage			0
standing here , living underneath the gully is a reflection of that			0
' dangerous : @entity2 , pictured with reporter @entity64 , says he hopes an angel will take him away one day ' behind us is a residential community , ' she adds			2
' i get reports of petty theft , persons entering illegally into their back yards , whether to make out with people , or to use it as their bathroom			0
' that is why the commander of the @entity7 police will try to remove them from this gully			0
i do n't know where they will go after this			0
that is not my responsibility			0
' although @entity63 insists that a dangerous life on the margins of society is a price worth paying to be herself , it 's clear that the strain is beginning to tell on @entity2			1
' i think when i ca n't bear it anymore , the @entity222 will send some angel for me who will let me feel relief , ' he says , as tears slide down his cheeks			0
' right now i 'm going through a very hard time			0
i see where i come from and i see my family and i miss them a lot			0
' this life i 'm living is not for me but i have to cope with it and bear it			0
' see the full report on @entity77 : @entity6 's @entity237 , tonight at 7.30pm on @entity75			2
