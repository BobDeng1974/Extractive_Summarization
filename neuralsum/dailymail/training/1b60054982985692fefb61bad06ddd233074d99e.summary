by @entity0 electric lights , including those which illuminate laptop computers , smartphones and tablets , often play a key role in causing people to sleep badly , a leading expert has warned			1
artificial lights disrupt the body 's natural rhythm , affect chemicals in the brain and drive people to use stimulants like caffeine to stay awake longer , according to @entity18 academic professor @entity17			1
writing today in the journal nature , the professor of sleep medicine at @entity21 called for research to help develop ' behavioural and technical ' ways of counteracting the ill effects of artificial light on modern sleeping patterns			1
screen breaks : illuminated screens have been found to affect the body 's circadian clock - the genetic mechanism which helps regulate sleep - ' more powerfully than any drug ' the decline in the number of hours slept per night is affecting public health , including a greater risk of obesity , diabetes , heart disease , depression and stroke in adults and concentration problems in children , he said			1
while all electric light affected circadian rhythms - the natural body clock - and sleep , night - time exposure to led lights like those in phones and computers was ' typically more disruptive ' than standard electric light bulbs , he said			2
' there are many reasons why people get insufficient sleep in our 24/7 society , from early starts at work or school , or long commutes , to caffeine - rich food and drink , ' he wrote			1
' but the precipitating factor is an often unappreciated , technological breakthrough : the electric light			2
' without it , few people would use caffeine to stay awake at night			0
and light affects our circadian rhythms more powerfully than any drug			0
' poor sleep has been linked with health problems including obesity , heart disease and depression between 1950 and 2000 , the average person in the @entity87 increased their use of artificial light sources by four times , with a parallel rise in sleep deficiency , prof @entity17 said			1
artificial light inhibits sleep - promoting neurons in the brain and the nightly release of the hormone melatonin , which aids sleep , while activating neurons that boost alertness , he said			1
it fools the brain into delaying its ' second wind ' , which kicked in during the afternoon to see people through to sunset before electric light was invented , until much later in the day			0
he said that as a result of modern technology ' many people are still checking email , doing homework or watching tv at midnight , with hardly a clue that it is the middle of the solar night '			0
in a study , 30 per cent of all working adults in the @entity117 and 44 per cent of night workers reported getting less than six hours sleep a night on average			0
fifty years ago less than 3 per cent of the @entity117 adult population slept so little			0
and around the world , children are sleeping 1.2 hours less on school nights than a century ago , he said			0
' technology has effectively decoupled us from the natural 24 - hour day to which our bodies evolved , driving us to go to bed later , ' he said			0
' and we use caffeine in the morning to rise as early as we ever did , putting the squeeze on sleep			2

laptop and smartphone screens disrupt sleep and make us drink caffeine
@entity87 uses 4 times more artificial light today compared to the 1950s
poor sleep associated with obesity , diabetes , heart disease and depression
