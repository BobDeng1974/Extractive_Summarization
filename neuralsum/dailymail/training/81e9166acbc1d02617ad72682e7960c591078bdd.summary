by @entity0 schoolgirls should be able to dry their hair after @entity5 lessons and wear tracksuits instead of traditional short skirts to encourage them to take more exercise , a sports chief declared yesterday			1
young @entity10 women are among the least active in @entity11 with only six per cent taking the recommended level of exercise , warned @entity14 , chief executive of @entity15			1
schools should consider making radical changes such as installing cubicles and hairdryers in changing rooms and allowing up to 15 minutes extra time for girls to ‘ reconstruct ’ themselves after @entity5			1
they should also consider scrapping short gym skirts and allowing girls to wear clothes they feel comfortable in			1
they should also get 15 minutes extra to ' reconstruct themselves ' she added addressing heads of girls ’ schools , mrs @entity14 said research for @entity15 , the government ’s grassroots funding agency , suggested that girls felt self - conscious and unfeminine in school pe lessons			1
many also wanted dance or keep fit classes such as @entity46 instead of traditional team sports			0
schools should introduce as wide a range of sports as possible – including niche sports such as fencing and rowing - to draw girls in , she said			2
mrs @entity14 told the annual conference of the @entity64 ’ @entity56 ( @entity57 ) that @entity10 women aged 15 to 24 were 19th out of 28 nations for the amount of exercise they did , according to @entity62 figures			1
just six per cent exercised or played sport at least five times a week – the official recommended level to bring a range of health benefits			0
in contrast , @entity10 men were third in @entity11 , with 34 per cent physically active five times a week			0
among women , participation in @entity10 was behind countries often regarded as more ‘ traditional ’ such as @entity76 and @entity77 , as well as those such as @entity80 where equality was strongly promoted			0
‘ there is a significant issue in terms of girls ’ participation , ’ said mrs @entity14			2
barriers to taking part included girls being ‘ really preoccupied about how they look ’ , particularly in a social media age			0
@entity14 said barriers to girls taking part in sports included them being ' really preoccupied about how they look ' , particularly in a social media age girls ‘ @entity98 and @entity99 constantly ’ , giving a feeling of ‘ being on show ’			2
but mrs @entity14 , the first female chief executive of @entity15 , said it was important for girls to be able to ‘ reconstruct ’ themselves after taking part in physical activities at school			1
she said she had visited a mixed comprehensive in @entity107 where girls played the same amount of sport as boys – which was ‘ almost unheard of ’ in schools			0
it had put in hairdryers and plugs for hair tongs or other gadgets for girls to use after @entity5			1
‘ one of the ways they ’ve done it is in the girls ’ cloakroom , they asked them what they wanted and they said cubicles , hairdryers and plugs and 15 minutes after the session please so we can comb our hair and get ourselves looking how we looked when we went in , ’ said mrs @entity14			1
they wanted to ‘ emerge from it how we feel comfortable ’			2
’ it is so easy to pooh - pooh that , but they found that was one of the things that gave them parity , and really drew girls in			0
’ she added : ‘ the ability for a girl in particular - and particularly if she ’s 14 , 15 , 16 - to reconstruct herself after that flinging herself on the floor moment , thinking “ thank god that ’s over ” or “ i had a great time ” , is incredibly important			0
’ mrs @entity14 added that short skirts could be replaced by jogging bottoms			2
‘ i do n’t know anybody who really loves the short skirt but allowing them to wear things that they are comfortable in , talking to them about what they are comfortable in , is very , very important , ’ she said			0
@entity164 , chief executive of @entity57 , which runs 24 private girls ’ schools and two state academies , told the conference that a revival of ‘ warrior women ’ in popular culture was helping to inspire a new generation to become physically active			1
these included @entity176 , @entity177 and more recently @entity178 in the @entity179 or @entity175 in the @entity174			0
‘ it is heartening to see fictional heroines who can hold their own in a fight , who endure physical hardship and are n’t just waiting to be rescued by a hero on a white charger			0

installing hairdryers in changing rooms would encourage girls to exercise
schools should also scrap short gym skirts so they feel comfortable
should be given an extra 15 minutes to get ready after @entity5
