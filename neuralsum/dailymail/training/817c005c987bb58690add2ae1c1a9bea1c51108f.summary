@entity0 have secured the signature of the hottest teenager in world football by beating @entity5 's giants to @entity7 's @entity6			1
the attacking midfielder is still only 16 - years - old but has commanded wages of £ 80,000 - per - week after becoming @entity10 's youngest ever international in august last year aged 15			2
but what were the planet 's biggest stars doing when they were 16 , where were they playing and were they as talked - about as @entity6 ? @entity15 takes a look ... @entity7 teenager @entity6 has completed a move to @entity0 for a fee of £ 2.3million the @entity19 was unveiled to the world at @entity0 's @entity22 training ground on thursday @entity6 became the youngest player to represent his national team when he played for @entity10 aged 15 @entity25 , 27 , @entity26 where he was at 16 : @entity26 @entity25 was breaking into @entity26 's first team and at 16 made his uncompetitive debut in a friendly against @entity31 in @entity32			1
he came on in the 75th minute with the no 14 shirt on his back , brown hair flopping all over the place and long sleeves pulled over his knuckles			0
in that 15 minutes he almost scored twice and was making the same penetrating dribbles – although getting tackled a few more times than nowadays – and darting runs into the box			0
he would not make his debut in a competitive match until he was 17			2
@entity25 ( left ) makes his competitive debut for @entity26 against @entity46 aged 17 @entity26 superstar @entity25 has gone on to become arguably the world 's greatest ever player @entity49 , 29 , @entity0 where he was at 16 : @entity51 the thin , gangly @entity49 was already training with @entity51 's first team at 16 and on the verge of making his senior debut			1
@entity49 's mother was flown in from @entity56 to help ease through the homesick teenager with obvious exceptional talent			1
he became the first player in @entity51 's history to play for their @entity62 16 , under 17 , under 18 , b team and first team in one season although his senior league debut , where he scored twice , did not come until he had turned 17			1
@entity49 breezes past a defender after making his @entity51 first team bow at 17 @entity49 's ( centre ) incredible goal scoring feats in 2014 earned him a third @entity74 award @entity75 , 28 , @entity76 where he was at 16 : @entity78 typically for a goalkeeper of such tender years , @entity75 was nowhere near making his first - team debut at that age			1
but he was in the process of working his way through every single age group of his home - town club , which he had joined at an astounding five - years - old			0
he would have to wait until he turned 20 to make a breakthrough into the senior side and has not looked back since			0
@entity75 worked through every age group of his hometwon club before making his debut at 20 @entity76 and @entity91 's ' sweeper - keeper ' @entity75 is now recognised as the world 's best goalie @entity94 , 25 , @entity0 where he was at 16 : @entity96 the 16 - year - old @entity94 made his debut for @entity96 in the championship , playing at left - back but scoring regularly from free kicks and attracting the attention of several top flight teams			1
that season he won the @entity104 award and went on to become the @entity105 , before moving to @entity106 in the summer			2
@entity94 started his career at @entity96 as a left - back before being transformed into a forward @entity94 then became the world 's most expensive player when he moved from @entity106 to @entity0 for £ 86million @entity112 , 33 , @entity113 where he was at 16 : @entity115 @entity112 signed for @entity117 club @entity116 as a 15 - year - old but was already being paraded around @entity5 a year later			1
he was the same incredibly cocky character he is today , famously telling @entity120 he did not do trials when taken to visit the @entity123 manager			2
@entity120 has said : ' he was 16			0
i asked him to have a little training session with the first team and he did n't want to do it			0
do i regret it ? no. i will continue to do that unless our scouts have seen the player and says , " look he is absolutely 100 per cent "			0
' he did not , however , break into @entity115 's senior team until he was 18 and moved to @entity136 a year later			0
@entity112 refused the offer of a trial at @entity123 as a cocky 15 - year - old @entity112 has n't lost his attitude but has won league titles with six different clubs in four different countries @entity144 , 27 , @entity26 where he was at 16 : @entity146 what was the precociously talented @entity144 doing in his sweet 16th year ? he head - butted a referee after being shown a red card and was told he would ruin his career if continued drinking and partying			1
he was at @entity152 side @entity146 , where he would have to wait until he was 18 to break into the senior team			0
@entity144 was warned he would ruin his career with drinking and partying as a 16 - year - old former @entity155 striker @entity144 has grown up but not necessarily grown out of his early antics @entity157 , 31 , @entity76 where he was at 16 : @entity76 the full - back , now often playing as a defensive midfielder , was captaining @entity76 's youngsters to the youth @entity163 title , the second time he won it			2
even at 16 , there was never any doubt amongst those at @entity76 that he would break through			0
former youth coach @entity170 said at the time : ' if @entity157 will not make it in the @entity163 , nobody will anymore			0
' he captained their b team at 17 and made his first - team debut two years later			1
@entity157 has always been a @entity76 captain in the making after starring for their youth sides @entity157 's steady progression through the youth ranks led him to winning the @entity183 @entity184 , 29 , @entity185 where he was at 16 : @entity187 the @entity189 striker was smashing his way into @entity187 's senior team when he was 16			1

by october that season he had netted his first goals , scoring twice in a win away to @entity199 in the @entity200			0
but he properly introduced himself to world football when , five days before his 17th birthday , he became the youngest player to score in the @entity204 with an edge - of - the - box curler sent in off the crossbar in the last minute to end @entity123 's 30 - match unbeaten run			1
a 17 - year - old @entity184 announced himself to the world with a wonder goal for @entity187 against @entity123 @entity184 has since gone from tempestuous firebrand to captain of @entity189 and @entity185 @entity213 , 24 , @entity214 where he was at 16 : @entity216 @entity213 had moved from @entity217 to @entity218 as a 14 - year - old to develop as a player and was called up to @entity216 's reserve team at 16 , which was competing in the fourth tier of @entity218 football , while still featuring regularly for their @entity225			1
within six months he had impressed so much he was called into the senior side for a friendly and made his league debut against @entity228 from the bench that november			2
it would take a while before he established himself as a first - team regular			0

he visited @entity0 and @entity263 and had the likes of @entity185 drooling over him			2
he was already commanding @entity259 youth matches with step - overs and skills , but opted to stay in @entity261 – debuting for @entity259 at 17 and scoring 14 times in his first season – until he was 21			0
