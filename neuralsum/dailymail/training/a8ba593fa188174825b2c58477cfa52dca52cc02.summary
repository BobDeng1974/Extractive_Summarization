the method used to decide whether or not the @entity1 will fund a drug is should be scrapped , according to a new study			0
the formula used by the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) assesses a drug by looking at how much a year 's worth of treatment costs compared with the benefits the patient gains in life expectancy and improved health			1
but researchers , funded by the @entity14 , found the system currently used by the @entity17 drugs watchdog is deeply ' flawed '			2
flawed ? decisions not to fund drugs such as @entity20 for early breast cancer were reversed after causing huge controversy the method is known as quality - adjusted life years ( @entity25 ) and has been used as a template by other countries such as @entity28			1
however , the decisions are often controversial as they affect whether patients suffering illnesses such as cancer can receive potentially life - altering treatments			1
@entity5 generally turns down treatments that cost more than £ 20,000 per @entity25 as not cost - effective , which often rules out new revolutionary drugs			1
now a team of researchers , led by @entity40 doctor @entity39 , have called for it to be scrapped as it produces the ' wrong results			0
' ' this is n't a scientific way to classify and prioritise the drugs - mathematically , it 's flawed , ' dr @entity39 told the @entity46			2
' @entity5 has made negative recommendations about many major innovative drugs , based only on arbitrary incremental cost per @entity25			1
' the researchers added that the method does n't reflect different views on illness and disability			0
dr @entity39 believes the system used by @entity5 to decide whether to fund drugs produces the ' wrong results ' they found these could vary widely after surveying 1,300 @entity61 respondents , including 301 in the @entity17			1
for instance while 71 per cent of respondents would prefer to live 15 years in a wheelchair than die after ten or five years in a wheelchair , the remaining 29 per cent would rather die earlier			0
the team suggested that another approach should be considered , perhaps that looked at how many relapses a drug might prevent or how many cases of remission it could provide			0
the findings were welcomed by a number of charities			0
@entity76 , chairman of the @entity77 said : ' this new research funded by the @entity14 underlines what we have been saying about the @entity5 system of cost of ‘ treatment against effect on health and life expectancy ’ all along , it is simply incorrect			1
@entity5 have to scrap these guidelines now and start giving hope to all cancer patients and put a stop to their ‘ flawed ’ methodology without fail			1
' however , a number of @entity17 experts have defended the system , saying difficult decisions needed to be made working with a limited budget			1
prof @entity98 , @entity99 of @entity100 , @entity101 , said : ' these type of criticisms are not new and do not invalidate what is done by @entity5			2
' of course the @entity25 approach is not perfect , but some mechanism is needed to provide consistent comparisons across different medical interventions , based on aggregate benefit and cost			2
otherwise the money could go to those with the most appealing emotional argument			0
' prof @entity114 , from the @entity115 and a member of the @entity117 for 10 years , said : ' we need to be able to compare what we gain by spending in one area with what we lose by not spending in another area			0
' this new project ’s suggested approach of using measures of outcome specific to particular diseases will not allow us to do that			0
' qalys are certainly not perfect and we should be looking for better ways of informing decision making but getting rid of an imperfect system without replacing it with a better one is not the way forward			0
' a @entity5 spokesperson said : ' when we want to find out whether a new treatment provides more for patients than current practice , and whether any improvement in quality or length of life justifies the price the @entity1 is asked to pay for it , we need to use a measure that can be applied fairly across all diseases and conditions			1
the qaly is the best measure anyone has yet devised to enable us to do this			0
' economists will argue about the precision of the qaly methods and it ’s not perfect			0
but it ’s based on solid research and uses a way of measuring how quality of life changes when using different treatments , which is the best we have available			2
' it ’s developing and improving all the time and the criticisms in this , rather limited study have n’t shaken our confidence in its value to @entity5 in helping make decisions on the best way to use new and sometimes very expensive drugs and other health technologies			1

drugs rationing body @entity5 weighs cost of treatment against effect on health and life expectancy
decisions can be controversial as more expensive *pioneering* drugs are often turned down
some doctors have defended *fomula* saying it helps to make difficult decisions working with a limited budget
