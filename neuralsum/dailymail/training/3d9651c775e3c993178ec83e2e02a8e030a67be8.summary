by @entity0 for the @entity1 it was n't quite the 44 damned days of @entity5 's @entity4 reign 40 years ago , but @entity7 's spell at @entity8 did not last a great deal longer			1
just 70 days into @entity11 's experiment with an unknown manager plucked from @entity13 , he was given the @entity15 thumbs down			1
the unforgiving @entity17 owner , who famously got through 36 managers in 22 years at @entity19 , pulled the trigger after wednesday 's derby defeat by @entity22			1
he said : ' i 'm not a quitter , i 'm a fighter			2
i feel as though not just myself , but the team at the moment , things just are n't going our way			0
' i do n't have to say this but the players are 100 per cent behind the way we want to play			0
the president , everyone , they all want us to do well			0
we 're getting a lot of bad press at the moment , some of it self inflicted , and we 're making it very difficult for ourselves on the field at the moment			0
' humbled : @entity4 lost 2 - 1 to @entity58 rivals @entity22 on wednesday night but @entity11 deals solely in cold , hard facts and @entity7 has presided over three league defeats from four matches , leaving @entity4 just above the @entity63 drop zone			1
the writing had been on the wall since @entity4 suffered a 4 - 1 thrashing at @entity67 on august 23			2

over and out : @entity4 owner @entity11 felt he had to act after disappointing start to the season infamous : @entity76 was sacked after just 44 days in charge at @entity4 in the seventies @entity11 had decided to axe @entity79 after the @entity67 defeat but dramatically changed his mind the following day , blaming ' one s * * * mistake from @entity83			1
' but it proved to be a brief stay of execution as the 56 - year - old was sacked on thursday			0
he said : ' i 'd like to thank @entity7 for his efforts over the last two and a half months			1
' but the results since the start of the season have meant we needed to act and make this decision			0
slump : @entity4 are just above to the drop zone after losing three of their four league games ' after the defeat at @entity22 i realised that my decision to keep @entity7 at the club following the defeat at @entity67 was wrong , and i had to change my mind on the coach 's position			1
as a club we will now begin our search for a new head coach			0
' former @entity110 defender @entity109 and former @entity4 captain and manager @entity111 are among the frontrunners to fill the hot seat and despite @entity11 's reputation , there will be no shortage of candidates			1
@entity7 's assistant , @entity119 , has also lost his job and @entity121 will lead the team against @entity123 on saturday			2
