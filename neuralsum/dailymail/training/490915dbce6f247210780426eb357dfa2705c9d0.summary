by @entity0 children are five times more likely to become obese if their older brother or sister is overweight , a new study has found			1
an only child is 2.2 times more likely to put on excess weight if one of their parents is obese , according to a survey			1
but while parental influence is well documented , a child with an obese older sibling is much more likely to become overweight , with the risk shooting up 5.6 times			1
it comes as a second piece of research suggests eating out with healthy friends can help a person shed the pounds , as people are influenced by their peers ' food choices			1
children are five times more likely to become obese if they have overweight older siblings ( file picture ) a survey , which assessed more than 10,200 households in the @entity30 , found childhood obesity varied according to the number of children as well as their gender			1
meanwhile , older children in a two - child household with an obese parent are 2.3 times more likely to be obese - but that number jumps to 5.4 times for those with overweight younger siblings			1

their findings were published in the october issue of the @entity49			0
lead investigator @entity50 said : ‘ we found that obesity status of a younger child 's older sibling is more strongly associated with a child 's obesity than is the parent 's obesity status			0
’ the report found that only children were less likely to exercise and more likely to eat fast food than those with brothers and sisters ‘ this association is independent of a host of socioeconomic and demographic attributes , health behaviours , and overall health status			2
’ he added that the findings were ‘ consistent with research showing that siblings tend to eat alike and have similar levels of physical activity ’			2
the survey also revealed a link between gender and the risk of obesity with younger children more susceptible to the influence of an older brother or sister if that sibling is of the same sex			2
only children were also found to be less likely to exercise and more likely to eat fast food than those with brothers and sisters			2
but data also showed that having a very active older sibling upped the obesity risk for the younger brother or sister			0
mr @entity50 added : ' younger children look up to their big brother or sister for behavioral cues , often seeking their approval ; and siblings may spend more time each other than with their parents , often eating and playing sports together			1

while many of those who dined together appeared to choose different dishes , they tended to choose from the same categories			0
the research was carried out by experts at the @entity139 at @entity139 ’s @entity140			0
it found that the popularity of salads and vegetarian dishes shot up when more than one person in the group ordered healthier dishes			0

she added : ‘ people are happier spending money and eating more calories as long as their peers are			2

more than 10,000 homes across the @entity30 were assessed as part of the study
