the universe as we know it may not be the only one in existence			2
in fact , it could be one of a number of parallel universes making up a ‘ multiverse			1
’ in this scenario , there could be multiple versions of you in different universes – ones doing exactly the same thing , and others where your ' twin ' has made completely different life choices			2
it may be stretching the imagination , but theory has gained traction following the major discovery of gravitational waves on monday			1
that theory is linked to the idea that the universe is constantly giving birth to different , parallel universes earlier this week , astronomers detected what happened in the first billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second after the @entity42			1
this very brief moment of time at the beginning of everything is when the universe expanded very rapidly - a theory called cosmic inflation			1
according to @entity53 when something very explosive like this happens it leaves ripples in space - time known as ' gravitational waves '			1
gravitational waves from cosmic inflation generate a faint but distinctive twisting pattern in the universe			1
shown here is the pattern observed with the @entity63 telescope , providing evidence for cosmic inflation after the @entity42 , although the results have been called into question @entity68 this graphic shows the universe as it evolved from the @entity42 to now			1
@entity72 scientists believe that the universe expanded from subatomic scales to the astronomical in just a fraction of a second after its birth astronomers announced on monday that they ripples in the fabric of space - time that are echoes of the massive expansion of the universe after the @entity42			1
predicted by @entity53 nearly a century ago , the discovery of the ripples , called gravitational waves , would be a crowning achievement the understanding of how the universe began and evolved			1
the ‘ multiverse ’ theory is based on the fact that these gravitational wave point to a particularly powerful type of inflation of the early universe			1
in some regions of physical reality inflation , continues and in others it stops			2
in the regions where it has stopped someone looking back on this time would see a ' bang ' - the birth of their universe			1
the ‘ multiverse ’ theory is based on the fact that these primordial gravitational wave point to a particularly powerful type of inflation of the early universe			1
‘ in most models , if you have inflation , then you have a multiverse , ’ said @entity115 physicist @entity114 speaking at a conference on monday			2
theorists argue that every kind of universe is out there in the aftermath of the @entity42 , from our familiar universe to universes that have completely different physical properties			1
' when it comes to inflation , universes beyond our own come wrapped up as part of the package – what we see as our universe is what remained after inflation ceased in this part of reality , ' @entity131 , author of ' @entity132 in @entity133 ' , told @entity143			2
' what 's just been found is “ a smoking gun ” for inflation – the most concrete evidence we have to date that it actually happened			1
so the multiverse is looking more likely than ever			0
' scientists , from left , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity157 - @entity156 and @entity159 smile during a news conference at the @entity161 in @entity162 to announce their groundbreaking results on gravitational waves the term ‘ multiverse ’ was invented in december 1960 , by @entity167 , then vice chairman of the @entity168			1
it is based on the theory of eternal inflation , which suggests that shortly after the @entity42 that formed the universe , space - time expanded at different rates in different places			1
according to eternal inflation theory , this gave rise to bubble universes that may function with their own separate laws of physics			2
the idea of other universes out there may seem strange , but scientists say it can help solve some problems of fundamental physics			2
for instance , the long - standing mystery of why nature appears to be fine - tuned for the emergence of life can be explained by the picture of a multiverse			0
some scientists argue that intelligent observers exist only in those rare areas in which the conditions happen to be just right for life to evolve			0
the rest of the multiverse remains barren , but no one is there to notice it			0
another multiverse theory suggests that if space - time goes on forever , it must start repeating at some point , because there are a finite number of ways particles can be arranged			1
the multiverse theory could explain a number of processes that have stumped cosmologists for years			0
for example , there is the 1998 discovery that galaxies in our universe seem to be spreading apart at an accelerating rate			2
this goes against the rule that mutual gravitational attraction should be slowing them down			0
if there were multiverses , our universe may happen to be one in which the dark energy is relatively weak			0
it could also resolve the dilemma in ‘ superstring ’ theory			0
at its most basic level , describes all subatomic particles as vibrating filaments and membranes of energy			0
the string theory only works in ten or eleven dimensions			0
' such a multiverse might even explain the very reason we exist at all , ' said mr @entity131			0
' the natural forces at work in our universe , like gravity , for example , seem strangely fined tuned for life			0
cosmologists studying a map of the universe from data gathered by the @entity257 spacecraft concluded that it shows anomalies that can only have been caused by the gravitational pull of other universes ' @entity262 with the settings of nature even slightly and that creates a universe devoid of stars , planets and people			2
how come all the settings are perfectly suited for living things ? ' it seems an extremely unlikely coincidence			0
however , if there really are a multitude of other universes out there , each with their own settings , at least one of them will have the right settings for life			0
' our existence moves from being highly improbable to inevitable			0
in fact , if the number of other universes is infinite , there are an infinite number of copies of @entity290 out there , with an infinite number of copies of you , reading an infinite number of identical versions of this article			0
' last year , scientists were able to create a map of light from when the universe was just 380,000 years old last year , scientists said that they had found the first ' hard evidence ' that other universes exist			1
cosmologists studying a map of the universe from data gathered by the @entity257 spacecraft concluded that it shows anomalies that can only have been caused by the gravitational pull of other universes			2
the map shows radiation from the @entity42 13.8billion years ago that is still detectable in the universe - known as cosmic microwave radiation			1
scientists had predicted that it should be evenly distributed , but the map shows a stronger concentration in the south half of the sky and a ' cold spot ' that can not be explained by current understanding of physics			0
@entity326 , theoretical physicist at the @entity327 , said : ‘ these anomalies were caused by other universes pulling on our universe as it formed during the @entity42			1
’ a multiverse could resolve the dilemma in ' superstring ' theory			0
at its most basic level , the theory describes all subatomic particles as vibrating filaments and membranes of energy			0
but string theory only works in ten or eleven dimensions and we only experience four			0

on monday , scientists discovered ' smoking gun ' to expanding universe
they found gravitational waves produced moments after the @entity42
the discovery points to powerful type of inflation of the early universe
if space - time goes on forever then it must start repeating at some point
this suggests the cosmos is constantly giving birth to parallel universes
