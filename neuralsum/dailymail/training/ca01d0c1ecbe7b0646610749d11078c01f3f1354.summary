@entity0 has almost certainly played his last test for @entity2 , with the rockiest marriage of convenience in sport now considered beyond repair			1
in the wake of their 5 - 0 @entity11 defeat , coach @entity7 and captain @entity8 are set to be backed by the incoming managing director of @entity2 , @entity13 , as they begin the task of regaining the urn in 2015			1
unless the positions of @entity19 , @entity8 and the team management change drastically , that will mean the end of the nine - year run of an extraordinary soap opera starring the @entity25 - born maverick , whose career has been touched by batting of sheer brilliance but who has polarised opinion like few others in the history of the game			0
over and out : @entity0 's career with @entity2 could be over with the batsman out of form and favour home soil : @entity0 was back in @entity2 on sunday watching @entity40 's game with @entity41 interest : @entity0 was keen to take photos at @entity43 , taking his mind off events in @entity46 irresponsible : @entity0 has been accused of batting without consideration for the team attempt at redemption : @entity8 and @entity7 will lead @entity2 's future plans and they do n't include @entity0 immediately after the end of the grim whitewash in @entity54 , @entity7 denied reports that he believed @entity0 ’s batting for the majority of the tour had been so irresponsible and his behaviour behind the scenes so divisive that he had issued @entity13 with an ultimatum stating either the 33 - year - old went or he would			1
may 2005 : overlooked for @entity63 against @entity64 , but named in @entity2 ’s 25 - man development squad and one - day squad			0
july 2005 : scores 57 and 64 on test debut but @entity46 crush @entity2 by 239 runs			2
march 2006 : fined 30 per cent of his match fee for dissent after his dismissal in the first test against @entity76			0
jan 2007 : @entity2 ’s top scorer in @entity46 - but the @entity11 are lost 5 - 0			0
may 2007 : posts his then highest score of 226 in the second test against the @entity81 at @entity82			0
aug 2008 : replaces @entity83 as @entity85 captain and scores century in debut innings as skipper against @entity89			0
jan 2009 : reports of a rift between @entity0 and coach @entity93 surface and @entity94 resigns after just three tests in charge			2
july 2009 : with @entity2 leading the @entity11 1 - 0 after two tests , @entity0 is ruled out of the rest of the series because of an @entity101 injury			1
dec 2010 : new career - best 227 in @entity103 during @entity2 ’s triumphant @entity11 campaign			0
july 2011 : @entity105 runs with third test double hundred against @entity76 at @entity107			0
aug 2012 : allegations made that he sent derogatory text messages about @entity111 and @entity7 to the @entity25 dressing room			0
in truth , no such threat was necessary			0
for the powers that be had already determined that they should support @entity7 and the methods he has employed while helping them reach no 1 in the world and achieve three @entity11 series wins on the trot , based largely on a team ethic that @entity0 has never felt able to buy into with genuine commitment			2
@entity8 , himself under increasing pressure following @entity2 ’s dismal start to the one - day series against @entity46 amid his own poor batting form , is also understood to be fully supportive of @entity19 ’s reported position			1
the captain was chiefly responsible for re-integrating @entity0 after the summer test series against @entity89 in 2012 ended with @entity2 ’s @entity25 - born batsman being dropped after the emergence of texts he had sent to ‘ close friends ’ in the opposing dressing room , thought to be critical of then captain @entity111 as well as @entity7			1
while the @entity141 coach was less enthusiastic , he felt it necessary to back @entity8 as he took over after @entity111 quit at the end of the affair			0
the uneasy peace between the pair survived on the back of @entity2 ’s series win in @entity76 , in which @entity0 ’s masterful century in the second test in @entity150 was crucial , and their 3 - 0 @entity11 victory last summer			1
but it has finally ended in the breakdown of a relationship characterised by barely disguised mutual distrust and a lack of personal respect , dating back to when @entity0 took over as @entity2 captain in 2008			2
emboldened by a perception that , by persuading his players to return to @entity76 following the terrorist atrocity in @entity150 he had earned a blank cheque to manage the team his way , @entity0 called for the sacking not only of coach @entity93 but his then assistant , @entity7			1
some were certain he wanted his long - term mentor and fellow @entity25 , @entity169 , installed instead			0
@entity0 quit and @entity93 was sacked , after which @entity0 was said to be considering his future and seemed reluctant to accept the new regime @entity7 forged with new captain @entity111			1
he spent much of the 2009 @entity85 series in @entity81 under a cloud of indifference and missed the last three tests of that summer ’s victory over @entity46 with injury			0
glory days : in august last year @entity0 and his teammates were celebrating their third ashes win in a row eye to eye : @entity2 captain cook and @entity0 ( left ) trudge off the @entity185 after their four - day loss in december not so bad : @entity0 had the second highest average of @entity2 's batsmen after the five @entity189 , but that 's a dubious honour considering it 's 29.4 which put him just ahead of @entity193 bowler @entity192 but , while @entity0 played his full part in @entity2 ’s rise under @entity111 and the historic ashes win in 2010 - 11 , more issues arose concerning his injured achilles tendon and recurring knee problems , including a feeling that they were badly managed by @entity2			1
@entity201 ( dec 2010 ) catches : 62 frustration that opportunities to play in the lucrative @entity203 have been curtailed by @entity2 ’s insistence on retaining their players for the early summer home test series has grown steadily and it boiled over in his brief retirement from one - day international cricket in 2012 , apparently accepted by @entity7 and @entity2 with something less than reluctance			1
at the same time it has become increasingly evident that @entity0 no longer has any time for the technical advice of @entity19 or batting coach @entity214			0
@entity0 ’s one - to - one net practice has comprised throw - downs supplied by former @entity218 leg - spinner @entity217			1
some insiders go so far as to suggest some of @entity0 ’s behaviour on the current tour - during which his supporters , @entity83 and @entity223 , were vocal in their criticism of @entity225 - may have been fuelled by his desire to be given a second chance at the captaincy			2
even before the @entity11 began , @entity223 , a firm friend and ally , argued in print that the @entity2 team could make progress only with @entity0 in charge			2
@entity83 has subsequently called for him to be appointed vice-captain			0
backers : @entity193 spin legend @entity223 , also a friend of the controversial batsman , is highly critical of @entity8 's captaincy , while former @entity2 captain @entity83 believes @entity0 should be vice-captain bunny : fired - up @entity193 quick @entity241 marked his 10th dismissal of @entity0 at the recent @entity85 in @entity244 inner sanctum : @entity0 's net sessions now amount to little more than throw downs from @entity217 @entity0 has been included in @entity2 ’s preliminary 30 - man squad for the upcoming @entity249 in @entity64 and they may feel he can offer them an option in the shorter form of the game for some time to come , or at least until the @entity253 in @entity46 and @entity254			1
but , with @entity7 insisting all players play for their county clubs at the start of the summer in order to show their willingness to fight to retain their places , many eyes will be on next month ’s @entity203 draft			1
if @entity0 , who has not been retained by @entity264 , makes himself available to other franchises for the full six weeks of the tournament rather than just the first three weeks , that would go against @entity7 ’s stipulation on playing for his county			1
some within the management are also mindful that the first series of the home summer is against @entity273 , now coached by @entity274 , with whom @entity0 remains in regular touch			0
both @entity7 and @entity214 have said that life in @entity2 ’s new era may get worse before it gets better , which some have taken as a clear indication of the pain they may have to suffer without @entity0 ’s runs in the short term			1
ramp it up : @entity0 shows his innovation for the @entity264 , the @entity203 side which has dropped all of it 's players protocol : flower wants @entity290 players to appear for their counties at the start of the summer - in @entity0 's case , @entity294 - however the batsman 's yet to decide if he 'll make himself for the new @entity203 season in the frame : @entity0 has been named in the squad for this year 's @entity299 in @entity64 he could be given the option to retire from @entity301 , with long - held and deep - seated concerns over how long his knee would allow him to play all formats of international and @entity203 cricket anyway			1
he has restated his desire to carry on playing for @entity2 at @entity85 level and to achieve his goal of scoring 10,000 @entity85 runs			2
but former skipper @entity309 , highly critical of what he described as @entity0 putting his ego before the needs of the team in @entity46 , spoke for many when he told @entity315 last week : ‘ a lot of @entity0 ’s public pronouncements have tended to have the air of something constructed to please those who are listening rather than necessarily all coming from the heart or all being true			0
‘ if these latest stories of @entity0 being divisive and disruptive in the dressing room are true , @entity2 face an agonising choice because potentially they will be losing a very fine player			2
’ for better or worse , richer or poorer , in sickness and in health , it seems the choice has already been made .			0

@entity0 has in all *likelihood* played his last tests for @entity2
the batsman is n't in @entity7 and @entity8 's future plans
the uneasy peace survived after @entity2 's historic win in @entity76
flowers demand that players appear for their county at is at odds with @entity0 's desire to pick up a lucrative @entity203 contract
@entity0 ignores coaching staff and just gets throw downs from @entity217
there are claims his attitude is because he wants another shot at captaincy
@entity2 may *cop* the loss of @entity0 's runs in the interests of a fresh start
