by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 22:21 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 09:48 est , 30 october 2013 authorities are trying to figure out how a small plane managed to crash at a major international airport and go undetected for as long as six hours			2
a single - engine @entity5 crashed early tuesday morning at @entity7 and burst into flames , killing the pilot			1
it went unnoticed until being seen just before 9am by the pilot of a large commercial jet taxiing by the wreckage			1
it was not discovered until 9am - well after sunrise , when a plane attempting to take off spotted the wreckage and reported it			1
socked in : the pilot attempted to land late at night in heavy fog and apparently crashed about 3am tuesday the wreckage of the plane can be seen here from the air			1
it appears that the aircraft burst into flames after crash - landing officials have remained tight - lipped about the accident			2
the pilot has not been identified , but the plane was registered to the @entity31 , in @entity32 , @entity33 , according to reports			1
the crash did not delay commercial flights into or out of the airport - jets used the other three runways			1
the @entity40 is still investigating how the crash went unnoticed for several hours , @entity39 reports			2
footage from the scene showed the burnt out hull of a plane sitting just to the right of one of the airport ’s main runways			2
radio transmissions aired on @entity51 , detailed the confusion on the ground shortly after the charred aircraft was first noticed			0
the tower had no idea what had happened			0
‘ just to verify , there is debris on the field just before you get to [ runway ] two center ? ’ the tower asked			0
‘ is it off the runway ? ’ ‘ @entity68 , ’ confirmed the pilot			1
a small private airplane : this @entity5 - 172 single - engine plane flew from @entity32 to @entity7 and tried to land in heavy fog dead : the pilot , still unidentified , was killed in the crash ‘ he says it ’s about 500 feet from the approach … it appears that something may have gone off the right side of the runway , ’ the tower continued			1
airport operations then scrambled to mount a response , temporarily closing the airport			0
in an even more bizarre twist , an air traffic controller told someone sent to investigate the scene not to radio the findings back to the tower , but to call on a private phone line			0
a call placed to @entity7 by @entity93 seeking further comment was not returned			2
the unidentified pilot , in his late 30s and licensed to fly since 1989 , according to @entity97 president @entity96 , did not survive the crash			0
‘ he was a member in good standing , his license was in good standing and he was qualified to fly at night , ’ mr @entity96 told @entity93			0
sprawling : @entity7 as seen from above the pilot had flown @entity31 planes before , had checked - in , rented the plane and done everything the right way , said mr @entity96			1
‘ there ’s nothing surrounding this occurrence that is out of the ordinary , ’ he added			0
outside of the crash , which the seasoned pilot said has never happened in the organization ’s 77 - year history			2
‘ we ’ve been training pilots and renting aircraft since 1944 and we ’ve never had an accident of this magnitude , ’ said mr @entity96			0
it is not known if the deceased pilot was married or had any family , his name is being withheld until next of kin , if they exist , can be notified , mr @entity96 added			0
the @entity40 has yet to comment on the accident , but it is believed weather may have played a part			0
heavy fog blanketed the @entity7 region , including the airport , overnight and into the morning .			1

the single - engine @entity5 crashed at @entity7 in fog at about 3am tuesday morning
it went unnoticed until almost 9am , when the pilot of a large , commercial jet saw the wreckage while taxiing down the runway
the plane is registered to a @entity142 , @entity32 , @entity33 - based flying club , the pilot has yet to be identified
