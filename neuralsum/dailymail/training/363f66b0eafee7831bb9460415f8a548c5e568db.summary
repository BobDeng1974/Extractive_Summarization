@entity0 may just be a very @entity2 kind of sporting hero			1
it ’s not that we expect our heroes to bash 85 from 83 balls on test debut , as @entity0 did in @entity9 on monday			1
it ’s that we seem to prefer it when they ’re humble — no matter how misplaced the humility			0
two months ago , after @entity0 had thrashed 121 off 74 balls in a one - day international against @entity15 at @entity16 , he suggested : ‘ i ’m probably not ready for @entity18 — that is my honest opinion , and it ’s the opinion of others			1
’ in fairness , his captain @entity21 had just ventured the same view			0
but the effect was profound			0
here was the most exciting talent in @entity2 cricket playing down his own prospects			0
take a bow : @entity0 hit 85 runs off 83 balls on his test debut against @entity33 double act : @entity36 batsmen @entity35 ( l ) and @entity0 leave the field at tea during day two if you can whack the ball regularly for six and do it self - deprecatingly , you are — in the eyes of the @entity2 sporting public — halfway there			1
the scene was perfectly set as @entity0 walked out to embark on a @entity18 career that already looks as if it will spell the end for @entity47			1
@entity36 were 420 for five and in search of a pick - me - up after losing three for 65 either side of lunch			1
ideally , they wanted 550 before declaring — as quickly as possible			0
having got his head round the fact that he was ‘ closer than perhaps i thought ’ to being ready for @entity18 , he had prepared for this match by pledging to stick to his natural game			0
this can also include a certain looseness outside off stump , however , and @entity0 was still yet to score when he prodded @entity60 low down to @entity62 at second slip			1
lucky ? @entity0 escaped several umpire decisions in @entity9 the chance probably carried , but tv umpire @entity66 discerned enough doubt			1
@entity0 celebrated his reprieve by bunting @entity69 over mid-off for four , then scything his next ball over the covers — a miscue , as it turned out , but a profitable one			2
after that , a generous @entity75 crowd lapped up all the fun of the fair			0
there were more missed opportunities as he chanced his arm : @entity81 dropped him at first slip on 23 , while @entity33 ’s skipper @entity83 bungled a decent stumping chance when he was on 59			2
but in between was an exhilarating taste of the years ahead			0
after taking 50 balls over his first 26 runs , he decided to bat as if he was masterminding a one - day run - chase for @entity90			2
@entity69 was reverse - swept for four with the kind of power most batsmen summon up for their conventional sweep , then launched back over his head for six			0
all good things come to and end : @entity0 is eventually bowled out by @entity69 soon after , debutant seamer @entity97 was deposited for 20 in five balls , including two leg - side heaves for six			1
by the time @entity0 chopped on against @entity69 , he had thrashed 59 off his last 33 deliveries , and the spring in @entity33 ’s step had long gone			1
there are sure to be pitfalls along the way			0
he may need a bit of luck from time to time , and his wicketkeeping will get better			0
but , for a dressing room in need of a shot of adrenaline , this was just the ticket			0
@entity0 survived after edging @entity60 behind before he had scored a run			2
@entity62 caught the ball low at second slip and @entity33 celebrated but the umpires — unsure if the ball had hit the floor first — referred the decision to third umpire @entity66			1
after several replays , he decided there was enough doubt to give @entity0 not out ...			2

@entity0 hit 85 from 83 balls in test debut against @entity33
@entity0 *'s* rise for @entity36 could spell the end for @entity47
batsman was given not out after low catch by @entity62
