on saturday night they could be crowned the best team on the planet if they win the @entity3 against @entity4 , but next month @entity5 could establish themselves as one of the greatest sides ever by breaking the world record for consecutive wins			1
when they beat @entity14 4 - 0 in their last @entity12 group game they made it 19 successive wins and that gave them the best record of any @entity20 team ever , beating the 18 - match run of @entity24 's @entity23 side in the 2005 - 06 season			1
but now the challenge is to match the @entity28 team that won 26 straight games in the 1971 - 72 campaign			1
to manage that they will first have to beat @entity4 on saturday , @entity32 at the @entity33 in their first league game back after the winter break , and then @entity37 in the @entity38 in january at the @entity39			1
this will draw them level with @entity44 side @entity43 , who won 24 games on the bounce in 2011			2
@entity5 players celebrates scoring during the victory over @entity50 - their 21st win in succession @entity54 ( left ) and @entity55 train in @entity56 ahead of sunday 's @entity3 final @entity58 ( centre ) puts a whistle in his mouth as @entity55 ( right ) and his team - mates look on @entity54 does some leg stretches as team - mates @entity66 ( right ) and @entity67 look on the @entity68 forward sprints during a training session in @entity56 on thursday goals : 79 left - footed goals : 19 right - footed goals : 42 headed goals : 15 goals ( outside box ) : 9 goals ( inside box ) : 70 goals ( penalties ) : 8 conceded : 10 then , if they were to beat @entity81 and @entity82 , they would then draw level with @entity28 , and a win over @entity37 in the second leg of their @entity3 last - 16 match would give them the new world record			1
the incredible run has been made all the more impressive by the fact that it followed consecutive defeats to @entity91 and @entity37 earlier in the season			0
there were doubts over whether the new signings were fitting in , and whether the side could cope with the loss of @entity98 and @entity99			0
@entity58 's assistant @entity100 recalls : ' we had a difficult game against @entity91			0
we were really coasting in the first half and could have been 5 - 0 up and ended up losing 4 - 2			0
then we followed that up with a defeat by @entity37			0
it was a difficult time and we really had n't got up to speed quickly enough			0
real goalkeeper @entity107 and @entity54 ( right ) take part in a training session on thursday @entity55 ( right ) looks on during training as @entity54 ( left ) picks up a cone and talks to @entity113 and @entity114 ' i think it was a combination of some change in personnel and a difficult pre-season coming off the back of a @entity3 on an @entity122 tour where we only had 10 senior players			1
but you can look at the form from then on , and see that we have really put things right since			0
' the first win of the run came on september 16 at home in the @entity12 when @entity132 were on the wrong end of a 5 - 1 hammering			1
@entity5 then put eight past @entity135 and five more past @entity136			2
suddenly they were averaging six goals a game and it was n't all easy home wins against intimidated opposition either			2
they went to @entity143 and won 2 - 0 and they then travelled to @entity144 and saw off @entity14 2 - 1			2
then came the real test - @entity145 home and away and @entity23 in the space of just two weeks			2
they made it look easy			0
the @entity5 players huddle around during training ahead of saturday 's match with @entity4 @entity54 ( left ) streches his leg up high during training as his team - mates follow him @entity58 ( right ) speaks with assistant coach @entity157 during the training session on thursday @entity159 ( left ) laughs during training as @entity55 ( centre ) and @entity58 look on video an unforgettable year for @entity5 - @entity58 ' going to @entity162 is always difficult because of that atmosphere , ' says @entity100			1
' it 's like another player for them			0
but we did really well after a difficult first 20 minutes			0
we got the goal and calmed the crowd			0
' real ran - out 3 - 0 winners and former @entity171 forward @entity54 was even applauded off by the @entity172 when substituted			2
@entity23 turned up at the @entity173 in the next game and were still yet to concede a goal			0
they scored first with debutant @entity176 setting up @entity177			0
but @entity5 were too strong and eventually ran out 3 - 1 winners			1
after victories over @entity180 and @entity181 , @entity145 visited @entity5 with a drastically changed team from the first leg			1
@entity185 ' personnel and tactics were different but the result was just the same with @entity5 winning 1 - 0			1
@entity54 ( centre ) laughs during the training session on thursday in @entity56 the players huddle around in the centre of the training pitch in @entity56 with three mighty scalps under their belts the @entity5 steamroller has gone on flattening everyone put in its path since			2
on their 21 - game run , they have scored 79 goals			1
nine of those have come from outside the box , eight have been from the penalty spot and 15 have been headers			0
they have also passed teams into submission with a total of 12,128 - while their share of possession has only dropped below 50 per cent four times , against @entity213 , @entity23 , @entity143 and @entity214			1
and while @entity54 and company have been running wild at one end , the defence has held firm at the other , with only 10 goals conceded			0
it will not be easy to take the world record			1
@entity4 will provide tough opposition on saturday and having to play @entity32 once and @entity37 twice at the turn of the year is not ideal			1
but , on the evidence of the last four months , it is clear that nothing is beyond this team .			0

@entity5 have won 21 games in succession since september 16
they have scored 79 goals , conceding just 10 in the *process*
