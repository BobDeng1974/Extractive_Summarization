it 's the series that will open your eyes to the wonders of the animal world			1
yesterday , nature writer @entity5 revealed the astonishing lives of birds			1
today , he tells why you should learn to love vampire bats - and rats ... the world would be a much happier place if humans were more like vampire bats			1
it ’s their unselfishness i ’m talking about : the free giving of something you need but are prepared to surrender to another			2
we humans like to think that altruism in any form is uniquely human : a real and above all moral division between us and the rest of the animal kingdom			2
vampire bats contradict this view			1
all kinds of legends have built up around this pint - sized creature of the night , but one bit at least is true : that they do actually drink blood			1
there are three species : the white - winged vampire and the hairy - legged vampire prefer the blood of birds , and are adept at clambering through the branches to reach nests and nestlings			1
it ’s said that the bite is not painful , although — or perhaps because — they use razor - sharp incisors to remove the skin ; the resulting wound has been described as looking like a golfer ’s divot			1
vampires are around 4in long , with a wingspan of 7in or so			2
they are adept on the ground , crawling with agile speed to reach a target and search out a convenient blood vessel			1
the anti-coagulant in their saliva allows the blood to flow , and they lap it up like a cat with a saucer of milk ; on a good night they can take a meal of half their own body weight			1
this sounds as if all the odds favour the bats , but this is not so			1
it ’s common for a vampire bat to go through a night without a meal ; within three days it will have starved to death			1
blood - hunting is a skill that improves over time : year - old bats will fail one night in three ; experienced animals fail only one night in ten			1
all the same , failure is a fact of life for even the best blood - hunters			1
dinner : anti-coagulant in their saliva allows the blood to flow , and they lap it up like a cat with a saucer of milk vampires are social creatures , coming back to the same day - roost at the end of every night			1
there are some big colonies , up to 2,000 , but most are much smaller , and centre on a core population of females who , even if not related , tend to know each other well			2
a bat who has failed to find blood in a night ’s flying will beg a meal from a neighbour			1
from a friend , we would say , if we were n’t so terrified of sounding anthropomorphic			2
the friend will then regurgitate blood , thus sharing a meal			1
under this system , females have been known to live for up to 15 years			0
reciprocal altruism is still altruism ; obviously this is a system that works on a mutual back - scratching basis			1
human society depends on the small kindnesses that you perform as a matter of course and that you expect to be performed for you in turn			0
but it is not just humans who are humane			0
seagulls that haunt landfill sites , pigeons that fly around city centres , cockroaches in our kitchens : all these we treat with contempt			0
but when it comes to fear and loathing in the animal kingdom , nothing beats a rat			0
the brown rat is one of the great success stories of the last millennium			0
not known in @entity163 before the 11th century , it has become a seldom - seen omnipresent fact of town and country life			1
rubbish reputation : but the brown rat is one of the greatest success stories in nature in 1,000 years we are never more than 10ft from a rat in a city , so they say : information designed to make our flesh creep			0
there are more rats than people in @entity163 ; in @entity182 alone there are said to be 100 million of them			2
i live in the countryside and keep horses and chickens — so naturally , i have rats			2
they pollute my animals ’ feed and they damage stuff , so i try to control them , which is a euphemism for killing them			0
but why , actually , is there a need for wild species to be under human control ? the idea of losing control , of being unable to regulate the numbers of wild animals we have around us , is something that profoundly distresses us modern humans			0
it is an insult to our omnipotence , a serious challenge to our understanding of ourselves and our place on the planet			0
humans define ourselves by our control — and yet there is a contradiction within 10ft of you			0
we may be able to eradicate a lot of species with great efficiency , both on purpose and by accident , but there are some species that we simply ca n’t control , no matter how hard we try			0
they are just too good for us : too smart , too well adapted , too effective			0
@entity227 : we may be able to eradicate a lot of species with great efficiency , but there are some we simply ca n’t western civilisation has never had many good things to say about rats , for all that they have been roped into thousands of scientific experiments for the very good reason that rats can tell us an awful lot about human beings			1
but some cultures are less single - minded in their detestation of rats			1
i have visited a @entity243 temple in southern @entity244 in which the rats were not only fed but honoured			1
in some @entity244 cultures , rat meat is considered a delicacy			1
in the @entity250 horoscope , the year of the rat is by no means inauspicious ; its natives are said to be creative , intelligent , generous , honest and ambitious			0
there is a fine statue commemorating a rat with such qualities in @entity256 , @entity257 ; you can find it if you do the @entity260 , a stroll that takes you past a number of @entity264 temples			1
it ’s a walk devised for contemplation of higher things			0
what ’s to hate about rats anyway ? sure , they ’re ubiquitous , destructive and far too effective at breeding			2
but as you stroll on the @entity274 ’s walk , you are entitled to ask yourself : well , who is n’t ? not far behind the rat in the fear and loathing department comes the hyena			0
these are the cheats of the animal world , scavenging the leftovers of the noble lions , stealing the kill from the leopards and giving everyone the willies when they are caught in the safari vehicle ’s headlights with their grinning @entity291 - mask faces			1
laughing : they are cheats and scavengers - but hyenas have big brains and a better social life than lions the bare skin of the face gives them a particularly malevolent appearance ; it does n’t help when you explain that this is an adaptation that helps them to keep clean , a useful thing for a beast that spends so much of its time with its head stuck in corpses			1
the spotted hyena is the one we are most familiar with , from wildlife documentaries if not from experience on safari			0
their glorious whooping calls — they like to keep in contact with each other — are one of the great sounds of the @entity323 night : a spine - tingler for the first - timer , and providing a sense of homecoming for those of us who keep going back			1
hyenas always have an air of being up to no good , of being caught in the middle of some episode that even they must admit is rather shaming , but they ’re going to do it anyway , so off they go into the bush , grinning hard			2
yet there is a lot to recommend a hyena			0
their social life is rigidly efficient , and they have big and complex brains , which make this possible			1
they live by the clan , and everything they do is tied up with the female dominant hierarchy that underpins it			0
this contrasts with the social life of lions , which always seems to operate in a haphazard and rough - and - ready way			1
lions seem to be making it up as they go along , and are perfectly capable of breaking all their own rules			0
there is beauty to be found in the hyena			0
its sense of smell is more than 1,000 times more acute than ours round a kill , the male does what he wants and everybody else scraps for the next bite , rather than waiting for a preordained turn , though the alpha male lion will tolerate a cub — but no one else — eating alongside him			0
lions are highly social but not really on top of their own social lives , in a manner that reminds me of modern humans			2
but hyenas have it all worked out			2
the boss female is in charge			2
it has been estimated that the top female is two - and - a - half times more likely to raise successful young than any of her peers			2
a hyena den is , against all expectations , a lovely sight : always busy and playful			0
the pups , all black , look as if they would be perfectly at home on your hearthrug			0
there is great beauty to be found in the hyena			0
its sense of smell is more than 1,000 times more acute than our own			0
their powerfully muscled jaws and bone - crushing premolars give them one of the most effective bites in the world			1
as so often , the truth and beauty of the creatures we live with are obscured by human traditions and untrue assumptions			2
we are not encouraged to look closely or think afresh about non-human animals because , after all , we know everything			0
