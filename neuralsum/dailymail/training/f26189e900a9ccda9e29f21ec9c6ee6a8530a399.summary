by @entity0 published : 06:19 est , 3 july 2012 updated : 19:30 est , 3 july 2012 @entity1 has confessed that he took part in a tax avoidance scheme until a crisis of conscience caused him to change his mind			1
the @entity8 ’s world affairs editor , 67 , revealed that he had placed his @entity10 townhouse in the trust of a @entity13 - based company overseen by his @entity15 wife @entity14			1
the plan was to avoid inheritance tax or stamp duty in the event of a future sale of the @entity23 property , which he bought for £ 1.85million back in 2004 , and the offshore scheme was entirely within the law			2
@entity27 : @entity1 , pictured with his wife @entity28 , said his £ 1.85million @entity10 home was placed in an off - shore company until he decided to end the legal arrangement recently but @entity32 , who has reported from 30 war - torn countries in a career spanning more than 40 years , said he recently came to the conclusion that paying tax is one of the ‘ duties of a citizen of this country ’			1
he said he had come to his decision before the recent tax avoidance controversy involving @entity43 and @entity44 became public			2
@entity32 said he had decided to put his house back under his and his wife ’s names – even though doing so could land him with a six - figure capital gains tax bill in addition to liability for inheritance tax and stamp duty if he sells the house			1
duty : @entity1 , the @entity8 's @entity55 editor , said it was ' absolutely right ' for a citizen of @entity57 to pay tax to the government of the day - even though it 's painful - but he said it was part of a citizen 's ' duties ' @entity32 told the @entity64 : ‘ it ’s absolutely right for a citizen of this country to pay whatever amount of tax , within reason , the government of the day feels is required			1
it ’s painful but i think that ’s part of the duties of a citizen of this country ’			1
shamed : comedian @entity43 was publically vilified after it was revealed that he was keeping his £ 3.3 million fortune in a completely legal tax scheme in @entity78 last month , stand - up comedian @entity43 issued an apology for his ‘ terrible error of judgment ’ after it was revealed that he kept his £ 3.3million fortune in a legal tax avoidance scheme in @entity78 which saw him pay as little as 1 per cent tax on his earnings			2
more than 1,000 people , including @entity88 , are thought to be using the same @entity90 scheme , which could be hiding around £ 168million a year from the @entity91			2
@entity32 also hit out at the @entity8 for sidelining @entity92 during last month ’s @entity94 coverage in favour of younger faces , saying : ‘ this has not been a good time in the @entity8 for people who say , “ let ’s just have young people ”			0
‘ as a viewer , as well as a performer , i just missed @entity92 so much			0
i do find it a bit odd that we ’ve got this state - of - the - art @entity106 that for some reason we do n’t always bring out for these occasions			0
’ it comes a week after @entity32 said he would consider euthanasia in old age rather than be reduced to a ‘ gibbering wreck ’ who is reliant on a carer to manage basic functions			0
@entity32 married his second wife , miss @entity14 – who is 19 years his junior – in 1996			0
she gave birth to their six - year - old son @entity120 in 2006			0
