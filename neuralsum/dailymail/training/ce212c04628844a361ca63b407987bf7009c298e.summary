by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 's side left it late to beat @entity5 on the opening day of the @entity8 season , with @entity9 stealing all three points for the @entity11 with a winner in added time			1
the @entity15 midfielder was by no means the stand - out performer at the @entity17 though , as @entity18 performed well for the hosts and former @entity21 striker @entity20 played brilliantly for @entity5			1
was n’t fully tested but mopped up when called upon			0
@entity40 - 6 the @entity41 was slow to get forward down the right for the @entity11			1
yet to show his best form n an @entity21 shirt following his summer move from @entity46			0
ponderous : @entity21 right - back @entity40 was not at his best against @entity5 on saturday afternoon @entity48 - 6.5 picked up a silly booking for hauling @entity50 down , but a solid debut for the youngster who does n’t look at all overawed after a summer move from @entity54			1
@entity55 - 7 @entity56 , as we ’ve come to expect from the @entity41			1
frighteningly close to giving away a penalty at one end , then scored just before half - time			1
handled the added burden of coaxing @entity62 through his debut well			0
firing the @entity11 level : @entity55 , right , is congratulated by @entity66 after making it 1 - 1 @entity68 - 6 failed to really get down the line as much as he ’d like			1
decent battle with @entity72 with no clear winner before coming off with a niggle			0
@entity75 - 5.5 @entity76 was over-run in midfield and his performance brought into focus the need for another body in there			1
@entity18 - 6.5 while he did give the ball away frequently early on , a vibrant display full of energy and packed with a desire to get alongside @entity86			2
late rally : @entity9 , far right , completed an impressive comeback for @entity3 's side with his late goal @entity9 - 6.5 looked a frustrated figure for much of the afternoon and was strangely subdued			1
plenty more to come , of course , but the @entity93 overhit too many final balls			0
but you can never keep him out of a game and up he popped in stoppage time to win it			0
@entity66 - 5.5 home attacks often ended with @entity66 , who lacked the cutting edge to break down a stubborn visiting side			1
@entity102 - 6 a case of trying too hard , @entity102 looked bright but very little came off and the @entity104 needs to play centrally			2
excellent clipped delivery for @entity55 ’s equaliser			1
not quite clicking : @entity104 forward @entity102 had an up - and - down day at the office for the home side @entity109 - 5 almost looks like a player who ’s unsure what ’s expected of him or the role in which he ’s playing			1
languid style does n’t help and offered nothing off the ball			0
@entity116 @entity117 - threatening down the left , looked fitter than last season			2
@entity120 - struggled to impose himself on proceedings			2
@entity21 a different dimension and his presence alone was a deciding factor in @entity21 winning this			0
little impact : @entity120 was introduced in the closing stages but failed to leave his mark @entity5 @entity129 - 6.5 very little to do , but made one superb save from @entity18 before the end of the first half			2
@entity132 - 6.5 did n’t have a man to mark directly but kept his concentration and marauded forward with purpose			2
@entity136 - 6 classy glanced header put @entity5 ahead , but he was then guilty of losing @entity55 for the equaliser			1
first impressions : @entity142 defender @entity136 is mobbed by his @entity5 team - mates after scoring @entity144 - 7 @entity5 ’s best signing last year and started this well			2
constantly organising the back four , strong in the air and had @entity86 in his pocket before being forced off			0
@entity150 - 6.5 unsung hero in last year ’s survival and went about his business professionally without much fuss			2
kept @entity102 quiet for long spells			0
@entity72 - 6 one of the most exciting players to watch in the @entity8			2
direct runner with an eye for goal and plenty of tricks in his locker			0
forever a nuisance , but let himself down badly by catching @entity167 studs up and was deservedly sent off			0
composed in the middle : palace midfielder @entity169 shields the ball from @entity21 's @entity102 neat and tidy : palace captain @entity172 nicks the ball from @entity9 during the second half @entity172 - 7 carried on where he left off last season			1
composed on the ball , kept things ticking over in the middle of the park but , more importantly , was disciplined in @entity5 ’s shape			0
@entity169 - 7 has always been a good reader of the game and is now growing into the central midfield role			1
@entity186 - 6 not at his best but the threat of @entity186 ’s pace in behind is almost as dangerous as the winger ’s ability			0
always a threat : @entity186 's pace meant he looked dangerous throughout for the visiting side star of the show : much - maligned during his stay at the @entity17 , @entity20 shone for @entity5 on his return @entity20 - 7.5 superb			1
asked to do a very specific job by @entity202 - dropping in to make five in midfield without the ball - and he followed the caretaker ’s instructions to the letter			1
even picked up a grubby booking for a late challenge on @entity18 and did n't deserve to be on the losing side			0
@entity50 - 6.5 because of @entity20 ’s very specific role , the striker found himself a isolated on occasion			1
did well to hold the ball up in tricky circumstances			0
@entity116 @entity216 - brought on for the injured @entity217 to shore up the back four but could only watch as @entity21 nicked it late on			0
@entity220 - @entity219 some light relief late on			0
@entity223 - related substitution in stoppage - time .			0

palace striker @entity20 was the best player on the pitch at the @entity17
@entity55 impressed for @entity3 's side
the visitor 's central - midfield pairing of @entity172 and @entity169 performed well for new coach @entity202
