hiding spot : @entity9 ran from the bathroom into @entity16 's closet which had two exits in order to get away from him , but then she remembered where he hid his gun on the top shelf of his closet the scene : the defense attorney showed a picture of @entity16 's closet and @entity9 pointed out where he hid his gun on a top shelf which she knew because she cleaned it previously when she was working as his maid her story : @entity9 ' defense is based entirely around the fact that she killed @entity16 in self - defense and that she lied multiple times to investigators because she was trying to avoid jail the focus of wednesday ’s testimony was the events of june 4 , 2008			1
@entity9 ' mother wiped her eyes while in court while @entity2 's two sisters looked down as their brother 's last moments were described			1

she began developing alternate versions of events which she told police investigator @entity202 when he questioned her repeatedly about the murder			2
firstly , she said that she was not in @entity18 at the time of his death and later that a man and a woman broke into his home and attacked @entity16			2
@entity9 said on wednesday : ' i began to tell him things that i thought would comport with what the forensics would show as well as create - not an excuse but - create a way that would have me not have been responsible for it			2
' emotional : @entity9 said that her actions following the murder - which included driving to @entity219 , spending time with another romantic interest , and leaving voicemails on @entity16 's phone - were to ' throw them off the scent ' final moments : she got choked up when she was shown one of the pictures she took of @entity16 during their shower photo shoot , and she was unsure whether or not that was the final picture she took of him hardest day : @entity16 's sisters looked down as @entity9 told of the moment he was killed support : @entity9 ' mother was seen wiping her eyes with tissues at different points during the testimony as for her rationale as to why she would develop the story that a man and a woman broke into the house , she said that it was both practical ( ‘ @entity202 told me repeatedly that it had to have been more than one person ’ ) and symbolic			1
she said : ‘ it sounds a little esoteric but it could have been symbolic : it ’s like @entity119 and i were the ones fighting that day			0
' she said that she attended @entity16 's memorial service to keep up appearances and wanted to go to his funeral but was unable to make it			0
‘ i thought that if i did n’t show up it would look suspicious because @entity119 and i were close and a lot of people knew that , ’ she said			0
another reason she wanted to attend was because during their relationship , the pair had a conversation about what @entity16 would do if she were ever to die			0
@entity9 told the court : ‘ he was going to give a eulogy if i ever died … he said he would have come to mine even if it was in @entity270			1

she said : ‘ i was very concerned about both of our reputations and i did n't want to start throwing him under the bus so to speak because there were already people hurting and i did n’t see what benefit it would be to talk about those things			0
' during the time between the june 4 murder and her arrest on july 15 , @entity9 purchased a gun			1
her defense lawyer @entity272 repeatedly asked her about whether or not she tried to kill herself following the murder , though she said that the purchase of her gun had nothing to do with her suicide plans			1
