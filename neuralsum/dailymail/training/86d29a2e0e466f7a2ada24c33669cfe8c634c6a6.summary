by @entity1 reporter published : 03:19 est , 17 october 2012 updated : 11:28 est , 17 october 2012 young people do not want to work or find themselves a job , according to the management at one of the @entity7 's largest care home groups			1
@entity8 , which employs 15,000 staff across 200 care homes across the @entity7 , has failed to fill nearly 1,000 vacancies this year despite high youth unemployment			1
the group has 600 paid youth apprenticeship places but has only managed to get 100 under - 25s onto the scheme			1
the placements last up to six weeks with a strong chance of a paid job at the end of the scheme â€“ but many recruits do n't even bother turning up			1
some young people just do n't seem keen on work			2
many are not turning up or turning up late , some are swearing , they 're just not interested			0
@entity35 is really embarrassed , they 've rung us apologising			0
' the ones that do turn up have been sent by the job centre and are just going through the motions or they wo n't get their benefits			0
' she added : ' it is very frustrating to have apprenticeships available and not have them filled , particularly given the numbers out of work around the country			2
' the company has also only managed to fill a fraction of nearly 1000 general vacancies it has available			1
failing : the company claims many are leaving school completely unprepared for the working world the company human resources director , @entity56 , said many young people just do n't have the motivation for work as the latest figures reveal that there are 1.2million people aged between 16 and 24 who are out of work			1
and the number of under 25s out of work for at least two years has more than doubled in the last four years			2
mr @entity56 told @entity67 : ' we have seen numerous examples of young people not able to arrive on time , having no questions to ask what the job entails or what the company does , or simply having no confidence and are unable to even make eye contact			0
' it breaks my heart to say it , but schools simply have not prepared them for the world of work			0
' i think it is very sad for our society that so many young people can not do a job interview			0
