by @entity0 published : 06:10 est , 4 january 2013 updated : 06:20 est , 4 january 2013 police are hunting for vandals who wrecked more than a dozen graves at a city cemetery over the @entity5			1
the thugs did thousands of pounds of damage at @entity8 in @entity9 , which had been left unlocked so that members of the public could visit and mourn their relatives over the festive period			1
one man was devastated to discover that three memorials to members of his family had been smashed up - and said the attack had brought him ' heartache and grief '			1
a total of 17 headstones - including that of a nine - year - old child - were targeted at the cemetery and the neighbouring crematorium			2
devastation : @entity28 and @entity29 with the desecrated graves of three family members the city council had asked the contractor which manages the site to keep it open over @entity35 and the @entity5 so it was accessible to the families of those buried there			1
but at some time between tuesday morning and wednesday morning , a group of yobs started pulling headstones down and kicking them to break them up			2
@entity43 drove from @entity44 to @entity9 after a cousin told him that three of their family graves had been attacked			1
shattered stones , a broken angel 's head and a smashed figure of @entity53 now lay where flowers and figurines once stood in memory of his father , grandfather and uncle			1
' i do n't know what we are going to do , ' the 56 - year - old said			0
' the damage is several thousand pounds			0
' three marble statues of angels , between 4ft and 6ft tall , were pushed over and broken at the @entity29 family plot			2
@entity70 : police are now searching for the vandals who targeted 17 graves at @entity8 in @entity9 ' what enjoyment can you get out of doing something like that ? ' , mr @entity43 added			1
' they just cause heartache and grief for the family			1
' mr @entity43 's father and grandfather , both also called @entity28 , were buried in the plot in 1984 and 1968			1
his grandmother @entity86 was added to his grandfather 's plot in 1991 and his uncle @entity89 , whose grave cost £ 17,000 , was laid to rest in 2008			2
mr @entity43 's wife @entity91 , 55 , said : ' they 've been up all these years and you do n't expect anything to happen			2
' a @entity96 spokesman said : ' we find it very sad that a minority of people took it upon themselves to vandalise some of the memorials and show such careless disregard for all that cemeteries stand for and we sympathise with the families involved			0
previous incident : this cemetery in @entity107 was wrecked in 2011 at a cost of more than £ 100,000 destroyed : @entity109 went on a bizarre spree ripping up gravestones to the devastation of families ' we asked our contractor to leave the cemetery gates open over the @entity5 period so that people could pay their respects at any time			1
' but by their very nature , cemeteries are not created to be fortresses			0
instead , they are designed to be accessible , dignified and peaceful places for anyone who has lost a loved one and wants to pay their respects			0
' a stonemason was set to visit the cemetery today to start repairing the damage			0
the contractor said that it would pay the costs of restoring the memorials			0
@entity134 , of @entity135 , branded the yobs ' heartless ' , saying : ' we take these types of offences extremely seriously and in each case will make every effort to find those responsible			0
' we need the public 's help in order to do this and i would urge anyone who may have witnessed people acting suspiciously in the area to come forward			0
' the attack is reminiscent of a rampage in 2011 which saw @entity109 wreak £ 100,000 worth of damage at a cemetery in @entity107 .			0

@entity9 graveyard had been left open over @entity5 for family visits
@entity43 spoke of ' grief and heartbreak ' at seeing *carnage* wreaked on graves of his father , grandfather and uncle
