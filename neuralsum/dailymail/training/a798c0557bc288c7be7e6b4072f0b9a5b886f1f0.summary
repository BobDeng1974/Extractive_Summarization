by @entity0 ' ugliest side of @entity2 ' : @entity3 , a @entity4 and @entity2 spokesman on immigration was criticised for comments which ' overlap with the far - right ' a senior @entity2 politician plunged his party into fresh controversy last night after calling on @entity11 to sign a special code of conduct to prove they reject violence			1
@entity3 , a @entity16 mep and the party ’s spokesman on immigration , said it was a big mistake for @entity21 to allow ‘ an explosion of mosques across their land ’			1
the comments will heap further pressure on leader @entity27 , who has vowed to rid his party of what he called ‘ @entity31 ’ types			1
last month he was forced to suspend a town councillor who suggested that the country was suffering floods because of @entity36 ’s gay marriage policy			0
mr @entity27 also had to get rid of another mep , @entity3 , after he called some women ‘ sluts ’ and warned against sending aid to ‘ @entity24 ’			2
last night critics attacked the latest comments from mr @entity3 , a member of the party ’s executive , saying they represented the ‘ ugliest side of @entity2 ’ and ' overlap with the far - right '			1
the @entity3 told @entity46 that he stood by his call for a ‘ charter of @entity50 understanding ’ , which he first suggested in 2006			1
the document asks @entity11 to sign a declaration rejecting violence and says that certain parts of the @entity55 that promote ‘ violent physical jihad ’ should be regarded as ‘ inapplicable , invalid and @entity57 ’			0
asked on tuesday about the charter , mr @entity3 said he had written it with a friend , who is an @entity50 scholar , and could not see why ‘ any reasonable , normal person ’ would object to signing it			1
he also repeated his view that some @entity50 texts need updating , claiming some say ‘ kill @entity66 wherever you find them and various things like that ’			2
‘ if that represents the thinking of modern people , there ’s something wrong , in which case maybe they need to revise their thinking , ’ he said			0
‘ if they say they can not revise their thinking on those issues , then who ’s got the problem - us or them ? ’ asked why @entity11 have been singled out , rather than followers of other faiths like @entity87 or @entity66 , mr @entity3 said : ‘ @entity87 are n’t blowing people up at the moment , are they ? are there any bombs going off round the world which are claimed by @entity87 organisations ? i do n’t think so			1
’ in an interview four years ago , mr @entity3 also proposed a ban on new mosques across @entity21 , suggested @entity50 countries should not be ‘ appeased ’ and warned of the threats of having ‘ two incompatible systems living in the same place at the same time ’			1
mr @entity3 is top of the party ’s @entity102 candidate list for @entity16 , having passed a round of psychometric testing to make sure his views were acceptable			1
he is also a former candidate for @entity16 mayor			0
@entity11 celebrate @entity108 in @entity16 : mr @entity3 is asking @entity11 to sign a declaration rejecting violence and saying that parts of the @entity55 that promote ' violent physical @entity56 ' should be regarded as ' inapplicable ' asked yesterday whether he still believed @entity11 should sign the charter , @entity3 said : ‘ i do n’t suppose the @entity113 would disagree with it or the archbishop of @entity116 or anybody else			2
‘ so why should they feel aggrieved that they might be asked to sign			0
they do n’t have to			0
if they do n’t believe in those five points , they do n’t have to sign it			0
’ in the 2010 interview , mr @entity3 suggests a ban on new mosques in ‘ our cities ’ and warns it was wrong to have allowed so many already			2
‘ they do n’t allow @entity87 churches or @entity128 temples to be built or any kind of non-muslim place of worship in many of their countries and certainly not in the heartland of their religion , ’ he said			0
‘ well , if they do n’t allow it , why can they expect to see their religion tolerated somewhere else ? ’ last night @entity141 , @entity142 mp for @entity143 and @entity144 , said mr @entity3 ’s position was ‘ shocking ’			2
‘ if @entity27 had any credibility , he would quite clearly not allow this individual to stand for office in @entity2 , ’ he said			0
@entity149 , @entity151 ’s shadow @entity16 minister , also said he was ‘ appalled at the ignorance that @entity3 appears to have shown when speaking about the faith that i and hundreds of thousands of @entity156 @entity11 practice ’			2
@entity157 , a @entity3 for @entity16 , said @entity3 ‘ represents the ugliest side of @entity2 ’			0
‘ @entity3 ’s views overlap with the far - right , ’ she said			1
‘ the idea that @entity11 should be singled out in the way he suggests is a relic from a darker , more prejudiced time			0

@entity3 *slammed* for comments that ' overlap with the far - right '
he claims he *co-authored* the document with friend who is an @entity50 scholar
but his comments look likely to heap *embarrassment* on his party
