as pressure mounts for a last - minute deal to avoid across - the - board spending cuts , it became clear tuesday that patience was running thin in the @entity6 @entity5 as speaker @entity7 lambasted the @entity8 for not getting ' off their ass ' to ' do something ' about the looming friday deadline			1
@entity7 made the terse remark as he complained to reporters that the @entity5 has twice passed bills that would replace the $ 85 billion in spending cuts , which are scheduled to kick in friday , while the @entity8 has not acted			1
' we should not have to move a third bill before the @entity8 gets off their ass and begins to do something , ' the @entity18 leader barked			2
' you know that if @entity38 ca n’t get together and plan our nation ’s finances for the long term , that over time some of your jobs and businesses could be at risk , ' @entity25 told the company 's employees in remarks that were staged in front of a giant ship propeller			2
workers in hard hats were selected to from the crowd to stand around him			0
' over at the @entity58 , the threat of these cuts has already forced the @entity59 to cancel the deployment , or delay the repair of certain aircraft carriers , ' @entity25 said			2
' one that ’s currently being built might not get finished			0
another carrier might not get started at all			0
and that hurts your bottom line			0
' joining @entity25 on @entity70 for the trip to @entity72 were two @entity33 congressmen , democrat @entity74 and @entity18 @entity75			1
@entity25 gave @entity75 a shout - out during his remarks , while at the same time , he blasted @entity18 for ' holding up ' negotiations on a deal to avert the sequester			1
' i 've got to give @entity75 credit , ' @entity25 said			2
' he is one of your @entity18 congressmen who ’s with us here today - and that 's not always healthy for a @entity18 , being with me			0
' he ’s asked his colleagues in the @entity5 to consider closing tax loopholes instead of letting these automatic cuts go through			2
he ’s concerned about the deficit , and he ’s more than prepared to make some really tough cuts , but he wants to do it in a smart way			0
' president @entity25 traveled to @entity33 tuesday to the state 's largest industrial employer , @entity34 , to continue his campaign against the stalemate in @entity38 standing in front of a ship 's propeller , president @entity25 gestures as he speaks about about automatic defense budget cuts ' but , ' @entity25 added , ' i just have to be honest with you			1
there are too many republicans in @entity38 right now who refuse to compromise even an inch when it comes to closing tax loopholes and special interest tax breaks			0
and that 's what 's holding things up right now			0
' before @entity25 's remarks , @entity75 said he expected to take heat from @entity18 for appearing with the president at a public event			1
' i boarded the plane knowing that some would potentially misinterpret this , ' @entity75 said			0
but he said he had to take ' the unique opportunity to speak directly to the commander in chief and to ask him respectfully but clearly to put forth a definitive alternative to sequestration			0
' rep. @entity74 , @entity126 , left , and rep. @entity75 , @entity127 , right , speak to reporters on @entity70 , where they joined @entity25 on a trip to @entity33 @entity7 made the terse remark as he complained to reporters that the @entity5 has twice passed bills that would replace the $ 85 billion in spending cuts while the @entity8 has not acted there has been no indication the @entity137 and congressional republicans are actively negotiating a deal			1
the last known conversation between @entity25 and @entity18 leaders was last week , although the @entity137 said the cuts would be among the topics discussed later tuesday when @entity25 meets with @entity18 sens. @entity143 and @entity144			1
@entity25 wants to replace the sequester with a package of targeted cuts and tax increases , while @entity18 leaders believe the savings should come from reduced spending alone .			1
