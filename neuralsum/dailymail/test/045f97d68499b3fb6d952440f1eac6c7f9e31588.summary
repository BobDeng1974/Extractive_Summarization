@entity1 style is hot right now			2
@entity2 , berry - coloured lips , round sunglasses and @entity6 logo t - shirts are all the rage with a new generation of fashion fans			2
but news that @entity11 , the brand responsible for the huge wideleg ' rave ' jeans , is set to make a comeback has horrified many of the people who wore the ridiculous pants the first time around			1
the return of the highly impractical jeans , which featured giant leg openings approaching 50in , has us contemplating the retro fashion nineties and @entity24 trends that really should be left in the past			1
the bucket hat a casual @entity35 piece , the bucket hat is characterised by its wide , downwards sloping brim and limp structure			2
originally a staple of fishermen and farmers , it soon enough found its way into popular culture and temporarily dominated the music scene			2
after gaining prominence in the @entity1 and early @entity24 , the trend was ditched in favour of softer and more flattering shapes , but fashion - forward celebrities such as 27 - year - old @entity51 are n't letting it go quietly			0
@entity53 : the bucket hat was originally a staple of fishermen and farmers , but seeped into popular culture , and was sported by the likes of singer @entity59 , now 36 , in 2001 now : pop star @entity51 , 27 , was spotted in july 2014 wearing a floppy bucket hat 2			0
@entity61 for those of us non-military personnel not in need of immediate concealment from predators , very few can understand why time and time again , camouflage print manages to seep into our wardrobes			1
usually in variations of olive and khaki - but also available in more garish shades - the pattern consists of shapeless blobs that imitate foliage			0
the brash pattern was favoured by @entity24 bands such as @entity81 's former band , @entity82 and today is seen on silk pants or sports luxe trousers worn by street smart stars such as 24 - year - old @entity87			1
@entity81 , now 33 , was a big fan of camouflage print in 2001 back when she was still with @entity82 @entity53 : @entity82 wore camouflage print in garish variations of bright blue back in 2001 now : @entity87 , 24 , attempted to bring back the camouflage look in the form of skinny trousers and a crop top in february 2015 3			1
taking it to the max sometimes a trend becomes so popular that a few fashion - forward thinking individuals try to take it to the extreme			0
designer prints and double denim are two styles that worked well for celebrity wardrobes in the @entity1 , and today young reality star , 17 - year - old @entity107 is one of many who definitely do n't follow the ' less is more ' style mantra			1
@entity53 : in the @entity24 , pop stars such as @entity113 , now 44 ( pictured left in 2000 ) , @entity111 , now 33 , and @entity114 , now 34 ( pictured middle to right in 2001 ) , loved to take trends to the maximum now : 17 - year - old reality star @entity107 sported double denim out and about in @entity119 earlier this month 4			1
ugg boots the shapeless sheepskin ugg boot was a huge celebrity trend in the @entity24 , with heiress @entity123 , 34 , owning piles of pairs			0
they are not pretty , or remotely glamorous , but the cosy factor means that they remain popular with off - duty actors and models today , with actress @entity131 , 34 , being one of the more modern fashion offenders			0
@entity53 : heiress @entity123 wore ugg boots at @entity135 in 2006 and now : @entity131 wears hers on set between takes earlier this month 5			0
@entity138 tiny , tiny denim shorts have been around for the longest time , but were brought back to popularity by @entity141 , 34 ( pictured below ) , in the film remake of @entity143 in 2005			1
extremely frayed , and impractically short , most stylish women are opting for slightly longer , more conservative styles this summer			0
but we can always count on @entity147 , 22 , to keep things flirty - wearing hers cut seriously high on the thigh			0
@entity53 : tiny denim shorts , aka @entity138 , were reintroduced to our wardrobes by @entity141 with the promotion of the film reboot of @entity143 in 2005 6			1
@entity155 @entity157 's matching two - piece velour tracksuits were the staple wardrobe of the likes of @entity160 , 33 , @entity123 , 34 , and @entity111 , 33 , in the @entity24			1

coloured sunglasses @entity178 lenses were a @entity1 favourite for boy bands such as * @entity181 and pop princesses like @entity111			0
these days they are sported by the likes of the mostly very stylish 22 - year - old model @entity185 and 17 - year - old reality star , @entity107 , with a mirrored sheen giving them a 2015 update			1

in the @entity1 they were being sported as outerwear , spearheaded by a very sexy @entity204 as @entity113 , now 44			0
and today they are being incorporated into dresses and tops to add edge to red carpet wear by young stars like 22 - year - old @entity210			0
@entity53 : @entity113 ( pictured in 2004 ) popularised wearing corsets and lingerie as outerwear in the @entity24 not very posh : @entity113 sported tight corset structured dresses to events such as the @entity218 movie awards in 2007 ( pictured left ) and the @entity219 in 2007 ( pictured right ) now : @entity210 works a sultry look to an awards ceremony with a corset - based gown 9			2
