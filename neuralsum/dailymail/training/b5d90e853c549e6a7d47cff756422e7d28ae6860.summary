rain in @entity1 appeared to come as a shock at @entity3 on friday when a stretch of outfield that could not cope with an hour ’s downpour forced the abandonment of the second day with @entity8 starting to pull away from @entity9			1
@entity10 faced anger from spectators who had seen the drainage system which enabled the bulk of the playing surface to recover from a heavy shower fail in one ugly , relaid area of the outfield that remained stubbornly unfit for play			0
it is an embarrassment for @entity10 , who prepared the best pitch of this series only to see the elements expose the inadequacies of the @entity3 facilities and hold up @entity8 ’s attempt to move into a winning position			1
it emerged that construction work earlier this year had caused turf to be relaid in front of the media centre in april and it had not bedded down in time for this test			0
cue a scarred area of sandy turf , a frustrated crowd , a black mark for @entity10 in highly competitive times for test match grounds and red faces to match the @entity70			0
it was left to @entity72 , the lugubrious @entity10 director of cricket , to offer the case for the defence of an @entity3 ground that suffered a similar controversy during a @entity78 game against @entity79 five years ago			0
‘ we ’ve had a massive downpour and this is an area used for construction purposes , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s got high - performing drains but what it has n’t got is turf knitted together over the years like the rest of the outfield			0
if we ’ve got anything wrong it was to go with the waterhog instead of letting it drain naturally			0
it looks a bit of a mess , we accept that			0
‘ you hope people look at the cricket that ’s been played and the quality of the pitch rather than five metres of a sandy puddle that affected an hour ’s cricket			0
’ waterlogged : the downpour in @entity1 left the @entity3 outfield looking like a reservoir dark skies : the clouds stopped above @entity3 and unleashed a rain storm down on to the outfield that may be so , but with terrible weather forecast for sunday , the drainage and outfield will be tested to the full and the time already lost could prove significant in what has become an absorbing fourth test			2
there seemed no way back for @entity9 from eight for four after just half an hour on thursday but on friday they ensured that @entity8 face a fight if they are going to emerge from @entity3 with at least a share of this series guaranteed			1
only when @entity33 and @entity37 began to take advantage of some curious tactics by @entity126 after lunch did @entity8 look likely to build the decisive first - innings lead that had looked assured when their bowlers ran riot on day one			1
clearly the fall of @entity132 in the last over of the first day had lifted @entity9 and they stayed in contention on friday , albeit without gaining the swing enjoyed by @entity30 and @entity137 , until that heavy rain arrived			2
@entity139 , who took just one wicket in the @entity142 innings , had been handed the perfect chance to prove his batting worth as nightwatchman and signalled his intent by hooking @entity147 aggressively for four			2
celebration : @entity9 players congratulate @entity150 ( second left ) after he dismisses @entity151 ( second right ) out the ground : @entity151 was clean - bowled by @entity150 as @entity9 took three early wickets in @entity1 @entity139 managed two more boundaries , even though one of them was inside - edged narrowly past his stumps , until he middled another pull from @entity159 and was athletically caught by a diving @entity150 at mid-wicket			1
@entity42 then moved to his 42nd test half - century before he was undone by the skill of @entity159			1
@entity164 ’s outside edge was defeated and @entity159 then took the same edge with the next ball with @entity42 expecting an inswinger			1
@entity151 ( right ) looked to take on the short ball , pulling @entity159 for successive fours that gave @entity8 the lead , but the ball after he had uncertainly steered @entity150 for two he was stuck on the back foot and bowled by a prodigious inswinger			1
enter @entity37 in vastly different circumstances from those which marked his debut , but he again showed his vast potential by knuckling down with @entity33 in an unbeaten partnership of 67 that was beginning to flourish before the rain			1
the pair were helped by some odd tactics by @entity126 which included bowling @entity184 both just before and after lunch when conditions were crying out for a burst from his seamers			0
it enabled @entity8 to move into a lead of 85 that could prove decisive — if the drainage system allows play to resume on saturday			2
@entity192 @entity42 ’s belligerent 58 continued his love affair with @entity3 , where he has made @entity194 runs at an average of 76			1
among batsmen who have played a minimum of six test innings here , only @entity199 ( 416 runs at 83 ) and @entity201 ( 818 at 81 ) average more			0
@entity203 's long wait @entity9 seamer @entity147 has now conceded 258 runs without taking a @entity194 wicket , sending down 384 balls in the process			2
but he has some way to go before he breaks the record of @entity9 ’s @entity210 , who waited 651 deliveries for his first test wicket .			2
