a dairy has shocked its customers by telling them they need to telephone the @entity2 to order their daily milk deliveries			1
instead of ringing the @entity8 depot two miles up the road , residents of @entity5 , @entity6 , have been told to contact a call centre in @entity11 , 7,000 miles away			1
@entity13 councillor @entity12 said : ' they have sent us all a letter saying they want us to pay by direct debit , but how do we know what milk we want or do n't want on a daily basis ? @entity8 claim customers have said their delivery service has improved since outsourcing customer calls ' and after all of these years i have decided to stop my milk being delivered			1
and people in the road have stopped theirs			0
' having to ring the @entity2 is diabolical			1
' a @entity8 spokesman has said many customer calls were handled within depots but around 60 per cent of these were not being answered			2
the spokesman declined to say why the company would not hire a full - time staff member to respond to customers who phone in , but said ' we 're trying to compete with all the other retailers '			1
under the current arrangements , more than 90 per cent of enquiries are picked up			0
' many long time customers have said their service has improved , ' the spokesman claimed			2
landscape gardener from @entity42 , @entity43 , said he ordered milk three times a week via direct debit			2
' you can change your order the night before , i find there 's no problem with it , ' he said			0
' it 's far more cost effective but i think it 's a generational thing , some are technophobes and still like to order with the milkman			0
' @entity8 has said residents who prefer to pay in cash can still do so and in most cases offers doorstep customers a choice of payment options			1
they can either pay the milkman directly on a prearranged day or pay online			0
the spokesman said : ' if they choose to pay online we ask customers to register to create an account to set up a direct debit or automatic credit card payment and there is no minimum order			2
' they can change or amend an order up until 9pm the night before and when an order is amended a new bill is generated so they are not charged for milk or products they have not had			0
' with regard to the customers in @entity88 , we can confirm that a new roundsman has recently taken on this area and will be contacting them to arrange a collection time			0
' an agent for the call centre in the @entity2 , who answered a @entity97 local phone number on @entity8 's website , confirmed their base was in @entity11 but declined to give the name of the company			1
' i 'm afraid i 'm not allowed do that , ' the representative said			0
the agent said they answer @entity8 customer calls up to 5pm evening time in the @entity108 a customer call centre representative for @entity8 in @entity11 declined to give out the name of the company			1

residents in @entity6 need to ring 7,000 miles away with delivery *queries*
