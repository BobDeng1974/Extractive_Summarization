people at opposite ends of the political spectrum do n't just have different views - they even use their brains differently			0
researchers have found liberals and conservatives use different parts of the brain when they make risky decisions and these regions can be used to predict which political party a person prefers			1
the new study by a team of political scientists and neuroscientists suggests that while genetics or parental influence may play a significant role , being a @entity21 or a socialist changes how the brain functions			1
not on the same wavelength : scientists have found that people who express different political views use their brains differently doctor @entity28 , a researcher in neuropolitics at the @entity30 , has been working in collaboration with colleagues at the @entity33 on research that explores the differences in the way the brain functions in @entity39 liberals and conservatives			1
in a previous experiment , participants had their brain activity measured as they played a simple gambling game			2
dr @entity28 and his colleagues were able to look up the political party registration of the participants in public records			0
using this new analysis of 82 people who performed the gambling task , the academics showed that @entity54 and @entity55 do not differ in the risks they take			0
however , there were striking differences in the participants ' brain activity during the risk - taking task			2
the results may pave the way for new research on voter behaviour , showing better understanding of the differences in how liberals and conservatives think democrats showed significantly greater activity in the left insula , a region associated with social and self - awareness			1
however , @entity54 showed significantly greater activity in the right amygdala , a region involved in the body 's ' fight - or - flight ' system			0
the results suggest that liberals and conservatives engage different cognitive processes when they think about risk			1
in fact , brain activity in these two regions alone can be used to predict whether a person is a @entity89 or @entity54 with 82.9 per cent accuracy			2
by comparison , the longstanding traditional model in political science , which uses the party affiliation of a person 's mother and father to predict the child 's affiliation , is only accurate about 69.5 per cent of the time			0
another model based on the differences in brain structure distinguishes liberals from conservatives with only 71.6 per cent accuracy			1
the model also outperforms models based on differences in genes			0
dr @entity28 said : ' although genetics have been shown to contribute to differences in political ideology and strength of party politics , the portion of variation in political affiliation explained by activity in the amygdala and insula is significantly larger , suggesting that affiliating with a political party and engaging in a partisan environment may alter the brain , above and beyond the effect of heredity			0
' the results may pave the way for new research on voter behaviour , yielding better understanding of the differences in how liberals and conservatives think			1
dr @entity28 added : ' the ability to accurately predict party politics using only brain activity while gambling suggests that investigating basic neural differences between voters may provide us with more powerful insights than the traditional tools of political science			0

new study says while parental influence may play a role , being a @entity21 or a socialist changes how the brain functions
the results suggest that liberals and conservatives engage in different cognitive processes when they think about risk
