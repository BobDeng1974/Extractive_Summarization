a study has revealed that sexually active women who used condoms have greater quantities of beneficial bacteria called @entity15 compared to other forms of contraception			2
possessing healthy levels of the bacteria in that part of the body is associated with a lower incidence of itchiness and even a lower chance of being infected with @entity25			1
a study has revealed that sexually active women who used condoms have greater quantities of beneficial bacteria called lactobacillus compared to other forms of contraception			2
possessing healthy levels is associated with a lower incidence of itchiness and even a smaller chance of being infected with @entity25 researchers at @entity36 studied 164 healthy , married women in @entity38 , aged between 18 and 45 who were not using a hormonal form of birth control , according to a report by @entity43			1
among the participants , 72 were using condoms , 57 were using an intrauterine device ( @entity47 ) , and 35 were using the ' rhythm method ' , in which a couple abstains from sex on the days pregnancy is mostly likely			0
the scientists focused on lactobacillus , a group of bacteria that dominates the natural flora of the vagina for many women			1
the microbes , which produce lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide , help the vagina maintain an average ph of 4.5 , similarto the acidity of beer or tomato juice			0
this ' acidic buffer system ' , as the researchers called it , is thought to block harmful bacteria from taking up residence and causing infections			2
@entity15 ( pictured ) produce lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide , help the vagina maintain an average ph of 4.5 , comparable to the acidity of beer or tomato juice though there may not be a ' normal ' microbiome for a healthy vagina , the presence of lactobacillus is thought to help prevent bacterial vaginosis , which is an imbalance of vaginal bacteria that causes itching , unusual discharge and unpleasant smell			1
beneficial bacteria have even been linked to a decreased risk of hiv infection			0
the researchers found that the population of lactobacillus was significantly higher in the condom group			0
sexual activity can disrupt the balance of the vagina 's ecosystem , especially when semen ( which has a ph of 7.0 to 8.0 ) enters the mix , the researchers said			1
the results suggest that condoms can help the vagina maintain its natural acidic defenses , the researchers said			1
however , the researchers warned that condoms might not be the best way to prevent unwanted pregnancy for everyone			0
condoms have a failure rate of 15 per cent with ' average use ' , which takes into account human errors in using them			0
in contrast , iuds have a failure rate of 0.6 percent to 0.8 percent in the first year , and can be effective for more than a decade after insertion , the researchers said			0
the new study was published in the journal @entity116 .			0

lactobacillus are bacteria that dominate the natural flora of the vagina
they prevent itchiness and even infection , *including* of the @entity25 virus
it is thought condoms boost levels because they prevent *alkaline* sperm disrupting a vagina 's acidic ' ecosystem ' where bacteria *thrive*
