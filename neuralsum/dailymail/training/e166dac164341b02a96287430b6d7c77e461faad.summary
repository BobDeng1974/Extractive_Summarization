by @entity0 published : 09:56 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 02:54 est , 22 february 2013 mission : @entity2 works with the @entity3 to stamp out human trafficking she is a glamorous @entity5 star who has graced hundreds of red carpets			1
but the cause closest to @entity2 's heart is a long journey from the bright lights of @entity5 and into the dark world of human trafficking			1
in a moving interview with @entity14 , she told how one heartrending meeting with an imprisoned sex slave had changed her life and made her even more determined to end the trade she branded a ' hideous scourge '			1
the 45 - year - old described coming face - to - face with the woman , who was wrongly locked - up for killing the man who had taken her captive when she was 16			2
despite the real murderer confessing to the crime , she had still spent much of her youth in a jail cell			2
she had also endured years of horrific abuse at the hands of the human trafficker			2
he would routinely threaten her with black magic and say he would murder members of her family			2
‘ although she had wanted to commit suicide , she did not , ’ @entity2 said			2
‘ she told me “ i have nothing left to give on this earth , beside staying on and enduring to keep my brother alive			0
’ ‘ to see in her eyes deep , excoriating pain and yet to hear no bitterness in her words , after spending her entire youth incarcerated for a crime someone else ultimately confessed to , was extraordinary			0
’ ‘ more extraordinary still was her commitment to help others and become a fighter of this hideous scourge			0
’ @entity2 ’s latest project is @entity55 documentary @entity53 or bust which features the pioneering work of a small @entity59 charity @entity58			1
scroll down to watch the documentary survivors : @entity61 ( left ) was trafficked when she was 15 , and @entity62 ( right ) became a sex slave when she was just 12 - their stories are among those that have inspired @entity5 star @entity2 the project was set up to help victims of human trafficking in an innovative and highly unusual way – by sending bras to @entity53 where they can be sold by freed sex slaves			1
set up by @entity75 housewife @entity74 , who thought her appeal for unwanted lingerie would only have moderate success			1
but she was completely overwhelmed when women sent her 20,000 bras but was then faced with the fresh challenge of getting them shipped to @entity83			1
the problem was when @entity85 , the ceo of shipping company @entity86 stepped in and offered free transportation from @entity88 to @entity89			2
‘ @entity74 is an amazing person , a stay - at - home mom with a dream and gumption as big as the sky ’ , @entity2 said			0
‘ she proves that there are no limitations to what we can do to fight slavery if we put our minds and hearts to it			0
’ the actress said that the idea of selling bras was both surprising and inspirational			1
some of the thousands of unwanted bras donated by @entity59 women ready to be shipped out to @entity53 breast efforts : a group of former sex slave and human trafficking victims unload a box of bras donated by women in the @entity59 which they will sell in the local market ‘ i like the idea that these are items that would exclusively be bought by women , so that the women and girls selling them would n’t have to sell them to me , and possibly be intimidated or retrafficked by them			1
‘ they are being set up to succeed , in a safe zone			0
i think it was a great , genius idea and proves that you do n’t need money to fight human trafficking			0
‘ @entity74 ’s story shows that you do not need special expertise			2
everyone has something that they can do			0
’ the documentary features the stories of two women , @entity61 , who was trafficked when she was 15 , and @entity62 who became a sex slave when she was 12			1
both are now selling @entity58 bras and supporting themselves			1
‘ we lived in darkness , ’ @entity61 said before talking optimistically about the future			0
for the women of @entity53 , bras are a difficult item to acquire and highly - coveted			1
the people who sell them make about three time the living wage			1
@entity2 , 45 , said she was particularly moved by @entity61 ’s devotion to her child			0
gumption : the project was the brainchild of @entity59 housewife @entity74 ( left ) while @entity85 , ceo at the @entity86 shipping company , heard about the project and agreed to transport the bras from @entity88 to @entity89 for free bra aid : @entity75 - based charity @entity156 charity collected thousands of donated bras in the @entity59 to ship to @entity53 ‘ as a mom of four , i relate to her quest to make sure her daughter ’s life does not follow the same terrible road hers did , ’ she said			1
‘ she is an incredibly brave and beautiful person ’			0
the @entity166 actress was first exposed to the issue of modern - day slavery as a spokesman for @entity171 ’s campaign @entity172 three years ago			0
but she says it was meeting survivors of modern day slavery and human trafficking that really spurred her to take up the cause			0
she was asked to become a goodwill ambassador for the @entity181 ( @entity181 ) , something she considers a great honour			0
‘ i was thrilled with the reach and gravitas of the position , ’ she said			0
‘ it has been one of the most challenging and rewarding things i have ever undertaken			0
’ @entity2 said that she would encourage people to get involved in grassroots projects like @entity58 and urged people to get in touch with organisations battling to end sex trafficking			1
‘ she said : ' a first step could be a call to the @entity197 , a 24/7 hotline that not only is a highly effective tipline that leads to the rescue of thousands of trafficking victims , but an informational hub for those who want to get involved in the fight to end slavery			2
' they have a grid of nationwide abolitionist groups , so you can find one in your area that will appreciate your specific skill set			0
' if people would like to donate funds , no sum is too small to begin helping victims across the globe ; the @entity3 's @entity220 for the @entity221 gives grants to meticulously vetted ngos that work directly with victims , providing them with rescue and rehabilitation to reclaim their lives ; as we see with @entity156 does , these non-governmental organisations that can do truly miraculous things			1
