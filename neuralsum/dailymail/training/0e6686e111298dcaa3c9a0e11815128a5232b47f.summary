a computer boffin has built a makeshift 3d body scanner out of everyday gadgets and used it to create a replica of his father			0
@entity6 from @entity7 , @entity8 , used a gaming computer , wheel bearing , plywood and an @entity12 to make the prints which were then turned into a small model			1
he was inspired to start experimenting with the process through his membership of @entity17 , a non-profit art and technology organisation			2
genius : @entity6 from @entity7 , @entity8 , used a gaming computer , wheel bearing , plywood and an @entity12 to make a 3d printer			1
his father spins on a rotating wooden disk ( pictured ) end result : he then used the technology to create a replica model of his father as an undergraduate he studied computers but it was n't until he started using them for art that he started to get creative			2
to complete the process , which only takes around a minute , he uses the @entity12 as a scanner and places the subject on a rotating platform made of the plywood			1
it turns using a motor and a wheel bearing he bought off @entity43			0
the xbox console is fixed to a sliding podium , made out of a speaker stand , piping and some cords			1
as the subject spins while holding a pose , data is collected and then fed back through the gaming computer which recreates a 3d image			0
@entity6 told @entity54 : ' i started doing research and thinking about how to do full - body scanning in an efficient @entity58 most basic method is holding the sensor by hand and walking around people , dragging the cords behind			2
the scan : @entity6 ( left ) pulls the console on the stand up and down while the subject pulls a pose			1
the whole process takes only one minute ' i found some designs on how to build a turntable that a person could stand on			1
i also adapted a camera slider design to shuttle the @entity75			0
' i also determined what kind of computing power was needed to drive the 3d scanning and model generation			0
he added : ' it requires a very powerful graphics card to be able to process the scan data			0
most of the calculations are done on the graphics card rather than the cpu			0

@entity6 from @entity7 , @entity8 , created the model
the process takes around a minute with the subject standing on a platform
it rotates while the xbox console moves *vertically* on a *homemade* stand
