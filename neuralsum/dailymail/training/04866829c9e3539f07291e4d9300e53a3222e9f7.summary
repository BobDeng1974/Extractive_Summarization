a group of @entity2 musicians who took their dispute over a dead cat and two smashed tvs to @entity6 have revealed they faked it all to win settlement cash and a free trip to @entity10			1
@entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 really were roommates at the time of suit and they really did have a cat named trips , but @entity11 never drunkenly smashed the pet to death with a television			1
however , that 's exactly what they told @entity6 in 2010			2
and along with some other hilarious made - up details , their sham episode made for one of the most memorable episodes of the court reality show to - date			0
' absolutely none of it ' was real , @entity11 recently told @entity46 , before admitting : ' the cat existed			1
' ' his name was trips , and to my knowledge he 's still alive			2
he did end up running away , like , pretty soon after the show , though			0
' the idea began when @entity12 moved up to @entity2 from @entity58 and was in search of a way to make money			1
' so i told her we could come up with some story for @entity6 , and we would probably get the settlement and a free trip to @entity10 , ' he said			1
' i was aware that the cap for small claims was around four grand			0
@entity12 got real excited about it and emailed the show straight away			2
' ' @entity12 is nasty ' : their roommate @entity13 also appeared and pretended to be @entity76 - bashing ex-boyfriend in the story @entity12 hatched , @entity11 was black - out drunk when he started to become destructive until things devolved to the point that he was throwing things			1
he threw one tv into a wall then threw another , which @entity12 would claim crushed her cat to death			1
in the episode , @entity12 's sad facade begins to crack while she discusses the dead cat and at various other moments it seems as if both she and @entity11 are having a tough time not laughing			1
according to @entity11 , the producer they worked with was pretty clear that she knew none of it was real from the very start			2
' she called me and was like , " you know , you guys can comp your meals from when you get in , just save your receipts			0
but if you guys have receipts for the same restaurant , the whole thing is off , " ' he told @entity46			0
for your troubles : neither the producers nor @entity6 herself really seemed to believe the giggling roommates ' story , but they paid her $ 1,250 for the smashed property and kitty , nonetheless he said @entity6 herself seemed not to buy it , either			1
' our taping was so quick , ' he said			0
' i think the reason our taping was so short was because @entity6 ended up figuring out that we were lying			0
' during the arguments , @entity11 plays the lazy musician role and @entity12 pretends to cry over her dead cat while @entity6 scrutinizes their pictorial ' evidence , ' their roommate @entity13 also shows up in the episode and pretends to be @entity76 - bashing ex-boyfriend , though he is n't actually interested in men			1
then , just like that , the verdict : @entity12 was awarded $ 1,250			1
' we divided it between us , ' @entity11 said , along with his $ 250 appearance fee			2
' then we went to @entity136 's and used our money to have a lavish , silly lunch			0
' they also rented a convertible @entity140 and drove to @entity141 , where they blew much of the money drinking champagne and relaxing with friends all day			0
' it felt awesome , ' @entity11 told @entity46			0
' it felt so good			0
' so what they do with the money : the group immediately rented a convertible @entity152 , drove to @entity141 and drank champagne in a hot tub all day			0

@entity2 roommates @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 hatched the idea and made it on the air in 2010
the fake dispute claimed @entity11 drunkenly smashed two televisions , one of which killed @entity12 's cat trips
producers paid for them all to fly to @entity10 , eat for free and stay in a hotel and gave @entity12 $ 1,250
