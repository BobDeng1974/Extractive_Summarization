experts said the rise in the number of reported rapes and sexual offences was due in part to high profile historic cases like @entity8 's a surge in the number of sex attacks reported to police has fuelled the first rise in recorded crime for more than a decade			1
nearly 3.8million crimes were recorded by police last year , an increase of 2 per cent from 2013 , figures released yesterday revealed			1
and a record number of rapes and other sex crimes were logged – up by a third ( 32 per cent ) to 80,200 , or 220 a day			1
but experts say the rise – the first since 2003 - 04 – was partly because victims were ' more willing ' to report sex crimes , including historical ones , and police were more likely to take complaints seriously , in the wake of the @entity8 sex abuse scandal			1
@entity32 , chief executive of the @entity33 , which represents more than 130 rape and sexual violence charities , said : ' under - reporting is a real problem in sexual offence cases			0
' one of the effects of @entity42 , in the wake of @entity44 , has been it has brought sexual cases to the fore			0
the convictions of @entity48 and @entity49 have encouraged people to feel justified in coming forward			0
' the @entity51 , which published the data , said the rise was also due to police recording complaints more accurately after accusations of ' fiddling ' figures to meet targets			0
a police watchdog recently found a fifth of crimes were not being logged properly			1
the latest @entity51 figures showed that the number of murders and manslaughter cases in @entity65 and @entity66 has fallen to its lowest level for 38 years			2
police recorded 515 homicides last year , 37 fewer than in 2013			1
but the number of rapes recorded was the highest ever at 26,703 , which is an average of 73 attacks every day			1
rapes at knifepoint were up by 31 per cent to 311 attacks and there were 53,559 other sexual offences recorded			2
violent offences also jumped by 21 per cent to nearly 741,000			0
the @entity51 report said of the overall rise in recorded crime : ' this is the first increase since 2003 - 04 but needs to be seen in the context of the renewed focus on the quality of crime recording			2
' the high - profile convictions of @entity48 ( left ) and @entity49 ( right ) have made victims feel more confident about coming forward , said campaigners the number of crimes logged by police is still 20 per cent lower than in 2008 - 09 – under the last @entity94 government			1
the picture was complicated by figures from the @entity97 of @entity65 and @entity66 , which found a 7 per cent fall in overall crime to 6.9million incidents , the lowest level since 1981			0
the survey , which looks at people 's experiences of crimes , includes incidents not reported to police			2
but some crimes , such as bank and credit card frauds , are left out , distorting the true rate of offending			0
home secretary @entity112 said the data showed ' police reform is working ' and that crime ' has never been lower , meaning families are safer '			0
but her @entity94 shadow , @entity118 , claimed that the @entity51 figures ' expose the shocking complacency of @entity120 and @entity112 over crime and policing ' .			0
