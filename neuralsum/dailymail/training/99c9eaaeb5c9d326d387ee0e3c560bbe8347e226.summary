if selling his @entity1 medal gets @entity3 £ 50,000 , good luck to him @entity7 ' @entity6 gamble spectacularly backfired football is a results business			1
the end justifies the means			2
seeing that @entity7 switched his team around , lost to @entity6 and was then beaten at home by @entity16 , his gamble was not a success			1
@entity18 are now in the bottom half of the table , a point better off than @entity22			1
that is worrying , too , no matter the mitigation of injuries			2
nobody at @entity18 expected to be one - season wonders in @entity28 having returned to the @entity29 in such style			1
the controversy in @entity6 could prove damaging to @entity7 ’ personal ambitions , too			1
the big @entity34 clubs do not forget			2
despite not having their influential playmaker , @entity49 , @entity47 progressed 2 - 1 on aggregate			0
they won 1 - 0 at home , scored the away goal in @entity53 and then defended it , @entity55 - style			0
@entity46 were a good team that year			0
@entity56 was still in his prime and they won @entity59 losing just three games			0
and as a result of those matches , on odd occasions , @entity61 would receive a call from @entity53 asking if he might be interested in the @entity46 job			0
the timing was never right and the move did n’t happen , but on the back of two resilient performances — @entity47 were underdogs , but the better team over two legs — the @entity72 family kept his name on file			0
by contrast , how will @entity7 be recalled in @entity78 ? as the man who sent the second team out at the @entity40			1
they will not look beyond the team sheet or regard his decision as brave or pragmatic			0
they will recall one shot on target and a @entity18 that appeared almost happy in defeat			2
and they have long memories over there			0
an under - strength @entity18 were narrowly beaten at the @entity40 last week but rarely threatened @entity92 extremely disappointed with defeat			1

@entity18 were beaten by @entity16 in the @entity95 at the weekend
@entity7 had *prioritised* the *fixture* at @entity38
but dropping big names at @entity6 in the @entity29 failed
