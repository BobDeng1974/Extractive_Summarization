by @entity0 published : 17:59 est , 2 may 2012 updated : 05:37 est , 3 may 2012 @entity2 president @entity1 was told he had ' failed ' the @entity2 people in a bitter televised debate with his socialist rival @entity6			1
fighting for his political life , mr @entity1 , who trails in the polls , was reminded that he had failed to control unemployment and ' abandoned industry '			1
mr @entity6 said : ' unemployment rose by 1 million under @entity1 – four million in total			1
a record high – 10 per cent of the population			0
becoming angry , the incumbent retorted by saying : ' it 's a lie , it 's a lie [ ... ] you 're a little slanderer			0
' but despite a series of fireworks , neither candidate managed to land a knock - out blow in what observers described as a ' dramatic ' debate but which , in reality , will not affect sunday 's vote			0
you indeed failed because it doubled to 10 per cent			0
' a robust president hit back claiming there had been little social unrest while he led @entity2 for everyone			1
@entity1 , who arrived at the studio with wife @entity49 , said he objected to left - wingers likening him to a fascist like @entity53 's former dictator @entity52 or @entity54 , who led @entity2 's collaborationist @entity56 regime during @entity57 ' why not @entity58 ? ' said @entity1 , as @entity6 said he had been likened to ' all manner of zoo animals ' , without specifying which			1
turn out : @entity1 's wife @entity49 ( left ) and former presidential socialist candidate @entity63 ( right ) were present behind the scenes at the debate support : the debate ¿ broadcast on @entity2 's two main terrestrial channels and on satellite news ¿ was expected to be watched by more than half of the country 's 44.5 million voters mr @entity6 said on @entity2 - 3 television afterwards that he showed voters ' what i was capable of ' but admitted : '' i do n't think this is a debate ... that could bring out new voters			1
' the campaign has largely focused on domestic issues such as the weak economy , immigration , and integration of @entity2 muslims			1
yet the outcome is considered crucial to the rest of @entity88 as well because @entity2 is a major economic engine at a time when the eurozone is trying to climb out of a debt crisis			2
vociferous : a supporter of socialist candidate @entity6 reacts during the televised debate mr @entity1 said @entity2 needs to do more to cut spending and high state debt , while mr @entity6 backs government - funded stimulus programs			1
both have pushed for similar approaches for the rest of the continent , too			0
the two debaters quibbled over statistics ; they scoffed sarcastically or spoke over each other , pointed fingers and raised their voices			0
their debates came across at times as wonkish , esoteric or nitpicking			0
' it 's a lie ! it 's a lie ! ' mr @entity1 insisted in one heated exchange on economic policies			2
the @entity36 contender , meanwhile , forcefully denied some of mr @entity1 's claims about his intentions , insisting : ' i never said that '			2
mr @entity6 accused mr @entity1 of appointing cronies to government posts , and the president shot back , calling his rival ' a little slanderer ' and noting he had named some ministers from the political left in his first @entity126			1
a high point came as mr @entity6 teed off on a presenter 's question about what kind of president he would be			2
he tipped back in his chair , folded his arms , and launched into a litany of points starting with the phrase : ' as president of the @entity138 , i ... ' on issues like the independence of judges , his plan to defer much policy - making to the prime minister or energy policy			0
' you 've just gave us a nice speech - we got teary - eyed , ' retorted mr @entity1 , trying to break down some of mr @entity6 's points			1
' your bit about independence of judges is a joke			0
' mr @entity6 repeatedly using one of his campaign catchwords : like ' unity ' and ' change ' to stress the contrast between him and the divisive mr @entity1			1
@entity2 's @entity36 candidate for the 2012 @entity2 presidential election , @entity6 ( centre ) and his companion @entity163 arrive at the tv studios pollsters say the incumbent turned off a lot of voters early in his five - year term with his brash personal style			1
a stagnant economy made those troubles worse			0
mr @entity1 said he is being unfairly blamed for @entity2 's economic problems after years of crisis , and insisted he 's not ' the only guilty one '			1
' mr @entity1 , you would have a hard time passing for a victim , ' replied mr @entity6			1
' it 's never your fault			0
you always have a scapegoat			0
' it 's not me , it 's the crisis that hit me '			0
' mr @entity1 said mr @entity6 's economic plans would send @entity2 's debt through the roof and hurt the rest of @entity88			1
the @entity36 repeated his line that an euro - zone austerity package needs growth - minded policies , too			0
mr @entity1 stressed , again and again , mr @entity6 's inexperience , and suggested the @entity36 would not be able to handle @entity88 's debt crisis			1
' we avoided the disappearance of @entity195 , that was n't so easy			0
... i 'm not sure , mr @entity6 , that you would have done much better			2
' showman : @entity1 spoke to thousands of his supporters at @entity200 on may 1 mr @entity6 fired back : ' @entity88 is n't out of the woods			1
it is today confronted with a possible resurgence of the crisis with a generalised austerity , and i do n't want that			0
' mr @entity6 further criticised tax reforms under mr @entity1 seen by leftists as too friendly to the rich			1
mr @entity1 countered : ' saying that we offered gifts to the rich ... is slander			2
' at this , mr @entity6 laughed			2
both the @entity215 and conservatives have sought ways to lure voters who backed @entity219 , leader of the anti-immigrant @entity221 party who won a stunning 18 per cent of the first - round vote			0
mr @entity1 denounced those who compared him to @entity2 's @entity225 collaborators because of his tough campaign rhetoric on immigrants			1
' @entity228 are not a bad word , ' mr @entity1 said about his calls to limit the number of immigrants @entity2 takes in			1
mr @entity6 , meanwhile , took a similar position to mr @entity1 when it came to special treatment for @entity2 's large @entity236 community			1
he said he would not allow separate menus in public cafeterias or separate hours in swimming pools for men and women to satisfy @entity236 ' demands , and also said he would firmly support @entity2 's ban on the face - covering @entity245 veils			2
@entity247 rally : tens of thousands waved @entity2 national flags as @entity1 took to the stage on may 1 mr @entity1 took a predator pose from the outset , leaning forward on the desk through much of the debate			1
mr @entity6 frequently leaned back in his chair , raising his voice less often , and at one point even appeared to yawn			2
mr @entity1 's assertive posture , in another setting , could be seen as a good thing for a debate			2
but one of the things his critics dislike most about him is a personality seen as too aggressive , so it may not work in his favour			0
the debate – broadcast on @entity2 's two main terrestrial channels and on satellite news – was expected to be watched by more than half of the country 's 44.5 million voters			2
no fewer than 22 cameras were trained on the two politicians as they sat eight feet apart across a single table			0
both agreed on a strictly maintained studio temperature of between 19 and 20 degrees @entity281 ( 66 to @entity280 )			0
@entity1 , who cancelled all engagements on wednesday so as to be ready for the debate , insisted on chairs that could be adjusted for height			2
voilà ! @entity2 president @entity1 cast 's his vote in @entity287 in the first round of the elections while wife @entity49 looks on last week the 5ft 5ins president is extremely sensitive about his height , and has been known to stand on boxes , and even on tiptoe , in a bid to look taller			1
there was also a digital clock to show how long each candidate spoke for			0
polls have regularly portrayed him as the most unpopular president in the history of modern @entity2 , with critics attacking his brash , moneyed style			0
@entity1 awarded himself a pay rise of 140 per cent within a few days of attaining office in 2007 and then married @entity49 , the ex-supermodel and multimillionaire heiress			0
if he loses in the second round , @entity1 will become the first president since @entity308 to fail in a re-election bid			0
polls put @entity6 seven points ahead of @entity1			1
in recent days , @entity1 has been desperately trying to appeal to the far - right @entity221 vote , saying he will cut down on immigration and strengthen border controls			0
he has also warned that @entity6 's tax - and - spend plans would cause economic catastrophe			0
the latest poll by @entity318 has @entity6 winning the election by 7 percentage points , with the @entity36 ahead on 53.5 per cent to @entity1 's 46.5 per cent .			1
