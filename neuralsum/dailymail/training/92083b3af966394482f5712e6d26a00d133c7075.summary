shortly before authors wrote the final version , a @entity1 government official passed scientists a note complaining about an earlier , more moderate draft			1
@entity1 officials were last night accused of ' political interference ' in a crucial report on international climate change the official , from @entity20 ’s @entity19 , said the economic section of the report was at best an ‘ under - estimate ’ and at worst ‘ completely meaningless ’			1
the final document , published today in @entity25 , increases the predicted economic impact of global warming			1
critics said the suggestion of political interference by the @entity31 , which set out to be the ‘ greenest government ever ’ , was alarming			2
@entity34 mp @entity33 said : ‘ it is always the same with climate change			2
if the facts do n’t suit them , they change it to suit them			2
‘ a government official interfering with an independent scientific report is ridiculous			2
what you want … is what the independent scientific community thinks – not what people want them to say for their political purposes			0
’ the @entity8 report is the first comprehensive analysis in seven years of the global consequences of climate change			1
it warns that the world is ‘ ill - prepared ’ and that the effects are ‘ already occurring on all continents and across the oceans ’			0
rising temperatures , droughts and heatwaves will threaten food supplies and human health , while hundreds of millions of people will be hit by coastal flooding , it finds			1
the report , by more than 300 authors , informs policy decisions of governments around the world			0
but one of its contributors has accused the @entity8 of being too ‘ alarmist ’ – and demanded his name be withdrawn			1
professor @entity77 , an economist at the @entity78 , said the drafts had been changed to make the findings more ‘ apocalyptic ’			0
he said colleagues ‘ drifted too far to the alarmist side ’ and were likening climate change to the ‘ four horsemen of the apocalypse ’			0
his section of the report , based on 18 economic studies , predicted in early drafts that global warming of @entity91 would cut economic output by between 0.2 and 2 per cent a year – much less than previous estimates of up to 20 per cent			1
but the final @entity8 report labels his predictions ‘ incomplete estimates ’			1
it states : ‘ losses are more likely than not to be greater … than this range			0
’ @entity1 , among other nations , lobbied for this highly significant change			0
on friday , before final drafting discussions , the @entity1 government submitted a note faulting the draft			2
it said : ‘ the quoted figures of 0.2 to 2 per cent of @entity108 [ gross domestic product ] are at best an under - estimate , and at worst completely meaningless			0
’ other governments including @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 also complained			0
but @entity115 , co-chair of the @entity8 writers , last night dismissed criticism of the last - minute alteration and said the final report gave a ‘ much clearer picture ’			1
despite praising professor @entity77 as a ‘ wonderful scientist ’ , professor field of @entity124 , added : ‘ there were a couple of meaningful errors in the way @entity129 had done his analysis			0
’ mr @entity20 said : ‘ the science has spoken … this evidence builds the case for early action … we can not afford to wait			0
’ a @entity19 spokesman said climate change impacts could be ‘ catastrophic ’ , adding : ‘ these can not be underestimated and the @entity139 , as well as other countries , are seeking to make sure this is understood the world over			0
