by @entity0 a minister yesterday admitted that the plan to serve free hot meals to all young children in primary schools from september was going to fail			1
@entity6 , the @entity7 second - in - command at the @entity9 , said some schools would initially be forced to provide cold options instead of hot			1
he admitted not everything would be ‘ perfect on day one ’ as schools battle to implement @entity15 ’s flagship plan to offer four to seven - year - olds free lunches from september			1
@entity6 admitted not everything would be ' perfect on day one ' as schools battle to implement @entity15 ¿ s flagship plan to offer four to seven - year - olds free lunches from september it suggests some schools will take weeks or months , if not longer , to offer all eligible pupils hot meals			1
mr @entity6 also disclosed that extra funding to help small schools implement the policy may need to continue for ‘ years ’			1
the @entity29 disclosed this week that tens of thousands of pupils will be served reheated meals or cold sandwiches from september because schools lack proper kitchens and can not afford them			1
more than 3,000 primaries – about one in five – will buy in pre-prepared meals and either keep the lunches warm or reheat them on site in mini-kitchens			0
dozens of others will offer only cold lunches , in some cases at pupils ’ desks			2
but many of these are unlikely to meet rules on nutritional content that schools must follow			0
mr @entity54 ’s comments , in a speech to school caterers in @entity52 yesterday , represented the first time that the @entity56 had admitted the scale of the problem			0
@entity6 said that some schools would initially be forced to provide cold options instead of hot he said : ‘ some schools will provide a cold meal initially , until capital works are complete			2
in the medium term we expect all schools to be giving a hot food option – which is what is really necessary to meet the school food standards consistently			0
’ the @entity7 insisted that ‘ medium term ’ meant weeks but research for the @entity29 suggests renovation works at some schools will take considerably longer			2
mr @entity6 also said that many schools were ‘ raising their sights ’ above transporting in pre-prepared meals and wanted their own kitchens			1
he said the government intended to consider what it could do to ‘ support schools further in creating the right facilities and environment to maximise the quality of food ’			0
but he added : ‘ it would be unrealistic to think that in just one year we could rebuild the entire school estate and reverse decades of neglect in some areas			0
’ and he insisted : ‘ i was not willing to allow the search for perfection to get in the way of delivering a step change in healthy eating which is needed right now			0
’ mr @entity15 used his speech to last year ’s @entity7 conference to demand a ‘ hot , healthy lunch ’ for infant school pupils every day			1
following warnings from head teachers , references to ‘ hot ’ were quietly dropped from legislation published earlier this year , which simply requires that food be ‘ nutritious ’			0
the policy has provoked one of the fiercest bouts of in - fighting within the @entity108 since power - sharing began in 2010			0
more than 3,000 primaries - about one in five - will buy in pre-prepared meals and either keep the lunches warm or reheat them on site in mini-kitchens			2
