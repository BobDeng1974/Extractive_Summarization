only on sunday , september 28 , will we know if @entity2 captain @entity1 got his @entity4 wildcard picks right			1
he has a thankless task — but a great many in the game would support his decision to disappoint @entity9			0
trio : @entity2 captain @entity1 named @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 as his wildcards excluded : there was no place for @entity9 in @entity1 's @entity2 @entity4 team @entity19 ducks out as @entity12 makes @entity4 cut trio : @entity1 's three selections for the @entity4 , which takes place at @entity24 at the end of september a former world no 1 who has never lost a @entity4 foursomes game and forms an impressive partnership with @entity30 , @entity9 is unfortunately in horrible form right now and could only have been picked ahead of @entity12 on reputation			1
the same can be said of @entity14 and @entity13 — but @entity14 has shown glimpses of his old self of late , while @entity13 was in miserable nick in 2012 , too , yet somehow pulled it together for a superhuman effort as @entity2 won at @entity38			2
it would be awfully cruel to reject him now , so @entity9 it is			0

@entity9 *overlooked* for a @entity4 wild card by @entity1
@entity2 captain @entity1 made his three wild card selections on *tuesday*
@entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 named as wild cards
@entity4 takes place at @entity24 at the end of september
