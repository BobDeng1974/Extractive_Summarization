by @entity0 published : 10:33 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 10:47 est , 13 january 2014 the seemingly placid appearance of the sun in our skies hides its true nature as a hot fireball of plasma in constant turmoil			1
in reality a complex network , invisible to the naked eye , surrounds the solar disc , with cells of hotter and colder plasma merging and disappearing within hours of each other			2
the boundaries between these constantly moving cells are hectic places			1
powerful jets of plasma are often launched whenever the cell pattern changes			2
there was something about this bright coronal mass ejection ( cropped but un-retouched ) on 27 february 2002 that suggested the splash of colour found in a flower petal , especially when copied into a circular pattern			0
add an extreme ultraviolet image of the sun , and the artists suggests a recreation of oneness in the universe the extreme ultraviolet images come to @entity38 from the @entity40 spacecraft in black and white			1
then they are consistently colour coded for easy identification			0
for this may 1998 image , the nearly simultaneous images from three different ultraviolet imagers were each given a colour code ( red , yellow and blue ) and digitally merged into one @entity40 stands for @entity40 and is a satellite that studies the sun 24 hours a day , 365 days a year without interruptions			1
it is currently in orbit between the @entity38 and the sun. it is about 150,703,456 km ( 92 million miles ) from the sun. the spacecraft has 12 scientific instruments collecting information about the sun ranging from activity in the sun 's corona to vibrations deep in the sun 's interior			1
these changes may happen as a result of variations in the magnetic field – known as ‘ magnetic reconnection ’			0
to learn more about these reconnection jets and what causes them , scientists observe the sun at different wavelengths using a variety of techniques			0
these images , published under the title ‘ the sun as @entity82 ’ , reveal a series of scientific observations performed with the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) to understand our star			1
one image , which looks more like an abstract painting that a scientific study , shows 60 frames taken with the ultraviolet spectrometer @entity91 on @entity40 over 10 minutes			1
this image shows a coronal mass ejection ( @entity95 ) headed right towards @entity38			1
a cme is a massive burst of solar wind and magnetic fields rising above the solar corona or being released into space			0
an extreme ultraviolet image of the sun is shown here with an expanding cloud of particles heading out on all sides of the star			1
the cloud impacted @entity38 about two days later this image , which could be mistaken for a piece of abstract art , shows a series of observations performed with the @entity115 / @entity114 ( @entity40 ) to study the evolution of reconnection jets on a small patch of the sun 's surface			1
the individual frames were taken every 10 seconds , so each row of snapshots corresponds to almost three and a half minutes of observations this coronal mass ejection ( @entity95 ) from 26 november 2000 is blasting billions of tonnes of matter at millions of kilometres per hour			1
an ultraviolet image of the sun has been superimposed onto the image			2
colours have been altered , but nothing else has been added			0
the large white speckles and longer streaks are high - energy protons hitting the @entity40 imager after being blasted at nearly the speed of light by the solar storm the individual frames were taken every 10 seconds , so each row of snapshots corresponds to almost three and a half minutes of observations			1
each frame shows a spectrum of the light coming from a small patch on the solar disc : the height of each frame measures 84 000 km , which is about a sixteenth of the sun ’s diameter			2
in the first few frames of the series , the shape of the central bright region is roughly vertical , a sign that the underlying boundary was in a quiet state			0
after only a couple of minutes , however , the situation changed dramatically : towards the end of the first row and at the beginning of the second row , the shape of the bright region appears stretched towards the right			0
a pair of images taken the same day by different ultraviolet imagers are sandwiched together to make a kind of alien - shaped spacecraft			0
what appear to be shafts of light are in fact particles of the solar wind streaming out into space along open - ended magnetic field lines a particularly complex and large coronal mass ejection on 4 january 2002 made even seasoned solar physicists gasp with awe			0
the @entity182 instrument observed the particles blasting out			0
areas of white indicate the greatest intensity of matter ; the reds somewhat less ; blues , even less extreme ultraviolet images taken by the @entity40 spacecraft come back to @entity38 in black and white			1
then they are consistently colour coded for easy identification			0
one stunning image , taken in may 1998 image , shows a coronal mass ejection ( @entity95 ) headed right towards @entity38			1
a cme is a massive burst of solar wind and magnetic fields rising above the solar corona or being released into space			0
an extreme ultraviolet image of the sun is shown here with an expanding cloud of particles heading out on all sides of the star			1
the cloud impacted @entity38 about two days later			2
this image of a rainbow was created by scientists attempting to measure the sun 's interior			2
tones of oscillating sound waves from the sun produce surface change on the star around every five minutes			2
the nature and source of these oscillations was a mystery for many years after their discovery in 1962 this is a wraparound 360 degree image of solar winds in the whole sky			0
maps such as this can help scientists understand how solar winds behave at different altitudes another image shows a @entity95 blasting billions of tonnes of matter at millions of kilometres per hour			1
the large white speckles and longer streaks are high - energy protons hitting the @entity40 imager after being blasted at nearly the speed of light by the solar storm			2
a particularly complex and large coronal mass ejection on 4 january 2002 made even seasoned solar physicists gasp with awe			0
scientists observed the particles blasting out			0
areas of white in the image indicate the greatest intensity of matter ; the reds somewhat less ; blues , even less			2
this series of images , taken across nearly two decades , reveal the rapid changes in our sun in all its beauty and are now helping scientists understand what the future of our star might hold			1
the sun in extreme ultraviolet light is superimposed on a wide view of the sky around the sun. with the bright sun itself blocked , the star field beyond it comes into view			0
in this image , you can see bright plumes of solar wind and streamers emerging on both sides a close - up of the filaments in this coronal mass ejection surprised scientists by exhibiting distinct twisting as they roared away from the sun in a tightly controlled pattern			0

' the sun as @entity82 ' images reveal scientific observations taken by the @entity40
they unveil a hectic world of powerful and constantly moving plasma cells appearing on the surface of our star
one image shows the sun blasting billions of tonnes of matter towards the @entity38 at millions of kilometres per hour
another reveals dramatic changes on the sun by superimposing images of the star from three different uv *cameras*
