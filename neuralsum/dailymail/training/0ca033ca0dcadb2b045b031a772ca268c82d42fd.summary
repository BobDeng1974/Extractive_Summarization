by @entity0 published : 12:44 est , 19 february 2013 updated : 04:00 est , 20 february 2013 the electric car industry was handed a £ 37million boost by the taxpayer yesterday – even though only 2,300 were sold last year			1
transport secretary @entity4 announced a subsidy for homes and businesses which fit plug - in points for the cars			1
it will pay up to three - quarters of the installation costs , which range from £ 1,000 to £ @entity13 , police and public bodies may have the full price paid			0
the government wants to encourage the ownership of electric cars , such as the @entity20 ( pictured ) the news comes amid fears that battery - powered cars are losing their spark with drivers			0
only 3,200 have sold in the last two years – less than 1 per cent of the total market – despite green discounts of £ 5,000 per car			0
in 2012 just 2,237 electric cars were sold and registered for the ‘ plug - in car grant ’ , though that is double the figure of 1,052 in 2011 and a big increase on the 111 in 2010			1
studies show the fear of losing power on the road is a top reason people do not use the vehicles			0
mr @entity4 announced the subsidy on a visit to @entity44 , where @entity45 produces its @entity47 electric car			1
he said he wanted @entity48 to be a world leader in the electric car industry			1
@entity4 plans to give more incentive for installing an electric car charge point but he rejected criticisms that electric sales were poor because they were only of use in towns , and insisted manufacturers would not be making them if there were not a market for them : ‘ they are fantastic cars			1
’ the new multi-million pound funding package aims to kick - start home and on - street charging , as well as the creation of new charge points for people parking plug - in vehicles at railway stations , by offering subsidies covering up to 75 per cent of the cost of installing the charging points			1
hospitals , the police and other public bodies are set to have the full cost of the installation covered			0

the cash - boost follows a critical report by @entity85 watchdogs in september which said electric car sales are stalling except as ‘ subsidised second cars for the rich ’ allowing the affluent middle classes to run around town and appear environmentally - friendly			1
the mp ’s report said @entity95 grants were ‘ subsidising second cars for affluent households ’			0
it concluded that despite the £ 5,000 per car ‘ green ’ subsidy , electric vehicles have lost their spark and proved too expensive for most motorists			2
past failure by ministers to provide enough public plug - in power points also means electric car sales had fallen flat threatening an end to the government ’s electric dreams , said the report by the @entity112 transport @entity110			1
the biggest barrier to owning an electric car is the worry that there are n't enough plug points to reach your destination the @entity120 said the £ 37million funding for the package comes from the government ’s £ 400million commitment to increase the uptake of ultra-low emission or ‘ green ’ vehicles and is available until april 2015			1
installing a charge - point in a home costs about £ 1,000 - £ 1,500 , while rapid chargers can cost around £ 45,000			2
a charge - point capable of charging two vehicles at once in residential streets or train stations costs around £ 10,000			2
the full package announced today includes up to £ 13.5million for a 75per cent grant for homeowners who want domestic charge - point installed at their			2
there is also an £ 11million fund for councils in @entity141 to install on - street charging for residents who have a plug in vehicle but do not have off - street parking			2

’ @entity169 , @entity45 ’s senior vice president for manufacturing , said : ‘ we are delighted that the @entity48 @entity95 is showing it shares our commitment to the transport of the future			0
