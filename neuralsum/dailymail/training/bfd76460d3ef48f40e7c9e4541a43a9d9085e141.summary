by @entity0 published : 07:42 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 11:32 est , 1 october 2013 an @entity3 volcano is thought be the source of a massive ‘ mystery eruption ’ - the largest that has occurred in the last 3,700 years			1
the enormous blast , which took place nearly 800 years ago , may have created a ‘ @entity9 of the @entity10 ’ , according to researchers			1
they believe this mystery city may lie buried waiting to be discovered on an @entity3 island			1
the source of the eruption has been narrowed down to the @entity18 volcano on @entity3 's @entity19			1
its location is shown in the bottom image			0
today , all that remains is a large crater lake researchers claim the volcano could also be one that started a 600 - year cold period named ‘ the @entity29 ’			2
a team , led by @entity31 of the @entity32 , has dated the blast to between may and october of 1257			0
the source of the eruption has also been narrowed down to the @entity18 volcano on @entity3 's @entity19			1
today , all that remains is a large crater lake			0
‘ at the local and regional scales , the socio - economic and environmental consequences of this cataclysmic event must have been dramatic , ’ said the report , in the @entity39			0
researchers believe the volcano could also be one that started a 600 - year cold period named the @entity29 this map shows the large presence of pumice - a very light and porous volcanic rock - of up to 50 mm at 46 - km distance southeast from the vent on @entity52			1
scientists claim this shows the huge magnitude of the @entity57 eruption the eruption was eight times as large as the @entity61 explosion which occurred in 1883 and twice as large as @entity62 in 1815			2
the blast was so large that it left its mark in the ice of both the @entity66 and the @entity67			1
to narrow down the source of the explosion , the research team analysed volcanic ejecta chemistry , stratigraphic data , historical writings and radiocarbon - dating results			0
professor @entity31 said that while the eruption was known by many different researchers , the main problem up until now was they had all been working separately			0
this map shows the distribution of pyroclastic density currents ( @entity80 ) from the @entity57 eruption and location of charcoal samples used for radiocarbon dating			2
the enormous blast , which took place nearly 800 years ago , may have created a ' @entity9 of the @entity10 ' , according to researchers ‘ the tropical location , the size of its caldera , the timing of the eruption , its magnitude , and the match between the geochemical composition of @entity18 ash with glass shards found in ice cores from @entity99 and @entity67 , ’ wrote the researchers			1
the team believe the volcano blasted 10 cubic miles of debris up to 27 miles high into the sky			0
the fallout settled around the world			0
near the volcano itself , it settled into thick deposits that the researchers sampled in over 130 places			0
further afield , the volcanic sulphate became locked in ice core samples taken from both @entity99 and @entity67			2
tree rings with abnormal growth rates , and historical records from as far as @entity118 , showed how the eruption disturbed the climate for at least two years			1
field observations on the pyroclastic fall layers from the @entity123 show the maximum thickness measured exceeds 1 m , and cumulative fall deposit reaches up to 1.60m meanwhile , medieval texts describe unusual cold and wet weather the following summer in 1258			0
researchers believe that the @entity18 volcano had a role in triggering the @entity29			1
in a 2012 study , scientists used climate models to show that a series of eruptions may have triggered the onset of the @entity29			0
although the precise timing varies somewhat , this period is typically considered to have occurred between 1250 and 1850			0
' a single eruption could not have caused such long - term climate change , ' @entity139 , a geoscientist at @entity140 told @entity143			2
' instead , it had to be a sequence of large eruptions , one of which might be the @entity18 volcano			1

eruption thought to be from @entity18 volcano on @entity3 's @entity19
blast was so large that it left its mark in ice of the @entity66 and the @entity67
historical evidence shows how it disturbed the climate for at least two years
mystery city , *preserved* in same way as @entity9 , may be buried on the island
