@entity0 recently admitted to telling @entity1 that it was a matter of getting over the ‘ @entity4 hump ’ but @entity6 ’s chief executive might well have cited a couple of names that had met their grim fates closer to home			1
one thing is for sure : @entity1 did not need to be an ardent student of the history of @entity16 football to appreciate the gravitas of the situation he had become immersed in earlier this season			1
by late autumn , his side had twice exited @entity21 while @entity22 had left @entity23 triumphant			1
a search party was hardly required to identify his doubters			1
@entity6 manager @entity1 admitted that the first six months in charge were mentally tough publicly , @entity1 plastered on the brave face and talked of looking behind the results for progress			1
privately , the misgivings about his long - term suitability for the post were beginning to gnaw at him			1
‘ we played @entity34 away ( 1 - 1 ) and we could n’t play worse than we did , ’ @entity1 recalled			1
‘ it was unbelievably bad			1
you know what the players want but you just have n’t got the message across			1
‘ people are insecure and that ’s a hard time for the coach and the players			1
’ even for a manager who had been steeped in the nuances of @entity16 football , such a period would have been troubling enough			1
@entity1 , a @entity48 who had cut his teeth at tiny @entity51 , began to look like a man caught in entirely the wrong movie			1
‘ i have to admit the first six months were tough mentally because you have to really learn a lot of new things and get settled , ’ he went on			2
‘ one thing is the language , the culture is another and then you have to know new opponents , your own team , understand what @entity6 is all about and @entity16 football			1
‘ there are so many things to take in and it ’s so easy to push too hard and then you do n’t get any time for reflection and you just get tired and then you can meet hard games and hard periods			2
you have nothing to push against			2
’ the @entity48 was unsure whether he was cut out to be the boss of the @entity73 upon his unveiling last summer , @entity1 was asked if he felt ready to manage a club like @entity6			1
he could hardly have answered in anything other than the affirmative			2
however , faced with a dressing room full of strangers , a league and a country he knew little about and the small matter of @entity84 qualifiers hurtling towards him , he quickly appreciated the scale of the task he faced			2
‘ i spoke @entity87 at once , ’ he recalled			2
‘ i ’d a one - hour speech to them ( the players ) about how i wanted things			2
i think that went quite well			2
‘ but i did n’t know anything about @entity16 football			2
i did n’t know anything about the players			2
i ’d had a full season with my old club and five days later i was ready for @entity6			1
‘ i did n’t know more than four names in the squad so it takes time to get to know them then bang , you ’re in the @entity84 and playing games all over @entity21 , so i was in a situation i had to manage			2
‘ the players really wanted it			2
but my way of playing is quite difficult , it ’s a lot of things			0
it ’s not straightforward , a lot of relations and rules that we have to get into the players			0
‘ that takes time to get into			0
it ’s so important to understand if you go back to the big managers they had before , @entity113 ( @entity114 ) and ( @entity116 ) @entity115 and @entity117 ( @entity118 ) , they also struggled in the beginning			1
it was n’t only me			0
@entity0 was saying that the whole time - relax , you ’re not the first , we ’ve been through this before			0
but it ’s harder for a @entity48 guy coming in , who ’s unknown , as opposed to someone coming in with a big name			0
’ he was not alone in those difficult days , however			0
realising the need to have individuals familiar with the club ’s dna standing beside him , @entity132 was suggested as an assistant			0
@entity138 , the goalkeeping coach under @entity114 , was retained while @entity139 , the former youth coach , was promoted			0
collectively , they acted as @entity1 ’s support network			1
‘ i had unbelievably good back up from @entity0 , @entity132 , @entity139 and @entity138 as well , ’ @entity1 explained			1
but results have picked up and they lead the @entity143 ( @entity144 pictured scoring at @entity145 ) ‘ i ’m a very open person , i say it as it is and i do that with them as well			1
my staff has been very good and helped me a lot			0
we ’re growing more together , i ’ve learned from them , they ’ve learned from me and hopefully we know where we want to go			0
that ’s fun and that gives you energy			0
that ’s why i love to be here			0
’ it ’s the small things that are making his life a little easier			0
in the 10 months he has been in @entity16 , language has become less of an issue			0
‘ the first three weeks , trying to listen to what people were saying for five hours ... when i got home , i was totally gone , ’ he admitted			0
‘ i was so tired because i was sitting there all the time thinking “ what is he really saying ? ”			0
there were so many new things			0
‘ @entity174 is one of the hardest			0
half the time i just try to laugh at the right moments ! but i am getting to understand more			0
a blip against @entity179 aside , @entity6 have been imperious since the turn of the year ‘ now i feel more comfortable with the vocabulary , i feel i can express myself better			1
before it was always the same words i was using			0
but i ’m looking forward to speaking like every @entity184 ! ’ ahead of wednesday 's game with @entity186 , @entity1 , his players and the supporters are very much now on the same page			1
a blip against @entity179 aside , @entity6 have been imperious since the turn of the year			1
from privately wondering if he ’d bitten off more than he could chew by coming to @entity6 , @entity1 is now ravenous for more success			1
‘ it ’s fun , ’ he said			0
‘ i want to win more trophies			1
i ’ve managed now to enjoy the week better in the past when everything in management was new and stressful			0
‘ mentally , i ’m in a very good place which is why i ’m saying i ’m enjoying the moments right now and looking forward to the games			0
‘ we have built the foundation and now the fun part is starting - to build relationships into the team and get the systems even better and quicker			0

@entity6 boss @entity1 was unsure he was cut out for the job
@entity1 struggled for results *initially* at @entity23
but the @entity211 now lead the @entity143 and should win the title
