thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes in @entity2 as experts today tried to defuse a 550lb @entity5 bomb dropped on the city during @entity7			1
the undetonated explosive was found beneath ground at the site of the former @entity12 nightclub , a hangout of the @entity14 in the 1970s			0
bomb disposal teams fear its complex chemical fuse could trigger a repeat of the 2010 tragedy when three experts were killed in a blast in another @entity22 city			1
i am not defusing that - i ’m not suicidal			0
' so , rather than defusing the bomb , experts plan to surround it with sand and carry out a controlled explosion as the site			2
2.8million tons weight of all @entity29 and @entity30 bombs dropped on @entity22 ( 54 % @entity42 ) 75,000 tons weight of @entity44 bombs dropped on @entity30 543,000 @entity22 lost their lives in @entity7 air raids 60,000 @entity30 killed by @entity22 bombs 390,000 sorties flown by @entity50 bombers 2,500 unexploded bombs yet to be found in @entity2 , according to experts 5 % the proportion of bombs that failed to detonate a large timber shell was today built around the bomb , which is believed to have been dropped in 1944 or 1945 by either @entity30 or @entity29 forces			1
the controlled explosion is likely to take place tomorrow morning			0
only then will the 2,500 people living within a 1,000 - yard radius of the site in the @entity64 area close to the city centre			1
a nearby subway station has also been closed as well as parts of @entity68 , one of @entity2 ’s busiest streets			2
it is unknown whether @entity29 or @entity30 planes dropped the bomb , which was discovered as diggers tore a building down			1
both countries used the same type of 550lb explosives and rust is understood to have obscured any identifying marks			0
during the war @entity50 and @entity42 are estimated to have dropped around 50,000 bombs on @entity2			2
city officials believe that 2,500 unexploded payloads – around 5 per cent of the total dropped - are still buried in the @entity86 capital			2
precaution : the bomb , which cannopt be defused , is covered with sand bags ahead of a planned controlled blast @entity90 : a @entity22 police officer guards a section of @entity68 , which has been sealed off along with a a 1,000 - yard radius area			1
a total of 2,500 people have been evacuated and they pose a huge problem in all of @entity22 , where barely a week goes by without a new discovery			1
it is unusual , however , to find a bomb in such a densely populated areas as most undetonated explosives tend to be uncovered outside big urban zones			1
allies dropped of 2.8million tons during @entity7 , massively eclipsing the 75,000 tons unleashed by the @entity44 on @entity30			0
by the war ’s end , the @entity42 had dropped 1.5million tons of bombs on the country and the @entity50 1.3million tons			0
@entity30 bombers alone flew a total of 390,000 sorties			0
locked out : evacutated people in an aid station in @entity2 , where they will have to stay until wednesday round - up : @entity22 police officers evacuating apartment buildings after the bomb was found sealed off : recovery vehicles parked on @entity68 , which has been blocked to traffic as a result , few towns escaped extensive damage from air raids and , by 1945 , 543,000 civilians had been killed by the allied assault , compared with 60,000 in @entity30			1
the worst air raid occurred in @entity128 when , over two days , at least 30,000 civilians were killed in attacks by the @entity50 and the @entity42			0
last week a similar 550lb bomb was found in @entity132 and experts fear that the dud payloads are becoming more dangerous due to ‘ material fatigue ’			0
already 67 years have passed since @entity22 ’s defeat and over time the safety elements in the trigger mechanisms are increasingly wearing away			0
it means that some bombs could explode before being discovered and others will be more difficult to defuse			0
in the most deadly incident in recent years , three bomb disposal experts were blown to bits in june 2010 as they attempted to defuse an @entity29 bomb in the northern university city of @entity147			1
video : spectacular ! bomb is detonated in @entity2			2

2,500 people living within 1,000 yards of the explosive ordered to evacuate
unknown whether bomb is @entity29 or @entity30 as both forces used payload
fears complex fuse may trigger repeat of 2010 blast that killed three experts
unexploded bomb is one of 2,500 estimated to be buried in @entity2
unusual to find bomb in such an *heavily* populated area
