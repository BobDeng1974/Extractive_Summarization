with its genius construction , the @entity5 promises to allow night cuddling without risking a dreaded dead arm			2
it comprises a single foam block central portion for the body , and ten slats at the top and ten at the bottom , allowing for arms and feet to dip in			1
the @entity5 features clever foam slats allowing for cuddling arms to slide in comfortably the three - inch wide slats part easily from one another , leaving room to slide an arm beneath a partner and leave it there			1
the @entity23 could strengthen relationships , says its designer , by letting partners remain cuddled together			1
because their body is supported by the slats on each side of the encircling arm , it should not get squashed , however long it is left there			2
the mattress designer says a similar arrangement at the foot of the bed means anyone who is able to tear themselves away from their partner for the night can sleep face - down with their toes pointing down into the mattress and snug between the slats			2
dead arms need not be an issue with this genius concept by award - winning designer @entity51 the man behind the mattress is award - winning designer @entity51			1
he says that although it is a very technical design , it also has a power for emotional - and psychological - good			2
mr @entity51 , an @entity56 , writes : ' embracing is a magical human behaviour , and one that distinguishes us from other animals			1
' a loving embrace , especially between partners , is one of the most calming actions			1
embracing , and bodily proximity and connection after love - making , are very important for strengthening relationships , ' mr @entity51 claims			1
' however , what usually stops this pleasant state is not mental tiredness , it is physical weakness			0
