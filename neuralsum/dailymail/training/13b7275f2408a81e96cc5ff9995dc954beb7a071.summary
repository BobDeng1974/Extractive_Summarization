it is the moment many young children dream about - waking up on christmas morning to find a bulging stocking full of treats hanging on their bedpost			0
but this year some youngsters may find one traditional bag of goodies missing , as @entity7 has announced they will no longer be making their beloved sacks of chocolate coins			1
the company dropped the bombshell on @entity12 today , replying to a consumer enquiry with : ' chocolate coins have been discontinued however we have lots of other chocolatey treats to try '			1
one user , @entity32 , posted the dramatic message : ' noooooooooooo this is a horrendous decision and @ @entity34 must reconsider			0
' another , @entity35 , worte : ' how do i explain that to the 5yo and 3yo who adore them ? # wrongmove			0
' an online petition has also been launched to reverse the confectionery companys move to stop selling the 59 gram sacks			1
treats : chocolate coins have become a traditional @entity25 stocking item chocolate coins have long been a @entity25 treat and the tradition is thought to have stemmed from @entity48 secretly giving his money away to children in his native @entity52			1
the figure , a 4th centruy bishop we now call @entity56 , was shy so he decided to drop his purse down a chimney			0
it landed in a pair of stockings a little girl had hung up to dry and the tradition was born			1
@entity7 , established in @entity64 in 1824 , was bought by @entity66 company @entity65 for £ 11.5 billion in 2010			0
the acquisition faced widespread disapproval from the @entity70 public - dismayed at the prospect of an iconic @entity70 institution falling into @entity66 hands			0
last year @entity65 split into two companies , with the confectionery business taking the name of @entity77 , of which @entity7 is now a subsidiary			1
explaining their decision , a spokesman told @entity80 that wrapping foil around the coin - shaped chocolates was ' fiddly ' work			2
they suggested the coins were not as profitable as other products because they could not market them in the ' @entity7 purple '			2
the chocolate maker also believes shoppers have switched to cheaper , own - brand versions sold at supermarkets such as @entity94 and @entity95 causing its own sales to decline			2
' we are sorry to see the coins go , but that 's business , ' the spokesman added .			0
