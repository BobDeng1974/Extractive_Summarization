by @entity0 published : 03:14 est , 15 november 2013 @entity2 : 05:34 est , 15 november 2013 thousands of women and girls have undergone procedures for ' designer vaginas ' in the past five years because internet porn is distorting perceptions of what is normal , doctors have warned			1
in the past decade , cases of genital cosmetic surgery have risen five-fold and more than 2,000 women are now having the procedure on the @entity15 each year			1
over the past five years more than 250 such procedures were performed on girls under the age of 14 , @entity15 figures show			1
thousands of women and girls have undergone procedures for ' designer vaginas ' in the past five years because internet porn is distorting perceptions of what is normal , doctors warned ( picture posed by model ) but experts warned this was merely the ' tip of the iceberg ' since private cosmetic surgeons are not required to contribute records for official figures			1
the @entity34 ( @entity34 ) today proposed restrictions on the procedures in both @entity15 and private clinics			1
the most common kind of female cosmetic surgery is labiaplasty , in which the size of the patient 's labia minora is reduced			2
this can be done on legitimate medical grounds , as a treatment for women with concerns about hygiene , difficulties during sex , or discomfort duing exercise			2
but @entity54 , chairman of the @entity34 's ethics committee , said the recent rise in cases had been ' fuelled in part by the mass media and inaccurate advertising '			0
' some women are requesting it solely for cosmetic reasons and these decisions are not always being made on an informed understanding of the normal variations that exist , but influenced by images from popular culture and the pornography industry , ' she said			2
' we need to inform women that everyone is unique and that variation in appearance is normal in the vast majority of cases			2
' @entity76 , a philosopher who also sits on ethics committee , added : ' the misapprehension arises from the prominence of just one type of " neat " genital appearance , the type to be found prominently depicted in pornography			1
' but complications from the surgery are common , with ruptures reported in a third of cases and @entity15 doctors reporting seeing women who have suffered complications caused by private - sector surgery			1
there is also a lack of research into the long - term risks posed by labiaplasty , the report warns			0
some women who have undergone the procedure can suffer damage to sexual function and discomfort when wearing tight clothes			0
in the short term , risks can include bleeding and wound infection			0
@entity108 : complications from the surgery are common , with ruptures reported in a third of cases and @entity15 doctors reporting seeing women who have suffered complications caused by private - sector surgery the @entity34 's ethics committee warned that teenage girls could be undergoing unnecessary surgery that is anatomically not much different from female genital mutilation			1
according to @entity15 figures cited by the @entity122 ( @entity123 ) , 266 girls under the age of 14 had genital surgery between 2008 and 2012 , which was carried out ' for unknown reasons and with unknown consequences '			1
the society warned that undergoing labiaplasty surgery before puberty is complete can lead to long - term problems			0
' the younger a girl begins her labiaplasty trajectory , the higher the number of operations over her lifetime and the greater the risk of scarring and sensitivity loss , ' the report said			2
instead teenage girls should be told ' unambiguously ' when they have normal genitals ; those showing signs of psychological problems related to their body image should be directed to paediatric psychologists , it says			0
experts also said that surgery should not be conducted on the @entity15 unless it is a medical requirement and that private surgeons should give women information on the normal range of genital appearance			1
consultant plastic surgeon @entity155 , from the @entity156 , said he welcomed the new guidelines			0
but he told the @entity158 that clinicians should be sensitive to potential problems			0
' an asymmetrical labia can lead to functional problems as well as aesthetic problems			0
over 50 per cent of my patients see me due to functional reasons , ' he said			0
' only a small proportion are there for purely aesthetic reasons			0
' however , he did concede that he had seen the number of patients requesting the procedure soar in recent years .			2

number of labiaplasty procedures on @entity15 have risen five-fold in past decade
in the past five years more than 250 girls under 14 have had it done
experts warn women are influenced by ' neat ' genital appearance in porn
