gone are the days of flight attendants in miniskirts , but sexism in still alive and well in the the airline industry - as evidenced by a note a passenger left to his female pilot on a flight this weekend in @entity8			1
@entity10 pilot @entity9 had just wrapped up a flight from @entity12 to @entity13 when cleaning crews brought her a note , written on a napkin , left behind by one of the passengers			1
the note , written by a ' @entity20 ' and left at seat 12 e , tells @entity22 that ' the cockpit of an airliner is no place for a woman			1
a woman 's place : a passenger named ' @entity20 ' left behind this sexist note aimed at female @entity10 pilot @entity9 after a flight this weekend in @entity8 sexist : in the note , @entity20 said that a woman 's greatest honor is being a mother and that they are short moms and not pilots ' a woman being a mother is the most honor , not as " captain "			1
we 're short mothers , not pilots @entity10 , ' the note continues			2
' ps i wish @entity10 could tell me a fair lady is at the helm so i could book another flight ! in the end this is all mere vanity			2
' the note is signed ' respectfully in love , @entity20 '			1
@entity9 , a mother of two , told @entity55 that she is used to passengers being surprised that they have a female captain , but she has never been the target of such blatant sexism			2
her male co-pilot and the female flight attendants were equally shocked by the message			2
' we did n't know what to say , ' she said			0
not ok : mother of two , and a pilot for 17 years , @entity9 shot back at the sexist passenger by posting pictures of the note on her @entity70 but eventually @entity9 decided to make a stand , and posted the pictures of the note on @entity70 to make a point that what the passenger wrote was not ok			1
' i have heard many comments from people throughout my 17 - year career as a pilot			0
your note is , without a doubt , the funniest			0
it was a joke , right ? right ? ? i thought , not			0
' you were more than welcome to deplane when you heard i was a " fair lady "			0
funny , we all , us humans , have the same rights in this great free country of ours			0
' the airline also issued a statement , saying : ' we are enormously proud of the professionalism , skills and expertise of our pilots and we were disappointed to see this note			0
' biggest hope : @entity9 says she hopes the incident will inspire more women to enroll in flight schools to become pilots spokesman @entity106 would n't speak further , saying ' to do so only serves to lend credibility to the note , which it does n't deserve			1
' since posting the pictures on @entity70 , @entity9 says she 's received an overwhelming amount of supportive comments			2
' i have to think that â€™s very much an uncommon opinion among the general public , ' she said			0
she hopes some good will come of the incident , and inspire more women to enroll in flight schools to become pilots themselves			1
' i just hope that that mindset can change , like it has in a lot of professions , ' she said .			0
