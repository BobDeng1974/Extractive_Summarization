the tournament is being held in the @entity11 and @entity12 where there is a particular danger of the potentially fatal viral disease @entity16 ( @entity16 ) experts warn			1
warning : ticks infected with encephalitis target the warmest parts of the body one of the worst affected regions is @entity23 , which contains @entity24 - the base for the @entity3 team			1
fans most at risk are those who will be camping in the countryside as thousands are intending to do in order to avoid paying the spiralling hotel charges in cities			2
ticks infected with the disease thrive in such areas and they often bite the warmest parts of the body which doctors say are the groin or the armpit			1
this means nipping behind a tree in the countryside for a call of nature could be exposing themselves to the risk of a bite			2
the warning comes from @entity49 charity @entity48 which has set up a special page on its website @entity52 dedicated to football supporters heading to the event			2
it lists the level of risk in the regions where many of the games are being played and shows that part of @entity61 is described as ‘ highly endemic ’			2
up to 13,000 people a year in @entity61 need hospital treatment for an infected tick bite , a third of whom go on to contract meningitis			0
this , in turn , leads to encephalitis , a swelling of the brain and spinal cord			1
only two per cent of cases end fatally yet those who recover can suffer for years from symptoms such as exhaustion and loss of memory , said @entity48			0
fans : football fans who will be camping ahead of the @entity3 matches in @entity12 have been told to take particular care a spokesman said : ' our message to travelling fans is " watch your tackle "			0
' ticks lie in wait and crawl unnoticed to a nice warm spot on your body , usually the groin although the armpit is another favourite feeding place			0
' underwear offers little protection against these blood - sucking pests			0
' people spending time in the countryside , especially if they are sleeping or walking a lot in grassy areas and undergrowth , need to regularly check their body for ticks			0
' remove any immediately as the moment the tick bites there is the risk you will contract @entity16			1
' the @entity111 has warned travellers going to @entity16 - endemic countries seek medical advice from the local clinic before they go			1
among countries affected are almost all in central and eastern @entity61 but also those in @entity117 and as far south as @entity118			0
infected ticks are found in rural and forest areas from late spring and throughout the summer .			0
