the new service , called @entity7 , will initially provide same - day delivery of food and other products bought online by a small group of consumers in @entity13 and suburbs located south of the city			1
the delivery service is part of @entity1 's effort to increase consumer reliance on the @entity20 , so it will have more opportunities to show online ads , which generate most of its revenue			2
special delivery : @entity1 is testing a grocery delivery service , called @entity7 that will initially provide same - day delivery of food and other products bought online by a small group of consumers in @entity13 the company , based in @entity31 , @entity32 , did n't say how many people will be part of the @entity35 the pilot program goes well , @entity1 plans to expand delivery service to other markets			1
' we hope this will help users explore the benefits of a local , same - day delivery service , and help us kick the tires on the new service , ' @entity1 said in a thursday statement			1
@entity1 has learned that the more time people spend online , the more likely they are to use its dominant search engine or one of its other popular services , like its @entity50 video site or @entity51 , that include advertising			2
the delivery service also could spur merchants to buy more online ads if @entity1 's same - day delivery service encourages consumers to do more of their shopping online			1
having to wait days or , in some cases , more than a week for the delivery of online orders ranks among the biggest drawbacks to internet shopping			0
it 's a problem that @entity65 and @entity66 , which operate the largest e-commerce sites , already have been trying to solve by offering same - day service in some @entity70 markets			1
further expansion : if the pilot program goes well , @entity1 plans to expand delivery service to other markets @entity75 , the world 's largest retailer , also offers same - day delivery in five markets			1

it remains unclear whether internet shopping and same - day delivery can be profitable			1
online grocer @entity103 collapsed in 2001 , largely because it could n't devise a pricing plan that would pay for the costs of same - day delivery without alienating shoppers unwilling to pay too much extra for the added convenience			2
@entity1 is still trying to figure out how much to charge for its same - day delivery service			2
competition : @entity1 is trying to lure more customers who expect same - day delivery from rivals like @entity66 and @entity65 for the six - month test period in the @entity13 area , consumers wo n't have to pay a surcharge			1
@entity1 instead will receive a commission from participating merchants			0
the expansion into same - day delivery comes at the same time that @entity1 is preparing to close some of its older online services so it can devote more attention and money to other projects			2
the realignment has irked some @entity1 users			0
the biggest complaints have centered on @entity129 , which allows people to automatically receive headlines and links from their favorite sites , and @entity134 , which allows web surfers to design a page consisting of the @entity137 surrounded set up other online features , such as local weather reports and stock market quotes			0
@entity129 is scheduled to close in july and @entity134 will shut down in november			0
