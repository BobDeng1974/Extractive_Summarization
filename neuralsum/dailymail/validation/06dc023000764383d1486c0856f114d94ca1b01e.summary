a woman who fled with her son while fighting to prevent his circumcision will face imprisonment if she does n't return and allow the surgery to proceed , a judge ruled friday			1
in a stinging rebuke of the mother , @entity8 , circuit judge @entity6 said she had successfully dragged out a legal battle and was ' reprehensible ' for going missing with the boy and for conduct that has put the 4 - year - old in a public spotlight ' making him an object of curiosity and worse '			1
he found her in contempt and demanded she appear in court on tuesday with the child or he would command police to find her			2
circuit judge @entity6 said on friday that @entity8 could escape jail if she appears before him on tuesday with the child she will only avoid jail on the contempt charge , @entity6 said , if she signs paperwork necessary to schedule the procedure that she initially agreed to in a legal document			1
' this child has been placed in a light that provides much too much scrutiny for a little boy , ' the judge said			2
' i blame no one but the mother for that			0
' it was the latest dramatic turn in a case nearly as old as the boy himself , and one that has become a rallying cry for ' intactivists , ' the circumcision opponents who say removing the foreskin is barbaric			2
though @entity8 gave her blessing to circumcision in the parenting plan she reached with the boy 's father , @entity49 of @entity51 , she later changed her mind , leading to a long court battle			1
@entity54 and appellate judges have sided with the father			0
the father has called circumcision ' just the normal thing to do			1
' the mother said it 's not worth the risks			2

both @entity70 and the boy 's doctors have received death threats			1
meantime , the mother has stoked the protests and publicity , despite a court order not to , said @entity78 , an attorney for the father , who appeared in court			0
' she 's willing to flee with him and plaster him all over the @entity81 and do anything she can , ' @entity49 said			2
' she 's stated that she 's going to do everything that she can to stop it			0
' @entity49 said he has not seen his son since feb. 19			1
@entity86 , the attorney for @entity63 , said he did not know where his client was			0
after the hearing , @entity86 said ' we 're concerned for the child 's wellbeing and emotional condition			0
' though circumcision rates have fallen in the @entity94 , a majority of boys still undergo the procedure , though a bubbling movement against it has developed			0
the @entity100 says medical evidence shows benefits clearly outweigh risks , and that circumcision can lower a male 's risk of sexually transmitted diseases , penile cancer and urinary tract infections			0
