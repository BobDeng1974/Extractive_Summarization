@entity1 can not go on as a ' bloated , high - taxing , welfare - heavy nation ' , @entity0 warned today as he set out the ' moral case ' for tax cuts			1
the prime minister said it was ' morally wrong ' for the government to spend money ' as if it grows on trees '			1
he said major changes to the tax system introduced by the coalition and promised by the @entity13 will mean the average worker get a £ 3,800 income tax cut between 2015 and 2020			1
he argued that it was better to ‘ incentivise work ’ instead of allowing people to languish on welfare , and improved people ’s living standards			1
the @entity13 have put two major tax cuts at the heart of their bid for re-election			1
at the @entity34 conference earlier this month , mr @entity0 promised that no - one earning the minimum wage - equivalent to £ 12,500 - a - year - would pay any income tax at all , he said , giving a tax cut to 30million people			2
he also announced the point at which the 40p tax rate is levied would rise from around £ 42,000 to £ 50,000 - a huge boost for middle class families			2
the two commitments , which he later pledged to start implementing straight away even before the deficit is due to be eliminated , will cost £ 7.2bn a year which is as yet unfunded			2
it prompted speculation that departments such as schools , defence and local government could be asked to take major budget cuts if the @entity13 win the next election			1
in an article justifying the move today , the prime minister said cutting taxes was at the heart of his pitch for the next election and drew a ‘ stark choice ’ between the conservatives and @entity63			1
‘ nowhere is the contrast more stark than on taxation ’ , he wrote in @entity64			0
‘ @entity63 wants to put up taxes on people ’s homes , jobs , pensions — even their deaths			1
' conservatives are committed to cutting your taxes			1
we know the economic case for cutting taxes : in a competitive world we can not afford to carry on as a bloated , high - taxing , welfare - heavy nation			1
‘ we have to direct our resources to incentivising work through tax cuts and not incentivising welfare through extra benefit entitlements			1
‘ we have to fight the notion that you can endlessly suck more taxes out of businesses and bite the hand that feeds … for me , the simplest way to help with living standards is this : allow people to take home more of their own money			1
’ in mr @entity0 ’s first comment on how these tax cuts would be funded , he said they would be ‘ hard but doable ’			1
@entity34 tax cut promises prompted speculation that departments such as schools , defence and local government could be asked to take major budget cuts @entity108 has already announced the next government would have to make £ 25bn worth of savings , starting with a new squeeze on welfare for those aged under 21			1
he went on to say that apart from the economic case there was also a ‘ moral case ’			0
he wrote : ‘ it is morally right that the rich pay their fair share in tax ; and right that those who are able to contribute to our public services and safety nets do so			0
but what is morally wrong is government spending money as if it grows on trees			0
‘ every single pound of public money started as private earning … a huge amount of hard work : early morning alarms , long commutes , hours spent on the factory floor , the office , the hospital ward or the classroom			2
‘ on the other side of the coin are those who work hard , many on low incomes , who would desperately like to spend more money on their family			2
’ the article suggests mr @entity0 will try and see off the threat from @entity148 with an attractive economic pitch – offering tax cuts to those struggling on low incomes			2
but @entity63 ’s @entity152 the shadow chief secretary to the treasury , said the promises were not borne out by mr @entity0 ’s actions			0
‘ while millionaires have been given a huge tax cut , ordinary working people are paying more because he raised vat and cut tax credits ’ , mr @entity152 said			0
‘ independent figures from the @entity162 show that by next year families will be £ 974 a year worse off because of tax and benefit changes since 2010			0
and @entity0 still wo n’t rule out raising @entity159 again on families and pensioners to pay for £ 7 billion of unfunded tax promises			0
’ @entity152 mp , @entity63 ’s shadow chief secretary to the treasury , responding to @entity0 ’s article in @entity64 , said : ‘ @entity0 will be judged on his actions , not his words			0
he ’s raised taxes 24 times			2
while millionaires have been given a huge tax cut , ordinary working people are paying more because he raised vat and cut tax credits			0
‘ independent figures from the @entity162 show that by next year families will be £ 974 a year worse off because of tax and benefit changes since 2010			0
and @entity0 still wo n’t rule out raising vat again on families and pen - sioners to pay for £ 7 billion of unfunded tax promises			0
‘ @entity63 ’s economic plan will introduce a lower 10p starting rate of tax for 24 million people on middle and low incomes and cut business rates for small firms			0
‘ we will tackle tax avoidance and introduce a mansion tax to invest in our @entity195			0
and to balance the books in a fairer way we ’ll reverse @entity0 ’s £ 3 billion tax cut for the top one per cent of earners			0

prime minister claimed reducing taxes helped to ' incentivise work '
schools and defence could be asked to take budget cuts if the @entity13 win
