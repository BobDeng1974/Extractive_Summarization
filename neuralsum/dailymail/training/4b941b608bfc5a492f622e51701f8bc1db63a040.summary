@entity1 spending on the internet in december rose by much less than expected amid the delivery chaos caused by @entity4			1
annual spending in the month rose by just five per cent , which was the lowest increase over the festive period since internet shopping took off a decade ago			1
despite the disappointing numbers , total retail spending on the web reached a new high of £ 104billion in 2014 , which is the first time it has topped £ 100bn			1
the poor figures for the month are thought to have been a result of @entity4 , an event imported from the @entity24 ( above a shopper in @entity26 on @entity4 ) the poor figures for december are thought to have been caused by @entity4 , which fell at the end of november and brought forward a lot of present shopping			1
the event , which has been imported from the @entity24 where it kicks off the festive shopping season , was presented by retailers as a huge success however they are now having second thoughts			1
for while there was a huge spike in spending , these sales were made on the back of big price cuts which will hit profits			0
at the same time , it seems the event only brought forward gift purchases that would have otherwise have taken place in december , rather than increasing overall sales			0
most important of all was the level of orders that a huge number of household name stores could not cope			0
@entity50 customers were told they had to wait of 10 days to get their purchases , while the online fashion chain @entity52 suspended a large part of its their next day delivery system			0
@entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , boots and a host of other household name retailers faced similar problems			0
at the same time the courier company @entity62 , which works with more than 80per cent of web stores , went into meltdown because it did not have enough couriers to ensure items arrived when promised			2
such was the crisis that it suspended taking new parcels into its system for two days to clear a backlog of gifts			0
with the level of orders on @entity4 , a huge number of household name stores could not cope such as @entity50 , whose customers were told they had to wait of 10 days to get their purchases the net effect of the chaos was that people were put off shopping online for gifts in december and many opted to ‘ click and collect ’ rather than gamble on items being delivered			1
the sales figures were published by the web retailer trade body , @entity83 , spending experts @entity84 and the business consultants @entity87			2
they said spending in november and december combined was some 13per cent ahead of 2013			2
their study confirmed separate research by the @entity93 and accountants , @entity95 , which also highlighted problems created by @entity4			2
@entity97 , the @entity98 at @entity95 , said : ‘ the parcel backlogs caused by the aftermath of @entity4 forced some retailers to renege on their delivery guarantees and this impacted shoppers ’ confidence to buy gifts online in december			1
‘ having hit the internet hard in november , as @entity1 neared closer some consumers chose to shop in store to make sure they had their gifts in their hand and not in the mail			0
‘ the main factor constraining online is the retailers themselves			2
their systems still show signs of strain at peak times and they need to be able to cope from order to delivery			0
’ head of retail consulting at @entity87 , @entity122 ( correct ) , said retailers need to be cautious about attempts to chase big volume sales around events like @entity4			1
he said : ‘ @entity4 was unquestionably a success for the value - seeking consumer , but for retailers themselves , its success is not quite as clear			1
‘ as the @entity133 reveals , spending was brought forward a month earlier , at much lower margins for retailers , as a result of the discounts available to customers in november			1
’ despite , these problems , he said : ‘ 2014 has been an important milestone for the online retail sector , with the £ 100 billion mark being exceeded for the first time			1
' when we consider that almost £ 1 in every £ 4 is now spent online , and that a large proportion of the other £ 3 is influenced by some form of digital interaction , it becomes very clear that retailers need to continue to embrace the opportunity that @entity152 poses			2
’ the @entity83 ’s @entity153 said : ‘ while the five per cent december online growth is lower than expected , the story of @entity1 trading online this year is one of compression			0
‘ the anticipated heavy discounting that was very widely communicated in advance of @entity4 served to concentrate the peak around that day in november			0
‘ the challenge going forward is that @entity4 has been cemented into shoppers ’ consciousness and they will expect the same kind of focused discounting next year			0
' as an industry , we will need to work together to understand how this extreme activity spike can best be managed in the interests of both shoppers and retailers			0

annual spending in the month rose by just five per cent - lowest increase over festive period since internet shopping took off decade ago
