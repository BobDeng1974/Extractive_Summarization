@entity1 ’s fledgling wine industry is threatened by a group of devastating plant diseases discovered in the country for the first time			0
experts at the @entity7 in recent months have identified four separate viruses which can obliterate grape crops			1
the diseases , spotted on vines at @entity7 gardens in @entity13 , @entity14 , and the @entity15 at @entity15			1
@entity16 , have damaged vineyards in wine - growing countries around the world			1
outbreaks of the disease can result in reduced yields , delayed fruit ripening and overly - acidic grapes			1
the only way to properly deal with the problem is to pull up the plants , experts say			1
experts at the @entity7 have identified four separate viruses which can obliterate grape crops ( file picture ) the warning comes after wine producers announced this week that they are to apply for the name ‘ @entity35 wine ’ to be given protected ‘ designation of origin ’ status , putting it in the same league as @entity41 and @entity42			1
the reputation of @entity1 wine has grown immeasurably in recent years , particularly in warm and sunny @entity35 , which has similar soil and climate to the @entity47 of @entity48			0
sales of sparking @entity1 wine are expected to hit £ 100million in 2015 , following a boom in the number of vineyards in recent years			0
in 2014 alone 46 wine producers opened in southern @entity1 , a 50 per cent year - on - year increase in new firms			2
vines are also becoming a popular plant in back gardens , with many homeowners trailing one over a trellis or up the inside of a conservatory			2
dr @entity64 , head of plant health at the @entity7 , said there is no sign the viruses have yet made it into commercial vineyards , but warned producers to be wary of the disease			2
writing in the trade journal the @entity73 , due to be published next month , he said : ‘ the discovery of four grapevine viruses not previously reported in the @entity77 during an in initial survey suggests there is no room for complacency			0
‘ these viruses have the potential to spread and cause damage to the @entity77 ’s developing grapevine industry			0
’ the four viruses cause different problems to plants , including leafroll disease , stem pitting , and fleck disease			2
outbreaks of the disease can result in reduced yields , delayed fruit ripening and overly - acidic grapes ( file picture ) they are thought to have come to our shores on imports of infected plants , but can also be spread by mealybugs and scale insects			1
dr @entity64 urged commercial vineyards to be aware of the risk and to only use plants that are certified as being virus - free			2
speaking to the @entity108 last night , he said : ‘ we found four of these viruses in @entity13 and one at @entity15			1
but we found them because we knew what we were looking for			0
‘ the symptoms could easily be mistaken for something else - nutrient deficiencies for example , or other problems			0
‘ we visited two commercial sites in @entity117 and @entity14 and found no signs of the viruses at either			1
’ but he said that until now there has been limited monitoring for viruses in @entity77 vineyards , so the diseases are likely to be i8n other sites as well			0
he added : ‘ it is reasonable to suggest that they could have spread further , but it is impossible to say how far			0
‘ luckily we have caught this early so we have opportunity to do something about it			0
