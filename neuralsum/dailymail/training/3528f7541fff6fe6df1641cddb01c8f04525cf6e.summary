by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor @entity2 is on course to easily win the @entity5 byelection on thursday , according to a new poll			2
a survey by conservative peer and pollster @entity9 puts the @entity10 on 42 per cent , 15 points ahead of second - placed @entity12 on 27 per cent - with @entity13 trailing in third on 20 per cent			1
the results emerged as the prime minister visited @entity5 for a fourth time in the campaign , telling voters he understood ' temptations ' to vote for other parties			0
but the @entity10 were hit by a separate national poll by @entity9 giving @entity13 a clear lead ahead of next years general election			1
across the country , @entity25 's party is now on 34 per cent , up three points on last week , with the @entity10 down four points to 25 per cent			1
meanwhile , the @entity29 were down two points on just six per cent , with @entity12 firmly entrenched in third place , up two points to 19 per cent			1
the @entity10 were installed as runaway favourites to hold on to the @entity5 seat on thursday after polls showed the party had a comfortable 15 per cent lead ahead of the by - election despite the national slump for the @entity10 , mr @entity2 will point to a jump in support in @entity5			1
the results show an upturn in support for the conservatives compared to last week 's @entity46 poll for the @entity47 which put the party on 36 per cent , with @entity12 on 28 per cent and @entity13 at 27 per cent			1
lord @entity9 said the differences shown by the two surveys could be down to his counting of ' shy voters ' who refuse to say or claim not to know how they will vote in relation to how they voted in the last election , with more of these likely to be @entity10			2
the @entity10 peer also released figures showing 70 per cent of voters planning to back @entity12 's @entity59 in the by - election are doing so in a general protest to show they are unhappy with all the parties			1
the poll also showed a majority of @entity12 supporters - more than six in 10 - said they were backing @entity69 's party to send a message that they were unhappy with their usual party			1
@entity12 is hoping to capitalise on its success in the recent local and @entity75 elections and overturn the @entity77 majority in the seat			0
@entity2 has thrown everything at the @entity5 by - election in a bid to avoid a humiliating defeat at the hands of @entity12			2
the pm appeared in the constituency today - speaking to workers at an electrical goods warehouse despite @entity13 trailing the @entity10 and @entity12 in @entity5 the party has pulled ahead in the national polls , according to @entity9 it became vacant when former @entity10 mp @entity91 , who had served as an independent since may last year , resigned over a lobbying scandal in april			1
he stepped down amid allegations he asked questions in @entity95 in return for money and did not contest the findings of a report into his conduct which suspended him from the @entity101 for six months			0
@entity69 ducked the chance to stand in @entity5			0
he claimed this weekend that he would instead choose a seat in the @entity104 of @entity105 mr @entity2 , who was on the campaign trail alongside foreign secretary @entity107 , admitted mr @entity91 had ' let down ' his constituents			2
' he did let you down			0
what he did was completely wrong , ' he said			0
' often in by - elections people think " well , you let me down , why should i ? " so i wanted to come here personally			0
' there 's always temptations to go off and vote for another party , to send a message about this or give the government a kick about that and that 's absolutely people 's right , we live in a democracy			0
you 're my boss - you 're his boss			0
if you think he 'd do a good job , vote for him ; if you think i do a good job , vote for me at the next election			0
if you want to get rid of me at the next election , vote for someone else			0
' mr @entity2 insisted @entity10 candidate @entity133 was committed to the @entity136 constituency 's long - term future unlike the other parties ' representatives , who the @entity91 claimed view the poll as a way to make gains in the run - up to the general election			1
he said : ' remember all those posters years ago - a dog is for life , not just for @entity147 - it is a bit the same with your member of @entity95			0
' i know @entity133 will be here , will be working hard because he is committed to the long - term future of people in @entity5 and @entity153			2
mr @entity69 backed @entity12 's candidate @entity59 to cause an upset in thursday 's crunch by - election ' the other parties just see this as trying to make a bit of progress for something else they want to do elsewhere in the country			1
that is how labour , how @entity12 , how the others are addressing this by - election			0
' shadow chancellor @entity168 and deputy labour leader @entity169 were also in @entity5 to support their candidate @entity170			0
@entity5 is a @entity10 heartland so it is no surprise that the constituency 's voters prefer @entity2 to @entity25			1
but even the third of voters unhappy with mr @entity2 's performance would prefer him in @entity178 to the @entity13 leader @entity13 supporters in the by - election seat want to see @entity25 in @entity182			1
but , worryingly for the @entity13 leader , almost one in five party supporters would prefer @entity2 as pm to mr @entity25 the other eight candidates standing in thursday 's election are : @entity187 for the @entity29 ; @entity188 from the @entity189 ; two independents @entity190 and @entity192 ; @entity193 from the @entity194 ; @entity195 from the @entity196 ; @entity197 from @entity201 's @entity198 and @entity199 from the @entity200			1
following the poll , the @entity10 are now just 1/6 favourites to win the by - election following with bookies @entity204			2
@entity206 of @entity204 said : ' @entity12 's only hope looks like a last minute switch of @entity13 support			2
if enough voters are prepared to vote tactically to give @entity2 a bloody nose , this might still be a close contest			0

@entity2 has visited the constituency four times to halt @entity12 rise
@entity91 tells workers he understands why they might be ' tempted ' by @entity69
but voters appear to be *swinging* behind @entity10 candidate @entity133
separate national poll puts @entity13 on 34 ***%*** - nine points ahead of @entity10
@entity226 's @entity29 slump to just 6 ***%*** nationally - with @entity12 on 19 ***%***
