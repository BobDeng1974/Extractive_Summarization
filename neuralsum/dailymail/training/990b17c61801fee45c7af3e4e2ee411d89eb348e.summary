by @entity0 published : 06:35 est , 8 november 2013 updated : 11:54 est , 11 november 2013 these pictures show an enchanting ' hobbit house ' , complete with stained glass windows , dovecotes and turrets , built in the middle of the @entity8 countryside			1
the imaginative property was built entirely by hand by artist and farmer @entity12 , 68 , who today said he originally planned to build a rectangular hay store barn - but ' got a bit carried away '			1
mr @entity12 first bought the land in the 1980s with compensation money he received following an accident			1
@entity18 : @entity12 , 68 , spent 11 years building this magical two - storey @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity8 hand - built : the farmer and artist said he started constructing the building - which features several turrets and dovecotes - from stones he found on his land @entity28 : mr @entity12 made his barn - initially made for storing hay and grain - using dry stone walling techniques and then secured the walls with concrete on the interior he lived in a cottage 400 yards away and farmed sheep on the land in @entity20 , @entity8 and decided he needed a place to store hay and other supplies			1
mr @entity12 began building a rectangular barn by using traditional dry - stone walling techniques before securing the walls with concrete			1
but rather than stopping at four walls , the building - which took him 11 years to complete - began to grow until it eventually became the unusual build it is today			1
mr @entity12 , who now farms sheep , poultry and angora rabbits near to @entity52 , @entity53 , said : ' i bought some land , around 10 acres , in the 1980s when i got some money following an accident			1
' there was a lot of stone lying around in the fields			2
i collected it up and used it to build the barn			0
' i just did it bit by bit			0
i started small - laying all the stones up and pouring concrete down the back to secure it and it just continued to grow			2
' i think i just got a bit carried away really			2
' rather than a modest barn , i started building turrets and dovecots - which were inhabited by lots of birds , including one owl that lived there the whole time i owned the land			2
architecture : the build features several arches , left , plus tens of hand made windows and turrets , right , all constructed by the artist - who farmed sheep on the land ' organic ' : mr @entity12 said he did not draw any plans for the sprawling barn , which he based on a selection of buildings he had liked throughout his life enchanting : through one of the entrances to the barn , left , is a spiral staircase which leads to the top of one of the dovecotes			1
there is also some detailed stained glass , right , that depicts two autumnal scenes including a badger on the left and a bird flying above the building on the right ' i also had a room up the top where i would sleep during lambing season			1
' i did n't draw any plans before hand - it just grew organically			2
i took inspiration from buildings that i had seen during my life that looked like they were part of their surroundings			0
i like buildings to look like they belong			0
' the barn is split into several different rooms with varying levels			0
one section - called ' @entity131 ' by mr @entity12 - has several stained glass windows , all hand - made by mr @entity12			1
' the windows represent spring , summer , autumn and winter as well as earth , air , fire and water , and are just another nod to the natural world , ' mr @entity12 said			1
however , having spent over a decade on his magical building , mr @entity12 - who said he does n't know how the build first became known as the @entity19 - sold up when a quarry opened nearby			1
mr @entity12 said : ' i do n't like it when people call it the @entity19			2
i never made it to look like that			0
i just call it my barn			0
there are also apparently rumours that i had a dispute with the planning office - which is utter nonsense			0
i moved on because of a quarry			0
' they found @entity156 - which is in high demand - near to my land			2
i knew there would be lots of lorries trundling in and out constantly so i decided to give it all up			0
' when i first sold up , i had dreams about it every night			0
a woman spends nine months carrying a child , but i spent 11 years on the barn			1
i felt lost without it			0
' although it was a really difficult decision , know i made the right choice			0
i 've moved on and have done other things			0
mr @entity12 added that he had only been back to the building once since he left in 2000			1
@entity173 : the barn includes a place for mr @entity12 to sleep during lambing season , pictured left , and several examples of the artist 's stained glass windows , right artistic : this picture shows another window made by mr @entity12			1
with its flowers and muted tones , it is suppose to represent the spring months of the year unique : mr @entity12 , who calls this yellow - walled section of the build ' @entity131 ' , also made several art pieces for the barn , pictured the ' @entity19 ' has now become a frequent stop for photographers and explorers looking to capture some of the building 's @entity195 photographer @entity194 , 28 , took this set of images after he decided to track down the quirky @entity199 said : ' normally buildings like this are built for novelty , but once upon a time this was actually someone ’s home			1
'' it felt like i was in a movie like @entity209 or @entity210 , and i half expected a tiny person to ask me what i was doing in there			0
it has such a magical feel about it			0
” ' this little hobbit house was amazingly hand built by @entity12 many years ago his treasured animals			2
'' he built it all on his own , stone by stone and the stained glass windows were all hand painted			1
' there was not much inside the building , just an old table and benches made from logs , but it had an enchanting feel to it			0
' i really enjoy documenting old buildings , and being able to grab a part of history while it ’s still there			0
' relocation : mr @entity12 sold the land the property was built on the 2000 when a quarry was built nearby			1
he now lives and farms in @entity53			2

@entity244 and stained glass artist @entity12 , 68 , bought 10 acres of land near @entity20 , @entity8 in the 1980s
collected stones left on land before starting work on a hay store using dry stone walling techniques
mr @entity12 then spent 11 years creating magical two - storey property and said today , ' i just got a bit carried away . '
includes dovecots , several turrets and a selection of hand - made stained glass windows created by the artist
mr @entity264 , who now farms in @entity53 , sold land where the property is built in 2000 when a quarry was built nearby
