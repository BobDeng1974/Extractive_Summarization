the book was first published in 2013 and according to its description on @entity25 , it ' illuminates the struggle between once - dominant megaplayers and the new micropowers challenging them in every field of human endeavor			1
' @entity35 remains the gold standard for choosing books , though clubs have been started by ' @entity39 ' and the ' today ' show , among others			0

thank you to all 50,000 of you in our community who gave me suggestions for different challenges			0
many of you proposed reading challenges			0
@entity61 suggested i read one book a month that another person chooses -- and got 1,900 likes on her suggestion			1
@entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and others suggested i read the @entity70			2
my friend and colleague @entity71 suggested i read and learn everything i can about a new country each week			2
i 'm excited for my reading challenge			2
i 've found reading books very intellectually fulfilling			0
books allow you to fully explore a topic and immerse yourself in a deeper way than most media today			0
i 'm looking forward to shifting more of my media diet towards reading books			0
if you want to follow along on my challenge and read the same books i do , i 've created a page , a @entity86 , where i 'll post what i 'm reading			1
please only participate in the discussions if you 've actually read the books and have relevant points to add			2
the group will be moderated to keep it focused			0
our first book of the year will be @entity20 by @entity21			1
it 's a book that explores how the world is shifting to give individual people more power that was traditionally only held by large governments , militaries and other organizations			1
the trend towards giving people more power is one i believe in deeply , and i 'm looking forward to reading this book and exploring this in more detail			1
i appreciated all of your other suggestions for possible challenges as well			0
many of you suggested i give money to help people in need -- and @entity116 and i fully intend to keep doing that through our philanthropic work			2
we 'll have more to discuss there soon			0
some of you suggested that i meet a new person every day			0
that was actually my challenge in 2013			2
others suggested i teach a class			0
i 've done that too , and i 'd love to do it again and get more involved in education in the coming year			0
thanks again for all of your suggestions , and i 'm looking forward to a year of books ! via @entity2			1
