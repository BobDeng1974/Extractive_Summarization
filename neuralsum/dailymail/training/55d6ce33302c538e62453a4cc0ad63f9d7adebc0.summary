by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter the @entity3 deported @entity5 children as young as 1 - 1/2 years old on monday in the first flight since president @entity7 pledged to speed up the process of sending back illegal immigrant minors from @entity10			1
fleeing violence and poverty , record numbers of children from @entity5 , @entity15 and @entity16 have crossed into the @entity3 over the past year , sparking intense debate about how to solve the problem			1
monday 's flight from @entity20 to @entity21 , the city with the highest murder rate in the world , returned 17 @entity5 women , as well as 12 girls and nine boys , aged between 18 months and 15 years			1
the flight was the first of many according to immigration officials the @entity5 were from among a group of immigrants who 've been housed at an @entity51 , @entity20 emergency detention facility opened as other centers became completely overwhelmed			1
the @entity54 was opened in barracks of the @entity56			2
it eventually will hold about 700 women and children			0
homeland security secretary @entity60 visited the facility in a visit that seemed crafted to show detainees that @entity10 is not the welcoming place they may have thought			1
' our border is not open to illegal immigration , ' he said			0
' our message to those who come illegally is we will send you back			2
' looking happy , the deported children exited the airport on an overcast and sweltering afternoon			2
one by one , they filed into a bus , playing with balloons they had been given			0

the @entity51 center was opened as an overflow facility as centers elsewhere have become too full to house any more @entity83 shows a play room in an area where immigrant families are housed in the @entity51 center , which will eventually hold around 700 detainees overflow : @entity83 , public information officer for @entity89 , shows a dormitory where immigrant families are housed at the @entity92 inside the @entity93 in @entity51 , @entity20 @entity94 , a 6 - year - old girl among the deportees , said she left @entity5 a month ago for a journey that ended when she and her mother were caught on the @entity78 border two weeks later			1
' horrible , cold and tiring , ' was how @entity94 remembered the trip that was meant to unite the pair with her three uncles already living in the @entity3			0
instead , her mother @entity102 paid $ 7,000 in vain to a coyote , or guide , to smuggle them both across the border			0
once caught , @entity3 officials treated them like ' animals ' , holding them in rooms with as many as 50 people , where some mothers had to sleep standing up holding children , @entity102 said			0
during the eight months ended june 15 , some 52,000 children were detained at the @entity3 border with @entity20 , most of them from @entity10			1
unhappy return : a bus was set to take the wary travelers back to the homes they so desperately wanted to leave dangerous : a girls stands next to the bus ( right ) that will drop the 40 @entity5 deportees from the @entity3 near their homes or at the bus station in @entity21 , which has the highest murder rate in the world			1

so chaotic are the circumstances of the exodus that some of the children are not even correctly reunited with their parents , said @entity152 , director of the @entity153 for returned migrants in @entity5			1
' many of the mothers are sometimes not even the real mothers of the children , ' she said			0
monday 's flight departed as @entity7 faces increasing pressure to address the surge of unaccompanied minors			0
immigrant advocates urge him to address the humanitarian needs of the migrants			2
at the same time , republicans in @entity166 have blamed the crisis on @entity7 's immigration policies and have called on him to secure the border			0
@entity7 's administration has stressed that @entity10 children who cross the border illegally will be sent home , and last week said it would speed up the deportation process			1
@entity5 , @entity15 and @entity16 have suffered from gang violence and incursions from @entity178 drug cartels using the region as a staging post for their trafficking operations			1
@entity5 president @entity184 , in an interview published on monday , blamed @entity3 drug policy for sparking violence and ramping up migration to the @entity3			2
his wife urged the @entity3 to do more to help			0
' the countries consuming drugs need to support ( us ) and take joint responsibility because if there was n't demand , there would n't be production and we would n't be living like we are , ' @entity136 said as she awaited the children			0
@entity7 's administration has projected that without government action , more than 150,000 unaccompanied children under the age of 18 could flee the three @entity10 nations next year			1
the proposed actions will test @entity7 's ability to negotiate effectively with @entity204 lawmakers who have blocked much of his agenda ahead of a november election when they hope to capture the @entity208 from his @entity209			0
meanwhile , in @entity16 : part of a group of 16 @entity16 children caught in @entity20 while trying to migrate illegally into the @entity3 queue before climbing into a minibus at @entity216 international airport in @entity217 these children likely would have become part of the thousands held at the southern @entity3 border had they not been nabbed by @entity178 authorities before they were able to make the crossing			1
they 're now headed back to @entity16 president @entity7 's administration wants to take more action to send home children who cross the border from @entity10 on their own , writes @entity227			1
the government claims more than 150,000 children could flee three nations south of the border next year - and there is no lower limit on their ages			2
last month it emerged hundreds of toddlers under the age of two were caught travelling alone in a desperate bid by their parents to get them into the @entity3 the growing number of immigrants trying to make it into the @entity3 is being driven in part by a misconception that children wo n't be deported			1
but this is a misinterpretation of a 2012 policy that delays the deportation of illegal immigrants brought to the @entity3 as children prior to 2007			2
the sheer numbers and complexity mean unaccompanied children are more likely than adults to slip through the cracks and ultimately remain in the @entity3 for months or even years			0
once captured , most minors are processed and reunited with family members or a guardian in the @entity3 while they await deportation proceedings			0
but detention facilities are generally not equipped to handle young people , especially infants and toddlers			0
because of the significant backlog and lack of resources put into tracking them , few are expected to ever return and face immigration judges .			0
