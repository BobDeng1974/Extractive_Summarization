by @entity0 the combination of a thin atmosphere and lack of oxygen makes the chances of finding life on the surface of @entity8 slim			1
however , it has long been theorised that life could survive underground – but getting there has posed a problem			2
one solution though might be @entity13 , a proposal from a team of scientists to launch missiles into the surface of the red planet packed with probes rather than explosives			1
a team of scientists from the non-profit group @entity24 have come up with a proposal that they say could find life beneath the surface of the red planet			1
called @entity13 , the mission would fire missiles at the surface and bury experiments underground the proposal comes from the non-profit group @entity24 , based in @entity32 , @entity33			1
amongst its team includes @entity36 , who previously led an experiment on one of @entity41 ’s 1976 @entity40 landers that he was certain found evidence of life , although @entity41 disagreed			2
now he and the rest of the team are hoping to prove once and for all that the red planet is habitable with their ambitious proposal			2
‘ @entity13 incorporates a delivery system that was originally designed for military purposes , ’ the team writes on their website			2
the mission would use a series of small lightweight penetrator probes called ‘ arrows ’ that would take life detection equipment underground			1
they would do this by impacting the surface at high speeds after being released from a carrier spacecraft			1
a series of @entity57 the company calls a ‘ quiver ’ would be integrated into a lander and released as it made its way to the surface			0
within each impactor would be experiments at the tip and communications equipment at the back so it could relay information to an orbiting spacecraft and then back to @entity78			0
the arrows would also have a drilling capability allowing them to dig down to a total of 16.5 ft ( five metres )			0
each missile , known as an @entity57 , has a hardened penetrator on the front end and has a set of fins on the back end			0
the middle of the probe is a cylinder that splits into two pieces when the arrow impacts the surface			0
the first piece stays with the penetrator and burrows into the @entity8 surface to a depth of up to 6.5 feet ( two metres ) this piece contains the life detection experiment in a small cylinder behind the penetrator			1
this ‘ metabolic test ’ could distinguish between non-living chemistry and living microorganisms			0
the team says if it detects life the experiment could determine if it is related to @entity78 life or is a new strain			0
the second piece stays on the surface , where the fins act as stops to prevent it from going down into the hole			0
this piece houses the radio equipment that sends the signals back to an orbiting relay on one of the existing @entity8 orbiters			2
once successfully deployed , the life detection experiment begins			1
by deploying multiple probes , data sampling is expanded to multiple sites , which improves the science and reliability			0
having multiple probes allows for individual probe failures without losing the entire mission			2
this concept borrows from several engineering designs already in practice			0
the penetrator design is based on military ‘ bunker buster ’ technology			0
the split segments concept was pioneered by @entity41 in the late 1990 ’s on the @entity134 mission			0
@entity13 would be carrier to @entity8 by another spacecraft			1
the mission could comprise several penetrator probes , known as ' arrows ' , that would be held in a ' quiver ' on the carrier vehicle , which would safely transport them through the atmosphere ( artist 's illustration shown ) once through the atmosphere the lander carrying the quiver would deploy its parachute and begin its gradual descent to the surface , at which point the arrows would be released to various locations the team hopes to begin testing the concept in the @entity155 later this year			1
this location , they say , features @entity8 - like characteristics that will allow the concept to be tested to an adequate degree			0
‘ we will be able to test both the delivery system ( from an aircraft ) as well as the ground penetrating arrows , ’ they write			0
‘ these tests will verify the average depth of penetration and the life detection experiment within the arrows			1
’ this will be phase 1 of the tests – phase 2 will be to test the microbial life detection experiments			1
the team says that a number of upcoming @entity8 missions , including @entity41 ’s @entity180 mission and @entity183 ’s 2018 @entity182 mission , could carry @entity13			1
‘ once the concept is sufficiently tested and we have proven the viability of the mission concept , ’ the team writes			0
‘ we will urge @entity41 , other space agencies , and potential commercial providers to carry @entity13 on one or more future @entity8 missions			2
’ the arrows would bury initially to about 6.5 feet ( two metres )			0
using a drill , however , they could bury to a total depth of 16.5 feet ( five metres ) where life detection equipment would be deployed @entity41 's @entity197 ( artist 's illustration shown ) is currently on @entity8 trying to ascertain if the red planet was or still is habitable			1
the @entity13 team hope that their mission can be incorporated on a future @entity8 mission such as @entity41 's insight in 2016 or @entity183 's @entity182 in 2018 .			1

a team of scientists has come up with a novel proposal to find life on @entity8
the team from explore @entity8 says missiles could be equipped with probes
the @entity13 mission would deploy the missiles from a carrier spacecraft
multiple missiles would impact the surface and bury underground
life detection equipment would then *search* for living organisms
