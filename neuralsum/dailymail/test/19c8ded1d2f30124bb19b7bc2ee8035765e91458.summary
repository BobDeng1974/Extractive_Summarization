@entity0 have confirmed that experienced duo @entity1 and @entity2 will both start friday night 's @entity4 match with @entity5 at @entity6			1
both skipper @entity1 and @entity2 - who have played nearly 300 matches between them for the club - are to retire come the end of may and each have a maximum of six outings left of their distinguished professional careers			1
and while @entity16 head coach @entity16 was naming his full squad for the @entity5 match on thursday , he announced that the second - row and hooker would start in the pack against the @entity22 outfit			1
@entity0 veteran @entity1 will start at lock against @entity5 at @entity6 on friday night the encounter is being billed as a tribute to them both and , in a nice touch by the club , the match ball will be presented by @entity1 's dad and @entity2 's mum along with @entity32 , who was @entity1 's best man , and @entity33 , who was an inspirational figure for @entity2 coming through at @entity36 / @entity35			1
having been a pro player for 13 years and earned 42 @entity39 caps , @entity2 admits it will be a strange feeling hanging up his boots for good at the end of the current campaign			1
' you get to a point where you start thinking to yourself ' this could be the last game of rugby i ever play ' so you want to make the most of it , ' the 34 - year - old said			2
' i really want to enjoy these last few games , but also stay focused and help the @entity0 secure a play - off place and hopefully the trophy			2
@entity55 hooker @entity2 is hanging up his boots after 13 years of professional rugby as retirement draws closer you do start to think more about the things that you love about the game			1
you start to think about your last team huddle , the last time you will walk out onto the pitch with your team mates and it is those moments that i will miss incredibly			0
' since he first played in the equivalent of the @entity4 for @entity68 back in @entity65 has seen the standard of all of the sides improve incredibly			2
as a result , despite the fact that the @entity0 are first and the @entity5 are 10th in the table , he does not expect an easy night , far from it			1
' they have a number of quality players in their side and a lot of internationals while all of the teams are getting better year on year , ' he explained			0
' we really have to concentrate on what we are doing ourselves and keep getting results and hopefully that takes care of things and gets us into the play - offs in the coming weeks			0
' i hope that gone are the days when the @entity4 is looked on as a lesser league , the teams and the talent involved now really is top class			0
' @entity16 's @entity55 side are currently top of the @entity99 standings ahead of @entity101 's visit this season @entity2 has been restricted to seven appearances in the @entity4 for the warriors to date , @entity105 and @entity106 playing the majority of minutes with @entity108 also pushing hard for game time in the number two jersey			1
and while @entity2 himself admits that he may not be in the gym as often as the younger trio , he feels the experience he has gained in over 140 match for the club can still help during the league run - in and in the play - offs			2
' the last thing you want to do when you have played for all those years is to pick up an injury in the gym , ' @entity2 explained			1
' for me now it is all about managing myself throughout the week so that when it comes to getting out on the field i can give it everything			0
' as you get older you perhaps become a bit more of a leader in the group , but i like to think i have acted like that since i came to the @entity0 in 2007			0
wales prop @entity134 is a doubt for @entity101 as the loosehead struggles with a calf strain ' i was the starting hooker for a number of years and as @entity106 , and more recently , @entity105 and @entity108 have come in i hope they have learnt from watching what i do and also have learnt from what i say too			0
' meanwhile , @entity5 prop @entity134 is a doubt for the match with a calf strain			2
the injury forced the @entity133 and @entity147 ' man off last week in his side 's @entity149 quarter - final defeat to the @entity151			0
' @entity134 has got a calf strain but it is not as bad as we thought			0
he has n't trained this week so is a doubt , but he is keen to play a few more games for us yet this season , ' @entity5 attack coach @entity155 said			1
' we want to play to a game plan , execute well and perform to the best of our ability			0
to do justice to the league we have to do that			0
' @entity55 are a good offloading side , they are a complete side in many ways , and we 've got to control the ball better than we did last weekend			2

the @entity55 duo have played nearly 300 games between them
@entity1 and @entity2 will both retire at the end of the season
