they believe that if a woman has a son , some of his cells pass into her body before reaching her brain			1
and the male dna may linger there for decades			1
@entity14 : scientists believe that if a woman has a son , some of his cells pass into her body before reaching her - and the male dna may linger there for decades while there is no evidence it makes the woman more masculine , it may have important implications for her health			1
@entity27 scientists examined brain specimens from 59 women who had died between the ages of 32 and 101			2
a gene that is carried on the y chromosome – and so should only be found in men – was present in almost two - thirds of the brains			0
the researchers , from the @entity37 in @entity38 , say the most likely explanation is the gene came from a son when he was carried in the womb			2
helping hand : the male dna may help a woman fight breast cancer by boosting her immune response in the same way that a mother passes oxygen and nutrients to her unborn child through the placenta , ‘ traffic ’ , including cells , also moves in the other direction			1
the study suggests that the baby ’s cells – or their descendants – persist in the mother for decades , as male dna was found in the brain of a woman who died aged 94			1
it is thought having a daughter also leaves a mark on the mother ’s brain – but testing for this would be more difficult			2
the study , published in the journal @entity73 , is the first to find male dna in women ’s brains			1
it is too early to say what effect , if any , it has			0
previous studies have found male cells in women ’s blood , bone marrow , hearts , lungs , livers and other organs			2
and the phenomenon , which is known as microchimerism , is thought to be good for a woman ’s health			0
a vaccine that cuts the odds of premature births , miscarriages and other problems in pregnancy is a step closer			0
scientists have shed light on white blood cells made by the mother - to - be which suppress her immune system and stop it attacking the ‘ foreign ’ baby			1
it is thought that some complications in pregnancy may be caused by not having enough protective cells , or them not working properly			0
the study , published in the journal nature , found the cells rein in the immune system while still protecting the mother against infections			1
the male dna may help a woman fight breast cancer by boosting her immune response			1
it may also help with rheumatoid arthritis and the repair of damaged tissues			0
some scientists believe that the infusion of ‘ fresh ’ cells from child to mother could help explain why women tend to live longer than men			2
but microchimerism has also been linked to higher odds of bowel and skin cancer			0
researcher dr @entity136 said : ‘ @entity138 microchimerism – the presence of foetal cells in the mother – appears to be something of a @entity144 phenomenon			0
’ she added that finding out more about how the cells cause or protect against disease could lead to new treatments			0
‘ better understanding of the actions of the transferred cells could someday allow clinicians to harness the stowaways ’ beneficial effects while limiting their destructive potential , ’ said dr @entity136 .			0
