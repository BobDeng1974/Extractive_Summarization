@entity0 has admitted he does not know how much a supermarket loaf costs – because he bakes his own using a bread - making machine			1
the prime minister was asked the price of a ‘ value ’ range loaf after claiming he is not out of touch with ordinary people over the rising cost of living			1
he guessed it was more than £ 1 – in fact it is 47p – then by way of explanation got himself into a deeper hole by saying he does not eat ‘ the value stuff ’			2
scroll down for audio hardworking : @entity0 used a series of tv interviews to reject claims he is out of touch , before plugging artisan flour and breadmakers instead he uses a £ 100 breadmaker and a brand of @entity27 artisan flour which costs around £ 4.40 a bag			1
in comparison a 1.5kg bag of @entity32 ’s own brand flour costs only 65p			1
mr @entity0 has often highlighted his credentials as a domesticated husband and father , being filmed doing the washing up and boasting of making pancakes on a sunday morning in his constituency home in @entity40			1
yesterday on @entity41 he was asked to name the price of a ‘ value sliced white bread loaf at @entity32 or @entity45 ’s ’			2
mr @entity0 replied : ‘ it ’s going to cost you north of £ 1			1
’ kitchen cabinet : mr @entity0 has often boasted of his culinary skills , including being pictured making a fruit salad in the kitchen of his constituency home near when leader of the opposition tour : mr @entity0 pictured outside the main conference hall with his aide , @entity58 mp @entity57 scrum : mr @entity0 is in the media spotlight ahead of his keynote speech to the @entity58 conference tomorrow to the real baker , the idea of using a breadmaker is worse than cheating , it is an insult to the craft of creating a loaf from scratch			1
great @entity73 @entity72 's @entity71 teases those who rely on a machine , saying : ' not really baking , is it ? ' but @entity0 insists his @entity79 applicance does the job , turning his expensive local flour into delicious granary loaves for his children			1
the most popular model which the @entity85 are believed to have starts at £ 100 , able to create nine different bread types including wholemeal , @entity90 bread and pizza dough			2
reminded that he was being asked about a value sliced loaf , he said : ‘ i do n’t buy the value stuff ... i ’ve got a breadmaker which i delight in using and it turns out in all sorts of different ways			2
’ he rejected suggestions that making bread at home takes too long , saying : ‘ you think ahead			0
a little plug for the flour made in my constituency : the @entity106			0
' you get some of that – beautifully milled in the @entity27 – you pop that in your breadmaker			0
‘ you can set the timer overnight so when you wake up there ’s this wonderful smell wafting through your kitchen			0
it takes 30 seconds to put your ingredients in			0
’ it is understood the @entity85 have the cheapest @entity79 model of breadmaker , which starts at £ 100			2
@entity120 vice-chairman @entity119 said : ‘ when he said , “ i have a breadmaker ” most people will have assumed he had his own personal baker			2
’ rebellious @entity58 mp @entity126 once described mr @entity0 and @entity127 as ‘ posh boys who do n’t know the price of milk ’			1
on monday @entity131 admitted he did not know the price of a pint of milk			2
yesterday , asked about value bread , he joked : ‘ i can tell you the price of a bottle of champagne , how about that ? ’ crumbs : mr @entity0 laughed off the exchange with @entity41 presenter @entity143 @entity144 mayor @entity131 admitted he did not know the price of a pint of milk @entity131 was forced to admit on tv that he did not know how much a pint of milk cost - but he did not seem to care			1
the @entity144 mayor told @entity152 's @entity151 how the cost of living was going to be a big political issue at the next election			0
he was asked by presenter @entity156 : ' do you even know the cost of pint of milk ? ' but mr @entity131 replied : ' about 80p or something like that ... ' told it was actually half that at 40p , he conceded : ' well there you go , i do n't know how much a pint of milk costs			1
so what ? ' you could almost hear his aides choking on their croissants as they feared a pr disaster			0
by boasting that he ‘ delights ’ in using his own bread - making machine , @entity0 made a lifestyle statement that risked alienating the millions who have n’t the time or inclination to make their own loaves			2
there ’s no doubting the appeal of the smell of a baked loaf in the morning or of the fact it lacks the additives found in the supermarket loaves the prime minister says he eschews			1
the trouble is , though , that the economics do n’t quite stack up			0
i know this , because i own a @entity193 – perhaps the very model mr @entity0 owns			2
dough : the prime minister recommended a @entity79 breadmaker and the @entity106 flour made near his @entity40 constituency it clutters up our kitchen with myriad other gadgets			1
although my wife loves it , i wish i could just throw the damn thing away			0
@entity208 , they are a rip - off			0
a @entity79 breadmaker will cost up to £ 150 – about 320 ‘ value ’ loaves of bread			1
and that ’s before you include the price of the ingredients			0
mr @entity0 says he buys a brand of flour called @entity106 , that sells for a whopping £ 4.38 per 1.5kg bag			1
@entity0 does not use any ordinary flour from a budget supermarket			1
the @entity106 variety he hailed on the radio is produced by millers @entity225 , which traces its roots back to @entity40 in the 1860s			0
the dark variety is described as ' the connoisseur 's blend of strong white flour , malt flour , malted wheat flakes and rye flour for bread and rolls '			2
it costs £ 21.40 for five 1.5kg bags , working out at £ 4.38 per bag			1
by contrast , a bag of strong white bread flour in @entity32 costs just 80p			1
to make a basic sandwich loaf in a @entity79 breadmaker , you need 400g of flour			1
that ’s £ 1.17 worth of lovely @entity106			0
then you ’ll need 15g of butter ( about 7p ) , about 5p worth of yeast and about 2p of sugar and salt			0
( the 280 ml of water is a negligible cost – 0.03p			0
) this brings the grand total to just over £ 1.30			0
at first , that does n’t seem too much			0
but wait , we ’ve forgotten something – the cost of the electricity ! breadmakers use , on average 550 watts , and it takes five hours to make a sandwich loaf			0
that means , at a rate of 14.5p per kilowatt hour , that will cost 40p a loaf			0
so , adding the original price of the machine ( and assuming it lasts long enough to make 1,000 loaves ) , the total cost per @entity0 loaf will be £ 1.85 , or the equivalent of nearly four ‘ value ’ loaves			1
of course mr @entity0 could use normal flour at 80p per 1.5kg , which would reduce the cost of a loaf to 95p			1
but that is still the cost of two ‘ value ’ loaves			0
and then there ’s the fact that breadmakers are hardly the easiest of gadgets to look after			0
( mr @entity0 himself admits that while busy running the country , dealing with @entity290 and liaising with foreign leaders , using his @entity79 breadmaker means having to regularly set it up several hours in advance			1
) then , if my experience is anything to go by , the kneading blade often gets left inside the loaf , and the bits of burned bread are difficult to clean off the baking tin			0
also , because the bread does n’t have factory - added preservatives , it tends to go stale quickly			0
another problem is that my @entity79 loaves are smaller than the average 800g loaf bought in a shop			2
unlike the prime minister , i think breadmakers are a con , and by recommending their use , he reveals that he is more out of touch than simply not knowing the price of bread			1
the next time he is interviewed about such things , he ’d be better advised to use his loaf .			0

prime minister struggles to name price of a budget supermarket loaf
guesses at more than £ 1 but explains he does n't buy value bread
reveals he uses a @entity79 breadmaker to make granary loaves
plugs ' @entity337 crunch ' flour costs £ 4.38 per bag , five times @entity32 brand
@entity120 says mr @entity0 's boasts are ' almost a parody of himself '
@entity131 admits he does not know how much a pint of milk costs
