by @entity0 a former soldier was yesterday found guilty of murdering a schoolgirl nearly 30 years ago in @entity4 ’s first ‘ cold case ’ conviction			1
bus driver @entity6 strangled @entity7 yards from her home as she returned from a disco in 1986 , and lived a normal life until police reinvestigating the crime knocked on his door two years ago			1
technological advances meant @entity15 recovered from the 16 - year - old ’s body was linked to @entity6 , who still lived in @entity18 , @entity19 , less than a mile from the lane where the murder happened			1
bus driver @entity6 ( left ) strangled @entity7 ( right ) yards from her home as she returned from a disco the father of one agreed to a mouth swab test after the visit from officers working on the cold case inquiry			1
it was later found the chances of the dna belonging to anyone other than @entity6 , 49 , were around one billion to one			1
as he was found guilty after a marathon trial at the @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity7 ’s mother @entity32 spoke of her family ’s 28 - year ‘ nightmare ’			1
thanking lord advocate @entity40 , @entity41 , and police who brought @entity6 to justice , mrs @entity7 , 72 , of @entity39 , @entity19 , paid tribute to the ‘ people of @entity47 who have lived this nightmare with us for 28 years and always supported our family ’			1
@entity51 : @entity7 's half naked body was found in a lane just yards from the safety of her own home mrs @entity7 , a widow , added : ‘ the result at court does n’t make our day - to - day living any easier			1
' the pain does n’t go away but my son @entity60 and i take comfort that we now have justice for @entity7 , which is all we , especially her dad @entity65 , campaigned for			1
’ @entity6 , now of @entity66 , @entity67 , was found guilty of strangling the teenager after a struggle that tore a clump of hair from her head			1
he stripped the terrified girl , or forced her to take off her clothes , in a lane yards from her home in @entity77 , @entity18 , on june 2 , 1986			2
@entity6 slipped through the net when detectives apparently simply forgot to question him			2
but years later @entity15 evidence – unknown in crime scene investigations at the time of @entity7 ’s death – was found on samples taken from her naked body			1
forensic scientist @entity87 said the odds against it belonging to anyone but @entity6 were a billion to one , while pathologist @entity91 said evidence pointed to the assailant strangling @entity7 from behind			1
historic case : police officers stand at the scene of the murder in @entity18 where @entity7 died the majority verdict , after more than four hours , rejected @entity6 ’s claim that he was at home with his parents in the town ’s @entity101			1
the eight women and seven men had heard 52 days of evidence , and hours were spent dealing with the unprecedented defence claim that a list of 41 ‘ suspects ’ might include the real killer			2
besides @entity7 , who had a part - time job as a jeweller ’s assistant , and her friends at the @entity116 disco , was @entity6			1
he was with @entity117 , who told police @entity6 had been with him			2
police failed to go straight to @entity6 to confirm the story			2
as forensic scientists refined techniques for extracting dna from crime scene samples , they returned to the tape pressed against @entity7 ’s body in the hope of trapping tell - tale fibres			1
@entity6 has been remanded in custody to await sentencing in @entity130 in august finally , in march 2006 , persistence paid off but the microscopic result did not match any likely suspects whose dna was held on any @entity135 database			2
@entity136 was launched and police sought dna samples from all the men in the investigation files			0
by may 2012 , they had traced @entity6 , an ex-royal engineer who had returned to @entity18			2
he willingly took the mouth swab test that gave police their breakthrough			0
another vital link in the chain came when a key witness , @entity146 , looked at photos taken to his @entity149 home			0
mr @entity146 , now 52 , had described a man with staring , angry eyes he had seen with a girl near @entity77 at around the time @entity7 might have been there			2
he told detectives in september 2012 a photo , culled from @entity156 ’s @entity155 , reminded him of the fleeting encounter 26 years earlier			0
@entity6 did not give evidence but his defence team attacked the police investigation			2
even senior officers leading the murder hunt admitted in court there were shortcomings			0
the so - called mistakes began with an act of compassion when a police blanket was draped over @entity7 to shield her body from onlookers			1
defence qc @entity173 claimed the scene had been so contaminated the dna evidence was not reliable			0
judge @entity176 told jurors although they had heard criticism of the early investigation , ‘ extraordinary persistence , skill and determination ’ had brought the case to court			2
he told @entity6 the only sentence for murder was life but called for a background report			0
@entity6 was remanded in custody to await sentencing in @entity130 in august			0
as he left court , @entity7 ’s brother @entity191 , 49 , said : ‘ the jury returned the right decision			1
i always knew @entity6 was guilty			0
’ detective superintendent @entity195 of @entity196 said the ‘ senseless murder of @entity7 has cast a long shadow over @entity18 ’			1
the conviction is a major success for a specialist unit set up by the @entity202 in june 2011 to help crack ‘ cold cases ’			0
describing the work of the new unit , mr @entity40 said 93 unsolved murders dating back to 1974 would come under scrutiny			0
the @entity7 murder was the first case to go to trial following an investigation by the new @entity202 cold case unit			0
it was launched in 2011 , with law chief lord advocate @entity40 , @entity41 , vowing to snare killers who had evaded justice for years			0
he said the specialist team would use new forensic science techniques – including those related to @entity15 , ballistics and fingerprint databases – to determine which cases merited fresh investigation			0
he said : ‘ we wo n’t give up and will seek to identify perpetrators using new forensic and other investigation techniques and prosecute them			0
’ about 70 murders , going back more than 100 years , remain unsolved			0
high - profile cases include that of banker @entity231 , 30 , shot dead on the doorstep of his home in @entity234 in 2004			0
earlier this year , the @entity202 said convicted paedophile @entity235 – long linked to the disappearance of @entity237 , 11 , in 1957 – would be prosecuted if he were alive today			0
following a review by the cold case unit , investigators declared he would have been charged over the death of the youngster , who went missing near her home in @entity245 , @entity246 .			0
