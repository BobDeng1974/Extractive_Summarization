by @entity0 published : 05:04 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 08:35 est , 13 september 2013 a @entity2 fisherman kidnapped by @entity3 41 years ago has managed to pull off a daring escape and has been reunited with his family in @entity6			0
no details of how @entity8 , now 68 , managed to escape from the secretive @entity3 but most who have made it across the border - either by land or across a river into @entity14 - risk being shot by guards			1
it was in 1972 when @entity8 was serving as one of 25 crewmen manning two @entity2 boats that they were all captured by @entity3 sailors in the @entity21			1

on his arrival in @entity6 , @entity8 was taken to a safe house by @entity2 security officials and questioned about his life in the enemy @entity3 - what is expected to be the first of a series of debriefings			1

he told her he had risked his life to escape because he missed his family and friends in the @entity2 more and more and wished to spent his remaining years with them and be buried there			0
it is believed that @entity6 's security officials will want to firmly establish that @entity8 has not been indoctrinated with the mind - set of the @entity63 and will take every opportunity to spy on the @entity2			2
