a former @entity1 doctor has been accused of carrying out bungled and unhygienic circumcisions on children at their homes - leaving one baby boy screaming in agony after the anaesthetic wore off half way through the surgery			1
dr @entity10 , 49 , of @entity11 , faces misconduct charges over 47 allegations in relation to four boys that he carried out unhygienic procedures at the homes of four different youngsters as part of a ' private mobile circumcision service '			1
the @entity24 investigation was launched after a complaint by @entity26 and her husband @entity27 , from @entity28 , claiming their 23 - month - old son @entity29 was left ' traumatised ' and suffering an infection because @entity10 did not take hygienic precautions			1
dr @entity10 is accused of carrying out bungled circumcisions at the homes of four baby boys while employed as paediatrician at @entity36 ( pictured ) the allegations span a period from june 2012 until november 2013 , during which time dr @entity10 was employed as a @entity40 in paediatric surgery at @entity36			1
a tribunal heard today that the doctor operated a private mobile children 's circumcision service away from his job at the hospital - but was accused by parents of not washing his hands prior to treatment and at times of not wearing surgical gloves , failing to carry out proper examinations and not having proper resuscitation equipment including oxygen and airway equipment			1
it is claimed that when one little boy suffered an adverse reaction to local anaesthetic @entity10 did not realise he was having a seizure and failed to act immediately to ensure an ambulance was called			1
the tribunal heard during another procedure , a mother became concerned about her baby screaming and asked dr @entity10 questions - but it is alleged he pushed her hand away and said : ' leave him he 's fine			1
' it is alleged he then pretended to take a telephone call to avoid answering further questions			0
after the parent of a third circumcised boy rang @entity10 to say his son was still in pain , it was claimed @entity10 failed to respond and accused him of ' telling lies ' the parents of a fourth boy claim @entity10 carried surgical materials in plastic carrier bags and used baby wipes and paper towels during the procedure , which was of such a poor standard he had to carry out another circumcision on the same child the following day			1
despite the boy suffering injuries from the operation as too much skin was removed , dr @entity10 failed to refer him to a hospital and then ignored his parents when they expressed concerns over his condition , it was claimed			1
doctor @entity10 admits carrying out the procedures but denies that his practices were unhygienic or inadequate in any way ( file image ) following complaints it emerged @entity10 had failing to secure valid insurance for each procedure and failed to register his circumcision service with the @entity106			1
he was initially suspended from his post and stopped carrying out the procedures and has since resigned from the @entity1 and surrendered his @entity24 registration			2
but at the @entity110 said he was contemplating starting up his circumcision business again and he even asked the panel to adjourn the case so he could earn money from the enterprise to fund his legal fees			2
male circumcision is widely practiced in @entity120 communities and is not illegal in @entity121			2
as it is classed as ' consensual assault ' , similar to tattooing , anyone can legally carry it out			0
circumcision is only available through the @entity1 if there are compelling medical reasons , though local gp 's may carry out the operation themselves			2
healthcare workers usually have to be registered with the @entity106 if they want to perform home circumcisions but there is no legal requirement			0
the hearing was previously told the families of the boys from @entity11 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 had wanted their children circumcised for religious or cultural reasons			2
@entity144 , counsel for the @entity24 , said : ' he performed or attempted to perform circumcisions on four infant boys at their homes between june 2012 and november 2013			0
' at the time he was a paediatric surgeon but also in a private capacity operated a mobile children 's circumcision service carrying out circumcisions in the community for parents who wished their sons to undergo them for religious or cultural reasons			1
' having been engaged he would attend their home addresses on the day bringing with him the equipment he needed to carry it out			2
' he would obtain consent on the day and would leave behind information providing advice on aftercare			0
ideally it would be quick and simple - meeting once and moving on			0
' the @entity24 's case is that mr @entity10 's conduct in relation to the four patients fell below the standard required of a doctor carrying out procedures			1
' there was a lack of care when carrying out procedures , a rush to get them done and a lack of appropriate regard and respect for the parents who engaged his services			2
' in relation to patients @entity181 , he failed to obtain properly informed consent			2
while he obtained a signature on a consent form and provided some information , his rush to perform the procedures and impatience in answering questions meant he did not engage properly with them			0
' in october 2012 , he treated @entity193 's mother with a lack of respect , by pushing her hand away when she reacted to @entity193 's scream at having his foreskin pulled back			0
in response to her alarm at his treatment of @entity193 he said to her ' leave him , he 's fine ' , or words to that effect			0
' when questioned by @entity193 's mother about the circumcision , he pretended that he had to take a telephone call to avoid answering her and when questioned further , mr @entity10 said " i 'm not getting into this " and walked out of the house			1
' dr @entity10 also failed to obtain adequate histories of each boy he was performed the procedure , it was said , as well as failing to make sure his equipment was aseptic			1
mr @entity144 added : ' @entity217 appears to have suffered an adverse reaction to anaesthetisation and required an ambulance and emergency medical intervention			0
' mr @entity10 should not have administered a local anaesthetic without access to the minimum resuscitation facilities			2
' he treated parents with a lack of respect - from failing to attend to their concerns to threatening and dishonest behaviour @entity229 was screaming during a procedure , providing an indication that the anaesthetic was not working properly			0
' he should have stopped but he simply carried on			0
' you may hear evidence in the course of the hearing about the benefits of a surgeon providing the circumcision service to those who want it for religious reasons and conducting them at home			1
' it is important to make clear it is not the @entity24 's case that he should not have been carrying out procedures in the home at all , rather that he failed in numerous respects to meet the basic standards that should be expected of any doctor operating in this environment			1
' @entity10 admits carrying out the procedures but denies that his practices were unhygienic or inadequate in any way			1
he said : ' i 've stopped doing circumcisions since i stopped getting correspondence from the @entity106 but i could			0
' i do not need to register with the @entity106 when i 'm suspended but i stopped it for numerous reasons			0
' i still am not doing it but i know i can			0
i can restart doing circumcisions and can finance legal representation			0
i may start and finance the legal side of it			0
' the hearing , expected to last up to four weeks , continues .			0
