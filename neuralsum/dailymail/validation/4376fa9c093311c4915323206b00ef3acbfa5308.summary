the first ‘ significant ’ solar flare of the year has been spotted by a @entity2 observatory			1
the flare peaked at 12.22pm edt ( 4.22pm gmt ) yesterday and was watched by the orbiting @entity4 ( @entity4 )			1
this flare was the most powerful of the year so far , and is predicted to cause a geomagnetic storm on @entity7 tomorrow following blackouts today			1
it was the biggest eruption of the year and peaked at 4.22pm gmt yesterday ( shown ) this flare was classified as an @entity18 flare			1
x-class denotes the most intense flares , while the number provides more information about its strength			0
an @entity24 is twice as intense as an @entity25 , an @entity26 is three times as intense , and so on			0
solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation , but harmful radiation from a flare can not pass through @entity7 's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground			1
however , when intense enough , they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where gps and communications signals travel			0
this flare was emitted from @entity42 12297 ( @entity43 ) on the sun. according to the @entity10 @entity46 ( @entity47 ) in @entity48 , @entity12 , the flare caused an hour - long blackout in some high - frequency radio communications over some areas			1
the flare ( seen in different wavelengths on the left and right ) has already caused radio blackouts on @entity7 and a minor geomagnetic storm could occur tomorrow			1
this flare was emitted from @entity42 12297 ( @entity43 ) on the sun. solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost			1
the charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the @entity7 ’s magnetic field			2
very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies			0
a positive aspect , from an aesthetic point of view , is that the auroras are enhanced			0
geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents			2
‘ an @entity81 peaked at 1622 @entity82 ( 12:22pm edt ) today , march 11 , ’ they said in a statement			2
. ‘ this is yet another significant solar flare from @entity42 12297 as it marches across the solar disk			1
‘ this is the largest flare the region has produced so far , after producing a slew of @entity89 ( @entity90 ) and @entity91 ( @entity92 ) @entity93 over the past few days			0
’ they also note that ejections of material associated with the flare - known as a @entity97 ( @entity97 ) - are predicted to arrive today and tomorrow			2
‘ the combined effects of these storms have prompted a @entity102 ( @entity90 ) geomagnetic storm watch to be issued , with the possibility of additional or upgraded watches if / when additional data can be analysed , ’ they wrote			1
a geomagnetic storm is a temporary disturbance of @entity7 's atmosphere , which can cause communication problems			1
@entity2 ’s @entity4 ( @entity4 ) , illustration shown , was launched on 11 february 2010 and has observed the sun ever since			0
it ’s goal is to understand how exactly the sun interacts with the environment around @entity7			2
it captured the images of this latest large flare according to the @entity10 @entity46 ( @entity47 ) in @entity48 , @entity12 , the flare ( shown ) caused an hour - long blackout in some high - frequency radio communicatiosn over some areas a solar flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released - mostly in the active regions around sunspots			1
their frequency varies from several a day , when the sun is particularly active , to less than one a week during quiet periods			0
radiation is emitted across virtually the entire electromagnetic spectrum , from radio waves at the long wavelength end , through optical emission to x-rays and gamma rays at the short wavelength end			2
the amount of energy released is the equivalent of millions of 100 - megaton hydrogen bombs exploding at the same time			0
solar flares are not to be confused with coronal mass ejections ( @entity145 )			0
the former are the flash of light from the sun , while the latter are the actual emission of material that we often see as ' loops ' coming from the surface			0
while the two often accompany each other , the relationship between them is not entirely understood .			0

space weather experts in @entity12 , @entity10 issued a warning on a solar flare
it was the biggest eruption of the year and peaked 4.22pm gmt yesterday
it has already caused radio blackouts on @entity7 and a minor geomagnetic storm could occur tomorrow
this flare was emitted from @entity42 12297 ( @entity43 ) on the sun
