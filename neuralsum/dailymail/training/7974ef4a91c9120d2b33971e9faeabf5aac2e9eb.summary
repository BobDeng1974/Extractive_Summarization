welcome news : the @entity2 's popularity is at a 15 - year high , according to a new survey for the pro-republican @entity6 newspaper among all the gifts that will be presented to the @entity2 for her @entity9 , perhaps this will be most treasured			1
the monarch ’s popularity is at its highest for at least 15 years , a poll has found , with affection for the @entity14 rising following the @entity15 and @entity16 of @entity18 ’s wedding last year , and ahead of the jubilee			1
sixty - nine per cent believe the country would be worse off without the @entity21			1
only 22 per cent think the opposite , that @entity23 would be better off without them			2
the 47 - point margin between the two positions is the biggest recorded on any of the 12 occasions pollsters @entity27 have asked the question since 1997			1
the results are somewhat ironic given that the poll was commissioned by the traditionally pro-republican @entity6 newspaper			2
support for the @entity2 has risen even since last year			1
when the same question was asked shortly before the @entity33 , 63 per cent said we would be worse off without the @entity2			1
in august 1997 , around the time of princess @entity38 ’s death , that figure stood at 48 per cent			1
despite solid support for the monarch across all ages and classes , the latest poll revealed that the public are anxious about what will happen when the @entity2 ’s reign ends			2
of those surveyed , 39 per cent said they want prince @entity49 to be king			0
reason to be cheerful : affection for royals has risen since the wedding of the @entity15 and @entity16 last year at the time of princess @entity38 's death in 1997 , just 48 per cent said we would be worse off without the @entity2 , compared to 69 per cent now			1
meanwhile , almost half want the crown to skip prince @entity49 and pass straight to prince @entity58 the results of the @entity27 poll commissioned by @entity6 almost half want the crown to skip a generation and pass straight to prince @entity58			0
only 10 per cent said @entity23 should become a republic with an elected head of state when the @entity2 dies or abdicates			0
@entity27 interviewed a random sample of 1,002 adults between may 18 and may 20 for the survey			0
it found that support for the monarchy is at its strongest among older , especially @entity71 voters , 82 per cent of whom are in favour of the @entity21			0
but across every age group and among @entity76 and @entity77 voters alike , the monarchy is enjoying solid support			0
although there is nothing to suggest prince @entity58 would take the crown over his father , the poll reveals that if he did so , he would have the support of the younger , largely @entity76 - voting population			0
surveys on the @entity21 ’s popularity date back to the 1960s , and show that support for the @entity2 has remained remarkably steady			0
even during difficult spells , such as the @entity2 ’s infamous ‘ annus horribilis ’ in 1992 , support for a republic has rarely risen much above 20 per cent .			2
