@entity2 , vulgar , gross and hilarious ... it ’s no surprise @entity4 has legions of fans			1
but even the cartoon 's most devoted followers would run for the hills at the thought of a video game based on the @entity12			2
thankfully , though , all fears are allayed when you see @entity4 : the @entity15 in action			1
just like the cartoon : it looks so good , you 'll often forget you 're playing a game you begin as the new kid in town facing a harrowing challenge : making friends			2
as you start your quest , the children of @entity4 are embroiled in a city - wide , live - action - role - playing game , casting imaginary spells and swinging fake swords			1
over time , the simple children ’s game escalates into a battle of good and evil that threatens to consume the world			2
and from the perilous battlefields of the fourth - grade playground , a young hero will rise , destined to be @entity4 ’s saviour			2
developers @entity40 , best known for their work on @entity43 : the @entity44 , have gone to town in making this as authentic a @entity4 experience as possible			1
@entity49 @entity48 and @entity50 have penned the story and there ’s a real intent to break the poor cartoon - to - game curse			1
you ’ll be able to customise your character with an arsenal of magical weapons and armour			0
take that , sucker : you 'll have to use spells and weapons to battle some vampires plus , with nearly a billion character and clothing combinations , you ’ll actually be able to insert yourself into the cartoon			1
everything from the little ' bobs ' the characters do when they move to their quirky facial expressions has been captured			0
indeed , it almost looks like you ’re watching an episode			0
in a nod to @entity75 and @entity76 , @entity15 is an open - world game			1
characters can level up certain skills , such as magic or weapons , and can choose different classes ( @entity83 , @entity84 , fighter and thief ) in their quest to become ... cool			0
each time you level up , you ’re treated to @entity88 dishing out your ( often rude ) new title			0
combat is turn - based , which will appeal to hardcore @entity93 fans fed of clunky real - time combat often associated with modern games in the genre			0
it ’s refreshing to see a cartoon - to - video - game offering be on course to do a series justice – something movie - game tie - ins just ca n’t seem to do these days			0
you shall not pass ! @entity88 stands firm as archers charge towards him all apart from the recent @entity106 , that is , which sunk in both cinemas and on consoles - the game , in particular , being one of the worst i ’ve played in years			0
can @entity4 do the near impossible and pave the way for quality cartoon and movie video game transitions ? we 'll have to wait until march next year to find out			1
follow @entity115 on @entity116 : @ @entity117 and on @entity118 : @entity119 .			0

make your own character using billions of combinations and ' insert ' him into open world
written by @entity48 and @entity50 to ensure most authentic @entity4 experience ever
looks exactly like the cartoon , and developed by team behind @entity43 and @entity76
