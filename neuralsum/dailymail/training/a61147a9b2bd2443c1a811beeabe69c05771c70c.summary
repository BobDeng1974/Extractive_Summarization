mindfulness is a mental state that can be achieved by focusing on an awareness on the present moment , while calmly acknowledging and accepting one 's feelings			1
the practice was reserved only for ' hippy ' and ' bohemian ' types , but thanks to stars like @entity12 and @entity13 , it has become synonymous with success , fortune and , quite frankly , all things cool			1
many credit the simple form of meditation with helping them to manage daily life and even land a job - but can it help you lose weight ? well , two women certainly think so - and they 've even created a diet based around the @entity28 practice			0
the duo claim their new book teaches readers how to tune into their bodies and eat the foods they really need to achieve their ideal weight			1
the book blurb reads : ' mindfulness is the new attitude to living			1
' taking an attitude of mindful awareness to eating will not only help you appreciate every mouthful , but reward you with a whole new way to eat that banishes any former food issues			1
' there is no dieting , calorie - counting or fasting , by simply changing your approach to feeding yourself , you can tune in to your body wisdom and begin to eat less of what you do n’t need , while filling up on nourishing foods that help you reach the weight you ’ll be happy with for life			0
' chapters include myths and risks of extreme diets , tips on how to recognise your eating habits and understand your real food needs , plus mindfulness meditations , 70 recipes and mindful eating plans			1
promoting : @entity38 , a psychotherapist , mindfulness teacher and stress management consultant has teamed up with @entity41 , a mindfulness - based cognitive therapist , to create @entity44 , right @entity38 said : ' by not being mindful with our " true hunger " , we tend to eat more , when having less could be what is needed			1
' by becoming mindful we develop understanding , and in this process we become more forgiving and kinder to ourselves			1
' they promise their approach will help readers ' release themselves from the grip of shame and anger ' and ' replace it with understanding '			0
they claim mindfulness helps people accept the fact that they can not change the basic frame of their body but can still find their ideal weight and have a healthy appreciation of their body			1
be mindful : all too often we just grab a sandwich in front of our computer for lunch or eat in front of the tv at night			1
sometimes we do n't even notice what we have eaten , say nutritionists it can also apparently helps you learn what an ideal portion size is			0
the pair instruct readers to carry out basic meditation practices like the body scan , which involves closing your eyes and focusing on different areas of the body to engage in a friendly relationship with our physique			0
other practises include analysing your food when preparing , cooking and eating it			1
the book advises users to pay special attention to the ingredients ' colour , smell and texture , which heightens the eating experience			1
recipes in the £ 7.99 book include layered nutty bars and home baked beans for breakfast , roasted peppers with quinoa or falafel pitta pockets for lunch and salmon and bulgar wheat pilaf for dinner			1
as well as writing the book , which goes on sale in january , @entity38 and @entity41 are developing mindful eating weekend courses that will run in the @entity157			1
so how did mindfulness become so hip and the relaxation method of choice for countless celebrities ? @entity12 is undoubtedly the postergirl for positive living - she has even penned two self - help books , @entity165 and @entity166 , packed with uplifting affirmations , while @entity13 says the practice helps her get through the day			1
and it 's not just supermodels and fashionistas at it			0
@entity31 , who established the hugely successful @entity173 , credits daily mindfulness and meditation for changing her life			1
ministers are even considering introducing lessons in mindfulness			2
schools minister @entity180 said evidence suggested the sessions could help boost pupils ’ attitudes and motivation			0
but can it be applied to weight loss ? @entity188 , @entity189 at @entity190 , said : ' the mindfulness diet is all about being aware of what you are eating			1
i love the approach but i think to call it a diet is incorrect			0
' being mindful of what you eat is a great practice to follow			2
all too often we just grab a sandwich in front of our computer for lunch or eat in front of the tv at night			0
sometimes we do n’t even notice what we have eaten			0
' inspired by ancient @entity28 meditation , mindfulness courses were developed in the late 1970s by @entity212 doctors to combat stress			2
the therapies aim to help people live more ‘ in the moment ’ and spend less time going over past stresses and worrying about future problems			0
techniques include moving the focus of attention around the body and observing sensations that arise – the so - called ‘ body scan ’			0
others involve concentrating on breathing or completing yoga - style movements and observing sensations in moments of movement and stillness			0
mindfulness is said to help people recognise and overcome negative thoughts while noticing small pleasures around them			1
although some regard it with scepticism , studies appear to show a clinical benefit for treating a range of mental health problems			0
thousands of mindfulness sessions are prescribed to @entity245 patients every year to help treat anxiety and depression			2
celebrity adherents of the now secular practice include @entity252 actresses @entity250 and @entity253			0
she continued : ' before you even eat , take time to think about whether you are actually hungry or not			0
' quite often you are n’t hungry but just eating because the food is there			1
' when you think about why you are eating , you may find out that there are emotional or physical triggers rather than just pure hunger			2
' when you do eat , savour every mouthful and take time to eat			0
notice the colours and flavours			0
give yourself time to really enjoy your food			2
this will make you aware of what you are eating and also make you eat a bit slower which will help your digestive system cope			2
' eating slowly also gives your body time to release a hormone called cholecystokinin ( @entity274 )			2
' this hormone tells the brain that you are full			0
it takes time to be released though ( usually around 20 minutes ) so eating slowly gives the body time to release this hormone therefore resulting you in finishing eating when you are full – not when your plate is empty			2
' time yourself eating your lunch - i bet it does n’t take 20 minutes ! ' overall , this is a practice we would encourage but would n’t call it a diet			0
