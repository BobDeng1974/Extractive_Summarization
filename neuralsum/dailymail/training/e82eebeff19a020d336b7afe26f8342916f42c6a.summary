by @entity0 @entity1 is at the center of the racism scandal surrounding the @entity5 owner but new reports reveal that he may be plotting a bigger role in the eventual ending			1
the former @entity10 superstar is reportedly vying for a chance to own the @entity5 himself , and is hoping that the recording that features the team 's current owner @entity13 making racist comments about african - americans may help @entity1 get back in the game			1
' @entity19 's absolutely interested , ' a @entity10 source told @entity20			2
new leadership ? @entity1 is reportedly interested in buying the @entity5 amid the racism scandal surrounding the team 's coach , @entity13 the retired player is the most famous member of @entity26 , a financial services firm worth hundreds of billions of dollars , and has worked with them to buy professional sports teams in the past			1
this would n't be the first time that @entity1 and @entity26 bought an area team , as they paid $ 2.15billion for the @entity34 in 2012			2
more recently , they tried to buy the @entity36 but the @entity38 family that owns the team refused a sale			0
the investment group made another big buy in february , effectively bailing out the area 's women 's basketball team , the @entity44 , when it was about to fold			2
analysts have speculated that the move was n't so much out of equal opportunity goodwill , but really in an effort to get on the good side of the @entity10 administrators in order to make a future purchase of a men 's team more likely			0
' this is 100 per cent @entity19 's plan , ' an anonymous league official told @entity58			1
tirade : the recording stemmed from a conversation between @entity13 and his girlfriend @entity62 ( right ) after she posted this photo with @entity1 to her @entity66 account not quite a reality : @entity13 ( left ) can not be forced into a sale by the team or the @entity10 but @entity1 ( right ) and his investment team have a history of buying local sports franchises the fact that @entity1 has already been an unintended character in the racism scandal just makes the hypothetical solution fit even more nicely			1
the controversial recording was released over the weekend and is believed to show @entity13 condemning his girlfriend @entity62 for posting a picture of she and @entity1 on her @entity66 feed			0
he goes on in lengthy recording , telling her : ' do n't put him ( @entity1 ) on an @entity66 for the world to have to see so they have to call me			0
and do n't bring him to my games			0
' a sale to @entity1 and the @entity87 is far from a done deal , however , as there is no way that the @entity5 organization can oust @entity13 , who bought the team for $ 12million in 1981			1
owner 's spot : @entity1 and his financial partners bought the @entity34 baseball team for $ 2.15billion in 2012 and he is a regular at the games ( at the 2014 season opener and at right a week later ) the @entity99 suggests that given the current climate of overpaying for relatively - unknown teams , the current pricetag for the @entity5 could be boosted from $ 575million to $ 1billion			1
that leaves any and all action in the hands of the @entity10 which can really only issue fines and temporary penalties but can not force him to give up the team			0
' if the owners ca n't force ( @entity113 ) to sell , they need to be held accountable to change the bylaws so they can , ' an unidentified member of the @entity10 's board of governors told @entity58			0
' a fine and suspension is meaningless , and that 'll be seen as a lack of acceptance that the league and owners are responsible for this a * * * * * *			0

@entity1 and his investment partners have a history of buying @entity126 - area sports teams but has yet to purchase an @entity10 franchise
already owns the @entity34 and helped the @entity130 save face earlier this year by bailing out the local women 's team when they were about to fold
' this is 100 per cent @entity19 's plan , ' a source said
however , no way to force scandal - *plagued* owner @entity13 into selling the team
he bought the @entity5 for $ 12million in 1981 but is now *valued* between $ *500million* and $ 1billion
