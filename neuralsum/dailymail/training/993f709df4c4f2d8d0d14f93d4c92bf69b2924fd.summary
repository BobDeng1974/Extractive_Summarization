around 150 women have formed the katiba - which means battalion or phalanx in @entity13 - which is playing a major role in the fighting , according to a monitoring group			1

members of the only all - female katiba in @entity8 fighting beside the @entity20 , standing inside a secret command outpost the formation of the women 's battalion was announced in @entity31 , the scene in late 2012 of violence ' the @entity19 popular committees have set up the first women 's battalion , comprising some 150 women fighters			1
the battalion is named the @entity38 , ' said the @entity39 , which opposes the regime			1
' while women are now fighting alongside the rebels , pro-regime forces and @entity19 militia , this is the first women 's battalion as such , ' said @entity39 director @entity47			1
' women are now playing a major role in the fighting in @entity6 , ' he said			2
the formation of the women 's battalion was announced in @entity31 , the scene in late 2012 of violence pitting @entity19 fighters against @entity56 rebels fighting the regime of president @entity58			1
@entity58 's troops pulled out from majority @entity19 areas in 2012 , and while @entity61 have been split over the anti-regime revolt in @entity6 , most have chosen to remain neutral in the conflict			0
an agreement in @entity65 on the @entity67 border brought an end to fighting between @entity61 and @entity70 rebels , though some activists have described the agreement brokered by a prominent @entity74 dissident as fragile			2
ready for war : the katiba , made up of mostly @entity19 women , is fighting beside the @entity20 the announcement of the @entity19 women 's battalion comes a month after pro-regime forces set up the @entity81 , a paramilitary unit in which women of all ages have been asked to volunteer			1
anti-regime activists have also distributed images of women fighters joining rebel ranks			0
' women are fighting on all the fronts now , though it 's possibly the @entity70 rebel ranks that have the fewest women taking part in them , ' the @entity39 's @entity47 said			2
a female activist in the coastal province of @entity95 said women often transport weapons and supplies for rebels as they are less likely to be searched at army and security checkpoints			0
troops loyal to @entity58 and rebels have been locked in a deadly stalemate in @entity8 , @entity6 's largest urban center and main commercial hub , since an opposition assault last summer			1
eight months later , the rebels hold large parts of the city and its outskirts , including several army bases			0
but they have been unable to overcome the regime 's far superior firepower			0
uprising : members of the @entity20 chant slogans against @entity6 president @entity58 in @entity117 , @entity8 a defaced poster of @entity6 's president @entity58 is seen near garbage containers in @entity8 a @entity20 fighter takes cover during clashes with @entity20 in the @entity125 neighbourhood of central @entity8 today , @entity6 's government and rebels both demanded an international investigation into an alleged chemical weapons attack , as the country 's feared arsenal became the latest propaganda tool in the two - year - old civil war			1
president @entity134 said the @entity135 is investigating whether chemical weapons have been deployed in @entity6 , but noted that he is ' deeply sceptical ' of claims by president @entity58 's regime that rebel forces were behind such an attack			0
' once we establish the facts , i have made clear that the use of chemical weapons is a game changer , ' @entity134 said in a news conference with @entity149 prime minister @entity148 in @entity150			0
the use of chemical weapons by either side is a nightmare scenario			0
along with its warnings about @entity58 , the @entity155 is just as concerned that rebel forces , including some linked to @entity158 , could get their hands on @entity6 's chemical weapons supplies			0
despite the importance , any clear confirmation of the nature of the attack that took place on tuesday in the northern village of @entity166 , killing at least 31 people , is unlikely			0
@entity6 's government seals off areas it controls to journalists and outside observers			0
the two sides blamed each other for a chemical attack without offering clear proof or documentation , as has frequently been the case in the @entity6 civil war			2
if confirmed , it would be the first time a chemical weapon has been used in @entity6 's war that has already killed an estimated 70,000 people .			2

around 150 formed a katiba , meaning battalion or phalanx in @entity13
they are fighting beside the @entity20 in war - torn @entity8
