by @entity0 published : 15:59 est , 19 february 2013 updated : 07:39 est , 20 february 2013 a @entity2 woman is fighting to save a @entity4 rainforest from an oil company after marrying the leader of the local tribe			1
@entity8 , a mother - of - one from south @entity9 , met @entity10 , a @entity11 tribe shaman , during a trip to @entity13 in 2008 where he wooed her with a poisonous frog			1
the couple immediately felt they were ' destined ' to be together and settled down in his ancestral home where they now run an eco-tourism lodge			0
but the rainforest is under threat from @entity23 , @entity13 ’s state - owned oil company , which recently offered £ 400,000 for access to the 170 acres of land			1
forest fighter : londoner @entity8 and her @entity13 husband @entity10 , a @entity11 tribe shaman , are fighting to save their tribe 's rainforest from oil company ms @entity8 and her husband are two of 400 members of the @entity11 tribe living on the banks of @entity13 ’s @entity36 , where the 49 - year - old and her husband married in 2010			1
ms @entity8 , who used to run a go - kart circuit in @entity40 , has 18 - month - old daughter @entity41 by @entity10 and wore a dress made out of tree bark for her wedding			2
despite their ecotourism project currently relying on ms @entity8 's life - savings , the pair are heading a campaign to save mr @entity10 's ancestral territory , travelling by canoe from home to home to try and convince the members of their community to turn down the offer			2
in exchange for access to the land , @entity23 has promised the community a new school , grant funding for their children to go to university , healthcare , jobs and lump sums of cash , a lucrative deal for the struggling tribe			0
save the forest : the community runs an eco-tourism lodge in the rainforest , but as it currently fails to make a profit the tribe may not have a choice but to sell to the oil company under threat : @entity81 , an oil company owned by the @entity13 state , have offered £ 400,000 for the access to the picturesque forest trying to convince the community to turn away from these promises is no mean feat , mr @entity10 wrote in @entity89 last year , especially with the current financial state of the @entity92 lodge , but the pair are determined to save the forest			1
in a heart - wrenching first - person piece , mr @entity10 wrote : ' we have protected these lands with our hearts , soul and lives since before we can remember			2
' the modern world is advancing faster than we as a people can cope with , but we know that education is key and there is a need for money too			0
even in the rainforest we now need money for schooling and to sustain ourselves to start projects such as an organic fruit farm			0
community : the couple are part of the @entity11 tribe living by the @entity36 in @entity117 , @entity13 ' the oil companies have made great in - roads this time , they have found our people at an all - time low emotionally and financially , and have seized their chance			2
how can we help the community give up such wonderful opportunities ? ' but he goes on to say that he and his wife will continue to fight to save the community and encourage them to find other means of sustaining themselves			0
‘ by supporting themselves through ecotourism the @entity11 community have thus far been able to fight off the constant pressure from oil company representatives to give in to the financial temptation that comes with the billions of dollars ’ worth of oil that their land contains , ' ms @entity8 wrote on the @entity92 website			1
‘ the knock on effect of allowing the oil companies in would be catastrophic for both the people of @entity145 and the rest of the world , but they are running out of time and options			0
' times of change : the community by the @entity36 has been struggling to survive in recent years after hundreds of years of being self - sustaining			0
