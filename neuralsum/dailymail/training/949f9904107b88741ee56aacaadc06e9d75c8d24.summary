by @entity0 published : 10:38 est , 14 august 2012 updated : 15:31 est , 14 august 2012 a retired lorry driver has spent four years painstakingly recreating a ' wildly expensive ' copy of the doomed @entity4 's wireless room			1
the iconic @entity6 liner plunged to the bottom of the @entity8 after striking an iceberg on its maiden voyage on april 14 , 1912 , resulting in the loss of 1,502 passengers and crew			2
the @entity15 wireless room , which was used to send distress signals during the terrifying sea tragedy , has now gone on show at @entity19 , @entity20 , for three months			1

the original : this is a picture of the ship 's original radio room , taken by @entity28 on april 12 , just 48 hours before the great liner sank attention to detail : @entity32 is seen here with his astonishing labour of love - a perfectly recreated @entity4 room retired lorry driver @entity32 , 71 , of nearby @entity36 , embarked on a labour of love to produce the early 20th century maritime communications centre			1
the @entity4 enthusiast said : ' it has been a real labour of love because the parts are wildly expensive			0
' where possible i have used original pieces from the time			0
' mr @entity32 bought most of the items for his incredibly lifelike replica by trawling through @entity48 including a silver plated brass lamp dredged up from the seabed near the doomed ship			1
some 12 copies of a brass handle with an original @entity6 design were also made for the desk			1
back to life : mr @entity32 spent years looking through @entity48 to find the most realistic - and sometimes genuine - pieces for his replica unthinkable : mr @entity32 said : ' it has been a real labour of love because the parts are wildly expensive ' @entity63 and @entity64 , which had a large foundry in @entity66 , made the original handle and @entity63 was the grandfather of late popular author @entity68			2
at the time of the catastrophe the cutting edge equipment in the wireless room , which sent @entity72 , was state - of - the - art and was mostly made from wood or brass			1
mr @entity32 said : ' while the system had been used for eight years , the shipping companies did n't take it that seriously to exchange information about icebergs			2
' it was not part of their safety system			0
' what they liked about it was the well - off clients could send messages from the ship to the shore			2
' it would be quite pricey			0
' the retired lorry driver spent a painstaking four years collecting the pieces , including a silver plated brass lamp dredged up from the seabed @entity98 , seen here , the junior radio operator , desperately sent out @entity101 pleas for help from the wireless room sending a message from the @entity4 's wireless room on the boat deck cost 12/6d for the first 10 words and 9d for each word after that			1
at today 's prices , an average @entity110 would cost a staggering Â£ 50 to dispatch			0
mr @entity32 's faithful display was inspired by a photograph taken by first class passenger the @entity115 @entity28			1
mr @entity28 got on at @entity116 before disembarking at @entity117 , @entity118 , now called @entity117			0
the @entity120 priest was staying on ' a ' deck and took pictures around the ship , including the wireless room at 10.10am , on april 12			1

mr @entity125 was killed but mr @entity98 miraculously survived			0
@entity4 's sister ship , the @entity133 , responded , but was too far away and the @entity134 , a passenger steamship , arrived four hours after disaster struck			1
mr @entity32 said terrified radio operators fired off more than 20 signals as the ' unsinkable ' 46,000 ton giant foundered south of @entity140			0
a back - up system which ran from batteries was used after the power supply failed 30 minutes before the @entity4 sank			2
thrilled @entity144 , heritage development officer for @entity19 , said : ' i think the display is amazing			2
' it is a huge undertaking because @entity32 has got it so right and i admire him for doing that			0
' the @entity4 leaving @entity116 on her ill - fated maiden voyage on april 10 , 1912 she added : ' it is a lovely tribute to people who were lost on the @entity4 and @entity32 's encyclopaedic knowledge compliments it			0
' the wireless room featured in the @entity4 exhibition at the @entity158 in @entity159 in april to mark the @entity161 disaster 's centenary and briefly at @entity161 , @entity20			1
mr @entity32 , who has been bewitched by the @entity4 since he was a schoolboy , said : ' the disaster was a bit of a turning point			0
