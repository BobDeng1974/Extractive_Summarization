by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 21:37 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 06:06 est , 21 august 2013 the @entity3 administration convened a cabinet - level meeting tuesday afternoon to decide whether @entity6 military aid to @entity7 will continue , just hours after an aide to a @entity10 senator told a reporter the aid had already been placed on a temporary hold			1
the @entity6 is on schedule to provide @entity7 , the most populous nation in the @entity16 world , with about $ 1.5 billion in various aid packages , a majority of which is in the form of aid to the nation 's military			1
' @entity28 's @entity27 meeting on @entity7 started on time , at 2:30pm , ' a @entity25 pool reporter wrote at 4:15pm			2
' it 's unclear whether pool will have [ an ] end time			0
' supply : the @entity6 provides @entity7 with military equipment as part of a $ 1.3bn foreign aid program on tuesday a staffer in the office of @entity39 @entity10 senator @entity38 told @entity40 that most military aid and weapons deliveries to @entity7 had been halted by the administration , along with civilian economic aid			1
but the @entity25 quickly denied those reports , saying no decision had been reached			0
its afternoon meeting of top brass marks a critical moment in the history of @entity6 - @entity7 relations			1
the @entity3 administration 's choice of whether to cancel future military aid will be seen as a sign that the @entity25 is choosing sides in the urban warfare that has claimed the lives of more than 1,000 so far			1
@entity60 protesters are demanding a return to power by former president @entity63 and the @entity64			0
a military coup seized power on july 3			0
the @entity25 has taken pains to avoid calling it a coup , however , as that designation would have forced the government to cut off aid immediately			0
the @entity72 , which dates back to 1961 , declares that funds allocated to foreign countries become an option exercise if the target nation 's ' duly elected head of government is deposed by military coup or decree '			0
presidents since then have displayed great flexibility in interpreting that language , however , despite the lack of a written exception in the law for national security emergencies			0
the @entity3 administration understands that @entity6 interests are served by maintaining a working relationship with @entity7 's politically powerful armed forces			1
but in addition to a desire to avoid being the administration that ' lost ' @entity7 , @entity3 's senior team wants the administration to seem outraged by the military 's attacks on @entity97 protesters			2
most @entity6 aid comes in the form of cash transfers to @entity6 military contractors , who then produce and deliver small arms and heavy equipment , including the @entity106 tank , the @entity108 fighter jet and the @entity110 assault rifle			2
aid : cash transfers are given to military contractors who deliver equipment such as @entity116 helicopters order : tanks , such as this one pictured guarding @entity120 , are also supplied in addition to those weapons , @entity6 defense contractors provide training and spare parts , requiring constant contact with military officers in @entity7			1
it 's that contact , experts say , that allows the @entity6 to give the @entity7 a westernized frame of reference - one that 's favorable to the @entity6			2
@entity132 is the only nation to get more @entity6 aid than @entity7 since the end of the 1940s			1
through 2011 , the @entity6 had committed $ 71.6bn in military and economic aid to maintaining good @entity6 - @entity7 relations and peace between @entity7 and @entity139 published a list of some of the weapons packs that have been included : 125 @entity143 : $ 1.3 billion in @entity144 : @entity145 ; @entity146 ; @entity148 f - 16 fighter @entity147 : $ 3.2 billion in @entity149 : @entity150 : $ 210 million in @entity151 : @entity152 , 900 anti-armor @entity153 : $ 319 million in @entity154 : @entity155 : $ 820 million in @entity149 : @entity153 : $ 51 million in @entity149 : @entity156 : $ 308 million in @entity149 : @entity157 , 000 @entity158 : $ 99 million in @entity159 : @entity160 : $ 167 million in @entity154 : @entity161 ' we want them to be addicted to @entity6 military technology because that gives us leverage , ' @entity163 expert and national security columnist @entity162 told @entity170			1
' our equipment requires lots of ongoing training -- think aircraft avionics -- whereas the @entity177 stuff , for instance , does n't require as much			0
military - to - military contact creates a military culture that 's friendlier to the rule of law and democracy			0
' informal contact between military officers can be more productive , over time , than diplomatic summits			0
' in addition , the @entity6 is delivering aid to @entity7 in part to buy preferential access to the @entity189 and military jet flyover rights			1
the two countries ' relationship dates to 1979 , when president @entity193 brought @entity7 and @entity132 together with pledges of peace from both , and economic aid from the @entity199 present , the $ 1.5 billion in aid to @entity7 is the @entity6 ' fourth - largest such commitment			1
@entity132 gets $ 3 billion each year ; @entity202 receives $ 2.1 billion ; and the @entity6 sends @entity203 $ 1.7 billion			2
if the @entity25 were to decide to forgo the benefits it receives and pull back its aid packages , it 's unlikely the @entity7 military would feel any kind of budget pinch			2
@entity210 promised monday that it would make up for any shortfall @entity7 's military had as a result of western nations canceling their commitments			2
the @entity210 already provide the bulk of a $ 12 billion annual aid package from wealthy @entity16 countries			1
and killing what amounts to a make - work program for favored military contractors - @entity7 , according to an august 8 @entity223 analysis , already has more heavy weaponry than it needs - would cost @entity6 jobs			2
a manager at @entity227 told @entity170 on background that while @entity7 's acquisitions of @entity6 hardware is n't the difference between any one company 's life or death , the total of military aid to foreign countries represents a significant part of their business			1
' there are companies that would lay off 500 to 1,000 people if the government stopped subsidizing all this equipment to overseas			0
' mr @entity162 said another reason to be wary of disconnecting with @entity7 's military leaders is that recent history shows the @entity6 can find itself in a predicament if it tries to intervene later for national security reasons			1
unrest : a military checkpoint in @entity120 checks vehicles after a curfew was imposed ' when we disengaged from the @entity203 in the 1990s , all the military - to - military contact declined , ' he recalled			0
' but after 9/11 - after just a decade or so - the military leaders there suddenly were @entity256 , bearded , different			0
working with them became much more challenging			0
the same thing could happen in @entity7			0

$ 1.5 billion *due* to go to @entity7 leaders as part of @entity6 aid package
meeting comes as more than 1,000 die in @entity120 's ' urban warfare '
