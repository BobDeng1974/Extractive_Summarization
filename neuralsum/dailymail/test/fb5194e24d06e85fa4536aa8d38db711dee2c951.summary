archaeologists have uncovered a ritual burial of 2,000 - year - old human skulls - sparking the theory they could be the remains of @entity6 's rebels - as the @entity8 excavations continue			1
the latest discovery of cremated human bones packed neatly into a cooking pot and set off at the side of the historic @entity13 , in @entity8 , has experts questioning whether they were part of a gruesome ceremony			1
when about 20 skulls were found buried in clusters in the sediment of the historic tributary in 2013 it had been thought that they had got there down stream after being eroded out of a @entity26 cemetery to the north - but new evidence suggests otherwise			1
a piece of @entity26 figurative pottery ( right ) was also dug up during searches of the site digging for history : a cross-section of the @entity26 roadside ditch uncovered at @entity36 station the estimated age of the human remains and the way they appear to have been disposed of has led to the suggestion that the bones could even be @entity6 's rebels			1
scientific tests are continuing on the cremated remains , with the possibility the grim ritual theory may be confirmed and that most of the seven skulls found so far are heads of executed criminals and rebels			1
a spokesman for @entity8 confirmed the team was working up a number of theories			0
he said : ' we do n't have any answers yet but we are looking into it			0

the revolt resulted in @entity82 , now @entity83 , @entity8 , and @entity84 , now @entity85 , being burnt to the ground while thousands of people on both sides lost their lives			0
