a circular metal antenna nicknamed ' the elephant cage ' used to intercept radio signals during the @entity3 - era will be torn down after 50 years of taking up space at @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8			1
as part of a mission to get rid of items they no longer need , the @entity9 will dispose of the 1,300 - foot - diameter contraptions known officially as the @entity15			1
wullenweber technology and the finer facts about its creation remain a bit of a mystery as do many details kept secret by the @entity3 - era			1
the mysterious structures were peppered all over the world as a means of intercepting enemy radio signals from @entity27 all the way to the @entity29			0
no more : beachgoers will say goodbye this month to the ' elephant cage ' -- the mysterious metal structure that has graced the south end of the @entity6 for 50 years @entity34 : the elephant cage at @entity36 was used in the late 80s to source electronic signal intelligence related to on - site nuclear weapons inspections @entity39 : the view of an ' elephant cage ' from the @entity42 / sledding hill one of the few known facts about @entity45 contraptions is that they were developed in @entity47 during @entity48 ' it ’s possible that the @entity6 antenna is the last of its kind still standing ' , said @entity52 , a @entity9 historian assigned to the project			1
it ’s been obsolete since the 1970s , reported @entity55			1
a circular antenna was originally used to intercept and detect the location of various radio signals			0
the reason the atenna is so big is so that it can have antennae listening in all directions			0
' it listened in a lot of directions at once			0
so , instead of turning around to look for a signal — which is what a lot of systems did — it listened in all directions , ' said a the naval analyst			0
' so whatever comes in , it ’s likely to pick up , ” he said			0
“ and that was a very big deal			0
' @entity55 reports that the antenna at @entity6 had a range of 3,200 nautical miles and likely searched for signals in @entity80 , the @entity81 , and parts of @entity83			1
@entity85 states such as @entity86 and @entity87 were n't the only homes for these gigantic ' elephant cages			2
' @entity87 : @entity45 or @entity90 at @entity91 , @entity87 @entity39 : an aerial view of @entity93 with the ' elephant cage ' circular disposed antenna array in the background @entity85 allies like the @entity34 had an ' elephant cage ' used to track signals coming from the @entity100 and from the @entity102 pact nations in @entity27			1
another group of contraptions were located in @entity105 at the @entity108 dei @entity106 to intercept signals coming from the @entity29			2
there were also antenna in @entity47 , @entity39 , @entity112 , and the @entity113			2
a @entity115 array in @entity36 was dismantled following base closure in 1996 and the @entity108 array was dismantled following base closure in 1993			0
the structure was used in the late 80s in @entity120 to source electronic signal intelligence related to on - site nuclear weapons inspections @entity42 , @entity39 's @entity124 ’s massive @entity3 - era network of ' elephant cages ' were dismantled in 2013			1
even though the @entity9 is tearing down the structure itself , it will memorialize the structure by keeping the five tallest screens and some wires and anchorage posts			2
they are also working on building digital 3 - d model of the antenna .			0

the @entity9 will get rid of the ' elephant cage ' at @entity6 in @entity137 officially called the @entity15
wullenweber technology and its creation remains a bit of a mystery as do many details kept secret by the @entity3 - era
wullenweber contraptions were developed in @entity47 during @entity48
