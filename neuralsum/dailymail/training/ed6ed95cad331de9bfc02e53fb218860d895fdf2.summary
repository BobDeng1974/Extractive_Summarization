by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:08 est , 11 april 2012 updated : 09:56 est , 12 april 2012 @entity2 believes he and his fellow @entity3 should be forced to publish their tax returns - but suggested this new transparency should not be extended to his own highly - paid lawyer wife and other politicians ' spouces			1
the deputy prime minister said he would be happy to publish his own ‘ rather boring ’ tax return to reassure voters that he was subject to the same rules as everyone else			1
but he suggested his wife @entity15 , a high - flying @entity16 lawyer and the director of a @entity19 building firm , who is likely to earn much more than the £ 134,565 her husband earns , was off limits			1
big earners : @entity2 with his wife @entity15 , pictured flying the flag for her husband 's party in a yellow dress last september , who is a top @entity16 lawyer			1
mr @entity2 said that only @entity3 themselves should publish tax returns he was asked on @entity30 if his wife would have to make her earnings public			1
mr @entity2 repolied : ‘ the principle needs to be a simple one – us politicians , as servants of the public – should make our own arrangements transparent			1
' but i do n’t think we should necessarily call on other people to do that			2
’ mr @entity2 's @entity19 - born wife @entity15 , who has kept her maiden name of @entity44 , is a fiercely independent woman although her income is unknown , the mother - of - three has had a glittering career in the legal profession and is likely to earn a large six - figure salary			1
she is a partner of @entity52 law firm @entity50 , where she works as the head of the @entity55 at their offices in the @entity58			2
handsome home : @entity2 and his wife live in this £ 1.5million @entity62 property in @entity63 , south - west @entity64 before that she spent six years working for legal giants @entity68			1
since 2010 , she has also been a non-executive director of @entity69 , the @entity19 renewable energy infrastructure projects and water management conglomerate			2
the couple live in a large detached @entity62 house in @entity63 , south - west @entity64 , worth an estimated £ 1.5million			1
they also have use of two luxury houses on the continent			0
his parents @entity80 and @entity81 own a 20 - room chalet in the @entity84 mountain resort of @entity85 and a chateau and a 10 - room chateau in south - western @entity88			1
despite @entity90 warnings that the move would fuel the politics of ‘ envy ’ , mr @entity2 suggested that all mps should publish their tax returns as ‘ a matter of principle ’			1
his comments go much further than prime minister @entity99 and chancellor @entity100 who have suggested that any transparency drive would be limited to senior ministers			1
speaking at an event in @entity64 ’s @entity104 , mr @entity2 said : ‘ i have got no principle objection to greater transparency by politicians of their tax return			1
luxury : the 20 - room @entity112 chalet in @entity85 , @entity84 , owned by @entity2 's mother @entity113 @entity114 : @entity116 's 10 - room mansion in south - western @entity88 ' i think you would probably find mine rather boring – i earned one salary and paid tax on it , and that ’s it			1
it ’s a matter of public record already			0
’ ministers have also come under pressure to say whether they benefited from the decision in the budget to reduce the top rate of income tax from 50p to 45p for those earning more than £ 150,000			2
the calls have intensified in recent days following claims that @entity136 ’s @entity64 mayoral candidate @entity135 channelled his earnings through a company to minimise his tax bill			0
mr @entity100 indicated last week that the government was considering whether ministers , including the prime minister , should be more transparent about personal tax			1
the move would be unprecedented for a sitting prime minister			0
mr @entity99 believes that people seeking the ‘ highest office ’ should expect such scrutiny			1
yesterday he said he was ‘ very relaxed ’ about the idea , which he said looked ‘ increasingly likely ’ to take place			0
@entity2 said that politicians are ' servants of the public , therefore the public has the right to know ' about their tax returns in a swipe at @entity159 , the prime minister said he had never done anything that could be regarded as avoiding tax – unlike people who failed to pay vat			2
the @entity164 business secretary ran into trouble last year when it emerged he had been fined £ 500 for an outstanding £ 10,000 tax bill			2
@entity168 dem business secretary @entity159 ran into trouble last year when it emerged he had been fined for an outstanding £ 10,000 tax bill sources have previously suggested that any publication would be limited to the tax affairs of mr @entity99 , mr @entity100 , mr @entity2 and foreign secretary @entity175			1
it is unclear how much detail , if any , will eventually be published			0
but tax expert @entity178 , of the campaign group @entity180 , yesterday warned that even full publication of ministers ’ tax returns would give little idea of whether they were dodging tax			0
mr @entity178 said : ‘ a great deal of tax avoidance is n’t seen on the tax return itself			0
one of the first objectives of the tax avoider is to make sure that their income is not theirs as far as the revenue is concerned – they may move it into a company , or offshore			0
just publishing the tax return wo n’t tell the whole story			0
’ and @entity90 mp @entity202 warned that publication of @entity3 ’ tax affairs risked fuelling envy among voters			0
and he urged ministers to focus instead on making public the tax affairs of major corporations accused of avoiding millions in tax			0
mr @entity202 , chairman of the all - party group on tax , said : ‘ the problem is not me , or @entity3 – what is much more important is companies and corporations and very wealthy individuals			0
‘ if you publish the tax returns of people willy - nilly across the @entity221 then i think you will get the envy factor and jealousy			2
’ mr @entity2 ’s comments came as he revealed that senior figures from all three main parties began talks yesterday on political funding following a string of scandals			2
he said : ‘ party funding scandals have blighted all parties – no party is purer than the driven snow			0
’ publishing the tax returns of politicians would not necessarily give any idea of the scale of their assets , experts warned			2
chancellor @entity100 , for example , is a beneficiary of a trust that is reported to be worth £ 4million , which would not appear on his tax return			1
ministers ’ salaries , which are already in the public domain , would be on the tax return			0
they also give limited information on the income received from savings , shareholdings , property lettings and trusts			0
but the true scale of their wealth would remain secret			0
because mr @entity100 currently receives no income from his trust , it would not be listed on his tax return			1
the offices of @entity99 and @entity2 said that neither of them are beneficiaries of trust funds			1
senior ministers have come under pressure to provide more detail about their affairs following the decision to cut the top rate of tax for people earning more than £ 150,000			1
mr @entity99 is believed to pay the top rate , which was cut from 50p to 45p in the @entity276 , but mr @entity100 has said he does not			1
mr @entity2 has also indicated that he is not a top earner			0
the prime minister does , however , receive thousands of pounds a year by renting out his @entity280 home while living in grace - and - favour apartments in @entity282			2
but he is allowed to offset it against a mortgage – making it hard to work out how much cash he receives			0
accountant @entity178 , founder of the campaign group @entity180 , said that even if the returns were published in full they would not reveal whether politicians were using the numerous loopholes to avoid tax			2
he added : ‘ it would tell us that some people have higher incomes than others and that some people have investments			0
but it will not tell us who is tax avoiding and who is not			0
‘ if someone is doing something they should n’t be they can get round it and it will never appear on a tax return			0

*declaration* goes further than *pm* @entity99 and chancellor @entity100 's view that only senior politicians should publish details
but transparency should not extend to spouses such as his lawyer wife
