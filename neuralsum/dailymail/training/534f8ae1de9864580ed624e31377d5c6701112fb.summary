by @entity1 reporter at first glimpse these pictures may look like nothing out of the ordinary - appearing to just show an ordinary leaf or a branch of a tree			2
but on closer inspection you can spot some of nature 's true masters of disguise playing a killer game of hide and seek			1
from a katydid disguised as a leaf to a tiny @entity18 camouflaged in sea fan in @entity20 , these images showcase the creatures who can quite literally blend into the background			1
nothing out of the ordinary : a leaf mimic katydid is an uncanny addition to a group of leaves , left , and a @entity31 - mimic katydid is barely noticeable camouflaged on tree illusionist : a leaf - mimic katydid - also known as a bush - cricket - camouflaged to look like a dead leaf to hide itself from predators masters of disguise : an oak beauty caterpillar branching out , left , and a hooded mantis hiding among leaves in a @entity44 tropical rainforest barking up the wrong tree : a common potoo - a nocturnal bird which breeds in tropical @entity47 - blending into the bark on a tree branch hiding in the deep : a tiny @entity18 , which only grow up to 2cms , pictured at 130 feet below sea level on a sea fan in @entity20 making no mark : another leaf mimic katydid shows off its incredible camouflaging skills by mimicking the leaf it is standing on the talented animals have the ability to camouflage themselves within their environment to hide from predators as a means of survival in the natural world			1
the creatures photographed in this series of images use two basic methods of concealment in a bid to hide from predators and catch prey			2
some animals , such as the flat fish , use their colour to blend into a background making them barely visible			0
whereas others , such as the @entity82 , cleverly mimic their surroundings using their shape , colour and texture to become part of the landscape			2
photographer @entity89 who captured these images of camouflage animals said the animals used their talent to remain hidden from predators			0
creepy crawler : a well camouflaged large huntsman spider , which uses its venom to paralyse its prey , but is thought to not be particularly dangerous to healthy humans lying in wait : the eyes of a flatfish peering up from its seafloor are the only thing that reveals its hiding place keeping a keen eye : @entity89 , who took this snap of a tiny red crab camouflaged on a @entity109 in @entity20 , said even he sometimes struggles to spot the creatures he photographs in the eye of the beholder : a lantern fly - a @entity114 and @entity115 planthopper - captured in a defensive display by photographer @entity89 he said some had mastered the art of invisible so well it was a challenge for him to even spot them			1
he said : ' @entity82 look so much like leaves in their colour , detail and texture , it actually looks like the leaves are copying the katydids			0
' they are so used to pretending to be leaves they have the ability to remain completely still			0
' there are also caterpillars who are such good leaf mimics when the wind blows they 'll move themselves so as to appear like dead leaves blowing in the wind			0
it really is quite amazing to witness			0
' where 's @entity140 ? : a triplefin fish , found around the coast of @entity143 at depths of about 15m , swimming by tunicates to blend in the invisible shrimp : a transparent anemone shrimp , found in many coral reefs around the world , hidden in an anemone a prickly pink customer : a well - camouflaged majid crab crawling across a soft pink coral blending in : a small shrimp surrounded by the stinging tentacles of a sea anemone which feed on small fish and shrimp undercover creature : a leaf mimic katydid camouflaged to look like leaf for defence from predators impressive disguise : a grasshopper camouflaged like a dead leaf is almost completely unrecognisable			1
