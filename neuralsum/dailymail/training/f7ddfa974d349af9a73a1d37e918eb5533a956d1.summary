complications : @entity1 had surgery to go from an a to a @entity5 cup @entity1 had always dreamed of having a more curvaceous figure			1
so at 25 , and tired of her ‘ boyish ’ shape , she decided to buy what @entity8 had not given her			2
she paid almost £ 4,000 for a breast implant operation , increasing her a-cup size breasts to @entity5			1
but to her horror , just two months after the surgery , her body started to reject one of the implants			1
weeks later , it actually started protruding from her chest and came through the skin			2
now the nursery worker wants to warn women of the potential pitfalls of cosmetic surgery			2
‘ i could n’t believe it when the implant started coming out of my breast , ’ she recalled			2
‘ at first it was like a blister , but then over the next week it started to come out more and more			0
‘ i did not feel too much pain , just discomfort			0
the doctors at the hospital said they had never seen anything like it – they could n’t believe i was not in septic shock			0
i feel very lucky , it could have been a lot worse			0
’ miss @entity1 , from @entity39 , paid £ 3,750 at a private clinic for breast implants in september 2009			1
soon after the surgery , her right breast became hard and lumpy			2
doctors diagnosed capsular contracture , a common complication in implant surgery , in which the body forms a capsule of scar tissue around the implant			1
unhappy : @entity1 decided to have surgery because she was she hated her flat chest and was ' fed - up of looking like a boy ' but her body rejected one of the implants and began removing it through the weakened tissue of the scar it is a natural process and usually settles			1
in miss @entity1 ’s case , however , the scar tissue tightened around the implant so much that it started squeezing it out of her body			1
she paid another £ 850 for surgeons to replace the implant			2
but two months later she was rushed to @entity69 at @entity70 when the implant started protruding from her breast			1
uneven : after the right implant worked its way out , @entity1 ( centre ) was forced to insert extra padding into her bra to even up her lopsided breast unlucky : @entity1 , who had surgery the same day as her sister @entity80 ( right ) wants to warn other women of the potential dangers of having implants @entity1 paid £ 3,750 at a private clinic for breast implants in september 2009 after checks , she was transferred back to the @entity88 clinic in @entity89 where surgeons safely removed the rejected implant			1
then came the worst part of her ordeal			0
she had to wait seven months for her body to heal , with one breast totally flat and the other still dd before doctors could replace the implant again			1
she also had to pay another £ 1,000			0
‘ the most horrific thing was having only one breast for seven months , ’ she said			0
‘ i was booked to go on holiday to @entity102 for two weeks so i had to pad out my bra so people would not notice			0
when i booked the operation they told me it was common for the body to reject implants – but i had no idea this could happen			1
‘ people always ask me if i would have implants again after all i have been through but i always say yes			0
i do n’t regret it at all			0
but it has cost me a fortune to have all the follow - up operations			0
’ a spokesman for @entity88 said : ‘ most women who have breast implants will experience some level of capsular contracture			0
@entity1 ’s is probably one of the worst cases we have seen			1
’ @entity126 contracture , an unavoidable complication of breast implant surgery , affects most patients to some degree			2
if it occurs , it is likely further surgery will be needed			0
the body creates a capsule of fibrous scar issue about the breast implant as part of the healing process			1
this is a natural reaction that occurs when any foreign object is surgically implanted into the body			0
the scar tissue over time will begin to shrink at a rate and extent which varies from person to person			0
in some cases , such as @entity1 's , the capsule can tighten and squeeze the implant , making the breast feel hard or even eject itself from the body .			1

@entity1 , 25 , had the surgery to go from a size a cup to a dd
but her body rejected one of the implants and she had to have it *re-done*
two months later she discovered the implant hanging out of her chest
the scar had not fully healed and there was a weakness in the tissues
