@entity1 's attacking gifts are n't enough to make up for his defensive deficiencies anymore , said @entity3 in a scathing attack on the @entity5 following @entity7 's 4 - 2 derby loss to @entity8			1
@entity9 's @entity7 were poor for all but the opening 15 minutes against @entity12 's side at @entity13 and @entity3 , speaking on @entity14 , is certain big changes are afoot for the club			1
' it 's a crossroads for them now , ' @entity3 said as @entity7 drifted four points behind their third - placed cross-city rivals who are now one point off @entity23 in second			1
@entity1 's defensive lapses are costing @entity7 , claims @entity14 pundit @entity3 @entity26 and @entity27 joined the chorus of criticism of the under - fire @entity5 ' there is definitely going to be change at @entity7 , whether it 's players , the manager , people above			1
' there are some weeds in the garden and you 've got to get them out of the changing room pretty quick			1
you can not carry passengers			2
' @entity3 singled out @entity1 as an example of the ' weeds ' at the @entity47 in a scathing attack			1
' he does that much for the team in an attacking sense you live with maybe the consequences of that defensively , ' he said			2
' but when the balance tips to a point when going forward is n't quite as effective as it once was , you 've got to do something different because the defensive side is poor			2
@entity3 predicts changes at @entity7 and says the club need to get rid of ' weeds in the garden ' ' if i was a player in that dressing room looking at him in central midfield thinking you 're not chasing back , you 're not running around , you 're not sprinting for the ball			1
there might be a physical problem that he can not do it , let alone if he does n't want to do it			0
i think there 's definitely going to be some changes			0
' @entity27 , also on @entity14 , even suggested the 31 - year - old 's work when his side does n't have the ball is a factor in their disappointing @entity80 results in recent years			1
@entity3 accused @entity1 of a ' complete dereliction of ( his ) duty ' when marking @entity83 and blamed his lack of tracking back for @entity8 's third goal from @entity86			1
city players ' heads drop after conceding the fourth goal on sunday their their cross-city rivals ' he can not play in a two in midfield against an opposition of any quality , ' said @entity3 on @entity14			1
' against maybe one of the lesser teams at home you can put him in there and play with two up top , but against any team of quality you 've got to shift him out of that position in the centre of midfield			1
' there are too many examples , too much evidence when watching him where he can not do his job , simple as that			0
as a central midfield player in the big matches he just can not do it			1
' @entity27 said @entity1 's become ' a bit of a liability ' for @entity7 in the past two years , despite being instrumental to their @entity116 title win last season			1
@entity83 and @entity118 celebrate after the winger 's cross found the tall @entity121 for 2 - 1 ' when he is playing and he has the ball at his feet , he is a real threat going forward , ' the former @entity123 midfielder said			2
' when they do n't have the ball he does n't want to take part and come back towards his own goal			0
' ' he just does n't take part when @entity7 have the ball , they 're too easy to play against			2
and that 's a problem they 've had for the last couple of seasons			0
and maybe that 's one of the big reasons why they 've not done as well as they should have done in @entity138			0
' @entity140 columnist @entity139 pointed the finger at the @entity7 chiefs for allowing the team to get into their current state and said the fallen champions are ' gone '			2
the former @entity123 defender told @entity147 : ' they ’ve been a great team , but that team needs breaking up and changing			0
the criticism i have is for the people at the top , to have that much money and to allow yourself to get into a situation where you might need five or six players to go straight into the team			2
' you look at the age of the team and it ’s too old , so you need a lot of new blood			0
it ’s going to take a lot of money			0
' it ’s gone for them now , physically , mentally , every part of the game			0
they ’ve been a great team and we should applaud what they ’ve achieved over the past three or four years , but it ’s the end for this team now			0
it ’s got to be broken up			0
' @entity26 , also on @entity14 , said bluntly : ' @entity7 lost out today because he was all at sea and did n't do his defensive duties			1
' @entity1 also came in for criticism on @entity180 for his lack of leadership after he took the captain 's armband at half - time			1
@entity186 said : ' he keeps on getting caught in no - mans land , he 's not really at it , clipping the heels , and he 's literally going through the motions			2
@entity186 and @entity191 were both critical of @entity7 and @entity1 on @entity180 ' @entity83 has completely outshone him today			1
he is outnumbered and i 'm sure he 's frustrated but again he 's just going through the motions			0
' picking out on particular aerial duel , which @entity1 lost , @entity186 said : ' this is nothing to do with ability , that 's to do with desire and wanting to take one for the team			1
' @entity186 also felt @entity1 was at fault for @entity201 's goal , @entity8 's fourth			1
' he 's got to organise this better , ' he said			0
' if you 're captain of the team you 've got to keep that high line , dictate and tell the lads to get in positions and win the ball			0
they were queuing up on the far stick			0
' @entity191 said : ' the minute they concede a goal and their backs are against the wall , they crumble			0
they lost their shape , they lost their discipline , they were all over the place			2
' there was nobody in there today that said " right , we 're going to get two banks of four , hard to beat and actually try to grind out a result "			0
