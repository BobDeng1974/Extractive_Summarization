for any music fan , meeting their idol is likely to be emotional			2
but for @entity9 , standing side by side with @entity6 singer @entity5 at a glamorous awards ceremony in @entity8 earlier this year was an extremely poignant moment in a long and remarkable journey			1
just 17 months earlier , the @entity13 undergraduate , who was training to be a pilot , had been all but written off by doctors after being struck by a speeding taxi as he walked home from a party			1
his injuries were so profound that he was in a coma for six months , at first suffering life - threatening seizures			1
his distraught parents were told on a number of occasions to prepare for the worst			2
the brain damage he suffered also left him with profound memory loss			2
so it is nothing short of astonishing that today he has recovered all of his faculties – and even manages to crack wry jokes about how it is his parents , rather than him , who struggle to remember details of the past , and that the inside of his head is still ‘ like mashed potato ’			1
but more interestingly , @entity9 , 22 , credits his return to health partly to a pioneering form of music therapy that is showing huge promise and is helping those like him recover their memories			1
listening to @entity6 , one of his favourite bands , was key to the process			1
@entity57 being wheelchair - bound and in ‘ a fog ’ that meant he could barely recall his own name , when @entity9 sat at a piano , he could play the chords to @entity6 songs which he had learned during music lessons before the accident			1
he explains : ‘ before i could walk or talk , and while i was still in a wheelchair , i could be pushed up to the piano and i would bang out @entity68 by @entity69			1
i remembered the chords for that , but i had no other memory			2
family ties : @entity9 is surrounded by his sisters @entity75 , far left , @entity76 , centre , and @entity78 after emerging from his coma , six months after the accident ‘ then i started to remember the @entity6 stuff i used to play			1
music makes me feel different because i spend most of the week concentrating on walking better and thinking better			2
when i put my fingers on the keys , i just let it go and concentrate on other stuff			2
that ’s what unlocked my brain			2
’ he laughs again , describing how @entity88 reminds him of his mother @entity89 , @entity90 of his father @entity91 , and one direction of his younger sister @entity76			2
on hearing @entity9 ’s story , @entity96 and the band ’s lead guitarist @entity94 offered to personally present him with the handwritten signed lyrics to their chart - topping 2011 single @entity99 , at the @entity30 in june			1
the fundraising gala is hosted each year by charity @entity101 , which provides music therapy to patients with a range of illnesses and needs			2
@entity5 was moved to tears by @entity9 ’s plight			1
‘ hearing his story and meeting him was amazing			0
it was so moving and so powerful , ’ he says			0
the brain comprises billions of nerve cells called neurons			0
these transmit chemical signals to each other and control every aspect of our bodies			0
few cells are added after birth , but existing neurons grow larger and connect with one another in response to external stimulus			0
this is how we learn			0
when the brain tissue is injured , cells die and these neural pathways can be broken			0
physiotherapy , speech therapy , art therapy and even social interaction can help the pathways regrow			0
they work by either retraining muscles , stimulating mental processes or finding alternative ways of communicating or moving			0
music can recruit new areas of the brain if one part of the network is damaged			0
making music uses a huge range of mental functions : memory , sequencing , organising , co-ordinating and movement			0
even singing means that memory of speech is stimulated , hormone levels are increased , the heart rate can change and the immune system is boosted			0
‘ he ’s just a good guy and hearing what he ’s been through and is still going through , puts things into perspective			0
it makes everything we do feel worthwhile			0
’ on stage , @entity89 , a 48 - year - old nurse , told of the extraordinary power of music therapy , and the role that @entity101 therapist @entity168 played in her son ’s rehabilitation			1
experts believe that listening to and playing music , which involves a complex combination of mental processes including perception and memory , can effectively be used to retrain and re-educate the injured brain			0
@entity9 is a striking example of the rehabilitative effect			1
three months after his accident , and still in coma , he was transferred from a hospital in @entity183 to @entity184 ’s in @entity185 , then on to @entity186 in @entity187 to be nearer his family home in @entity189			1
then , six months to the day after his accident , he began to wake up			2
still in a minimally conscious state , he began an intensive course of rehabilitation , incorporating physiotherapy and speech , occupational and music therapies			0
@entity196 , a former professional violinist and music teacher , has worked as a @entity101 music therapist for 15 years in hospices , special needs schools , care homes and now at @entity186			0
she explains how , like many male brain - injury patients , @entity9 struggled to speak , at first saying the few words he could manage in either a high - pitched whine or flat monotone			1
‘ i used the piano and my own voice to make a range of noise combinations , which @entity9 would attempt to mimic , ’ she explains			1
‘ we would begin a musical question - and - answer session where we would try to get him to reregister his voice , then guide him through many chords			2
you would make a harmony , taking him up and down , so he would regain the inflection in his voice , both for speaking and singing			0
’ remarkably , and it is not yet fully understood why , many patients with brain injuries retain the ability to sing even when their normal speech is quite affected , so @entity196 tried to harness the melody of his unimpaired song and attach it to @entity9 ’s speech			1
she began by freely improvising conversation in song , so that @entity9 was n’t concentrating on the meaning of his words but the melodic framework of the delivery			1
‘ as soon as we went into a conversation about something he had to give some thought to , and he focused on the meaning , he would drop out of melodic conversation and revert to monotone , ’ she explains			0
inspiration : @entity6 's music played a crucial part in @entity9 's rehabilitation after the accident however , using @entity196 ’s strategy , @entity9 was able to go away and practise melodic chat on his own , taking the initiative in his own rehabilitation			1
when he was ready to come out of his wheelchair , @entity196 – working alongside physio - and occupational therapists – used a drum to help @entity9 regain a natural walking rhythm that gave him balance and momentum			1
the simple effect of a marching beat gives the body a natural cadence to mirror			0
she also dovetailed with other members of the clinical team to work on improving @entity9 ’s finger control , using the piano keys as a tool			1
as a child , @entity9 showed a talent for music , reaching grade four on the piano , before abandoning formal lessons to enjoy playing by ear			1
he was eager to experience this liberating sensation again and with @entity196 ’s help , he would go home on weekend leave from the hospital and come back having learned to play a new piece of music			2
he even attempted to sing along , too			0
‘ @entity9 would challenge himself by choosing the most difficult chords , but he had the most incredible determination and could sense the way the process of playing again was affecting his whole life , ’ recalls @entity196			1
@entity89 says it also allowed @entity9 to give something back to the people around him			1
‘ he has pushed himself constantly and responded to music in a truly incredible , inspirational way			0
‘ it normalises him – all youngsters have music as part of their life			0
they may play in bands or they bond with others because of their musical tastes			2
’ @entity9 continues to use music to put memories into context and to help him recall situations and people in his life			1
it is a recognised strategy that many therapists use to help patients reassemble the jigsaw puzzle of their life			0
music has become a focal point of @entity9 ’s ongoing recovery and , although he stopped working with @entity196 when he was discharged from hospital in april , he now has piano lessons and singing lessons at home			1
‘ if i am improving in walking , that does n’t matter to me as much as improving my piano			2
i want to serenade the ladies like @entity316			0
he has it all – he is handsome and he has talent , ’ he laughs			0
when he first woke from his coma , @entity9 had two goals			1
one of them was fulfilled last month when he celebrated his 22nd birthday by playing beach cricket with his parents , sisters – @entity75 , 23 , @entity76 , 19 , and 18 - year - old @entity78 – and friends during a holiday on @entity328			1
his second goal is to fulfil a request from his mother – to play @entity332 by @entity333			2
it is something he is working towards every day			0
‘ it ’s the lyrics , ’ he says , whispering in my ear			0
‘ she gets really soppy when she hears the lyrics			0

@entity9 , 22 , was hit by a speeding taxi in 2012 and went into a coma
six months later he woke up , unable to walk , talk or remember his name
however , from his wheelchair , he could still play @entity6 on the piano
nearly a year - and - a - half later , @entity9 has regained almost all his lost abilites
