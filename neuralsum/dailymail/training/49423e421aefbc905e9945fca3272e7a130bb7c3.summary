' @entity83 slept with gold on her face and ancient @entity87 treatments have always used gold			2
' @entity71 , who is trained in @entity87 treatments herself , explains that the skin is first smoothed and resurfaced with micro-dermabrasion before pure oxygen at 21 per cent ( any higher creates free radicals ) is blasted onto the skin to push the formula of the serum deep into the skin ’s epidermis			0
