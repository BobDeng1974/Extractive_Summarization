and here , @entity3 's @entity2 gives you the lowdown on the new season of the championship			2
best bit of business @entity11 ’s @entity10 , 22 , has returned on loan to @entity13 , where he scored 24 goals in his first season in @entity17 football , winning the 2012 - 13 @entity18			1
he was rarely used during his loan at @entity20 but insisted he did n’t want a return to the second tier			1
if he can get over the disappointment , he might be the signing of the summer			2
back again : @entity10 could turn out to be a fine signing for @entity13 , returning for his second spell at the club already under pressure @entity30 boss @entity29			1
the club ’s owner , @entity31 , is about as unconventional as you get and this appointment was straight out of left field			1
@entity29 has only previously managed @entity36 , a tenure that hardly sparkled			0
his reward is a club with a great history and an owner known as the ‘ mangiallenatori — manager eater — because he has worked his way through 37 in 22 years in football			2
manager on the rise @entity48			0
split across two spells at @entity50 , the 36 - year - old has led the club from 23rd in the fourth tier to the @entity7			2
loves passing football and @entity55 said : ‘ it is coaches like @entity48 who will take the game forward in this country			0
’ pressure : @entity29 knows he must impress @entity31 straight away at @entity30 to survive players to watch @entity62 ( @entity63 ) : turned down @entity64 to join @entity63 and has looked superb			1
he ’s a technically gifted midfielder			0
@entity66 ( @entity67 ) : only just turned 19 and a fine midfielder who already plays for @entity70 ’s under - 21 side			0
@entity71 ( @entity72 ) : a prolific striker			0
with the most recent first , his goal tallies for the past five seasons are : 25 , 28 , 36 , 16 , 19			0
star talent : will @entity66 will look to kick on with @entity67 again this season likely strugglers @entity78 – @entity79 to stay up last season and new manager @entity81 arrived to find he had only six professionals to work with			1
@entity83 – finished 19th last season and added little quality over the summer			0
@entity86 – survived on a dramatic end to last season and @entity88 has instigated a mass rebuild of his squad			0
protests : things are already bad off the field for @entity78 , let alone on it contenders @entity63 — kept most of their squad and made strong signings in @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			1
@entity102 — @entity103 has had an extremely busy summer in the market , signing nine players			1
@entity67 — looking to make up for missing promotion last season			0
new boy @entity109 has suffered a bad knee injury			0
the big spenders @entity102 have signed nine players and spent an astonishing £ 11million for 27 - year - old @entity112 from @entity30			1
it ’s the biggest fee paid by a club in the championship			2
hefty fee : @entity112 will hope to live up to his £ 11m price tag for @entity102 this season			1

@entity102 and @entity63 could be the main contenders
@entity78 are *destined* to struggle with their *problems* off the pitch
@entity10 could be a star for @entity13 on his return to the club
