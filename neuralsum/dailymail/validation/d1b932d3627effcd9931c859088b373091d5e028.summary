from machine parts and houses to replacement organs , humans look set to be able to create almost anything using 3d printers in years to come			1
and @entity6 believes we could even be 3d printing entire people in ‘ our lifetime ’			1
the musician and entrepreneur believes the surge in printing technology will shortly make this incredible feat possible and has called for ‘ new morals , new laws and new codes ’ to govern the technology			1
musicians and entrepreneur @entity6 believes we could even be 3d printing whole people in ‘ our lifetime ’			1
he called for ‘ new morals , new laws and new codes ’ to govern the technology , while unveiling an @entity24 pop - up shop in @entity25 , which uses waste material to @entity28 print objects ( a bust is shown ) and create new clothes he told @entity32 ’s @entity31 : ‘ eventually 3d printing will print people			1
i 'm not saying i agree with it , i 'm just saying what 's fact based on plausible growth in technology			2
’ he believes that humans will be pushed to adhere to new responsibilities so there should be laws to protect people and force us to do the right thing			1
researchers are making huge strides in printing organs using living cells and are expected to be able to print human tissues such as a heart in less than a decade			2
‘ if you can print a liver or a kidney , god dang it , you 're going to be able to print a whole freaking person , ’ @entity6 said			1
@entity6 ( pictured ) described 3d printers as ‘ god - like tools ’ which could be used to create life and even allow teleportation one day			1
he believes that humans will be pushed to adhere to new responsibilities so there should be laws to protect people and force us to do the right thing from a human ear , to perfectly functioning valves , 3d printers are already being used in medicine			1
their ultimate goal is to create a new heart for a patient using their own cells that could be transplanted , but experts say it could be years or decades before such operations are regularly performed			2
the finished product would be called the ‘ bioficial heart ’ - a blend of the natural and artificial			1
the heart may be built from cells taken from the patient 's fat			0
but plenty of difficulties remain , including understanding how to keep manufactured tissue alive after it is printed			0
patients in the operating theatre would have some fat tissue removed and regenerative cells isolated			0
the cells would then be mixed with solutions and placed in the bioprinter , which prints the heart			0
the new organ would then be transplanted in another operation			0
he described 3d printers as ‘ god - like tools ’ which could be used to create life and even allow teleportation one day			1
@entity6 made the remarks at the launch of a range of sustainable lifestyle products , including clothing , bicycles and luggage , which he created with @entity111 – a recycling initiative with @entity113			1
on sale at @entity117 department store , @entity25 , the products are made using waste materials such as 3d - printer filament produced from recycled plastic bottles			1
he told @entity121 that 3d printing technology ‘ will revolutionise society ’ and that in 10 year ’s time , everyone will have a 3d printer in their house			1
‘ your friend will say : “ let ’s hurry up ” and you ’ll go , “ wait , my shoes have n’t finished printing yet			2
” ’ @entity6 has already unveiled a smartband called @entity136 , which has its own sim card inside to replace a smartphone			1
@entity140 citizens can apply to buy the wearable for $ 399 ( £ 264 )			0
while @entity6 may be worried about the possibility or printing humans , @entity142 and @entity143 fear we could be wiped out by intelligent robots			1
a group of scientists and entrepreneurs , including the two revered men , have signed an open letter promising to ensure that @entity154 research benefits humanity			0
the letter warns that without safeguards on intelligent machines , mankind could be heading for a dark future			0
the document , drafted by the @entity161 , said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind while developing technology such as speech recognition , image analysis , driverless cars , translation and robot motion which could benefit people			1
@entity6 launched his smartwatch , that can make phone calls without being linked to a smartphone , in october last year			1
the @entity136 smartwatch boasts an array of apps , gps and a voice - controlled personal assistant like @entity179			2
crucially , it includes a sim card reader next to the battery , which is fitted into the wide wristband , to make phone calls possible			0
a curved touchscreen is also built into the cuff design			0
@entity6 unveiled his smartwatch , which can make phone calls without being linked to a smartphone , in october last year			1
called the @entity136 , it can make phone calls without being linked to a smartphone			0
it has a curved touch screen and a sim card reader built into its distinctive cuff design it has @entity198 of memory , @entity200 of @entity201 , speakers , 3g and @entity204 connectivity as well as @entity177 for maps and a pedometer and accelerometer for fitness apps			0
the watch runs on an @entity211 - based operating system using a @entity213 processor , according to @entity214			2
like @entity217 ’s @entity216 and @entity218 , the device includes a voice - controlled assistant			2
called @entity221 , it is described as the ‘ virtual personality and the soul of @entity136 ’ which can be used with popular apps such as @entity225 and @entity226			2
@entity6 said : ‘ @entity136 represents my passion for , and my mission to marry design and advanced technology – to create a new breed of wearable device that leapfrogs what is currently on the market			1
‘ … we designed @entity235 from the ground up , taking her from an innovative concept to a reality			2
you speak , she listens			0
you ask , she delivers			0
you need something , @entity243 ’s ready			0
‘ with you at all times and incredibly capable – @entity243 is the perfect virtual personal assistant			0
’ while the smartwatch does n't have a heartbeat sensor like some of its rivals , it apparently detects emotions and can share these ‘ vibes ’ with others using an app called @entity254			2
a built - in music app will allow users to store music locally , as well as use a digital music service from a @entity261 company called 7digital			0
because the @entity136 is a stand - alone gadget , it requires its own data plan			0
this will be available from @entity266 in the @entity140 and from @entity267 in the @entity261			0
the cuff will come in black , white , pink and blue			0
while there is no news about the device in the @entity261 yet , @entity140 citizens can now apply to purchase the @entity136 for $ 399 ( £ 264 ) by joining the ' make it @entity274 ' programme .			0
