many of us will vow to give up alcohol this month , due to the toll it takes on our looks and health			1
but should it be coffee we ’re quitting instead ? what started out as a morning treat has turned into a number of caffeine fixes to get us through the day			1
but like booze , regularly consuming more than the safe daily limit of caffeine ( between 200 and 400 mg , equivalent to two large @entity15 at a @entity17 chain ) is undoubtedly bad for us			1
while it may stimulate the tastebuds and keep us alert , drinking too much coffee can pile on the pounds , age our skin , and even be responsible for cystitis , cellulite and bad breath			1
your skin looks older these days , it seems no one goes anywhere without a takeout coffee cup			1
but the habit could lead to prematurely older - looking skin , according to nutritionist @entity34			1
‘ one coffee is no worse than a glass of wine , but you can have too much of it , ’ she says			1
‘ skin needs lots of water to look plump and glowing			1
but coffee is a diuretic , encouraging your body to flush out water			2
if you drink too much coffee , your skin will look as dehydrated as when you have a hangover			1
if you drink too much coffee , your skin will look as dehydrated as when you have a hangover ( picture posed by a model ) flooding your body with caffeine means your nervous system is in a constant state of artificial stimulation , adds @entity34			1
‘ skin is your largest organ and needs oxygen - rich blood			1
when the body is in a state of stress , it responds by directing the most highly - oxygenated blood towards the heart and lungs , so skin does n’t get as well nourished			1
‘ the lymphatic system , which clears waste products , also does n’t work as efficiently , leaving skin sluggish and breakout - prone			1
’ you get cellulite caffeine is an ingredient in some skin creams — but that does n’t mean drinking it will have the same positive effect			1
there are 16,501 coffee shops in the @entity85 , with sales growing by 6.4 per cent from last year ‘ coffee is used in many anti-cellulite creams — applied to the outside of the skin , it draws out the stored toxins in the fat cells , thereby reducing cellulite , ’ says nutritionist @entity87 , author of @entity88 , which looks at the latest evidence on how to revitalise the digestive system			1
she adds that dehydration caused by coffee encourages the skin to become congested and hardened and to form a dense mesh , which leads to cellulite			1
you get bad breath like alcohol , coffee dehydrates your mouth , says dentist dr @entity108 , of the @entity109 in @entity110			1
‘ as a result , there ’s less saliva to rinse your mouth and fight bacteria			0
’ and if you drink milky coffee , this allows the milky residue to ferment and rot , giving off noxious smells , he adds			2
over time , caffeine can turn teeth yellow in the same way as nicotine from cigarettes			0
dentist dr @entity125 of @entity126 , in @entity127 , says : ‘ coffee contain tannins — plant compounds which give these drinks their flavour — and acids			1
over time , these break down the enamel on teeth ’s surface			0
‘ the tannins penetrate the surface and stick to the enamel			0
over time , that can make the teeth look yellow or brown			2
’ you put on weight a @entity147 whole milk @entity148 has 299 calories — while the apparently less fattening semi-skimmed version has only 50 fewer calories it ’s known that drinking too much booze can make you pile on the pounds			1
but your coffee habit may also be to blame			2
for example , a @entity147 whole milk @entity148 has 299 calories — while the apparently less fattening semi-skimmed version has only 50 fewer calories			1
that ’s more than a 250ml glass of white wine at 185 calories			0
if we grab a carbohydrate treat , such as a muffin , at the counter , coffee ’s effect on blood sugar makes those goodies even more fattening , a study by the @entity163 in @entity164 found			2
nutritional therapist @entity173 says caffeine interferes with insulin levels , which control how much fat our bodies store			0
‘ in the @entity164 study , it was found people having the coffee and carbs combination tripled their blood sugar levels , while insulin was reduced by half			2
‘ this combination of high blood glucose levels and poor insulin function is a recipe for weight gain and increased risk of diabetes , as the excess blood glucose is dumped into storage as fat			0
’ celebrity trainer @entity198 , author of @entity199 , says all her clients who have given up caffeine have lost weight			0
‘ caffeine can affect people ’s sleep , which means they are more tired during the day , ’ she says			0
‘ this can lead to weight gain as they crave carbs and sugar and are less likely to have the energy to exercise			0
’ you have bad toilet habits drinking more than three cups of coffee a day has a diuretic effect on the body , because it interferes with the hormones that regulate our water balance			1
this leaves us dehydrated and makes urine more concentrated and acidic , inflaming the walls of the bladder and even leading to painful urination and cystitis			0
in a study by the @entity228 , of 1,356 women who drank around three cups of coffee or more a day , 70 per cent were more likely to have bladder problems			1
in fact , women who suffer from urinary incontinence are advised by the @entity235 to cut back on coffee			2
you ’re tired all the time the energy boost we get from a shot of coffee is short - lived			1
coffee keeps us artificially wired by stimulating the adrenals — two walnut - size glands sitting on top of your kidneys , which control stress hormones			1
it can be hard to tell how much caffeine we are drinking when buying coffee			2
@entity253 researchers bought single - shot espressos from 20 coffee shops in the city and measured their caffeine content			1
four had more than 200mg in a single cup — the strongest had more than 300mg , almost at the daily accepted safe amount			2
the energy boost we get from a shot of coffee is short - lived			1
coffee keeps us artificially wired by stimulating the adrenals — which control stress hormones ( picture posed by a model ) if the levels of fight - or - flight hormone are constantly raised by a flood of caffeine during the day , raising heart and breathing rates and muscle tension , this can cause long - term fatigue			1
factor in that it takes from five to 12 hours for the body to get rid of caffeine and , when you fall into bed , you may still not be able to sleep			0
once you do nod off , coffee makes sleep lighter and more disturbed			2
studies have found this is because caffeine interferes with the production of melatonin , which helps us sleep			0
a study in the @entity292 found drinking caffeine as much as six hours before bed significantly disturbs sleep , reducing total sleep by over an hour			0
every day ’s a bad hair day caffeine has been found to flush vital minerals , including iron needed for healthy hair growth , out of the body			2
the effect is thinning hair , according to @entity305 , nutritionist at @entity306			0
‘ our body needs good supplies of certain vitamins and minerals for good hair condition and pigmentation , including biotin , selenium , zinc and copper			0
coffee can flush out vital minerals needed by the body for healthy hair growth causing thinning hair ‘ if we consume lots of coffee , this will affect our mineral stores , which could have a negative impact on hair condition , including shine and texture			1
’ the loss of minerals may even trigger hair loss and premature greyness			0
‘ one of the primary causes of hair loss in women before menopause is low levels of iron , and coffee affects their absorption of that			2
copper is thought to contribute to hair pigmentation , so any deficiency may cause early greying			0
’ @entity347 @entity346 says women are more at risk of caffeine - induced hair loss than men			2
‘ lack of iron shortens the hair ’s growth cycle , making it fall out more quickly , ’ he says			0
‘ this is especially so for women , who are more susceptible because of low iron levels due to blood loss during their menstrual cycles			0
’ you find it harder to conceive if you are thinking of having a baby , fertility expert @entity362 advises cutting back on coffee			2
studies in the @entity366 show caffeine stops the muscles in the fallopian tubes in the ovaries from contracting			0
these rhythmic contractions waft the egg from the ovaries to the womb to be met by sperm			0
instead , the egg gets ‘ stuck ’			0
other research has found a link between caffeine and conception problems			0
@entity382 researchers at @entity383 found women who drink more than 300mg of caffeine a day ( two 8oz cups of coffee ) have a 27 per cent lower chance of getting pregnant , compared with women who do n’t drink it			0
once conception has taken place , more than one coffee a day can put your unborn baby at risk , as caffeine has been found to constrict blood vessels and interfere with hormone levels			0
one study found women who drink more than 200mg of caffeine a day have double the miscarriage rate , compared with non-drinkers			0
the studies have led the @entity406 to advise pregnant women to have no more than two cups of instant coffee a day			0
@entity362 says : ‘ if you are trying for a baby , it would be wiser to regard coffee as an occasional treat			0

these days its rare not to see a @entity147 on every corner
coffee has become part of our daily routine - but could it be causing more problems than we *'re* aware of ?
it can make your skin look older , cause cellulite and give you bad breath
