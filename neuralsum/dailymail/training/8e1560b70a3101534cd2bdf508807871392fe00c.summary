@entity2 face @entity0 on tuesday evening in a @entity4 tie they simply ca n't lose			1
yet despite the appeal of the reigning champions of @entity8 and the 2013 competition winners , not to mention the importance of the game in the context of @entity2 's season , tickets are still available ahead of kick - off			1
@entity0 supporter and blogger @entity15 says this situation would be unthinkable in @entity8 , where the fan is treated with far greater respect			1
it ’s all about the quality			0
floodlights , @entity4 , @entity24 winners versus @entity26 champions			1
it ’s a scenario every football fan should be eager to experience live			0
yet @entity2 ’s @entity29 will not be sold out on tuesday night when @entity0 roll into town - an unimaginable scenario from a @entity8 perspective			1
the @entity29 will host tuesday 's @entity4 clash between @entity34 champions @entity2 and @entity8 giants @entity0 - but seats remain available in the hours leading up to kick - off @entity2 fans in full voice at the @entity29 - but are they getting a raw deal from the club ? @entity2 's website showed a number of seats still available for the must - win @entity0 match @entity0 celebrate scoring in front of another full house at the @entity47 against @entity48 on saturday @entity15 writes for the @entity50 blog here since @entity0 moved to the @entity47 in 2005 only a handful of games have not been in front of a full stadium			1
the main reason ? the club provides something for everyone			0
on the one hand , there is a huge amount of business seats , with cosy blankets and smoked salmon during half - time			2
these are fully booked by mid-size companies or people who want to enjoy @entity71 ’s best football team without freezing			0
but on the other hand , as a club member you can easily receive tickets for the @entity76			2
it is here that the ‘ magnificent atmosphere ’ which @entity79 has praised is created			2
for a @entity4 game , you would pay € 30 ( £ 23 )			1
football fans from @entity8 simply can not understand the @entity84 stadium and ticket policy			2
@entity2 ’s cheapest season ticket costs € 40 ( £ 32 ) more than the second - best category ticket in @entity88			1
no wonder the difference in terms of stadium atmosphere is so marked			2
@entity0 fans will descend on the @entity29 for the second consecutive season on tuesday night @entity95 and @entity97 fit for @entity0 showdown @entity0 fans show their colours on their visit to the @entity29 in last season 's @entity4 travelling @entity0 fans hang their banners at @entity104 ahead of last season 's quarter - finals @entity79 , who joined in the summer , has praised the @entity47 atmosphere in the @entity47 , nobody expects a suit and tie businessman to be cheering loudly for ‘ his ’ team , this is done by the fans in the @entity76			1
but if only a certain clientele of people can afford a stadium visit , there simply are n’t enough people to cheer the team on			0
the true @entity84 football fan can be found in the pub , where the atmosphere is much better in @entity34 than in @entity8 , but in the stadiums it is the other way around			2
the @entity26 often refers to its high average of stadium visitors , but it is not about quantity , it ’s about quality			0
twenty - five years after @entity130 it may also be the point to admit that safe standing needs to be reintroduced			0
in nearly every football league worldwide there are no more worries about the safety of terraces			0
the @entity138 and @entity71 are birds of a feather when it comes to all - seater stadiums , and it is no wonder that clubs like @entity2 suffer as a result			1
@entity0 's perennial success means getting a ticket for one of their matches is incredibly difficult @entity150 helped @entity0 lift the @entity4 in 2013 and they are desperate to repeat the feat this is the main problem of commercialised modern football : there is no demand for football fans who stand , cheer and push the team to the limits			1
club executives do n’t care as long as everybody wears the new £ 100 team shirt and consumes enough food and drink			0
@entity8 chairmen also love the revenue , of course , but not for the high price of selling the club ’s identity			0
from an economical point of view , simply looking at numbers and figures , the @entity24 should see the @entity26 as a role model			0
in terms of international marketing or tv revenues @entity176 ’ advertisement league is miles ahead			0
in terms of what makes a visit to the stadium worth watching , though , the @entity26 can be jealous of the @entity24			0
why else would the @entity2 fans not be filling their home ground tonight ? you can follow @entity15 on @entity186 here .			1
