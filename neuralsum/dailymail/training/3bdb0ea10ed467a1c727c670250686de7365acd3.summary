a taxi company in a town tainted by a child sex - grooming gang scandal is offering customers white drivers on demand			1
@entity8 minicab firm @entity7 is offering the choice after two taxi drivers of @entity12 origin were jailed for their part in the sex trafficking and rape of young white girls in the town			1
the firm , which bought out @entity18 - a company at the centre of the grooming scandal , has revealed that many customers were asking for white or ‘ local ’ drivers , it was reported last night			1
the firm ’s boss , @entity33 , manager of @entity7 , told the @entity35 : ‘ we have had quite a lot of customers requesting what they call a local driver			1
‘ a bit insane if you consider that most of the [ @entity43 ] lads were born in @entity8			0
but it ’s a business and we have got a duty to do what the customer asks us to			0
' @entity48 ' : @entity27 , the town ’s @entity28 mp , branded the development ' extremely worrying ' ‘ i do n’t think we can discriminate against the customer in the same way			1
it is a business at the end of the day			0
we have a large bank loan to pay back			0
’ mr @entity33 said around 20 drivers had left @entity57 after the two drivers were prosecuted			2
he added : ‘ one of them got a knife held to his throat , one of them had his car smashed up			0
’ mr @entity33 said the exodus cost him an estimated £ 40,000 - 30 per cent of the firm ’s annual profit : ‘ it was devastating			2
’ he said : ‘ the @entity43 drivers are harder working , they do what they are asked and they do n’t complain about it			0
' if the public could actually see these [ @entity43 ] people close up and see what they are about , i do n’t think they would be asking for white drivers			1
‘ we do get a lot of customers ringing up and asking us for a particular @entity43 guy as well			0
’ but he said customers who had asked for a white driver might have to wait as long as 20 minutes - compared with the average wait of three minutes			2
mr @entity27 said : ‘ this is extremely worrying and a stark reminder of the impact grooming scandals have had on northern towns			1
it must act as a wake - up call to politicians who just pretend tensions like this do n’t exist and bury their heads in the sand			0
’ @entity93 , of @entity94 , said : ‘ there is currently nothing in the conditions of their licence which state that they can not operate such a policy , just as some firms choose to offer customers only female drivers			2
