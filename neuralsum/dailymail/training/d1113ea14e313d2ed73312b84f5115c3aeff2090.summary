@entity70 , consumer editor of @entity71 , said there are ways people can get fit without over spending			0
she advised : ' whether you 're planning to join a gym , sign up to a new class or start a diet it 's worth investigating whether you can try before you buy			1
@entity82 gyms sometimes offer short term passes of 1 - 5 days so you can see whether a longer membership will work for you			2
' similarly diet providers will often offer introductory discounts so you can see whether a new eating plan fits with your lifestyle			0
there are even savings to be made on new equipment if you ’re planning to work out at home so make sure you check sites like @entity12 to find out the best deals to suit your resolution			2
' @entity96 contracts many people will join a gym in january with the best intentions and sign up for a year paying £ 50 + per month			1
but what if you find once you join that the gym is n't for you or a change of circumstances affects how often you can go ? avoid getting locked into an expensive contract you do n't need by seeing if you can do a free trial first			2
also , opt for council - run and basic gyms over their luxurious counterparts where your membership may be spent on decadent decor and wash products			2
many gyms today offer pay - as - you - go classes that are also a cheaper and more flexible alternative			1
@entity116 brands you do n't have to spend a fortune on clothing and trainers , especially if you are someone who will give up on your health kick by february			1
try websites like @entity123 and check discount websites for offer codes for sports shops			0
supermarkets such as @entity128 and @entity129 's also now offer sports gear			0
it might not be as high tech as bigger sports brands but will do the job if you only intend to work out once or twice a week			0
then if you do get hooked on exercise , you can then make a bigger investment in kit that you know wo n't be going to waste			0
@entity139 run free : parkruns take place every saturday around the @entity2 running is one of the cheapest and simplest forms of exercise to take up			2
get some trainers ( note the above on not overspending until you 're sure you 're going to continue ) and head out the door whenever you feel like it			0
if you find you need some company and motivation then there 's also numerous ways you can obtain this without spending lots of money			2
running clubs around the country offer annual membership at the fraction of the cost of gyms ( and are suitable for beginners )			0
visit www.britishathletics.org.uk/grassroots/search to find a club near you			0
or you can gain a free online running community thanks to @entity168 , a free running challenge for all abilities			0
participants sign up as individuals or as part of a team , then set themselves goals to strive for in january , february and march			0
@entity177 run can be logged as you go along and experiences shared with other users so you do n't feel alone when you 're pounding the pavements			0
finally , another way to run with others and strive to get faster without spending a penny is @entity185			0

@entity194 fitness programmes from industry experts can be carried out from the comfort of your own home without having to pay to go to a gym or buying expensive equipment			1
