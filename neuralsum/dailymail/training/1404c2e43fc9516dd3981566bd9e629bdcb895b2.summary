@entity1 ’s much - heralded new partnership with @entity2 was ‘ launched ’ with all the gusto of a flat balloon – a 75 - second video smuggled out on its website at noon on thursday			1
it was accompanied by brave talk of ‘ a new era ’ and ‘ making history ’ , but for a team famed for staging some of the most lavish launches in even @entity15 ’s decadent world , this online offering was shamefully tame			1
the video flashed from the old @entity2 to the 2015 model , the @entity18			2
the new car had a red streak up the sides and red wing mirrors , harking back to the chariots that took @entity24 and @entity25 to their title victories more than 20 years ago			0
@entity1 released the first images of the car they hope will fire them to @entity15 glory in 2015 @entity1 's 2015 challenger is the first to be powered by @entity2 in more than 20 years the flashes of red on the bodywork are a throwback to the cars which @entity24 and @entity25 raced @entity39 's @entity38 and @entity41 driver @entity40 will form a new - look partnership at @entity1 @entity38 was retained at the end of 2014 while @entity40 ended his stay with @entity45 to re-join @entity1 but it was a farcical ‘ launch ’ by the standards of @entity1 , who previously employed the @entity49 and @entity50 to accompany the unveiling of their cars			1
even the timing of the ‘ launch ’ was kept secret			0
and their drivers , @entity40 and @entity38 , were absent from the ‘ launch ’ video			1
@entity1 - @entity2 are hoping to recreate their glory period of the late @entity60 and early nineties , when they won four drivers ’ and four constructors ’ championship and 44 races from 80 starts			1
to do so , @entity2 will have to make a better job of matching @entity70 ’ engine than this launch did of representing a first - rank team			1
we will get the first indications of @entity1 - @entity2 ’s strength when testing starts in @entity77 , @entity78 , on sunday			1
the @entity49 helped launch @entity1 's 1997 challenge - pictured with @entity79 and @entity80 the @entity82 girl group performed at @entity83 in the build - up to the 1997 @entity15 campaign the team merely issued a press release containing quotes from management and the drivers			1
' the off - season has really brought about a sense of renewal coming into 2015 – continuing my relationship with @entity1 , getting married , and now embarking on such an exciting chapter : @entity1 ’s new partnership with @entity2 , ' said @entity38			1
' i ’ve trained hard over the winter , and i ’m absolutely itching to get going in the new @entity1 - @entity99 - 30			2
' it ’s been interesting to spend time in the factory during the past few weeks : you can really sense a feeling of reignited optimism and positivity around the building			0
i ’ve never seen such motivation amongst the guys – we ’re all massively keen to get going in @entity77 and to work hard on developing our new car			0
the splashes of red on this season 's car are a throwback to @entity1 's previous dominant spell with @entity2 @entity24 ( pictured ) and @entity25 formed a formidable partnership with @entity1 over 20 years ago ' but we ’re under no illusion that it will be easy – there ’s a huge challenge ahead of us to try to pull back the gap to our rivals , but we ’re certainly up for it			1
we ended last season with great momentum and clear progress , and i ’m determined to carry that forward into 2015			0
' i ’m also looking forward to working with my new team - mate , @entity130 [ @entity40 ] , and i ’m confident that our joint experience on track will pay dividends in our development race to get our team back to the front of the grid			2
i ’m hugely motivated to make more history in this new @entity1 - @entity2 era			1
' @entity40 , who re-joins the team he left so acrimoniously in 2007 , added : ' although the winter period is a time for rest and relaxation from racing , my motivation could not be stronger for the new season			1
' i ’ve done a lot of training during the winter break , to reach my peak physical fitness , and i ’ve been working hard in preparation for this new era of @entity2			2
i ’ve never felt better , or more ready for a new season			0
' of course , we ’re prepared for a steep learning curve , but it ’s clear to see that inside @entity2 there ’s total commitment , and a real change in feeling , as we start this new partnership			2
' our first target will be to learn the maximum from the car at the pre-season tests , understand the package , and extract as much performance as possible			0
that wo n’t be easy or trouble - free , but we ’re ready for that			0
why ? because our key focus will be on development			0
' historically , @entity1 has already been characterised by its ability to bring updates to the car quickly , and develop a strong package			2
' it ’s going to be a real privilege to be the first person to drive the new @entity1 - @entity99 - 30 at @entity77 , and i ca n’t wait to begin what i ’m certain will be a very exciting new chapter in my career			0
i ’m as motivated now as i was when i was given my first opportunity at the wheel of an @entity15 car			0
' last but not least , i ’m excited to be sitting alongside @entity38 , a great team - mate and a very experienced competitor			2
together we ’ll push the team forward , to learn , to progress , and eventually to achieve the best possible results together			0
we are ready for the new era			0
