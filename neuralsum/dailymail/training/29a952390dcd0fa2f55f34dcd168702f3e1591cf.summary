by @entity0 @entity1 : 16:06 est , 24 december 2013 @entity2 : 12:58 est , 25 december 2013 for more than a century this grand chamber lay neglected and damp under the streets of south east @entity5 , echoing only to the sound of passing trains			1
now the entry shaft to the @entity9 , whose sweeping staircase teemed with a million visitors in the month after it opened in 1843 , is being restored			1
touted as the birthplace of the modern @entity15 system , the first underwater tunnel in the world - built by @entity18 and his father @entity19 - is one of the most important sites in engineering history			1
but it closed in 1869 when the twin tunnels below ( see left ) were converted to take trains			2
now a concrete floor has been installed ( right ) and volunteers have won a grant for a full restoration @entity34 : the chamber has reopened for the first time with a concrete floor separating it from the trains , and volunteers have grand plans for it			1
they have won a grant to restore the entrance to its @entity26 glory with bazaars and underground attractions			1
pictured , the outline of the original staircase can still be seen clearly on the wall legendary : the chamber teemed with people as @entity18 , top , waved his hat to admirers after it opened			1
the two tunnels now take trains urban history : about 4,000 people have flocked to see the tunnel chamber since it was made safe , and it will now be given a full restoration by the @entity63 traffic : as the first footway under a navigable river , it was a huge relief to traders who claimed it could take longer to cross the @entity70 by boat than the @entity72			1
construction had to be abandoned in 1828 after the partially - built tunnel was totally flooded , almost killing @entity18			1
the tunnel opened in 1843 the double foot tunnel alleviated crisis congestion on the @entity70 , which merchants claimed could take longer to cross than the @entity72			0
in its heyday it hosted market stalls , fire - eaters , an infamous fundraising banquet when still part - finished , and later , unwanted prostitution			2
but the tunnels were converted to take trains in 1869 , leaving their 50ft - wide entrance redundant			2
they still take trains today and their shaft was completely inaccessible until recently , when the chamber was separated from the railway tracks for the first time with a £ 250,000 concrete floor			2
visitors must wriggle through a 4ft entrance passage before descending a tower of scaffolding onto the ground , where they can feel @entity101 trains rumbling below			0
@entity102 can reveal the @entity63 , which adjoins the site in @entity104 , @entity5 , has won a grant to restore a full entrance and permanent stairway into the shaft for the first time in 145 years , a move they hope will turn it into a major tourist attraction			1
the details of the grant have not yet been announced , but it is thought to be worth about £ 250,000 and the work can start as soon as next summer			0
a second phase worth £ 1 million will connect the shaft to the museum , in @entity18 's old boiler house			1
family affair : the tunnel was a joint project between the engineer @entity122 ( left ) and his son @entity18 ( right ) , who went on to achieve legend status impressive : @entity122 's first underwater tunnel in the world - which he built with his son @entity127 - is one of the most important sites in engineering history imprint : all that remains of the once - grand staircase into the tunnel shaft is this ridge along the wall			1
soon the 170 - year - old chamber will become a full tourist attraction tribute : one of the only items inside the chamber now is a statue of @entity18 looking up to the only source of light			1
right , visitors must descend a scaffolding tower squeeze : today the only way into the 42ft high tunnel shaft is to wriggle through an entrance passage , pictured , and down a scaffolding tower museum director @entity151 , 60 , said the money was ' in the bank '			1
he added : ' you take a @entity15 train anywhere in the world and your journey really began here			0
it 's the birthplace of the underground transport network and in that sense it 's the birthplace of the modern city			0
' they originally intended it for cargo , but they could n't afford the ramps to get the cargo into the tunnel			0
so what they opened was a cargo tunnel that could n't take any			0
' instead they turned it into a market			0
there was dancing and performing horses - @entity177 knows how they got the horses down there - along with sword swallowers , @entity184 serenaders and fire - eaters			0
' we 're going to convert this space into what it once was - a palace of delight and entertainment			1
' the gigantic , 1,000 - tonne circular shaft was built above ground and then sunk into the soft @entity5 earth before construction on the tunnels could start			2
the tunnels were revolutionary because they used the first ever tunneling shield , an iron box divided into 36 ' cells ' each containing a worker			0
it protected them as they dug out the soft earth and has since evolved into the tunnel boring machines used today			0
a previous attempt without a shield had to be abandoned in 1808 when it collapsed just 200ft from the end			0
revolutionary : the tunnel was the first to use a shield , an iron box divided into 36 ' cells ' each containing a worker which has evolved into modern tunneling machines grandiose : the tunnel hosted a fundraising banquet in 1827 , before it flooded			0
in the foreground are @entity122 and his son , the only known image of them together eighth wonder of the world : once the new attraction was finished it teemed with visitors , 50,000 of whom attended on its first day and a million in its first month history : a @entity101 worker inside the main section of the @entity9 , which still takes regular trains despite being the oldest of its kind in the world iconic : @entity18 went on to design the @entity238 suspension bridge , pictured , and has been named as one of the worthiest @entity240 in history digging under the @entity70 clay was still a dangerous business , however			1
workers could bear only two - hour shifts until they collapsed from exhaustion			0
the whole tunnel flooded midway through its construction in 1828 , killing six workers and very nearly handing @entity18 the same fate			2
legend has it the great engineer - who would go on to design the @entity238 suspension bridge - swam through the torrent as it rose until he was hauled unconscious from the exit			2
mr @entity151 is the only paid member of a team of volunteers which has spent years lobbying for the chamber 's restoration			2
his efforts have won the former teacher and actor the @entity265 , meaning he has the right to drive sheep across @entity268			0
though he added : ' i have n't exercised it yet ' .			0

@entity9 in south east @entity5 was built by legendary engineer @entity18 and his father @entity19
a million @entity26 thrillseekers descended through its grand entrance in its first month but it shut in 1869
*exclusive* : volunteers plan to give it a full restoration next year with a new stairway and @entity26 - themed attractions
museum director : ' we 're going to convert this space into what it once was - a palace of delight and entertainment '
the museum allows people into the chamber on *tuesday* evenings and sunday *mornings* . visit *brunel* - *museum.org.uk* .
