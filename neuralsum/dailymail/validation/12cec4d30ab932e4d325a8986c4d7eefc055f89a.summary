it is one of the most expensive cancer the @entity4 treats , yet receives only a fraction of cancer research funding			0
every year in the @entity8 , 10,000 people are diagnosed with bladder cancer , and of that half will die from the disease			1
but experts are today rallying behind a new campaign @entity13 , to raise awareness and vital funds to develop research			1
it comes as researchers at the @entity20 believe a new and simple test could help determine how aggressive a patient 's disease is , allowing doctors to tailor individual treatment plans			0
the scientists , who estimate treating the disease currently costs the @entity4 £ 65 million a year , found being able to reliably identify those patients with the most aggressive cancers early after diagnosis ' significantly improved outcomes '			1
they identified two biomarkers in the urine which they believe can predict a patient 's prognosis			0
a new campaign has been launched to raise public awareness of bladder cancer - the seventh most common cancer in the @entity8 and the form of the disease that costs the @entity4 most to treat at £ 65 million a year three charities , action on @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 are leading the campaign			1
it aims to raise funds to invest in bladder cancer research dr @entity52 , from the @entity20 , said : ' there is an urgent need for prognostic biomarkers that could guide patient management			1
' if such a test could be delivered , in a non-invasive way , it could make treatment much more efficient and that can only be a good thing			0
' the @entity64 campaign has been launched by three charities , action on @entity45 , fight @entity45 and @entity47			0
it aims to raise public awareness of the ' @entity68 ' , in a bid to prevent thousands of ' unnecessary ' deaths each year			1
@entity71 , chief executive of @entity47 ( @entity47 ) , said : ' at @entity47 we became very aware that bladder cancer is the @entity75 disease which people shy away from talking about			1
' we were receiving fewer applications for research into bladder cancer and wanted to make a push to encourage people to do more research into this area			1
' by working together with the other charities we believe we can create more awareness of the disease and hopefully provide more funding for research			0
' ' progress is being made but we need it to be made faster , ' she added			0
her colleague in the fight against bladder cancer , @entity91 , founder of @entity46 , and a patient of the disease himself , warned that the chances of surviving the disease are ' getting worse '			1
smoking is known to be the biggest cause of bladder cancer			1
the most common symptoms are blood in your wee , frequently needing a wee , recurring urinary infections and abdominal or back pain there are two main types of bladder cancer			1
non-invasive bladder cancer is where the disease develops only in the inner lining of the bladder			1
meanwhile invasive bladder cancer is where the cancer has spread into the deeper walls of the bladder			2
of more than 200 known cancers , bladder cancer ranks fifth most common in the western world			1
it is a disease that affects people regardless of age and sex , although it is recognised the chances of developing the disease increase as a person gets older			0
what causes bladder cancer ? smoking is by far the largest preventable cause of bladder cancer			2
other causes include exposure to specific industrial chemicals and dyes , as well as diesel fumes			0
studies have also suggested a hereditary link to bladder cancer			2
however , in almost half of cases experts still do not know what causes the disease			0
it is one of the reasons the @entity64 campaign team are attempting to raise more money to fund more extensive research			0
currently just 0.6 per cent of cancer research is spent on bladder cancer			2
the result is that treatments for the disease are much the same as they were 35 years ago			0
a spokesman for the campaign said : ' quite simply , the current treatments are not very good at preventing recurrence or stopping the cancer spreading and becoming fatal			2
' that is why it is still the most expensive cancer for the @entity4 to treat and it has the highest recurrence rate of any cancer			0
' the most common symptoms are : source : @entity64 he said : ' people affected by this cancer feel that they are being ignored			2
' there have not been any new treatments for more than 30 years			0
' despite being such a common cancer , so few people have ever heard of it , let alone know the causes or symptoms			2
' this needs to change which is why one main aim of the campaign is to get as many people as possible to start talking about bladder cancer			1
' consultant urologist , @entity190 , chair of @entity191 , added : ' i see every day the huge difference it can make to diagnose bladder cancer early , when its curable			2
' anything that raises public awareness of bladder cancer and therefore makes people seek help earlier is to be welcomed and if we raise money to support research into better treatment at the same time then all the better			1
' their quest comes as colleagues at @entity20 publish their study in the @entity210			0
they hope their findings will prove a vital step forward , paving the way for improved care for every bladder cancer patient			2
the researchers identified two markers in urine , by analysing specimens provided by volunteers			0
two prognostic urinary biomarkers were identified - epidermal growth factor receptor ( @entity223 ) and a protein , epithelial cell adhesion molecule ( @entity226 )			0
the scientists concluded therefore that measuring the biomarkers , could ' represent a simple and useful approach for fast - tracking the investigation and treatment of patients with the most aggressive bladder cancers '			2
they said the tests could prove useful for both newly - diagnosed patients as well as existing patients , who suffer a recurrence of the disease			1
in addition , by identifying patients with less aggressive forms of the disease , it may allow for fewer visits to specialists , and even discharging patients from specialist care sooner than expected			0

it comes as researchers at the @entity20 have identified two biomarkers in simple urine tests that could help doctors determine a patient 's prognosis , therefore helping to develop tailored treatment plans			0
the higher the number of biomarkers , the more aggressive a patient 's disease , pictured , is @entity274 , from the @entity20 , said : ' these biomarkers alone can not be used to diagnose bladder cancer , but there is immense value in being able to easily and independently indicate the prognosis of the disease in order to guide treatment and decide whether more or less aggressive management is required			1
' around 10,000 patients are diagnosed with bladder cancer every year , of which around half will die last week the @entity288 ( @entity288 ) published new guidelines to ensure bladder cancer patients receive the same level of treatment regardless of where they live			1
while it is thought to be one of the most expensive cancers to treat for the @entity4 , there is a wide variation in treatments offered across the country			0
the guidelines state information given to people diagnosed with the disease should be tailored to every individual 's needs			1
professor @entity307 , director of the @entity308 , said : ' bladder cancer is in the top 10 most common cancers in the @entity8			1
' there are a number of treatments available , but for some people a diagnosis is only made when they are admitted to hospital in an emergency - in these cases the outlook can be poor			0
' bladder cancer can have a profound impact on someone 's psychological wellbeing as well as their physical health			1
' both the tumours and the treatments can affect bowel , bladder and sexual function			0
' this guideline aims to give people all the information they need about bladder cancer , to help them to make better decisions about their care , and improve their quality of life during and after treatment			1

shout @entity344 campaign aims to raise awareness
' @entity347 £ 65 billion a year - more than other cancers
10,000 people are diagnosed in the @entity8 each year - half of those will die
it 's the 7th most common @entity8 cancer and 5th most common in the west
bladder cancer patients are more likely to suffer a recurrence than those suffering other types of cancer including breast , *prostate* , lung or bowel
