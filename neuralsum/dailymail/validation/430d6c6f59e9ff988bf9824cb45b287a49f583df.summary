growing trend : parents are increasingly pressuring doctors to delay vaccines for young children , raising the threat from preventable diseases such as the flu , measles and mumps , a new study suggests three - quarters of the doctors surveyed said they agreed to vaccine delays at least some of the time , even though they knew it was potentially harmful			1
