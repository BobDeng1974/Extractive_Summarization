@entity0 has received tens of thousands of pounds in donations from one of the law firms criticised over false claims @entity6 soldiers were involved in torture and murder in @entity9			1
@entity11 gave the party or its mps a total of £ 33,000 over two years , official records show			1
the law firm was criticised on wednesday after the £ 31million @entity17 inquiry found the shocking allegations were ‘ wholly and entirely without merit ’ and based on ‘ deliberate and calculated lies ’			1
in the letter , the @entity34 grandee described the legal action as ‘ vexatious and malicious ’			0
sir @entity28 added : ‘ it says everything about today ’s @entity0 that – rather than supporting our troops – they take donations from those who seek to undermine them			1
‘ @entity22 needs to forfeit this money immediately			1
otherwise people will conclude that he is a weak leader and utterly unfit to be prime minister			0
’ @entity0 said it would be inappropriate to comment while an investigation by the legal watchdog , the @entity51 , into the conduct of some of the lawyers , was still ongoing			2
official records show @entity55 gave £ 14,500 to @entity56 which was declared in her register of interests on december 8			1
miss @entity56 was a senior ally of mr @entity22 ’s and the shadow attorney general until she resigned over a ‘ sneering ’ row after posting on @entity64 a picture of a house with a white van outside during the @entity68 by - election			2
the donation was to pay for a legal research assistant for @entity73 ’s office			0
detained @entity74 being guarded by a @entity6 soldier that was shown at the @entity76			0
the long - running inquiry found that @entity6 troops mistreated nine @entity74 detainees following a fierce battle a decade ago , but false allegations of murder and torture were the product of ' deliberate lies ' @entity87 figures also show the firm gave £ 18,250 to pay for @entity0 staff costs in january 2012			1
another £ 875 was given for the same purpose six months later			2
sir @entity28 said mr @entity22 should make a ‘ suitable financial donation ’ to the work of @entity94 ‘ as an acknowledgment of previous poor judgment ’			2
in the letter he wrote : ‘ this would be the simplest way for you to clarify whether @entity0 are on the side of those who defend our country and our freedom or those who seek to undermine it			2
’ sir @entity28 said @entity0 should give all money received from @entity11 - criticised by the @entity109 - to armed forces charities another firm criticised after the inquiry was public interest lawyers , which is led by @entity114			1
in 2005 , he shared a platform at a meeting about ‘ alleged abuses in @entity9 ’ with @entity0 mp @entity118 , who is now the shadow justice secretary			1
the meeting in the @entity120 was held to discuss ‘ all cases of alleged torture , abuse or ill treatment by @entity6 armed forces in @entity9 ’			1
on wednesday the @entity17 probe exonerated @entity6 troops , saying the @entity74 men they were accused of torturing were not innocent farmers but insurgents killed or captured during a firefight , @entity132 , in 2004			0
ministers reacted with fury to the conclusions , with defence secretary @entity136 saying the claims were a ‘ shameful attempt to use our legal system to attack and falsely impugn our armed forces ’			0
a @entity0 spokesman said : ‘ as shadow defence secretary @entity142 made clear @entity0 supported the conclusion of the @entity27 inquiry which found that serious allegations made against @entity6 service personnel were wholly without foundation and that the failure of legal representatives to disclose evidence gave significant cause for concern			1
‘ @entity153 is now fully investigating whether there have been possible breaches of professional standards by the legal firms involved			0
‘ it would be completely inappropriate for us to comment further until this inquiry is complete			0
’ after the inquiry @entity55 said it was ‘ not responsible for representing the @entity74 at the @entity76 and were not asked by the @entity76 to disclose all relevant documents in our possession until august 2013			0
‘ the @entity171 document detailing the detainees association with the militia “ remained in our files until it was handed to the inquiry in september 2013 following a request from the team ”			0
‘ on this occasion we did not get things right			0
we have apologised to the @entity76 for not realising the significance of this document sooner			0
