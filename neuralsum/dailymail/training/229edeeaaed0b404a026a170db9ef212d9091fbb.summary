@entity2 , of @entity31 , was convicted at @entity32 in august of causing the dog unnecessary suffering			1
the twenty - eight year - old had been given @entity13 only six weeks before he died			0
at a previous court hearing @entity2 ’s solicitor @entity36 said she did not want to lose the right to keep a dog			1
sheriff @entity40 had deferred sentence until this week because social background reports on @entity2 had not addressed her suitability to care for animals in the future			1

' ms @entity90 said the social work report on @entity2 said she was a woman with a genuine fondness of animals but because of her personal circumstances was not able to react to her dog 's ill health			2
she said @entity2 was concerned ' there may be an order which affects her ownership of a dog			2
