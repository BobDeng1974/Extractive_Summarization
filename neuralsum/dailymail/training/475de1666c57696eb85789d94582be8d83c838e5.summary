this video shows the moment a living horse was held down and chopped up by a mob at a bullfight who saw the chance to get fresh horse meat in an incident described as ' disgusting '			1
the horse had been knocked over and injured after being attacked by a bull during a recent traditional bullfight in the town of @entity13 , in northern @entity14			1
the enraged ball had run off after injuring the horse , which was then surrounded by the crowd and held down			1
animal - rights activists @entity33 , who is a local campaigner against bullfights , said : ' this is something that should not go unpunished because we have evidence that the meat which was cut off the horse was on sale hours later in local butchers			1
' he added : ' if we allow this to go unpunished , then people with knives looking for something to eat might well become a regular happening at bullfights			2
' but lawyer @entity52 says the attackers had not broken any law and could only be punished if the owner of the horse made a complaint about damage to his property			2
and he added that it would almost certainly not result in a prison sentence			0
as soon as the horse falls over , a mob quickly swarms around it , with the animal unable to stand up outrage : @entity66 ( left ) , spokeswoman for animal rights group @entity67 , said the mayor who organised the event ' knows how serious the incident was ' , while @entity75 ( right ) , governor of the region where the bullfight took place , has condemned the slaughter of the horse @entity78 , mayor of @entity13 , who organised the bullfight claims that he was n't in attendance however the owner of the horse is believed to be an enthusiastic supporter of bullfights who was there on the animal to take part in the event , and has refused to complain			1
@entity88 , the local who filmed the incident and posted the video , said : ' today the bull attacked a horse and people armed with knives from inside the bullfight venue chopped the horse alive in front of the whole community			1
the video speaks for itself			0
' animal rights @entity67 said they will start legal action against mayor @entity78 for organising the event where the incident happened			0
spokeswoman @entity66 said : ' the mayor knows exactly how serious it was , after all he was present when it took place			0
' the mayor however has denied that he was there saying : ' the reality is that i was not there but we are going to follow all the usual judicial procedures and look at the facts before deciding what to do			0
' @entity75 , governor of @entity121 where @entity13 is located , said : ' i can only condemn what happened and i hope this behaviour will not repeat itself			0
the things that were done were extreme cruelty and an exemplary punishment is required			0
' @entity128 chief executive @entity127 told @entity129 : ' shocking and disgusting do n't even get close to describing this horrific footage			2
i am aghast both at the butchering of a horse whilst it was still alive and at the bull attack			1
no society in the world could defend such grim abuse , for entertainment , for the food chain or for any other reason			0
the @entity142 were built on the backs of horses and they deserve respect , not this barbaric treatment			1
' so far the people involved in the attack on the horse have not been identified by authorities .			2
