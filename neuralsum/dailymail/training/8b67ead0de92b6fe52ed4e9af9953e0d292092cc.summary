wind farms could be the key to stopping hurricanes devastating the @entity4 and costing billions of dollars of damage , researchers have claimed			2
a team at @entity7 simulated three of the biggest hurricanes ever to hit the @entity4 - @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 - and found turbines at at sea could dramatically reduce the amount of damage they caused			1
they found turbines reduced peak wind speeds by up to 92 mph , and storm surges by up to 79 %			1
the turbines slow the outer winds , which decreases wave height and reduces movement of air toward the center of the hurricane			0
this increases the central pressure , which in turn slows the winds of the entire hurricane and dissipates it faster			0
in the computer model , by the time @entity11 reached land , its simulated wind speeds had decreased by 36 - 44 meters per second ( between 80 and 98 mph ) and the storm surge had decreased by up to 79 percent			1
computer simulations by professor @entity28 showed the offshore farms could prevent billions of dollars in damages			0
' we found that when wind turbines are present , they slow down the outer rotation winds of a hurricane , ' @entity28 said			2
' this feeds back to decrease wave height , which reduces movement of air toward the center of the hurricane , increasing the central pressure , which in turn slows the winds of the entire hurricane and dissipates it faster			0
' the study , conducted by @entity28 , and @entity65 and @entity66 of the @entity67 , was published online in @entity68			0
researchers simulated three hurricanes : @entity9 and @entity10 , which struck @entity72 and @entity32 , respectively , in 2012 ; and @entity11 , which devastated @entity32 in 2005			1
in the case of @entity11 , @entity28 's model revealed that an array of 78,000 wind turbines off the coast of @entity32 would have significantly weakened the hurricane well before it made landfall			1
an aerial view of the damage around @entity82 , @entity83 in the aftermath of @entity9 : researchers believe that offshore wind farms could help hurricanes dissipate and reduce damage in the computer model , by the time @entity11 reached land , its simulated wind speeds had decreased by 36 - 44 meters per second ( between 80 and 98 mph ) and the storm surge had decreased by up to 79 percent			1
for @entity9 , the model projected a wind speed reduction by 35 - 39 meters per second ( between 78 and 87 mph ) and as much as 34 percent decrease in storm surge			1
@entity28 the reduction of hurricane damage cost and electricity production of the scheme could persuade stats to install it			0
@entity9 , for instance , caused roughly $ 82 billion in damage across three states			2
' the turbines will also reduce damage if a hurricane comes through , ' @entity28 said			0
' these factors , each on their own , reduce the cost to society of offshore turbines and should be sufficient to motivate their development			0
