by @entity1 reporter published : 17:15 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 17:15 est , 31 july 2013 a @entity3 film scholar has revealed in terrifying detail how @entity5 was at the whim of the @entity7 throughout the 1930s - censoring films and dropping others in a sinister collaboration with @entity11			2
in one particularly extreme case , one non-jewish @entity13 executive divorced his @entity16 wife at the demand of @entity19 's @entity18 - and she ended up in a concentration camp			1
in his new book , @entity21 has revealed how studios including @entity13 , @entity24 and @entity25 failed to stand up to @entity11 and painted his regime as heroic and desirable			1
' i want to bring out a hidden episode in @entity5 history and an episode that has not been reported accurately , ' the @entity3 scholar said			0
' collaboration ' : @entity11 's @entity19 leaders were in cahoots with @entity5 movie studios to make sure films painted them in a positive light , a @entity3 historian has claimed although other film historians dispite it , @entity21 said studio chiefs were happy to work with @entity19 censors to change or cancel productions so that they could keep access to the @entity46 film market			1
from 1932 , @entity19 laws meant studios could have their licenses revoked if they produced films , shown in @entity19 or abroad , that were considered offensive to @entity46			1
@entity21 believes that filmmakers not only wanted to continue working during the build up to the war , they also thought @entity11 may win the war and wanted to safeguard the future of their businesses			1
in his book , the collaboration : @entity5 's @entity61 with @entity11 , which has been excerpted in the @entity62 , in @entity63 said that @entity5 was happy to bow to @entity11 's demands			0
for example , when @entity66 was released in december 1930 , @entity65 told protesters to set off stink bombs and release mice in the movie theaters			0
it caused such disruptions throughout theaters that the films were stopped and it was eventually banned from the country , due to how @entity46 felt they had been depicted			1
orders : @entity66 was heavily edited after @entity46 theaters banned it for its negative portrayal of the country , while @entity82 was dropped from cinemas entirely protest : @entity65 ordered @entity46 to disrupt screenings of the film @entity66 , above @entity86 , the @entity16 @entity46 - @entity87 head of @entity88 , was so bothered that he edited a version that would not upset the @entity46			1
he traveled to @entity19 to present the film and was told that they would only put on the film if the edits were made to the movie before it showed in all other countries			2
the 1936 @entity13 movie @entity82 , which showed democracy winning over fascism , was also dropped			1
the film , based on @entity103 laureate @entity102 's novel , was banned over ' fear of international politics ' and the potential of boycotts abroad			2
also putting on the pressure was a diplomat named @entity110 , who became the @entity46 consul in @entity112 in 1933 and threatened the studios with an article in @entity19 's film regulations			1
it stated that all of a company 's movies would be banned from @entity19 if it was found distributing anti-german films anywhere in the world			0
movie critic : historian @entity21 has researched the reach of @entity19 influence on @entity5 before the war and believes that many of the studios bowed to business pressures from @entity19 the rule meant that some movies were canceled altogether - both once they had finished production and before they even got there			1
in one startling example of the reach of the @entity7 within @entity5 , a film about the treatment of @entity16 in @entity19 that was created by @entity138 - who would later write @entity140 - and producer @entity141 never went ahead			2
despite the determination of the two movie makers , every studio turned them down on the belief that @entity19 would ban all @entity87 films if it were made			0
when it was handed over to a well - known agent , @entity150 , he also struggled to get executives to give money to the project			0
in the mid- 1930s , relationships between studios and prominent nazis grew and @entity24 hired a manager for its @entity46 branch , @entity159 , who was a member of the @entity161			1
it was at the time that the head of @entity13 in @entity19 , @entity164 , divorced his @entity16 wife at the request of the @entity18			1
war years : @entity13 is one of the studios @entity21 says collaborated with @entity19 they paid attention to workers too ; @entity46 composers dubbed music originally created by @entity16 musicians , while names were slashed from credits if they had dealt with anti-nazi films in the past			1
the historian also found a letter from january 1938 in which a @entity25 worker was asking @entity11 about his views on films			0
the letter was signed ' @entity11 '			0
this collaboration between @entity5 and the @entity7 lasted well into 1940 but as the war continued , the studios found it nearly impossible to distribute their pictures in @entity189 and @entity190			0
and in turn they were less concerned with the relatively minor @entity46 market			1
@entity13 , @entity24 and @entity25 did not leave @entity19 until mid- 1940			2
but even after @entity5 started making anti-nazi films , it continued to erase references to the @entity16 because studio chiefs , including @entity16 refugees , wanted to ' avoid special pleading on their behalf '			0
@entity21 said studio bosses could not claim ignorance of the atrocities being carried out against the @entity16 because they had been forced to fire @entity16 employees			2
censor : propaganda minister @entity65 talks to the @entity204 in @entity205 in 1935 screen test : @entity11 was not amused at @entity208 's performance in the great dictator @entity11 was said to have enjoyed films such as @entity211 and @entity212			0
he also liked mr @entity213 goes to @entity214 , because it showed democracy in a poor light			0
and while he is said to have liked @entity218 , @entity11 was not keen on @entity208 's portray of him in @entity220 , according to the @entity221			0
however , rival historian @entity222 claims that @entity87 commerce department files show that rather than working with the @entity7 , @entity13 had been advised to invest in armaments to get around currency being blocked			2
' i do n't see sinister , greedy monsters			0
i see people trying to cope with this bizarre anomaly and negotiate in a way that made sense to them , ' the author of @entity5 and @entity229 : 1933 - 1939 , said .			0

@entity21 says film *industry* failed to stand up to censorship
@entity13 invested in @entity46 *rearmament* to get around *export* *restrictions*
