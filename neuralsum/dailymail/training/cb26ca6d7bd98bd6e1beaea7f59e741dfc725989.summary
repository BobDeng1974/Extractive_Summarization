by @entity0 @entity1 must be quaking in her @entity2			1
@entity3 launched her very own lifestyle blog , just like @entity1 's @entity5 , and now she 's gone and launched a new designer fragrance campaign on the same day as her fellow @entity8 actress			1
@entity9 has been the face of @entity12 fragrances for several seasons and dazzles in the new campaign imagery for @entity15			1
wearing a glittering gold dress and with her hair in tumbling waves , the @entity16 star oozes old school @entity21 glamour			1
wow ! @entity23 has just been unveiled as the face of @entity12 's latest fragrance and she oozes old school @entity21 glamour in the campaign speaking about the new scent , @entity30 , @entity12 ’s creative director , said : ' in the new @entity33 , there is a charming balance of jasmine sambac and @entity36 rose , two classically elegant feminine flowers that are contrasted with delicate freesia			1
the result is a vibrant , modern feminine scent that you can enjoy wearing every day			2
' @entity9 added : ' you spray it and you immediately feel empowered - there ’s a sensuality that comes with fragrance and there ’s a power that fragrance has on other people			1
' but while @entity52 represents a red carpet moment or a big night out , the new @entity51 version is softer			2
it has all the great presence of the original , but dialled down and freshened up			2
you really can wear it as your everyday fragrance			2
' what a difference ! while @entity9 has been attempting to emulate @entity1 's lifestyle blog , the stars new campaigns could n't be more different			1
@entity1 looks natural and pared - back in her shoot for @entity64 pour @entity65 @entity1 , meanwhile , has just been unveiled as the face of @entity67 pour @entity65 , inspired by a woman who stops and pauses to enjoy the simple things in life			1
@entity23 launched her foray into the online world of lifestyle blogging on monday promising to be a younger more hip - and slightly less expensive - version of the fellow actress 's long running site , @entity5			1
the 26 - year - old 's part blog - part store also ended up with a slightly gloopy name , specifically the jelly - inspired @entity79			1
new role : @entity23 launched her foray into the online world of cool on monday with a new lifestyle site called @entity84 the @entity16 star has previously avoided calling the site a lifestyle one , but just like @entity1 's , @entity9 's offers a host of stories about cool clothes , places , foods and fashion scenes			1
cue videos of artsy snippets , stories on tattooed men and organic health remedies and , of course , a store which sells everything from spoons to clothing and hot sauces to lighting options			0
the actress has been speaking of the project for months and now it is finally here , @entity9 was at pains to point out that she is not being a star trying to show people how to live like her , but merely pointing out how people live already			2
buying the cool factor : @entity9 's site offers a host of stories about clothes , places , foods , fashion scenes and , of course , a store which sells everything from spoons to clothing and hot sauces to lighting options not all about @entity9 : the @entity16 star was at pains to point this is not the star trying to show people how to live like her but how people live already as the name suggests , while using the modern medium of the internet , she wants her page to harken back to the small batch jam making times of yesteryear including things like preserving and promoting underground designers and produce			1
confused ? well that 's alright , so is @entity9			1
evolving : the 26 - year - old wife of @entity143 , pictured last month , happily admits in her first editor 's letter this is a learning curve for her the 26 - year - old wife of @entity143 happily admits in her first @entity147 that this is something of a learning curve for her			2
she writes : ' sitting down to write this editor ’s letter has been the hardest thing i 've done yet on my @entity84 journey			0
' i ’m more intimidated than i should probably admit			0
i ’m no editor , no artisan , no expert			0
and certainly no arbiter of what you should buy , wear , or eat			0
' i am hungry , though ... not just for enchiladas			0
i 'm hungry for experience			0
' i 'm comfortable with the knowledge that i 'm not a teacher , but rather , a student			0
i do n't do any one thing perfectly			0
i do a lot of things though			0
some well , some not - so - well			0
' according to @entity9 , she and her team think of the site not as a lifestyle website but a ' new street			1
' ' a sort of greatest hits of " @entity174 , @entity173 "			0
while the whole world races to keep up with technology , we tighten our laces , join the race , but our end goal is to preserve what 's already there			2
' the function of @entity84 is part magazine , part e-commerce hub , part philanthropic endeavour and - above all - a place to showcase the power of imagination , ingenuity , quality , and ( simply put ) people			0
' @entity84 is a creative space			0
a space for pleasure and fun			0
but also a space for knowledge			0
a space that honours both tradition and innovation - a space that honours the future , while having a love affair with the past ... ' however , now that they both have lifestyle sites , do n't expect @entity9 to start a war with @entity1			1
the @entity16 star recently name dropped her fellow online retail blogger , telling @entity212 she is always in both the actress 's and @entity215 's corner			2
@entity9 said : ' i ’m always the first person to defend @entity1			1
or any woman in a position of power , like @entity215 or @entity220 , who gets burned			0
because they have paved the path for so many other women who are doing something they believe in			0
' @entity225 : according to @entity9 , she and her team think of the site not as a lifestyle website but a ' new street ' which promotes small designers and produce			1
