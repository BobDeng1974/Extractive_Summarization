when inventor @entity1 created his ' @entity3 ' concept in 2000 , everyone laughed at his design			1
@entity5 claimed the quantum vacuum plasma thruster went against the laws of physics , as did many others in the scientific community			1
but now the space agency has found out that the fuel - free space drive , once described as ' impossible ' , actually works - it is just not sure why			1
the engine , called @entity3 , is relatively simple			1
it provides thrust to a spacecraft by bouncing microwaves around in a closed container			1
solar energy provides the electricity to power the microwaves , which means that no propellant is needed			1
the implications for this could be huge			2
for instance , current satellites could be half the size they are today without the need to carry fuel			2
solar energy provides the electricity to power the microwaves , which means that no propellant is needed.the implications for this could be huge			2
for instance , current satellites could be half the size they are today without the need to carry fuel humans could also travel further into space , generating their own propulsion on the way			0
when @entity60 - based @entity1 came up with concept , the only team that took him seriously was a group of @entity63 scientists			1
in 2009 , the team allegedly produced 720 millinewton ( or 72g ) of thrust , enough to build a satellite thruster			2
but still , nobody believed they had achieved this			0
now @entity71 - based scientist @entity70 and his team at @entity73 have published a paper that demonstrates that a similar engine works on the same principles			1
their model , dubbed @entity79 , produces much less thrust at 30 to 50 micronewtons - less than a thousandth of the output of some relatively low - powered ion thrusters used today			2
@entity5 is yet to explain why its engine works			1
this could mean that either the results are wrong , or the space agency has confirmed a breakthrough in space propulsion			0
a functioning man - made leaf that absorbs water and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen , just like natural leaves , has been created by an art graduate			0
the new material could provide a steady source of oxygen for humans on long missions in space and even help us colonise new planets			0
@entity103 claims that the leaves could also transform life on @entity106 as we know it , because buildings could be clad with the material to oxygenate homes and polluted urban areas			0
the @entity112 graduate told @entity113 that @entity5 is researching ways to ensure a supply of oxygen over long journeys so that people can live in space , but that plants do n't grow in zero gravity			1
this material could allow us to explore space much further than we can now , ' he said			0
mr @entity103 claims that he has made the ' first photosynthetic material that is living and breathing as a leaf does			0
' mr @entity103 says that his material consumes very little energy and as a result he thinks it could be incorporated into modern buildings , to absorb carbon dioxide			0
it could be used to clad facades , ventilation systems , he said			0
' you can absorb air from outside , pass it through these biological filters and then bring oxygenated air inside			0

concept for the *spacedrive* was put *forward* by @entity1 in 2000
the engine , called @entity3 , is relatively simple . it provides thrust to a spacecraft by bouncing microwaves around in a closed container
at the time @entity5 and others said it went against the law of physics
@entity5 has now shown that a similar engine works on the same principles
