@entity5 was bitten near the historic @entity49 and it was not until the day after , when he started limping badly , that he was taken to the vets and the adder bite was spotted under his long hair			1

but when the swollen leg was shaved the bite was discovered			0
he was bitten four weeks ago but his condition deteriorated , eventually suffering kidney failure , and he died on saturday when he was put down by vets			1
she said : ' we were just walking around and he was off his lead and he was going in the long grass , i think that must be where it happened			0
' it is very long grass and he is a bit clumsy , i think he had probably stood on the adder			0
' when we got home i noticed that he was limping , i thought it was his arthritis but his leg had really swollen up			0
' i took him to the vets and she initially thought that he had broken his leg but after the x-ray she called and said that it was n’t broken			0
' when she shaved all his hair she saw the two horizontal bite marks and she thought he had been bitten by an adder			2
' obviously what has happened is the poison had caused him to have kidney failure			1
at first the vet gave him penicillin , antibiotics and anti inflammatory but he was being sick after the medications			0
' it was very serious and the vet had to give him injections because he was n’t eating and then he was put on a drip			2
' it was heartbreaking to see him like that , he could n’t even get up the stairs he was that frail			0
i just looked at him and i thought he ca n’t go on any longer			0
