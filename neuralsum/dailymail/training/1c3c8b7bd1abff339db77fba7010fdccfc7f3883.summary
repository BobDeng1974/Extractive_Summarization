in one corner , gamers were astounded by its undeniable beauty			2
in the other , the short , button - mashing playable demo at this year 's @entity6 left many thinking @entity0 was a case of all style but no substance			1
you play @entity11 , a young @entity12 soldier whose family is murdered by barbarian bandits			2
fuelled by revenge , @entity11 enlists in the @entity12 army , travelling to @entity17 and rising through the ranks to become leader of one of the deadliest military forces in history			2
photorealistic ? thanks to @entity24 , the powerhouse that fuelled @entity26 3 , facial detail across the board is truly next - gen powered by the @entity24 , gameplay revolves around third - person hacking and slashing			1
hammering different buttons unleashes unique combos , while certain moves trigger @entity35 events for brutal finishing attacks			2
it 's a tried and tested formula but the level of detail in the brutality is something current - gen consoles have never been able to capture			1
using advanced @entity45 animation , you 'll see the anger in your foes eyes as they charge at you			0
their determination as they swing a sword frantically at your head			0
and their fear when they stare at your sword hurtling towards their mid-section			0
what 's perhaps even more impressive is that this attention to detail is n't lost on a larger scale			0
every soldier on the screen is painstakingly animated - not just floating vaguely in the background			1
add to the mix @entity69 's @entity68 hardware that manipulates lighting , the environment and other effects in real - time , and you 've got an incredibly life - like interpretation of battles in that period			1
perhaps less realistic are @entity11 's movements during combat			0
there 's a clever multi-directional attack function - allowing you to take on more than one enemy , but @entity11 ' glides ' around like he 's on an ice rink			1
hit detection , too , needed some work			0
@entity88 , sweet @entity88 : although the demo focused sly on action , gamers can expect an enthralling story @entity0 is also @entity93 and @entity94 compatible			1
through @entity93 , you can command your troops in real time via voice recognition technology , while @entity94 lets you launch the game where you left off			1
as well as upgrading your character , the in - game @entity100 lets players review and share the best experiences from their game directly from their tablet , while context - sensitive achievements and guides help you unlock as many secrets as possible			1
anyone who played the @entity112 demo will know just how far away that is from the full game			2
it was so much more than simply killing zombies			0
xbox fans will hope the same applies to @entity0			0
@entity0 is an @entity119 exclusive launch title			0
let us know what you think on @entity123 : @ @entity124 and on @entity125 : @entity126 .			0

powered by @entity24 - behind @entity128
