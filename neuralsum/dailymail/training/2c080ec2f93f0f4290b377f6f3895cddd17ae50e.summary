a pensioner has been quite literally strumming the pounds away thanks to her unique method of dieting			1
@entity3 , from @entity4 , has helped herself lose 4st by picking up her ukulele to stave off temptation by playing ' @entity7 '			1
the 64 - year - old plays the @entity10 folk classic , which is associated with the cartoon character @entity12 , on repeat to avoid boredom and turning to snacks			2
@entity3 successfully utilized playing the ukulele to help her drop from 18st 7lb ( left ) to 14st ( right ) @entity3 used to use lots of butter , cream and oil in her cooking , as well as more processed foods ( pictured at her heaviest ) ' i must have played that song over a million times , ' said mrs @entity3			1
' it is the only one i know and i just play it over and over again when i am bored			1
i do n't ever crave food but when i am bored , i just seemed to eat			1
playing the ukulele has really defeated the boredom but it has driven my husband to despair			1
' i even continue playing it when it out of tune and it sounds absolutely dreadful			2
@entity37 will just come in and look at me and shake his head			0
we all call him ' @entity40 ' now ' mrs @entity3 , who decided to lose weight after undergoing a quadruple heart bypass last year , has managed to drop from 18st 7lb to under 14st and intends to keep losing the pounds			0
as well as losing the weight , @entity3 says she now has so much more energy ( left , before her weight loss , right , now ) in an effort to relieve her husband 's suffering she is now practising ' he 's got the @entity48 in his hands ' and a festive favourite for the @entity52 period in ' @entity53 '			1
@entity3 combined her ukulele playing with going to @entity55 in order to lose the pounds			1
she is now attempting to learn two new songs to alleviate husband @entity37 's despair mrs @entity3 said : ' i went to @entity55 and it 's been excellent for me			1
it showed me how to eat properly and showed me an easy way to live my life			0
