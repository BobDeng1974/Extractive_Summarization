thirteen of the carnivorous creatures reportedly hatched at the @entity6 starting january 2			2
an additional trio are said to be now pecking away at their potato - sized eggs in a bid to join the world			2
' it certainly is significant , any institution that is producing dragons , ' @entity24 of the @entity25 told @entity28 in @entity7			2
' for very many years , @entity30 zoos had dragons but they were n't successfully reproduced until the early 90s			1
' the births represent the third time the @entity6 has successfully bred komodo dragons in a little more than a year			1
the @entity28 reports that fewer than 20 @entity30 zoos have bred komodo dragons in captivity , and fewer than half that tiny number have succeeded in performing the trick at least twice			1
the proud parents are reportedly @entity40 , a 15 - year - old @entity14 dragon who resided at the @entity6 since 2005 and @entity43 , a nine - year - old dragon who 's been there for approximately the last five years			1
' we 've already got a list of other zoos that want @entity14 dragons , ' @entity63 , assistant curator of reptiles for the @entity6 told @entity28			1
' at this point , it 's just a matter of making sure everyone 's healthy , which they are			0
it 'll depend on the duration of time before we ship			0
if they 're going to hang out for two or three months , we may well get some on display			0
' the komodo dragon is indigenous to several @entity82 islands , and can grow to as much as 150 pounds in weight and 10 feet long			0
big fella : @entity86 dragons are said to be the largest lizard in the world , growing to about 10 feet long and 150 pounds in size rare feat : while most zoos have never bred a @entity92 in captivity , the @entity6 ( pictured ) has accomplished the feat three times in little more than a year predator : @entity97 to @entity82 , the komodo dragon is said to primarily feed on carrion , although it will prey upon live birds , deer , and even attack a human , if provoked the komodo dragon is reportedly the largest - living species of lizard on the globe , and feasts on mammals , like deer , as well as birds and invertebrates			1
the lizard has been known to attack human beings in rare cases			2
the newborns reportedly have a tough time ahead of them , as their very own mother might try to devour them if they are n't ready for action			0
" they 'll bite , first day out of the egg , " @entity63 told @entity28			0
' she 'll eat them if she can catch them			0
... when they hatch out of the egg , they have to be ready to go right then			0

few @entity30 zoos have managed to breed the endangered species in captivity
@entity6 accomplishes rare feat three times in little more than a year
other zoos - eager to exhibit them - have already claimed the *critters*
