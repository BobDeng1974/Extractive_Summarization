if humans worked together as well as ants , we might be more productive			0
the creatures have long been known to work collectively to protect nests from predators and even to form life rafts in the event of a flood			1
but now they have been caught on camera forming ' daisy chains ' to pull a large dead millipede to their colony			1
the behaviour has never been seen before and scientists are struggling to explain it			1
the behaviour has never been seen before and scientists are struggling to explain it @entity29 footage shows a species of ants called @entity32 making a chain to transport the heavy burden , somewhere in south east @entity35			1
@entity32 is a very common type of ant that can be found in tropical and sub-tropical climates around the world			1
@entity39 , an entomologist at @entity40 at @entity41 told the @entity42 that the daisy - chain strategy used by the ants has not been seen before			1
@entity45 , a phd student at the @entity46 , is an expert in cooperative transport strategies in ants and has recently published a paper detailing 40 genera of the creatures that work together to bring food back to their nests			1
strategies range from two ants carrying a leaf together , to weaver ant workers banding together to carry bats and even snakes up tree trunks			2
unique ? @entity45 , a phd student at the @entity46 , is an expert in cooperative transport strategies in ants said the ant 's daisy chain technique is special because they are grabbing on to one another instead of food , as seen here with leaf cutters carrying pieces of greenery @entity71 ants work together to jointly squirt foul - smelling liquid when they sense a threat overhead – such as a hungry bird			1
the formic acid is not harmful to humans and has the same odour as vinegar			0
however , it is enough to scare off larger predators such as woodpeckers and jay birds , who could wreak havoc on an ant nest – but the attack must be launched cohesively to have the desired effect			0
in the event of flooding , fire ants self - assemble into life - preserving raft using different body parts , including their claws and mandibles			1
engineers and mathematicians at @entity98 found the tiny creatures linked their bodies together in a similar way to how waterproof fabric is woven			0
an individual ant ’s exoskeleton is moderately hydrophobic so it can shrug off water , but the ants enhance their water repellence by linking their bodies together			2
‘ to me , this behaviour seems to be different from what 's been observed in other ants ( including the weaver ants ) in an important way , ’ she told the publication			2
‘ these @entity32 are moving their prey by grasping onto ants , instead of all grasping onto the prey itself			1
' one could argue that the chains occur because ants just grab onto anything attached to the prey they are trying to move , but i do n't think that 's what 's going on here			2
' ms @entity45 pointed out that ants are very good at telling the difference between their own species and anything else , so it would not be a mistake			0
individual ants may not be intelligent , but when the creatures work together as a colony , they can achieve herculean feats , whether that is launching a coordinated acid attack on a threatening bird , or manoeuvring a hefty piece of food into a small hole			2
biologists sometimes refer to the animals as a superorganism – a species that can only be appreciated in a group rather than as individuals			0
for example , @entity71 ants work together to jointly squirt foul - smelling liquid when they sense a threat overhead – such as a hungry bird			2
the formic acid is not harmful to humans and has the same odour as vinegar			0
however , it is enough to scare off larger predators such as woodpeckers and jay birds , who could wreak havoc on an ant nest – but the attack must be launched cohesively to have the desired effect			0
ants work together to survive in more peaceful ways too			0
in the event of flooding , fire ants self - assemble into life - preserving raft using different body parts , including their claws and mandibles			1
dead useful : the video footage shows a species of ants called @entity32 making a chain to transport the heavy burden , somewhere in south east @entity35			1
other species of ants collect dead insects ad transport them - but they don ; t use daisy chains			1
here , ants transport a piece of a dead bristle worm in @entity190 engineers and mathematicians at @entity98 found the tiny creatures linked their bodies together in a similar way to how waterproof fabric is woven			2
an ant ’s exoskeleton is moderately hydrophobic so it can shrug off water , but the ants enhance their water repellence by linking their bodies together			0
the researchers froze the fire ants to observe that they construct rafts when placed in water by gripping each other with mandibles , claw and adhesive pads at a force 400 times their body weight			1
the result was a viscous and elastic material that is almost like a fluid composed of ant ‘ molecules , ’ they said			0
the ants spread out from a sphere into a pancake - shaped raft that resisted submerging them in water			0
it ’s a real thrill unravelling what at first looks like chaos , ’ professor @entity221 from the university said			0
‘ to understand what the individual behaviours are and how they combine in order to achieve the function of the group is the central puzzle one encounters when studying social insects			0

behaviour has not been seen before and experts are struggling to explain it
footage shows @entity32 ants forming a daisy chain in south east @entity35
@entity244 said it is **unusual** for ants to form chains using their own bodies to carry food - instead of gripping their dinner
from protecting nests to forming life rafts in floods , *numerous* types of **unusual** collective behaviour has been *documented* in ants
