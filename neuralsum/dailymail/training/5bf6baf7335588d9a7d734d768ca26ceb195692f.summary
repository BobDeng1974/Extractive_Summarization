by @entity0 published : 11:22 est , 25 july 2012 updated : 04:05 est , 26 july 2012 @entity1 contacted 91 of @entity3 's 151 @entity2 - 56 % of them reported a decrease in the number of surgeries offering extended opening hours nearly 500 more gp surgeries across @entity3 have closed their doors at weekends and evenings , fuelling a million extra visits to over-stretched @entity11 departments			1
some patients are being forced to wait up to three weeks to get a basic appointment with their gp , according to figures			0
and the number of patients forced to languish in hospital corridors for four hours or more has also doubled			2
there has been a 5.7 per cent drop in the number of clinics offering out - of - hours appointments in the last year			1
only 11 bodies governing @entity25 reported an increase in surgeries seeing patients after hours			1
the figures , released by @entity1 ’s ‘ @entity30 ’ , were based on the responses of 91 of the @entity32 and extrapolated to give an estimate for all of @entity3			1
they come a month after some @entity25 took industrial action over the future of their pensions			0
before the last election , @entity38 said patients should be able to get a @entity14 appointment until 8pm , seven days a week			0
but @entity1 shadow health secretary @entity42 said : ‘ the prime minister promised patients would be able to get evening appointments with their gp , but our figures show things are heading in the opposite direction – with almost five hundred more surgeries now shutting earlier			2
‘ @entity50 revealed a major fall in the number of @entity25 ’ surgeries offering evening and weekend appointments – leaving patients unable to see their gp at a convenient time and with some people waiting up to three weeks for an appointment			1
’ mr @entity42 added that the government ’s ‘ calamitous ’ decision to overhaul the @entity30 had allowed the system to drift			0
@entity42 said @entity38 broke his pre-election pledge that all patients would be able to see their local gps until ' 8pm seven days a week ' the @entity64 also stopped the national monitoring of @entity14 surgeries ’ opening hours , which critics said sent the wrong signal to the @entity30			0

last night , the @entity75 hit back at the figures , claiming @entity1 had inflated its numbers on corridor waiting times by comparing six months of last year ’s emergency room waiting times with 12 months of this year ’s			0
a spokesman said : ‘ it is more than a bit rich for the @entity1 to lecture this government on access to gps out of hours when it was their disastrous gp contract which meant that 90 per cent of surgeries stopped offering this service altogether			1
’ there are 8,228 gp practices in @entity3 , according to the latest figures .			2

half of @entity3 ’s @entity2 reported a decrease in the number of gp surgeries offering care outside *normal* working hours last year
