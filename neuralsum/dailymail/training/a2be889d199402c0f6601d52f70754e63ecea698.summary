truth : mrs @entity28 said she was pleased ' the truth has been told ' at the inquest , but says she has still not come to terms with the tragedy he added : ‘ there was no evidence of a formal risk assessment of a fully - dressed diver moving from the seated position to the point of entry into the water			1
it was our recommendation to conduct a thorough review of the safety arrangements to minimise risk to divers as they prepare to enter the water			0
‘ the severity of the injuries was such that if he had not dived , his condition would have still reached serious medical emergency level			0
’ mr @entity25 told the inquest he was satisfied with the safety arrangements on his boats and had no plans to alter them			0
