@entity0 is developing a ‘ see - through ’ car that gives drivers the sense of @entity5 - style ‘ x-ray eyes ’ to look beyond the metal at what dangers lurk beneath their vehicles			1
the system combines cameras in the grille and jet - fighter - style head - up display technology on the windscreen to create the appearance of a ‘ transparent ’ bonnet			1
although designed principally for those who want to better spot rocky terrain or deep crevices when they take their @entity23 seriously off - road , it could even have some use in the urban jungle by allowing drivers to spot and avoid potholes lurking just out of sight			1
@entity0 bosses said the system is being developed to give @entity0 drivers a ‘ digital vision ’ of the terrain ahead by making the front of the car ‘ virtually invisible ’ and is expected to become an option on future models			1
the system acts like an electronic periscope to project image from below the car onto the windscreen in front of the driver			0
cameras in the vehicle ’s grille capture mobbing pictures of the state of the road or terrain immediately ahead			1

cameras in the vehicle ’s grille capture mobbing pictures of the state of the road or terrain immediately ahead			1
this video image is then transmitted digitally to a @entity75 of the type already used on many luxury and executive cars to project sat - nav and speed details onto the windscreen			2
the virtual image of the ground is superimposed over the actual image of the bonnet			0
this allows the driver to look through the windscreen and apparently ‘ see - through ’ the front of the car			2

the virtual image of the ground is thus superimposed over the actual image of the bonnet			0
this allows the driver to look through the windscreen and apparently ‘ see - through ’ the front of the car and its engine bay onto the road below , as if with x-ray eyes			1
the technology has been called @entity102 by its creators and is expected to be offered as an option on future models			0
a @entity0 spokesman said : ‘ the technology provides full visibility of what is underneath and in front of the car , with total clarity of otherwise hidden obstacles			2
’ he added : ‘ it enables a driver climbing a steep incline or manoeuvring in a confined space to see an augmented reality view capturing not only the terrain in front of the car but also the angle and position of the front wheels			2

cameras in the vehicle 's grille capture mobbing pictures of the state of the road or terrain immediately ahead ‘ it breaks new ground in visual driver assistance			1
and it shows how advanced technology will take @entity0 ’s unrivalled capability to the next level			0
’ @entity146 ’s director of research and technology dr @entity149 said : ‘ as our vehicles become more capable and autonomous off - road , we will ensure the driver has the confidence to allow the car to continue to progress , over any terrain			1
‘ we are developing new technologies including the @entity102 to give drivers an augmented view of reality to help them tackle anything from the toughest off - road route to the tight confines of an urban car park			1
’ dr @entity149 said : ‘ we believe the next 25 years will be the most exciting and dynamic the automotive industry has ever experienced			0
there will be huge strides in environmental innovation , in safety and capability			0
’ a spokesman said : ’ it demonstrates @entity0 ’s design vision for a future family of premium sports utility vehicles built on our key principles of emotive design , unrivalled capability and ultimate versatility			0
‘ from the city to the sand dunes , @entity0 ’s new , driver - assisting technology will enable safer , smarter and more enjoyable driving in the suvs of tomorrow			2

@entity187 combines cameras in the grille with jet - fighter - style displays on the windscreen to create the appearance of a ‘ transparent ’ bonnet
it has been designed for drivers who want to spot rocky terrain off - road
it could also help city drivers see and avoid potholes that are hidden
technology is to be showcased next week at the @entity38 on a prototype off - roader called ‘ @entity40 ’
