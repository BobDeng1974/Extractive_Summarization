the loss of a @entity3 man 's cat spurred him to make sure other pet owners never went through the same pain he felt when his feline ' best friend ' , @entity8 , went missing			1
for the past year , @entity9 , 33 , has been developing a @entity11 pet tracker that is believed to be the smallest , lightest and fully waterproof in the world			1
@entity13 , which is a size of a cork and weighs just 29 grams , is cylindrical and can be strapped onto a pet to track its movements			2
the idea for the @entity37 came about when mr @entity9 , from @entity38 , lost his tabby cat and best friend , @entity8 , in 2013			1
he said for three days he was ' distraught ' and hoping his cat of two years would return			0
' [ @entity8 ] was just everything to me			0
he was so cool , ' mr @entity9 told @entity44			2
@entity8 went missing in 2013 and was later found dead on the side of the road by a stranger mr @entity9 and his partner decided to crowdfund some of the development of the tracker so far , the campaign has raised more than $ 100,000 , which is double their initial goal ' we used to hangout in cafes and he used to ride on the motorbike with me to work			1
' unfortunately for mr @entity9 , @entity8 was not found alive			2
' i was notified by a note pinned to a tree that said a person had found beautiful tabby cat on the side of the road , ' mr @entity9 said			1
' it was the most heart - wrenching thing , you never get to say goodbye properly			0
' i 'm not saying the @entity37 would have saved @entity8 , but it would have helped me make sure he was safe			0
' it would have allowed me to find him straight away and be there for him			0
' mr @entity9 has described @entity8 as the ' coolest cat in the world ' and his ' best friend ' @entity8 would ride on mr @entity9 's motorbike and chill out with him at cafes the tabby cat had only been with mr @entity9 for two years before he went missing the pod uses gps technology which allows pets in another state or country to be detected via an application on a mobile phone or computer			1
mr @entity9 - who had previous experience with gps technology - said a lot of his money and his team 's had gone into readying the product for launch , including research and development , product design and initial testing			1
the money raised by crowdfunding was for the mass production of the @entity37 to ensure the device was in people 's hands by @entity101 as well as improving it			2
mr @entity9 said he was blown away by the support he had received for the project			1
anybody backing what you have created and supporting you , it matters a lot to me , ' he said			0
' it 's a real passion project			0
it 's not something i 've come up with randomly			0
' the 33 - year - old said they were also looking to align themselves with a charity so proceeds can also go to them .			0

@entity3 's @entity9 developed the @entity13 after he lost his cat in 2013
the pod is a gps tracker for pet owners to locate their lost *animals*

a crowdfunding campaign has raised more than $ 100,000 for the product
