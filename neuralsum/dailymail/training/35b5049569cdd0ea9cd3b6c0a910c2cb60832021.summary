a @entity1 college student recently conducted a social experiment to see if people treated her differently if she wore a hijab - a traditional @entity6 veil that covers a woman 's head and chest - and what she discovered was a bit unexpected			1
@entity12 , a third - year student at @entity13 in @entity14 , wore the traditional @entity6 garb for 18 days in january as she worked at the university 's library , visited stores and restaurants near the campus and as she did volunteer work with local children			1
according to @entity12 - who conducted the experiment to see if people in her community were racist towards minority groups - she noticed that people actually treated her more kindly and with more respect than when she did n't wear the hijab			1
experiment : @entity12 wore a hijab for 18 days to see how she was treated by other people @entity12 , who is not @entity6 , wrote about her experience wearing traditional @entity6 clothing in the march edition of the @entity37 , where she works as a copy editor - the article is titled ' overt to @entity40			1
' ' at first i thought i was just imagining things			0
there 's no way this is actually happening , ' @entity12 told the @entity46			2
' i went with my hijab and people were very nice , people were polite , parents would shake my hand , so the experience was all across the board in @entity54			2
' in some cases , she says , she would go out with friends who were n't wearing any identifying religious symbols and she was treated much nicer than they were			2
' there was this excess ( of niceness ) that i would experience that i could n't account for , ' she said			0
' like really going the extra mile like smiling broadly and being so so polite , which i 've never experienced before			0
it was a stark contrast that was going on that threw me for a loop			0
' @entity12 , who is @entity67 but not @entity6 , was inspired to wear the hijab by a similar social experiment conducted in the @entity70 @entity12 discussed her findings with a psychology professor at her univertsity - she calls the interesting phenomenon an overcompensation			1
' it can be that someone actually does harbour racist tendencies but does n't want to look racist to others so they overcompensate in that way , ' she says			0
she also says that it could stem from people who might think they have a bias but are trying to suppress it by being overly accommodating to people of other races or religions			0
' in general , just from my interactions , i think people honestly believe in equality and have those values but they just do n't know how to interact with minorities , ' she says			0
@entity12 , who is of @entity67 descent , was inspired by a similar experiment done in the @entity70 , where women were asked to wear a hijab for a day and watch how people treated them			1
' @entity98 ' : @entity12 found she was treated with more respect when she wore the hijab but it might be overcompensation by people battling with feelings of bigotry ' the desire came from wanting to understand better because there is so much tension around the idea of covering , ' she says			1
' i wanted to understand why women in @entity6 cover and also how it can actually be difficult in our culture to be covering			2
' ' there 's so many misconceptions and people think you 're oppressed and there are also issues of racism , that 's what prompted it , ' she continued			0
' people , culture and religion ar n't concepts you can understand on your own			0
rather it 's through dialogue that we generate understanding and respect between people , ' @entity12 concluded .			1
