@entity5 and her husband @entity6 had been engaged to be married two decades ago before @entity5 got cold feet and ended the engagement and the two lost touch for 20 years			1
four years ago they were to be reunited when @entity5 , looking for closure , wrote a letter to @entity13 they fell in love all over again and quickly married			1
but while the couple were delighted to be reunited , their road to happiness was not to be a smooth one			2
just four years after their emotional reunion , @entity5 endured a horrific road accident that left her with a severe head injury fighting for her life in intensive care			1
@entity5 and @entity6 were apart for 20 years after calling off their engagement , but reunited four years ago the tragic incident featured in last night 's episode of award - winning @entity32 documentary series 24 hours in @entity33			1
filmed at @entity36 in @entity37 following the accident , it was revealed that 47 - year - old @entity5 , who works as a secretary in an investment bank , was crossing a road 500 metres from her home in @entity37 when she was knocked down by a motorcyclist			1
the left side of @entity5 's face took the force of the impact , and she suffered a concussion as well as totally shattering her left eye socket			1
she fractured the lateral , medial , posterior and inferior wall of her left eye socket when the motorbike hit her			1
at the hospital she was found to have suffered a concussion from the impact to her head , and remained confused and disorientated during her treatment			0
as soon as @entity6 hears @entity5 has been injured , he rushes to hospital to be with her - but ironically gets stuck in the very traffic jam caused by @entity5 's accident			2
once there , he can be seen sitting diligently by his wife ’s side , holding her hand and comforting her in heart - warming scenes that sum up this extraordinary couple 's journey			0
@entity5 was hit by a motorbike while crossing the road , and @entity6 rushed to be by her bedside the left side of @entity5 's face took the force of the impact , and she suffered a concussion as well as totally shattering her left eye socket recalling their rocky road to romance @entity6 , who works as a driver for a fashion company , says : ‘ it was 20 - odd years ago , we started going out together			1
‘ we did n't work in the same office , but on the same floor			0
i 'm pretty certain it was almost love at first sight , sounds a bit corny , does n't it , but there was an instant attraction , that sort of warmth of her face and the glow that she seemed to give off			0
‘ and within a matter of weeks i 'd sort of proposed to her and said , " well , you know , why do n't we sort of make a go , you know , a proper go of things and get married ? " ’ despite agreeing to marry after such a brief romance , @entity5 , then aged just 21 , had second thoughts about the union as the wedding day drew near			2
@entity5 says : ‘ i met @entity6 when i was 21			2
he was just very , very good - looking and it was just wow , and we were engaged within two weeks			0
‘ three weeks before the wedding i turned around to him and said , " sorry , do n't want to marry you			0
" ‘ to @entity6 because i said those words , ' i do n't want to marry you ' , he just sort of switched off			2
' for me i thought he was just moving out to think and get himself together and that he was going to come back and then we 'd have a talk about it , but he never did			0
’ the couple had no contact for over 20 years after their split , and never discussed the end of the relationship			1
@entity6 says it was love at first sight when he first met @entity5 , and he asked her to marry him within a few weeks of dating then four years ago @entity5 decided to get back into contact with @entity126 ‘ i wrote to him and i said : " would you want to get in touch so we could just sort of have some closure ? because you just disappeared and there was no closure			1
for me it just was left hanging for over 20 years , " ’ @entity5 says			1
for @entity6 , in spite of the relationship 's hurtful end , the letter offered a chance to rekindle their special bond			0
‘ there was this letter in front of me from a person i 'd really loved and felt such a great bond with and yet , while things went wrong at the time , there were still those feelings there			0
@entity5 badly damaged her eye socket in the accident ‘ i actually sat on that letter for about a month thinking about things until i just got to the point where i thought well , what have i got to lose , ’ he says			1
after meeting up the couple decided to make the long - awaited wedding happen			0
@entity5 says : ' we finally made it down the aisle and it was very special second time round			0
' we were older , wiser and much more appreciative of things			0
' we got married in jeans and t - shirt with a friend of his from work and his mother , just two witnesses as it was our special moment			0
' with their love renewed , a besotted @entity6 hardly left @entity5 's side when she was in @entity176 's undergoing treatment for the horrific facial injuries she endured			2
and when @entity5 was finally well enough to leave @entity176 's , @entity6 was there to help his wife home			2
@entity5 is still recovering from her injuries and undergoing extensive physiotherapy but hopes to return to work soon			0
