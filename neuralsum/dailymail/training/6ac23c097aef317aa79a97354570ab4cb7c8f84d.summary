the age at which girls start their first menstrual cycle may impact their risk of heart disease , stroke and high blood pressure new research has found			1
women who begin menstruating before age 10 or after age 17 may have a higher risk of heart disease , stroke or high blood pressure than those who begin in the intervening years , according to a new study			1
@entity15 , the onset of first full menstrual cycle , tends to occur earlier in obese children , so the link between earlier periods and later heart disease risk was expected , said lead author dr. @entity22 of the @entity23 in the @entity24 women who begin menstruating before age 10 or after age 17 may have a higher risk of heart disease , stroke or high blood pressure than those who begin in the intervening years , according to a new study			1
researchers studied health data for more than one million @entity24 women ages 50 to 64 , including reproductive and medical history and national data on deaths and hospitalizations over the subsequent decade			1
over the course of about 11 years , almost 250,000 women were hospitalized for or died from complications of high blood pressure , 73,000 developed heart disease and more than 25,000 had suffered a stroke			1
those who had their first period at age 13 , about 25 percent of the group , had the lowest risk of heart problems during the study			1
but his team was surprised to find another increase in risk for older age at menarche , he told @entity56 by email			0
' @entity15 , onset of first full menstrual cycle , is a marker of puberty and the onset of endocrine functions relating to reproduction , but why the timing of menarche is associated with increased vascular disease risk remains unclear , ' @entity22 said			0
researchers studied health data for more than one million @entity24 women ages 50 to 64 , including reproductive and medical history and national data on deaths and hospitalizations over the subsequent decade			1
over the course of about 11 years , almost 250,000 women were hospitalized for or died from complications of high blood pressure , 73,000 developed heart disease and more than 25,000 had suffered a stroke			1
those who had their first period at age 13 , about 25 percent of the group , had the lowest risk of heart problems during the study			2
compared to those women , the four percent who reported having their first period at age 10 or younger were about 27 percent more likely to develop heart disease			2
heart disease risk increased almost as much for the one percent of women who started menstruating at age 17 or older , according to data in the journal @entity90			1
stroke and high blood pressure patterns were similar , but the increases in risk were smaller than for heart disease , the authors write			1
' this is a very interesting paper confirming previous association studies showing links between early menarche and cardiovascular disease risk , ' said @entity102 , a pediatric clinical scientist at the @entity103 in the @entity24 who was not involved in the new study			0
but previous studies have not included such a large group of women , he told @entity56 by email			0
those who had their first period at age 13 , about 25 percent of the group , had the lowest risk of heart problems during the study			2
compared to those women , the four percent who reported having their first period at age 10 or younger were about 27 percent more likely to develop heart disease			2
the risks remained even when the authors accounted for body size , smoking and socioeconomic status , @entity22 said			0
these findings are likely applicable to middle - aged @entity126 women born between 1930 and 1950 in industrialized countries , @entity22 said			0
the women in the current study were mostly white			0
researchers need to see whether the findings are similar in women of different ethnicities or from less industrialized countries , he added			0
heart disease risk was slightly different for women whose first period came at age 12 compared to those who started at age 15 , but so small as to likely be clinically unimportant , he said			2
' strategies to prevent excess weight gain during childhood may also avoid menarche occurring at an earlier age than necessary , which in turn could reduce the risk of developing heart disease and stroke in the long - term , ' @entity22 said			0
average age at menarche has been on the decline since the late 1800s , @entity22 noted			0
' what is currently unexplained is whether the timing of menarche per se is somehow what is crucial or is there another factor occurring / operating at around middle - age ( which might happen to be a correlate of age at menarche ) that increases susceptibility to the development of heart disease , ' @entity22 said .			0

women who begin menstruating before age 10 or after age 17 may have a higher risk of heart disease , stroke or high blood pressure than those who begin in the intervening years
researchers studied health data for more than a million @entity24 women
those who had their first period at age 13 had the lowest risk
