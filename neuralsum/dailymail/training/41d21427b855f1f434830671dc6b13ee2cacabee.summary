by @entity0 @entity1 should focus on a manned mission to @entity3 , and consider partneting with @entity4 on space missions , according to a new review of the human space flight program			1
the @entity9 report , commissioned by the @entity11 space agency @entity1 , recommends a stepping stone approach toward @entity3 that builds technological know - how through a series of well - defined preliminary missions			1
the space agency backed the report , saying ' there is a consensus that our horizon goal should be a human mission to @entity3			1
to get there she says there are a number of technological milestones that must be reached , including sending astronauts to an asteroid , to ensure the crew 's survival all options begin with the @entity35 , a $ 100 billion research complex flying 250 miles ( 400 km ) above @entity37 , the 286 - page report released in @entity39 , said			1
one path includes @entity1 's current plan to robotically capture an asteroid , redirect it into a high orbit around the moon and send astronauts there to explore			2
the report suggests that path continue with missions to the moons of @entity3 , then on to @entity3 orbit and finally to the surface of the planet			1
but two other paths would be less technologically daunting , @entity9 panel co-chairman @entity54 of @entity55 told reporters during a webcast press conference			0
@entity1 could follow the @entity35 program , which currently costs the @entity11 about $ 3 billion a year , with a series of lunar sorties , an outpost on the moon and then to @entity3 , the report said			1
the last path has the most stops en route to @entity3 , but poses the least technological risk since milestones have to be met along the way			1
that option would follow the space station with human missions to an orbit beyond the moon , then to an asteroid in its native orbit , then to the lunar surface , the moons of @entity3 , @entity3 orbit and then to @entity3 itself			1
@entity1 would find an asteroid which is between seven and 10m wide			2
they would then tow or push it towards @entity37 so that it ends up in a stable orbit near the moon			0
in 2021 astronauts would then use an @entity86 - a manned spacecraft - to land on the asteroid and bring back soil and rock samples for analysis			1
this asteroid would also , probably in the 2030s , be used as a stop - off point for astronauts on their way to @entity3			1
exact details on how @entity1 plans to pluck an asteroid out of its trajectory are not yet known , but the most recent rendering rendering shows it is captured and held inside what looks like a giant plastic bag			2
the mission involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next - generation @entity86			1
after the @entity86 and the asteroid are attached , the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object			2
once the @entity86 docks with the remote - operated asteroid capture device , the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from , the video shows			1
after the mission is complete , @entity86 returns to @entity37 on the same path it journeyed out on , loops around the moon included , and splashes down in an ocean – likely the @entity129 – 10 days later , as seen in the video			0
@entity1 said it supports the panel ’s findings			0
' there is a consensus that our horizon goal should be a human mission to @entity3 , ' the agency said in a statement			1
' the pathways thrust of the report complements @entity1 's ongoing approach			0
' all options will depend heavily on international , private sector and other partnerships , according to the report titled “ pathways to @entity148 and approaches for a @entity11 @entity150			0
” ' we ’re really talking about international collaboration of a different scale than what has been conducted in the past , ' @entity54 said			0
in particular , the @entity11 ’ current relationship with @entity4 , which is not a member of the 15 - nation space station partnership , needs to be reassessed , the report said			1
' given the rapid development of @entity4 ’s capabilities in space , it is in the best interests of the @entity11 to be open to its inclusion in future international partnerships			2
' @entity1 's @entity86 capsule will be one of the key components of any future attempt to land on @entity3			1
the capsule will be responsible for launching astronauts into space and ultimately returning them to @entity37			0
it is pictured here at the @entity175 at @entity1 's @entity176			0
its first flight will occur in december the panel gave no specific estimate of what a @entity3 mission would cost			1
but based on past space initiatives , the public would support the endeavor			0
' there is a temptation to rush to the question of dollars , ' panel co-chairman and former @entity187 gov. @entity186 said			0
' @entity191 is the secondary question			0
' the pathways approach to @entity3 is ' a very different way of doing business , ' @entity54 said			2
last week , nasa chief scientist dr @entity23 , in a series of talks across the @entity198 , outlined the plans of the agency to undertake such a mission in the next two decades			0
dr @entity23 , however , as keen to stress the importance of being cautious when undertaking what would arguably be makind ’s greatest accomplishment			0
other organisations such as the privately funded @entity207 have claimed they will land humans on @entity3 by 2025 , but have yet to reveal much research and development that indicates such a goal is achievable			2
@entity1 , meanwhile , is taking the careful approach			0
‘ we want to make sure we get living astronauts to the surface of @entity3 , ’ dr @entity23 said according to the @entity213			2
‘ for us , that is a non-negotiable position			0
there is a lot of work to do , that ’s why we need all of the space agencies around the world working together			0

these include landing on an asteroid and building necessary components for a 2035 mission
this will ensure the first @entity3 - walkers survive a return trip to the red planet
@entity4 could be involved in joint projects
