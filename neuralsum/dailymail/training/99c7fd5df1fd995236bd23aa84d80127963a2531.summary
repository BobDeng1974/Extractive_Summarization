the virus , called ' flame ' is the third major cyber weapon uncovered after the @entity4 virus that attacked @entity6 's nuclear program in 2010 , and its data - stealing cousin @entity8 , named after the @entity10 villain a computer virus described as a ' cyber weapon ' - the most complex ever created - has been discovered in thousands of computers in the @entity15			1
the virus , discovered by security experts @entity18 , marks a new era in cyber warfare			1
the virus , called ' flame ' is the third major cyber weapon uncovered after the @entity4 virus that attacked @entity6 's nuclear program in 2010 , and its data - stealing cousin @entity8 , named after the @entity10 villain			1
the virus is 100 times more complex than normal pc viruses , and designed to steal information - it can even turn on microphones on infected pcs to listen to conversations			1
all the viruses are so complex they are said to have required the resources of a nation state to create			1
many security experts - including @entity36 officials - have said that it was likely that @entity4 was made by the @entity36 but @entity22 is the most complex piece of malicious software discovered to date , said @entity18 security senior researcher @entity40 , whose company discovered the virus			1
the discovery by one of the world 's largest makers of anti-virus software will likely fuel speculation that nations have already secretly deployed other cyber weapons			2
' if @entity22 went on undiscovered for five years , the only logical conclusion is that there are other operations ongoing that we do n't know about , ' @entity40 said in an interview			0
the @entity57 - based company is controlled by @entity59 malware researcher @entity58 , and gained notoriety in cyber weapons research after solving several mysteries surrounding @entity4 and @entity8			2
researchers at @entity64 said they were only starting to understand how @entity22 works because it is so complex			0
the full significance will not be known until other cyber security firms obtain samples of @entity22			0
the @entity18 's research shows the largest number of infected machines are in @entity6 , followed by the @entity73 / @entity72 region , then @entity74 and @entity75			0
@entity6 president @entity76 , center , visits the @entity78 some 200 miles ( 322 kilometers ) south of the capital , @entity80 , @entity6 the virus contains about 20 times as much code as @entity4 , which attacked an @entity6 uranium enrichment facility , causing centrifuges to fail			2
it has about 100 times as much code as a typical virus designed to steal financial information , @entity18 said			1
flame can gather data files , remotely change settings on computers , turn on @entity93 microphones to record conversations , take screen shots and log instant messaging chats			1
he said there was evidence to suggest the code was commissioned by the same nation or nations that were behind @entity4 and @entity8 , which were built on a common platform			0
security experts have detected the malicious software by ' keys ' in @entity4 itself , which appear to be looking for other ' family members ' to communicate with			0
earlier this year , @entity64 labs said that @entity8 and @entity4 were part of a ' family ' of viruses created in the same place			0
@entity8 - a ' trojan horse ' program related to @entity4 which was detected in industrial systems earlier this year , also searches for @entity4 and @entity8 - infected machines			0
@entity8 is designed to steal information which could be used in cyber attacks on industrial control systems			2
it 's a ' scout ' program that could be used in preparation for a crippling cyber attack			2
both appear to be searching for three other ' relatives ' that have never yet been found .			0

third major cyber weapon after attack on nuclear plant
most complex virus ever found ' in the wild '
designed for *surveillance* - can even turn on @entity93 microphones to listen to *people*
not clear which country made flame - or what it does
100 times as complex as ' normal ' pc viruses
