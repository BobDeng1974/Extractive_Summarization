great players with baggage like @entity2 are always worth the aggro when they are on top of their game			1
but when their form dips and yet they remain high maintenance , there is only ever one outcome			0
it happened to @entity11 whose tantrums and outbursts were tolerated by sir @entity14 at @entity15 until the moment he no longer justified his place in the team			0
after the embarrassing mis - match in the @entity21 when @entity22 could have scored at least six against @entity23 , you feel that time is rapidly running out for @entity2 and others like @entity26 and @entity27			1
this summer will surely see a major transfusion of personnel at the @entity30 if they are to challenge @entity31 's best			0
midfielder @entity2 struggled to impress as @entity23 crashed out of the @entity32 to @entity22 city were happy to put up with the baggage that came with @entity2 ( right ) while he was performing at his best @entity23 captain and defender @entity26 ( right ) contests for the ball alongside @entity22 's @entity37 defender @entity38 has been left out of @entity23 's team for their biggest games this season @entity2 became the @entity42 's best - paid player when he signed for @entity43 from @entity22 in 2010			1
in domestic football , he has been an unqualified success and scored 24 goals last season as @entity23 won their second championship			1
his world - class strike against @entity50 at @entity51 won @entity52 the @entity53			1
when things were rosy , the club were happy to overlook constant talk about him being linked with other clubs , his pushiness to secure improved contracts and a farcical stand - off about not being treated with enough respect on his birthday			0
@entity42 managers felt the midfielder did n't do enough of the hard yards to protect @entity23 defensively but they were unable to capitalise much because when @entity2 had the ball he was an unstoppable force of nature			1
but those days have gone and the 31 - year - old 's hapless showing against @entity22 as @entity23 crashed out of the @entity32 underlined he is not the man to push the club forward any more			1
his dereliction of duty to allow @entity77 the space to score @entity22 's winner was noted immediately			2
going forward , his shooting was wayward and he was taken off before the end by @entity52 – unthinkable one or two years ago			2
remember , @entity2 had been banned for the previous three games in @entity31 and this was his big chance to show the world what he was still capable of			2
the club are in no hurry to offer the current @entity89 a new deal at anything like the £ 240,000 - a - week terms of his last contract			0
indeed , with @entity99 now increasingly important , the temptation to offload him and his wages to @entity97 this summer to allow new blood is very tempting			2
striker @entity27 could be considered as dispensable by @entity23 in the summer if they have an overhaul @entity101 ( right ) was in inspired form during @entity23 's 1 - 0 defeat to @entity22 on wednesday striker @entity104 ( left ) missed a penalty as @entity23 were eliminated 3 - 1 on aggregate by @entity22 city defender @entity107 ( left ) challenges @entity108 of @entity22 for possession of the ball @entity23 's failure to reach @entity31 's last eight under their @entity114 owners will create a major rethink at the club this summer			1
all their marquee names like @entity104 and @entity118 were signed before @entity52 's arrival in 2013			2
while their rivals are signing young , hungry , world - class players like @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 , @entity23 looked ageing and stilted in the @entity21			2
@entity2 symbolises the malaise but he 's not the only one			2
skipper @entity26 has been off the boil all season and can no longer lead while his personal form is so patchy			0
at 30 years old , @entity38 is still able to cope with run - of - the - mill league games but it 's interesting he has been left out of the really big matches like @entity132 away and @entity22 away			1
@entity27 is n't going to get any better , neither is @entity107 or @entity133			1
if they stay at @entity23 , they will only be squad players and in the case of @entity27 in particular his wages are astronomical compared with strikers at other clubs			1
the new signings from @entity141 have been flops			0
@entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 cost £ 72million and yet none of them are considered good enough to start			0
@entity148 , a young and skilful import from @entity149 , has fallen so far down the pecking order he was sacrificed from @entity23 's @entity32 squad , reduced as an @entity153 punishment			0
@entity133 ( centre ) is crowded out by @entity108 ( left ) and @entity77 of @entity22 @entity148 was removed from @entity23 's @entity32 squad to accommodate @entity145 @entity156 ( right ) chases after @entity108 in the @entity32 clash between @entity22 and @entity23 it is such a far cry from the excitement of the first few years under @entity160			1
he broke the @entity163 transfer record on his first day and while @entity164 did n't work out , it did create a buzz around the place			0
@entity104 , @entity118 and @entity2 were dazzling signings			0
city need to get back to that and go for the likes of @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 if they are going to threaten clubs like @entity22			0
it means a major clearout this summer and @entity2 could well be on the list .			0

@entity2 produced another *underwhelming* display against @entity22
the @entity23 midfielder has been linked with a move to @entity97
time could be up for @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity38
