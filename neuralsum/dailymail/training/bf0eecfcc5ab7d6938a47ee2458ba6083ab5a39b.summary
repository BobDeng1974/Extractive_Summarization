with a full head of ringlets , a dash of period - appropriate make - up and a darling hat , it has to be admitted that @entity6 makes an adorable young woman			1
indeed , the actor — strongly tipped for an @entity9 next year for his performance as physicist @entity11 in @entity12 — spent much of his teens in female roles			1
he explains that as a pupil at all - boys ’ school @entity17 , it was necessary for some boys to take the female roles in drama productions			1
and it is no surprise to learn that @entity6 — full - lipped , with high cheekbones , delicate features and a stardust sprinkling of freckles — was often chosen to trip prettily across the gender divide			2
indeed , one national newspaper critic who reviewed the production gushed that @entity6 was ‘ scandalously persuasive as @entity31 ’ in this all - male production and ‘ would bring out the bisexual in any man ’			2
equally floridly , the play ’s director , @entity42 , observed that the young actor was ‘ quite troublingly beautiful ’			1
as luck would have it , this cross-dressing performance was @entity6 ’s big break			2
having excelled at drama at @entity17 — where he was a contemporary of prince @entity51 and regarded him as a ‘ mate ’ — he went on to @entity53 , @entity54 , on a choral scholarship			1
@entity6 pictured playing @entity31 in an all - male production of @entity33 ’s @entity32			1
the director described him as ' quite troublingly beautiful ' two years into his history of art degree , he was contacted by his @entity17 drama master and asked to audition for the role of @entity31 in a production at @entity64 ’s @entity63			1
aged only 20 , he got the part and starred opposite the brilliant @entity66 — managing to counter the established actor ’s scene - stealing tendencies with a performance of remarkable freshness and intelligence			1
there was an immediate bidding war between various @entity64 agents who were keen to sign @entity6			0
leading theatre and film roles followed , notably in the film musical of @entity79 and @entity80 ( about @entity82 ’s troubled relationship with @entity83 ) , plus a stint as one of the faces of fashion label @entity87			0
@entity6 and @entity89 were introduced by one of his siblings and are reported to have wed in a secret ceremony on monday now , at 32 , he is hot property on an international scale , and on the verge of a-list status			1
he is also — to general heartbreak — just married to his long - term girlfriend , @entity89 , an antiques dealer			1
on monday , the couple tied the knot at @entity101 , a private members ’ club in @entity104			1
they are rumoured to have had the venue turned into a ‘ winter wonderland ’ with fake snow			0
it is certainly an eventful time for @entity6			0
last week , he was nominated as best actor in the @entity112 — a sure - fire indication that he will be in the running for an @entity9 in february			1
@entity6 has been linked to various high profile celebrities such as @entity115 but the @entity79 actor married antiques dealer @entity89 this week the critics are drooling over him — with his performance as a young @entity11 described as ‘ mesmerising ’ ( @entity12 is set for release here on @entity121 )			1
so , what makes @entity124 such movie gold dust ? born in 1982 , one of five sporty , academic and accomplished children , @entity6 was raised in considerable privilege			0
home was a magnificent pile overlooking the @entity130 on @entity64 ’s @entity131			0
although his parents were not in @entity133 ( his father is a successful banker ) , he had drama lessons and , aged 12 , played an urchin in a @entity138 production of @entity139 ! he wanted to go to drama school , but his parents persuaded him to go to university first			2
to his credit , he has never tried to play down his moneyed roots , nor has he been the target of much of the criticism of ‘ over-privilege ’ that has been directed at fellow posh boy actor @entity147			2
unlike fellow actor @entity147 , @entity6 has never been the target of criticism regarding his privileged upbringing ‘ do i feel posh ? well , i suppose , ’ @entity6 once said			2
‘ i went to @entity17			1
i also went to @entity54			1
so , yes , i definitely come from a privileged background			0
but i have lots of friends from different walks of life			0
’ and explaining why there seems to be a disproportionate number of actors from upper - crust backgrounds ( @entity160 , who plays @entity162 in the @entity164 films , @entity166 ’s @entity165 and @entity168 ’s @entity167 are also @entity169 ) , @entity6 has pointed to fee - paying schools ’ superior facilities			0
an inspirational drama teacher was also a huge influence			2
@entity174 , known as ‘ @entity175 ’ to the boys , chose @entity6 for a leading role in his first school production — a version of @entity181 ’s @entity180			0
next , he played @entity182			0
@entity6 ( left ) with @entity183 ( centre ) and @entity174 ( right ) , started in the acting business aged 12 , playing an urchin in a @entity138 production of @entity139 ! @entity174 recalled : ‘ i knew as soon as i met [ @entity6 ] that he was exceptionally gifted			0
he was able and happy to be very raw			0
that remains part of the essence of why he ’s such an extraordinary actor			2
’ after school , and that key turn as @entity31 , the roles and praise kept on coming			0
@entity198 , former artistic director of the @entity199 , @entity64 , says : ‘ @entity6 finds an honesty and purity in the moment			0
’ @entity6 played a psychotic schoolboy in the thriller film @entity204 , then @entity206 ’s son in @entity207 , followed by a role as @entity210 ’s incestuous son in @entity211			0
the actor 's latest film @entity12 is due for release on @entity121 and sees him taking on the role of a young @entity11 as for his personal life , in 2011 he was linked to actress @entity115 ( now married to @entity217 of folk - rock band @entity218 )			1
the following year , he was spotted cosying up to pop star @entity220 , after she went backstage having watched him perform			0
but he denied any relationship , saying : ‘ i spoke to her for seven - and - a - half minutes			0
’ in truth , he was dating @entity89 , a brunette with a taste for @entity226 frocks , who is believed to have been introduced to @entity6 by one of his siblings			1
the couple announced their engagement in june , with @entity6 telling @entity233 how he had very romantically attempted to measure @entity89 ’s finger for a ring by waiting until she was asleep			1
the marriage plans were kept very quiet , but according to sources , the couple became man and wife in a candlelit ceremony at 5.30pm on monday			2
but his female fans can comfort themselves that , though he ’s now married , they will be seeing an awful lot more of him on the big screen in years to come .			0

the actor is strongly tipped for an @entity9 for his performance as @entity11
photos of him in @entity32 show his good looks at a young age
he tied the knot with @entity89 at @entity101 on monday
having excelled at drama at @entity17 he went on to @entity53 , @entity54
