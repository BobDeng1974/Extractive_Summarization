opposition : @entity1 said a new marriage law for gay couples would amount to forcing unwanted change on the rest of the nation the law has no right to legalise same - sex marriage , the archbishop of @entity8 declared yesterday			1
dr @entity1 said a new marriage law for gay couples would amount to forcing unwanted change on the rest of the nation			1
he also said it would be wrong to legalise assisted dying because of the threat it would pose to the vulnerable and because it would go against the beliefs of most people			1
in a key speech on human rights , the head of the @entity22 put his weight behind other leading clergy who have launched a powerful campaign to prevent @entity28 from going ahead with his plan to allow the full rights of marriage to same - sex couples			0
dr @entity1 ’s predecessor in @entity35 , @entity36 , notably told the @entity37 last week that same - sex marriage laws would be ‘ one of the greatest political power grabs in history ’			1
dr @entity1 ’s statement means the prime minister now knows he will face opposition from the liberal - minded leadership of the @entity46 – as well as its determined traditionalists – if he continues on the track towards legalised gay marriage			1
the archbishop said human rights law ‘ falls short of a legal charter to promote change in institutions ’			2
dr @entity1 added : ‘ if it is said that a failure to legalise assisted suicide – or same - sex marriage – perpetuates stigma or marginalisation for some people , the reply must be , i believe , that issues like stigma and marginalisation have to be addressed at the level of culture rather than law			1
’ @entity68 : @entity28 declared that he was in favour of same sex marriages last autumn the archbishop indicated to mps earlier this week that @entity46 churches would never be used to solemnise gay marriages and @entity22 officials underlined that the @entity22 says marriage must remain a union between a man and a woman			1
dr @entity1 ’s intervention in the argument yesterday , in a speech to a @entity84 gathering in @entity85 , echoed , in typically mild academic language , the sentiments expressed by @entity36			2
the archbishop has long been a personal supporter of gay rights and his lecture yesterday insisted @entity90 must accept that gay equality laws are here to stay			2
but he has also listened to the concerns of traditional @entity94 believers since he began his career at @entity35 in 2003 by refusing to allow an openly gay cleric to take a post as a @entity46 bishop			2
his remarks yesterday came after @entity101 ministers insisted they would go ahead with a same - sex marriage law whatever the churches say			2
equality minister @entity104 said last week the churches did not own marriage law			0
she added a same - sex marriage law would be ‘ about the underlying principles of family , society and personal freedoms ’			0
mr @entity28 declared for same - sex marriage last autumn , saying : ‘ conservatives believe in the ties that bind us ; that society is stronger when we make vows to each other and support each other			0
‘ i do n’t support gay marriage in spite of being a conservative			0
i support gay marriage because i am a conservative			0
’ a consultation document on how a gay marriage law would work is due out shortly			0
dr @entity1 said in his speech that same - sex marriage law was wrong because it tried to impose cultural change			1
he added human rights language could be ‘ confused and artificial ’ when it strayed from protecting the vulnerable			0
it could become ‘ an alien culture , pressing the imperatives of universal equality over all local custom and affinity ’ .			0

archbishop also says wrong to legalise assisted dying because of threat to the vulnerable
