the @entity2 leader said : ‘ we have never suggested since 2004 that anybody who has come here legally and in good faith should be subject to retrospective legislation ... that would be unfair , un-british and wrong			2
‘ let me make this clear , during our divorce negotiations , even if the @entity5 was to behave badly , and was to say , people living in @entity62 would be threatened with not being there , we would maintain the line that we believe in the rule of law , we believe in @entity6 justice , we believe anybody who has come to @entity6 legally has the right to remain			2

miss @entity123 said : ‘ it ’s a two - horse race and the reality of it is if we do n’t want to wake up to a @entity2 mp on friday 21st november then people who would normally be voting for @entity22 , the @entity127 or anyone else , then they need to be voting for me			2

@entity12 , who defected from the @entity28 in september , said he had been contacted by two former colleagues during his campaign to win the @entity15 and @entity16 seat today			1

it is a very individual decision			0
and i feed back to @entity0 on those conversations			0
‘ a lot of conservative mps will be looking at the result closely			0
i think it ’s about @entity2 being able to show we are taking votes from @entity22 as well as the @entity106			0
