he also said he believed he knew those who held the murdered aid worker and had helped secure the release of hostages from extremists in @entity20 in the past			2
' my understanding is that @entity1 did make some appeals , sadly , as we know , those appeals fell on deaf ears			1
' if @entity1 has information to provide about who these people are , he should provide it			2
' the prime minister defended the way the government had handled the is hostage situation , following criticism from mr @entity11 's family that they had been prevented from speaking out about his capture			1
' the approach that we take , when these terrible things happen , is to work with the family , to try and find the hostages , but not to raise the media profile of an individual case because it can put that person at even greater risk			0
former @entity2 detainee @entity1 walked free from jail on wednesday after a string of terrorist charges linked to the civil war in @entity20 were dramatically dropped			1
mr @entity1 ( pictured ) has claimed to know who was responsible for holding mr @entity11 captive when asked how he felt about being released from the high security @entity23 after seven months in custody , he told waiting reporters : ' i wanted my day in court but i was very happy			1

@entity11 ( pictured ) was delivering aid to @entity20 refugees last year when he was kidnapped and some of his symptoms had re-emerged since he has been in custody at @entity23 , his lawyer @entity85 said : ' theoretically the longer he is in custody the worse there are likely to become			2
' the 45 - year - old appeared before the @entity68 via video link from high security @entity23 when mr @entity93 formally acquitted him of all charges			2
at an earlier hearing he had pleaded not guilty to all the charges			0
but at a pre-trial review lasting just five minutes the prosecution dramatically dropped the case			0
prosecutor @entity99 said : ' the prosecution in every criminal case of every type have a duty to keep under review the sufficiency of the evidence			0
' when mr @entity1 was charged with a number of offences earlier this year the @entity107 were satisfied there was sufficient evidence to afford prosecution			1
