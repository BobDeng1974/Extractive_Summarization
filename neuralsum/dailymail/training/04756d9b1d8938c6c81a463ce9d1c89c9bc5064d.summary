@entity12 died from bleeding of the stomach lining , which was probably caused by a milk intolerance independent expert dr @entity28 , a paediatric surgeon said the procedure would have found the bleeding and @entity12 could have had a life - saving operation to remove part of his stomach			1
he told the @entity35 inquest : ' what was a complete failure was the lack of collaboration between surgeons and gastro - enterologists			0
closer teamwork would have resulted in a different outcome			0
' @entity12 's distraught mother @entity44 , 38 , broke down and sobbed as she told the hearing : ' i believed they would cure him and make him well			2
' the young boy had had three endoscopies at the hospital in the previous fortnight after vomiting blood and suffering stomach pain but was thought well enough to be discharged on friday , july 9 , 2010			1
consultant paediatric gastro - enterologist dr @entity54 , who was in overall charge of @entity12 although off duty that weekend , said he left instructions to be called if the boy had a serious bleed again			1
mrs @entity60 , who also has two daughters aged seven months and seven , left with her son but during the night he vomited blood again			0
' he cried and i felt he was in pain , ' she said			0
' his body was cool and exhausted			0
' @entity12 's parents @entity67 ( left ) and @entity68 , moved from @entity69 to @entity70 after the tragic loss of their son @entity12 was rushed by ambulance to @entity74 and several hours later was transferred to the @entity17 unit on the afternoon of saturday , july 10			1
mrs @entity60 said after doctors checked her son she noticed his nappy was ' full of blood ' which she was worried about and claimed the wet bed covers had to be changed at least five times by nurses			0
' a nurse told me it was a good sign as the blood was coming through his faeces and not the mouth , ' she said			0
@entity12 should have had an endocopy as soon as he was readmitted to hospital on the saturday afternoon			1
instead he was monitored as his condition worsened , an inquest heard			0
he died the next day mrs @entity60 was then told by staff that dr @entity54 would perform another endoscopy on @entity12 at 8am on the sunday morning			1
but in the middle of the night she noticed his stomach was distended and ' swollen like a bubble			0
' a doctor thought it might simply be a build - up of gas but at 4am @entity12 vomited blood again			2
the mother said ' all the doctors were in panic and confused ' by 6.30am at which time dr @entity54 arrived			1
' i was really pleased , i believed he was going to save my son , ' mrs @entity60 said			0
but despite a blood transfusion , @entity12 failed to respond and he died at 9am on the sunday			2
paediatric registrar dr @entity110 , whose job was to stabilise the boy , told the @entity35 inquest she had not been informed of any " red button plan " to alert dr @entity54 and a surgical team if there was a further bleed			1
when she first saw @entity12 he was sat up in bed watching @entity119 on a monitor with his mother and appeared stable			2
she was only called by a nurse at 4.30am when he vomited blood again			2
she instructed he be given more fluid as he had low blood pressure and a raised pulse , called for closer monitoring and ordered some units of blood which should have been ready but were not so fresh ones had to be made up			2
dr @entity110 said she alerted both the surgical and medical registrars to the situation and was told dr @entity54 would be coming in as planned to carry out an endoscopy at 8am			1
when coroner @entity134 pointed out that dr @entity54 had asked to be made aware if there was any further bleeding she replied : ' there was no red button plan delivered to me			1
' dr @entity141 , for the family , put it to dr @entity110 : ' knowing that this is a significant bleed , you did n't make any contact with anyone anywhere until 6.15am			1
' she replied : ' i assessed and i managed and then i contacted my superiors			0
' @entity12 died at @entity17 ( pictured )			2
a lack of teamwork between surgeons and gastro - enterologists was partly to blame , an inquest heard specialist paediatric registrar dr @entity155 said he arranged for dr @entity54 to do the endoscopy on sunday morning and there was no contingency plan in place			1
he said : ' i do n't recall him saying he had to be called back in the event of further bleeding			2
' he himself was not told of any further fresh bleeding which could have been a ' serious finding			0
' mrs @entity60 and her petrol station cashier husband @entity68 , 42 , ran a grocery store in @entity69 at the time but after the tragedy moved to live with relatives in @entity168 , @entity70			0
they came to the @entity170 12 years ago and are @entity170 nationals			0
dr @entity28 who reviewed the case said @entity12 had a ' mighty strange illness ' for a child and he had not come across such a case of catastrophic upper gastro - intestinal bleeding in a child before			1
he said the @entity17 was unique in that @entity12 was admitted to the care of paediatricians rather than surgeons			0
the boy should have had an endoscopy on the saturday which was an " error of judgment " by the doctors caring for him			0
' the benefits of identifying the cause of the bleeding far outweigh the potential risks , ' he said			0
' i would say dr @entity54 was taking a risk			1
' the inquest was adjourned .			0
