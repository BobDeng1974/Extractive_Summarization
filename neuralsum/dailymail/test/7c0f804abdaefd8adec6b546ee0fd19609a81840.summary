it 's been a frustrating few weeks but at our end we are trying everything we can to make the fight that everyone in this country wants to see – @entity7 against @entity8			1
you 'll have seen by now that we have offered @entity10 £ 1.5million for the fight – all he has to do is turn up , we will take all the risks			1
if there 's more we can do to make this fight happen then i do n't know what it is			2
now it is up to @entity8 and his people to decide if they really want it			2
if they do , cash the cheque and come to the @entity25 on july 18			1
@entity7 is desperate to fight @entity8 and has offered him £ 1.5million to do so on july 18 promoter @entity26 produced a cheque for £ 1.5m live on television on tuesday i hope they do because i really ca n't understand what is stopping them			1
all the risk is on our side			0
i have fronted up this money and @entity7 is the one who might earn less			2
if this only generates average pay - per - view numbers then he might only make a third of what @entity8 is getting			1
personally , i think it will do big numbers and then @entity7 will probably get about the same as @entity8			1
it was interesting to see the @entity44 ( @entity8 's promoters ) statement shortly after			2
they said this fight can only happen if they are co-promoters			0
why , if we are the ones putting the money up ? if it matters that much to them to have their name on the poster or @entity55 read their name out before the fight then i do n't have a problem with that either			0
the fact is it 's not about @entity44 or @entity62 , it 's about @entity7 and @entity8			1
@entity8 made the first defence of his world title against @entity65 in february in any case , @entity7 will fight on july 18 at @entity25			1
i have held talks with both @entity68 , the @entity70 sensation , and @entity71			1
both are former world champions and both are brilliant fights			0
@entity7 has options but he knows the biggest fight in the super-bantamweight division is a unification against @entity8			1
that is why we are busting a gut to make it happen			0
now the ball is in @entity8 's court			2
it is looking very likely at the moment that @entity88 will fight on my may 30 card at the @entity91			1
with @entity93 and @entity94 fighting for world titles and @entity96 taking on @entity97 , the addition of @entity88 will make this one of the very best cards this country has seen in years			1
many have called for a fight between the @entity103 's @entity102 ranked fighter @entity104 to face @entity88			1
i can tell you it is a fight that we are considering very closely			0
@entity88 looks set to make a quick return to the ring with an appearance on may 30 at the @entity91 it 's been an interesting few months for @entity104			1
in november he won the @entity114 and @entity115 titles against @entity116 and now his options look like a fight for the @entity103 international title against @entity120 , an @entity103 title eliminator against @entity122 , or a straight fight against the holder , who happens to be @entity88			1
as his promoter , i ca n't see the merit in him going to @entity128 to fight @entity122 if @entity88 is an option on may 30			1
and believe me , it is an option we are looking at closely			0
@entity104 could challenge @entity88 for his world title in @entity133 in an all - @entity114 showdown the public , more than anything , like an all - @entity114 fight			1
and every 10 minutes since we signed @entity104 he has been asking for a fight with @entity88			1
as @entity88 says , it is nice to see a @entity114 fighter with the balls to fight him			2
@entity143 is in action in @entity145 this weekend			0
the unbeaten @entity145 featherweight is up against @entity147 for the vacant @entity149 international title and it is his first real step towards a world title			0
this kid is brilliant inside and out of the ring			0
one of the highlights of my job has been watching him and @entity94 moving towards each other			0
if @entity94 wins the world title against @entity159 on may 30 , as i believe he will , then the stage will be set for a huge world title fight between @entity94 and @entity162 in 2016			2
@entity143 bids to continue his rise when he takes on @entity147 in @entity145 on saturday @entity96 marches on			2
he destroyed @entity164 on saturday , making it 11 fights , 11 wins and 11 knockouts			0
considering he has endured a lengthy lay - off with a stress fracture in his back , i could not have been happier			0
people have questioned the opponent but @entity164 is a guy who went four rounds with @entity175 in his 32nd fight last year			0
that is not to make a comparison with @entity96 and @entity175 , but more to show that in beating @entity164 in three rounds there should not be any doubts about what was a worrying injury			2
@entity96 made it 11 stoppage wins from as many fights when he beat @entity164 in @entity186 @entity96 is likely to fight in @entity187 on may 9 before taking on @entity97 three weeks later we will now carry on full speed with a guy who i am convinced will soon be a world champion			1
i am looking to get him out again on may 9 in @entity187 and should have more information on that soon			2
then he will face @entity97 at the @entity91 on may 30 and from there we are looking at the likes of @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200			0
beyond that you have @entity203 and @entity204			0
i 'd expect those fights to be ticked off in the next 12 months			0
people want to see him fight the best now			0
but this is a process and we have a plan			0
the huge fights are coming up and i 'd back him to look absolutely devastating .			0

@entity7 and i have taken all the risks - @entity8 must step up
we **'ve** written him a cheque for £ 1.5million so what is stopping them ?
i **'ve** also held talks with @entity71 and @entity68 for july 18
@entity88 vs @entity104 under strong consideration for may 30
@entity96 will probably fight again on may 9 in @entity187
