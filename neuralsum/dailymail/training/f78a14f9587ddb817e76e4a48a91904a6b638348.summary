by @entity0 published : 10:23 est , 27 july 2012 updated : 10:23 est , 27 july 2012 the @entity1 is set to introduce a treaty cracking down on the $ 60billion global business of illicit trading in small arms			1
the move is aimed at curbing violence in some of the most troubled corners of the world , but has unsurprisingly ruffled feathers with pro-gun activists in the @entity12 , including those of the @entity14			2
they have denounced the treaty as a threat to their constitutional right to bear arms			0
controversial topic : pro-gun campaigners say the treaty as a threat to their constitutional right to bear arms ( file picture ) ' without apology , the @entity14 wants no part of any treaty that infringes on the precious right of lawful @entity12 to keep and bear arms , ' @entity14 executive vice president @entity26 told the @entity1 this month			1
' any treaty that includes civilian firearms ownership in its scope will be met with the @entity14 's greatest force of opposition			1
' fellow critic @entity37 , who was president @entity38 's ambassador to the @entity1 , wrote that gun - control advocates ' hope to use restrictions on international gun sales to control gun sales at home			1
' but what both sides ignore is a well - enshrined legal principle that says no treaty can override the @entity49 or @entity12 laws , according to the @entity51			2
campaign issue : @entity53 , left , has suggested stiffer gun regulations while @entity55 , right , yesterday said he did not think the laws should change in fact , a first draft of the treaty circulated in @entity59 this week has been criticised by arms - control activists for containing too many loopholes			1
for instance , it does not include a proposed ban on ammunition trade			0
gun activists are standing firm in near - blanket opposition to such a ban , as last friday 's deadly @entity71 , @entity72 , theater shooting rampage heightens interest in the deliberations and raises the stakes			0
@entity53 supports the treaty effort but has not talked about it on the presidential campaign trail			1
equally , presumptive @entity81 candidate @entity55 has not addressed the issue but broadly opposes what he sees as overreach by the @entity1 on many fronts			1
he told a town hall in @entity87 last week that he was ' not willing to give the @entity1 sovereignty in any way or form ' over @entity12 citizens or law			2
this week , they clashed long - distance when mr @entity53 suggested stiffer gun regulations in a speech to the @entity96 and mr @entity55 argued in an @entity98 interview from @entity99 , where he is traveling , that @entity12 does not need new gun laws			1
the @entity49 's @entity102 offers broad protection for weapons ownership by civilians			0
as recently as 2008 , the @entity106 affirmed this when it struck down a ban on handguns in the @entity110 , ruling that individuals have a constitutional right to keep guns for self - defence and other purposes			0
the rule that treaty obligations may not infringe on individual constitutional protections and rights goes back at least to a 1920 ruling that a migratory bird treaty with @entity122 , which prohibited the hunting or capturing of certain birds , was an unconstitutional interference with states ' rights under the 10th amendment			2
treaties are government - to - government agreements and do not subject citizens of one nation to laws of another or to those of an outside body			0
the @entity1 resolution that authorised the drafting of the small arms treaty recognises the right of nations ' to regulate internal transfers of arms ' and says nothing in the treaty that emerges will affect ' constitutional protections on private ownership ' of firearms			1
there are many other court rulings spelling out the limits of treaties			0
if an act of @entity154 is inconsistent with a treaty obligation , the law passed by @entity154 prevails , which has led to various international treaties with @entity158 tribes being quashed			0
a proposed treaty to regulate exports and imports of small weapons has been on the @entity1 agenda since 2006 , when mr @entity38 ordered a veto			1
mr @entity53 got the process rolling again in 2010			2
so far , 152 nations have participated in the drafting and secretary of state @entity168 has pledged to push for @entity170 ratification once there is a final document			0
but it may be an empty gesture			0
treaties must be ratified by two - thirds of the 100 - member @entity170 , or 67 votes			0
with pressure mounting from the gun lobby , led by the politically powerful @entity14 , a letter opposing such a treaty has already gained the signatures of well over 50 senators			1
even so , fears have spread online lately , with some pro-gun activists even suggesting the @entity53 administration was capitalising on the @entity72 killings to advance its case for gun control and others portraying it as a plot by the @entity1 to expand its reach			1
the controversy fuels suggestions by many conservatives that mr @entity53 ultimately hopes to ban possession of firearms , even though he has stood up for protecting @entity102 rights			1
some gun - rights advocates acknowledge that a treaty by itself would not be likely to undercut these @entity102 guarantees			2
' but there are all kinds of ways that international law insinuates itself into @entity12 law even when there 's not a formal ratification , ' said @entity209 , research director for the conservative @entity210 , based in @entity72			0
for instance , he suggests a treaty could affect the shipment of certain gun parts to @entity12 manufacturers			0
but @entity216 , international legal director of @entity217 , said : ' there is no doubt that the @entity49 is superior to any international treaties			0

the @entity14 say the treaty is an infringement of their rights
@entity53 has suggested stiffer gun laws
@entity55 is against the changes
issue has been on @entity1 agenda since 2006 , when @entity38 ordered a veto
