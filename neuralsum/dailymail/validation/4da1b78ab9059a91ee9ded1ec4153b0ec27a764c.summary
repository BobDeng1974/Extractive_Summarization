@entity0 and his girlfriend will be giving a whole new meaning to the term ' long - distance relationship ' when he sets off for a 12 - month trip to the @entity6 on saturday			1
' for me it 's like the most romantic long - distance relationship ever , ' the @entity9 astronaut 's girlfriend of five years , @entity7 , told @entity13			1
@entity0 , who has spent a total of six months away from @entity7 on previous trips to space , will be able to call her whenever he likes and will be able to video chat once a week			1
' we get to connect on phone calls			0
we get to have our face conference			0
but you ca n't upload human touch			1
' @entity7 , 41 , works in @entity9 's public affairs department in @entity42 , @entity43 ; she has been with the agency since 1998			1
last year the fitness fanatic tried out to become a @entity47 cheerleader , but failed to make the squad			0
@entity0 , 51 , who has two young daughters from a previous relationship , said he will miss food on @entity26 as well as ' the rain , the breeze , the change of seasons '			1
but ' most of my concerns with this flight , being gone for a year , is the stuff that can happen to people on @entity26 while i 'm gone , ' he told @entity61			2
still , the couple say they are more excited about @entity0 's return home and what his record - breaking trip will achieve			1
' we kind of really appreciate challenge and things that are hard , because we often know at the end of it , that you can kind of go , " yeah , we did that , " you know ? ' @entity7 said			2
' and the homecoming 's really good after a year , ' @entity0 quipped			1
left behind : speaking from their @entity78 , @entity43 home , the couple agreed they would miss human touch during the 12 months apart but were already looking forward to the homecoming family : @entity0 said he also worries about being away from his two daughters from a previous marriage @entity0 , together with @entity87 @entity86 and @entity88 , will launch from @entity89 in @entity90 in the early hours of saturday			1
the trip will test how the human body copes with prolonged space travel by comparing @entity0 's health to that of his identical twin brother , retired astronaut @entity96 , who will remain on @entity26			1
called the @entity98 , the @entity97 will be subjected to 10 experiments in four areas : human physiology , behavioral health , microbiology and molecular			2
' maybe there is a little cliff out there that you fall off with regards to the radiation , bone mass , bone density , those type of things , so , i am all in , ' @entity96 told @entity13			0
still , @entity96 , who is married to former congresswoman @entity116 , says he has no intentions of consuming bland space - type food or working out and running two hours a day on a treadmill , as his brother will be doing in space			1
' this is a chance in a lifetime , ’ said dr @entity124 , the deputy chief scientist of @entity98 's @entity125			0
giant leaps : @entity0 , pictured right , will undergo tests to compare his health to that of his identical twin brother , @entity96 , left , himself a retired astronaut , to see how being in space affects the body close : @entity96 , pictured left as he joked around with his brother after a news conference in the @entity89 , @entity90 on thursday , said he would not be eating the same diet as his twin ' in this case we 've got two genetically identical individuals and we can monitor what kind of changes occur in @entity96 in an ordinary lifestyle and compare those to the changes that we see in @entity0			1
' by staying on the station for 12 months , the astronauts will also provide key information on how an eventual @entity147 mission - estimated to last three years there and back - might play out			2
a mission to the red planet will require long periods of time in reduced - gravity environments , both in space and on the surface of the red planet			2
but , until now , crew members have only spent about six months on the @entity157 at a time			0
@entity0 and @entity86 will spend 12 months in space , while @entity88 will be there for just six months			1
they will travel there on the @entity163 spaceshuttle			0
@entity86 , 54 , a former paratrooper from @entity164 , will also leave a wife , @entity165 , on @entity26			1
his 32 - year - old daughter is a new mother			1
team : @entity0 is pictured with @entity87 cosmonauts @entity88 ( center ) and @entity86 ( right ) , who will travel with him			1
only he and @entity86 will remain on the space station for 12 months @entity171 digs : @entity0 , 51 , sits inside a @entity163 simulator at a training center earlier this month the @entity175 spacecraft is seen on its launch pad at the @entity89 cosmodrome ahead of its mission getting ready : an @entity179 priest blesses the @entity163 rocket at the @entity89 on thursday his wife cried when she learned in 2012 that he 'd be leaving @entity26 for a whole year			1
and she 's still not happy about it , @entity86 previously told the @entity183 ' she understands that it 's a dangerous mission			2
but she 's getting used to the idea , ' he said			0
on his trip , @entity88 will break the record for cumulative time spent in space , which currently stands at 803 days , and will also become the first person to command the station four times			0
the three will join expedition 43 commander @entity194 of @entity98 and his crewmates , @entity196 of @entity197 and @entity198 of @entity199			0
see below for video @entity0 this will be the fourth spaceflight for mr @entity0 , 51 , a former @entity98 shuttle commander and @entity204 test pilot whose identical twin brother , @entity96 , also was chosen as an astronaut in 1996			1
the two will conduct many of the same medical experiments over the coming year so scientists can compare the results			0
@entity0 's first two flights were aboard shuttles			2
he spent more than five months on the space station in 2010 to 2011			0
it was during that mission that his sister - in - law , then congresswoman @entity116 , nearly died after being shot in the head in @entity218 , @entity219			0
once he 's back home in @entity78 , @entity0 imagines it will be ' hard to walk away ' from spaceflight			2
he 'd love to pilot one of the new @entity225 spacecraft in development			0
but he figures if he cuts in front of other astronauts awaiting assignments , ' someone will run me over with their car			0
' what will @entity0 miss the most , besides his loved ones ? the weather			2
' it never changes on the space station , ' he said			0
' even though it 's a pretty nice environment , i guess it 's like living in @entity243 , people get sick of it ... after a while			0
' @entity86 it will be the second space mission for mr @entity86 , 54 , a former paratrooper whose helicopter - pilot father was part of the search and rescue team for the first @entity251 cosmonauts back in the 1960s			1
his father brought back souvenirs from the returning @entity163 capsules : uneaten food rations and pieces of the orange silky parachutes used for the final descent			0
' @entity260 made gorgeous skirts out of them , ' he said			0
' i still have a small piece of one of those parachutes			0
' i cherish it as if it were something sacred			0
' a religious man , mr @entity86 is taking into orbit a folding icon depicting the @entity271			0
his previous station stay was in 2010 , 12 years after his selection as a cosmonaut			2
he figures he 'll miss the same things he dreamed about last time he flew : water not in the form of blobs as in space , but water you can swim in , as well as grass , forests and fields			1
mr @entity86 already says he 'd take on another one - year mission — after a break , of course .			1

@entity0 will leave @entity26 on saturday for a 12 - month trip to the @entity6 with @entity87 cosmonaut @entity86
he will undergo tests to compare his health to that of his twin brother , retired astronaut @entity96 , to see the effects of space on the body
but he will be leaving behind his girlfriend of five years , 41 - year - old @entity7 , who works in @entity9 's public affairs department
they said they 'll miss human touch but know the mission is for the greater good - and said they are already looking forward to the homecoming
