an independent @entity1 would be defended by a part - time air force , military analysts said yesterday			2
they suggested that the limited defence spending that would follow independence means the new country would be forced to run an air force that could operate only in office hours			1
@entity8 , defence consultant at @entity9 ’s , said a @entity1 air force is likely to run on similar lines to those of @entity13 or @entity14			1
file image the @entity13 air force has aircraft ready to fly during office hours on weekdays only , because spending limits and shortage of pilots and personnel means it can not fly around the clock			2
@entity14 has 12 modern @entity17 fighters – the same number @entity1 would claim from the rest of the @entity33 after a @entity20 vote – and operates them between 8am and 4pm			0
lack of air defence capacity in @entity1 would force @entity38 aircraft to intervene in the event of an out - of - hours emergency , for example the arrival in @entity1 airspace of a hijacked airliner			1
the @entity1 government has said it plans to spend £ 2.5billion a year on defence			0
it would claim two frigates and four minehunters from the @entity50 , together with the @entity51 to be handed over by the @entity38			2
after a decade of independence , it plans to have a standing army of 15,000			0
mr @entity8 said : ‘ there is a danger of a limited @entity1 defence budget resulting in what can be considered a very hollow force			0
‘ such limitations on military capabilities are precisely why the @entity62 is likely to view independence as further fragmentation of @entity66 defence capabilities			0
’ lack of air defence would force @entity38 aircraft to intervene in the event of an out - of - hours emergency			1

limited spending would mean air force could only run in office hours
it is likely to run on similar lines to those of @entity13 or @entity79
would force @entity38 to intervene in event of out - of - hours emergency
