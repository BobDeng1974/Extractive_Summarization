an islamic state terror attack on soldiers in their barracks in @entity3 is believed to be so likely , ' it 's not a question of if , but when ' , a security specialist warned today			1
threat expert @entity7 said that reports of up to three @entity10 terror cells planning attacks on troops were ' highly likely ' , adding : ' i think three is probably a conservative figure '			2
and he said that a second threat was the high likelihood of a ' lone wolf ' terror attack here , similar to those that killed two soldiers in @entity23 this week			1
' unlike the @entity29 - style " big spectaculars " such as 9/11 , 7/7 , and the @entity31 bombings , the threat from @entity10 is a much more low - level , under the radar , visceral type of terrorism , often involving just one or two lone wolves operating alone , ' he told @entity34			1
an attack on soldiers in @entity3 is so likely , ' it 's not a question of if but when ' , a terror expert said today , in the wake of the murder of corporal @entity42 , 24 , left , by @entity43 convert @entity44 , 26 , in @entity23 mr @entity7 said the spontaneity of ' lone wolf ' terrorists , who could buy a knife and attack people in a landmark location such as @entity52 , pictured , made them difficult for counter-terror agencies to detect in advance threat expert @entity7 , right spoke out as @entity56 ordered a review of security at @entity3 landmarks mr @entity7 , of security and counter terrorism firm @entity62 , spoke after @entity64 sources reportedly said they had discovered @entity10 terror cells carrying out surveillance on four barracks across the country			1
the worrying intelligence suggested an attack on @entity3 troops and their families - similar to the murder of soldier @entity74 in may last year - might be imminent			2
mr @entity7 said : ' sadly it 's not a question of if , but when			0
i certainly think we will see something			0
' his warning coincided with recent arrests of terror suspects			0
last week four @entity3 men were charged with terror offences after allegedly carrying out ' hostile reconnaissance ' of @entity88 's @entity87 and @entity90 @entity89 in west @entity91 using @entity93 street view			0
as well as the threat from terror cells involving several terrorists working together , @entity3 security agencies are concerned about the increasing risk from radicalised individuals fusilier @entity74 , 25 , was murdered outside @entity100 in south east @entity91 last may mr @entity7 said such attacks might be planned by two types of @entity104 extremists - those who wanted to join @entity10 in @entity106 but were unable to , like @entity107 gunman @entity44 , 26 , whose passport had been confiscated by authorities , and those who had been over there but had returned to home turf with the desire to carry out an attack there			1
the security expert said : ' the lone wolf attack by just one or two people is the biggest concern to @entity3 security agencies , particularly the spontaneity of such attacks			1
' you can go into @entity122 , buy knives , and be out on @entity52 attacking people within an hour , which makes such attacks very difficult to predict			0
' the degree of violence that is potentially being deployed by these extremists is of especial concern - they are wanting to execute someone - behead them - in the street , and the fact that these days people tend to whip out their phones and record things means the impact of such an attack would be huge			0
' he said the best weapon against such an attack was the vigilance of members of the public , and urged people to report any suspicious behaviour immediately			0
security agencies are said to be ' working all hours ' fighting the terror threat on home soil , witnessed by the high rise in the number of recent terror arrests			1
military personnel and police officers , particularly those who wear uniform in the street , have been warned to be alert to the dangers , and prime minister @entity56 has spoken to the heads of @entity159 and @entity160 to review security at landmark buidings in @entity3			1
his talks with @entity159 boss @entity164 and @entity166 police chief sir @entity165 came in the wake of wednesday 's fatal attack by @entity43 convert @entity44 on corporal @entity42 , 24 , as he guarded the @entity169 in central @entity107			2
the gunman then stormed the parliament building before being shot dead by former @entity172 , sergeant - at - arms @entity173 , 58			0
authorities are reviewing security at landmarks in @entity3 including the @entity178 and @entity179 extremists @entity181 , 29 , left , and @entity182 , 22 , drove @entity74 down before murdering him			2

threat specialist says extremist attack on soldiers in @entity3 is ' highly likely '
he says reports of three such plots by terrorists are ' probably conservative '
