the first weekend of the @entity5 is done and dusted and , largely true to form , the usual suspects of @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 already occupy the top four spots			1
and with the opening games come debuts , and plenty of them , as every club in the top flight featured at least one summer acquisition in their starting line - up			1
but how did did they all get on ? here , @entity16 ranks the top 10 who impressed on their first @entity5 appearances for their new clubs ... 10 @entity21 team : @entity23 cost : free his @entity23 debut ended in defeat against @entity3			1
but his performance at the @entity28 made for encouraging viewing for @entity23 fans			2
not only his goal , but the way he handled @entity3 's lively attacking unit bodes well for @entity23 's attempts to stay in the @entity5			1
big man : @entity21 was an imposing presence in the heart of @entity23 's defence against @entity3 9 @entity39 team : @entity41 cost : £ 8m foxes boss @entity42 has decided to put his faith in the @entity45 striker - a man who has no @entity5 experience - in @entity41 's top - flight return			1
his capture has raised a few eyebrows but what better way to answer your critics than a debut goal			2
and the striker did just that , scoring his new side 's first goal of the season in the draw against @entity59			0
could be a snip at £ 8m			0
@entity61 : @entity39 celebrates scoring on his @entity41 and @entity5 debut against @entity59 8 @entity63 team : @entity65 cost : £ 2.85m perhaps the player with the lowest profile on this list , but if he puts in more performances like his one against @entity69 on saturday then that wo n't last long			1
the young @entity73 was playing for @entity74 two years ago , on saturday he was lining up against @entity75			0
and the occasion did n't get to the left - wing back one little bit			0
understated : @entity63 ( right ) had an impressive debut during @entity65 's win at @entity69 on saturday 7 @entity81 team : @entity2 cost : £ 12m not the most explosive of debuts but he was extremely effective in the @entity5 champions ' win over @entity87 on sunday			1
he showed a great understanding of the game , sniffing out danger in front of his back - four			0
@entity93 has been on @entity81 's case since the back end of last year , on sunday we caught a glimpse of why			1
power player : @entity81 was a force in midfield for @entity2 as they outplayed @entity87 6 @entity101 team : @entity103 cost : £ 10.9m the @entity104 is essentially @entity106 's replacement at @entity107 's and maybe , just maybe , the @entity103 will not miss the @entity109 midfielder as much as they thought they might			1
he also looks to have the x-factor , too - his back heel to set up @entity115 's goal against @entity4 was one of the highlights of the weekend			2
nice tough : @entity101 showed glimpses of being the player who could replace @entity106 at @entity103 5 @entity121 team : @entity3 cost : £ 16m the 19 - year - old looked like he 'd been a @entity5 centre - back for 10 years against @entity23 on saturday			1
composed , comfortable on the ball and strong in the tackle , the teenager has all the hallmarks of an @entity109 regular in the making			0
the fact he broke through at @entity103 as right - back makes his rapid transition inside even more impressive			0
composed : @entity121 started at the heart of @entity3 's defence against @entity23 4 @entity136 team : @entity1 cost : £ 32m when you cost as much as @entity136 does then you have no option but to hit the ground running			1
and the @entity142 international showed exactly why @entity143 splashed so much on him by scoring on his debut			0
there 'll be tougher opponents for @entity136 this season , but he 's already off to a flier			2
impact : @entity136 may prove to be the missing link in @entity1 's attack this season following his arrival 3 @entity153 team : @entity1 cost : £ 30m @entity3 and @entity156 supporters look away now			1
yes , it is just one game			0
yes , it 's against @entity160 ( no disrespect ! ) but @entity153 was sensational at @entity162			2
he knows exactly what the @entity5 is all about so there 'll be no problems with him adapting			2
remains one of the world 's best centre - midfielders despite his struggles at @entity171			0
class touch : @entity153 assisted two goals on his return to the @entity5 against @entity160 2 @entity175 team : @entity177 cost : £ 4m perhaps not the most glamorous of summer signings but he is already a fans favourite amongst the @entity181 faithful following his injury time winner against arch - rivals @entity184			1
his versatility will be huge asset for @entity177 this season			0
looks a shrewd signing by @entity189			0
announcement : @entity175 scored a last - gaps winner for @entity177 as they beat @entity184 on saturday 1 @entity192 team : @entity194 cost : undisclosed okay , he 's played for @entity194 before , but what a way to re-announce yourself to the club 's fans			1
it does n't get much better than scoring on your ( second ) debut , but not only that , scoring the winner at @entity205 in @entity207 's first game in charge			0
@entity210 boss @entity209 was desperate to bring the @entity212 midfielder back to the club , it 's not hard to see why			0
return : @entity192 scored the winner at @entity205 in his first game back for @entity194			2
