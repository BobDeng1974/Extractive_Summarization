by @entity1 reporter last updated at 8:04 pm on 22nd september 2011 @entity2 has said a six - ton satellite doomed to fall to @entity4 this week will not hit the @entity5 as incredible video was captured showing the start of the spacecraft 's descent			1
scientists today said that the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) will make its final fiery plunge on friday afternoon when it is not due to be passing over @entity14			1
@entity5 had been warned that the 20 - year - old bus sized satellite could cause injuries and damage to property as it falls through the atmosphere and drops about two dozen pieces of debris on to @entity4 weighting up to 300lbs			1
a @entity2 spokesman said : 're - entry is expected sometime during the afternoon of sept 23 , @entity39			1
' the satellite will not be passing over @entity14 during that time period			2
' it is still too early to predict the time and location of re-entry with any more certainty , but predictions will become more refined in the next 24 to 36 hours			2
# the predictions came as a astrophotographer in northern @entity48 captured video of the satellite			2
@entity27 's clip shows the spacecraft appearing as a beaming mass of light as it plummets to @entity4			1
best guess : the satellite could fall anywhere between the two latitudes , where billions of people live mr @entity27 's footage of @entity11 was captured through the lens of his @entity63 14in @entity62 in @entity64 , @entity48 on september 15 - eight to nine days before its estimated re-entry			2
filmed at an altitude of only 250km , the body of the @entity11 is visible , as are its solar arrays			2
mr @entity27 told the skywatching website @entity72 : ' the satellite appears to be tumbling , perhaps because a collision with satellite debris a few years ago			2
the variations in brightness are rapid and easily visible to the human eye			0
' the @entity11 , or @entity11 , ran out of fuel in 2005			0
@entity2 says it will point between 57 degrees north and 57 degrees south			1
most of the satellite will burn up during re-entry , but a 1,200 pounds of metal metal will still plummet to the @entity4 ’s surface			1
@entity85 : @entity27 captured the incredible footage in @entity64 , @entity48 on his @entity63 14in @entity62 telescope astronomer dr @entity88 , from the @entity31 @entity89 , says the @entity4 's atmosphere slows down falling satellites a great deal			1
he explained that what remains of @entity11 will hit the ground relatively slowly and ' certainly not at orbital velocity of 17,500mph '			2
much of any satellite crashing to @entity4 will be disintegrated by heat , caused by friction with the atmosphere			1
it 's the reason we get shooting stars - created by meteors burning up in the upper atmosphere			0
@entity11 is large enough , though , that up over a ton will strike the ground			0
it will not be in one piece , however : space vehicles experience incredible stress on re-entry			0
the load can be as much as @entity112			0
an @entity114 car experiences around @entity115 with maximum braking from high speed			0
the reason why the location of the crash site is so hard to predict is because the density of the atmosphere varies so greatly higher up , producing different amounts of drag			0
a prediction that was wrong by even a few minutes would mean the satellite landing a huge distance away , owing to its speed			0
it ’s being tracked by the @entity130 of @entity131 at @entity132 in @entity133			0
a @entity2 spokesman pointed out that there has yet to be any reported injury from falling space debris			1
he said : ‘ the risk to public safety or property is extremely small , and safety is @entity2 's top priority			1
since the beginning of the @entity145 in the late - 1950s , there have been no confirmed reports of an injury resulting from re-entering space objects			0
this satellite is far smaller than the 135 - ton @entity152 space station @entity153 , which fell to @entity4 in 2001 or the 100 - ton @entity154 that fell in 1979			1
so far this year alone , two large @entity152 rocket stages have fallen to earth without inflicting any injury			0
@entity153 fell into the @entity158 , while @entity154 hit the @entity159 and parts of sparsely populated western @entity161			2
because two - thirds of the @entity4 is ocean , space debris usually hits water			1
@entity2 is urging anyone who finds a piece of the @entity11 satellite not to touch it			1
the spokesman added : ‘ if you find something you think may be a piece of @entity11 , do not touch it			0
contact a local law enforcement official for assistance			0
’ it was launched back in 1991 by the @entity176 to measure ozone levels , wind speeds and temperatures in the stratosphere			0
junk yard in space : @entity11 is one of the thousands of objects in @entity4 orbit being tracked by @entity2 , as shown by this computer graphic but now it ’s one of 370,000 pieces of junk floating in space at speeds of up to 22,000mph			1
the volume of debris was greatly increased by a 2007 @entity196 anti-satellite weapon test and a 2009 crash - in - orbit of two satellites			0
the widely criticised @entity196 test used a missile to smash an ageing weather satellite into 150,000 pieces of 1cm debris and 3,118 pieces can be tracked by radar on the ground			2
the @entity11 is something of a relic - these days , @entity2 satellites are designed to be light enough to burn up on re-entry , or to have fuel to fly up into a higher , longer - term orbit			1

@entity2 predicts it will re-enter some time on friday afternoon ( @entity5 time )
around *26* pieces will hit the @entity4 , in pieces weighing up to 300 pounds
