@entity0 believes @entity1 is the ' perfect ' person to help @entity2 cope with the pressure of defending his @entity5 title			1
@entity2 took the tennis world by surprise by appointing @entity1 , a former @entity8 and @entity5 champion , as his coach after the @entity10			1
initially the deal is only for the grass - court season but both are hoping it will extend beyond that			1
all smiles : @entity0 believes @entity1 ( left ) is the perfect person to help @entity2 ( right ) the partnership did not get off to the best start with @entity2 's third - round loss to @entity19 at @entity20 , but their focus from the start will have been @entity5			1
after ending @entity26 's 77 - year wait for a men 's singles winner 12 months ago , all eyes will be on the world number five when he steps out to begin his defence on monday			2
@entity0 is well - placed to judge @entity1 's capabilities because it was the 34 - year - old to whom @entity0 turned last year for help at @entity5			1
frustrated figure : @entity2 lost to @entity19 in the third round at @entity20 with @entity1 in her corner , @entity0 went on to become one of the most surprising champions in @entity5 's long history			1
she said : ' if @entity2 's looking for someone who can help him deal with the pressure of defending the title and coming back again to @entity5 then he hired the perfect person , because @entity1 's really someone that is able to take all the stress away and make you feel extremely comfortable			1
' i really felt that way when she was coaching me as my @entity50 captain or as my adviser during @entity5			2
she was able to give me some small but great advice in order to deal with my stress			0
' she prepares you for the worst and gives you some advice in order to deal with that , so when you start to face that situation you are ready			0
' i really felt she was a tremendous help to me last year , especially in the final and semi-final			0
' @entity0 expects @entity2 and @entity1 to hit it off on a personal level as well , saying : ' they 're both extremely funny , i think they will joke around a lot			1
' @entity1 's been in every situation , she 's been a player , a coach , on the bench as a @entity50 captain			2
she knows really well what she 's speaking about			0
' nation expects : @entity2 goes into this year 's @entity5 as defending champion having won it last year while @entity2 was warming up for his @entity5 defence at @entity75 on thursday , @entity0 was stepping out for a public match for the first time since her shock retirement last august			1
the unlikely venue was @entity80 , with @entity0 accepting an invitation to play in the @entity82			2
football played a big part in @entity0 's decision to accept the invitation			1
the 29 - year - old is a huge fan and is hoping to return later in the year to watch a match at @entity89 or @entity90			0
eyes on the prize : @entity0 beat @entity93 to win the women 's singles final at @entity5 last year ' @entity82 , soccer , tennis , grass - that 's a great combination , ' she said			1
' if you tell me , clay court , @entity10 , maybe it would be more tricky			0
but grass , @entity104 , @entity82 , that works pretty well			0
@entity5 's right around the corner , there 's going to be some amazing memories , it 's just a great time			2
' @entity0 has insisted since laying down her racquet little over a month after winning @entity5 that she has never had any regrets			2
she has done some media work but her main post-retirement activity has been launching a fashion business			0
warm embrace : @entity0 ( right ) hugs her then coach @entity118 ( left ) after her @entity5 triumph @entity0 is currently working on a line of tennis bags , and she said : ' i feel extremely lucky that i 've been able to realise my dream as a tennis player but i do n't like to call myself a retired person , it 's just like i 've finished the first part of my life and now i 'm starting the second part , which is as a fashion designer and creator			1
' this is something i really love to do , i want to explore that and i 'm working really hard , just like i did on the tennis court			0
' i feel like i 'm 1,000 in the rankings and i need to become a @entity5 champion			0
it 's a long way to go			0
it took me 22 years to fulfil my dream in tennis , i truly hope it wo n't take me that time in fashion			0
