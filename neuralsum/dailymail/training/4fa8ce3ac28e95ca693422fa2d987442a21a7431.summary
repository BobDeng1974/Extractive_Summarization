by @entity0 published : 02:44 est , 25 may 2012 updated : 04:25 est , 29 may 2012 a second possible new @entity3 case of rabies is being investigated after a man sought hospital treatment for a dog bite he received on holiday , experts confirmed today			1
the @entity9 said a second person was being tested for the disease , two days after it confirmed a case of the potentially fatal illness in a 50 - year - old woman who had been bitten by a dog in @entity16			1
the woman , believed to be a grandmother in her 50s , was reportedly turned away twice by doctors at @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23 , before she was finally diagnosed			1
the hospital has launched an investigation			2
investigation : five members of staff at @entity21 have been vaccinated after coming into contact with the woman the new patient , a male from @entity32 , sought medical attention after being bitten while abroad , although the @entity9 would not say where he had been or provide any further details about his identity			1
a spokesperson said : ' there is another person being looked at			0
' this is n't unusual that people bitten by dogs in rabies endemic areas go for further investigation when they return			1
' there are eight people this year who have been through this process			0
' rabies is usually transferred through saliva from the bite of an infected animal , with dogs being the most common transmitter of rabies to humans			1
more than 55,000 people are estimated to die from the disease every year , with most cases occurring in developing countries , particularly @entity16 and @entity61			0
specialist treatment : the patient is in an isolation room at @entity65 , @entity66 ( above ) after developing symptoms within the last fortnight the woman with rabies is now being treated at @entity66 's @entity70 , which has reassured patients , visitors and staff there is no risk to them as a result of the case			1
yesterday it was reported she had initially been sent home three times after going to a gp and @entity82 complaining of sickness			0
each time she was sent home because doctors believed her symptoms were ‘ vague ’			2
now hospital staff claim the diagnosis was hampered because she failed to mention her trip or the dog bite			2
had she done so ‘ alarm bells would have rung immediately ’ , staff said			0
deadly : the grandmother 's illness is the first case of rabies in @entity97 in almost seven years			1
the last occurred in july 2005 when a woman died after contracting it from a dog bite during a holiday in the @entity103 resort of @entity104 , pictured rare : naturalist @entity106 ( pictured ) became the first person in @entity3 to die of the disease for 100 years after he was bitten on the hand by a rabid bat in 2002 the victim , who lives in @entity66 , is being treated in an isolation unit at the @entity70 at @entity65 , @entity66			1
the @entity9 has insisted members of the public are not at risk			0
twenty people who have been in contact with the patient , including relatives , a gp and hospital staff have been offered vaccines as a precaution			1

she returned the next day but the hospital refused to admit her believing she was suffering from a mild illness			2
killer : rabies viruses showing their characteristic bullet shape			2
the disease has an extremely low survival rate once symptoms have developed vaccination programme : although all but eradicated in the @entity3 rabies is still common in developing countries a source at the hospital said : ‘ had the staff been properly informed about this woman ’s trip to @entity103 , and especially that she had been bitten by a dog there , alarm bells would have rung immediately and the whole approach to her treatment would have been totally different to what happened			1
’ it was only when she visited her gp again last friday – four days after the first appointment – rabies was suspected			0
hospital staff have admitted she is unlikely to survive			1
but even if she had been diagnosed sooner it is unlikely her chances of recovery would have been any higher			0
once the symptoms of rabies develop – including sickness , aggression and hallucinations – the virus has spread to the brain and is nearly always fatal			0
professor @entity166 , of the @entity167 and @entity168 at the @entity169 , said the mortality rate is ‘ almost 100 per cent ’			0
‘ almost everyone who gets bitten but does n’t seek help will die within a few weeks of the symptoms starting to show , ’ he said			0
although no one has caught rabies in this country since the early 1900s , several have become infected while travelling abroad			2
the last case in @entity97 was in 2005 when a @entity180 woman died after contracting the virus from a dog bite in @entity104 , @entity103			1
