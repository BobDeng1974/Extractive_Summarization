@entity0 rarely shirks a tackle			1
just ask @entity2 or @entity3 or @entity0 ’s doctor			1
he knows only one way , it is in his nature and that is not about to change , even if his stomach lurched and he feared for his @entity11 dream when he picked up his phone in march and saw messages backing up from the medical experts			2
the injury had not seemed too serious at the time			1
there was no great pain , he played on for 40 minutes and there was nothing alarming on the post-match scans , but there was a threat of deja vu in the air			2
video : scroll down for @entity0 takes on pinball machine in latest @entity29 advert back in action : @entity31 midfielder @entity0 ( left ) controls the ball during training on wednesday taking a tumble : @entity0 gets brought down by a tackle from team - mate @entity36 in the frame : @entity0 could start saturday 's @entity39 final with @entity40 after returning to full training legend : @entity0 thinks @entity2 is the greatest @entity43 midfielder of all time three years ago , @entity0 hobbled out of @entity45 after an @entity47 game with a sore ankle and did not play another competitive match for 17 months			1
this time , he feared a place in @entity47 ’s @entity11 squad might be in jeopardy when a closer inspection found a crunching challenge with @entity3 during an international friendly against @entity56 had caused a hairline fracture in his left foot			1
‘ the tackle was probably 70 - 30 in his favour , but i still went into it , ’ said @entity0			1
i ca n’t change that because it ’s a big part of my game			2
the manager at @entity31 has always said to me it ’s important not to lose that bite			1
‘ when i first did it , i thought , “ @entity71 ” , but then as i walked off it felt easier and i carried on			2
after the game , i had a scan straight away and it did n’t show anything			2
i had to go to someone who specialises in reading scans to see it			0
‘ next day , i woke up and had about six missed calls from the doctor , so i went to see the specialist who looked after my right ankle and he said it would take six weeks			0
‘ it took a few days to get my head round it			0
i ’ve been in that position before , so i know what it takes — a lot of work in the gym , on the bike , to keep up fitness levels			0
’ @entity0 returned as a sub at @entity97 on sunday in @entity31 ’s final game of the @entity100 season			1
he is now in contention for saturday ’s @entity39 final against @entity40 and made the cut for @entity105 ’s 23 - man @entity47 @entity11 squad			1
ouch : @entity0 broke a bone in his foot in this challenge with @entity56 's @entity3 in march he 's back : @entity0 returned from injury in @entity31 's 2 - 0 win at @entity97 on sunday if anyone deserves a break , it is the 22 - year - old midfielder earmarked by former @entity47 boss @entity114 and international skipper @entity115 as a future captain of his country			1
‘ there ’s a few ahead of me , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ there ’s @entity121 and @entity122			0
they ’re where i want to be			0
they ’ve got experience and won all those caps			0
people say this is @entity115 ’s last @entity11 , am i going to be @entity47 ’s next captain ? no , i ’m not			1
‘ first , i ’d like to be captain of my club			0
the most important thing for me is to get those caps , have a full season without any injuries and just prove myself			0
’ without question , injuries have slowed @entity0			1
he has won 15 @entity47 caps since @entity114 handed him a debut four years ago but progress has been so painful at times that some have wondered if the young midfielder will ever be the player he promised to be as a teenager			1
@entity143 bound : @entity31 boss @entity144 believes @entity0 will be match fit for the @entity11 @entity2 touched this issue while working as a tv pundit for the @entity149 derby			1
the former @entity47 midfielder said @entity0 had not improved in five years — a harsh assessment which stunned the @entity31 player			1
‘ it was out of the blue , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he was having a go at @entity31 , and i was wondering if he was going to come for me			1
if it had come from a rubbish player i could say , “ what are you talking about ? ” but it came from @entity2			2
for me , he ’s the best @entity43 midfielder of all time			1
’ just as he proved unable to resist the tackle with @entity3 , he went after @entity2			2
‘ go easy on him , ’ said @entity47 coach @entity164 as he passed @entity165 a phone number for his former @entity168 team - mate			1
@entity170 words : @entity0 had a discussion with @entity2 ( centre ) after the former midfielder criticised him getting stuck in : @entity0 says his injury problems wo n't affect his physical style on the pitch honest : @entity2 did n't hold back when discussing @entity0 's progress at @entity31 during a tv appearance ‘ i wanted to get to the bottom of it , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i just wanted to hear what he thinks			0
i respect him so much			0
we had quite a good chat			0
he ’s entitled to his opinion			0
he explained it a bit better and told me what i should work on			0
‘ he was right in a certain way			0
i ca n’t keep saying i ’ve been injured a lot			0
there comes a time when you stop being a kid and i think that ’s what he ’s referring to			2
this season i ’ve improved a lot , scored a few more ; got a few more assists			0
‘ it ’s those stats that matter			0
that ’s what i have to build on			0
’ the other angle of that @entity2 critique was aimed at the lack of leadership in @entity144 ’s @entity31			1
again , it is a moot point for @entity0 as the @entity39 final approaches and @entity31 seek to end nine years without a trophy			1
relaxed : @entity0 ( centre ) shares a joke with team - mate @entity211 ( left ) in training ‘ i ’m young but i ’ve been around the first team for a while , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ i ’d like to think of myself as a leader and i like to think the manager thinks of me as a leader			0
‘ we ’ve been here before in the @entity219 ( losing 2 - 1 to @entity221 in the 2011 final )			2
no disrespect to the @entity219 , but this is bigger			0
‘ you remember the @entity39 finals			2
it ’s right that we go on and win this			0
we do n’t have to prove we have leaders to win this			0
we just have to win it			0

@entity0 called @entity2 after the former @entity168 midfielder criticised his progress
@entity31 star describes @entity2 as ' the best @entity43 midfielder of all time '
@entity0 could start @entity31 's @entity39 final against @entity40 after returning from injury against @entity97 last week
the @entity47 man *insists* that his injury problems wo n't affect how he plays the game
