of all the statistics from the recent @entity4 in @entity5 - 1 million revelers , 2,000 pounds of confetti , thousands of police officers , dozens of surveillance cameras - there is one number that stands out : zero , as in zero tickets for low - level crimes			1
no tickets for having an open container of alcohol , no tickets for public urination , no tickets for double parking , no tickets for furry , costumed characters hassling tourists to take their picture			1
add in low - level arrests , and there was just one , for a subway - related offense			1
and that was n't just on @entity4			1
that was for the entire week containing the holiday			0
during the @entity34 week , when the neon - lit streets were every bit as jammed , the total for such infractions was 23 - compared to more than 650 summonses per week the previous year , according to police statistics			2
they were particularly incensed by comments in which the mayor warned his biracial son to be wary in dealing with officers			0
in the two weeks after two @entity69 officers were shot to death in their patrol car december 20 by a fugitive who had ranted online about avenging police killings , low - level arrests citywide dropped 61 per cent			1
summonses were down more than 90 percent			0
arraignment courts have been so slow they have sometimes closed early , and @entity77 's jails have about 2,000 fewer inmates			0
' they have n't been on top of us like they used to , ' @entity79 said on a recent night in @entity5 , where he roams the streets in a @entity86 costume posing for photos in hopes of tips			0
' they 're minding their own business now			0
' on friday , police commissioner @entity92 said he 'd concluded that some officers had purposefully cut down on small - time arrests and tickets - and that enough was enough			1
free to celebrate : revelers celebrate after midnight during @entity4 festivities at @entity5 in @entity54 none of whom were penalized for low level crimes such as public intoxication or urination ' we 'll work to bring things back to normal , ' he said , adding that the numbers were already rising			1
no officers are being disciplined , with @entity92 noting ' the extraordinarily stressful situations ' in a month filled with protests , police funerals and discord			2
the latest figures will be available monday			0
police unions say there was no sanctioned work slowdown , and they are quick to point out that officers are still rising to the call of duty			2
just this past week , two police officers were shot and wounded responding to a report of a robbery moments before their shifts ended			1
' our members are doing their job , ' said @entity125 , head of the @entity126 , which represents 24,000 officers			0
the 14 - block precinct in the heart of @entity5 was among at least seven across the city where not a single summons was issued for parking , moving or criminal violations during @entity134 's week - a statistic that makes some people nervous			0
' it 's dangerous for the public to know that the police are doing less , ' said @entity140 , 57 , who teaches knitting at a senior center in @entity144 's @entity143 , one of the zero - summons precincts			2
' it might make criminals more eager to do crime			0
' bringing in the @entity134 : police commissioner @entity92 ( @entity150 ) with members of the @entity69 in @entity5 on @entity4 decrease : in the two weeks after two @entity69 officers were shot to death in their patrol car december 20 by a fugitive who had ranted online about avenging police killings , low - level arrests citywide dropped 61 per cent to @entity161 veteran @entity160 , police are n't in a position to back off on doing any part of their jobs , whatever the reason			1
' their orders are to protect and serve , ' @entity160 said as she went to a medical appointment in another precinct with zero tickets on @entity173 's @entity172			0
' you do your job , or you get out of that occupation			0
' the slowdown has overshadowed an overall , years - long decrease in every measurable crime statistic : complaints of crime , arrests and summonses			1
crime of all kinds decreased 4 percent to all - time low in 2014 , when there were 332 homicides , down from 335 the previous year			2
the slowdown in enforcement has n't translated to a rise in crime			1
in the past two weeks , reports of serious crimes were down to 3,704 from 4,130 in the same period a year earlier			1
that has critics questioning @entity92 ' signature crime - fighting tactic : the " broken windows " theory that targeting low - level infractions discourages more serious crime			1
some police reform advocates say the slowdown proves that the city can do without a tactic they see as heavy - handed			2
' there have been unnecessary arrests , and this proves it , ' said @entity209 of @entity210			0
but @entity92 says the arrests are no less necessary , despite the let - up			2
' the whole thesis of ` broken windows ' is : if over time you do n't address an issue , over time it will create a larger issue , ' he said .			0

this @entity4 in @entity54 there were no tickets for having an open container of alcohol among other low level crimes
low - level arrests citywide dropped 61 per cent after two police officers were shot *execution* style inside a cop car
the slowdown in enforcement has n't translated to a rise in crime and reports of serious crimes were down to 3,704 from 4,130 recently
