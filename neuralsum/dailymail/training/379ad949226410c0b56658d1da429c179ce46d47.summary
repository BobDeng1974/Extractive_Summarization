by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 00:41 est , 22 november 2012 updated : 11:21 est , 22 november 2012 entire new towns and cities must be built across the country to tackle @entity7 ’s housing crises , @entity2 said today			1
the deputy prime minister said it was time to ‘ rediscover that proud tradition of creating new places ’			1
in a speech to the @entity13 , mr @entity2 warned that without a dramatic increase in house building home ownership would remain a ‘ pipe dream ’ for a generation of young people			1
@entity2 warned babyboomers of the fifties and sixties are now watching their children struggle to buy a home the government is making £ 225 million available funding to ' unblock ' a series of major local housing projects which have ' hit a wall '			1
together , the schemes - which range in size from 4,000 units to 9,500 - will provide up to 48,600 new homes			1
but mr @entity2 said the shortage of homes is becoming so acute , there will in future need to be even more ambitious , with new developments of 15,000 to 25,000 homes			1
he said housebuilders should draw inspiration from the garden cities of early 20th century , such as @entity43 and @entity44 , and the new towns of the post-war era like @entity47 and @entity48			1
‘ we can either condemn ourselves to haphazard urban sprawl – the surest way to damage the countryside , ’ he said			2
‘ we can cram ever more people into existing settlements , concreting over gardens and parks – and bear in mind we already build the smallest homes in @entity60			2
‘ or we can build places people want to live			2
places which draw on the best of @entity7 architecture and design , which have their own identity and character			1
‘ which , rather than destroy the countryside , actually have a crucial role in keeping it intact			2
‘ places put together in a way that makes sense for modern @entity7 families			2
’ leafy : @entity2 wants to ' unblock ' a series of major local housing projects to emulate success of @entity43 in @entity78 ( pictured ) mr @entity2 announced the @entity79 will be injecting £ 400m into the @entity7 affordable housing sector to help build new energy efficient affordable homes			1
he said that the shortage of homes for young people has created a ' generational shift ' in the debate , with people becoming more receptive to the idea of new developments which in the past would have been strongly resisted			0
' the babyboomers of the fifties and sixties , people who were largely catered for by the massive housing expansion after the @entity97 , are now watching their children struggle			0
' he went on : ' the plight of the next generation is making what was an abstract housing shortage increasingly tangible and real			0
and as we , as a society , become more open to development that creates the space for politicians to be bold			0
' mr @entity2 warned @entity7 is already building 100,000 fewer houses than is needed every year			0
over the next decade , each year , the @entity7 is going to grow by around 230,000 households , he said			0
‘ last year we managed to complete 117,000 – just over half			0
‘ unless we take radical action , we will see more and more small communities wither , our big cities will become ever more congested as we continue to pile on top of each other , and the lack of supply will push prices and rents so high that unless you or your parents are very rich , for so many young people , living in your dream home is going to be a pipe dream			1
’ concerned : the deputy prime minister warns that unless radical action is taken to boost housebuilding , for many young people their dreams of a home of their own will be no more than a ' pipe dream ' he said that the shortage of homes for young people has created a ' generational shift ' in the debate , with people becoming more receptive to the idea of new developments which in the past would have been strongly resisted			1
' the babyboomers of the fifties and sixties , people who were largely catered for by the massive housing expansion after the @entity97 , are now watching their children struggle , ' he is expected to say			0
' the plight of the next generation is making what was an abstract housing shortage increasingly tangible and real			0
and as we , as a society , become more open to development that creates the space for politicians to be bold			0
' dr @entity156 , policy director of the @entity157 said : ' unblocking stalled sites alone is not enough			0
we would challenge the government to be more ambitious and increase the @entity161 ’s ( @entity161 ) target by a further 100,000 homes by 2015 , which would provide a substantial return in economic growth			0

deputy prime minister uses speech to say that unless action is taken to boost housebuilding many youngsters will never own a home
we should draw inspiration from garden cities such as @entity43 and @entity44 , he says
