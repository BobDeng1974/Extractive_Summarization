furious @entity0 will write to @entity1 to complain on behalf of their supporters after the governing body revealed they would not take action against @entity6 for allowing fans in to their behind closed doors @entity10 game on tuesday			1
city were flabbergasted to see 300 rowdy @entity12 fans standing drinking beer — itself a breach of @entity10 rules — in the main stand of the @entity17 in @entity18 to watch their side snatch a 2 - 2 draw with a disputed late penalty			2
hearing stories of media passes and sponsor tickets being sold to @entity6 fans and suspicious that security staff may also have let fans through the gates , @entity0 asked @entity1 to look in to the issue			1
around 300 @entity6 fans were in the main stand , despite the match being played behind closed doors the @entity6 fans watched their side come from behind to secure a point against @entity0 @entity1 had ordered the match to be played behind closed doors because of racist behaviour by @entity6 fans official crowd - 0 club delegates - 75 per club centre circle boys and parents - 50 media - 150 @entity1 partners ( sponsors ) - 300 on wednesday though , @entity1 declared themselves happy with the way things had been handled , prompting dismay and anger at @entity0 whose own travelling fans had been prevented by police from reaching an apartment overlooking the stadium from which they planned to watch the game			1
a @entity0 source said last night : ‘ we feel this is wrong and a complete injustice			2
it ’s unfair that in a game that is supposed to be played in an empty stadium , the home club have 300 fans singing and cheering them on and we do n’t have any			1
to us , that ’s not a punishment			0
’ but @entity1 chief of press @entity66 said : ‘ i think the club has already been penalised a lot , less than three per cent of the stadium capacity was in attendance			2
the club is n’t getting gate receipts and the players are n’t getting any meaningful support			0
‘ if we say it ’s behind closed doors , then it ’s supposed to be behind closed doors to the general public , but there are always tickets given to @entity84 , @entity1 staff and sponsors			1
city threw away a two - goal lead as @entity89 and @entity90 scored in the second half for the hosts @entity90 's late penalty made it 2 - 2 after @entity0 had looked comfortable after going two goals ahead in @entity18 @entity95 scored @entity0 's second , sliding home to meet a cross from their first goalscorer @entity99 ‘ following tuesday ’s match between @entity6 and @entity0 , @entity1 has reviewed the officials ’ reports and found no breach of the conditions related to a match played behind closed doors that make part of the disciplinary decision			1
‘ only people who were allowed to enter the stadium ( club delegations , media , security staff , @entity1 and guests of sponsorship partners ) attended the match with no record of inappropriate behaviour			1
‘ however , @entity1 is reviewing the “ behind closed doors ” policy to see if alternative solutions could be implemented in the future			1
’ ‘ our sponsors and partners pay a lot of money to be associated with the competition and are entitled to receive a number of tickets			2
they should n’t have to pay the price for the behaviour of others			0
’ @entity66 said @entity1 ’s reports from @entity18 have shown there was no record of ‘ any inappropriate behaviour in the stands ’			1
he added : ‘ we ca n’t stop a limited number of sponsors and corporate guests from supporting their own team			0
if they decide to show up with a scarf or flag we ca n’t stop that			0
‘ i can tell you , however , that there is an ongoing internal conversation on this issue in general and perhaps we ’ll look to see if there are better solutions			0
’ relations between @entity0 and @entity6 are already at a low ebb following last season ’s @entity10 clash in @entity18 that saw visiting midfielder @entity157 racially abused			1
officials from the @entity12 club subsequently showed their contempt for @entity0 by turning up at an official reception ahead of the return game at the @entity163 dressed in jeans			2
city are now furious at the latest events in @entity18 and captain @entity167 took a dim view of the matter			2
he said : ‘ this one really annoys me and maybe it ’s on top of other things as well			0
players from both teams line up before the match with a @entity178 banner campaigning against racism @entity0 captain @entity167 was not afraid to point out that @entity6 fans were allowed in to watch @entity167 questioned who was being punished after @entity6 fans appeared to have been allowed in despite @entity95 and @entity99 's efforts , the game ended 2 - 2 meaning @entity0 have failed to win in @entity1 this season @entity0 need three good results to ensure they qualify from the group stage , and they can take heart from last season			1
when they play @entity6 next month , it will be exactly a year to the day since they beat them — the first of three straight victories that confirmed their qualification			0
2013 - 14 @entity196 nov 5 ...			0
. @entity0 5 - 2 @entity6 nov 27 ...			1
@entity0 4 - 2 @entity197 dec 10 ...			0
@entity198 2 - 3 @entity0 ‘ you say “ no fans ” then all of a sudden you turn up and basically the only team that has n’t got fans is @entity0			0
so who ’s getting punished ? who is being done for racism ? @entity0 or @entity18 ? ‘ i do n’t have a problem , they ’ll say it ’s sponsors and so on and they need to give certain allocations , but why are we getting punished ? ‘ and again , because you ’ll have people in your papers writing columns saying “ he should be looking at his own performance and stuff ” — so , done , we ’ve analysed it and we know we should have done better			2
but things like this are unacceptable to honest , there ’s just no fairness in it			0
’ @entity0 were leading 2 - 0 at half - time but only took a point in the end after a controversial late penalty gave @entity6 their first point in @entity229 ‘ it does n’t have an effect on the players , ’ said @entity167			1
‘ it ’s just little things when you leave with a result like this			0
‘ obviously you ca n’t deny there ’s a bit of frustration , and i ’m not looking for an excuse , but if you want to play it fair then , fair enough , you ’ve got to let your sponsors have some tickets but why the hell do we not have any fans here ? why ? what have our fans done wrong ? ‘ so it needs to be looked at , it needs to be changed , because our fans should n’t be punished			0
