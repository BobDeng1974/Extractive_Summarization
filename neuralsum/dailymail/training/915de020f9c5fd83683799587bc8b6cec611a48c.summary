by @entity0 published : 11:11 est , 22 march 2012 updated : 11:11 est , 22 march 2012 payments : @entity2 , the former @entity3 prime minister , took nearly 210,000 euros in secret payments while in office and lied about them former @entity3 prime minister @entity2 took at least 209,779 euros in secret payments while in office and repeatedly lied about them under oath , an inquiry has found			1
in a long - awaited end to an investigation into payments to politicians in the @entity16 , three judges also found two other former @entity18 lawmakers guilty of corrupt acts			1
they stopped short of finding @entity2 guilty of corruption because they found no evidence the veteran politician gave favours to any of his cash donors			1
while the report itself was a fact - gathering effort and not a direct finding of any criminal wrongdoing , prime minister @entity26 referred its contents to prosecutors			1
potential offences include corruption , obstruction of justice and tax evasion			1
no @entity3 politicians have been convicted of corruption as a result of the past 15 years of investigations into the bribery culture at the heart of @entity3 property development			1
prosecutions are hampered , in part , by the fact that the government passed no credible anti-bribery laws until 1996 , leaving tax evasion as the only readily proven offence			1
@entity2 , whose often bizarre and implausible 2007 testimony enraptured the nation , denied doing anything wrong but resigned from office in 2008 after 11 years in power			2
he was not at his @entity57 home today but issued a brief statement saying he was reading the report			2
his longtime accountant and personal friend , @entity62 , conceded that mr @entity2 's testimony had been hard to swallow , but said the judges could n't prove the former pm was lying			1
' the fact that something is bizarre does not make it untrue			2
some aspects of his finances were bizarre , ' mr @entity62 said			2
@entity2 's former special adviser in government , @entity71 , described the findings as ' far worse than anything i expected or believed possible			1
' ' he told me he was telling the truth , ' mr @entity71 said			2
' his narrative is not believed , and it is damning and it is serious			2
... his reputation has been very seriously damaged			2
' several lawmakers in @entity18 called on its current leader , @entity83 , to expel @entity2 from the party as punishment			1
mr @entity83 has called a meeting of party officials to discuss the matter tonight			2
@entity90 , left , a former cabinet minister and @entity93 commissioner , and another @entity18 lawmaker , @entity95 , right , another former lawmaker , were both found to have received corrupt payments voters last year ousted @entity18 from power and decimated its parliamentary ranks , a historic defeat driven by @entity3 's humiliating negotiation of an international bailout			1
@entity2 , 60 , did not seek re-election			2
interest in the judges ' final 3,211 - page report - the product of a 15 - year investigation expected to cost taxpayers more than 200million euros ( £ 167million ) - was so great that the investigators ' web site repeatedly crashed			0
' much of the explanation provided by mr @entity2 as to the source of the substantial funds identified and inquired into in the course of the tribunal 's public hearings was deemed by the tribunal to be untrue , ' the judges found			1
they accused @entity2 's government , which founded the original fact - finding tribunal in 1997 , of launching a sustained attack on their work once the target of their investigation turned out to be @entity2 himself			0
during his 15 days of testimony in 2007 , @entity2 admitted keeping most of the money in personal safes at his office and home from 1992 to 1994			0
he also admitted failing to keep a personal bank account during much of the time under investigation and paying no tax on any of the cash until the investigators uncovered its existence			0
@entity2 testified that undocumented cash payments he received while in @entity143 were all unsolicited gifts , while identical payments he received in @entity3 were loans			0
under tax law at the time , overseas gifts and domestic loans were not taxable			0
@entity2 made no repayments on the 1993 ' loans ' until the investigators discovered them in 2007			0
he ultimately negotiated a tax settlement for the unearthed funds			0
the judges repeatedly dismissed @entity2 's explanations for the source of myriad @entity160 cash payments in @entity3 pounds , @entity143 pounds and @entity161 dollars that eventually were deposited into accounts in the name of his then - girlfriend , @entity165 , and his two daughters			0
he claimed to have won much of the money betting on horses			0
they rejected testimony provided by @entity2 and several business friends who claimed to have raised money for him without his consent at a pub event in december 1993			0
the judges instead accepted as truthful the testimony of a senior @entity57 stockbroker whom @entity2 had identified as one of those friends			0
the stockbroker said he barely knew @entity181 and had been asked by @entity18 to make a 5,000 euro ( £ 4,166 ) political donation in a check made out to @entity2 , which he did			1
the judges said they could not prove or rule out allegations by an @entity3 property developer , @entity187 , that a rival developer paid @entity2 two bribes in 1989 and 1992 totaling more than 100,000 euros ( £ 83,328 )			0
mr @entity187 testified that he bribed @entity90 , a former cabinet minister and @entity93 commissioner , and another @entity18 lawmaker , @entity95 , as part of his unsuccessful effort to develop a @entity57 shopping center			1
the judges accepted that mr @entity187 paid @entity90 about 63,500 euros ( £ 52,913 ) , which the @entity93 commissioner used towards buying a farm in his wife 's name			0
they found that the businessman paid @entity95 £ 75,000 ( 91,000 euros ) , and that both payments were corrupt			1
@entity95 was briefly imprisoned several times for obstructing the tribunal 's work and was killed in a @entity207 car crash in 2005 while on a personal trip to buy properties			0
personally popular : in his 2007 testimony to the @entity211 , @entity2 admitted keeping most of the cash in safes and not paying any tax on the money @entity2 , who cultivated a persona as an affable and plain - spoken @entity57 , was personally popular while in office and credited with leading a frugal personal life			0
he was @entity18 's fund - raising director in the early @entity160 and a protege of former prime minister @entity221 , who was found guilty by a previous tribunal of receiving more than 10million euros ( £ 8.3million ) in secret payments from many of @entity3 's top businessmen while in office			1
@entity221 faced no criminal charges , paid taxes and penalties of 6.5million euros ( £ 5.4million ) , and died in 2006 .			0

two other former @entity18 lawmakers are found guilty of corruption
