by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 1:29 am on 14th december 2011 email exchange : documents have shown that @entity4 received a message in 2008 saying hacking at the @entity6 was ' rife ' but he claims he did n't read it @entity9 chief @entity4 was sent details of claims that phone - hacking was ‘ rife ’ at the @entity6 in 2008 , explosive new emails have revealed			1
mr @entity4 was contacted by the paper ’s then editor @entity13 which discussed the decision to settle a court case with footballers ’ union chief @entity17			1
the exchanges between @entity6 executives and lawyers warn that mr @entity17 was determined to ‘ demonstrate what happened to him was rife throughout the organisation			2
’ mr @entity13 , who forwarded the email exchanges to mr @entity4 , added : ‘ unfortunately it is as bad as we feared ’			1
in the email dated saturday , june 7 , 2008 , mr @entity13 went on to ask for ‘ five minutes ’ with him the following tuesday			2
mr @entity4 replies two minutes later saying : ‘ no worries			0
i am in during the afternoon			0
if you want to talk before i ’ll be home tonight after seven and most of the day tomorrow			0
’ mr @entity4 has repeatedly denied he had any knowledge that phone hacking at the @entity32 went beyond one ‘ rogue ’ reporter			2
the @entity9 chief yesterday stuck to these claims saying he was ‘ confident ’ that he had not read the full email chain			1
his denials have been disputed by former executives who say they discussed a crucial email proving that hacking was more widespread at the subsequent meeting on 10 june 2008			1
the email - known as the ‘ for @entity44 ’ email – implied that the practice went beyond mr @entity46 , who was jailed in 2007 after pleading guilty to phone hacking			2
@entity49 reply : @entity4 responded just two minutes after receiving this email from @entity13 , later claiming that he did not read the full email chain below it correspondence : the second page of emails between @entity56 and @entity57 talking about the case involving @entity59 chief @entity17 mr @entity13 and former @entity9 legal chief @entity57 have told mps the email was the sole reason for deciding to pay a settlement of £ 425,000 to mr @entity17			1
mr @entity4 insists that the meeting was simply to authorise an increased settlement offer to mr @entity17 and that he was not shown the email or told that it proved that wrong - doing was more widespread than previously thought			1
in a letter to mps on the @entity71 , mr @entity4 yesterday said he could not have read the email exchange in full because of the ‘ timing of my response , just over two minutes after mr @entity13 sent his email to me , and the fact that i typically received emails on my @entity78 on weekends			1
@entity4 's reply : this is the letter the @entity9 chief sent to the @entity71 select committee saying that he did not read the email properly ‘ instead , having agreed to meet the following tuesday , i would have relied on the oral briefing on 10 june 2008 that i have previously described in my testimony before the committee			1
‘ i would also like to take this opportunity to reaffirm my past testimony that i was not aware of evidence that either pointed to widespread wrongdoing or indicated that further investigation was necessary			0
’ yesterday mr @entity57 admitted to the @entity94 inquiry into press standards that the paper ’s attempts to blame the phone hacking scandal on a single ‘ rogue reporter ’ would ‘ come back and bite it ’			2
he accepted there was the appearance of ‘ a cover - up ’ at the paper after former royal editor @entity46 was jailed for phone hacking in january 2007			0
meeting : @entity13 and @entity57 say they told mr @entity4 about the notorious ' for @entity44 ' email which said hacking was not limited to a single reporter during a meeting with him on june 10 , 2008			1
@entity4 denies they did so mr @entity57 , head of legal at @entity9 for 20 years , said he became aware ‘ other journalists ’ might have hacked phones after @entity46 was jailed			1
claims : the email exchange concerned allegations made by @entity59 head @entity17 , and are thought to be the sole reason he received a £ 425,000 pay off he said his view was based on private detective @entity120 pleading guilty to hacking five ‘ @entity122 victims ’ , who were not hacked by @entity46			1
these included supermodel @entity125 , the publicist @entity126 , footballers union boss @entity17 and @entity127			0
@entity128 , @entity129 , counsel for the inquiry , asked if ‘ the party line being peddled ’ that there was only one rogue reporter ever caused concern			0
mr @entity57 said : ‘ yes			0
my feeling is i thought it would probably come back to bite the people who were saying it			0
’ asked if he was concerned there was a ‘ culture of cover - up ’ , mr @entity57 said ‘ to some extent			0
’ the inquiry also heard from @entity56 , a partner at the law firm @entity143 , which advised @entity9			0
he said he believed the ‘ rogue reporter ’ defence was untrue and unsustainable after the police disclosed evidence in the @entity17 privacy case brought against @entity9 , in april 2008 , in which mr @entity17 was paid more than £ 700,000 in damages and costs			2
he told the inquiry it was ‘ self evident ’ that @entity9 did not want allegations about its ‘ culture of illegal information access ’ aired in public .			0

@entity9 chief says he did not read email exchange
@entity13 and @entity57 claim they told @entity4 hacking was rife in meeting three days after email was sent in june 2008
messages concerned claims by @entity59 chief @entity17 , whose phone was hacked
