@entity0 has become one of @entity3 's most prolific astronaut photographers during his expeditions aboard the @entity5 from star trails to auroras , @entity0 's engineering ingenuity and natural curiosity has led him to create photos that are unrivalled in their beauty			1
at one point , he saturated the @entity5 ' downlink transfers with photos for three full days from just one 30 - minute photographic session in space			1
to capture the light trails , @entity0 took multiple 30 - second exposures and combined them digitally to create images that resembled 10 - to 15 - minute exposures			1
this image shows stars , auroras and thunderstorms across the surface of the @entity20 now filmmaker @entity31 , who works at photo sharing website , @entity33 , has created a captivating time - lapse featuring some of @entity0 's best photos of the @entity20			1
' we get training on photography and the use of the cameras on space station , ' explained @entity0			1
' and these are professional - level cameras â€¦ they 're almost like a little computer in themselves			0
' astronauts on the @entity5 are asked to take pictures of @entity20 and its surrounding , providing a scientific data set that has been recorded now for over 14 years			1
about 1.2 million pictures were taken as of july 2012 and that number is growing			2
' these images are also art , ' said @entity0			1
' they illustrate to people what space is like for those who do n't get a chance to fly in space			2
@entity58 eyed : from star trails to auroras , @entity0 's engineering ingenuity and natural curiosity has led him to create photos that are unrivalled in their beauty			1
this image shows an aurora forming above @entity20 as solar winds hit the planet 's magnetosphere stunning : @entity0 shot this time - lapse photos while aboard the @entity5 in 2012			1
astronauts on the @entity5 are asked to take pictures of @entity20 and its surrounding , providing a scientific data set that has been recorded now for over 14 years view from above : most images on the @entity5 are taken in the cupola , where there are often as up to eight cameras set up with different lenses			1
at times , astronauts compete with each other for the best position one of @entity0 's favourite cameras is the 400mm f / 2			1
' in weightlessness , this becomes a beautiful piece of equipment to use , ' said @entity0			1
' you can completely control it by grabbing on to the camera			2
and it 's heavy enough that small things like your heartbeat wo n't make the lens jiggle			0
' if you pick up a camera body with a small lens on it , the pulse in your fingers will make the camera shake			2
' to get around this , @entity0 taped a stick on the back of the camera , which allowed him to move the equipment with just two fingers			1
this meant that he could fly the camera around without physically having his fingers on the camera			2
and since the stick was aligned with the optical centre , he could slowly rotate the camera through 360 degrees			2
' looking at @entity20 from space is amazingly beautiful , ' said @entity0			1
' you can see things on the length scale of half a continent			0
but he argues that photos of @entity20 from space are no more beautiful than those taken from @entity20			1
' it 's just a different perspective of what we 're used to seeing , ' he said			0
@entity128 - photographer : @entity0 ( pictured ) , 59 , is a veteran of two long - duration stays aboard the @entity5 , one space shuttle mission and a six - week expedition to find meteorites in @entity133 what are some of your favourite subjects to photograph from space ? my favourite subject is the earth at night			1
@entity142 is just amazingly beautiful			0
it 's this glowing upper part of the atmosphere that crawls around like amoebas in the sky			2
other aspects of night - time photography : atmospheric air glow			2
originally people thought the atmosphere glowed more or less uniformly			0
but the pictures we 're taking on station show that there 's spatial structure in the atmospheric air glow			1
then there 's polar mesospheric clouds , also known as noctilucent clouds			2
these are clouds in the upper part of the atmosphere , right on the fringes of space , that are sort of a scientific mystery in terms of why they form			1
the way human beings sprinkle their light bulbs around is a fascinating statement on how we as human beings define our urban areas			0
it 's a juxtaposition between geography , technology that you choose , and culture			0
what are some of your photographic challenges in space ? the traits that make a good photograph on @entity20 still apply to taking a picture in space			1
in space , you can have huge variations in brightness			1
the sunny - 16 rule sort of applies , but you have to add or subtract about 2 more f - stops because the full exoatmospheric sun on the tops of clouds is really bright			2
if you just take a standard picture , the cloud tops will all be snow white with no detail at all			0
so you need to underexpose your picture when you have a lot of clouds within your field of view			0
the green part of the aurora is about two stops brighter than the red part			0
if you expose for the greens , you wo n't see the reds			0
if you expose for the reds , the greens will be saturated			0
we see these same things on @entity20 , compromising between what you can and ca n't see			0
how did you create your star trail images ? star trail images have been photographed by amateur astronomers for years			1
you put your camera on a tripod , point it some place up in the sky , then as @entity20 turns while the shutter 's open , the stars make trails			1
i tried the same thing from station			0
the dynamics are the same , but the physics behind the motions are different			0
you still see stars going in circles , but they 're not going in circles around the north star , they 're going in circles around the pitch access of station as it goes around @entity20			0
you also see cities streak by on the surface of @entity20			0
they move with a combination of our orbital motion and @entity20 turning at the same time			0
then you 've got the atmosphere on edge , and it glows			0
scientists call that air glow			0
q&a by photo - sharing site , @entity33 speeding bullet : ' star trail images have been photographed by amateur astronomers for years			1
you put your camera on a tripod , point it some place up in the sky , then as @entity20 turns while the shutter 's open , the stars make trails , ' said @entity275 no filter : about 1.2 million pictures were taken as of july 2012 and that number is growing			1
this incredible image of @entity20 's oceans was taken by @entity0 during one of his stays aboard the @entity5 window seat : a view of @entity20 and the @entity5 ' solar panels as seen from one of the windows of the cupola , where most of the space photography takes place ' we find @entity20 from space exceptionally beautiful because we 're so polarised to the natural beauty around us when we 're walking on @entity20			1
' but not all of the photography involves capturing the stunning views of @entity20 from space			0
' there 's a lot of engineering photography that we do , ' said @entity0			1
' we have to take macro images of pins in an electrical connector or a bit of grunge in a hydraulic quick - disconnect fitting or little patterns that might develop on the surface of one of the windows			0
these things need to be documented so the images can be downlinked for engineers on the ground to assess what 's happening to the systems on space station			1
most images on the @entity5 are taken in the cupola , where there are often as up to eight cameras set up with different lenses			1
at times , astronauts compete with each other for the best position			0
' say a volcano 's going off , ' said @entity0			2
' maybe one crewmate has a 400mm , maybe one has a midrange 85 - 180mm lens			0
' and then someone 's shooting with a wide - angle lens			0
we 're all shooting at the same subject at the same time in this rather small space			2
' ' it makes my heart sing to see people using my pictures , ' added @entity0			2
' there 's no point in taking pictures and hiding them in a closet			0
' you want to take pictures and share them freely with anybody who 's willing to look at your photography			0
and that , to me , is more of a compliment than anything else			0
' incredible : ' you see cities streak by on the surface of @entity20 , ' said @entity0			2
' they move with a combination of our orbital motion and @entity20 turning at the same time '			0
in this images , @entity0 attempted to capture both the stars and the city lights using long exposure photography dream team : on the left is a crew shot taken during @entity21 some days before they captured the first @entity370 commercial spacecraft			1
on the left is @entity372 , centre is @entity374 and right , @entity0			2
the right image shows the team posing onboard the @entity5 looking back : ' it makes my heart sing to see people using my pictures , ' said @entity0			1
' there 's no point in taking pictures and hiding them '			0

@entity0 has taken a huge number of photos during his expeditions aboard the @entity5
@entity391 filmmaker , @entity31 , has created a captivating time lapse featuring some of the best images
the images show star trails , oceans , clouds , huge storms , auroras and city lights glowing around the world
@entity0 reveals the *difficulties* of taking good images in space , *including* *handling* a camera in *microgravity*
