the mayor of @entity9 attacked the ' @entity10 on a trip to @entity12 and said he had won the 2010 battle with his brother because to him family ties are ' trivial '			1
in an extraordinary attack he said mr @entity5 was a ' socialist ' who views individuals as ' discrete agents devoid of ties to society or to each other , and that ’s how @entity25 could murder 20 million people '			2
i think he 'd be brilliant ' , he said , and when asked if @entity2 would be prime minister before him he added : ' i think it is very likely '			0
but he denied he would commit political fratricide			0
we do n't do things that way , that 's a very left - wing thing , ' he told the @entity12 newspaper			1
' only a socialist could do that to his brother , only a socialist could regard familial ties as being so trivial as to shaft his own brother			1
i mean , unbelievable ! ' only lefties can think like that they see people as discrete agents devoid of ties to society or to each other , and that 's how @entity25 could murder 20 million people			1
' rivalry : @entity5 beat his brother @entity7 to the @entity70 leadership in 2010 , and his sibling has quit politics openly saying he was hurt by what happened the falling out over the notorious @entity70 leadership battle between the @entity75 still refuses to heal fully			0
@entity76 , who quit as an mp and now lives in @entity78 , said last month : ' the truth is that these things , you can never erase them from memory			0
41 - year - old @entity37 's appointment as the head of @entity87 ’s policy unit took most people in @entity89 by surprise			2
the quiet promotion of the old @entity92 , who has only been an mp for only three years , was the idea of chancellor @entity94			0
apart from harnessing journalist @entity2 ’s strategic skills in a bid to make the @entity97 more popular , the move is seen as a way to rein in @entity1 , and it appears to have worked .			0

mayor of @entity9 says @entity2 will beat him to *no.* 10 but he would n't fight it
' we do n't do things that way , that 's a very left - wing thing , ' he said
' only a socialist could regard familial ties as so trivial as to shaft his own brother . i mean , unbelievable ! that 's how @entity25 could murder *20m* people '
