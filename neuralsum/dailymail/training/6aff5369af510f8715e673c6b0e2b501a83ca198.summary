by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 19:26 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 20:36 est , 7 november 2013 president @entity2 personally apologized on thursday to the millions of @entity1 who have lost their individual health insurance plans as a consequence of the @entity6 becoming law			1
' i am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me , ' the president said			1
' we ’ve got to work hard to make sure that they know we hear them , and that we ’re going to do everything we can to deal with folks who find themselves in a tough position as a consequence of this			0
' @entity2 's surprising mea culpa came during a wide - ranging interview with @entity24			2
' first of all , i meant what i said , ' he insisted during thursday 's interview with @entity24 reporter @entity42 , ' and we worked hard to try to make sure that we implemented that properly ' but obviously we did n't do a good enough job			2
' @entity2 ultimately dissembled , though , blaming @entity1 ' anger and late - night comedians ' jokes on a lack of clarity – not on a politically expedient lie			1
' i regret very much that what we intended to do – which is to make sure that everybody is moving into better plans because they want ' em , as opposed to because they 're forced into it – that , you know , we were n't as clear as we needed to be			0
' ' hey b ! you lied , ' wrote one @entity64 cancellation victim			0
he said @entity65 was the only participant in his health care marketplace , resulting in a plan costing $ 4,000 more per year with a higher deductible cancellation letters have hit an estimated 2.5 million @entity1 , and some analysts predict a total near 12 million by year 's end the president also repeated an explanation that his spokespersons have articulated often in recent weeks : that only ' 5 per cent of the population , in what 's called the individual market ' were affected by the rash of cancellations that some analysts predict will top 12 million			1
the @entity82 reported thursday that 250,000 people in @entity84 alone are in that group			0
' a lot of these plans ' that they 're losing , @entity2 claimed for the third time in two weeks , ' are sub-par plans			2
' he seemed to acknowledge for the first time , however , that some @entity1 were content with those insurance policies			1
' @entity93 since then have bought subpar plans ' on their own , @entity2 conceded			1
' and now that may be all they can afford			0
' he also claimed that many people with cancelled policies will find better and cheaper options in the government - run exchanges than they did before the federal government began to control the market			0
' the majority of folks will end up being better off , ' @entity2 said			2
' of course , because the website 's not working right , they do n't necessarily know it , right ?			0

@entity2 promised more than two dozen times that ' if you like your health care plan , you can keep your health care plan ' under @entity6
but at least 2.5 million @entity1 have lost their individual medical insurance policies since the @entity6 became law
@entity2 calls them ' subpar ' plans but admits that 's all some can afford
' i am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation , ' he said thursday , ' based on assurances they got from me '
