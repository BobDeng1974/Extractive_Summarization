teenagers @entity0 and @entity2 look like any normal young couple posing in their swimwear			1
it is hard to believe that just two years ago @entity0 was a girl called @entity7 , and @entity2 was a boy called @entity9			1
@entity0 , 17 , and @entity2 , 19 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , have both undergone surgeries to change their gender and now are enjoying being in their bodies they always wished for			1
now , @entity0 , who is still at school , has undergone an operation to remove both of his breasts , and is proudly showing off his new male physique			2
for the last year , @entity0 has been binding up his chest to try to hide his female body , but can now go topless for the first time after his surgery in @entity46 , @entity47 , in june			2
he said : ' now i can wear a tank top , which i could n't before , i can go swimming shirtless , i can walk outside , i can just be a regular guy now			2
' i hated my breasts , i always felt like they did n't belong - now i can finally be comfortable in my own body			0
' he added : ' now when i 'm out in a public pool , or lifting weights , no - one raises an eyebrow , they just think i 'm a guy - just a skinny dude in the gym trying to build some muscle			0
enjoying life : the teenagers say that they are now both comfortable in their own bodies defining themselves : last year @entity2 had a $ 35,000 sex change surgery to turn her into a woman - and now @entity0 has followed his dream to have a flat , male chest following an operation ' my family have really surprised me with how supportive they have been throughout the surgery			1
i 'm so lucky to have them and @entity2 to rely on			2
' @entity2 and @entity0 met nearly two years ago at a support group for transgender teenagers and bonded through their shared experiences			1
@entity2 said : ' to me , @entity0 's just my @entity0 , he 's always looked manly to me			1
but now he 's had the surgery he 's much more confident and comfortable with himself			0
' but now that the teens ' physical appearance matches their gender , both of them are excited to be able to go swimming , boating and sunbathe like other couples			2
@entity2 added : ' being transgender myself , i understand @entity0 probably better than anybody else , how good he feels and how complete he feels			1
' true love : the couple have been able to rely on each other through their transformation happy and healthy : @entity0 and @entity2 pose in their swimwear at the lake and later looking casual at home @entity97 : the couple were both bullied and lost friends who could not cope with their changes in the future , @entity0 might consider having genital surgery , but this can be complicated , and for now he 's delighted with his new body			1
both the couple 's families are supportive of their relationship and say the way the way the teenagers have supported each other has helped in their transition			2
@entity0 's mum @entity114 said : ' seeing @entity2 go through her surgery was helpful to @entity0			1
' it was being around it and seeing her getting to transform			0
and being a couple at the time was i think just the cherry on the cake			2
changed lives : @entity124 , before she became @entity0 , at the age of five in @entity10 , @entity11 ( left ) and @entity126 ( right ) , before he became @entity2 , aged seven ' every transgender person would love to have the transformation physically because it just completes them as a person			1
' the last two years have been very difficult for the teenagers			0
@entity2 was bullied at school , and @entity0 had to change to a different high school when he revealed he was transgender , and has lost friends in the process			1
' i lost one of my best friends through the transition , ' said @entity0			2
' we used to go on vacations together and were like sisters			0
making a splash : the couple met at a group that supports transgender teens ' but i got the chance to open her eyes and show her i 'm still a good person			1
i 'm still the person i was , i just look different			0
' she was gone for a while but then she came back			0
' it taught me that the people who really love you need some time , but they 'll always come back around			0
' happy : @entity0 had an operation to remove his breasts and is proud of his new physique after he began dressing as a boy , @entity0 also lost a new male friend who learned about his past as a girl			1
' he said : '' i pictured you as a girl , and i ca n't do it anymore , '' ' said @entity0 , adding : ' you ca n't just force people to be your friends			2
' @entity2 started her degree course at an @entity11 university last autumn but has struggled to make new friends because of prejudices against transgender people in the traditional @entity178			1
she said : ' i had quite a lot of friends in college that were really close to me and then all of a sudden they just stopped talking to me			0
' i think what happened is they found out i was trans through a story or word of mouth and they decided that was too much for them			0
' the last two years have also been difficult for the teenager 's families as they 've come to terms with losing their son and daughter , and also some of their own friends			0
@entity0 's mum @entity114 said : ' there are still a group of people we do n't interact with any more			1
i know that they questioned me as a parent , they 're not comfortable with it			0
' but she added : ' a lot of people worry about losing the gender of their child			0
but as you look through albums and realise your babies are growing up , we also watched them grow up and turn into somebody different			0
' whether they stay the same gender or not , they become independent			0
' now their outward transformation is complete , the teenagers hope people will accept them as their new genders , and their difficulties will become a thing of the past			0
young romance : the couple have been together for two years carefree teens : @entity2 and @entity0 have both had the loving support of their families while they made the life - altering decision			1
