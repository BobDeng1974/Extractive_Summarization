by @entity1 reporter published : 12:09 est , 22 october 2012 updated : 01:42 est , 23 october 2012 the @entity2 may be an awe inspiring sight for us here on @entity5 , but a new image of the @entity8 landscape puts it into perspective - with a canyon over 4000m long and 10km deep			1
the astonishing new images , released today by the @entity12 , show the @entity13 , believed to be the largest canyon in the @entity15			1
stretching over 4000 km long and 200 km wide , and with a dizzying depth of 10 km , it is some ten times longer and five times deeper than @entity5 ’s @entity2 , a size that earns it the status of the largest canyon in the @entity15			1
@entity13 , stretching over 4000 km long and 200 km wide , and with a dizzying depth of 10 km , it is ten times longer and five times deeper than @entity5 's @entity2 the @entity2 is 277 miles ( 446 km ) long , up to 18 miles ( 29 km ) wide and attains a depth of over a mile ( 6,000 feet / 1,800 metres ) at its deepest point			1
nearly two billion years of the @entity5 's geological history have been exposed by the @entity25 and its tributaries as they cut their channels through layer after layer of rock while the @entity32 was uplifted , creating a vast area that has become hugely popular with tourists			0
the bird ’s - eye view of @entity13 was created from data captured during 20 individual orbits of @entity12 ’s @entity38			1
@entity12 says a wide variety of geological features can be seen , reflecting the complex geological history of the region			0
' the canyon ’s formation is likely intimately linked with the formation of the neighbouring @entity47 bulge , which is out of shot and to the left of this image and home to the largest volcano in the @entity15 , @entity53 , ' it said			0
' the volcanic activity is revealed by the nature of the rocks in the walls of the canyon and the surrounding plains , which were built by successive lava flows			0
' as the @entity47 bulge swelled with magma during the planet ’s first billion years , the surrounding crust was stretched , ripping apart and eventually collapsing into the gigantic troughs of @entity13			2
. the images also show intricate fault patterns believed to have developed due to the imposing extensional forces ; the most recent are particularly evident in the middle portion of the image and along the lower boundary of the frame			0
@entity13 , stretching over 4000 km long and 200 km wide , and with a dizzying depth of 10 km , it is ten times longer and five times deeper than @entity76 s @entity2 landslides have also played a role in shaping the scene , @entity12 officials said , especially in the northern-most troughs , where material has recently slumped down the steep walls			1
mass wasting has also created delicate erosion of the highest part of the walls			0
strong water flows may have reshaped @entity13 after it was formed , deepening the canyon			2
mineralogical information collected by orbiting spacecraft , including @entity38 , shows that the terrain here was altered by water hundreds of millions of years ago			0
@entity95 , which shows of earth 's greatest canyon - but which is dwarfed by the latest images of @entity8 canyons			2

@entity13 stretches over 4000 km long and 200 km wide , with a depth of 10 km
new images reveal the canyon in *unprecedented* detail - and in colour for the first time
