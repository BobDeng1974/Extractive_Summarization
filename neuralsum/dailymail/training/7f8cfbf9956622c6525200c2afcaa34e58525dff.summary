@entity0 is convinced @entity1 will cope with the searing pressure of an @entity4 debut against the @entity5 — aided by the perspective gained from his active service in @entity9			1
the national coach yesterday confirmed that @entity13 ’s @entity12 - born wing — a @entity14 in the @entity15 — would line up on the right flank opposite @entity5 ’s try - scoring phenomenon , @entity18			1
the collision between the tank - driving soldier and a fellow power - runner of @entity24 descent , known as the ‘ bus ’ , will provide a focal point at @entity27 on saturday as @entity4 start their @entity29 autumn series against the world champions			1
@entity1 fires out a pass during @entity4 training at @entity33 in @entity34 on thursday @entity1 will line up against powerful @entity5 winger @entity18 at @entity27 on saturday the @entity12 - born winger 's aerial skills will certainly be tested by @entity5 fly - half @entity38 such exalted visitors and a high - stakes occasion in front of a full house of 82,000 at @entity43 make for a daunting prospect for a newcomer , but @entity0 understandably believes the only uncapped player in his starting xv will handle a situation far removed from the life - and - death danger he faced on a tour of duty in @entity50			1
‘ he ’s probably one of the least nervous players in the squad , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ in training we put the players under a lot of pressure , in various scenarios			0
i have n’t seen him make an error			0
' the different experiences he has had — not just within rugby but outside the game — have given him that confidence to be ready for a game like this			0
you never really find out until you put them in the front line , but he ’s got the necessary experience			1
’ @entity1 is a a @entity14 in the @entity15 and has served in @entity9 @entity1 's performances for the @entity75 on the @entity76 caught the eye of @entity13 coach @entity78 the front line is familiar territory for @entity1 , 27			1
the military life was a family tradition which he embraced from the age of 19 until , as he put it , ‘ rugby started popping up ’ — first with the @entity75 , then with @entity13 and now with the country he has made his home and for which he has fought			1
soon after being deployed to @entity9 , a colleague on patrol stepped on a landmine and lost both legs			1
that memory stays with him and has spurred him on to chase his ambitions with gusto			0
‘ every single time i join the camp , here or at @entity13 , i always think about this stuff — going back three or four years when that incident happened and that marine soldier was badly injured , ’ he said			2
‘ it gives me a boost to make the most of every opportunity because you do n’t know what ’s going to happen next			2
there could be a serious injury on the rugby field			0
you have to give everything you ’ve got			0
’ @entity1 ( left ) , in action against @entity115 in october , has been in superb form for @entity13 this season despite the vast contrasts between his burgeoning rugby career and the military one which has been placed on hold , @entity1 actually accentuates the similarities			1
he argues that both occupations require diligence , precision and a band - of - brothers commitment to teamwork and supporting mates alongside			0
it ’s just that the consequences of mistakes vary wildly			0
looking ahead to his test debut , he said : ‘ it is similar to the pressure i felt out there in @entity9 , especially in the field			2
out there in @entity9 you had to be spot on with your drills , be punctual , dress correctly and be disciplined			2
you had to be alert every single moment			0
‘ that sort of mentality fits in well on the rugby pitch			0
you need all those key points out there on the field			0
the only difference is that here , there is always a next time			0
next week you can come back stronger and better			0
out in @entity9 you have to be on top of your drills every single time because if you mess up that can cost someone their life			2
’ at this time of year , it was especially poignant to see a soldier wearing a poppy and reflecting on the prospect of national service of a different kind			0
@entity1 appreciates the significance of the timing , while the country has been marking the centenary of the start of @entity167			2
@entity1 poses for a portrait in his @entity4 shirt on thursday as he gets ready to earn his first @entity171 cap ‘ it ’s a massive thing , especially on @entity173 , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s not just representing @entity4 , my family and @entity13 ; it ’s representing the whole @entity176 in @entity9 , back in their units			1
i ’m representing every single one of them			0
’ on a lighter note , the messages @entity1 has received have contained a few digs from @entity75 colleagues whose hearts lie north of the border			2
‘ some of the lads have said , ‘ you deserve it , you ’ve done well ’ , ’ he said			0
‘ but my unit is a @entity190 unit , so some of my @entity75 team - mates are saying , ‘ why are you playing for them ? you should be playing for @entity194 ! ’ @entity4 are glad to have him , in a rejigged back line			1
as expected , @entity197 ’s scorching form for @entity13 earned him another shot at inside centre			1
he will form a midfield alliance with @entity201 , who has been recalled , according to @entity0 , to provide balance as a carrier who can get over the gainline and off - load			1
the head coach insisted that the untried 10 - 12 - 13 axis of @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity201 has shown great cohesion in training			1
what the hosts ca n’t match is the @entity5 ’ unrivalled experience			2
@entity4 ’s line - up is far more youthful , as @entity0 jokingly acknowledged , saying : ‘ we were watching a game the other day , i think it was from 2003 — before the @entity217 and @entity218 was playing in it			1
@entity220 was on the bench			0
most of our players were about 10 years old at that point ! ’			0

@entity12 - born wing @entity1 is a @entity14 in the @entity15 and has served in @entity9
@entity1 will line up against @entity5 ’s try - scoring phenomenon , @entity18
the @entity13 winger will win his first international cap in front of a sell - out 82,000 *crowd* at @entity27
@entity4 head coach @entity0 has selected an untried 10 - 12 - 13 axis of @entity209 , @entity197 and @entity201 to face the @entity5
