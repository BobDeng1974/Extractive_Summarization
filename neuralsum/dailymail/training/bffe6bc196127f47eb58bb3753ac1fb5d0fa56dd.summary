' i noticed that the machine only half filled the cup so i brought this to the attention of a staff member nearby , who came over to look at the machine , ' he said			0
' as i was short of time , and not wanting to wait for the fault to be rectified , i took what coffee i had and returned to the school bus i was driving			2
branch : mr @entity4 , a gardener , picked up the coffee from the store @entity9 , @entity10 the advert reads : nothing says ' welcome ' more than a lovely hot cup of tea or coffee ' i was pleased that the coffee was n’t as hot as usual , enabling me to take a large glup			1

' a spokesman for @entity2 said : ' we are so sorry this happened			2
