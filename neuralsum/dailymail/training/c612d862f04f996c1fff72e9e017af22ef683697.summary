a new documentary vows to expose the dark underbelly of pig farming and allegedly contains video of pigs sleeping in their own urine , buckets of stillborn piglets and the bashing of animals with metal rods			1
animal rights activist @entity11 has put together a documentary called @entity13 which contains footage taken from inside 50 @entity16 piggeries and slaughterhouses			1
but @entity16 's peak body representing pig farmers said the film was not representative of what was happening in the industry			1
a spokesperson for the @entity24 told @entity25 ' the footage does not represent @entity16 pork producers in a fair and equitable light			1
it is skewed to totally misrepresent the industry '			2
' they 're confined in filthy conditions where pigs are forced to sleep in their own urine and waste , ' mr @entity11 told @entity25			1
' for the sows , it 's a cycle of getting impregnated , moved into sow stalls then crates where they give birth , then their piglets are taken away and they are impregnated again			2
' a few cycles of that and the mortality rate increase for piglets – not always – but after two or three years they 're replaced with younger pigs and sent off to be slaughtered			2
' the mechanical way they are treated as units of productions is inhumane			0
' the activist said he wanted to make @entity13 to ensure people made informed decisions about what they were buying in the supermarket			2
' i would love for people to open their eyes and a lot of this unknown to a lot of people , ' he said			0
animal rights activist @entity11 compiled the documentary , @entity13 , from footage he received from across @entity16 he said he had received video from 50 different locations			1
it is claimed this pig was from @entity89 in @entity90 where the sow is believed to have been gnawing at its front paws after getting paralysis in its back legs ' people who buy pig products do n't know what 's involved in bringing it into the supermarket			0
' i want people to see what is happening so they can make an informed decision about what they 're buying			0
' mr @entity11 also slammed the use of carbon dioxide chambers to render beasts unconscious before they are slaughtered			2
' it 's touted as the most humane method ... but in footage we 've received , the pigs are seen thrashing and squealing for 30 seconds , ' he said			2
' it 's quite distressing and that 's how most pigs are being stunned before they are killed			0
' it has been claimed this pig living inside the @entity118 piggery had its tail cut off at @entity122 piggery across the road mr @entity11 said the way sows were treated as ' units of productions ' was inhumane mr @entity11 said he also saw footage of people ' bashing ' pigs with metal rods in a @entity90 slaughterhouse after the stunning process did not work properly			1
the activist said it was not his place to suggest a better way of slaughtering animals because he did not believe in the practice			0
' it 's talking about better ways to do the wrong thing , ' he said			0
but a spokeswoman for @entity144 questioned the intentions behind mr @entity11 's documentary			1
she said the footage was only designed for shock value and was not about exposing animal cruelty			1
@entity13 aims to help people make more ' informed decisions ' when buying pork products in the supermarket but @entity144 said the footage was not representative of normal practices within the industry a spokeswoman for the organisation said the documentary was being used as a tool of ' shock ' than a piece on animal rights ' this [ footage ] is not normal practice for @entity16 pig farmers and the animal activist 's desire is bring to a halt intensive animal farming for human consumption , ' the spokeswoman said			1
' it 's not about welfare			0
if it was about genuine welfare of animals , film footage would not have been sat on for months - up to a year in one case - and reported immediately to the relevant authorities if it was of concern			0
' @entity181 is always reflective of how they can better connect with consumers			0
' an example of this is the voluntary phase - out of sow stalls of which the industry is over 65 % of the way there - this is a world first			0
' if these activists were genuine in their desire for better welfare , they would work closer with this industry shoulder - to - shoulder			0
' @entity196 stalls are used for intensive pig farming where female pigs are kept in metal enclosures during pregnancy			1
in response to mr @entity11 's claims that the footage was taken from more than 50 farms across @entity16 , the @entity201 told @entity25 that one producer is currently before the courts after footage from his farm was released in august , 2012			1
other producers have been independently inspected by appropriate authorities with the legislative power relating to animal welfare law ( @entity214 , @entity215 and in some cases by the police / stock squad ) and have been cleared of any violations of animal welfare law			0
@entity13 is showing in select cinemas around the country from october 17 to november 23 .			2
