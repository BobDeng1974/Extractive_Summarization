by @entity0 and @entity1 anguish : three more women have made allegations against @entity5			2
this week he was cleared of all charges against him and is set to return to work the husband of a key witness in the @entity5 trial says she is planning civil action against him over an alleged sex assault			1
the woman , who can not be identified , is furious at what she calls an ‘ abysmal ’ police investigation			1
the revelation came as it emerged that several new witnesses have come forward to claim they were sexually assaulted by the @entity21 actor			1
the woman testified during the trial at which @entity5 was acquitted on all charges , but claims there is evidence which the jury did not hear and she accuses police officers of failing to pursue leads			1
her husband said : ‘ we intend to instruct lawyers and will look to bring a civil action against @entity5			2
‘ my wife feels she was led up the garden path by police			2
' they promised various pieces of important evidence would be placed before the court but we never heard any of it			0
‘ instead they relied entirely on my wife and other women taking the stand			0
for instance , there was evidence relating to a gold @entity49 which she rode in			0
‘ it was said that the defendant did not have such a car at the time in question			0
' the police told us they could n’t check because @entity58 records did n’t go back to the 1960s – but surely inquiries could establish this			0
rovers return : speaking outside court following his acquittal the 81 - year - old said : ' in these situations there are no winners			1
i would like to get back to work ' ‘ why could n’t they ask questions , wear out a bit of shoe leather , instead of just relying on computer records ? my wife has been honest all the way through			0
now she ’s been on medication since before @entity78 and is completely traumatised by what has happened			0
’ sources close to the @entity5 investigation say that ‘ several ’ women have contacted police but they are unlikely to pursue new claims			1
at least three women made their allegations during the actor ’s 17 - day trial			1
it is understood they concern incidents said to have taken place in the late 1960s and the early 1970s			0
one of the women , now married and aged 64 , alleges she met the actor when she was a teenage autograph - hunter			1
@entity96 sources confirmed last night that officers had spoken to each of the new complainants			1
however , a detective said : ‘ there is no investigation , and there wo n’t be one			2
’ @entity5 ’s legal team claimed throughout the trial that he had been targeted as part of a ‘ witch - hunt ’ against celebrities			2
it is an allegation both @entity96 and the @entity110 deny			1
@entity111 , the chief prosecutor for the @entity112 , said : ‘ when the evidence passes the prosecution test it is right that a jury considers the evidence			0
when a jury delivers a verdict , no matter what it is , that is justice being done			0
