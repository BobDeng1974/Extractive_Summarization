the @entity0 said ' all necessary steps ' were being taking to protect those potentially put at risk , including the officer who shot @entity5 firearms officers and jurors have been put at risk after two computer discs containing sensitive information about them were lost in the post			1
the officer who shot @entity5 – whose killing sparked the @entity16 riots – is among those in danger of being identified following the astonishing blunder by @entity21 officials			1
security has been urgently overhauled , with police marksmen given extra protection in case of revenge attacks			1
it is the most serious data breach since 2007 when two @entity29 discs containing information on 25million people were lost in the post			1
the latest details to go missing relate to the killings of @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38			1
the @entity0 refused to discuss the nature of the lost data			1
but it said ‘ all necessary steps ’ had been taken to ensure all those potentially placed at risk were protected			1
justice secretary @entity43 has ordered an investigation into the ‘ appalling ’ breach to discover exactly how the data vanished			1
ministers said they were treating the incident ‘ extremely seriously ’ and lawyers are working frantically to establish exactly what information was stored in documents on the discs			1
two of the investigations relate to the fatal police shootings of crime suspects in @entity16 – an inquest into the death of @entity36 in 2011 and an inquiry into the death of @entity60 in 2005			1
the third is an inquest into the 1997 murder of mr @entity38 by @entity64 in @entity65 , which campaigners claim involved the collusion of the @entity68			1

' it would be disastrous if this data got into the wrong hands			2
’ the @entity0 said : ‘ there is no evidence to indicate the information loss arose from malicious intent			1
also on the disks , which ministers realised were missing on january 8 , are details of the inquiry into the shooting of @entity37 ( left ) in 2005 , and the 1997 murder of @entity94 in @entity65 ( right ) ' nevertheless , it is essential to take all necessary steps to safeguard the interests of anyone whose information could be disclosed			1
’ the @entity100 said it had performed a risk assessment and had taken ‘ appropriate steps ’			1
the loss is particularly sensitive as @entity36 ’s shooting by police led to the august 2011 riots in @entity16 – which spread across @entity107 causing five deaths and £ 200million of damage			2
the 29 - year - old , who was in the feared @entity112 gang , is said to have brandished a firearm at officers who stopped him in north @entity16			2
he then ran off and was shot twice , dying from a gunshot wound to the chest			2
police were cleared of killing him unlawfully despite the father - of - four being unarmed at the @entity121 firearms officer who shot @entity36 was given anonymity when he gave evidence to an inquest , and was known only as @entity125			2
@entity60 was shot dead in north @entity16 in 2005 in a swoop by officers who thought he and two other men were going to stage an armed heist on @entity131 drug dealers an inquiry found there was ‘ no lawful justification ’ for killing the 24 - year - old			2
all but one of the officers involved in the shooting have been granted anonymity			2
father - of - three mr @entity38 , a 25 - year - old @entity141 , died after being beaten by a @entity143 gang in @entity144 , @entity145 , in 1997			1

its report has not yet been published			0
his family said in a statement : ‘ we are asking our solicitor to seek an urgent meeting with government officials to seek answers to our concerns about this serious breach of data protection			1
’ @entity165 , of the charity inquest , said : ‘ this is an astonishing and unacceptable lapse that will further undermine public and family confidence in the way contentious deaths are dealt with			0
' it is shocking that such sensitive material can be treated with such apparent disregard , particularly considering the strict confidentiality undertakings families and their lawyers have to sign up to			0
’ data watchdog the information commissioner is examining the case			0
one victim described being targeted by a convicted abuser after @entity184 mp @entity183 outed four people who had been abused as children online child abuse victims say they have received death threats after senior @entity184 mp @entity183 published their names on a parliamentary website			0
the former europe minister was accused of an error of judgment after releasing emails containing the identities of four people abused in childhood and unfavourable comments about them			0
the row is the latest to engulf the independent child sex abuse inquiry , which has faltered amid complaints about a lack of transparency and the backgrounds of some inquiry panel members			0
victims hit out at the decision by mr @entity183 , chairman of the @entity209 , to post un-redacted emails about them on its website			0
in a letter to home secretary @entity214 , they said the blunder ‘ highlighted an astonishing lack of awareness ’			0
signed by the four ‘ outed ’ victims and 14 others who have been campaigning for changes to the inquiry , the letter said those who were named had ‘ been subjected to social media hate campaigns as a result of the disclosures and negative attitudes expressed by some panel members ’			0
it added : ‘ [ one victim ] and his young daughter have been targeted by [ a ] convicted abuser			0
’ mrs may wrote to mr @entity183 to express her ‘ dismay ’			0
the anonymity of sex abuse victims is protected by the @entity235 ( @entity236 ) 1992			0
@entity209 sources defended mr @entity183 , saying those he named had previously publicly declared themselves , one way or another , as abuse victims			0
despite this , he was reported last night to be in the process of apologising to the four			0
