by @entity1 reporter published : 23:19 est , 18 december 2012 updated : 16:35 est , 19 december 2012 three @entity3 officials , including two who oversaw security decisions at the diplomatic embassy in @entity7 , resigned under pressure wednesday , less than a day after a damning report blamed management failures for a lack of security at the @entity14 building in @entity15 where militants killed the @entity14 ambassador and three other @entity14 on sept. 11			1
@entity18 , the assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security , and @entity20 , the deputy assistant secretary responsible for embassy security , have stepped down			1
a third official , who works for the @entity24 , has also stepped down but has n't yet been identified			1
the independent investigation of the @entity7 attack said poor leadership in both bureaus left the @entity7 mission underprotected			1
it concluded that management and leadership failures in the @entity3 led to ' grossly ' poor security at the @entity14 consulate			1
the report singled out the @entity55 and the @entity24 for criticism , saying there appeared to be a lack of cooperation and confusion over protection at the mission in @entity7 , a city in @entity15 that was relatively lawless after the revolution that toppled @entity65 strongman @entity64			1
despite those failures , the @entity66 determined that no individual officials ignored or violated their duties and recommended no disciplinary action now			2
but it also said poor performance by senior managers should be grounds for disciplinary recommendations in the future			2
the report appeared to break little new ground about the timeline of the @entity7 attack during which @entity65 ambassador @entity81 , information specialist @entity82 and former @entity83 and @entity84 - who were contractors working for the @entity86 - were killed			2
burning issue : ambassador @entity81 and three other @entity14 were killed in a six - hour , commando - style attack on the consulate in @entity7 @entity81 ' slaying was the first of a @entity14 ambassador since 1988			2
but it confirmed that contrary to initial accounts , there was no protest outside the consulate and said responsibility for the incident rested entirely with the terrorists who attacked the mission			0
in the immediate aftermath of the attack , administration officials linked the attack to the spreading protests over an @entity14 - made , @entity110 film that had begun in @entity111 earlier that day			0
those comments came after evidence already pointed to a distinct militant attack			0
@entity116 ambassador @entity115 appeared on numerous tv talk shows the sunday after the attack and used the administration talking points linking it to the film			0
derailed : @entity115 appeared on numerous talk shows after the attack and used talking points linking it to the anti-islam film an ensuing brouhaha in the heat of the presidential campaign eventually led her to withdraw her name from consideration to replace @entity132 as secretary of state in president @entity135 's second term			1
the review board determined that there had been no immediate , specific tactical warning of a potential attack on the 11th anniversary of 9/11			0
however , the report said there had been several worrisome incidents in the run - up to the attack that should have set off warning bells			0
while criticizing @entity3 management in @entity148 along with the local militia force and contract guards that the mission depended on for protection , the report said @entity14 personnel on the ground in @entity7 ' performed with courage and readiness to risk their lives to protect their colleagues in a near - impossible situation			1
' it said the response by @entity55 agents on the scene and @entity86 operatives at a nearby compound that later came under attack itself had been ' timely and appropriate ' but absolved the military from any blame			0
' there was simply not enough time for armed @entity14 military assets to have made a difference			0
' the @entity3 sent a classified version of the report to lawmakers on tuesday and shortly thereafter released an unclassified version			2
the report made 29 recommendations to improve embassy security , particularly at high threat posts			1
in an accompanying letter to @entity183 , @entity181 thanked the board for its ' clear - eyed , serious look at serious systemic challenges ' and said she accepted all the recommendations			0
killed : ambassador @entity81 ( left ) died of smoke inhalation , while agent @entity82 ( right ) died in a desperate battle with insurgents heroic : former @entity83 ( left ) and @entity84 ( right ) were killed in a mortar attack some of those challenges were revealed in earlier congressional hearings when several @entity3 officials discussed competing demands for security and cost prohibitions			1
@entity181 said the department had already begun to implement some of the recommendations			0
they include increasing by several hundred the number of @entity205 guards stationed at diplomatic missions throughout the world , relying less on local security forces for protection at embassies , consulates and other offices , and increasing hiring and deployment of highly trained @entity55 agents at at - risk posts			0
members of local @entity65 militias provided some security around the consulate , but in the attack it became unclear whose side they were on			0
the report also called on @entity183 to fully fund the @entity3 's security initiative , noting that budget constraints in the past had led some management officials to emphasize savings over security despite numerous requests from the @entity7 mission and embassy in @entity233 for enhanced protection			1
inferno : armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate 's exterior siege : the compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack , which lasted several hours ' for many years the @entity3 has been engaged in a struggle to obtain the resources necessary to carry out its work with varying degrees of success , ' it said			1
this has led to efficiencies but also ' had the effect of conditioning a few @entity3 managers to favor restricting the use of resources as a general orientation			2
' it said the number of @entity55 staff in @entity7 before and on the day of the attack ' was inadequate despite repeated requests ... for additional staffing			1
' ' the solution requires a more serious and sustained commitment from @entity183 to support @entity3 needs , which , in total , constitute a small percentage of the full national budget and that spent for national security , ' it said			1
' @entity183 must do its part to meet this challenge and provide necessary resources			0
' on her way out : in a letter to lawmakers , @entity181 urged @entity183 to support the @entity3 's security requests @entity183 has denied some funding requests from the @entity3 for more security			1
in her letter to lawmakers , @entity181 urged @entity183 to support the department 's security requests , noting that ' all of us ... have a responsibility to provide the men and women serving this country with the best possible security and support			2
' retired ambassador @entity295 and a former @entity297 chairman , adm @entity296 , led the independent review , studying thousands of pages of cables and other documents , hours of video and intelligence and interviewing more than 100 people , including survivors			0
they will testify before the @entity309 and @entity310 foreign affairs committees behind closed doors on wednesday			0
on thursday , the @entity3 's two deputy secretaries , @entity313 and @entity314 , will testify in open sessions before the @entity316 and the @entity317			1
@entity181 was to have appeared at thursday 's hearing but canceled after fainting and sustaining a concussion last week while recovering from a stomach virus that dehydrated her			0
she is under doctors ' orders to rest			0
the @entity7 attack has highlighted the larger question of how @entity14 diplomats and intelligence officers can do their jobs in unstable environments , as @entity331 spreads across @entity332 , without also expanding their security			1
diplomats have said that overreacting to the attack could produce what some are calling a ' @entity7 effect ' that would wall them off from the people they are supposed to be engaging			2
in her letter to lawmakers , @entity181 said , ' we will never prevent every act of terrorism or achieve perfect security ' but she stressed that ' our diplomats can not work in bunkers			2
' ' we must accept a level of risk to protect this country we love and to advance our interests and values around the world , ' she said .			0

@entity3 officials @entity18 , responsible for diplomats security , and @entity20 , embassy security , have resigned
their decisions follow an independent panel 's finding that leadership and management were ' grossly ' inadequate at the time of the @entity7 strike
a third , as yet *unnamed* official , who works for the @entity24 has also resigned
secretary of state @entity132 said she accepts 29 recommendations by independent panel
