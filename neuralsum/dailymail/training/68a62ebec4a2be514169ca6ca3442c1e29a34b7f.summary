by @entity0 we 're a nation of scrimpers and savers when it comes to booking a holiday			0
but our preconceived ideas about expensive destinations are often misjudged , with many of us overspending despite our keenness for a bargain			0
as many as 49 per cent of @entity12 who had never been to @entity14 felt it was not a value - for - money country , according to a new survey by @entity18			1
pricey : destinations such as the @entity20 in the south of @entity14 are not seen as value for money on a budget : beaches , such as @entity26 in @entity27 , are thought to be budget options of those who had been to @entity14 , only 50 per cent thought it represented good value for money			2
based on responses from 2,085 @entity12 adults , the survey showed that of those countries in which holidays had been taken , @entity36 was seen to be the best value - for - money destination , followed by mainland @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			1
based on perception rather than actual visits , the country seen as offering the best value was @entity27 , followed by @entity36 , mainland @entity40 and @entity47			1
of countries not visited , @entity48 was bottom of the list , with only 38 per cent deeming it a good value - for - money destination			2
@entity36 was the destination to which most people would return			0
around two - thirds of people who had been before said they would go back , while 63 per cent would return to mainland @entity40			0
but - on a value - for - money basis - only 29 per cent would go back to @entity48 , only a third would return to @entity14 and only 40 per cent would make another trip to @entity61			1
@entity48 holidays are not seen as expensive with those on a budget favouring breaks in countries such as @entity36 ( @entity68 beach in @entity48 , left , and @entity69 in @entity36 , right ) the survey also showed that , on average , people set aside £ 552 in spending money while on a break but overspend by £ 242			1
also , 27 per cent chose a destination as they had found it to offer good value on a previous @entity78 , of @entity18 , said : ' our new research shows the extent to which value is a determining factor in destination choice			0
' holidaymakers can best arm themselves with information that will help them to make informed decisions about value by monitoring exchange rates to see where sterling has strengthened most this year			0

*perceived* value is the *key* to how we choose our holidays , finds a survey
@entity36 and @entity40 score but @entity14 , @entity48 and @entity61 get the *thumbs* down
only a third of us stick to our spending budget on overseas trips
on a holiday spending budget of £ 552 the average overspend is £ 242
