by @entity0 suspended perilously across a @entity3 mountain range , these brave mountaineers need a head for heights as they traverse a rope bridge which is twice as high as the @entity7			0
at a dizzying height of 2000ft the bridge on @entity9 is among the most elevated in the world , and at 350ft is the longest in @entity12			1
the bridge , dubbed the the @entity14 , links two peaks of the mountain together and forms part of @entity21 's @entity20 experience			1
it took a team of 15 to 20 workers three months to complete and is so long it is not always possible to see the other side in cloudy weather			2
@entity28 is @entity29 and the original routes consisted of a series of metal cables , rungs , ladders and bridges across the @entity36 which soldiers used to carry munitions and supplies to their allies during both @entity41			1
the route on @entity9 is the first in the @entity44			2
sky high : thrill seekers have been lining up to traverse this rope bridge on @entity9 in the @entity3 , which , at 2,000ft is twice as high as the @entity7 @entity48 for heights : mountaineer @entity50 traverses the bridge , which stretches 350ft between two mountain peaks , making it the longest in @entity12 @entity55 : the tip of @entity9 , home of the via ferrata route is 2,126ft high , compared with the @entity7 in @entity58 which measures 1,016ft scale : the bridge , dubbed the the @entity14 , links two peaks of the mountain together and forms part of @entity21 's @entity20 experience the @entity28 at @entity21 was first opened in 2007 , when a cable was positioned along the mountain face , using tracks originally used by miners to traverse the peak			1
its name meaning ' @entity72 ' in @entity29 , via ferrata routes consist of rungs , cables , ladders and bridges positioned into mountain ranges and were originally used by soldiers during both @entity41 as a means of getting across the @entity36 and the @entity81			1
at the outbreak of the @entity83 the @entity81 were part of @entity85 , and fierce battles were fought between @entity87 , part of the alliance , and @entity85 in the mountain range , with both sides trying to gain control of the peaks where observation stations and guns could be positioned			2
trenches , dugouts and other relics of the @entity83 can still be found alongside many via ferratas in the @entity101			0
today via ferrata routes remain popular with climbers , particularly in @entity87 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 , as they enable thrill seekers to climb technical rock faces without the need for a large amount of training and with only minimal amounts of equipment - such as helmets and harnesses			0
the @entity3 route was the @entity44 's first , but has not been without controversy			0
plans to make the route larger by including a 1.2km zip wire were blocked by @entity3 planners in 2011 , and a revised plan rejected in january 2013			0
opponents argued against it on environmental grounds and said the proposed zip wire was too close to a walking route from the @entity130 pass to @entity131 , @entity124 's favourite fell			0
@entity3 mountaineer sir @entity132 , who supported the expansion scheme , quit his role as @entity135 of the @entity3 after the group opposed the extension , which was originally proposed by the late mine owner , @entity138 , who was killed in a helicopter crash in march 2011			0
iron way : @entity28 is @entity29 and the original routes consisted of a series of metal cables , rungs , ladders and bridges across the @entity36 purpose : on the original via ferrata routes a series of metal cables , rungs , ladders and bridges were installed on the mountains to help soldiers ascend and descend treacherous climbing routes across the @entity36 area : the bridge cuts through the picturesque surroundings of the @entity130 pass , home to the @entity162 slate mine and often dubbed the wettest place in @entity164 history : the bridge links two peaks of @entity168 , the side of which has been commercially quarried for its high - quality green slate since the 1750s			1
@entity173 mining and quarrying at @entity130 did stop in 1986 , but restarted in february 1997 safety first : all visitors to the via ferrata are given safety equipment including a helmet and harness and are accompanied on their journey by a guide popular : via ferrata is popular among many thrill seekers because it does not require a huge amount of training , and enables climbers to reach elevated peaks they might otherwise not be able to controversy : plans to make the via ferrata route larger by including a 1.2km zip wire were blocked by @entity3 planners in 2011 , and a revised plan rejected in january 2013			2

bridge linking two peaks of @entity9 in @entity198 is among the highest in the world and the longest in @entity12
it forms part of a @entity28 route and took a team of workers three months to complete
@entity28 is @entity29 , and describes routes used by soldiers to cross the @entity36 during both @entity41
