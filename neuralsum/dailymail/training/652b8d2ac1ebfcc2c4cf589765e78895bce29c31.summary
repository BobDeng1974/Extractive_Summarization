a teenage punk has been charged with supplying a dangerous batch of ' @entity3 ' ecstasy drugs , believed to have claimed the lives of four men			1
@entity6 , 19 , from @entity7 in @entity8 has been remanded in custody and will appear before magistrates tomorrow to face counts of supplying the drug and possession with intent to supply			1
a 20 - year - old man and a 26 - year - old man from @entity7 were also arrested on suspicion of supplying the drugs but have been released on bail while police continue their investigation			1
labourer , @entity22 , 20 , ( left ) died after taking the drug on @entity23 while @entity25 factory worker , @entity24 , was found dead on christmas eve at the house he shares with friends in @entity7 the arrest comes after the deaths of three men from @entity8 were linked to the rogue batch of pills , as well as a fourth man from @entity34			1
a fifth man was taken to hospital on @entity38 and is making a recovery , @entity35 added			0
the first victim , 22 - year - old @entity25 factory worker @entity24 , who was also known as @entity42 , collapsed and died at his home in @entity7 on christmas eve			2
police are linking his death with that of @entity47 , 24 , also from @entity7 , who died on @entity38			1
the reddish tablets are embossed with an 's ' superman logo and come in either a round or triangular shape they are investigating the possibility the pair 's death is linked to that of @entity22 , a 20 - year - old labourer from @entity57 in @entity8 - who also died on @entity38			2
the death of @entity60 , 27 , from @entity61 in @entity34 - the only one outside of @entity8 - who died hours after mr @entity22 , is also believed to have been connected			1
all are believed to have taken one or more of a deadly batch of triangular red pills embossed with the @entity3 's ' logo			2
@entity35 took the unprecedented move of offering an amnesty to anyone who handed in the tablets , in a desperate attempt to get them off the streets			0
police believe the deaths of the three men in @entity7 may be linked after they were called to three addresses across the town in the space of one week ( pictured ) officers said the drugs are similar to some found in the @entity83 which contained a very high amount of the substance pmma			1
this gives the pills a delayed effect and users often overdose accidentally because they think the drug is not working , leading to a fatal rise in body temperature			0
chief inspector @entity94 said : ' as well as it being illegal to sell and buy drugs , it can also be very dangerous as we have sadly seen with these tragic deaths			0
the pills are described as red and triangular with a @entity3 logo printed on them ( pictured ) ' we would urge everyone not to be tempted to take illegal drugs - you do n't know where they have come from , what they are made up of , or how your body will react to them			0
' if you have been offered drugs in the @entity7 area over the past few weeks , in particular ecstasy , we 'd urge you to contact us with any information so that we can find those responsible and remove these dangerous drugs from the streets			1
' meanwhile , @entity35 said a man arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly in @entity7 town centre earlier today became unwell and told officers he had taken a ' @entity3 ' pill			2
he was taken to @entity126 but has since been discharged			0
chief superintendent @entity127 said : ' it is concerning that we have another report of a member of the public requiring medical treatment after taking a pill of the same description already under investigation			0
' i would like to re-emphasise the messages we have given out so far - if anyone is in possession of these distinctive looking pills , please do not take them or pass them on , please hand them in to police or one of the other agencies listed			0
' our number one priority is to remove these drugs from our communities and prevent any further harm			0
