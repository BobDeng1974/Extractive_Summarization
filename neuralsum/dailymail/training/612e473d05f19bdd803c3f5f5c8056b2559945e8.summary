@entity1 stabbed @entity15 , 20 , before murdering @entity16 , also 20 , after participating in a threesome with the pair			1
the 32 - year - old killer even updated his @entity21 status from his hiding place during the early hours of august 10 last year as police searched for clues into the violent deaths of his co-workers , writing : ' i 'd like to wake up from this nightmare			1
' a jury at the @entity30 heard how performing arts student @entity31 , who had only worked at the hotel as a receptionist for three weeks , was found fully - clothed lying on the floor of @entity1 's staff quarters at the @entity36 at @entity37 , with a cushion over her face like ' a discarded rag doll '			2
she had been stabbed 22 times on the front and back of her body , penetrating her heart , left lung , spleen , stomach and diaphragm			0
@entity50 - born @entity1 had stabbed mr @entity15 twice in the heart and carried his body to a double bed after cutting off the dead man 's t - shirt and boxer shorts , leaving him naked			1
the court was told that openly gay @entity1 had an unrequited crush on fellow @entity50 mr @entity15 , becoming agitated in the days before the killings after mr @entity15 won a place at a university back in @entity50			1
@entity1 had been jealous about mr @entity15 â€™s relationships , and just days before the killing launched an outburst at his victim during a team building exercise when he took a picture that did not feature @entity1 , the court heard			1
the divan bed where @entity1 ( right ) dumped @entity70 's body and hid from police for two days the court heard it was the sight of the pair kissing that drove @entity1 to murder after the group had played drinking games , took poppers - a well - known sexual stimulant - and toyed with the idea of group sex			1
colleagues discovered the bloodied scene when the three receptionists failed to turn up for work the next morning , summoning police to the flat in @entity86 , @entity87			0
detectives combed the sealed - off quarters for clues but did not discover @entity1 , who was named as the hotel 's employee of the year in 2010 , until the second day of their investigations			2
he was lying on another double bed after attempting to take his own life			0
he had tried to slit his wrists with modelling knives and electrocute himself with a hairdryer in the bath			0
officers found that @entity1 had water and his mobile phone with him and had cut a slit in the divan bed that he hid in so he could observe the investigation			2
@entity15 was due to return to @entity50 to attend university , while @entity16 studied performing arts ' so throughout the time of those that had been in the flat dealing with the investigation and removing the bodies , it appears @entity1 was concealed under the bed , no doubt able to hear everything that was said and sufficient presence of mind to keep himself concealed despite all that that was going on around him in that flat at the time			1

he said : ' i have looked back at this several times with senior management			0
it was such a strange and bizarre thing for a person to do			0
' he said crime - scene examiners would lose crucial forensic evidence if they lifted up beds looking for people who were not there			0
mr @entity133 added : ' i would not want anyone to do anything differently in the future			0

@entity1 stabbed @entity15 , 20 , and @entity16
