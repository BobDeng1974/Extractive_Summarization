by @entity0 published : 02:51 est , 9 august 2013 updated : 04:27 est , 9 august 2013 one piece of @entity2 that @entity3 will probably not be adding to his famous collection is a new sculpture of the multi-millionaire himself			1
the larger - than - life work depicts the man who discovered @entity11 and @entity12 standing upright with a blood - red face , devil ’s horns and an outstretched , moveable arm and grasping fingers which are clearly in @entity19 strangulation mode			1
the 6ft 7in mannequin is entitled ‘ @entity21 ’ , a reference to how @entity23 described the infamous incident at @entity25 , @entity26 , which ended with his accepting a police caution for assault and a quickie divorce			1
controversial : ' playful tiff ' is a sculpture by an anonymous artist in @entity35 's @entity34 which shows @entity3 as the devil and allows members of the public to be strangled by him gallery : the 6ft 7in mannequin is entitled ‘ @entity21 ’ , a reference to how @entity23 described the infamous incident at @entity25 , @entity26 - and this sign accompanies the artwork up until last week , the fearsome figure took pride of place at the appropriately - named @entity34 in the chattering classes ’ enclave of @entity48 , @entity35 — locals include the new @entity51 actor @entity50			1
intrigued art lovers were invited to interact with the installation and take a photograph of themselves being strangled by the flexible hand			1
and according to the gallery director , @entity57 , many visitors did just that			1
‘ it is a very imposing , scary figure			1
it caused a huge amount of interest , ” she says			2
the sculpture came with a printed notice saying : ‘ please note this is not @entity3			1
please feel free to take a picture of yourself being strangled by not @entity3			1
’ mocked : intrigued art lovers were invited to interact with the installation and take a photograph of themselves being strangled by the flexible hand which is proving a big hit with visitors ‘ everyone who came thought it was hilarious and they all wanted to be strangled by him			1
‘ but actually it is a very serious , thought - provoking piece , ’ @entity57 assures me			1
ironically the scuplture is made from a shop dummy and the £ 12 million marital home which @entity19 and @entity3 previously shared in @entity80 was the converted showroom of renowned mannequin maker @entity82			1
a new piece of work depicts @entity3 standing upright with a blood - red face , devil 's horns and an outstretched , moveable arm and grasping fingers which are clearly in @entity19 strangulation mode the gallery , however , is refusing to name the artist because he or she wishes to remain anonymous			1
‘ it was left on our doorstep and was on show for ten days and then it was collected by courier			2
‘ the artist is remaining anonymous for obvious reasons			2
after all @entity3 is the most powerful and influential art collector in the country			1
‘ it ’s a bit like @entity103 — nobody knows who he is either			2
’ shadow home secretary @entity106 has just declared an impressive £ 30,516 in donations to help finance the running of her private office			2
this includes a gift of £ 16,459 from @entity113 mp @entity112 , wife of multi-millionaire @entity115 luvvie and thriller writer @entity117			2
@entity119 ’s arch - rival for a possible @entity115 leadership battle @entity121 has raised only £ 20,000 — all from coral bookmaker boss @entity122			1
so is ambitious ms @entity106 — wife of shadow chancellor @entity124 — pulling ahead of @entity121 in the leadership stakes ? on this showing the odds certainly seem to favour her			2
sheherazade has gone into business with her pal , model @entity130 , designing gold jewellery while millionaire mp @entity137 and his second wife @entity138 are cooing over @entity139 , their new baby — his third child and her first — his ex-wife @entity128 has been busy with a production of her own			2
@entity141 has been heard of stunning @entity128 , 39 , since she divorced @entity137 three years ago thanks to his adultery with lissom @entity145 heiress @entity143			2
now , i discover , she has gone into business with her pal , model @entity130 , designing gold jewellery			2
clients of their new @entity154 online company can purchase heart - shaped lockets made of crystal and 18 - carat gold which , the pair explain , are ‘ designed to be worn close to the heart like a talisman ’			1
the idea is that you then fill them with tiny meaningful charms			2
@entity128 — the daughter of @entity165 - born socialite @entity164 and her ex-love , feared @entity168 asset - stripper @entity167 — says she got the idea from her ten - year - old son , @entity170 , after he came home from a funfair with a plastic heart on a necklace			1
her efforts , of course , are somewhat more elaborate — she sells the baubles for between £ 400 and £ 550 each , plus you need a chain to hang them on , which can cost up to £ 2,000			2
sounds like an ideal christening present for @entity137 ’s little girl			0
