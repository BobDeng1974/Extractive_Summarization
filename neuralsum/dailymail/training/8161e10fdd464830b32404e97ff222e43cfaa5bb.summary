by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:01 est , 1 february 2013 updated : 08:21 est , 1 february 2013 the @entity3 djs who made a prank call to the @entity6 's hospital will not face any charges despite the apparent suicide of the nurse who took the call			1
the @entity11 said there was no evidence to support a manslaughter charge against @entity15 and @entity16 , who posed as the @entity17 and @entity18 to call the @entity20 's hospital in central @entity21 when @entity6 was being treated for a rare form of pregnancy sickness			1
nurse @entity24 , who transferred them to a colleague who then described @entity6 's condition in detail , was found hanged a few days after the incident			2
following a global backlash against the two hoaxers the case was investigated but @entity35 , deputy head of special crime at the @entity11 , said any potential prosecution would not be in the public interest			0
no charges will be brought against @entity3 djs @entity15 and @entity16 over hoax calls to the hospital treating the @entity6 , the @entity11 said today he said : ' as is well known , on december 4 2012 @entity15 and @entity16 , both radio presenters in @entity3 , made a telephone call to the @entity45 in @entity21 , where the @entity6 was receiving treatment , in which they pretended to be members of the @entity49			1
' during the course of the call , private information about the @entity6 's health was given , in good faith , to ms @entity55 and mr @entity16 and the call was later played on a radio station in @entity3			1
' subsequently , @entity24 , a nurse at the hospital who had initially taken the call but who had not herself passed on the information , tragically took her own life			0
' he said @entity65 provided the @entity11 with a file of evidence on december 19 and asked advice on whether a prosecution should be brought			0
tragic : @entity24 , 46 , of @entity70 , the nurse who transferred the call to @entity6 's ward , was found dead in nurses ' housing three days after the call ' having carefully reviewed the evidence currently available , we have concluded that there is no evidence to support a charge of manslaughter and that , although there is some evidence to warrant further investigation of offences under the @entity92 , the @entity79 and the @entity80 , no further investigation is required because any potential prosecution would not be in the public interest , ' he said			2
mr @entity35 said the @entity11 had taken into account , among other matters , that it is not possible to extradite people from @entity3 on the potential offences in question			2
he also said it considered that ' however misguided , the telephone call was intended as a harmless prank '			0
' the consequences in this case were very sad			0
we send our sincere condolences to @entity24 's family			0
' the @entity3 was this week permanently taken off air this week - but the two presenters will be given other roles at the station			1
@entity15 and @entity16 of @entity113 in @entity114 went into hiding and received death threats following the phone call last month to @entity118 in @entity119 , central @entity21			1
their @entity121 show has been axed , but the presenters are still employed - and network @entity123 is looking at them ‘ returning to work when the time is right , in roles that make full use of their talents ’			1
@entity24 , 46 , of @entity70 , the nurse who transferred the call to @entity6 ’s ward , was found dead in nurses ’ housing three days later , prompting a huge backlash against @entity55 and mr @entity16			2
@entity123 is today launching a new programme called @entity136 , in place of @entity121 , which will be hosted by presenter @entity138 , but miss @entity55 and mr @entity16 are still on leave			1
‘ we look forward to @entity15 and @entity143 returning to work when the time is right , in roles that make full use of their talents , ’ @entity123 chief executive @entity140 told @entity141			1
he added that the network will discuss future roles with the presenters ‘ when they are ready ’			2
miss @entity55 and mr @entity16 posed as the @entity17 and prince @entity18 in the call , which led @entity123 to suspend prank calls by all of its radio stations and saw both presenters make a tearful apology on tv for their actions			1
ms @entity161 's grieving husband and two teenage children clutched each other last month as they gathered with hundreds of mourners in a small town in @entity165 for her funeral			0
@entity167 and @entity6 pictured leaving the king edward vii hospital shortly after she received treatment for morning sickness miss @entity55 said in an interview after the death : ' there ’s not a minute that goes by that we do n’t think about her family and what they must be going through			0
' the @entity180 spoke of their grief soon after the prank call saying they were ' gutted , shattered and heartbroken '			0
in two emotional and often tearful interviews , @entity15 and @entity16 offered their apologies to the family of @entity24 , but insisted that it had been a ' harmless prank ' and that no one could have foreseen the tragedy			1
recounting the phone call in which another member of staff broke the news about the nurse 's death , sobbing @entity55 , 30 , said : ' i remember my first question was , “ was she a mother ? ” ... it was the worst phone call i have ever had in my life			0
' there 's not a minute that goes by that we do n't think about her family and what they must be going through			0
and the thought we may have played a part in that is gut - wrenching			0
' mr @entity16 , 25 , who had joined the @entity114 - based radio station only weeks earlier , said : ' our deepest sympathies are with the family and friends of all those affected			2
obviously @entity15 and myself are incredibly sorry for the situation and what 's happened			1
' we hope that they [ mrs @entity161 's family ] are doing ok and they 're getting the love and support that they deserve and need right now			0
' mr @entity16 and @entity55 were also believed to have been given bodyguards following the backlash to their prank .			2

@entity3 @entity15 and @entity16 are still employed by network
but their @entity121 show has been permanently cut from @entity113 's *schedule*
bosses want them to return ' in roles that make use of their talents '
