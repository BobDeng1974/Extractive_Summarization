when @entity1 completed his four - month move to @entity3 on monday , it took the number of @entity6 players on loan at different clubs around the world to 22 , the equivalent of two teams			1
still they had not finished			0
@entity14 was later loaned to @entity15 in @entity17 ’s second tier , @entity13 negotiated another to @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 went to @entity23 team @entity22 and @entity24 headed to @entity25 that moved it on to 26 , and still there was mystery around the future of @entity31 , who has lost his place after a decade in the team			1
’ as the deadline approached on monday , however , he was starting to look like a stayer			0
earlier in the day , @entity33 , signed last year for £ 8million from @entity57 , moved for a year on loan to @entity37 , where he will join @entity43			2
@entity6 this season will have around £ 100m worth of signings scattered around the world on loan , a figure distorted by @entity43 who is responsible for half of it after he agreed a switch to @entity37 for the final two years of his contract			0
limited opportunities : @entity80 , pictured in action against @entity83 last season , has barely played for @entity6 settling in : @entity6 midfielder @entity33 completes his medical ahead of joining @entity37 on loan off to @entity86 : @entity87 ( right ) has joined @entity88 international : @entity89 ( left ) played for @entity90 at the @entity91 but ca n't get a game at @entity6 another hazard : @entity95 's brother @entity94 ( left ) is continuing to develop at @entity96 of the others , several were recruited as teenagers for seven - figure fees and are now generating profits for the club from substantial loan fees , which all helps balance the books in the money - sensitive era of @entity107 ’s @entity106			2
@entity6 always argue that player development is the driving force behind the loan policy — and it is true that @entity112 has little faith in the current reserve and under 21 environment to produce and improve players fit for the top end of the @entity40 — but there is financial appeal , too			2
it has been a strong year for the number crunchers at @entity54 with profits banked on @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 , which have funded @entity112 ’s rebuilding programme			0
waiting in the wings : @entity129 has had to move to @entity130 for a chance change of scenery : @entity133 has switched to @entity134 plenty keeping him out : @entity21 ( right ) has gone to @entity135 - @entity22 exactly how good the policy is for the well - being of the young players in question — or those from the club ’s academy who find their paths blocked by teenage signings — is another matter but they are not breaking any rules , and @entity6 ’s long - term aim is to reduce their overall squad of players			1
today , with the market closed , they are the most extreme example but @entity155 are also in double figures for players out on loan			0
for those who failed to find a move on monday night , the @entity160 ’s ‘ emergency ’ loan window will be open for business next week .			1

@entity6 have 26 players loaned out across the globe
@entity1 joined @entity3 on transfer deadline day for four months
@entity14 , @entity13 , @entity21 and @entity24 also moved
@entity160 ’s ‘ emergency ’ loan window will be open next week
