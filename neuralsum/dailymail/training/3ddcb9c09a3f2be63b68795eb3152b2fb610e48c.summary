by @entity0 published : 04:42 est , 17 july 2012 updated : 10:48 est , 17 july 2012 we 've all been guilty of the occasional spot of pet - pampering : a catnip mouse here and a squeaky bone there			0
but one teenager from @entity9 , @entity10 , has taken doggy decadence to a whole new level , splashing out £ 1000 on birthday presents and a party when her beloved @entity15 turned three			1
and that 's just a drop in the ocean when you consider @entity15 already has a collection of clothes worth £ 20,000			1
speaking to @entity36 , miss @entity29 revealed that @entity15 's favourite outfit is her purple @entity27 hoodie , which she likes to wear around the house , and that she only wears her dresses - including a handmade one costing £ 500 - when she goes out			1
@entity15 even shares a huge , custom - built double wardrobe with miss @entity29 , who admits she has spent over £ 15,000 of her own money on treats for her treasured dog , £ 20,000 when she includes gifts the pair has been given			1
some of @entity15 's priciest items include a £ 735 @entity50 dog carrier , a £ 375 @entity52 collar and lead , a £ 110 cashmere jumper , an £ 80 bottle of dog - friendly perfume and two @entity59 dog bowls costing £ 50 each			1
@entity61 's most pampered pet : three - year - old @entity15 has a wardrobe to rival her owner @entity63 's own miss @entity29 says @entity15 's best - loved clothes label is @entity65 , a company who make ' pretty little human - style clothes that you would never expect to see on dogs ' , costing around £ 50 per piece			1
she said : ' it all started because @entity15 is very small and feels the cold quite badly , but when i put her in doggy jumpers i realised they were all really bad quality			2
' so i bought her a few nice pieces and it has now become a bit of an addiction			0
she absolutely has more clothes than me ! ' @entity82 : @entity15 has a £ 20,000 wardrobe but tends to wear relaxed jumpers around the house and save party dresses for special occasions @entity15 , who turned three on july 7 , was treated to £ 800 of gifts , including a £ 180 handbag and a pink life - jacket , even thought she has never been swimming			1
miss @entity29 said : ' i also threw her a party with four dogs and 20 people , but it was n't a massive one - it only cost about £ 200			0
' we played games and had a human cake but with no chocolate in it so that the dogs could eat it , because dogs are allergic to chocolate			0
' in the dog house : @entity29 , 17 , admits that furnishing her little dog @entity15 's very big wardrobe has become a bit of an addiction miss @entity29 , who lives at home with her parents , leaves @entity15 at home with her mother while she goes to work at her father 's company			2
she said : ' i have taken her in to work a couple of times but mostly she stays with my mum			0
eventually i 'd like to have my own dog clothing company and i 'm learning to sew so i can make clothes myself			0
' i know the money i have spent on @entity15 's clothes is pretty extortionate , and i definitely spend more on her than i do on myself			2
' her £ 500 handmade dress was the most extravagant thing i 've ever bought for her , but she also has little teddy bears which she loves that are n't so expensive			1
and her @entity82 toy bone			0
' next i 'd like to get her a @entity50 collar			2
' it 's a dog 's life : @entity29 originally began buying clothes for @entity15 because the small @entity24 tends to feel the cold tremendously dog - lover @entity134 says she would never make @entity15 wear anything she was uncomfortable in , saying : ' i know she likes being dressed up because whenever i open her wardrobe she gets really excited and wags her tail			1
' some people say dogs do n't like being carried around in bags which is why i put the video of her getting into one of hers on @entity145 - to show people that she really likes being in it			0
' it 's not her most expensive bag , though , it was just £ 50			0
she has some bags which cost £ 150			0
" when miss @entity29 is not busy shopping for @entity15 or dressing her up , the teenager donates her time and money to her local dog 's home , the @entity158			2
@entity159 : @entity29 says @entity15 loves wearing her clothes as she gets excited and wags her tail whenever her £ 20,000 wardrobe is opened @entity163 's little helper : @entity15 enjoys getting dressed up for special occasions , including at @entity166 and at her £ 200 birthday party in july all dressed up : @entity15 loves designer clothes but is partial to a bit of fancy dress , too @entity171 getting into her bag , ready to hit the town :			1
