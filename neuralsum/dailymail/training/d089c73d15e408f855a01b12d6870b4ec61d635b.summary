@entity0 can expose @entity1 ‘ he was thinking about his next @entity3 pose ’ was how one @entity5 match report described @entity7 ’ error that led to @entity9 ’s winner on saturday			1
the @entity10 has been accused of letting the showbusiness replace the real business on the pitch during recent seasons			0
@entity0 will lead the charge down @entity17 ’s left			1
he does not have the raw speed of @entity19 , who will zoom down the right , but the @entity21 has more than enough in his locker to take advantage of any lapses @entity7 may have			0
@entity0 celebrates after firing @entity17 further ahead in saturday 's 5 - 0 win over @entity26 @entity7 ( right ) , in action against @entity9 at the weekend , will have a tough job marking @entity0 on tuesday @entity29 can leave @entity31 trailing coach @entity32 saw enough during the @entity33 to be reminded of just how good a midfielder @entity31 is			1
but needs must at @entity36 and with @entity37 still injured , the @entity35 still finds himself at centre - back			1
his aerial limitations are obvious , while he can be too cavalier in his tackling			0
@entity29 will know his compatriot ’s game inside out and the worry for @entity36 is that @entity29 has just started to find his rhythm ; he has the appetite to do to @entity36 what he did to @entity49 in november			1
@entity29 , scoring against @entity49 in the group stages , will be a huge threat to @entity36 @entity52 is off the boil for a player of his enormous talent , @entity52 does n’t score enough			1
and a startling statistic is that he has no goals or assists in @entity59 so far this campaign			2
with @entity62 in decline he needed to take control of @entity36 ’s midfield			2
so far he has n’t			0
@entity17 , however , will be wary			2
@entity52 provided the glorious pass that led to the penalty in the corresponding game next season			0
with @entity71 unavailable , @entity69 and @entity70 will have to keep their wits about them			0
@entity52 , before @entity36 training at the @entity76 on monday , has bee out of form recently the keeper is rusty @entity36 ’s @entity81 keeper @entity80 was signed by @entity36 ’s sporting director @entity82 to replace @entity83			2
he is excellent with his feet , great at making one on one saves and commands his area well , but there is a problem : @entity80 only plays cup games because @entity32 favours @entity91 @entity90			0
should @entity92 get on the ball frequently , @entity17 could have plenty of opportunities to test how rusty @entity80 is			2
@entity36 ’s @entity81 keeper @entity80 is only usually played in up games and could be rusty @entity97 can win the tactical battle @entity32 is condemned to be forever compared unfavourably with @entity99			1
they both played for @entity36 and both coached the youth side before the first team			1
for many , the similarities stop there			0
@entity99 ’s ability to change games mid-match does not seem to be a quality @entity32 possesses			0
after going 1 - 0 down against @entity9 he made three changes but the substitutions seemed to confuse @entity36 more than their opponents			1
@entity17 will hope to exploit this			0
@entity17 manager @entity97 ( right ) is set for a pivotal night in his club management career			1

@entity17 welcome @entity59 club @entity36 to the @entity116 on tuesday
@entity36 beat @entity97 's side 4 - 1 on *aggregate* last season
@entity17 beat @entity26 5 - 0 on saturday as @entity36 lost 1 - 0 to @entity9
