the days of soft old @entity0 not liking it up ' em when they get north of @entity4 are long gone			1
a first - half strike by the outstanding @entity6 was enough to see off @entity7 at an intimidating @entity8 and record an eighth win in a row by @entity12 's side , the best run since @entity15 team managed it in 2004			1
@entity0 have won at @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and now @entity7 , and picked up points at @entity20 and @entity21 , besides beating @entity22 in the @entity23 at @entity24			1
the only exception was a 3 - 2 defeat at @entity27 and even then they nearly clawed back a 3 - 0 deficit			1
@entity6 ( right ) fires @entity0 into a 1 - 0 lead in the 12th minute as @entity12 's side fly out of the traps at @entity8 the @entity33 midfielder points to the sky as he celebrates putting @entity0 into a early 1 - 0 lead @entity36 ( left ) celebrates @entity6 's opening goal in front of a disappointing @entity7 crowd @entity6 is congratulated by @entity0 team - mates @entity41 ( left ) and @entity42 after his early goal @entity6 's goal gave the @entity45 a perfect start , but @entity12 's side did n't have it all their own way at @entity8 @entity7 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity48 6 ; @entity49 7 , @entity50 5.5 , @entity51 6 , @entity52 6 ; @entity53 6 , @entity54 6 ( @entity55 90 ) , @entity56 5.5 ; @entity57 6 , @entity58 5.5 , @entity59 6.5 subs not used : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 booked : @entity50 , @entity52 manager : @entity68 @entity0 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity69 7 ; @entity42 6.5 , @entity70 6.5 , @entity71 6.5 , @entity72 7 ; @entity36 6.5 , @entity73 6 ; @entity6 8.5 , @entity74 6.5 , @entity75 6.5 ( @entity76 90 ) ; @entity41 6 ( @entity77 82 ) subs not used : @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 goals : @entity6 12 ' manager : @entity12 referee : @entity87 ( @entity88 ) att : @entity90 @entity91 : @entity6 * @entity93 ratings by @entity94 at @entity8 @entity6 gave @entity0 an early 1 - 0 lead			1
click here to see more from our brilliant @entity98 service the new - found resolution , built on a base of @entity71 and @entity70 at the back and @entity36 holding in midfield , has enabled @entity0 to mount a surprising late run for the title			1
it is still unlikely given @entity107 are four points ahead and hold two games in hand			1
but should @entity112 's men slip up in the first of them on sunday at @entity114 , @entity0 will be waiting			2
after next weekend 's @entity23 semi-final against @entity116 at @entity117 , the @entity45 host @entity107 at the @entity118			1
@entity12 seemed as pleased with his side 's narrow win in @entity121 as he had done after dismantling @entity20 4 - 1 at the @entity118 the previous weekend			2
' it was more of a fighting performance and many people question us on that side of things so i am pleased , ' said the @entity0 manager , whose side also had to contend with a swirling wind in the first half			2
' @entity36 contributes to the balance of the team			2
he can do things that other players are n't able to			0
' @entity7 's @entity49 ( left ) was unable to pull his side level with a 25 - yard free - kick shortly after @entity6 's goal @entity75 looks confused after a decision from referee @entity87 as the @entity141 star believes he was fouled @entity74 is surrounded by three @entity7 players as the @entity144 star attacks inside @entity7 's half to pip his old enemy @entity112 , @entity12 knows his side must equal the winning run of his last legendary title - winning team , and then go beyond it			1
' we need a perfect run and we a need a non-perfect run from @entity107			2
we can not master that , only our attitude			0
' we have won 15 of the last 17 games so we are consistent			0
we want to keep winning of course			0
it is a challenge for the team			0
' an early goal always helps and @entity0 went ahead after 12 minutes			1
@entity74 's shot was saved by @entity48 , @entity75 's rebound hit @entity50 in the face and at the third time of asking @entity6 fired into the roof of the net for his ninth goal of the season			2
' an awful goal to concede , ' said @entity68 , whose side are still in the bottom three but not without hope of beating the drop			0
@entity6 was the outsanding performer of the first half appearing to have almost limitless energy			2
one passage of play summed it up , one moment he was in the @entity0 wall blocking a @entity54 free - kick , the next he was in the @entity7 penalty area ready to try and score a second			1
@entity7 clearly tried to rough @entity0 up a bit			1
@entity185 and @entity50 were booked , @entity57 sent @entity42 flying in the air			0
the home fans thought referee @entity87 was being a bit soft towards the visitors but @entity12 clearly did n't bear @entity7 grudges , saying afterwards he hoped the @entity7 would stay up			2
gunners midfielder @entity73 ( left ) is beaten by @entity7 's @entity192 during the first 45 minutes @entity59 and @entity71 take a tumble as the two sides battled it out on saturday afternoon four thousand @entity0 fans were enjoying themselves and even had the temerity to sing “ this is a library ” as the normally voiceferous home support were stunned into temporarily silence			1
@entity0 's traditional soft - centre has hardened up too			1
@entity71 went crashing into @entity57 when danger threatened though the @entity202 was relieved to see @entity69 dive to his right to beat away @entity49 's free - kick			0
@entity7 left - back @entity185 then became the game 's first booking when he pushed his hand into @entity6 's face to stop the rampant @entity210			1
@entity211 then was close to scoring on his 100th @entity213 appearance when he went close with a trademark free - kick			1
among the watching spectators was @entity216 though with @entity0 not having a single @entity217 in their starting line - up , one hopes he made the journey north to check on @entity7 's @entity220 under - 21 striker @entity58			1
@entity0 ended the first half in control			2
@entity7 's repeated fouling gave them a flurry of free - kicks and though the home crowd berated @entity87 , it was difficult to see what else the official could have done			1
@entity0 boss @entity12 looks on from the @entity7 dugout as his team struggled to build on their 1 - 0 lead @entity58 goes close with an acrobatic effort which was easily saved by @entity0 goalkeeper @entity234 @entity57 has a shot as @entity73 looks to block during a rare sight at goal for the @entity7 striker if @entity6 was the key man of the first half , @entity36 impressed in the second as @entity7 belatedly chased an equaliser			1
he broke up most things but on the rare occasions he was breached , @entity7 fluffed their lines in front of goal			0
@entity245 international @entity56 , who scored a famous winner against @entity18 last month , miskicked when a cross from @entity185 from the left found him in front of goal			0
@entity220 under - 21 international @entity58 then connected with an overhead kick that was saved by @entity234 with his bright orange kit in goal			0
at least the @entity58 effort was something for @entity220 manager @entity216 to note down			0
he 'd travelled to @entity121 to find @entity0 had n't included a single @entity217 in their starting line - up and @entity77 was only given eight minutes at the end @entity234 also saved from @entity57 while @entity77 missed a late chance to add to @entity0 's win when he shot wide from @entity74 's pass			2
@entity50 challenges @entity45 frontman @entity41 in the air as @entity0 look to double their early advantage @entity7 manager @entity68 shouts instructions to his players during the @entity213 clash @entity202 forward @entity41 holds off a challenge from @entity56 as @entity0 look to hold onto their 1 - 0 lead ' we had moments but you have to take the moments at this level			1
it is something we have found all season , ' said @entity68 , who had some consolation by defeats earlier in the day for relegation rivals @entity278 and @entity16			0
@entity7 have six matches left and among their fixtures are games against fellow strugglers @entity284 , @entity278 and @entity285			1
' in the second half we got on the front foot , went right after them			0
and apart from the goal we conceded , i thought we defended really well			0
' there was n't a lot in the game and it was close against @entity18 and @entity107 too			2
@entity12 would have spoken to his players about what to expect here			0
' make no mistake , they have a fine side			0
they are bringing on a @entity77 as a £ 16million substitute , that 's not bad			0
' now we have got six different kinds of games left , edgy games			0
there is a less expectation on us than other teams around us so we can play with a bit more freedom			0
there is a lot of belief from us going into those games			0
we want to be effective enough to win them			0
