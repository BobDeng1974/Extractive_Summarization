' the illness forced the @entity12 to miss several key events of the @entity37 celebrations , including a service of thanksgiving at @entity40 and the concert outside @entity7			1
the @entity42 and @entity43 visited the @entity12 with their children @entity45 and @entity46 yesterday			0
after their 25 - minute visit , @entity47 said his father was feeling ' much better ' and appeared to be making a good recovery he added that the @entity12 had watched the thanksgiving service at @entity40 ’s on television			1
‘ he ’s feeling a lot better , he just needs some rest , ’ he added			2
he said the @entity0 was ‘ bearing up ’ but added : ‘ she ’s missing him , obviously			0
’ @entity47 ’s wife , @entity43 , said the @entity12 was ‘ naturally upset ’ to miss the celebrations but added : ‘ he ’s on good form			0
he is in good spirits			0
’ the @entity0 and prince @entity1 endured four hours in the wind and rain onboard the @entity65 during the @entity66 on june 3 although bladder infections are quite common in men of prince @entity1 ’s age , doctors are monitoring him closely , not least because he had heart surgery less than six months ago			1
the @entity0 has continued with her public jubilee duties stoically despite her husband 's ill health but is being regularly updated on his condition			1
asked how his mother was coping , @entity47 replied : ' she is bearing up but missing him , obviously			0
thank you very much for your concern			0
' queen is all smiles as she arrives at @entity83 lunch after news prince @entity1 is feeling better , while yesterday her concern showed during @entity87 service prime minister @entity88 said that everyone is concerned about the health of the @entity12 after he was taken to hospital with an infection			1
mr @entity88 said he was sure the @entity0 and the @entity12 would have gone ahead with sunday ’s river pageant in torrential rain regardless of the risks to their health after the day ’s exertions - spending four hours on the water - were blamed for his turn of ill - health			1
speaking to @entity101 , mr @entity88 said : ' it was a most extraordinary spectacle and obviously everyone is very concerned and worried and wants to know that ( the @entity12 ) is going to be ok			0
poignant : the queen , accompanied by prince @entity1 for the @entity105 on sunday , was on her own for the @entity106 outside @entity7 after he was taken to hospital suffering from a bladder infection unwell : prince @entity1 waves during sunday 's pageant royal visit : prince @entity47 arrives at the @entity8 near @entity113 , @entity9 , this afternoon to visit the @entity1 who he said has been watching the jubilee celebrations on the television royal departure : @entity43 , @entity43 , and her son @entity46 , leave the hospital after visiting the @entity1 this afternoon in older people a muddled mind can be one of the first signs of a bladder infection and can occur remarkably quickly			1
the onset of such symptoms can be alarming for family members , especially if the person affected is normally fit and well			0
the changes can be mistaken for early signs of dementia , or even a stroke			0
if it is left untreated it can lead to hallucinations or agitation			0
most doctors will , however , recognise the signs and order a urine test			0
they can then use a working diagnosis of a urinary tract infection until the test results arrive			2
antibiotics are standard treatment and effective , especially when given intravenously – bringing the patient back to normality within a few days			2
@entity147 doctor @entity146 said the duke ’s condition could be a sign of other issues with his health			0
he said : ‘ in a man of around 90 , the thing that you would think of is some form of bladder outlet obstruction which would , at the top of the list , be some form of obstruction around the prostate			2
’ but he also stressed that if treated early , the condition was very controllable			2
' the thing about our @entity164 is that they are incredibly dedicated to what they do and they are incredibly dedicated to doing it , no matter what the circumstances			0
' i do n’t know all the conversations that took place but i would be pretty certain that her majesty and the @entity1 would have wanted to do what they did and would have carried on doing it			1
' on monday night the @entity0 was visibly moved as prince @entity181 joked that the @entity1 might hear the jubilee concert from his bed if the crowd shouted loud enough			2
in a warm , emotional and often witty speech in praise of his mother at the close of the @entity106 , that appeared to make her lip quiver more than once , the @entity181 said it was sad that the @entity1 could not be at the event after being taken unwell while the @entity12 ’s condition is not believed to be serious , doctors will not be taking any chances , given his advancing years , because bladder infections in the elderly can get worse very quickly if not treated promptly			1
questions are likely to be asked whether it was wise to allow the @entity12 , who had a stent inserted in his heart less than six months ago , to take part in sunday ’s @entity66 , standing in the rain for four hours			1
it is understood that staff at ambulance control in @entity208 received a call from @entity210 shortly after 2pm reporting that prince @entity1 was feeling unwell			1
the medical crew used a chair to help him into the ambulance			0
despite his advancing years the @entity0 ’s husband has largely enjoyed good health and most of his past ailments have been sports - related			2
before undergoing heart surgery at @entity221 his most recent previous illness was a cold in october last year which forced him to pull out of an overnight stay in @entity224			2
one of his most serious bouts of ill health came in 2008 when he was admitted to hospital in @entity9 with a chronic chest infection			1
the @entity12 ’s absence from the rest of the @entity5 events will come as a terrible blow to his wife of 64 years			0
although she is , ostensibly , the ‘ senior partner ’ in their relationship , she relies on her husband ‘ utterly ’			0
‘ it may be a cliché but he truly is the power behind the throne , ’ said a source .			0

@entity1 was taken ill with a bladder infection after spending four hours standing in the cold and rain during @entity66 on sunday
@entity7 says he is feeling much better but will remain in hospital until he is fully recovered
