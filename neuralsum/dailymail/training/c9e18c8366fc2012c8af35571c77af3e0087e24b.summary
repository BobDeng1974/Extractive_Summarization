by @entity0 published : 18:53 est , 4 october 2013 updated : 18:57 est , 4 october 2013 after five years of trying for a baby , @entity1 was beginning to wonder if it would ever happen			1
she had taken fertility drugs for two years , to no avail			0
eventually , she and her husband @entity6 decided to resort to @entity7			2
but weeks before the treatment was due to begin , mrs @entity8 became pregnant – after giving up bread			2
@entity1 was told @entity7 was her only chance of conceiving a child following five years of trying with no success the result was the couple ’s daughter @entity15 , now two , who was born two weeks late in january 2011 after a healthy pregnancy			1
mrs @entity1 , a 37 - year - old engineer , stopped eating foods containing high levels of yeast on the advice of a nutritionist , who she went to see because she wanted to adopt a healthier lifestyle before starting @entity7			1
she explained : ‘ i cut out potatoes , bread , garlic bread , toast from my diet , and mainly ate just vegetables and fruit			0
i also took some health supplements			0
‘ two months later – that was the only change i had made for five and a half years – and i was pregnant			2
‘ now we are just very happy , especially after everything we went through , that @entity15 ’s come into our life			0
’ she and @entity6 , 50 , met in @entity39 in 2004 , when they were both in the military , and started trying for a baby a year later			1
after nine months with no luck , mrs @entity1 went to see an army medic and was eventually diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome , which stops eggs being released			1
mrs @entity1 , from @entity48 , @entity49 , said : ‘ they said i ’d need extra help to get pregnant and that it would n’t go away on its own			2
‘ they recommended i go to a fertility clinic in @entity55 , where i started on a course of treatment			0
’ @entity1 was pregnant with her daughter @entity15 within two months and she was born in 2011 after a healthy pregnancy mrs @entity1 took clomid , a fertility drug used to help re-balance the body ’s hormones to increase the chance of ovulation , for more than two years – without success			1
doctors told her the next step would be @entity7			0
but when she visited @entity69 , a nutrition and fertility consultant at @entity72 and @entity73 , she was told she was suffering from an infection caused by an overgrowth of a fungus called @entity77			0
this is encouraged by eating foods that contain yeast , such as bread			1
one of its side effects is menstrual problems , including the stopping of periods altogether , which in turn prevents pregnancy			0
in march 2010 , mrs @entity1 had her first period in six months and by april the same year she was pregnant			1
she added : ‘ i did n’t really go to the centre to get pregnant , just to stand me in good stead for @entity7 but thankfully we did n’t have to go down that route			2
‘ it just shows what years of abuse – drinking too much and eating the wrong things – can do to your body			0
