@entity4 was celebrating her birthday at a pizza restaurant in @entity7 , which she deliberately chose because she had previously breastfed there without any complaints			1
but when she asked a waiter if she was allowed to feed her baby daughter @entity11 at the table , he said she had to cover up			1
the employee told ms @entity4 that customers had previously complained about breastfeeding mothers - but a manager later apologised to her , and said that she should have been allowed to feed her daughter freely			1
anger : @entity4 was told she could not breastfeed daughter @entity11 in a restaurant without covering up the issue of breastfeeding in public has become a controversial topic recently after a mother was ordered to cover herself while nursing her baby in top @entity26 hotel @entity25			1
ms @entity4 , 30 , went with her mother and daughter to @entity29 , in @entity7 's @entity30 , to mark her birthday earlier this month			1
even though she breastfed @entity11 during a previous visit , she decided out of politeness to check with a waiter that it was all right to do so again - but he said it was not			1
' i always wondered what i would do if i was ever asked to cover my baby up to feed her , but i just stood there , ' she said			2
' i was so shocked , i just walked in and sat down , i did n't know what else to do			0
' the waiter clearly did not think he had done anything wrong , he had no idea how awkward he made us feel			2
when we sat down i asked to speak to a manager but i think he thought i was joking			2
