in the work , which dates from 1684 , a woman named @entity10 lists the catalogue of abuse she suffered at the hands of her overbearing and violent husband			1
although mrs @entity10 eventually escaped her abusive spouse , she first endured being beaten and starved and a violent incident involving a gun - all of which is detailed in in a @entity19 and @entity20 of the case of mrs @entity10			1
tragic : the 1684 pamphlet documents the violence @entity10 endured at the hands of her husband work : dr @entity25 , who found the pamphlet , has now turned the tale into a book now her harrowing story has been turned into a book , the case of mistress @entity10 , by academic dr @entity25			1
' men were allowed to correct their wives but were not allowed to be permanently damaging , ' explains dr @entity33			2
' for instance , they could withhold delicacies from their wives but should not starve them			2
@entity37 households would have been separated from their neighbours and there would have been less opportunity for people to see and hear the abuse			1
' if a wife was a runaway she would have no rights to anything			2
often she would be legally forced to go back to the house she had left			0
' at that time the community would try to intervene if they thought there was a risk of long term damage to the woman and in a lot of cases servants would intervene			0
' mrs @entity10 's story began in 1656 when she married solicitor @entity59 aged 17 under pressure from her family			1
her husband 's behaviour swiftly deteriorated , with @entity10 suffering a litany of abuse that included frequent beatings , occasionally in front of mr @entity59 's friends			1
' this [ some financial dealings ] i was speaking to him of , which he was very angry at , and said i reproached him , and did strike me upon the brest [ sic ] which grew very bad , ' writes mrs @entity10 in the pamphlet			1
terrifying : the ducking seat was often employed to punish ' common scolds ' during the 17th century ' he went out of town , and left me in a sad and weak condition with very little money			0
' later she adds : ' the next morning [ @entity59 ] came to my bed - side , and told me if i would not arise and be gone i should starve there			0
' for he had given strict order to my maid , his clark [ sic ] and laundress , not to let me have anything to eat			0
and all that day i could get nothing to eat			0
' he came to me at twelve a clock [ sic ] , and seeing my maid had brought me some broth to drink , did threaten her			0
' about eleven a clock at night i went into his study to speak with him , hoping his fury was abated			2
he drew a pistol out of his pocket and set it to my throat saying , that if i would not be gone out of his lodgings he would kill me			1
' @entity100 : men were allowed to punish their wives , here with a @entity104 , during @entity10 's lifetime horrific : a period illustration detailing the fate of women inside the @entity109 in 1691 @entity10 then tells of being beaten by her husband in front of other men			1
she writes : ' so soon as they were in the chamber , mr. @entity59 shut the door , and said that i came to molest him , and did strike me upon the head to the ground ; then threw me against a glass - door			0
' feeling myself hurt in the arm with the glass ( although much ashamed ) i cryed [ sic ] out			0
the two men @entity124 and @entity125 stood as applauders of mr. @entity59			0
' when i cryed out mr. @entity59 opened his inward chamber door , and there was his cleark [ sic ] and another man , ready at mr. @entity59 's order to drag me into the street			2
' and at the @entity134 , the cleark said i was mad , and that they had order to bring me to @entity137			0
' after plucking up the courage to leave her abusive husband , mrs @entity10 spent much of her time in @entity141 , visiting @entity142 occasionally in a bid to claim alimony			1
when , in desperation , she published her pamphlet , her husband replied with a similar publication in which he accused his wife of trying to murder him			1
' when people felt that they had come to the end of what they could expect from the legal system they would go public , publishing stories of their marital problems , ' explains dr @entity33			0
' they did it to make some money or to try to repair their reputation by getting their side of the story out			2
' her new book , the case of mistress @entity10 , includes the full text of the 1684 pamphlet plus extensive extra material , which examines the episode in depth and rounds out the story of @entity10 , who died in 1698 , after a few short , final years of relative peace and prosperity .			1
