the widow of @entity2 's sniper colleague has hit out at the @entity4 - nominated film ' @entity5 ' , claiming it portrays her late husband as a coward who ' questioned @entity10 's mission in @entity11 '			1
@entity12 , whose shooting death in the then - battle - torn city of @entity15 is graphically depicted in the $ 264million box - office sensation , was deployed abroad with the @entity17 in april 2006			1
over the next four months , he served alongside his @entity19 ' brothers ' , including @entity2 , who is played by @entity20 and whose death aged 38 at a @entity10 rifle range is not featured in the movie			2
however , on august 2 , 2006 , @entity12 was shot dead in a gunfight after stepping into the line of fire to protect his teammates - an action that saw him posthumously awarded two separate honors			1
now , his widow , @entity29 has criticized ' @entity5 's ' portrayal of her husband 's service in @entity11 , saying it ' deeply sacrificed ' his ' truths and beliefs ' , as well as his selfless , but ' strong ' character			1
right , his widow , @entity39 , said ' @entity5 ' ' deeply sacrificed ' her husband 's ' truths and beliefs ' ' seal brothers ' : during his time in @entity11 before his death in august 2006 , @entity12 ( played by @entity54 , right , in the film ) served alongside his @entity19 ' brothers ' , including @entity2 , portrayed by @entity20 ( left ) in an article for @entity58 , ms @entity29 , who met @entity12 in @entity59 , @entity60 in 2001 , and married him in 2002 , wrote : ' the character of @entity12 falls short on everything that the real @entity12 stood for and what @entity2 expresses about his brother and teammate in his book , which inspired the film			1
' she continued : ' the movie portrays @entity12 as a reluctant warrior - one who seems casual in combat - who questions @entity10 's mission in @entity11			1
nothing could be further from the truth			0
in contrast to the movie , @entity12 was a fierce fighter who believed he was making a difference in @entity11			2
' ms @entity29 , whose final memories of @entity12 are of him boarding the @entity80 's @entity79 aircraft with @entity19 in 2006 , said her husband truly ' believed in the war with his whole heart '			1
this belief stemmed not only from @entity12 's desire to serve for his beloved country , @entity10 , but also to ' protect innocent @entity11 who lived in constant fear of terrorists ' , she wrote in the article			2
as a ' @entity90 ' , @entity12 would do anything for his ' seal brothers ' , she said			0
these included @entity2 , whose autobiography inspired the blockbuster hit , which was has been nominated for six @entity4			0
in action : in an article for @entity58 , ms @entity29 , who met @entity12 ( pictured , front , in action with the @entity101 ) in @entity59 , @entity60 in 2001 , and married him in 2002 , wrote : ' the character of @entity12 falls short on everything that the real @entity12 stood for and what @entity2 expresses about his brother and teammate ' teammates : @entity12 ( pictured , left , in his @entity109 attire ) worked alongside @entity2 ( right ) in @entity11 in 2006			1
the latter was shot dead at the age of 38 by former @entity113 @entity112 at a rifle range in @entity115 , @entity116 , in 2013 happier times : @entity12 embraces miss @entity29 on their wedding day in 2002 - four years before his deployment indeed , the sniper 's willingness to make ' the ultimate sacrifice for his country ' saw him receive the @entity125 and the @entity126 posthumously			1
he was also granted the @entity127 for his service			0
while ms @entity29 said @entity12 's initial desire to become a pastor before joining the @entity17 was depicted accurately in the film , she wrote his reason for choosing the latter career was wrongly portrayed			1
she described the remarks by actor @entity54 ( who plays @entity12 in the film ) that he decided to join the seals because he was a ' gambling man ' as ' bizarre ' and not reflective of her husband 's drive			2
she also revealed that the final letter @entity12 wrote before he shot dead was ' severely edited ' by film executives , giving it a different , ' false ' meaning that implied he died after giving up on his mission			1
' @entity2 's character says : " the war did n't kill @entity12 , his letter did " - a confusing reference to those who knew @entity12 because it seems to suggest @entity12 gave up on the mission , and that led to his death , ' she said , adding that her husband remained a devout @entity153 until he died , while she is @entity154			1

he is portrayed by @entity54 in the film ( right ) however , she emphasized that she is ' truly happy ' for ' @entity5 's ' success - and does not want her comments about her husband 's film portrayal to deter from the story of @entity2 's achievements			1
