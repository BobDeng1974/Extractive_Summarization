it could hardly be a more typical weekend scene : a family stroll for mum , dad , baby and a proud grandmother			0
but this is no typical family			0
look closer and you 'll recognise the smart lady in black as broadcaster and campaigner dame @entity11			1
and the smile hides a sadness – as the casually dressed group have come together in circumstances that are more rancorous than relaxed			0
for although @entity18 was delighted when her second grandchild , @entity19 , arrived , @entity17 can reveal that he is the result of an affair and an acrimonious marriage breakdown			1
campaigner dame @entity11 seen walking with her son dr @entity25 ( pushing his new baby @entity19 ) and his partner , @entity28 - @entity27 the baby 's father is @entity18 's son , dr @entity25			1
his partner , @entity28 - @entity27 , a married mother of two , left her husband for @entity25 after they had an affair			1
the split has reportedly left the deserted husband in a state of devastation			1
this might explain why the broadcaster , who was married to the late film - maker and @entity41 executive @entity40 , has been rather reticent about the new addition to the family , commenting only briefly to confirm he will be known as @entity19			1
neither parent has been willing to speak in public so far , but a close friend , who knows the details of the marriage break - up , says the pair met when junior doctor @entity25 , 34 , and @entity51 , 36 , began working at @entity52 where she was an @entity53 nurse			1
the friend suggests that @entity51 fell pregnant just months into the new relationship			0
the campaigner 's second grandchild , @entity19 is the result of an affair and an acrimonious marriage breakdown @entity28 - @entity27 ( right ) and her husband @entity60 ( left ) were childhood sweethearts and he has been left devastated by split @entity25 and @entity51 now live together with @entity19 and her children in a smart penthouse flat in a crescent of period townhouses overlooking the marina in @entity69			1
it is understood that the decision was supported by @entity18 , who has frequently highlighted the anguish suffered by grandparents who are denied access to their grandchildren and then lose touch			0
@entity51 was clearly delighted at the pregnancy and proud that her new son bears the @entity25 surname			1
within three days of his birth she posted her new son 's photograph on @entity84 , writing : ' our new little bundle , @entity19 '			1
at a not so little nine pounds nine ounces			0
' @entity51 's mother , @entity87 , also posted a picture of the child			0
if @entity18 appears to be in a forgiving mood , it is perhaps understandable as this is not the first time an extra marital affair has featured in her family life			2
she was a reporter at the @entity41 , working alongside @entity40 's wife @entity96 , when she began an affair with @entity25 , who was then her boss			1
traumatised by her husband 's affair , @entity96 became so ill she was admitted to @entity100			2
@entity18 moved into the home @entity96 had shared with @entity25 to help look after his children			2
@entity96 refused to divorce @entity25 , only eventually agreeing when , after a number years , @entity18 became pregnant			2
she and @entity25 married in 1977 and had three children , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity25			1
the broadcaster and founder of @entity109 with her son @entity25 at a dinner in @entity112 in 2001 for one person , however , the events of the past few months have been less than happy			2
for @entity60 , @entity28 - @entity51 's husband and childhood sweetheart , news of her affair came as a shock			1
his friends say he had believed his marriage was stable until she became increasingly distant			0
he moved out of the family home last march , assuming he would return home when the pair had settled their differences			0
in august , @entity51 agreed to meet him and – accompanied by her mother – told her husband that she was pregnant with @entity25 's child			1
they had been married since 2001 , and a family source said : ' @entity60 absolutely worshipped @entity28 - @entity132 ' she wanted nice things in life and he bust a gut to make sure he could provide them			1
' it was n't enough though			0
@entity51 bored easily and she became tired of @entity60			2
@entity25 was the bright new thing and she loves mentioning his surname			2
' @entity60 is now slowly moving on with his life , ' says a friend			0
' he has met someone new but finds it very difficult to accept another man is living with the woman who is still , technically , his wife and helping to bring up his children			0
' but he is glad to be free of her now			0
part of him feels people should know just how badly @entity51 has behaved and what she is really like			0
' the other part loves his children too much to denigrate their mother so publicly			0
it has all been incredibly hard for @entity60			0
