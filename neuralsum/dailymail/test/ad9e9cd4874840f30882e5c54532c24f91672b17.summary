@entity0 insists a good start to the domestic season with @entity4 holders @entity5 could help him make a case for an @entity8 recall			1
@entity0 last played in the @entity8 whites during the 5 - 0 @entity11 defeat in the winter of 2013/14 , though in recent months he enjoyed a @entity14 training session with the squad in @entity16 and also turned out for the @entity17 on their tour of @entity19			1
more importantly perhaps , the double ashes - winner helped end @entity5 's 13 - year wait for a title last season , taking 30 wickets in 10 games at an average of 31.57 and making 95 against @entity27 on the day the championship was clinched			1
@entity0 is keen to give @entity8 's selectors no choice but to pick him with wickets and runs for @entity5 the right - arm quick last played in whites for @entity8 during the @entity11 whitewash of winter 2013/14 with @entity39 and @entity16 still to come this year , the @entity38 faithful 's belief of ' strong @entity5 , strong @entity8 ' is already showing good signs with six @entity42 players currently on tour in the @entity44			1
@entity0 says : ' the only thing i can do is get runs and take wickets for @entity5 ' and when asked if he would like to make it number seven , @entity0 said , ' that 's up to the selectors			1
' ' if i do get a load of wickets at the start of the season and get a few runs then i put my case forward , that 's all i can do - then it 's up to the selectors			2
' obviously , the only thing i can do is get runs and take wickets for @entity5			2
' that 's what i 'm looking to do			0
whatever happens after that we 'll just let it play out			0
' we 're defending champions , so we 're going to do our utmost to defend the title			0
' if we play the consistent cricket we did last year - which we are capable of - we 'll be there and thereabouts again			0
' @entity0 did take a step towards that good start on wednesday , when he reached 400 first - class wickets during @entity5 's game against @entity77 - @entity76 at @entity38			1
but regardless of his own selection , @entity0 is confident @entity8 can put in a good showing against @entity39 and @entity16 after a turbulent year that also included an early @entity81 exit			2
' i think we 'll do well , ' @entity0 said			2
' i think they 've got all the talent			0
@entity5 captain @entity85 celebrates as @entity5 beat @entity86 to win the 2014 @entity4 @entity5 go to @entity87 on @entity88 for the first match of their four - day title defence ' they just need to start implementing it , start applying that talent and playing good attacking cricket			1
they are very capable of doing it			0
' @entity0 did express his disappointment at @entity8 's tour matches against @entity100 and @entity101 , where some of the @entity103 side have padded up for the hosts in a bid to give the bowlers a higher - quality challenge			1
' obviously , they 've tried to make the best of a bad situation , ' he said			0
' it 's very difficult when you go on tour and you do n't get decent opposition to practice games			0
' but at the end of the day there 's nothing @entity8 can do about it			0
