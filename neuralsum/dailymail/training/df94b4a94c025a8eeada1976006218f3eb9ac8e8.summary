as humans , we can distinguish between different objects easily - such as dogs wearing hats , or between oranges and bananas in a bag - but for computers this has been typically much more difficult			1
a team of @entity12 researchers has developed an advanced image classification and detection algorithm called @entity15 , which is twice as effective than previous programs			1
it is so accurate it can locate and distinguish between a range of object sizes within a single image , and it can also determine an object within , or on top of , an object , within the photo			1
a team of @entity27 - based @entity12 researchers developed @entity15 , that uses an advanced classification and detection algorithm to identify object			1
the technology is so accurate , it can distinguish a range of object sizes , and it can also determine an object within or on an object – such as a dog wearing a hat ( pictured ) the software recently placed first in the @entity41 large - scale visual recognition challenge ( @entity42 )			1
the @entity12 researchers began by training neural networks to carry out the recognition tasks similar to how the human brain works			1
the layers and structure of the algorithm were based on the @entity52 principle , for example , which describes how neurons adapt in the brain as we learn			2
it also features scale invariance , which states that objects do n’t change even if they ’re multiplied by a common factor			0
for example , at its most basic , making an image of an object larger or smaller does n’t change the object , its shape or proportions			0
this helps the software learn the shape and size of different objects , no matter how small , and be able to recognise them in the future			0
a more detailed explanation is available from the @entity76			0
this annual academic challenge was set up to test state - of - the - art technology in image understanding , both in the sense of recognising objects in images and locating where they are			1
@entity12 has made the software open to other developers , to help increase its accuracy , and in the future , the technology could be used to improve @entity91 searches			1
it could also scour @entity93 videos for specific objects or shapes			1
the competition has three categories , including classification , classification with localisation , and detection			2
the classification track measures an algorithm ’s ability to assign correct labels to an image			2
the classification with localisation category assesses how well an algorithm finds an object within an image , and how accurate its label is			1
finally , the detection challenge is similar , but uses stricter evaluation criteria			0
as an additional difficulty , the challenge includes images with tiny objects that are hard to recognise and locate , even by the human eye			0
the software recently placed first in the @entity41 large - scale visual recognition challenge ( @entity42 )			0
this annual academic challenge was set up to test state - of - the - art technology in image understanding , both in the sense of recognising objects in images and locating where they are			1
examples are pictured the researchers began by training neural networks to carry out the tasks similar to how the human brain works			0
this was based on the @entity52 principle , which describes how neurons adapt in the brain as we learn			0
this helps the software learn the shape and size of different objects , no matter how small ( examples pictured ) to score highly in the challenge , an algorithm must be able to describe a complex scene by accurately locating and identifying all the multiple objects in it			2
in this year ’s challenge , team @entity15 doubled the quality of last year 's results			2
the algorithm was created by @entity12 interns @entity155 and @entity156 , as well as @entity12 researchers , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity156 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , and software engineer @entity163			1

in this year ’s challenge , team @entity15 doubled the quality of last year 's results			2
the technology built upon image recognition research carried out by @entity182 from the @entity183 , which was able to teach computers to divide images into objects ( pictured ) for example , at its most basic , making an image of an object larger or smaller does n’t change the object , its shape or proportions			2

software engineer @entity163 concluded : ‘ these technological advances will enable even better image understanding on our side and the progress is directly transferable to @entity12 products such as photo search , image search , @entity93 , self - driving cars , and any place where it is useful to understand what is in an image as well as where things are			1

a team of @entity12 researchers and *students* has developed @entity15
it recognises objects using a classification and detection algorithm
the technology is so accurate , it can distinguish a range of object sizes
it can also determine an object within , or on , another object - such as a dog wearing a hat
the technology could be used to improve @entity91 searches
it could also scour @entity93 videos for specific objects or shapes
