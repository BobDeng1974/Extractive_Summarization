' at that moment it was as though a bomb had exploded inside my world , destroying every certainty			0
' i could barely think			0
' although @entity12 was crying with hunger , the last thing i wanted to do was to get out my breast and start feeding her , knowing there was something alien and poisonous growing in there , but i knew she needed my milk			0

i could n’t have imagined that something so awful could happen			0

‘ when i had my first round of chemo i felt so sick that i could n’t interact with @entity12 – all i could do was come home and take her to bed with me			0
