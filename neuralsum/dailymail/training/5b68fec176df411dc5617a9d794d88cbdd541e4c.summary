by @entity0 the shocking neglect of drug addict parents whose five - month - old baby boy drowned in the bath while they were ' distracted ' has been revealed in a new report			1
when father @entity6 found his baby son @entity7 lying underwater in the tub he merely sat the tot up again and left the room , before the child once again slipped below the waterline			1
he was later pronounced dead in hospital , having been taken there from his home in @entity15 , @entity16 , in july 2010			0
tragedy : five - month - old @entity18 drowned in the bath while his drug addict parents were ' distracted ' , a new report has revealed @entity6 and the baby 's mother @entity22 were originally charged with culpable homicide in connection with @entity7 's death but the case was dropped by prosecutors			1
now a new report compiled by former @entity31 chief constable @entity30 has found that @entity7 's death could have been prevented had he been taken into care from birth			1
the significant case review , commissioned by @entity16 ’s child protection committee , found that the death of the baby , referred to as @entity38 in the report , could not have been anticipated			1
however , it criticises the decision not to place @entity7 in care , and lists further failures , including the removal of @entity7 from a child protection register			1
mr @entity30 also details how there were chances to save the baby , and that ' accommodating @entity38 at birth ... would have prevented his death in these circumstances '			1
the death would also have been prevented ' if the parents had fulfilled their parental responsibility that night and had not left the baby on his own ' , the report found			1
parents : @entity6 and @entity22 were originally charged with culpable homicide in connection with @entity7 's death but the case was dropped by the @entity61 according to the report , @entity7 was in a portable bath in the living room , while ms @entity22 was running a bath for mr @entity6 in the bathroom			1
mr @entity6 had become aware that his son was in distress in the tub , had propped him back up again and left the room			1
' the father was fully aware that the mother was not in the living room with the baby when he left it			1
the parents claimed that they had left the baby alone in the bath and when they returned he was submerged and unconscious , ' mr @entity30 wrote , according the @entity80			1
the report also revealed how a police officer investigating the case said that ' it was clear to him that both parents were distracted '			2
' the stark reality is that the death of @entity38 could have been prevented if the parents had fulfilled their parental responsibility that night and had not left the baby on his own ' @entity16 and it revealed how @entity7 's parents said they would often use the baby bath 's seat to prop @entity7 up so he could see the television , which they claimed stopped him from crying			1
mr @entity30 made 17 recommendations for various agencies , centred on issues such as information sharing , leadership and resources			0
he also criticised social workers , the police and the @entity104 for failing to adequately report concerns about the baby 's care , and not gaining access to the family home on several occasions			2
mr @entity30 said there were ' huge question marks hanging over the decision that was taken to discharge the baby into the care of the parents '			1
mr @entity6 also had a baby daughter who died in a bath accident in @entity15 in 1985			1
a redacted report by @entity16 ’s chief officers group , responding to the independent findings , notes that the boy was the subject of a multi-agency support plan at the time of his death and that he had previously been on the child protection register			2
prior to his birth , a ' high risk pregnancy referral ' had been made to social workers by the midwifery service			0
@entity7 was transferred to ' special care ' when he was born in february that year and discharged home around six weeks later			2
findings : former chief constable of the @entity137 , pictured being awarded a cbe by the @entity139 , wrote in his report that @entity7 could have been saved , and should have been taken into care at birth officials decided to remove his name from the child protection register on april 26 that year after a case conference heard how the family was engaging well with the various agencies involved			1
outlining the key findings of the review , the council ’s report found ' an incredible amount of effort ' was made to support the parents and that the baby had been progressing well under their care			1
but it adds : ' the independent review officer concluded that the stark reality is that the death of @entity38 could have been prevented if the parents had fulfilled their parental responsibility that night and had not left the baby on his own			1
' it continued : ' the independent review officer recognised the complex family history and ... concluded that the death of @entity38 could have been prevented if he had been accommodated at birth			2
' the review findings also noted that such a decision in the case of @entity38 was extremely difficult given the range of factors which services had to take into account			2
' the review further highlighted ' missed opportunities ' when professionals could have shared information more effectively about the parents ’ lifestyle , taken action in response to changes in parental circumstances and made immediate decisions about their capacity to continue to care for the child			2
in response , @entity16 pointed to what it said were a range of improvements and developments which have been put in place to keep children safe			0
no disciplinary action has been taken against any staff member involved , it confirmed			0
@entity197 , chair of the child protection committee , said : ' child protection professionals will always strive to keep children safe , and where possible , families are supported to care for their children at home			0
in this situation , the multi-agency child protection team put in place a package of measures to help the family care for @entity210 ' the independent review officer recognised that the child protection team tried their level best to support the family , and noted that staff could not have anticipated that this event would happen			2
' this significant case review has been carefully considered by the agencies involved and there has been a determined effort to understand and learn important lessons from this incident			2
we are committed to working together to keep children safe from harm through continuous improvements and developments in practice			0
' @entity228 abuse victim @entity229 , eight , who lived in @entity230 , north @entity231 , died in february 2000 after being beaten , starved and tortured by her great - aunt @entity228 and @entity228 's lover @entity228 , who are now serving life imprisonment for murder			0
@entity229 was burned with cigarettes , often tied up and hit with bike chains , hammers and wires , and the abuse had been noted by the police , the social services department of four local authorities , including @entity230 council , the @entity104 , and charity the @entity240 , as well as local churches			0
however , during the trial following her death a judge described the failure by all to properly investigate the case as ' blinding incompetence '			0
a public inquiry , headed by @entity255 , also found there were numerous instances where @entity229 could have been saved and a subsequent report made numerous recommendations related to child protection in @entity261			0
@entity262 widely known as @entity263 , 17 - month - old @entity262 , died in august 2007 , after suffering more than 50 injuries in just eight months , during which he was repeatedly seen by @entity104 staff and @entity268 - the same local authority that failed @entity228			0
prior to his death , @entity262 had been admitted to hospital with injuries , and on one occasion , just days before his death , injuries to @entity263 's face and hands were missed by a social worker after the child was deliberately smeared with chocolate to hide them			0
@entity262 's mother @entity263 , her boyfriend @entity263 , and @entity285 's brother @entity284 were all convicted of causing or allowing the death of a child , the mother having pleaded guilty to the charge			0

at the time he died he had been tortured for six months and weighed just 1st 9lb , the same as an 18 - month - old child			0
a review following his death also found that chances to save @entity295 , who had gained the attention of social services and police - who visted the home 26 times , had been missed , but did not blame any individual agency			0
