by @entity0 published : 04:49 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 03:27 est , 1 may 2013 this terrifying collection of shotguns , knives and samurai swords was discovered in the boot of a car carrying six @entity9 jihadists who plotted to kill and maim hundreds of people			1
a nail bomb packed with 458 pieces of shrapnel and parts for a pipe bomb were also found			1
the gang had evaded the security services and their car was only searched after being impounded because the driver did not have insurance			2
the terrorists now face lengthy jail sentences after admitting the plot – a protest against the @entity54 – at @entity36 yesterday			2
the court heard that the men drove from @entity57 on june 30 last year to set off the bomb at the rally in @entity30 , @entity31			2
however , the meeting had finished early and by the time they arrived everyone had dispersed			2
on the way back , the gang ’s @entity64 was stopped by a policeman in a random spot - check on the @entity69			2
he impounded the car after discovering it was uninsured			0
it later emerged that one of the terrorists had tried to insure it , but entered the wrong registration number on an online form			0
the car was taken to a pound near @entity81 where it sat for two days until a worker found the weapons and ten copies of a note addressed to the @entity87 , @entity88 and ‘ the enemies of @entity90 ’			1
nail bomb : this 18 - inch long device contains 458 pieces of shrapnel and was to be powered by explosives taken from at least two large fireworks explosive : ball bearings and nails which were found inside the nail bomb when it was taken apart by police ballistics experts cache of weapons : a fearsome haul of knives which were found hidden inside the @entity64 after it was pulled over because it had no insurance it called the @entity87 a ‘ female devil ’ and accused her of ‘ fooling a nation of blind sheep ’			1
to the @entity24 , it said : ‘ we love death more than you love life			0
’ staff at the pound called the police , who called in counter- terrorism teams			0
the next morning , @entity33 phoned to ask if he could pick up the car and he and passenger @entity124 were arrested , along with @entity32 , who had not been in the car but whose fingerprints were found on the weapons			1
pipe bomb : these are parts of a partially put together pipe bomb which was seized by police other passengers @entity28 , @entity38 and @entity39 were arrested after their taxi was stopped in @entity57			2
police and @entity137 had no idea about the plot , despite @entity26 being named a ‘ subject of interest ’ in 2011 after he collected money for a terror cell , the members of which were jailed last week for more than 90 years for plotting suicide attacks using rucksack bombs			0
@entity38 was on bail for separate terror charges , and @entity28 was the brother of @entity147 , who was jailed for 40 months for his part in the rucksack bomb plot			1
rally : the plotters were targeting this @entity24 rally in @entity30 , @entity31 , but were foiled because they arrived too late - after the crowds had gone it also emerged that police and security services saw @entity26 and @entity33 go into a shop in @entity57 five days before the planned attack			1
they bought kitchen knives but police were keeping their distance and did n’t see the purchase			0
@entity26 , 27 , @entity38 , 22 , @entity33 , 31 , @entity28 , 24 , @entity39 , 22 , and @entity32 , 23 , were told to expect ‘ significant custody ’ by judge @entity165 , @entity166 , who adjourned sentencing until june 6			0
@entity168 , head of the counter terrorism unit at @entity170 , said : ‘ we do not believe that any one individual failed because the dots were there and they did not join them up			0
’ caught on camera : five of the men are seen on @entity179 in @entity30 at approximately 4.37pm - two hours after the @entity24 rally had finished terror targets : @entity24 demonstrators were the target of the @entity90 extremists at the rally in @entity30 last june attack plan : around 750 @entity24 members , rivals from @entity188 and dozens of police officers were at the rally which the @entity90 extremists were targeting rally : penned in by police , these are the @entity24 protesters in @entity30 caught on police video from a helicopter			1
the gang of @entity90 fanatics were targeting the protest @entity191 finished early : the event was shorter than planned because @entity24 leader @entity201 , a crowd pleaser , was not able to attend a series of coincidences saw the plan by @entity90 fanatics to use bombs , guns and swords in a murderous attack on far - right extremists foiled			1
firstly , the five members of the gang who drove to the event on june 30 last year - all the men except @entity32 - made a mistake with their timing , arriving two hours late because the rally had finished earlier than expected			1
the event was shorter than planned because @entity24 leader @entity201 , a crowd pleaser , was not able to attend			0
seized : the group 's @entity64 is stopped on the @entity69 because it had no insurance and is seized - it was two days before the arsenal of weapons was discovered though then , as @entity33 and @entity26 drove their silver @entity64 back towards @entity57 down the @entity69 , it was recorded as uninsured when a traffic officer happened to carry out checks because the car looked old			1
in fact the gang had tried to insure the @entity64 for one day that morning , but @entity39 had mistakenly entered the wrong registration number on an online form			0
the car was seized because it had no insurance , and the officer took @entity26 and @entity33 to a nearby train station so that they could get home			1
it was taken to a pound near @entity81 by @entity241 , and left there until the following monday morning			0
staff then checked the contents of the car and found the gang 's array of weapons including two shotguns , swords , knives , a nail bomb and a partially assembled pipe bomb , along with a hate - filled note ranting about the enemies of @entity90			1
it was only then that counter-terrorism units were called in , despite the fact that police and security services already had @entity26 under low - level surveillance because he was on the periphery of another terrorist plot			2
held : traffic police stop @entity26 and @entity265 on the @entity69 as they travelled back to their home town , @entity57 and seize the vehicle this was the plan by another group of extremists from @entity57 to set off up to eight rucksack bombs and possibly other devices in an attack that they wanted to be bigger than july 7			1
@entity26 had been seen with @entity33 going into a shop five days before the rally , but no officer followed them into @entity279 in @entity280 because contact would have been too close			2
in fact they were going to buy the kitchen knives that were among the weapons that the gang planned to use			0
neither counter-terrorist police or the security services had any intelligence to suggest that the men planned to stage an atrocity			0
after their weapons were found , bomb squad were called to make the shrapnel - filled rocket safe , and said afterwards that it was ' viable ' , with the potential to cause serious injury or death			1
counter-terrorism teams launched a fast - moving operation , tracing @entity33 , who had initially given a false name , and his passenger by scouring @entity179			0
@entity33 had the gall to call the pound to say that he needed to get something from the car , but unbeknown to him he was already under surveillance			0
police believe that he made the nail bomb because his fingerprint was discovered on the sticky side of tape found on the device			1
@entity170 counter-terrorism unit also discovered that the @entity64 was travelling with a gold rover 25 , and again used @entity179 pictures to trace the three occupants .			0
