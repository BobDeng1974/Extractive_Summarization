@entity8 , 22 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , was paddling with @entity11 , 25 , in the @entity12 in @entity13 when the mammal leapt out of the water onto the end of her kayak			1
the couple caught the entire encounter , in the sea near @entity22 , on camera			2
' it started edging towards me , which i did n't really like because the locals told us not to go within 20 metres of the area 's fur seals , as they can bite			0
' i was quite scared but then it started to sniff around in my hair and touched my face			1
' it also kept putting its face into the water as though it was looking for something			2
visitor : @entity8 said that the seal sat on the end of the kayak and kept looking down into the water as if it were searching for something ' eventually it slid back into the water and came around to the front , and tried to jump back onto the kayak between me and @entity11			0
' it tried about three times but kept failing because it was too high			0
she added : ' it kept swimming around us for a few minutes more , before quickly disappearing back towards the rocks of the island			0
' @entity8 posted the video online and some followers commented that a shark can be seen in one part of her film , but @entity8 and @entity11 , who works in hospitality , are unsure			1
