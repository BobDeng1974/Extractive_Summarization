by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 9 november 2013 updated : 17:59 est , 9 november 2013 it ’s called @entity2 , the latest health craze to hit @entity4 – and it ’s something i had no doubt was total nonsense			1
@entity8 uses it ‘ to manage stress ’ , and has now introduced it to her daughter @entity11			1
@entity13 , star of @entity14 and @entity15 , the forthcoming biopic about @entity15 , also swears by it			1
would that kind of endorsement alone persuade me to attend a class in a breathing technique that claims to be able to help depression , chronic pain , migraine , insomnia , anxiety and even asthma ? probably not			1
but two things have convinced me to attend a session hosted by @entity30 , aka ‘ the breath guru ’ , in @entity32			1
easy breathing : both @entity11 and @entity13 use @entity2 to help them stay calm and manage stress in their whirlwind @entity4 lives first , studies show that meditation , which uses breath control , is not only effective in treating anxiety , it physically alters the structure of the brain to make you more emotionally stable			1
second , i have a long , illustrious history of anxiety			1
my 20s were blighted by unbearable panic attacks and an anxiety disorder that triggered a four - year addiction to sleeping pills			1
an array of treatments , including cognitive behavioural therapy , brought it largely under control			1
it ’s years since i had a panic attack , but every now and then anxiety can grip me , manifesting in hypochondria , insomnia or stress that leaves me unable to concentrate or even vaguely enjoy myself			1
i ’ve tried meditation before but i always give up as i do n’t ever feel it ’s doing anything			1
now i ’ve decided to place my faith in @entity30 , a slight 50 - year - old with a goatee and a soothing voice			1
he describes the mechanics of the technique			1
‘ first of all , the inhalation and exhalation are of different lengths – about three to one			1
hands - on approach : @entity30 - the so called ' breath guru ' - teaches @entity2 in one of his @entity32 classes ‘ if you breathe in slowly for three counts or three seconds you exhale quickly for one – imagine you are trying to steam up some glass			1
‘ the longer inhale allows you to access more oxygen and energy			1
the exhale allows you to access any emotional energy that ’s been held in the system			1
it ’s like clearing out the trash			1
’ the next rule is to breathe with your mouth open – fairly wide , so you could at least fit a finger between your teeth			1
@entity30 says this helps increase the volume of air breathed in and out			1
‘ the other vital aspect is that you do n’t hold the breath at the peak of inhalation or exhalation but keep it moving			2
that ’s what puts you into an altered state of consciousness			2
’ anyone prone to anxiety is generally welcoming of any state other than an anxious one , so i keep listening			2
@entity30 instructs me to sit down with my back against some cushions , to close my eyes , open my mouth and place my hand on the bottom of my abdomen so i can feel it rise up each time i breathe in			2
this ensures the diaphragm is used more than the upper part of the lungs , which are deployed during exercise or panicky breathing			2
initially i ca n’t do it			2
there is so much to think about – keeping your hand on your belly , your mouth wide open , sticking to the unnatural rhythm of the longer inhale while also keeping the breath moving			2
my mouth becomes dry and my mind and body try to revolt against this strange process			2
but @entity30 encourages me to keep going and gradually i find the rhythm			2
the further into the session we go , the more strange things start to happen			2
first i crave indulgent food such as chocolate fondant			0
then my body temperature seems to rise			0
@entity147 is next , flooding up from my fingers through my arms , and through my feet into my shins			0
after what seems like about 15 minutes @entity30 tells me to bring my breathing back to a slow , regular rhythm and gently open my eyes			0
that ’s when the most dramatic effect becomes apparent			0
everything is slow – my mind , my reactions , my movements			0
the sense of calm is profound			0
it is , for want of a less hippy word , blissful			0
‘ how long was i doing that for ? ’ i ask			0
‘ an hour , ’ replies @entity30			0
for the rest of the evening i luxuriate in delicious , euphoric calm			0
the next day i ’m back to normal but with one chief difference : i know that by changing my breathing i can feel dramatically different			0
in the days that follow , when i feel stressed or unable to sleep , i take @entity30 ’s advice and practise it on my own for ten minutes			0
it works , although not to the same level of calm as the first time , presumably because i ’m only doing it for a fraction of the time			0
much of this is similar to the effects noticed by devotees of meditation , and yet the technique is different			0
so what could be happening physiologically ? dr @entity186 , who specialises in treating divers with decompression sickness , explains : ‘ it ’s a rising carbon dioxide level that triggers a breath			0
by deliberately slowing down your breathing , carbon dioxide levels build up in the body , and carbon dioxide does have quite a soporific effect on people , causing them to feel relaxed			0
’ this is , however , still debated			0
but i ’m in no doubt : where meditation failed , transformational breathing succeeded			0
it ’s the pill i wish i ’d had all along			0
