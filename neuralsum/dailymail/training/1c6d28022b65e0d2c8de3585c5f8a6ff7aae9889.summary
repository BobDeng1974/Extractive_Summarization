by @entity1 reporter published : 13:19 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 15:27 est , 30 april 2013 bodies tense and noses twitching , the dogs sniff the fertile hunting ground before them : a lower @entity8 alley , grimy , dim and perfect for rats			1
with a terse command -- ‘ now ! ’ -- the chase is on			0
circling , bounding over and pawing at a mound of garbage bags , the four dogs quickly have rodents on the run			0
‘ come on ... i mean , ` tally ho ! ' says one of their owners , @entity19			0
in a whirl of barks , pants and wagging tails , dogs tunnel among the bags and bolt down the alley as their quarry tries to scurry away			0
within five minutes , the city has two fewer rats			1
‘ it 's about maintaining the breed type through actual work , ’ says @entity78 , a @entity39 - based business analyst and longtime dog breeder who might be considered the group 's organizer -- if it would accept being called organized			1
known with a chuckle as the @entity87 - fed @entity47 -- parse the acronym -- the rodent - hunters have been scouring downtown byways for more than a decade , meeting weekly when weather allows			1

on a couple of recent nights , an eclectic group of ratters converged on an alley near @entity98 about an hour after sunset			0
the lineups included two border terriers ; a wire - haired dachshund ; a @entity104 mix ; a @entity106 terrier , an intense , no - nonsense breed that 's uncommon in this country ; and a feist , a type of dog developed in the @entity112 to tree squirrels			1
‘ get ` im ! go ! ’ @entity115 yelled as his cairn terrier , @entity116 , streaked down an alley after a fleeing rat			1
unlike many of the other owners , @entity115 does n't breed or show dogs , but he has taken @entity116 to several alley hunts			2
‘ i like watching him have fun , ’ @entity115 said			0
although the dogs have hunting instincts , it takes training to capitalize on them			0
just because your pet runs after backyard squirrels does n't mean it could ever catch one			0
when at its best , the alley pack works together			0
one dog will sniff out a rat and signal its whereabouts , often by barking			0
another leaps at the hideaway to rout the quarry , and then a third lurches to catch it as it flees			0
gruesome end : an unfortunate rat might get caught in a tug of war between dogs that circle and flank it final destination : all the rats killed in a night of hunting end up in the trash natural - born killer : @entity19 takes a rat from @entity153 , her @entity154 , that caught the rodent a rat that scuttles into the open might get caught in a rundown , or even a tug of war , between dogs that circle and flank it			1
after making a kill with a bite or a shake , the hunters trot back , rat in mouth , and allow their owners to take it from their jaws			2
the night 's kill ends up in a trash bin			0
there 's no official estimate of how many rats rove the city 's streets , basements , parks and subways			2
officials have tried a number of innovative tactics to rout them , including a 2007 city @entity185 initiative that sent inspectors with hand - held computers to map infestations in a @entity191 neighborhood and then followed up with owners to address the problems			2
recently , the @entity194 agreed to let an @entity196 - based company test a form of rat birth control by setting out bait in some subway stations this summer			1
but the terrier forays are an unofficial undertaking , and participants say they 're less about killing rats than giving dogs the experience of chasing them			1
the @entity185 declined to comment on the hunts			2
the idea has a long history			0
a noted 1851 examination of working - class life in @entity213 describes rat - catchers working the city 's streets with ferrets and terriers			1
more recently , a rat - catching dachshund got attention in @entity221 when its owner happened by while city councilman @entity223 was checking out a downtown cleanup program in 2010			1
@entity223 snapped a picture of the dog , rat in mouth , and posted the photo on his website			0
there 's even an @entity112 dog breed called a rat terrier , though its origins lie on farms			1
rat - tracking recently became an official canine sport , called ‘ barn hunt			1
’ dogs get two minutes to sniff around a hay - bale maze and indicate where they smell a rat concealed in a crush - proof , aerated tube ; the dog never catches the quarry			2
dozens of dogs competed in the first trials this past month in @entity250 , @entity251 @entity253 work : dogs taking part in the urban hunts sometimes get stuck in waste bins , fall into holes or walk away with scrapes backlash : @entity261 has expressed outrage after learning of the rat hunts , calling the practice ' a twisted blood sport masquerading as rodent control ' catch of the day : the dogs tracked down dispatched 13 rats within about a half - hour while dog owners may see it as time - honored pursuit , rat - hunting riles animal - rights advocates			1
@entity261 , which opposes hunting in general , expressed outrage after video of a dog snatching rats in a @entity42 park surfaced online two years ago			1
@entity261 spokesman @entity279 calls the alley rat quests ‘ a twisted blood sport masquerading as rodent control			1
’ @entity78 counters that ‘ there are lots of worse things that people do to rats , ’ noting that poisons can sicken the animals for hours			2
as for the dogs , they have sometimes gotten stuck in waste bins or tumbled into holes , and a recent night left two with scrapes			0
but @entity78 says none has ever been seriously hurt or fallen ill. in one recent foray , the dogs dispatched 13 rats within about a half - hour			1
the dogs prowled and prodded for about 90 more minutes before the group gave up for the night			0
but not to worry , said dachshund owner @entity301			2
‘ there will always be a million rats in the naked city			0
