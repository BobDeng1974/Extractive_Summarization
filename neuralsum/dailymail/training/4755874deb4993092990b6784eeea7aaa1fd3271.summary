by @entity0 @entity1 : 06:00 est , 24 december 2013 @entity2 : 07:32 est , 24 december 2013 @entity5 ’s @entity4 probe has provided some holidays treats from the outer solar system just in time for @entity8			0
the bus - sized orbiter has unveiled new images of @entity12 and two of its most fascinating moons , @entity15 and @entity16 , taken earlier this year			1
@entity12 resembles an ornament in one image , with a jet stream swirling at its north pole along with a hurricane - like storm			1
the globe of @entity12 resembles a holiday ornament in a wide - angle image overlooking its north pole , bringing into view the hexagonal jet stream and rapidly spinning polar vortex that reside there @entity4 also peered through the hazy atmosphere of @entity12 's largest moon , @entity15 , revealing hydrocarbon lakes			1
two views of @entity16 are included and highlight the many fissures , fractures and ridges that decorate the icy moon 's surface			1
@entity16 is a white , glittering snowball of a moon , now famous for the nearly 100 springs , also known as geysers , that are spread across its south polar region and spout tiny icy particles into space			0
most of these particles fall back to the surface as snow			0
some small fraction escapes the gravity of @entity16 and makes its way into orbit around @entity12 , forming the planet 's extensive and diffuse e ring			2
a dynamic interplay between @entity12 's largest moon , @entity15 , and its rings is captured in this view from @entity5 's @entity4 spacecraft			1
@entity15 's hazy atmosphere and surface environment are believed to be similar in certain respects to the early atmosphere of @entity65 winter is approaching in the southern hemisphere of @entity12 and with this cold season has come the familiar blue hue that was present in the northern winter hemisphere at the start of the @entity4 mission launched in 1997 , @entity4 has been exploring @entity12 and its series of moons since 2004			1
on @entity12 , a full year is the equivalent to 30 @entity65 years , meaning @entity4 has only been able to observe a third of a @entity12 year			2
since 2004 , @entity12 and its moons have seen the seasons change from northern winter to northern summer			0
@entity4 has studied the planet and its many natural satellites since arriving there in 2004 , also observing @entity82 , the heliosphere , and testing the theory of relativity			0
@entity4 is the fourth space probe to visit @entity12 and the first to enter orbit , and its mission is on going as of 2013			2
because scientists believe these geysers are directly connected to a subsurface , salty , organic - rich , liquid - water reservoir , @entity16 is home to one of the most accessible extraterrestrial habitable zones in the solar system			0
along with @entity12 and @entity16 is a group of natural - colour images of @entity12 's largest moon , @entity15 , highlighting two of @entity15 's most outstanding features			1
peering through the moon 's hazy , orange atmosphere , the @entity4 narrow - angle camera spots dark , splotchy features in the polar regions of the moon			2
these features are the lakes and seas of liquid methane and ethane for which the moon is renowned			0
@entity15 is the only other place in the solar system that we know has stable liquids on its surface , though in @entity15 's case , the liquids are ethane and methane rather than water			0
at @entity15 's south pole , a swirling high - altitude vortex stands out distinctly against the darkness of the moon 's un-illuminated atmosphere			2
using a special spectral filter , the high - resolution camera aboard the @entity4 spacecraft was able to peer through the hazy atmosphere of @entity12 's @entity15 a still and partially sunlit @entity16 is pictured here			1
@entity16 is a white , glittering snowball of a moon , now famous for the nearly 100 springs , also known as geysers , that are spread across its south polar region and spout tiny icy particles into space @entity15 's hazy atmosphere and surface environment are believed to be similar in certain respects to the early atmosphere of @entity65			1
but the planet that towers over these moons is a celestial wonder itself			0
the north and south poles of @entity12 are highlighted and appear drastically different from each other , as seen in new natural - color views			0
the globe of @entity12 resembles a holiday ornament in a wide - angle image overlooking its north pole , bringing into view the hexagonal jet stream and rapidly spinning polar vortex that reside there			1
and the planet 's south pole , now in winter , looking very different than the springtime north , displays brilliant blue hues , reminiscent of a frosty winter wonderland			0
@entity12 's moon @entity16 , covered in snow and ice , resembles a perfectly packed snowball in this image ‘ until @entity4 arrived at @entity12 , we did n't know about the hydrocarbon lakes of @entity15 , the active drama of @entity16 ' jets , and the intricate patterns at @entity12 's poles , ’ said @entity168 , the @entity4 project scientist			1
‘ spectacular images like these highlight that @entity4 has given us the gift of knowledge , which we have been so excited to share with everyone			0
’ launched in 1997 , @entity4 has explored the @entity12 system for more than nine years			2
@entity5 plans to continue the mission through 2017 , with the anticipation of much more incredible science and imagery to come			0
@entity12 's largest and second largest moons , @entity15 and @entity186 , appear to be stacked on top of each other in this true - color scene from the @entity4 spacecraft			1

the images were taken earlier this year by the bus - sized orbiter
@entity12 resembles an ornament in one image with a jet stream at its pole
the hazy atmosphere of @entity15 is shown revealing its hydrocarbon lakes
two views of @entity16 are included highlighting its fractures and ridges
launched in 1997 , @entity4 will continue to explore the planet until 2017
