by @entity0 last updated at 12:40 pm on 9th july 2011 he 's one of our greatest stars , a @entity4 and @entity5 winner whose movies have made millions worldwide			1
when he appeared as the adorably self - deprecating lead in @entity9 17 years ago , @entity7 fell in love with him			1
with subsequent hits such as @entity13 and @entity14 under his belt , you would have thought @entity17 might be enjoying the laurels of success and have found contentment now he 's 50			2
this week , as he toured tv stations fulminating self - righteously over the phone - hacking scandal , he came across as someone who is utterly embittered and jaundiced with life			1
seen here on @entity26 , @entity17 has toured tv stations fulminating self - righteously over the phone - hacking scandal of course , we are all appalled by the @entity31 's illegal activities , particularly the sickening evidence that the newspaper tampered with @entity35 's mobile after she had disappeared			1
but the relish with which @entity17 is dancing on the grave of a newspaper with a 168 - year history , which despite its smut can be proud of many fine and important investigations into corruption , does n't do him justice			1
the death of any paper diminishes our democracy , but then have you noticed that the most vociferous critics of the @entity50 are invariably those whose rackety private lives have been exposed by it ? step forward that buffoon @entity54 , whose long and lurid affair with his secretary @entity56 abused the high office he held			1
and , inevitably , the former chief of the world 's motor - racing federation , @entity58 , who 's best known for indulging in spanking and sex sessions with prostitutes dressed in @entity65 uniforms			1
how gleefully they now denounce the newspaper that exposed them			0
meanwhile , @entity70 's lying former communications chief , @entity69 , who sexed up the case for the disastrous war in @entity73 , has been just as vociferous			1
but what 's really puzzling is the hatred mr @entity17 feels for the @entity76 , which arguably gave him the publicity over the years and created the fanbase that enabled him to earn such vast sums			2
is it possible that his antipathy goes back to the revelations of that night in 1995 when @entity84 police found him receiving oral sex from hooker @entity86 ? i hope not			1
mr @entity17 should be above that			0
@entity89 : risque flights of fantasy in her latest turkey , @entity92 , @entity89 plays a sex - mad dentist			1
' i loved the script			0
i thought it was an extremely unique idea that everybody universally would be able to relate to , having a boss that 's a little bit difficult			2
' i do n't know which offices she 's ever worked in , but i 've never had a boss try to seduce me semi-naked , bra-less with stockings and suspenders			2
mps and members of the @entity109 women 's world cup football team have put pressure on the @entity111 to change its prime - time schedules today to show their quarter - final clash with @entity114			1
so let me say , as a member of their sex , that despite their dedication and skill , women footballers have about as much spectator appeal as a transsexual angling competition			0
i 'd change my mind if anyone i knew could name a single player in the side			2
perhaps the greatest hypocrite of all is @entity129 leader @entity128			2
while calling for the @entity130 to apologise for appointing @entity131 — who was arrested yesterday — his own director of communications , @entity133 , has been accused of being involved in ' a number of infringements of the law '			1
these allegations by former @entity139 treasurer @entity138 involve accessing private bank accounts while he was on the @entity141			0
@entity128 said he asked @entity133 , who , incidentally , is said to have snorted cocaine , if there was anything in his past that should prevent him taking the job			2
he gave him his word there was not			0
that 's just what @entity150 asked @entity131			0
how sickening that the world 's first @entity153 lottery to ' win a baby ' is to be launched in @entity7			1
anyone can win — man , woman , single , gay — and get £ 25,000 worth of free @entity153 treatment			2
when every piece of research confirms that children from single - parent homes are disadvantaged in all kinds of way , trivialising parenthood in this way is morally indefensible			0
@entity169 : sad goodbyes as the curtain falls on the final @entity174 movie , the delectable @entity171 seems to be constantly in floods of tears			0
the actress says she is in the middle of a ' grieving process ' at being separated from her film character , @entity180			0
or is she just grieving for the @entity174 cash cow that has amassed her a £ 24 million fortune ? and while we 're on fortunes , with all her billions you 'd have thought @entity187 could have turned up on the red carpet for her finale hurrah in a dress that did n't look as though she 'd been dragged backwards though a clump of peonies in full flower			1
with only days to go before she has her baby girl by caesarean section , @entity194 says she 's not one of those celebrities who wants to be photographed like @entity199 on a @entity201 cover with her naked bump			0
instead , her naked bump is ' secretly ' snapped by hubby @entity203 and the photographs are posted online			0
at this rate we 'll be treated to a video of the birth on @entity208			0
it was reported that @entity210 whispered to a male friend during a charity ball : ' i know what all the headlines will be tomorrow			0
who is the @entity218 's mystery date ? ' a word of advice , @entity210 : no one thinks of you as a ' duchess ' any more — just a pathetic , publicity - seeking , disgraced former royal			1
equally , no one could care less about who has the misfortune of squiring a dumpy , middle - aged woman who possesses not one iota of self - knowledge			0
a company investigating people 's attitudes towards domestic appliances reports the dishwasher is the least trusted			0
rubbish ! it 's not the dishwasher that 's the problem — rather our partners who do n't know how to stack them properly .			1

number 10 has secret plans to dispatch the *treacherous* @entity129 - leaning *speaker* @entity243 to @entity244 as part of a *parliamentary* exchange . @entity243 in a **burkah** — i 'd *pay* good money to witness that , especially since **burkah** - clad @entity244 women are not expected to be seen or heard .
home secretary @entity253 plans a change to the law to stop *criminals* using their ' right to a family life ' under the @entity258 to prevent them being *deported* . one @entity259 used the fact he owns a @entity7 cat as part of his successful case that he should be allowed to stay here . let 's hope this latest promise of *reform* is n't as empty as the pm 's *vow* to scrap the *reviled* @entity258 and *replace* it with a @entity7 @entity269 .
*effete* and *ineffectual* *multi-millionaire* @entity271 *attacks* the @entity273 *empire* run by @entity274 and his *son* @entity275 as being too powerful . that 's pretty rich coming from a former *non-dom* who *inherited* £ 200 million to £ *300* million from his *billionaire* father — who incidentally also hated the @entity50 — and has never *achieved* anything in life off his own back .
