by @entity0 @entity1 , with his wife @entity2 , and @entity3 have signed up to be frozen after their death they were a shattered world ’s last hope — three great minds from the past who might be able to avert a catastrophe that threatened to extinguish mankind			1
in a medical storage facility in the @entity18 desert , digital screens that had been dark for centuries suddenly flickered into life as the remains of three beings stirred into life after aeons of slumber			2
it ’s difficult to say whether this sort of @entity28 sci - fi scenario ever occurred to three @entity30 dons when they signed up to be frozen after death			1
but what they can not deny is that along with thousands of others they are putting their faith in a future — known as cryonics — that is more science fiction than science fact			2
it was revealed yesterday that the trio — @entity43 , professor of philosophy at @entity30 ’s @entity46 , and his fellow lead researchers , @entity3 and @entity1 — have agreed to pay a @entity49 company anything up to £ 50,000 to have their remains frozen at death			1
the hope is a future society will have the technology to restore them to life			2
@entity1 has arranged for his entire body to be frozen by the @entity60 - based @entity59			1
his wife is expecting their first baby and he is so enthused by the idea that he wants to sign the child up , too			2
his two colleagues have opted for the less glamorous but cheaper and supposedly more reliable option of having just their heads frozen when they are declared dead , by the @entity69 outside @entity70 , @entity18			1
their heads will be perfused with a cocktail of antifreeze chemicals and preserved in liquid nitrogen at -196c			1
professor of philosophy @entity43 ( right ) , and fellow researcher @entity3 ( left ) have signed up to pay an @entity49 company up to £ 50,000 to have their heads stored in liquid nitrogen after death previous acolytes of cryonics have often been dismissed as head - in - the - clouds cranks , sci - fi buffs who have watched too much tv or victims of vanity			1
@entity87 and @entity88 have both waxed lyrical about being frozen			1
@entity89 is believed to be among several dozen @entity90 who have joined a cryonics programme , although several hundred have reportedly shown interest			2
but most of them are ordinary people — usually retirees who are thinking about defeating death			1
the science may be sketchy but the principle is simple : nothing ventured , nothing gained			2
but prof @entity43 and his colleagues are young , highly educated specialists who have devoted their careers to humanity			1
if they are signing up for cryonics , one might think , perhaps we should all pay attention			0
@entity1 , a colleague at the @entity46 ( @entity46 ) , part of the prestigious @entity112 , has opted to have his whole body frozen and while scientists generally dismiss cryonics for human beings , saying it is far beyond our capabilities , it is interesting that @entity120 has a science background that includes physics and neuroscience			1
the 40 - year - old @entity124 is on @entity126 ’s list of 100 @entity127			1
his institute is part of the @entity112 , where 300 academics tackle issues such as population growth , inequality and climate change			0
it ’s encouraging that , in the midst of so much doom - mongering about the future , he is keen to come back again			1
‘ look back at what has happened over the past 100 years , and how many features of today ’s world somebody from 1913 would have failed to anticipate , ’ he told a newspaper			0
‘ the more uncertain you are about the future , the more it makes sense to keep your options alive — for example , by trying to preserve as much as possible of the information content in your brain , rather than throwing it away			0
’ on his internet home page , @entity3 , 41 , also @entity124 , describes himself as ‘ questing ’ and ‘ always very happy ’			1
he says it will be ‘ very exciting ’ to wake up in a new world			0
admittedly , his life would be limited as a disembodied head but , in the future , he predicts people will be able to make ‘ real connections ’ to computers			0
he hopes his memories and personality could be downloaded			0
he and @entity43 may not even have to put up with living with just their heads : some cryonics devotees insist future science will be able to clone human bodies so the defrosted , severed head can be attached to a new body			1
their colleague , @entity1 , says it costs him £ 25 a month in premiums to cover the cost of having his body cryopreserved — far cheaper , he says , than the popular alternative of prolonging life , which is to join a gym			1
like his colleagues , he seems one of life ’s optimists : ‘ if you picture the world in , say , 200 years , when reanimation is possible , it will probably be a wonderful place			0
’ by the time they are rushed down to the liquid nitrogen tanks of @entity69 , the @entity30 academics will be in illustrious company			0
@entity69 has 117 patients already in cryopreservation and 985 members waiting to join them			0
those already lying in state include @entity196 , one of the greatest stars of baseball , who died in 2002			0
and @entity199 , a @entity49 tv sitcom writer , has been there since 1988 following his death from @entity202			1
prof @entity43 and dr @entity3 have agreed to be frozen with the help of @entity69 , which is based near @entity70 , in @entity18 @entity196 became the focus of a family row over how he wanted his body disposed of which focused on the authenticity of a note in which he supposedly chose cryonics			1
it was later claimed that a technician at @entity69 took baseball - style swings at @entity196 ’ severed head with a monkey wrench			1
as for those still alive but already committed to @entity69 , the list includes film director @entity220 and @entity90 thinkers @entity221 and @entity223			0
recognisable by a silver bracelet they usually wear to specify their wishes to be frozen when they die , believers in @entity90 even have a support group : cryonics @entity90			1
@entity230 , 75 , a retired electronics expert from @entity231 , has been a leading light in @entity90 cryonics since the mid-eighties			0
a few weeks ago his wife , @entity235 , became the first @entity236 to be properly cryonically preserved			2
she died of lung cancer after an illness of just three weeks , and was rushed to the @entity59 in @entity49			0
with the possibility on his mind of a reunion with his beloved wife of 40 years , he tells me scientific progress has led @entity90 interest in cryonics to ‘ mushroom ’ in the past five years			0
but he says : ‘ there would n’t be any point bringing back a 90 - year - old			2
’ who would n’t be interested in having a good few years added to their lives , i observe			0
is n’t the difference that most people want them now when their loved ones are still with them ? dr. @entity259 , president and ceo of @entity69 , stands in the @entity261 where the heads and bodies of 49 individuals are being held in cold storage suspension ‘ i do n’t see that as a problem , ’ says @entity230			2
‘ what happens when you leave school and move to @entity271			0
we move to completely alien environments all the time			0
’ but will a future world want to bring back people who have opted to be frozen ? when @entity89 dropped his cryonics plan bombshell at a @entity281 party , his host , @entity276 , reportedly pointed out he was n’t sure if his reanimation would be so popular			2
prof @entity43 is already a regular on tv and in the media			1
a future society would doubtless be intrigued to know what an academic of his standing has to say about its world			0
but what about an ex-housewife or former electrical technician ? ‘ that ’s the biggest problem , ’ says @entity230			0
‘ why would anyone bring me back ? ’ cryonics patients wo n’t have much novelty value when there are millions of them			0
indeed , the cryonics companies do n’t really guarantee much			0
success depends on the body first getting to them in the @entity49 as quickly as possible			2
and although their freezing fee — which varies between £ 16,500 and £ 125,000 — is supposed to cover an indefinite period , who is to know the company will stay in business ? it is a ‘ leap of faith , but a leap of faith in science ’ , @entity230 insists			2
‘ unless we want to go into oblivion , this is the only scientific means i know of to avoid it			0
’ for people like him and his fellow death - defiers at @entity30 , there can be no possible concession to the idea that oblivion may be something to be embraced .			1

@entity43 , @entity3 , @entity1 to be frozen after death
two will just have heads frozen and one will have whole body preserved
the after - death *procedure* costs anything up to £ 50,000
