the actress @entity9 was in the public gallery to see @entity11 sentenced , as he sat wearing an ivory - colored robe and skull cap with his hands clasped in front of him			1
the judges found @entity11 guilty of kidnaping youngsters from their families and using them as soldiers 2002 - 2003 in the armed wing of his political movement , the @entity24			1

@entity2 militia chief @entity11 smiles and shakes the hand of a member of his legal team in the @entity7 in the @entity8 before his conviction today @entity9 , pictured at her @entity33 hotel today , was int he public gallery at the @entity8 to see @entity11 sentenced ms @entity9 was thrilled with the verdict			1
she said afterwards : ' this is their day - where these children will feel there is no impunity for what happened to them , for what they suffered			1
' presiding judge @entity46 said : ' the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that mr. @entity11 is guilty of the crimes of conscripting and enlisting children under the age of 15 years and using them to participate actively in hostilities			1
' as he left court flanked by guards , @entity11 nodded and smiled to supporters in the public gallery			1
a sentencing hearing will now be scheduled			1
he faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment			2
while the three - judge panel unanimously convicted @entity11 , it also harshly criticised prosecutors as ' negligent ' for using intermediaries to deal with witnesses in @entity2			2
@entity46 said three intermediaries ' persuaded , encouraged or assisted witnesses to give false evidence ' and scrapped the evidence of three witnesses			2
' the prosecutor 's office must review its limited investigation strategy adopted in the @entity11 case , especially in light of such decisions precluding victims from participating in trials and obtaining reparation , ' said @entity78 of @entity79			2
' lessons need to be learned for future cases			2
' @entity79 also criticised the court for not charging @entity11 with sexual violence crimes , saying the decision potentially denied ' justice and reparation to many more victims			0
' however , other witnesses and video of @entity11 speaking to recruits , some of them children , at a training camp provided enough evidence to convict him			0
prosecutors said @entity11 recruited the children fight in a brutal ethnic conflict in the @entity98 of eastern @entity2			0
under armed guard : @entity11 during a rally in the @entity2 in 2003 , left , and @entity101 , right , one of the young combatants recruited to fight for the rebel @entity24 for @entity2 @entity103 , also pictured in 2003 the trial , which began in january 2009 , is the first at an international court to focus exclusively on the use of child soldiers and activists say it should send a clear message to armies and rebels around the world that conscripting children breaches international law			0
the @entity116 estimates tens of thousands of child soldiers are still fighting in conflicts from @entity118 to @entity119 and @entity120			0
' the guilty verdict against @entity11 is a strong warning to military commanders in @entity2 and elsewhere - using children as a weapon of war is a serious crime that can lead them to the dock , ' said @entity130 of @entity131			0
the first verdict is a coming of age for the court set up to prosecute war crimes suspects in countries unable or unwilling to try them			0
child fighter : another young recruit for the @entity24 in the @entity2 town of @entity141 is watched by a @entity116 armoured personnel carrier so far , prosecutors have opened seven investigations and have just five suspects in custody , including former @entity148 president @entity147 and former congo vice president @entity149			0
however , questions still remain about the its effectiveness			0
the court has no police force to arrest suspects and can only launch investigations in the 120 countries that recognise its jurisdiction , or if the @entity160 orders a probe			0
that means that the court is powerless to intervene in the bloody conflict tearing @entity164 apart because @entity165 has not recognised the court and the @entity160 is bitterly divided			0
the inability of the court to have suspects arrested turned into a global online sensation last week with the release of the @entity170 video by @entity172 activists , which highlighted the case of notorious @entity175 rebel @entity174 , the first person indicted by the court who remains a fugitive more than six years later .			1
