if @entity1 fans at the @entity2 on sunday want a reminder of why they do not compete for titles any more they need only cast a glimpse at the home side 's dugout			1
because sat there , barring a surprise selection from @entity10 , will be a living , breathing symbol of their club 's fall from heavyweights to makeweights			2
warming himself against the @entity21 cold , @entity18 will probably be spending another 90 minutes kicking his heels as the immovable @entity23 goes about his business			1
@entity18 moved to @entity25 from @entity1 on a free transfer last summer @entity18 ( centre ) has largely found himself sat on the @entity25 bench , like here again @entity30 in october the @entity31 ( left ) , playing for @entity1 , attempts to tackle former @entity25 player @entity32 in january 2013 at this stage last season @entity18 , regarded as one of the finest full backs in the country , had played 26 times for the @entity38			1
this year he has featured in 11 matches for @entity25 , which include just five starts in the @entity41 - almost as many appearances at the @entity2 as his wife , @entity43 , has made judging by her @entity46 and @entity47 accounts			1
from ever - present to ever - ready			2
will he be surprised ? he should not be			0
will he be upset ? who knows ? @entity18 's wife , @entity43 , has made almost as many appearances at the @entity2 this season as the @entity31 @entity52 ( second left ) posted this picture of herself with friends at the @entity2 earlier this season @entity18 and @entity56 enjoy a day on the beach during the @entity58 in @entity59 last summer if he is ever feeling down he need only take a look at his monthly salary and the position of his team in the table			1
money talks in football and @entity25 have more of it than @entity1			1
when he completed his move , @entity18 slammed those who claimed it was only for the cash before pointing out that , by the way , he had n't had a pay rise at the @entity74 in six years			1
' i need a boost in my career , ' he said			0
city were happy to offer a 31 - year - old a three - year contract of a reported £ 150,000 - a - week			0
@entity18 ( left ) heads the ball clear during @entity25 's @entity83 third - round victory over @entity84 @entity18 holds his shirt over his face in dejection during @entity1 's match at @entity89 in march 2014 that is one of the reasons why @entity10 's side are vying with @entity94 for the title and why @entity97 's men , once again , will be content with a top - four spot			1
it may not all be about the money			0
@entity18 will know that if he can muster 10 appearances in the @entity41 he will be in with a chance of picking up a winners ' medal			2
@entity23 has had his injury issues in the past but the warrior - like defender , who turned 30 this week , appears to be in fine nick			2
as for the @entity110 , it is an even grimmer situation			0
the arrival of @entity112 means that one of @entity25 's registered players is going to have to make way and the smart money is on @entity18			1
the @entity31 ( right ) tackles @entity117 of @entity84 on january 4 @entity18 ( right ) celebrates with @entity118 after scoring for @entity1 against @entity89 in september 2013 a sad , sad state of affairs			1
lest we forget @entity18 is not the first			2
following the arrival of @entity124 , @entity122 forged a path north			0
it soon became well - trodden , with @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 following his lead			0
city know that to succeed at the highest level , you have to spend and spend big			0
@entity10 , before he had even started in @entity134 , knew that to sustain a serious title challenge he needed two quality players vying for each position			2
does @entity97 , closing in on 18 years on these shores , agree ? if he does he has a funny way of showing it			0
@entity18 lifts the @entity83 trophy above his head after @entity1 's triumph at @entity144 last may nobody should deny @entity97 's achievements and what he has done for the club			1
winning with guile soon became winning with style			0
they should name the stadium his dealings pretty much paid for after him and cast the bronze for his statue			0
maybe @entity97 will master his own @entity31 revolution			0
while splashing the cash on @entity159 was a start , @entity157 has been a revelation			0
and nobody could predict that @entity18 's replacement , @entity164 , would be out for three months , come back for one game and then get injured and be out for another three months			2
but the weak points go beyond right back and , while he may yet prove people wrong this window , the manager appears to be too stubborn to address them			0
@entity1 boss @entity97 celebrates by grabbing @entity18 's head and embracing him after the @entity83 final fans scream for a central defender and on friday he goes out and pays £ 4.2million for a 17 - year - old @entity176 midfielder with six appearances under his belt			1
last season , when they came to @entity21 top of the league , @entity25 hit them for six			1
are @entity1 any better this time around ? at some point during proceedings there is little doubt the @entity2 faithful will launch into a chant reminding the visitors that they are now their feeder club			2
while it will be sung with @entity194 tongues planted firmly in cheeks , the sad fact of the matter is that they are not far wrong			0
@entity18 ( right ) in action for @entity1 against @entity89 during the 2013 - 14 @entity41 season			1

@entity25 host @entity1 at the @entity2 on sunday ( *4pm* kick - off )
@entity18 is likely to be sat in the home dugout during the match
he is @entity23 's *understudy* after leaving @entity38 last season
@entity25 can afford to have two world - class players in every single position
@entity1 did not give @entity18 a pay rise in six years at the @entity74
*gunners* are top - four contenders while @entity25 are title challengers
