by @entity0 published : 14:38 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 04:05 est , 13 november 2013 gliding across 95 feet of smooth white , @entity1 looks like he 's snowboarding down a towering mountain			1
but rather than landing on a sludgy pile of ice and muddy snow , he hops gleefully onto the sun - soaked beach of northern @entity10			1
a keen surfer who relishes a challenge , @entity11 - based mr @entity1 has ventured to @entity14 , famed for its enormous waves			1
after the waves break , a bright white blanket covers the water - making it look like a ski slope			1
@entity21 : @entity11 - based @entity1 rides the whitewater in @entity14 in @entity10			1
the huge walls of water look more like a mountain than the sea control : the conditions are incredibly dangerous for surfers , requiring the utmost control			2
waves this size require the riders to be towed - in using jet - skis when @entity37 's storm battered its way across @entity39 , huge waves battered @entity10			1
surfers flocked to @entity14 after monitoring weather data before the storm but the biggest waves created by the storm actually hit overnight before sunrise			1
@entity39 surfer @entity46 was among the surfers riding the storm			0
he said he could hear the waves pounding the shoreline overnight from inside the beach house he is staying in , saying the monster swells were even making the walls shake			0
mr @entity46 and his team were in the water before light at 6am , along with scores of other surfers all tried to ride the biggest wave			0
height does not make a wave more deadly - it is the force of the shallow currents that thrill - seekers have to worry about			0
risky : it is notoriously difficult to stand at full height - with hands in the air no less - one a wave this tall			2
but mr @entity1 , who has trained for years , felt confident @entity67 : to get the force and strength to turn into the wave , mr @entity1 bends to touch his board as the sea slowly becomes engulfed in white foam but it brings its own challenges			1
judging when to stand up to catch it in its prime is not as clear - cut as shorter waves			2
and as surfers make their way down , they need stamina to control the board as they twist and turn for longer than usual			0
photojournalist @entity85 from @entity14 , @entity10 , captured the moment as mr @entity1 powered through the @entity10 sea			1
a huge wall of white water coated the sea in his images as a wave crashed into water at least one - and - a - half times its depth			1
the 41 - year - old said : ' the sea on the day was incredibly rough , which was great for the surfers because their job is to catch huge waves all over the world			2
' every wave is incredibly dangerous , and each wave was around 30 metres tall - i just can just imagine how the surfers feel in the water			2
' despite the roughness of the sea , we can see how elegant the surfers are in the tough conditions			0
ease : he glides towards the bottom after a comparatively smooth ride			0
later , he went on to tackle waves almost entirely made up of bustling foam ' when you are watching the surfers , you appreaciate the beauty of what they are doing , but it is quite stressful due to the risk involved			0
' the waves were between 20 and 30 metres tall and were so loud and frequent - there was a constant sound			2
' mr @entity85 loves the photographs because of the fantastic swirls that were created by the ferocious wave			0
he added : ' i love everything that is in the photographs			0
' i love the swirls of the wave and when you first look , it looks like you can see a snowboarder on thick white snow			0

@entity1 tackled 90ft - tall waves in @entity14 on the northern coast of @entity10
waves break in *1.5* times their own depth often forcing them to *crumble* out to sea creating a wall of white water
