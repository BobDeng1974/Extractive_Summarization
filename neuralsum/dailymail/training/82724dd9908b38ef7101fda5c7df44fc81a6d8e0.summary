by @entity0 the family of an accounts manager who died when a branch fell on her during a three - year - old 's birthday party have called on more research to stop people dying in similar circumstances @entity8 from @entity9 , west @entity10 , was strolling through the picturesque @entity11 , @entity12 , south west @entity10 , in september 2012 when she was hit by part of a @entity15 tree			1
after the inquest into the 31 - year - old 's tragic death , her parents @entity16 and @entity18 paid tribute to their ' darling daughter ' but called for more time to be spent analysing the risks of @entity25 to save lives in the future			1
however , after the verdict of accidental death was recorded at @entity32 , staff at the gardens refuted the claim , insisting her death was a ' terrible freak accident '			1
action needed : the family of @entity38 , 31 , have demanded ' urgent research ' into the risks associated with @entity25 after she was hit by a falling branch at @entity11 in @entity12 ( right ) outside the court , @entity42 read out a statement on behalf of ms @entity8 's parents			1
in it they said : ' first , we would like to thank the jury for the time and consideration they have given to their considerations			2
' second , the loss of our darling daughter , @entity55 , shattered us as a family			1
our memories of her are particularly vivid today , as the circumstances surrounding her death are brought to the fore			2
' our thoughts are not only with @entity64 but our hearts go out to all the families that have lost loved ones in similar circumstances			2
' she was at @entity11 to celebrate the birthday of her friend @entity72 ’s daughter @entity72 , and an inquest heard it was pure ' fluke ' that they too were not killed in the tragedy			1
they have faced questions over the safety of its trees and whether it could have prevented the tragedy			2
@entity83 , director of horticulture , insisted that everything possible is done to ensure the safety of visitors to the gardens			0
speaking after the inquest , he said : ' the jury has found that there was no identifiable cause of branch failure from this tree that caused this tragic accident			0
memories : the parents of the accounts manager from @entity98 said their daughter 's death had ' shattered ' the family ' we of course continue to extend our greatest sympathies of the family and friends of ms @entity8			1
' he dismissed calls for fencing to be put in place warning against summer branch drop , saying it would be ' inappropriate to place warning signs because it is such an unlikely thing to happen and it is so unforeseeable			0
' @entity112 , representing ms @entity8 ’s family , said it had been raining heavily in the hours leading up to the accident on september 23			1
tree branches are vulnerable to dropping off suddenly when they endure long dry spells followed by heavy rain in a condition known as ' @entity25 '			1
mr @entity121 said @entity11 failed to put up signs warning of the danger because it deemed the risk so minimal , and questioned why it had not fenced trees off			0
but @entity128 , a lawyer representing @entity129 , said the death was a ' terrible freak accident '			2
after just 45 minutes of deliberation , the jury of four men and three women returned a verdict of accidental death			1
the foreman told the court the jury found ' there is insufficient evidence to establish the cause of the branch failure '			0
defence : a lawyer representing @entity11 claimed her death was a ' terrible freak accident ' ms @entity8 was walking along a path in when ms @entity72 suddenly noticed a large @entity15 branch , 20ft ( 6m ) long and 12in ( 31cm ) thick , was crashing down from 66ft ( 20m ) above			1
ms @entity72 screamed ' run ' and fled for her life , but when she looked back she saw @entity98 - born ms @entity8 lying face - down on the ground surrounded by debris from the tree			1
ms @entity72 had earlier told the four - day inquest that she heard a ' crack like lightning ' and saw the thick branch fall			1
she said : ' it blocked out the sky and all i could see was this umbrella of branches			0
' as i was running i thought the whole tree was falling over			0
i was sure it was going to hit me			0
i was running away and then i heard a heavy thud			2
' argument : staff at the picturesque gardens refuted claims it was @entity25 because of heavy rain before the incident she spun around to see her friend motionless with blood coming out of her mouth and ears			1
the branch fell with such force that it brought two others down in its wake and smashed ms @entity8 ’s backpack , making ' sawdust ' of the glass inside			1
ms @entity72 said her young daughter had run ahead to walk with her aunt just moments earlier - but was in floods of tears at the sight			2
she said : ' because they had stopped and seen everything , my three year - old was really upset and crying so she went on with her auntie			1
' paramedics rushed to the scene , but ms @entity8 was pronounced dead at 2.51pm - after 45 minutes of cardiac resuscitation			1
experts at the @entity203 , which is home to the world ’s largest collection of living plants , said the tree had no sign of decay and was regularly inspected			0
@entity211 , head of arboretum at @entity129 , blamed the branch fall on a heavy downpour - 0.2in ( 5mm ) of rain had fallen in the hour before the accident - and strong winds			2
he said : ' i think the branch deluge was triggered by a wind squall			0
if we say that the wind gusted at 30mph , that would be strong enough to move branches			0
' he dismissed suggestions that summer branch drop caused the accident , pointing out that it had been the wettest summer since records began and it happened later in the year			2
he said @entity129 did all it could to care for the tree and that warning signs would have been an over-reaction			0
but @entity235 , a tree expert called by the family , branded @entity129 ’s system of tree inspection ' a shambles ' and said ' this is definitely a case of @entity25 '			1
he said the death could have been avoided if the tree , which was planted in 1730 , had been pruned			2
assistant coroner @entity244 said the death was a ' ghastly accident ' but she would not be making a @entity248 report			2
mr @entity112 said ms @entity8 ’s family wanted more to be done to raise awareness of the ' insidious danger ' of summer branch drop			1
trees tend to shed their branches during a heatwave because they struggle to absorb water into their roots			0
even though the causes of @entity25 are not entirely clear , it is believed to be a common problem with trees that have longer limbs			1
there is often a warning sign before a branch comes down which is said to sound like a ' sharp crack not unlike the sound of a shotgun going off '			0
@entity269 , who is a technical officer with the @entity270 , told the website @entity272 : ' certainly there ’s a clear relationship between the weather conditions and the frequency of summer branch drop			0
' it ’s notoriously unpredictable so it ’s very difficult from a tree owner ’s point of view to meet their duty of care			0
' many trees throughout the country will show signs of ' stress ' during periods of high temperatures , with their leaves turning yellow and even falling off			0
while this might look like the tree is dying , it was a mechanism the tree uses to defend itself			0
trees will shed leaves and sometimes branches so there is less surface area for water to be lost			0
a number of ways to combat tree branches dropping in heavily built up areas include watering them more often			0
however it is hard to distinguish how much water one tree needs and how often they should be watered			0
in 2011 , a 13 - year - old girl died in a @entity311 park after a branch fell on her head			1
@entity314 was with friends at a recreation ground in @entity317 while teachers at her school were on strike .			0

@entity8 , 31 , from west @entity10 died during a three - year - old 's birthday
parents @entity16 and @entity18 family said her death ' shattered ' them
@entity328 heard it was pure ' fluke ' others were *n't* killed
a verdict of accidental death was recorded even though family suggest it was a result of @entity25
