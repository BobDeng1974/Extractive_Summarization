@entity11 doctors performed pseudo-scientific experiments on concentration camp inmates , including at @entity14			2
@entity14 prisoners : the @entity0 has admitted that many doctors under @entity3 - rule during the @entity7 were guilty of ' scores of human rights violations ' they were also key to the @entity3 's program of forced sterilisation or euthanasia of the mentally ill or others deemed ' unworthy of life '			1
in a statement made in @entity25 this week , the @entity11 medical association said ' these crimes were not the actions of individual doctors but involved leading members of the medical community '			2
the crimes should be taken as a warning for the future , it added			2
the doctors were ' guilty , contrary to their mission to heal , of scores of human rights violations and we ask the forgiveness of their victims , living and deceased , and of their descendants '			1
perhaps the most notorious @entity3 doctor was @entity14 medic @entity42			1
known as the ' @entity43 ' , he consigned arrivals to the gas chambers and carried out appalling medical experiments on @entity4 , most of whom died in agony without anaesthetic			0
he escaped to @entity51 at the end of the war and for decades was the most wanted @entity3 war criminal			1
he died in 1979 after suffering a stroke while swimming			0
another infamous @entity3 doctor was dr @entity57 , the so - called ‘ @entity64 ’ , who would inject substances such as petrol , water or poison directly into his victims ’ hearts			1

notorious : nazi doctors @entity42 ( left ) , known as the ' @entity43 ' , and @entity57 ( right ) , the so - called ' @entity64 ' and in one notorious ‘ experiment ’ he castrated and decapitated a young athlete , before having the flesh boiled off his skull , to be used as a display piece			1
until 2008 , @entity57 ’s actions earned him a place as the most - wanted @entity3 war criminal still thought to be at large			1
but the 2009 discovery of a battered and rusting briefcase held in storage by the @entity80 hotel owner now indicates that the hunt may finally be over			0
it contained medical records showing that @entity57 suffered from rectal cancer , which eventually killed him in 1992			0
he is then thought to have been buried in an anonymous grave , although there are some who think the evidence is far from conclusive and that he may still be alive			0
@entity89 , author of @entity3 war criminal book @entity90 , said : ' @entity57 is one of the major criminals of the last century			2
' his experiments that he carried out on concentration camp victims were disgusting and he was currently being hunted for his crimes			0
' although @entity57 was captured in a general round - up of leading @entity96 by @entity98 forces in march 1945 , he was released because his name did not appear on any of the lists of war criminals the @entity102 had quickly drawn up			2
he became a gynaecologist in @entity104 until 1962 , when his past caught up with him in the form of the @entity108 police , who were finally investigating him for his war crimes			0
@entity57 was tipped off and he escaped , reportedly to @entity111 and then to @entity112 , where he opened up a gynaecological practice			0
