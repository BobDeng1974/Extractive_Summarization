@entity5 , from @entity6 in the @entity1 , says she had the ink , which also states she is over 91 , because she does not want emergency crews to bring her back to life if she stops breathing			1
despite ambulance services previously stating they would not accept the tattoo as valid , @entity1 health minister , @entity14 , has confirmed it is a legal declaration			1
@entity5 from the @entity1 said she had the tattoo because she does not want to be revived by medics the 15cm - wide body art will lawfully allow ms @entity5 the right to self determination to end her life - a complex issue in the @entity1 , which has an increasing population of elderly people			1

' we want the best possible implementation of euthanasia , especially for groups that do not get help in practice , such as people with dementia , chronic psychiatric patients and elderly people who feel that their life is complete , ' it says			2
@entity29 currently offers its members what it calls a ' not - resuscitate penning ' , which is essentially an id tag stating the person 's name , date of birth , a photograph and a signature on a necklace			0
it is a statement to a first - aider that the patient does not want to have cpr administrated on them , however , there has been issues in that medics have been unable to find them			0
the 15cm - wide tattoo across her chest , which reads ' do not resuscitate , i 'm 91 + ' , has now been accepted as a legal declaration as a right to die by the @entity1 health minister , @entity14 the idea of a tattoo was hoped to be a bolder statement after ms @entity5 said she did not trust the necklaces			1
she told a @entity1 newspaper : ' i 've seen on tv that it was a matter of seconds for ambulance staff - they really do n't look for a necklace			0
' i do not want to end up as a vegetable in a chair			0
' ms @entity5 had worked with ms @entity14 to try and make the statement tattoos a formal and legal declaration to medics - and she is not the only person to have one			1
in 2012 an 88 - year - old @entity1 woman had a similar tattoo done on her left breast to let her last wishes be known			2
