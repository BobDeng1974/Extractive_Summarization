inhaling the delicate bouquet of a glass of wine can leave most of us at a loss for words to describe what we are smelling			2
but it turns out it may be our language that is hampering our sense of smell			0
scientists have found that @entity12 speakers struggle to identify and describe odours compared to other languages			1
i 'm getting blackberries and thistles : the @entity12 language is not the best for describing odours say scientists researchers found those who use @entity12 as their first language can take five times as long to describe an odour than they can a colour			1
however , native speakers from the @entity28 tribe in @entity29 , @entity30 , described odours far more consistently and in less time than they can a colour			1
looking at someone who is overweight or obese can alter our sense of smell to make the scent of the world around us appear less pleasant , scientists have found			2
researchers discovered viewing images of fat people caused participants in a study to rate odour samples as smelling worse - even though they were actually fragrance free			0
the scientists believe the effect may be caused by inbuilt negative bias that many people have towards those who are overweight and obese			0
surprisingly they also found that those who had a higher @entity49 themselves tended to give the scent samples a lower rating			0
this suggests that people who have their own weight problems are perhaps also the harshest critics of others who are fat			0
the @entity28 have at least 12 specific abstract words that relate to smells while the @entity59 , a tribe of hunter gatherers in southern @entity61 , have 15 words			1
these abstract words describe smells in the same way as we use blue , red and yellow to describe colours			2
the findings suggest @entity12 speakers appear to have lost the ability to accurately describe smells			1
professor @entity74 , who led the work at the centre for language studies at @entity78 in @entity79 , in the @entity80 , said : ' our findings show that the long - held assumption that people are bad at naming smells is not universally true			1
' @entity85 are expressible in language , as long as you speak the right language			0
' professor @entity89 has found that the @entity12 language has few specific words that are capable of describing smells			1
one of the few that is used is the term ' musty ' , which describes a stuffy and dusty odour of an old book or room that has been unused for a long time			0
most of the time @entity12 speakers have to rely upon the source of the smell as a description - using words like fruity or lemon			1
in a study published in the journal @entity105 , professor @entity89 asked 10 @entity12 speakers and 10 native speakers of the @entity28 to describe colours and odours			1
they were presented with 12 odours , including cinnamon , turpentine , lemon , smoke , chocolate , rose , onion and gasoline , and 80 different colours			2
they found that when describing the odours , there was little agreement among @entity12 speakers when describing the odours			1
the @entity28 use 12 abstract words to describe odours ( shown , left ) in the same way they do colours ( right ) in many western societies , smell has become a largely under - used sense			1
in many cases odours have become something undesirable and to be avoided , according to professor @entity89 ( picture posed by a model ) they also used far longer descriptions when identifying the smells			2
for example when presented with a cinnamon odour , @entity12 speakers described it as spicy , sweet , candy , smoky , wine and pot pourri			1
however , the @entity28 were found to use a series of succinct terms to describe the smells , such words that mean to ' smell edible ' and ' to have a bloody smell that attracts tigers '			1
these works were predominantly abstract words , much like those they used for colour			2
however , while abstract words were dominant among the @entity12 speakers when describing colour , they used source based descriptions			1
in a later study in the journal of @entity105 , professor @entity89 and her colleagues looked at the language of the @entity59 , a 300 strong nomadic tribe in southern @entity61 , and found they use words for smell that have complex meanings			2
they wrote : ' smell is particularly important in the lives of the @entity59 , and lies at the core of the indigenous ideology			0
the table above shows the specific abstract words used by the @entity59 tribes to describe different odours ' the @entity59 surround themselves with odors believed to be beneficial for health and that repel danger			2
they stay constantly alert for potentially harmful odors			0
' the @entity59 system is remarkable because there are dedicated terms for olfaction and these are part of everyday talk			0
@entity192 languages simply lack this			0
when describing smells , @entity12 speakers , for example , most often resort to source - descriptors , such as like a banana or fruity , but even these descriptors are not applied accurately			1
' it is unclear exactly why @entity12 speakers have lost the ability to describe smells accurately , but vision has become the predominant sense in almost all human cultures			1
in a recent study published in the journal of @entity207 , professor @entity89 and her colleagues found that @entity12 speakers use specific words for vision and hearing but have few for the other senses like touch , smell and taste			1
there is a similar pattern in other western languages			0
however , smell plays a far greater role in the language of the @entity223 of @entity30 , for example			0
speaking to @entity225 , professor @entity89 said : ' there seems to be something culturally different too			0
' people in the @entity192 seem to do everything they can to get rid of smells , and in many contexts odour is a taboo topic			0
' this might be linked to changes in our smell environment since the industrial revolution			0
' if you read stories from the @entity242 or @entity243 from before the revolution , there 's sewage in the streets and people are using perfume to cover up body odour			0
' these days , we do everything we can to sanitise our environment			0

@entity12 speakers take five times longer to describe an odour than a colour
native @entity258 tribes like the @entity28 have at least 12 specific words for smells
@entity12 speakers tend to rely upon descriptive words like fruity or lemon
scientists at @entity78 in the @entity80 say western culture has made smell less important and in some cases something to be avoided
