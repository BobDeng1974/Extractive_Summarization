amid accusations that police dithered in the weeks after the beating , then - superintendent @entity29 retired and the department vowed to clean up its image			2
@entity9 police adhered to a strict code of silence protecting fellow officers as a federal jury awarded the $ 850,000 in damages @entity8 at her civil trial on tuesday			1
the civil trial in federal court in @entity9 was the first of its kind to focus almost wholly on the question of whether there is such an ingrained code - with most of the 2 1/2 weeks of testimony devoted to that question			1
but he said he never presented himself as an officer that night or asserted he had special off - duty privileges			1

testimony during his criminal trial suggested that he attacked @entity8 after he walked behind the bar and she told him to leave			2
at the civil trial , @entity8 was asking jurors to hold @entity10 and the city liable for damages to compensate her for any pain or distress she suffered			1
jurors sided with her after listening to weeks of testimony			0
' i 'm still in shock , ' @entity8 said outside the courtroom after the verdict , adding that she hopes she can move on with her life now			2
the brute : @entity10 , a former @entity9 police officer convicted for the 2007 beating of @entity8 , leaves a federal building after the first day of a civil trial stemming from a lawsuit filed against him and the city by @entity8 @entity8 's attorney , @entity19 , heralded the verdict as a landmark , precedent - setting decision			1
' we proved the code of silence at every level of the @entity29 , ' from the first officers who responded to the beating to then - chief @entity29 , @entity19 said after the verdict			2
@entity19 said the onus was now on mayor @entity93 to end that culture of protection and silence			0
' the question now becomes , what are they going to do about it ? ' he said			0
' if there 's going to be change , it has to come from the mayor 's office			0
' justice served : @entity8 hugs her attorney @entity19 after she was awarded $ 850,000 in damages by jurors during the civil trial , her attorneys alleged that police sought to downplay and cover up the beating , in part out of an ingrained but shadowy culture among police of protecting their own			1
they said that culture emboldened @entity10 and created an environment that led to the beating			0
city attorneys countered by telling jurors there was no evidence that such a secret code existed			0
the fact that @entity10 was eventually charged and convicted , they said , proved that the system worked			2
but some police officials who testified contradicted each other , which @entity8 's attorney said proved their point about alleged cover - ups			1
@entity133 , who headed the department 's internal affairs division at the time , testified that she recommended during a phone call three days after the beating to a @entity139 prosecutors that @entity10 be charged with a serious felony			0
pressed by @entity19 about whether she told the prosecutor she actually thought a misdemeanor battery charge was appropriate , @entity141 emphatically denied it			0
' absolutely incorrect , ' she said firmly			0
but less than an hour later , @entity145 , who was an internal affairs detective under @entity141 's command , said he was next to his boss at the time of the call			0
@entity145 testified @entity141 recommended the lesser charge			0
then when the prosecutor in question , @entity153 , took the stand , he told jurors the call never happened and that he never talked with @entity141 about charges			0
because @entity10 was off duty during the beating , @entity8 's attorneys needed to persuade jurors that the silence code exists , that it was sanctioned by the city and that it led to the beating and an attempted cover - up			1
@entity10 was on the witness stand for two days and asked by @entity8 's attorney about phone records showing he made dozens of calls to fellow officers in the hours after the beating			2
he said he was so drunk before the attack that he could n't remember calling anyone or what he might have said , though he insisted he ' did n't tell anyone to do anything regarding the incident			0
' @entity10 claimed he was bent on drowning his sorrows that day because he had just learned his dog was dying from cancer , telling jurors : ' i was on a mission to get inebriated			0
' but he said he never presented himself as an officer that night or asserted he had special off - duty privileges			1
