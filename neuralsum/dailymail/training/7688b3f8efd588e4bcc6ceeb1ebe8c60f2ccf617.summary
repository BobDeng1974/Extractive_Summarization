they will be taught how to avoid ‘ inflaming the situation ’ when their child flies off the handle under guidance drawn up to deal with thousands of children diagnosed with conduct disorders			1
the problem is estimated to affect one child in 20 aged five to 16 , with each costing £ 70,000 to educational and other services			1
the main recommendation , from the healthcare body @entity20 , is for group training programmes to be offered to the parents of children as young as three who have a conduct disorder or are at risk of developing one			1
they will act out situations involving ‘ challenging ’ behaviour and be taught how to stop saying ‘ no ’ to children			1
experts say that saying merely ‘ no ’ triggers further misbehaviour			0
instead parents will learn to ignore bad actions and reward the child for good behaviour			2
the guidance comes from the healthcare body @entity20 ( the @entity20 )			0
professor @entity39 , a member of the guideline group and professor of psychoanalysis at @entity42 ( @entity42 ) , said the advice did not mean parents were being misled by ‘ supernanny ’ and other gurus who advocate discipline and strict boundaries for children			1
he said ‘ all children can be naughty , defiant and impulsive from time to time , which is perfectly normal			0
‘ however , some children have extremely difficult and challenging behaviours that are outside the norm for their age			0
’ he said children diagnosed with a conduct disorder need to be managed in a counter-intuitive way			2
‘ parents are taught how to say yes			2
‘ they learn how to ignore negative behaviour and focus on the positive because the attention that normally follows from being told not to do something leads to more negative behaviour			0
‘ it ’s logical to say do n’t do that ’ he said			0
‘ these are not bad parents but a punitive approach makes things worse ’ he added			0
he said these children differ from occasionally naughty children by being persistently defiant in a range of situations			0
@entity76 issues : every single child with conductive disorder costs £ 70,000 to educational and other services with one in 20 aged between five and 20 affected by the problem professor @entity81 , director of the @entity82 , @entity42 and facilitator of the guideline group , said : ' conduct disorder has real consequences for the child and their families , schooling is disrupted , family life can become very stressful and problems with drug and alcohol misuse and the criminal justice system are common			1
‘ but the problems associated with conduct disorder are often lifelong ; with adults who had a conduct disorder during their childhood being far more likely to develop another mental health disorder when they are an adult - nearly half go on to develop antisocial personality disorder			2
‘ the costs to individuals , families and society of untreated conduct disorder are enormous			2
’ he said many parents would welcome help , which should be coordinated by @entity109 , teachers and social workers			0
‘ parent training programmes provide them with strategies for dealing with difficult children and how to better handle them going forward ’ he added			1
figures suggest adults who had a conduct disorder or conduct problems in childhood are responsible for 80 per cent of crime			0
it is estimated that the costs of services to individuals diagnosed with conduct disorder at the age of 10 over a period of about 18 years is estimated at £ 70,000			1
the estimated costs of group or individual parent training is £ 1,600 - £ 3,000 , while intensive family training may cost £ 15,000 , say @entity20 .			1
