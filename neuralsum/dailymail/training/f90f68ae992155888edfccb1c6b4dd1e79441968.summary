by @entity0 tragic : @entity1 , 22 , was trying to stop her boiler from leaking when she was hit by 230 volts and died a young mother was fatally electrocuted by 230 volts as she mopped up water from a leaking boiler in her flat because an electrician who tested it was unqualified			1
@entity1 , 22 , suffered the shock in her store cupboard as her one - year - old son @entity11 played in the living room nearby - just months after the mains were inspected			2
she was trying to turn off her stopcock to stop the boiler leaking but was hit by volts and lost consciousness almost immediately			1
her lifeless body was discovered by her boyfriend @entity19 when he returned to their flat in @entity22 at midday on december 14 , 2007			0
today , a court heard documents certifying the property as safe were filled out by an unqualified electrician - who can not remember carrying out the tests			0
@entity29 , 52 , drew up and signed papers on march 8 , 2006 , which said he had carried out tests at the flat , exercised reasonable care , and the circuits were safe			2
his work was approved by qualified supervisor @entity36 at @entity37 and @entity38 , which managed the block			1
however , in a police interview , mr @entity29 described himself as ' a mate of an electrician ' and ' was not qualified as an inspector ' , @entity40 heard			1
@entity45 , prosecuting , told a jury : ' the purpose of the certificate was to certify that the electrical installations were safe			0
' in fact they were far from safe and expert investigations since @entity1 ’s death have revealed that a cable in circuit three had been penetrated by a screw during the construction phase and that caused a metal frame to become live and charged to 230 volts			1
' that occurred prior to the testing and inspection carried out by @entity29			0
her 23 - month - old son @entity11 had been playing on the floor near her when she was hit ' if @entity29 had tested circuit three properly or at all as he purported to have done and @entity36 signed he had then the fault that was present would have been detected immediately and the problem investigated and remedied			1
' ( in police interviews ) he stated he was an electrician ’s mate who was used to working in a pair and he was at @entity72 to assist with the secondary fittings			2
' he said he was not qualified to act as a test inspector , he admitted the writing and signature was his but said he did n’t remember carrying out any electrical insulation tests			0
' it came just months after documents were signed to prove the property 's mains ha been checked the court heard that during the construction a screw used to attach plasterboard to the metal frame in the wall in the store cupboard penetrated a cable causing it to become live			2
as a result of the blunder , when miss @entity1 ’s boiler leaked , the puddle of water in her store cupboard crept under the skirting board and touched the frame - meaning it was also live			0
when miss @entity1 knelt in the puddle as she prepared to mop the floor she too became electrically charged and when she touched the earthed stopcock she suffered a huge shock			0
@entity29 and @entity36 , who are both from @entity104 , @entity105 , both deny one charge of breaching the @entity107 in relation to the work they carried out in march 2006			1
the trial , which is expected to last eight days , continues			0

@entity1 , 22 , fatally hit by 230 volts as she tried to stop boiler leaking
@entity118 had been ' checked ' , documents approved by qualified supervisor
@entity29 , who inspected flat , told police he was ' electrician 's mate '
he and supervisor @entity36 plead not *guilty* to breaching @entity125
