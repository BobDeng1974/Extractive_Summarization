@entity0 will attempt to bring goals to @entity2 as he prepares for an intensely difficult start to the @entity5 campaign			1
the @entity6 travel to in - form @entity8 on @entity9 on the back of three successive defeats , the last of them a 1 - 0 reverse at the hands of neighbours @entity14 , an unprecedented fourth consecutive derby loss			1
just a few weeks ago , it would have been a fixture @entity0 's men might have approached with some relish having already dispensed with @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
@entity2 players joked around in training giving each other piggy backs on wednesday morning @entity26 ( top ) is given a lift by @entity29 during training exercises on wednesday morning @entity2 players joke around ahead of their visit to @entity33 to face @entity8 on @entity9 @entity2 showed no signs of a hangover following their 1 - 0 defeat against @entity14 asked if his team had saved its best performances for the @entity41 's big boys , the 53 - year - old replied : ' yes and no. ' some of the top clubs , we have not played so well - @entity44 , we did n't play well , but @entity19 we beat , @entity21 we beat as well			1
' we can raise our game , but we do n't score a lot of goals , and that 's something that is a concern , really , going into the second half of the season , how many goals we have scored			2
' that 's an area we are going to have to improve on against any team			0
' but when you play the top teams , you can keep it tight and one goal , two goals can sometimes be enough			0
but not always , and we need to score more goals			0
' @entity2 have fared reasonably well on their most recent league visits to @entity33 , drawing 1 - 1 there in november 2011 , losing by the odd goal in seven on @entity9 the following year and finally ending a 41 - year wait for a victory in december last year			1
@entity63 trains with @entity2 on wednesday morning ahead of their trip to @entity33 on @entity9 @entity0 ( @entity65 ) holds training and dishes out instructions during the session on wednesday @entity0 said : ' we have had decent performances at @entity33 , i think , in the last three			1
we drew , we lost in the last minute - which was a cracking game - 4 - 3 , and then we won last year , so we have done reasonably well there			2
' one of the reasons we have one well there is we have retained possession well , and that 's something we are going to have to do because you ca n't turn possession over to @entity8 with the quality they have got up front			2
' they are going well at the minute			0
they are on a great run , and it 's a game that every time you play them , you have to look forward to it			0
i certainly do and i am sure our senior players and young players will too			0
' the players go through sprinting exercises on a chilly wednesday morning in the @entity98 @entity99 was wrapped up during the training session as @entity2 prepared for @entity8 one of those young players is 21 - year - old keeper @entity63 , who has been thrust into the limelight by injuries to senior men @entity103 and @entity105			1
his opposite number on friday , @entity108 @entity107 , has emerged as the bedrock of @entity8 's improving form , and @entity0 knows how difficult it will be to find a way past him			1
he said : ' there 's a contrast in goal at the moment : @entity63 is on his second or third @entity41 start , and @entity118 pushing ( @entity120 ) @entity119 for the title of being the best goalkeeper in the world			0
' he 's a fantastic shot - stopper			2
he still has parts of his game that he still wishes to develop , but in one on one situations , he excels and covers a lot of the areas where goalscorers want to score in , with his feet , his hands and how he wants to approach things			0
' he makes it very difficult to score , so you have to go with power and go for the corners			0
