by @entity0 published : 23:40 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 13:25 est , 5 june 2013 a 3,000 - year - old burial site has been found to contain the remains of migrants from as far away as @entity4 and the western @entity5			1
archaeologists conducting a study of @entity9 residents found three distinct groups in the burial pits at @entity12 , near @entity13 , @entity14			1
using analysis of oxygen and strontium isotopes in tooth enamel the researchers found while one group had been born locally , the other two groups came from much further afield			1
research at the burial site in @entity14 found migrants from @entity4 and western @entity25 had been buried there a total of 25 people , aged between 6 and 55 at the time of their death , were found in the pits , according to @entity32			1
the isotopes , which are derived from drinking water , can be used to identify where the individual was living at the time their tooth enamel formed			1
the researchers found a group of nine spent their lives in the local area , while eight were believed to have been born in what is now southern @entity44 or @entity45			0
another five came from the western @entity5 , possibly @entity46 or even @entity47			0
@entity48 , editor of @entity49 , which will publish the research today , said : ' this is the first burial site of its type that we â€™ve found and it reveals that @entity57 was always part of a bigger landscape that includes most of @entity25			1
' mr @entity48 said the site at @entity12 was unusual as the majority of @entity9 burials were cremations			2
a total of 25 people , aged between 6 and 55 at the time of their death , were found in the pits at @entity13 the burials at this site however , which range from the early @entity9 to the middle @entity69 , a period of 900 years , had seen people buried with animals in carefully posed positions			2
one woman , in her 50s , is thought to have been a ' willing sacrifice ' , killed by sword blows to her head			0
@entity82 , from @entity83 , which carried out the excavation , said : ' with seven of 13 late @entity9 individuals analysed , two of five early @entity69 and five of seven middle @entity69 , all showing evidence for immigration , this could be characterised as a mortuary site dominated by migrants			2
' last month , @entity88 reported how the first recorded case of child abuse in history was believed to have been uncovered in @entity92			0
archaeologists said the 2 to 3 - year - old child , known only as ' burial 159 ' , showed signs of having repeatedly had her bones broken , and being shaken repeatedly			0
the find is believed to be the oldest record of child abuse			0
experts said it may stem from an @entity92 belief that children had to be ' toughened up ' as they grow .			0

researchers discover migrants in @entity9 burial site in @entity14
some came from @entity4 while others from western @entity25
