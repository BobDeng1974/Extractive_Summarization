by @entity0 a 73 - year old veteran from @entity2 has been fired from a @entity4 restaurant for giving a homeless man a muffin			1
@entity7 has worked at the restaurant in @entity9 for the past three - and - a - half year and appears to have a heart of gold			1
it was when a man who looked as though he had fallen on hard times walked into the store , he thought he would give him a little extra			1
' he looked a little needy			2
he asked if i had any mayonnaise and some tarter sauce			2
he said he was going to cook a fish , ' he told @entity21			2
' i got it for him			2
as he walked out i put a corn muffin in			1
' that gesture cost @entity7 his job			1
' the general manager called me in and said he had some bad news for me			2
@entity7 we are going to have to let you go			1
' @entity7 says that he has been written up before for what sound like the most trivial of things			1
once he was reprimanded for getting a fountain drink on the job and on a second occasion he gave a cup of coffee to woman , which he claims he paid for			2
the culprit : @entity7 gave a homeless a corn muffin for free			1
he was fired for doing so rewarded : @entity7 says he has worked hard to earn the four gold stars that adorned his apron a lifetime of service : @entity7 served his country in @entity63 and he now says he is looking for something else to supplement his @entity65 he admits that rues are rules			1

i think it is horrible this vet lost his job over a muffin			2
but the store has rules the food is their property			0
where does the employer draw the line			0
maybe next time it would be a sandwich , a full meal ? he violated the policy 's he was well aware of			0
