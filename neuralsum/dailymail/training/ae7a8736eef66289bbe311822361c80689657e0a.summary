by @entity0 published : 19:19 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 03:22 est , 30 january 2013 say cheese : @entity2 with the winning cheeseboard that made him @entity4 at the @entity5 he says his @entity6 is fluent , but one wonders how much @entity2 understood of what was being muttered about him in @entity8 , the capital of @entity11 gastronomy , last weekend			1
after becoming the first foreigner to scoop the top prize in one of @entity6 ’s most prestigious national contests for cheese - mongers , the @entity12 said the other competitors had been ‘ friendly and encouraging ’			1
if so , that ’s commendable , not to mention rather startling , given the @entity6 ’s famous fondness for fromage			0
‘ any country with 300 cheeses can not die , ’ remarked @entity22 , and today @entity6 is reckoned to have more than 1,000 varieties			0
all the more galling then that two of the cheeses presented to the judges by @entity29 were — sacre bleu ! — a stilton and a @entity32			0
‘ the @entity6 do n’t have many things comparable to a stilton , ’ says @entity37 ‘ to them it ’s really quite exotic			0
’ as if all that is not enough , the @entity6 must be choking on their camembert to discover the relative inexperience of the man who became ‘ @entity43 ’ in the @entity5			1
though judged to be one of @entity6 ’s foremost experts on the food , 30 - year - old @entity29 has been in the cheese business for little more than a year			1
until 2011 , he was working for the @entity48 as an accountant			1
when he learned his employer was offering unpaid sabbaticals of up to two years — a kind of ‘ trial separation ’ , as he puts it — he seized the chance to swap his calculator for a cheese wire			1
‘ i enjoyed elements of my job , but i felt it was perhaps not what i wanted to do for the rest of my life , ’ says the man who now wrestles not with columns of figures but blocks of cheese			1
with an uncut @entity69 weighing upwards of 170lb — the average weight of a @entity73 male — the work has had an unexpected effect on @entity29 ’s waistline			0
@entity76 : mr @entity2 had to present a cheese platter that he had selected and matured himself as part of the @entity5 at the @entity80 et @entity79 ‘ you need pretty big biceps to work with some of the bigger blocks , ’ he says			1
‘ i thought i might get fatter with all the cheese i get to taste , but , in fact , i ’ve lost weight			1
’ this is but one perk for @entity29 , who fell in love with @entity6 and its cheeses when he went to @entity8 to learn @entity6 after graduating from @entity91 with a degree in chemistry			1
‘ i worked on a farm where they were making goat ’s cheese , and discovered there is something compelling about the people who are involved with it			1
‘ there ’s not really much money to be made in cheese , especially on a small scale , so they tend to be people who are passionate about what they do , interested in keeping something historic alive , but also in creating something brilliant			2
i found them engaging to be around			0
’ @entity29 , who fell in love with @entity6 and its cheeses when he went to @entity8 to learn @entity6 after graduating from @entity91 with a degree in chemistry his fascination with cheese was put on hold — ‘ except that i liked to eat lots of it ’ — while he pursued his accountancy career , but one saturday he started chatting with a stall - holder at @entity121 food market			1
he was selling cheeses supplied by the @entity126 - @entity125 , one of @entity6 ’s best - known cheesemongers , and gave him the name of a contact in @entity8			1
it was the start of what has turned out to be a remarkable venture for @entity29 and his fiancée , @entity133 , who works in publishing			0
we left home with some savings , an idea we might want to live in @entity8 and a fair amount of enthusiasm , ’ says @entity37 ‘ around that time i saw pictures of the kinds of platters presented at the @entity6 cheese competitions , but i had no idea then that i would be up there one day , not only putting one together but actually winning			1
’ @entity29 ’s fast track to fromagerie fame continued when he was offered work experience at @entity126 - @entity125 ’s shop in @entity8			1
taken on as a trainee cheese - monger , he learned some of his most important lessons in the ‘ caves ’ — a term dating back to the days when the first blue cheeses were matured in the natural caves of @entity6 , the temperatures and humidity proving ideal for the growth of mould			1
‘ part of what i love about good cheese is that it ’s an expression of the land that produced it , ’ says @entity37 ‘ i ’ve heard stories about farmers shooing their cows from under trees when it ’s raining so they are forced to feed on fresh grass rather than ruminating what they have eaten already			2
‘ all those things affect the taste — there ’s far more to cheese than you could ever imagine			2
’ such knowledge is tested in the written section of the competition won by @entity29 last weekend			2
which cheese is hand - wrapped in chestnut leaves ? ( a southern variety called @entity186			1
) and which is made from the last ebbs of milk from cows making milk for large wheels of @entity193 in the @entity195 pastures ( @entity196 , not something you find in your average sarnie )			0
selection : mr @entity2 's selection included two @entity73 cheeses , a stilton and a @entity32 ( stock ) candidates must then identify unlabelled cheeses from all over @entity6 , an art in which @entity29 has quickly become skilled			1
‘ first , you look at the colour			0
if it ’s yellowy , that suggests it ’s made from cow ’s milk , because of the carotene in the grass they eat			0
if it ’s white , then you are probably looking at goat or ewe ’s cheese			2
‘ then you crumble it to see how it has been made , how the curds push together			0
finally , you taste it			0
is it acidic or sweet ? does it have a woolly , sheepy taste , or is it more goaty ? ‘ @entity228 has it a woody flavour , like @entity231 , which is wrapped in a belt of spruce bark ? these are all things you get to distinguish in time			0
’ equally challenging is the section where contenders slice a block of cheese into specified weights without scales			2
‘ judging the weight by eye is something that @entity6 customers expect you to get right because it ’s something they are very good at themselves , ’ says @entity37 ‘ they have grown up around cheese			2
’ the highlight of the competition is the presentation of the platters of up to 25 cheese ‘ sculptures ’			1
‘ you know roughly the size of the platter , but not the shape , so it ’s all about what you do on the day , which makes it very pressured , ’ says @entity29 who carved his cheeses into elaborate crescent shapes			0
apart from the @entity269 — ‘ one of the @entity73 cheeses i ’ve always loved ’ — his other selected cheeses included a @entity271 gruyere , which he describes as tasting ‘ savoury and fruity at the same time and with great texture ’			0
and , more practically , he picked mimolette , an orangey cheese from @entity280			2
‘ it added great colour and it ’s very easy to carve , ’ he says			0
he clearly impressed the judges			0
‘ he was best , that ’s all you can say			0
he worked hard on his presentations , with great passion and knowledge , ’ says the competition organiser @entity285			2
so what ’s next ? ‘ i want to keep improving my knowledge about cheese and it ’s definitely something i ’m considering as a career , ’ he says			2
that ’s bad news for @entity29 ’s competitors			0
after all , they might have applauded the upstart ‘ @entity300 ’ last weekend , but who could blame them if they feel a bit cheesed off ?			0
