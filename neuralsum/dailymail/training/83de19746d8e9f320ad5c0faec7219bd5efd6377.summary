if there was one complaint @entity2 could have filed about his team ’s relentless domestic form in 2015 : @entity5 had n’t been warming up much for the task of keeping @entity7 at bay			0
@entity5 ’s incredible double save in the final minute of yesterday ’ s win over @entity12 confirmed that the @entity14 1 ’s brilliance has not been dulled one bit by the tranquil days spent watching his team tot up a streak of eight victories			1
@entity5 conceded a goal for the first time since a december 21 defeat to @entity22 , as @entity23 dragged @entity24 back into the contest and set up a final push			2
@entity14 striker @entity27 collects @entity29 's through ball to score past @entity30 in the first minute the 24 - year - old has scored eight goals in 25 games for @entity14 so far this season @entity12 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity30 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 ( @entity39 67 ) , @entity40 , @entity41 ( @entity42 14 ) , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 ( @entity46 76 ) subs not used : @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 booked : @entity45 , @entity38 scorers : @entity53 72 @entity14 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity5 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 ( @entity61 82 ) , @entity62 ( @entity63 68 ) , @entity64 , @entity27 ( @entity65 62 ) subs not used : @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 booked : @entity58 , @entity55 scorers : @entity27 1 , @entity64 52 referee : @entity73 attendance : 6,727 with @entity14 tiring on a poor pitch in their third game in a week and the hosts threatening a comeback , the champions were more vulnerable than at any stage of a run in which @entity5 had been largely inactive			1
that is when the @entity85 keeper ’s unflappable class came to the rescue			0
his strong right - handed block of a @entity46 header from six yards was excellent			2
when @entity34 returned fire with a volley , his reaction was a world - class save with his left hand to force it over the bar			2
it augurs well for what are likely to be his busiest engagements of the season : the @entity102 last - 32 ties against @entity7 , starting at @entity103 on thursday night			2
and the last - ditch heroics slammed the door shut on any chink of hope that @entity108 had of being able to close the league title gap today			0
@entity27 and @entity64 scored the goals that sent @entity14 six points clear of the @entity108 , who visit @entity113 , and @entity116 , winners at @entity115 yesterday			1
@entity14 midfielder @entity64 battles for the ball with @entity12 left - back @entity43 @entity12 forward @entity45 slides in to tackle @entity14 captain @entity58 as he surges forward if @entity2 ’s men continue in the winning habit , it will be an inordinate ask for the pursuers to remain in touch			1
and should it turn into another title canter for @entity14 , they can start entertaining themselves with a quickest goal competition			1
that is , if they have n’t started already			0
@entity27 returned to the starting line - up to score after 35 seconds in @entity130 , beating new colleague @entity132 ’s debut effort at @entity133 by three ticks of the clock			1
@entity27 , scorer in back - to - back weekend cup ties , missed wednesday ’s @entity137 win over @entity138 through injury			1
his ankle was back in full working order and there was no chance that those scoring senses would ever be blunted by just a midweek break with the feet up			0
saints ’ sleepy start aided the cause as @entity59 ’s perfectly weighted long pass went right in between @entity35 and @entity36 to feed @entity27			2
the rest was textbook for a natural - born finisher as he tucked his fourth league goal of the season past @entity30			0
@entity27 had taken less than a minute to do what @entity67 , the man he replaced from midweek , has n’t achieved since november 30			1
it ’s going to be hard for the @entity158 to state a case for anything other than spending the bulk of his remaining loan period on the bench			0
@entity14 created plenty of openings with @entity64 enjoying an instant rapport with his two new midfield colleagues @entity60 and @entity62			1
an enforced change did at least alter the intent of the home side and pose the threat of an equaliser			0
@entity41 limped off with a calf injury and substitute @entity42 accompanied @entity45 in attack			0
@entity42 was immediately in action , flashing a header narrowly wide from @entity23 ’s delivery			0
saints ’ improvements still left them susceptible to the off - the - cuff class of @entity60 , however			0
he and @entity62 have already been dubbed @entity184 because they do everything together			0
@entity64 is tackled by @entity12 's @entity35 ( right ) and @entity40 ( left ) at @entity187 it could be a name , too , for one of @entity60 ’s bewildering tricks and @entity12 would have suffered from one such manoeuvre had @entity192 not intervened			1
a trademark shuffle carved him the space and his terrific left - foot strike was soaring into the top corner before @entity30 kept @entity24 in the game with a fingertip save			2
with their @entity201 test looming , @entity14 wished to secure three points with the minimum of fuss and without suffering any key injuries			2
the sight of @entity56 nursing a knock on his right foot gave cause for concern but @entity2 , who has higher hopes for @entity212 facing @entity7 than @entity213 , reported no fresh injury worries			0
by the 52nd minute , it appeared they had achieved the other aim of the afternoon by going 2 - 0 ahead			1
@entity62 clipped the ball into the box and @entity27 provided the knockdown for @entity64 to take advantage of stand - off defending			1
@entity64 shrugs off a challenge from @entity12 's @entity35 ( right ) to score his side 's second goal neither @entity35 , @entity36 nor @entity43 got close to the ball - juggling skills of @entity64 , who then unleashed a deadly finish with the right boot			1
it ca n’t be long before @entity233 arguments begin and the @entity235 ’s name is prominent			0
but , as @entity64 pointed out post-match , you need match - winners at both ends and @entity5 was required to turn into @entity14 ’s hero after @entity12 brought the pressure			1
@entity36 ’s run and deflected cross gave @entity5 a nightmare ball to handle across goal and on the bounce			0
he used his knees to see off that threat but could n’t prevent @entity23 hammering home the rebound from eight yards out			0
@entity5 ’s proud streak of shut - outs and a run of 13 hours and 36 minutes without conceding had come to an end but he had no time or interest in dwelling on that personal setback			2
@entity12 's @entity44 smashes in a rebound shot to pull one back for the home side at 1 - 2			1

@entity14 won at @entity12 to extend their lead at the top of the @entity264
@entity27 gave the visitors a 1 - 0 lead in the first minute
midfielder @entity64 doubled that lead in the second - half
@entity12 pulled one back through @entity44 on 72 minutes
despite a late flurry from @entity12 , the @entity274 were able to hold on
