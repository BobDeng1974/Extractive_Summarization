and the comparisons are about to continue because 24 - year - old @entity1 has now embarked on an acting career that has already seen her rubbing shoulders with a-list stars sir @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
@entity23 : the @entity24 – a @entity26 - style film that has its @entity28 premiere this week – is @entity1 ’s first major role			1

‘ people tell me i look like my granny – and i ’m proud of that , ’ she says			2
‘ she is the person who more than any other has inspired me			2
if i can achieve some of her success , i will be more than satisfied			2
’ @entity41 , of course , has starred in some of the most popular and enduring films of our time , among them @entity46 and @entity47 , for which she won a best actress @entity48			2
but it was her depiction of @entity52 in the 1966 wildlife classic , which co-starred her real - life husband @entity54 , for which she will always be remembered			2

‘ we went to see confiscated ivory and i saw for myself how poachers kill and mutilate elephants just to get their tusks for ivory			0
‘ they would chop off the animal ’s feet to make stools			0
how barbaric is that ? i ca n’t believe people still think it a status thing to own , along with items like tiger rugs			0
how could anyone consider such things beautiful when they have come from such barbarity ? ‘ it was not a comfy ride			0
i was confronted by sights that were quite shocking			0
on one anti-poaching patrol we came upon a dead elephant , whose face had been hacked to get the ivory out and the rest of the body was left to rot			0
‘ the smell was horrendous and it was such a waste			0
it made me understand even more why my father and grandmother do what they do			0

‘ she would regale us with tales about being on set in @entity15 , the things she saw , the famous people she worked with , and even about meeting the @entity139 , ’ @entity1 says			1
‘ she was really good at accents and voices – it was like having my own personal drama teacher from a very young age			0

’ @entity1 says that she also learned her craft from watching both her grandparents on screen			1
‘ i watched all their movies , including the animal documentaries that are not so well known , ’ she says			0
‘ i saw how they brought the characters to life with the simplest of gestures			0
first major role : miss @entity1 features in @entity159 : the @entity24 – a @entity26 - style film that has its @entity28 premiere this week ‘ one of the best tips my gran gave me about being an actress was that the eyes are the key to the soul			1
she said i should be able to convey a lot through my eyes			0
’ such was @entity59 ’s influence that she was the first person @entity1 told after she landed the role in @entity159			1
@entity1 says : ‘ i usually call her after an audition , but this time i was standing by a bus stop shrieking with joy			1
she told me to be calm and relax during filming			0
’ @entity23 : the @entity24 tells the story of a super-secret spy organisation that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid , who is taken under the wing of suave older spy @entity184 ( @entity21 )			1
@entity1 plays the part of society woman @entity186 , but is reluctant to reveal anything more about the character , maintaining ‘ it ’s all very hush - hush until the premiere ’			1
the rising star has landed a number of minor roles since leaving university , and it is rumoured that director @entity195 told her she was too beautiful for a role in @entity197			1

i do n’t want to ride the back of someone else ’s wave			2
’ and although she is now off to @entity217 where she is hoping to further her career , will she in due course take the baton from her grandmother in promoting the @entity4 charity ? ‘ @entity224 is my passion , but if i had the opportunity to influence others , then i would work in any way i could to promote and inspire people to care about @entity4 , ’ @entity1 adds			1
