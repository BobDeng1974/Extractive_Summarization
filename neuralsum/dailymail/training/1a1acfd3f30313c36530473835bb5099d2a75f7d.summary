@entity0 will be very welcome visitors to the @entity2			0
they come fresh from a 3 - 1 defeat to @entity6 at the weekend , they have a new coach in @entity8 who has not convinced supporters , and they have 36 - year - old @entity10 holding their defence together			2
it should be a morale - boosting win for @entity14 ... and how they need it			2
the team that followed up winning last season ’s competition by signing three of the stars of the @entity21 are currently languishing in 13th place in @entity23 having lost two of their opening three fixtures			2
@entity27 has admitted there is an ‘ attitude problem ’ among his squad while the players believe the difficulties have been created by the sale of two of the team ’s most important players - either way it ’s a mess			0
@entity39 and his team - mates are busy preparing for tuesday 's @entity42 clash against @entity43 @entity44 ( left ) and @entity14 have only won one of their first three @entity23 matches this season @entity27 could come under pressure at @entity14 soon if results do not start to improve @entity14 star @entity39 helped his side to a @entity42 win last season but was still targeted by fans @entity14 won the @entity42 last season but a crisis is starting to brew in the @entity56 capital supporters jeered @entity58 throughout the defeat to @entity60 at the weekend and whistled the whole team off at the end of the game			1
several autograph hunters tried to kick out at @entity39 ’s car as he drove away from the club ’s @entity67 training ground without stopping for signings and photographs , and some of the club ’s supporters even took to draping banners over various bridges on the city ’s @entity76 ring road calling for the resignation of president @entity79			1
it is @entity79 who makes the transfer - market decisions in @entity14 and his tried and tested formula of signing the latest boy wonder of world football at whatever cost - financing such outlay through commercial deals and the sale of other players - is nothing new and was in evidence again this summer			1
@entity42 winning coach @entity27 was told @entity93 was going and that @entity94 and @entity95 would be incoming			1
at first @entity27 , who after years at @entity96 under @entity97 is a master of keeping a very hands - on president happy , did not fret			2
@entity94 , @entity100 and @entity101 still made for solid midfield three			0
@entity58 has been the subject of booing by @entity14 fans after the side 's poor start to the season @entity0 are managed by @entity8 ( right ) and their defence is led by the 36 - year - old @entity10 ( left ) @entity39 ( left ) could be shifted further back into midfield in order to accommodate all the attacking players but then the club sanctioned @entity101 ’s move to @entity116			1
@entity117 kept his calm and moved on to plan c - using @entity119 alongside @entity100 and @entity94			0
but @entity119 got injured and is out for a month so the @entity121 coach was on to plan @entity122 which , judging from defeats to @entity124 and @entity60 , is not working too well			0
the president would like to see @entity94 and @entity100 as a pair in midfield with @entity39 , @entity95 and @entity44 behind @entity129 in attack but @entity27 and his coaching staff see that option as offering @entity14 ’s full - backs , attacking by nature , little or no protection			1
either @entity39 and @entity44 would have to spend half the game tracking back , or the likes of @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 would be left exposed			0
one - time @entity14 sporting director @entity141 says in the first galatico era between 2003 and 2006 he once asked @entity79 to give him his first xi. owing to the abundance of attacking players the president had @entity147 at centre - back and @entity149 at right back			1
this is what @entity27 must contend with			0
@entity153 ( left ) , @entity154 ( centre ) and @entity139 ( right ) train in @entity14 ahead of the match with @entity0 the @entity14 players are preparing for their @entity42 opener against @entity0 after a poor @entity23 start it has been suggested to the coach that he put @entity39 back in midfield to cover the loss of @entity166			1
the logic behind the suggestion - understood to have come from on high - is that as a former full - back @entity39 would be able to do the defensive work that @entity166 used to do			0
having scored the winning goal in the @entity171 final last season - running from the half - way line in the 87th minute - and then the goal that put @entity14 in front in the @entity42 final , not to mention 21 other goals and 20 assists , asking @entity39 to do more defensive work seems bizarre			1
but maybe no more bizarre than selling the team ’s top assist provider @entity166 rather than pay him 4m euros a year more in wages			0
on monday @entity27 was saying the right things : he is happy with his squad and would n’t swap it for any other in @entity186			0
win on tuesday against the @entity187 and then beat @entity188 away at the weekend and @entity189 at home , then talk of crisis will subside			0
any slips however , and with a visit to @entity194 in the league - where @entity14 could only draw last season - and a trip to @entity198 to play @entity199 on the horizon , the question marks will soon go from centring on whether the coach is happy with his squad to whether his president is happy with @entity27			2
@entity95 was signed for huge money this summer and @entity27 has had to accommodate him @entity39 watches on as @entity205 shows his skills during a @entity14 training session			1

@entity14 host @entity0 at the @entity210 in the @entity42
@entity27 's side have won just one of opening three @entity23 matches
@entity0 also in poor form after loss to @entity6 at weekend
captain @entity58 and @entity39 targets of supporters ' frustrations
@entity27 lost @entity93 and @entity101 so needed to *re-shuffle* side
@entity95 and @entity94 arrived at @entity14 in *big* - money deals
if @entity27 does not start winning he will come under pressure from above
president @entity79 expects his *expensive* side to win matches
