the @entity1 - led coalition in the @entity2 launched 11 air strikes against @entity5 targets today , hitting six targets in @entity7 and five in @entity9 ( file photo ) today @entity1 officials said @entity1 - led air strikes against @entity5 in @entity9 have killed three of the militant group 's top leaders but not senior commander @entity37			1
among those killed was @entity39 , whom the officials described as the group 's military ' emir , ' and @entity44 , a deputy to @entity45			2
those strikes took place between dec. 3 and dec. 9 , they said			0
today @entity1 officials @entity1 - led air strikes against @entity5 in @entity9 have killed three of the militant group 's top leaders but not senior commander @entity37 ( pictured ) they also confirmed last month 's killing of @entity53 , whom local medical sources had described to @entity19 at the time as the radical militant group 's leader in the northern city of @entity24			1
news of the killings , first reported by the @entity60 , came the same day the top @entity1 commander of coalition efforts against the @entity5 , lieutenant general @entity63 , hailed the impact of four months of air strikes in @entity9			1
' we 've made significant progress in halting that ( militant ) offensive , ' @entity63 told reporters			0
he pointed to successful air strikes this week around @entity9 's @entity72 and @entity73			1
those strikes helped @entity76 peshmerga fighters fight their way to @entity79 mountain and , according to a @entity76 leader , free hundreds of people trapped there by @entity5 fighters			1
army lt. gen. @entity63 , commander of the @entity84 , takes questions during a briefing at the @entity87 on thursday at the same time , @entity63 outlined a long fight ahead , cautioning it would take several years to build necessary capabilities of @entity9 forces , who crumbled during the @entity5 's offensive this summer			2
@entity63 said the next wave of @entity1 troops will begin moving into @entity9 in a couple of weeks to train local forces			2
he said the challenge is to get @entity9 units trained and back into the fight so they can plan operations to regain contested areas such as @entity24			0
he said that while there has been progress in halting the militants ' charge across @entity9 , ' i think what we must do , especially inside of @entity9 , is continue to build those ( @entity9 ) capabilities			0
i think you 're at least talking a minimum of three years			0
' the @entity9 army wants to launch a counteroffensive to retake @entity24 , the largest city in northern @entity9 , and the @entity1 likely would help			2
while there have been some concerns that @entity9 's military may not be ready yet for such an ambitious operation , defense secretary @entity114 said last week that the @entity1 is working with senior @entity9 leaders on preparations			1
' part of the planning has to be how you generate force to do operations , ' @entity63 told reporters during a briefing in the @entity87			0
the question , he said , is ' how do you get into a place where you can generate some capability , pull some units back so that you can make them better , and then now start to put those against operations down the road			0
' he declined to reveal when a @entity24 operation might be launched			0
there have been fewer details and more limited media access to @entity1 military operations in @entity9 this time than during the eight years of war that ended in 2011			2
@entity1 officials say it 's because the military is there only to advise and assist the sovereign @entity9 government			1
there are currently about 1,700 @entity1 troops in @entity9 , and president @entity148 has authorized up to 3,000			0
more than 1,000 @entity1 troops are expected to be deployed in the coming weeks to increase the effort to advise and assist @entity9 units at the higher headquarters levels and also to conduct training at several sites around the country			0
@entity63 also offered an optimistic view of the @entity159 - dominated @entity9 government 's progress in working more with the @entity161 tribes			0
president @entity148 said one of the main reasons for authorising air strikes was to prevent an impending massacre of the ethnic minority @entity166 ( pictured ) the @entity1 has bombed areas in @entity79 ahead of a @entity76 peshmerga attempt to liberate the city			1
if recaptured , it would open up a corridor to @entity72 ( pictured ) , where hundreds of @entity166 remain besieged the deep sectarian divide fueled the advances of the @entity5 militants across @entity9 earlier this year as grievances led some align with the extremists			1
@entity1 officials have stressed that ongoing coalition assistance hinges in part on whether the @entity9 government becomes more inclusive			1
the @entity1 and @entity9 governments have proposed creating a national guard program that would arm and pay tribesmen to fight			0
@entity63 said thursday that as the @entity9 conduct more combat operations in @entity161 strongholds such as @entity187 , there will be more opportunities to bring tribal members into the fight			0
he said the national guard effort is starting and that he is optimistic the @entity9 government will approve legislation needed for the program to move forward			0
also today , a senior @entity76 official in @entity9 said the peshmerga fighters battling @entity5 militants have managed to open up a corridor to @entity72 so that thousands from the @entity166 minority trapped there can flee			1
@entity1 military experts arrived at @entity201 ( pictured ) last month to help train and support @entity9 forces @entity205 says the @entity76 forces established the passageway thursday , a day after launching the operation to retake the is - held @entity79 , the @entity204 reported			1
tens of thousands of @entity166 became trapped in the mountain in early august , when the @entity212 extremists captured the towns of @entity79 and @entity73 , prompting the exodus			2
many were eventually airlifted off the mountain or escorted by a passageway through @entity7 back into @entity9 , to find refuge in the @entity9 @entity76 semi-autonomous region in northern @entity9 , but thousands more came later and remained stuck on the mountain			1
' our hope is that all those people will eventually be able to go back to their own homes and villages and towns but those that are in need of evacuation now , a corridor has been opened to evacuate those people , ' mr @entity205 told @entity204 in @entity230 , the @entity76 regional capital			0
@entity166 follow an ancient religion with ties to @entity234			0
the @entity76 forces , known also as peshmerga , said in september that they would focus on @entity79 after liberating the nearby towns of @entity238 , @entity239 and @entity73 .			2

coalition war planes also hit five targets in is - held *territory* in @entity9
the @entity7 raids focused on the contested city of @entity13 , close to @entity15
today @entity1 officials @entity1 - led air strikes against @entity5 in @entity9 have killed three of the militant group 's top leaders but not senior commander @entity37 .
@entity76 official says peshmerga fighters have opened a path to @entity79
