by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 23 february 2013 updated : 17:23 est , 23 february 2013 eight - legged feast : @entity2 munches on a tarantula tarantula kebabs , fried crickets and mealworm burgers ... it sounds like a stomach - churning i ’m a celebrity bushtucker trial , or perhaps one of celebrity chef @entity12 ’s more outlandish recipes			1
in fact , bugs and grubs could become a staple of our daily diet in the not - too - distant future , according to nutrition experts			1
food writer @entity2 has spent the past few months in far - flung destinations where insects are eaten every day and as delicacies			1
his journey will feature in a @entity28 documentary , @entity25 ? – to be broadcast next month – and he says that such outlandish fare will become the norm in @entity31 before long			1
the @entity32 – perhaps in response to a @entity34 warning that meat will rocket in price due to booming populations – have already invested six - figure sums into researching ways of getting caterpillars and locusts into mainstream foods			2
here are some reasons why , and how , it could soon happen here ... a healthy option ‘ the cost of beef and lamb is going up and up – finding enough land to farm animals and meet demand is getting more and more difficult , ’ says @entity2 , 45 , who is also a panellist on @entity47 ’s @entity48			2
‘ insects are a healthy , nutritious and tasty alternative			2
many contain as much – or more – protein as meat or fish			2
some insects , especially in the larval stage , are also rich in fat and contain significant percentages of amino acids and essential vitamins and minerals			2
‘ added to this , insect - rearing requires less space and generates less pollution than livestock			2
’ @entity73 , senior forestry officer at the @entity74 of the @entity34 , has been carrying out studies into the worldwide use of insects as a food source			1
he says : ‘ western society tends to think of insects as being dirty but the nutritional benefits are many – crickets are rich in iron , zinc and calcium , for instance			2
‘ in @entity87 , people go into supermarkets to buy packets of crickets , silk worms or water bugs from the freezer section			1
they are foods of choice			0
even though many insects are fried and sold as snack food to drink with beer , they are much healthier than a packet of crisps			1
’ healthy grub : crickets are a great source of calcium - but it may take a while before they 're available at @entity107 or @entity108 's just add @entity109 @entity73 admits that persuading @entity110 to start eating bugs will be an uphill struggle , but says : ‘ look at the way sushi has been accepted on to menus and even as a takeaway snack			1
that would have been unheard of 20 years ago			0
’ @entity2 agrees : ‘ humans have been eating insects for thousands of years			1
' it ’s estimated that up to 2,000 species are available worldwide as a human food source , from beetles and spiders to ants and crickets			1
' in @entity128 , i visited a school where children ate fried crickets for lunch			0
’ @entity2 went hunting red ants and , despite his initial revulsion , admits : ‘ add some coriander , spring onion and soy sauce and the taste was incredible , zesty and creamy and absolutely delicious			0
’ what impressed him most was that bugs were responsible for sustaining communities			1
he discovered this when he joined a group of 14 - year - old boys in @entity145 to go tarantula - hunting			0
‘ the spiders provide a vital source of protein and it is part of the only main meal they will have all day , ’ he says			0
try it on the kids after the tarantulas are dug out of their nests in the ground with wooden poles , the insects are then grilled for up to 30 minutes			0
‘ they tasted very like prawn or crab and were actually delicious , ’ says @entity2			0
‘ there are n’t enough tarantulas to feed the world but the fact that they are so important to the diet of these boys highlights what an important food source insects can be			1
’ despite this , it still seems rather a stretch to imagine we will soon be buying mealworm burgers from @entity175 ’s			0
the key , says @entity2 , is in the presentation			0
‘ as long as people are fully aware of what they ’re buying , there is great potential in adding edible insects protein into supplements and processed foods			0
‘ i bought packets of mealworms online to cook for my children and we ’ve even experimented with earthworms and wood lice			0
‘ because they are young , they see trying them as an adventure			0
‘ it is only by encouraging youngsters to try them and prove that they actually taste good that we are going to be able to encourage more widespread use of insects in our diet			0
’ beer and @entity202 @entity2 adds : ‘ when you think about it , we already eat some strange things – take cheese with mould , and lobsters – but we do n’t find that odd			0
‘ maybe it will start in the pubs with something like crickets as a snack food			1
‘ then it will have to be marketed cleverly as an eco-choice			0
' i can easily see a time when we will be able to buy mealworm burgers in the freezer sections of supermarkets but sold as a ‘ ‘ green ’ ’ burger and packaged to appeal to those who prioritise health and the environment when it comes to food - buying			1
‘ if it is edible , good for you and tasty , why the heck not make it a part of the @entity31 way of life ? ’ can @entity25 ? , part of @entity238 ’s @entity237 season , starts on march 11			1

eating bugs could soon be the norm in @entity31 , says food writer
creepy *crawlies* are considered treats in many countries outside of @entity110
