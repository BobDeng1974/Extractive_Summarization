@entity0 fully authorized the torture of terror suspects , @entity4 officials have claimed , furiously dismissing accusations that the intelligence agency 's so - called ' enhanced interrogation techniques ' took place without the knowledge of the then - @entity11 president			1
an anonymous spokesman said the @entity4 's campaign or torturing suspected @entity14 and @entity16 operatives , which was revealed in a @entity18 report on tuesday , was ' a presidential programme , authorised , co-ordinated and administered through the @entity20			1
' the @entity4 fight came as @entity0 's former vice president @entity23 branded the @entity18 report a ' terrible piece of work ' that is ' deeply flawed ' , adding his voice to the claim that not only was @entity0 ' fully informed ' of the programme , he authorized it			1
' the report 's full of cr * * , ' @entity23 told @entity32 host @entity31 on wednesday evening			2
furthermore , the @entity4 never tortured anyone under the legal definition of the word , as asserted by @entity47 lawyers at the time , he said			0
the retired politician , who said it was his job in the administration to oversee programs like the one used by the @entity4 , said the government agency 's actions were ' justified ' and he ' do it again in a minute ' in order to save @entity11 lives			1
according to an anonymous @entity4 official , @entity0 was fully informed of the intelligence agency 's torture programme , and had in fact authorized its use			1
speaking to the @entity63 , the spokesman also identified a number of other senior @entity0 administration officials he claims ordered and approved the ' enhanced interrogation ' programme that led to 119 @entity14 suspects being tortured with techniques such as waterboarding			1
the official said those in the know included : @entity23 , @entity0 's legal adviser @entity23 ; national security adviser @entity74 ; @entity75 , her deputy ; attorney general @entity76 ; and several attorneys in the @entity47			2
he said that neither defense secretary @entity78 nor secretary of state @entity79 were officially informed of the @entity4 torture programme			1
claims that @entity0 was aware of the programme were reinforced by @entity23 in an interview with @entity32 wednesday evening			2
accused : @entity0 pictured alongside then vice president @entity23			1
the former @entity11 president fully authorized the brutal torture of terror suspects , @entity4 officials said today , furiously dismissing accusations that the intelligence agency 's so - called ' enhanced interrogation techniques ' took place without the knowledge the former @entity11 vice president said it is ' not true ' that @entity0 did n't know that aggressive interrogation techniques were being used on terrorism suspects until four years into the program			1
' read his book , ' @entity23 told @entity99			0
' he talks about it extensively in his memoirs			0
he was in fact an integral party of the program			0
he had to approve it before we went forward with it			0
' according to a @entity4 spokesperson , a number of high - ranking members of the @entity0 administration were informed of the @entity4 's ' enhanced interrogation ' programme			2
these include : @entity0 - @entity114 @entity23 - vice president of the @entity11 @entity23 - @entity0 's legal advisor @entity74 - @entity117 @entity75 - @entity118 @entity76 - @entity11 attorney general several attorneys in the @entity47			1
@entity23 said @entity0 was focused on a number of other issues at the time , but ' i think that he knew everything he needed to know and wanted to know about the program , ' including the fact that prisoners were being waterboarded			2
' there no effort on our part to keep him from that ' information @entity23 said , contrary to the claims made in the @entity18 report			2
' so the notion that the committee 's trying to peddle that somehow the agency was operating on a rogue basis and we were n't being told or the president was n't being told , is just a flat out lie , ' he stated			0
what really happened , @entity23 said , is ' we asked the agency to go take steps and put in place programs that were designed to catch the ba * * * * * * who killed 3,000 of us on 9/11 , and to make sure it did n't happen again , and that 's actually what they did			1
' the former second in command said that the @entity4 operatives who ran the detention and interrogation program ' deserve a lot of credit , ' not the ' condemnation ' they are receiving from @entity160 who authorized yesterday 's controversial report			0
@entity23 admitted that 9/11 mastermind @entity163 was waterboarded 183 times but he said that did not constitute torture			0
' what are we supposed to do ? kiss him on both cheeks and say , please , please tell us what you know ? ' @entity23 said			0
we did exactly what needed to be done in order to catch those who were guilty on 9/11 and to prevent a further attack , and we were successful on both parts			0
' the @entity0 era vice presidents said that the @entity4 only used techniques on terrorism suspects that it used on its own operatives as part of their training and that includes waterboarding			1
he admitted that rectal feeding , a process the @entity4 files revealed by the @entity18 say detainees were submitted to , was not one of the 12 techniques approved by the @entity20			0
but he then said : ' what are you prepared to do to get information about future attacks on the @entity11 ? ' ' in terms of there being some problems in the program , there may have well have been ... but i do n't think the @entity18 report represents the truth of what actually happened , ' he said			1
controversy : chained detainees are seen arriving at @entity207 on @entity208 ahead of interrogation about their suspected involvement with terrorist groups including @entity14 or the @entity16 @entity23 said he had n't read the entire 6,000 - page document that the @entity18 's redacted paper was based on nor had he read the full 500 - page declassified summary released by the @entity216 yesterday			2
upon learning that one of the interrogation subjects died , @entity23 said , ' i have no sympathy for them , ' again reminding @entity31 that @entity14 killed 3,000 @entity11 on 9/11			1
he later told the @entity32 that @entity11 have to remember that @entity14 was reportedly trying to get their hands on nuclear weapons after the assault on @entity11 soil and there were anthrax attacks occurring at the time			0
' there was every reason to expect ' that there was going to be a follow - up terrorist attack , as well , he said			0
the @entity4 ' did one hell of a job , and they deserve our gratitude , ' an unapologetic @entity23 said .			0

@entity4 official says former @entity11 president @entity0 was fully in formed of the intelligence agency 's torture programme
