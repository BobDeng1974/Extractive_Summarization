by @entity0 last updated at 2:30 pm on 10th january 2012 a teenager who received a donor liver rescued from a plane crash has come face to face with the hero firefighter who ran into the burning jet to retrieve it			1
@entity9 , from @entity10 , was hours from death when a private @entity12 carrying the organ from @entity14 crashed at @entity15 in thick fog			1
but firefighter @entity17 came to the rescue , freeing the pilot from the burning cockpit before returning to retrieve the donor organ			1
destroyed : the @entity12 on the runway at @entity15 after the crash in november my hero : @entity17 ( left ) met @entity9 ( right ) for the first time a year after he saved her liver from plane wreckage fashion student @entity9 was given a chance to live when she had the life - saving operation at @entity31 two days before her 18th birthday			1
and despite her body later rejecting the organ , she remains determined to keep fighting her rare condition of acute liver failure - and is now facing her third transplant			1
now more than a year after the runway crash , @entity9 and her family met @entity17 and the fire - fighting team at @entity15			1
@entity9 , now aged 19 , told the @entity41 : ' i ’d been in contact with @entity17 on email but this was the first time i got to meet him in person which was great			1
it was really weird to go the airport , be shown round and be told what happened that day			2
' i was desperately waiting for the transplant and my family had been told to say goodbye			2
it was quite overwhelming and emotional			2
' but it was great to finally meet @entity17 and say thank you in person for what he did			2
he is a hero - without that liver i would n’t have had a chance to live			1
' charred wreck : miraculously , the liver was not harmed despite the @entity12 being destroyed @entity17 described the “ surreal ” moment he plucked the liver from the wreckage of the plane in november 2010			1
he said : ' once everyone was out of the plane it was a case of get in there and have a look around			0
' there was this box at the side , a picnic box			0
when i was told it was a donor liver i did n’t really comprehend the importance of it			1
i just picked it up			0
' @entity17 , aged 42 and a firefighter at @entity15 for 11 years , first had contact with @entity9 when he was nominated for a @entity82			1
he said : ' i ’d never seen or spoken to @entity9 before , but i wanted her and her family to come and meet the watch			1
we showed her some of the pictures of the aircraft and said it was a miracle that anything survived			0
her mum was sitting there telling us the story about when @entity9 ’s liver started to fail and they were told to say their goodbyes			1
' i just sat there and said , ‘ you are calling us brave for rescuing a liver ? ’ we were just doing our jobs			2
' i feel embarrassed being called brave when they have gone through that			0
' @entity9 is hoping to have a third liver transplant recalling the events leading up to the crash , @entity17 said : ' it was a clear day then the tannoy sounded a warning of low visibility			1
suddenly it was like a wall of fog down the runway			0
' everything went completely white and then a couple of minutes later the alarm sounded indicating there had been an accident on the runway			0
' we looked out and could n’t see anything but above the fog appeared a plume of smoke			0
' we drove down the runway as slowly as possible because we could n’t see anything and we did n’t want to run anybody over			0
we could n’t find the aircraft then saw flames flickering on the grass			0
we drove over and that ’s where we saw the aircraft			0
' we did n’t know how many people were on board or anything but the co-pilot was standing there			0
' i asked , " is anybody else on board ? " and he said " a donor "			0
he probably said a donor liver but i do n’t remember			2
' i asked if there was anybody else ? he said , " yes the pilot , " so that was the priority , to get him out			0
he came out first and then i ran back in for the liver			2
' but it was just a job , i do what i ’m paid to do			0
' supportive : @entity9 pictured with parents @entity147 and @entity149 and her sister @entity150 earlier last year @entity17 added : ' if ever people wanted to know about organ donation , they only have to look at @entity9 and her family , to know how important it is			1
they are the best advert			0
' @entity9 ’s mum wrote a thank you card to us all and her dad wrote a letter just to me			1
it was so moving , and at the end of it , he just said , " from one dad to another , thanks for saving my daughter ’s life "			0
' there ’s nothing more you can say to that			0
' eight days after the transplant the liver died in @entity9 ’s body , leaving her devastated family fearing the worst			1
but another donor was found and the brave teen underwent a second life - saving operation with an organ that also had to be flown in - despite that flight almost being cancelled due to snow			2
yet that liver is now also failing and the battling teenager is now facing her third transplant			2
@entity9 said : ' even though the first liver from the crash did not work , it kept me alive and gave me a chance to get this far			1

rescued liver helped @entity9 survive for a year , but she now needs another organ
