@entity0 has denied the @entity2 charge over his quenelle gesture and requested a personal hearing in a move which could bring a premature end to his career			1
the @entity9 striker has previously insisted that his goal celebration was not anti-semitic and has requested a hearing into the charge of making a racially aggravated gesture , which carries a minimum five - match ban			1
but if @entity0 is still found guilty after the appeal , the ban could be doubled			1

' the striker has requested a personal hearing			1
the club will make no further comment until the @entity2 ’s disciplinary process has reached a conclusion			0
' as the player has just 16 games in which he can feature for @entity9 between now and the end of the season , a 10 - match ban could lead to @entity9 seeking to cancel his contract for gross misconduct — or pay it up early — as he would be little use to head coach @entity54 in the fight to avoid relegation			1
at the age of 34 and with just two goals to his name this season , it is highly unlikely he will be offered another deal elsewhere in the @entity65			0
@entity0 earlier pointed to comments made by a @entity68 group in @entity69 that the quenelle could not be regarded as anti-semitic in the context in which it was made			1
but later the same group clarified its stance , leaving @entity0 looking increasingly isolated			2
playing with fire : if @entity0 ends up with a 10 game ban then @entity9 could choose to terminate his deal @entity78 , president of the @entity79 in @entity69 , said : ‘ it ( the charge ) seems severe to me because this gesture only has an anti-semitic connotation if the gesture is made in front of a synagogue or memorial to the @entity88			1
‘ when it is made in a place that is not specifically @entity68 it seems to me that it is a slightly anarchic gesture of revolt against the establishment			0
’ @entity0 has highlighted @entity78 ’s words on @entity23 , saying : ‘ i therefore ask the @entity2 to kindly remove the charge made against me			2
and i repeat : i am not anti-semitic or racist			0
’ @entity78 was then asked to confirm his stance in a later interview but said the gesture was initially conceived as anti-semitic and that the player ’s sympathy for it was ‘ clearly suspect ’			2
@entity69 comedian @entity102 , who originated the quenelle gesture , has been questioned by police after bailiffs alleged they were fired on with rubber bullets at his house west of @entity108			1
salute : the ' quenelle ' gesture originated from @entity0 's friend , the @entity69 comedian @entity113 distanced : @entity9 sponsors @entity114 have decided not to extend their deal at the end of the season meanwhile , two more of @entity9 ’s commercial partners may follow the example of sponsors @entity114 - a property website and part of the @entity123 , a privately held company whose shareholders include @entity126 , a division of @entity127 plc , the company which owns the @entity128 and @entity129 - who officially ended their two - year deal			1
@entity133 clothing company @entity132 and @entity134 are both monitoring the situation			0
a statement issued by @entity132 read : ‘ we consider the charges as serious and strongly disapprove of any gestures or statements which are meant to discriminate a single person or certain group of people			0
‘ we are now awaiting the judgement of the @entity2 before taking further steps			0
depending on what @entity9 say ... we would consider ending our sponsorship as one option			2
’ december 28 , 2013 after scoring in @entity9 ’s 3 - 3 draw at @entity20 , striker @entity0 celebrates by making the quenelle — an inverted @entity34 salute created by his friend , controversial @entity69 comedian @entity153 — which has anti-semitic connotations			1
the gesture is relatively unknown in the @entity156 but there is an angry reaction in @entity69 with the country ’s sports minister calling @entity0 ’s actions ‘ disgusting ’			1
headline : @entity163 called for @entity0 to be kicked out for the gesture december 29 @entity0 says on @entity165 : ‘ i am neither racist nor anti-semitic			1
the meaning of quenelle is anti-system			0
i do not know what religion has to do with this story			0
with regard to the ministers who give their own interpretations of my quenelle , they are the ones that create confusion			0
’ december 30 the @entity2 begins investigating the incident while @entity177 ’s @entity163 calls for @entity0 to be banned for knowingly bringing an anti-semitic gesture to a wider audience			1
january 10 , 2014 the @entity2 reveal that they are working with an ‘ appointed expert ’ as part of their investigations into @entity0 ’s quenelle			2
but the delay in making a decision is widely criticised			0
january 17 @entity9 ’s shirt sponsors @entity114 threaten to end their £ 3million deal unless @entity0 is axed			1
they say they will remove the @entity114 name from the home shirts if he is picked for the next match			0
january 20 just hours before monday ’s kick - off against @entity193 , @entity114 , who have sponsored @entity9 since 2012 , announce that they will not renew their deal with the club at the end of the season as a result of @entity0 ’s gesture			1
defiant : a group performs the ' quenelle ' salutes in front of a theatre where @entity102 is performing when @entity9 striker @entity0 scored the first of his two goals in saturday 's 3 - 3 @entity65 draw at @entity20 , he celebrated by making a gesture largely unfamiliar to fans of @entity214 football			1
but the salute , known in @entity69 as ' la quenelle ' , is the subject of a fierce national debate that has reached the @entity69 interior ministry and stands accused of sparking a spate of attacks across @entity0 's homeland			1
here , we explore the origins of the controversial gesture and the motives of its self - proclaimed inventor , the stand - up comedian and political activist @entity113 : ' @entity231 ' or ' dumpling ' and is performed by holding one arm straight by one 's side while touching that arm 's shoulder with the opposite hand			2
it has been described by its critics as a ' @entity34 salute in reverse ' and , thusly , as an expression of @entity244			0
forty - seven - year - old @entity113 , who goes by the stage name of @entity102 , has turned the ' quenelle ' into something of a viral trend since first performing it four years ago			0
once a committed anti-racism campaigner , @entity102 has since been linked to the political far right in @entity69			2
@entity69 interior minister @entity252 is considering banning all public performances by the comedian			2
in the wake of @entity0 's public use of the gesture , which the player stated was simply a ' special dedication ' to his good friend @entity102 , @entity69 minister for sport @entity261 described his actions as ' shocking ' and ' disgusting '			1
@entity0 has previously been photographed performing the gesture alongside @entity102 but saturday 's events brought the debate to @entity214 while provoking further outrage and debate in @entity69 , where the match was televised			1
@entity102 , who has past convictions for making anti-semitic remarks , insists the ' quenelle ' is merely ' an anti-establishment gesture ' but his critics are concerned about its motivation			2
when @entity102 insulted @entity68 radio presenter @entity276 this week , @entity69 interior minister @entity252 vowed to use any legal means necessary to ban any future public appearances by the comedian			2
@entity252 told newspaper @entity280 : ' @entity102 has been repeatedly condemned for defamation , insult and incitement to racial hatred			0
he is a repeat offender and i intend to act with the greatest firmness , under the law			0
' the @entity2 is considering opening an investigation into the possible connotations of the salute			0
@entity292 rules state : ' 1			0
a ) anyone who offends the dignity of a person or group of persons through contemptuous , discriminatory or denigratory words or actions concerning race , colour , language , religion or origin shall be suspended for at least five matches			0
furthermore , a stadium ban and a fine of at least chf 20,000 shall be imposed			0
if the perpetrator is an official , the fine shall be at least chf 30,000			0

@entity0 insists the gesture was not meant to be anti-semitic
@entity9 striker faces a minimum five - game ban
@entity0 's ban could be doubled if he is still found guilty after appeal
