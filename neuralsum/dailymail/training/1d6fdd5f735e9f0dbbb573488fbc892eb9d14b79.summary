demands were growing last night for a judge - led inquiry into @entity4 ’s complicity in torture after a day of drama at @entity7			1
three days after a @entity11 @entity10 report revealed details of the @entity14 ’s barbaric interrogation techniques , mps demanded answers to disturbing questions about the @entity4 ’s role			1
senior figures from all major parties said the full truth must be known about the role played by @entity4 agents – and what the @entity23 knew about it			2
in a significant development , @entity26 broke ranks to say a full judicial inquiry may be needed			0
on a day of fast - moving developments , it emerged that : the @entity10 committee 's report revealed gruesome details about the @entity14 's torture programme , but all references to its allies such as @entity4 were redacted			1
pictured is a group of prisoners at @entity50 pressure has been mounting since tuesday for @entity4 to hold its own inquiry to uncover the unvarnished truth about its role in the so - called ‘ war on terror ’			1
the @entity10 committee revealed the most gruesome details about the @entity14 ’s torture programme , but all references to the role played by @entity11 ’s allies – including @entity4 – were redacted , despite them being passed information gleaned from the inhumane treatment			1
the explosive 499 - page report did not contain a single reference to @entity64 , @entity65 or @entity66 – the @entity4 base from which rendition flights are known to have taken place			2
in advance of its publication , there were 22 meetings between the @entity10 committee and the @entity4 ’s ambassador to @entity78			1
it has now emerged mrs may , who has oversight of @entity64 , also met with the committee			0
home secretary @entity84 , who has oversight of @entity64 , met with the @entity10 committee prior to the report 's publication crucially , @entity87 – who was the security minister in the last @entity88 – also held talks			1
the spotlight is particularly intense on @entity88 , which was in power during the duration of the @entity14 ‘ enhanced interrogation ’ programme between 2001 and 2007			2
there are huge questions over not only what mr @entity97 personally knew , but also the roles played by ex-foreign secretaries @entity100 and @entity101			0
yesterday , @entity102 – who still has a strained relationship with his elder brother after beating him to the @entity88 leadership – said @entity101 would ‘ never ’ have knowingly allowed @entity4 agents to become involved in rendition and torture programmes run by the @entity14			1
asked whether his brother had questions to answer , mr @entity101 said : ‘ he answered questions about this in the @entity113 while he was in government			2
‘ he is never somebody who would ever countenance the @entity4 state getting engaged in this kind of activity			0
’ significantly , however , he described the @entity10 report as ‘ deeply troubling ’ – and declined to defend mr @entity97			2
mr @entity101 stopped short of backing calls for a judge - led inquiry – which could be hugely embarrassing for his brother – but last night mps on all sides said only a full investigation could get to the truth			2
@entity126 originally supported a judge - led inquiry and appointed sir @entity129 to take charge			0
however , amid huge controversy , the inquiry was scrapped last year before completion			0
instead , @entity135 ’s @entity134 has been tasked with the investigation – sparking fears of a whitewash			0
@entity88 mp @entity139 , a member of the home affairs select committee , said : ‘ it ’s essential that we have a full judge - led inquiry independent of political input			0
there are serious questions to be answered by @entity97 and @entity101 and others			0
’ there are huge questions over not only what former prime minister @entity97 ( pictured left ) personally knew about the @entity14 programme , but also the role played by ex-foreign secretary @entity101 ( right ) @entity156 mp @entity155 said the @entity14 torture methods were ‘ stomach - churning ’ , adding : ‘ there are huge question marks for @entity97 and his ministers			1
’ he said he would n’t trust the @entity134 ‘ to run a bath , much less an inquiry ’			0
ex-tory shadow home secretary @entity163 – who has accused @entity4 of time and again ‘ turning a blind eye ’ to @entity11 torture – said a judge - led inquiry should be reinstated , as mr @entity126 originally promised			1
the demand is backed by a string of human rights groups , including @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174			0
mr @entity26 said during his weekly @entity176 phone - in : ‘ once the police investigations are done , once the report from the @entity134 is done , we should keep an open mind , if we need to , about moving to a full judicial inquiry if there are any outstanding questions			0
’ a detainee from @entity185 is carried on a stretcher after being interrogated by military officials at @entity50 in 2002 @entity14 director @entity188 has refused to call the treatment of terror suspects torture			1
pictured is a prisoner being escorted in @entity50 mr @entity188 said the @entity14 was ‘ not prepared ’ to run the controversial programme and it ‘ failed to live up to the standards we set ourselves ’			1
but in a rare press conference , he refused to call the treatment of terror suspects torture and at no point said he would consider stepping down			0
mr @entity188 said he wanted to remind the world that after the 9/11 attacks , @entity11 ’s ‘ hearts were ripped open ’ and that the @entity11 ‘ ached , it cried in pain ’			1
he said : ‘ there were no easy answers and whatever your views are ... this agency did a lot of things right			0
