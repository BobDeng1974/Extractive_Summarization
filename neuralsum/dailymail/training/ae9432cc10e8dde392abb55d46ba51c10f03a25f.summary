by @entity1 - rivers published : 07:07 est , 15 august 2012 updated : 07:17 est , 15 august 2012 dark chocolate is rich in flavanols , which can lower blood pressure - although these can also be found in blueberries , tomatoes and onions enjoying dark chocolate could have the added benefit of lowering blood pressure , researchers claim			1
a review of studies involving nearly a thousand people found those consuming up to 100g of chocolate with a high cocoa content had a significant drop in their blood pressure			1
researchers believe the antioxidant compound flavanol is the active ingredient providing heart benefits , according to a review published in the @entity27			1
these findings follow a study earlier this week suggesting that cocoa may benefit the brain in old age and protect against diseases such as @entity34 ’s			2
scientists reviewed data from 20 short - term trials in which 850 participants were involved and discovered those who consumed up to 100g of flavanol - rich chocolate or cocoa powder a day significantly reduced their blood pressure when compared to those who consumed flavanol - free products			1
@entity44 contains nitric oxide which causes blood vessels in the body to dilate and relax resulting in a drop in blood pressure			2
its health benefits were first recognised when it was revealed that indigenous people who drank cocoa every day from @entity54 in @entity55 have normal blood pressure regardless of age			0
@entity58 is found in much higher concentrations in dark than milk chocolate			1
@entity62 @entity61 , professor @entity63 said : ‘ increasing your flavanol intake may be beneficial if you have a high blood pressure however i would n’t recommend it for people suffering from cardiovascular diseases who should stick to traditional treatments			0
’ people with high blood pressure , which affects 1 in 3 adults in the @entity62 , are three times more likely to develop heart disease and stroke than those with a healthy blood pressure			0
ideally adults ’ blood pressure should be below 140/85 mmhg			0
around 30 per cent of people in @entity85 have high blood pressure , which increases the risk of heart attack and stroke the top number measures systolic pressure , which corresponds to the surge of blood that occurs with every heartbeat			0
the results of the study show that flavanol - rich chocolate reduced blood pressure by up to 4 mmhg of systolic pressure which could make a difference for someone with high blood pressure who may need medication			2
but do n’t reach for the chocolate bar just yet - flavanol can also be found in diet friendly foods such as blueberries , tomatoes and onions as well as green tea			1
professor @entity63 adds : ‘ i would also prioritise restricting salt in your diet if you are trying to lower your blood pressure as the data from these studies are more powerful			0
’ additionally the amount of flavanol varies greatly depending on the type of chocolate , which means milk chocolate lovers may be disappointed			1
high cocoa content , low sugar chocolate came out top in terms of reducing blood pressure with overweight and obese participants experiencing greater reductions in blood pressure after consuming low sugar chocolate			2
lead researcher @entity133 , from the @entity134 of @entity135 in @entity136 , @entity132 said : ‘ the small reduction we saw over the short term might complement other treatment options and might contribute to reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease			0
‘ we ’ll also need to see long term trials , including effects on the risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease , before we can come to conclusions regarding clinical outcomes and potential side effects of long - term consumption			0

@entity58 is the key ingredient and is found in much higher concentrations in dark than milk chocolate
