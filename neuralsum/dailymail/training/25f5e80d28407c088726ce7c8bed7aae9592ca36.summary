by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 11 may 2013 updated : 18:02 est , 11 may 2013 why do lighthouses so fascinate people ? despite the fact that they are located on remote coastlines and are impractical to live in , a pack of prospective buyers queue up whenever one comes on the market			0
this question is one that @entity11 , 54 , is in a good position to answer			0
he is selling @entity15 lighthouse on the north - east coast of @entity17 in @entity18 , where he has lived with his wife @entity19 , 46 , and their two adult children for 11 years			1
bright home : the @entity15 on @entity17 is on the market for £ 1.3million and comes with a fully functioning light as well as three cottages ‘ there ’s so much more to a lighthouse than a normal house , ’ says @entity11 , who works in education administration			1
‘ there ’s all the history that comes with it , and there ’s an air of mystery and danger about being on a little bit of land confronting the sea			0
’ @entity11 ’s own story of how he came to buy this lighthouse is a romantic one			1
it began in the 1980s when he and @entity19 would come to @entity17 on holidays			1
‘ we would walk by the headland and we ’d always talk about what it would be like to live in the lighthouse – it was special to us , ’ he recalls			1
‘ then , in 2002 , @entity19 saw it was for sale			0
we just had to have it			0
’ financially , it seemed like a madcap idea			0
the lighthouse , which was on the market for £ 230,000 , came with three keepers ’ cottages but these dwellings were virtually falling down and they were not allowed to live in the lighthouse tower itself			1
when @entity11 bought it , he had to lease it back to @entity64 and @entity65 at a peppercorn rent so that they could maintain it			0
@entity70 lifestyle : the 1,000 - watt lamp at @entity15 lighthouse is encased in a circular room in the front of the building and is on 24 - hours a day romance in the lighthouse : the bedroom in the main house on the property the lighthouse is still in use			1
the 1,000 - watt lamp shines for nine seconds out of every ten , 24 hours a day			1
its beam can be seen for 18 nautical miles			0
@entity11 spent £ 700,000 restoring the cottages , rented two of them out as holiday homes and lived in the third with his family			1
all three cottages have three bedrooms			1
@entity11 charges £ 350 a week in the low season and £ 950 in high season for the two holiday homes			1
the lettings made a gross profit of £ 42,000 last year			1
while other holiday cottages can be difficult to let out in winter , he found plenty of interest at this time of the year because holidaymakers are keen to witness the dramatic storms that lash this stretch of the coast around @entity105 time			1
as a result , he found he was able to let out the cottages for 40 to 45 weeks of the year			2
but @entity15 has always been more than a simply an investment to @entity11			0
over the years he has become obsessed – ‘ to the point of nerdiness ’ – with everything to do with lighthouses			0
he has joined the @entity113 , an organisation of like - minded enthusiasts that runs visits to lighthouses around the country			2
he has also researched @entity15 ’s history with academic diligence , finding the grave of its first keeper , a certain captain @entity122 , in the nearby @entity125 churchyard			0
spot on : point @entity126 on its headland in @entity125 , @entity17 , from where its light can be seen for 18 nautical miles it transpires that as a young man in the 1750s , @entity122 was a pirate who caused havoc in the @entity134			1
@entity11 has also made contact with the son of a former keeper and the wife of another			0
‘ the curious thing is that both of them often walk around this way , ’ says @entity11			0
‘ it ’s as if the lighthouse continues to cast its spell over them			2
’ a number of lighthouses have gone on the market recently			0
@entity151 and @entity152 , on the east coast of @entity154 , sold for above their asking prices of £ 75,000 and £ 145,000 respectively			2
and along the @entity18 coast from @entity15 , at @entity159 in @entity160 , the @entity157 found a buyer at £ 90,000			1
as the tower is cut off from land at high tide , the new owners will experience the thrill of waves breaking all around them			0
as a permanent dwelling , it is unusable , having no mains services			0
anyone looking for a more realistic buy - to - let opportunity might be interested in the @entity173 at @entity174 in @entity175			2
currently used as two holiday lettings , its observation lounge in the former lens room gives fantastic views over the islands of @entity182 and @entity183			0
it is for sale for £ 975,000			2
@entity15 ’s price of £ 1.375 million is obviously going to put it beyond the budget of many people			2
would it be possible to buy the cottages individually ? ‘ i ’d be reluctant to split them up because they are worth more as a single business than as separate cottages , ’ says @entity11 , who is leaving to take up a new job in @entity192			2
‘ also , there is a reason why there are three keepers ’ cottages here			1
‘ in the 1800s there were two keepers at the @entity204 off @entity205 and one of them died			2
the other tied the dead body in some tarpaulin and hung the corpse outside the window			0
‘ by the time the survivor was picked up , he had been driven raving mad and the authorities stipulated that every lighthouse in the country must be manned by three keepers			1
‘ to break up the three cottages would be going against this old lighthouse keepers ’ code			1
