by @entity0 payday loans company @entity1 has been accused of ' censorship by stealth ' after using legal threats to remove a work of parody from the internet			1
twitter user @ @entity10 posted an image showing an 18th - century debtors ' prison , with the @entity1 logo superimposed , including the mock catchphrase ' your soul is ours '			1
the image was highlighting widespread anger at the loans company , which offers loans at representative annual interest rates of 5853 per cent			2
legal threats : @entity1 took legal action over this image , which superimposes a character from its adverts onto a scene of a debtors ' prison and in a bizarre move , @entity1 then called its own legal team ' soulless ' for trying to suppress the image , which has now been posted hundreds more times in protest			1
it features a painting by @entity36 , an artist famous for depicting social decay in the 1700s , with the head of one of @entity1 's puppet - like tv advert characters superimposed on a figure			1
the @entity1 mascot is surrounded by wretched and impoverished captives in @entity46 's @entity45 , where hundreds of people who owed money were subjected to cruel punishments			1
the original image is part of a @entity36 series called a @entity53 , which shows the rise and fall of a wealthy man who squanders his fortune and ends up destitute			2
the legal notice , delivered by @entity58 , is signed by representative @entity59 from the legal department of @entity1 's parent company			1
it accuses the owner of the @entity58 account of infringing the company 's copyright by using part of its adverts			2
ads : the above image has been doctored to include ' @entity72 ' , a puppet character who often features in @entity1 's adverts original : the famous scene shows wretched figures stuck in @entity45 , where debtors were sent in the 1700s the text of the warning identifies ' infringing acts ' on the grounds that @entity1 did not give its permission for the images to be used			1
however it has been claimed that the legal complaint is baseless and that the company is simply using its legal muscle to quash dissent			0
speaking to @entity93 the @entity58 user , who declined to be named , said the legal complaint was a ' pretext '			1
the image seized upon for the parody is one of an eight - part series by @entity36 depicting the rise and fall of a wealthy man			2
@entity102 , the central figure , inherits from his miserly father and proceeds to spend all the money on his lavish lifestyle			0
he quickly squanders all his money on clothes , women and parties , landing him in @entity45 , which is the penultimate frame of the series			0
@entity102 can be seen surrounded by angry creditors , while his wife and lover languish in the corner			0
in the next picture he has been driven insane and languished in the @entity119 lunatic asylum			0
hundreds of years later the pictures inspired @entity121 to writer an opera of the same name			0
they are currently housed in sir @entity127 's museum in @entity46			0
he said : ' wonga have decided to take this aggressive approach to squashing any parody or criticism of their company , using the pretext of copyright abuse			0
' i think there 's an important point of principle here			0
if they get away with this , it 's the beginning of censorship by stealth on @entity58			1
' i 've taken advice and it 's been pointed out that @entity1 are on really rocky ground with this			0
but if it came to the crunch it would mean traipsing over to a @entity150 court and i have n't got the time or the money to go there			0
' of course the whole thing has rebounded on them			0
they 're getting so much adverse publicity , and everybody has started retweeting it			0
' when contacted by the @entity93 for comment , @entity1 refused to explain why it took the action , beyond referencing a tweet which described its own lawyers as ' soulless '			1
a post on the @entity58 feed responding to an outcry about the move said : ' what can we say ? our lawyers are a soulless bunch and take the protection of our brand very seriously			1
' although @entity1 only recently decided to take action , the image in question was first published in january this year for a satirical competition			2
' aggressive ' : the take - down notice sent to the @entity58 user accuses him of copyright infringements the complaint was prompted by the image being uploaded again on april 6 , which led to the take - down notice being submitted yesterday			1
prominent figures including the archbishop of @entity187 have attacked the company for the way it treats its customers , who are often left in severe financial difficulty			0
last year @entity193 said he told @entity1 's boss that the @entity195 aimed to ' compete you out of existence ' by backing community - based lending schemes instead , with lower interest rates			2
@entity1 was in the spotlight again this week after the @entity201 banned an advert designed to explain away the huge 5853 per cent interest rates			2
the ad , which attempted to demonstrate how consumers would never actually pay thousands of per cent of interest on the loans because they are too short - term , was deemed to be confusing and that @entity1 was being ' irresponsible ' in trying to distract attention from the high rates			1
response : @entity1 called its own lawyers ' soulless ' for sending the warning			1

twitter user created parody comparing payday loans to debtors ' prison
but @entity1 lawyers tried to remove it from @entity58 and sent legal warning
it has now been accused of ' censorship by stealth ' over the complaint
also claims that its legal grounds are *incorrect* - and just a pretext
when asked to explain , @entity1 bizarrely called its own lawyers ' soulless '
the image has since been *re-posted* hundreds of times by other users
