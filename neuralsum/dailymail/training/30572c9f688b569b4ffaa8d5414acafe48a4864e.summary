when astronomers first discovered huge sand dunes on @entity3 a decade ago , they were baffled by their discovery - because @entity3 's winds were thought to be too timid to create them			1
but now scientists , using a wind tunnel on @entity9 , have discovered a remarkable process may be taking place that explains how they formed			0
based on their research , the team discovered that on rare occasions the winds suddenly change direction and increase their speed by 50 per cent - but why they do this is , in itself , a new mystery			1
scientists in @entity22 have found an explanation for sand dunes on @entity3			1
they say the moon 's winds occasionally reverse and increase in speed			1
in this image the dark lines are dunes crawling across the surface of @entity3 , @entity33 's largest moon of the more than 150 moons in the solar system , @entity3 is the only one known to have an atmosphere , and in turn winds , on its surface			1
it also has windswept dunes on its surface that are more than a mile ( 1.6km ) wide , hundreds of miles long and up to 300 feet ( 90 metres ) high - about the size of @entity42			2
but the appearance of the dunes on the surface was a mystery , as not only were the winds thought to be too weak , but they also formed in the opposite direction to @entity3 's steady east - west wind			1
the latest research could finally explain this puzzling mystery of @entity3 - and it may explain winds on other bodies as well			1
the experiment was carried out by a team of scientists using a high - pressure wind tunnel at @entity60 's @entity59			1
on @entity3 , where the surface temperature is -180 째 @entity63 ) , the ' sand ' is probably unlike sand on @entity9 , @entity65 or @entity66			2
from the @entity69 observations and other data , scientists think it is composed of small particles of solid hydrocarbons ( or ice wrapped in hydrocarbons ) , with a density about one - third that of terrestrial sand			2
in addition , @entity3 's gravity is low , roughly one - seventh that on @entity9			1
combined with the particles ' low density , this gives them a weight of only about four per cent that of terrestrial sand , or roughly as light as freeze - dried coffee grains			0
after two years of many models and recalibrations , the team discovered that the minimum wind on @entity3 had to reach speeds of 3.2mph ( 5.1kph ) to move the sand			2
but this is 50 per cent faster than the average speed of wind on @entity3 's surface - suggesting their must be a hidden process taking place			1
' our models started with previous wind speed models , but we had to keep tweaking them to match the wind tunnel data , ' said dr @entity102 from the @entity103			0
' we discovered that movement of sand on @entity3 's surface needed a wind speed that was higher than what previous models suggested			1
' from the experiment , and other atmospheric models , it has been deduced that the wind must reverse twice during a @entity33 year - which is about 30 @entity9 years			0
the reversal happens when the sun crosses over @entity3 's equator , causing its atmosphere - and the winds - to shift			1
this not only causes the wind to blow in the opposite direction - west to east - but also increases its speed by the required 50 per cent , for reasons unknown			1
and the shift must occur very briefly , according to @entity125 , which may explain why the @entity69 spacecraft currently in orbit around the @entity33 system has not been able to detect this atmospheric phenomenon			0
of the more than 150 moons in the solar system , @entity3 is the only one known to have an atmosphere , and , in turn winds , on its surface			0
it is seen here , covered in thick clouds , approaching the limb of @entity33 ( upper left ) , by the @entity69 as it approached the @entity33 system the latest experiment was carried out by a team of scientists using a high - pressure wind tunnel , shown , at @entity60 's @entity59			2
they used 23 different types of sand to come to the conclusion that wind speeds on the moon must occasionally increase in order to create the dunes dunes begin to form when the wind picks up loose particles from the ground and drives them downwind			1
a key part of understanding dunes is to identify the threshold wind speed that causes dune particles to start to move			0
geologists have found threshold speeds for sand and dust under various conditions on @entity9 , @entity65 and @entity66			0
but for @entity3 , with its bizarre conditions , this had remained unknown - until now			0
the scientists led by @entity125 began their study with carefully designed wind tunnel experiments			0
' we refurbished the high - pressure wind tunnel previously used to study conditions on @entity66 , ' dr @entity170 of @entity60 explained			0
@entity3 's windswept dunes on its surface are more than a mile ( 1.6km ) wide , hundreds of miles long and up to 300 feet ( 90 metres ) high - about the size of @entity42 ( stock image shown ) the high - pressure wind tunnel at @entity60 's @entity59 , shown , was originally built to simulate winds at the surface of @entity66 , where atmospheric pressures are about 90 times greater than on @entity9			1
after modifications , it became the @entity183 to recreate in the tunnel on @entity9 the wind conditions on @entity3 , the scientists had to increase the air pressure in the wind tunnel to about 12 times the surface pressure of @entity9			2
with its thick atmosphere and organic - rich chemistry , @entity3 resembles a frozen version of @entity9 several billion years ago , before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere			0
because @entity3 is smaller than @entity9 , its gravity does n't hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly , so the atmosphere extends 370 miles ( 595 kilometres ) into space			0
as on @entity9 , the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons , although the seasons on @entity3 are about seven @entity9 years long			0
@entity3 's ' water ' is liquid methane , @entity209 , better known on @entity9 as natural gas			2
regular @entity9 - water , @entity212 , would be frozen solid on @entity3 where the surface temperature is @entity214 ( -292 째 f )			0
with @entity3 's low gravity and dense atmosphere , methane raindrops could grow twice as large as @entity9 's raindrops			2
as well as this , they would fall more slowly , drifting down like snowflakes			0
but scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades			0
dr @entity102 dedicated six years to refurbishing the defunct @entity225 high - pressure wind tunnel to recreate @entity3 's surface conditions			1
she and her team then turned up the tunnel 's pressure to simulate @entity3 's dense atmosphere , turned on the wind tunnel fan , and studied how the experimental sand behaved			1
because of uncertainties in the properties of sand on @entity3 , they used 23 different varieties in the wind tunnel to capture the possible sand behaviour on @entity3			2
and they compensated for the low density of @entity3 ' sand ' and the moon 's reduced gravity through numerical modeling			1
for simplicity , the wind - tunnel modeling ignored some factors , among them whether @entity3 dune particles are sticky			2
if they are , the paper 's scientists note , then it will take yet - stronger winds to get the particles moving , and the contrasts will be even greater between the normal east wind pattern and the stronger west winds that shape the dunes			1
the new results should help in understanding atmospheric forces on other icy moons and planets with very thin or thick atmospheres , such as @entity267 's @entity266 , @entity268 or on comets			0
they can also help us better understand movement of particles in fluids in general			0
particle flows are important in a wide range of situations , including coal - mine or grain - elevator dust explosions , environmental pollution and lubricants			0
@entity69 radar has previously seen sand dunes on @entity33 's @entity3 ( upper photo ) that are sculpted like @entity287 sand dunes on @entity9 ( lower photo )			1
the bright features in the upper radar photo are not clouds but topographic features among the dunes			0

scientists in @entity22 have found an explanation for sand dunes on @entity3
they say the moon 's winds occasionally reverse and increase in speed
the appearance of the 300 - foot - high dunes had been a mystery , because winds on the moon were too slow to create them
now scientists think @entity3 's wind occasionally increases in speed by 50 *%*
and the wind also reverses direction , *allowing* the huge dunes to form
but , the reason for this change remains an *unsolved* mystery
