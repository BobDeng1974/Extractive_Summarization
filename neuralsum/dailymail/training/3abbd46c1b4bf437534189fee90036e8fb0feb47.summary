by @entity0 a border terrier with a damaged front leg has been given a new lease of life after her owner bought her a state of the art wheelchair			1
@entity7 , whose leg was shattered after her mother stood on her when she was just a few weeks old , spent the first seven years of her life hopping around on just three legs			1
but her owner , @entity12 , 58 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , found out about a pet wheelchair specialist based in @entity16 , and ordered a custom - built set of wheels for the lame dog			1
after some time getting used to them , @entity7 realised what the wheels were for , and is now bounding around like a puppy			2
' we picked @entity33 because of her disability and i made a deal with the breeder that i would raise her as a normal dog			0
' she was a beautiful little dog , very confident , and by no means the runt of the litter			0
' but as the years went by , mrs @entity12 and her husband , @entity58 , 71 , noticed that their pet was having more trouble getting around			1
mrs @entity12 said : ' she had always been a very active dog , and used to do everything regardless of her disability			2
' but if her good leg gave up , she would n't be able to get around			0
so it was potentially life - limiting for her			0
' the couple discovered @entity69 firm @entity68 online , and sent them @entity7 's measurements before paying £ 360 for a two - wheeled strap - on cart that fitted their beloved pet			1
in clover : @entity7 took some getting used to her new wheels but then she realised what they were for the wheels : @entity7 's £ 360 wheelchair is simple to strap her into and supports her chest with the straps doggy bag : when the @entity84 are in a rush , they strap @entity33 into a backpack and carry her it 's quite uncommon to have wheels on the front legs - i think she is one of only two dogs in the country to have them , ' mrs @entity12 said			1
' @entity33 has had her cart now for five years , and it has enormously improved her life , ' she said			0
' it has been a learning curve for her and she is still learning new tricks - but once she realised what the wheels were for she was fantastic on them			0
' now the couple want to spread the word so that other disabled pets can benefit , too			0
' the more people who know about what can be done for disabled animals , the better , ' mrs @entity12 said .			2

hope the border terrier 's front leg was broken when her mother stood on it
she was bought by @entity113 and @entity114 , from @entity13 , @entity14
they *promised* the breeder they would bring her up like any other terrier
@entity7 hopped around on three legs for years , but by seven was getting tired
mrs @entity12 went online and found a @entity69 *company* that made wheels for dogs
£ 360 later , and @entity33 is now *gambolling* like a puppy on her new front wheels
