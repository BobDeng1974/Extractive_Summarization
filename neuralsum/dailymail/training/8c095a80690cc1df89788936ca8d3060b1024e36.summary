pay rise : new @entity3 boss @entity6 ( left ) will earn 14 per cent or £ 80,000 more than his predecessor sir @entity14 who is standing down next year furious unions said the enormous rise was ‘ an extraordinary decision ’ and ‘ an insult to passengers ’ suffering expensive , delayed and overcrowded services , urging @entity3 to get off the ‘ gravy train ’			1
