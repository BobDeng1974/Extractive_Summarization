the lines between fantasy and reality are becoming ever more blurred with the army 's latest helmet design , which appears to have been inspired by a similar type of headgear used in the @entity9 video game franchise			0
@entity11 researchers have developed new ways for soldiers ’ helmets to provide better protection and comfort and have even introduced head - up displays and night vision goggles			1
four years was spent developing the gear to better integrate protective materials , liners and heads - up display technologies and communications			1
helmet of the future : revision , a company best known for ballistic eyewear has expanded protection to the head , neck and face in the form of its new modular helmet system flexible : taking a standard @entity11 helmet , and adding a ballistic visor and a mandible that offers 9mm protection , the system is intended for both mounted and dismounted soldiers inspiration : it looks as though the idea for the @entity11 's new helemet came from the @entity9 combat warfare computer game series a face shield shield has also been introduced because of the high number of facial injuries in recent wars caused by roadside bombs			1
‘ because of face injuries from rocks , glass and fragments from improvised explosive devices , there has been a call for increased protection ’ said @entity54 , who leads the project at @entity56 , in @entity57			0
@entity54 cited a @entity66 and @entity67 in combat report that said of all the injuries to the head , 72 percent are to the face			0
@entity73 ’s project is called the @entity74 , or heads - up			2
where fiction meets reality : it 's easy to see where the @entity11 took their inspiration from when you look at the video game @entity9 top secret : it ¿ s the culmination of a four - year research project at @entity56 called @entity74 and @entity86 plugins : the helmet can attach to a cellphone in order for the soldier to receive up - to - date information on their display developed by ballistic eyewear company revision , the modular heads - up system is composed of a standard @entity11 helmet with expanded features that protect the head , neck and face			1
the add - ons include a see - through ballistic visor and a mandible face mask that protects against 9 - mm ammunition and offers better eye , face and hearing protection than existing helmets			1
most notable are the display technologies that can be projected on the inside of the visor			2
though there are n’t any specifics on the projected displays yet , it ’s likely there will be images of battlefield maps , targets , health monitors , communications and other @entity123 - type of info			0
the concept is a single helmet to replace two helmets soldiers use , the @entity129 and the @entity130			0
upgrade : the helmet aims to provide a more fully integrated headgear system , making use of improved ballistic materials , non-ballistic impact liner materials and designs revolution : the @entity11 is testing a new helmet that looks like headwear from the ' @entity9 ' video game franchise			2
notable add - ons include a heads - up digital display on the visor features : an overall improved design with see - through and projected heads - up display technologies , and better eye , face and hearing protection @entity54 said that while this is ‘ in no way , shape or form the @entity11 ’s next helmet , ’ @entity73 will provide its research to the acquisition office for soldier equipment , @entity158 to help it develop future headgear			1
‘ we ’ve come up with tradeoffs , ideas , designs that the soldier will benefit from in the end , ’ @entity161 helmet also comes with add - ons and not every soldier would wear every piece designed for the headgear			1
for instance , a soldier who is in a vehicle ’s gun turret and therefore vulnerable would be able to add more protection			0
research at @entity73 focused not only on materiel but biomechanics in an effort to improve the fit , balance and weight of the helmets			0
the heads - up display provides soldiers with live targeting , gps battle mapping , text communication from mission commanders , live video from surveillance drones and general battle status display			2
the helmet is powered by a phone and so is fully upgradable with new apps .			0
