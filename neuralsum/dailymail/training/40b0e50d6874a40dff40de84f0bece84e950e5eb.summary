by @entity0 published : 02:18 est , 17 may 2013 updated : 04:51 est , 17 may 2013 a custard pie fight has been cancelled - because no insurer will cover the ' dangerous ' event that is classified as a ' sport '			1
the flan flinging free - for - all was scheduled to close the first @entity6 , held in the @entity8 town which is home to the famous cherry - topped cake			2
but mayor @entity10 has been unable to find an insurer to cover the event because it is ' too dangerous '			1
in the 1976 film @entity14 , a custard pie fight made everyone realise they could be friends			0
insurers told people in @entity20 ( famous for its tarts ) they are seen as dangerous he said : ' i have rung round dozens of insurance companies - none of which will cover this event as it is classed as a sport			1
' but really - how can a paper plate and some custard foam be more dangerous than horse riding or rugby or even crossing the road ? it 's a classic case of world gone mad			2
' these insurance companies are really damaging our country and taking all the pleasure out of being alive			0
' i 'm surprised there is n't rioting in the streets			0
' @entity20 , a picturesque town in the @entity46 , is famous for its confectioneries , including the @entity49 and the @entity50 - a flan stuffed with egg and almonds			1
the pie fight in @entity20 , @entity8 , has been cancelled as no one will insure it the planned custard scrap on june 9 was named the ' mr @entity57 ' in tribute to @entity59 , who penned @entity60 in the town			1
teams were meant to protect their own ' mr @entity57 ' and the winner would have been whoever was the last to be splattered with pie			0
organisers have even taken to @entity68 to appeal for help in getting the event insured			2
they wrote : ' who would have thought that a paper plate and some custard foam could be so hazardous			0
' we 're having trouble finding an insurance company willing to insure this ' incredibly dangerous ' event			1
unbelievable ! ' so if anyone knows of or is an insurer willing to take on the mr. @entity79 fight please contact us			0

event classified as a sport - and no company will insure it
@entity20 mayor @entity10 has been unable to find an insurer
