@entity0 cost his tv daughter her chance at winning @entity3 , but not because of the current rape scandal			1
actress @entity5 , best known for playing the comedian 's daughter @entity8 on @entity9 , was fired by @entity10 for not hitting her tv dad up for a bake sale donation			1
in the last few months , more than two dozen women have come forward to accuse @entity0 of rape - but sunday night 's episode was shot more than a year before			1
nevertheless , the conversation surrounding @entity0 in the boardroom caused a few minutes of awkward television - as @entity10 called @entity0 a ' tremendous guy ' and a ' gentleman '			1
the episode was shot a year ago , before scores of women came forward to accuse @entity0 of rape and sexual assault			1
@entity32 dad : @entity5 is best known for playing @entity33 on @entity0 's long - running sitcom @entity9			1
a young @entity5 pictured sitting on @entity0 lap , bottom left @entity5 was named her team 's project manager for the episode , and was put on the chopping block when they came up short in fundraising			1
in the boardroom , @entity5 's teammates ( including @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 ) turned on her and blamed her for not calling up @entity0 in front of judge @entity10 , his daughter @entity52 and guest judge @entity51 ( @entity50 's editor - at - large and the 2008 @entity3 champion )			1
' did you call @entity0 ? ' @entity10 asked a tearful @entity5 in the tense meeting			1
i have not talked to @entity0 on the phone in i do n't know how long , ' @entity5 explained			1
' so for me to pick up the phone , having not talked to you for five years , except for when we run into each other for a @entity0 event - i feel that 's not my place to do			2
' @entity10 disagrees , saying a big donation to the sale would have been nothing for a ' tremendous guy ' like @entity0 with a ' tremendous amount of money ' - enough to win the task with one phone call			1
he told @entity5 : ' you are an amazing person , but you were the project manager			2
you did n't make one call that i really believe that if you 'd called that gentleman he would have helped you , even if you had n't spoken to him in years			0
' you were an amazing team with one of the most successful shows ever , so i think it would have been a good call to make for charity			0
you have to take responsibility			0
' blame game : @entity5 's ( left ) teammates ( including @entity44 , second left ; @entity46 , second right ; and @entity45 , right ) threw her under the bus in the boardroom for not trying to solicit money from @entity0 in the fundraiser , in which they came up short who to fire ? guest judge @entity51 ( @entity50 's editor - at - large and a former champion of the reality show , left ) and @entity10 's daughter @entity52 ( right ) also weighed in on the decision of who to fire with that , @entity10 made his signature hand move and sent @entity5 packing			1
he did , however , make a $ 25,000 donation to her charity from his own pocket			0
his advisor @entity51 said he had made the right decision			0
he said : ' you go head to head with @entity107 and you only bring in $ 8000 yourself ? suicide			0
' @entity5 , however , disagreed , saying : ' to send me home for a fundraising task where the other two people raised zero dollars is kind of crazy to me			2
' tv blog @entity112 , which recapped the episode , pointed out how strange it was that the scene was n't edited to remove the praise of @entity0 , even though @entity10 and everyone else in the boardroom were clearly unaware of the scandal when the episode was shot			1
immediately after the show 's premiere episode aired , @entity10 was quick to point out that it had been filmed before any women came forward with rape allegations against @entity0			1
' this show was taped just before the terrible @entity0 revelations came to light			2
she still should have asked him for money – goes to charity , ' he tweeted			0
scandal : in the past few months , more than two dozen woman have come forward to accuse @entity0 ( right ) of rape			1
these accusations have tarnished the comedian 's once - revered reputation as ' @entity139 's dad '			0
pictured above in a still from @entity9 , featuring @entity140 since the first episode of the @entity3 was filmed , more than 15 women have come forward claiming to have been drugged , sexually assaulted or both by @entity0			1
he has not been charged in connection with any of the allegations , most of which date back to the 1970s			0
sunday night 's premiere episode of the @entity3 saw a battle of the sexes as the all female team ' @entity151 ' took on the all male team ' @entity153 '			1
with @entity5 leading the women as project manager and journalist @entity157 stepping up to manage the men , the teams had the task of selling pies to raise money for charity			2
while the women opted to make an enchilada pie and a blackberry and pear pie , the men crafted a chocolate and vanilla pie alongside a low calorie chicken potpie			0
@entity172 @entity171 , actor @entity173 and @entity175 star @entity174 slaved away in the kitchen creating team @entity153 's products , but got off to a problematic star when @entity174 accidentally burned the crusts			2
while tensions rose between @entity171 and @entity107 , the men had dozens of contacts coming to their pie shop with huge donations			0
@entity171 's social media popularity also saw their store swarming with @entity188 fans			0
after the episode aired @entity10 too to @entity190 to clarify that it had been filmed before the allegations against @entity192 had ' come to light ' the men had dozens of contacts coming to their pie shop with huge donations			1
@entity171 ' social media popularity also saw their store swarming with @entity188 fans while baseball champ @entity197 and @entity199 star @entity198 encouraged people to visit the shop , comedian @entity196 organized some outside entertainment and actor @entity203 worked behind the counter			0
in the women 's shop , @entity206 snowboarder @entity205 and reality tv star @entity44 were in charge of cooking the pies , while their fellow contestants @entity46 , @entity45 , @entity212 , @entity213 and @entity214 tried to raise money and increase publicity on social media			2
@entity5 , who was hoping to win the task and raise money for her charity @entity221 , said : ' from the days on @entity9 and having that great example with mr. @entity0 , the importance of philanthropy and giving back to others has been a part of my life for forever			1
' @entity229 of @entity230 , however , was critical of her project manager when she learned she had not called her former on - screen father to ask for a donation			2
she said : ' @entity5 was a @entity0 kid			1
she was on one of the number one shows of all time and the first person she should be calling is @entity0			0
i know he has deep pockets			0
' she added : ' your tv dad is accessible to you and you do n't call him up for a donation ? that 's crazy			0
' @entity10 , @entity245 and @entity246 attend the @entity247 at @entity248 yesterday in the boardroom it was revealed that while team @entity151 had raised $ 93,862 – including a $ 25,000 bonus for having the best - tasting pie , team @entity153 had raised a staggering $ 185,322			2
winning project manager @entity107 took home $ 280,000 for his charity @entity253			0
threatened with the sack , the girls quickly turned on one another			0
@entity44 came under fire for raising no money at all and was called ' lazy ' by @entity212			0
' she stood around talking while we all did every job that we could , ' the housewife said			0
@entity230 , meanwhile , was critical of @entity5 , saying			0
' if i was @entity33 and i was @entity32 's favourite daughter , i would have called my tv dad for a contribution			1
' there were tears as @entity46 said she was ' proud ' of her project manager , but @entity5 fought back emotion and brought @entity44 and @entity205 back into the boardroom			0
despite @entity205 and @entity44 having raised no money between them , it was @entity5 who got the boot for failing to call @entity0 .			2
