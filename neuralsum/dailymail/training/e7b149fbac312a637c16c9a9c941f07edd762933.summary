by @entity0 published : 15:29 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 22:11 est , 13 january 2014 preacher man : former methodist pastor @entity3 is currently serving a life sentence for the murder of his second wife while awaiting trial in the murder of his first wife new details shed light on how a @entity13 pastor nicknamed the ' sinister minister ' staged a car accident to kill his second wife , as he started dating one of his married congregants			1
police in rural @entity19 , @entity13 started investigating methodist pastor @entity3 , after the october 2008 suicide of congregant @entity21 , who had recently learned that his wife @entity22 was having an affair with the pastor			1
while the pastor and his married mistress were ruled out as suspects in @entity21 's death , the suicide put enough attention on @entity3 that police decided to re-investigate the mysterious ' accidental ' deaths of his two wives			1
@entity3 's second wife @entity34 died in a car accident just three months before @entity21 's death , and his first wife @entity36 died falling down a set of stairs in 1999			1
@entity40 police detective @entity39 believes it was @entity3 's position in the church that kept him from suspicion			2
' who would suspect a minister of doing such , such awful things ? ' @entity43 told @entity47			0
@entity3 has since been charged with murder in both of his wives ' deaths			1
he was convicted of killing @entity34 , wife number two , last year and is currently serving a life sentence while awaiting trial for the death of his first wife , @entity36			1
a new @entity47 report sheds more light on @entity58 and @entity36 's gruesome deaths and how those close to the victims championed to bring @entity3 to justice			1
interest in @entity3 started with @entity21 's suicide in october 2008			1
questions : @entity3 's first wife @entity36 ( left ) died in 1999 after an alleged fall down the stairs while @entity34 died in a car crash which the disgraced pastor allegedly staged two years ago the church : @entity3 was pastor at @entity71 where @entity72 was found after committing suicide @entity21 has struggled with alcoholism his whole life and finally decided to turn to the church for solace			1
as a carpenter , he helped with repairs and jobs around the @entity81 where @entity22 , his wife of 18 years , worked and where @entity3 was pastor			2
it was @entity21 's daughter @entity84 who discovered the affair between her mother and their pastor after reading inappropriate text messages on her mother 's phone			1
' there was no doubt			0
it was n't ' i love you in @entity99 ' type of text message , ' ms @entity94 said			0
' not something that you 'd expect your employer to be sending you			0
she confronted @entity3 about the affair in an anonymous email , but somehow the pastor and her mother were able to trace the email back to her			2
caught : @entity94 discovered the affair between her mother and the pastor by reading inappropriate text messages between the two ' they took me into his office and told me that i was wrong , that nothing was going on and how dare i accuse them of an affair , ' she said			2
she believed them at first , but changed her mind when her father asked her if she knew about an affair			0
' and then he said , " does she love him ? " and i just said , " i think so			0
" that 's probably one of the most horrible things that you can hear , ' said @entity84			0
@entity21 confronted his wife and made her promise to end the affair , but soon learned she was making secret phone calls to the pastor behind his back			1
the day before he died , @entity22 took the kids to stay at her sister 's house and would n't let anyone answer her husband 's calls			0
justice : @entity138 pushed police to investigate the death of @entity3 's wives after learning about her brother 's suicide the next morning @entity84 checked her voicemail and found a message from her father saying ' if you love me at all , please call me back '			1
that same morning , @entity21 was found slumped over in a chair at the church , having shot himself while sitting behind the pastor 's desk he crafted			2
@entity152 turned to @entity3 as a possible suspect in @entity21 's death when sister @entity138 arrived in town for the memorial service			1
ms @entity138 found sister - in - law @entity22 's behavior strange , saying she seemed ' giddy ' in love with the pastor and totally unbothered by the deaths of his two wives			1
. while @entity3 and @entity22 were eventually ruled out as possible murderers in ms @entity94 's death , the suicide triggered investigators to take a second look into the deaths of @entity58 and @entity36			1
investigators first turned their attention to @entity34 's car crash and discovered several inconsistencies in @entity3 's side of the story			1
@entity173 discovered the wreck and said @entity3 seemed ' indifferent ' to his wife 's condition and had n't even called 911			2
@entity3 also gave out different stories about why his wife was n't wearing her seat belt , telling some that she had just readjusted to get comfortable while telling police she never put the seat belt on to begin with			2
@entity34 's grave state also did n't line up with the damage on the car			1
there were n't any skid marks on the road , no sign of braking and little damage to the front end of the car			0
the airbags had n't deployed and the car was functioning to the point that @entity3 could have backed up and driven his wife to the hospital			2
convicted : @entity3 was sentenced to life in prison for the 2008 murder of his wife @entity34 and will face trial for the death of first - wife @entity34 the blood stains in the car did n't make any sense either			1
blood stains were found on the passenger seat where @entity58 was sitting which would n't have happened had she started bleeding in the car			0
' if i 'm sitting in a car being thrown around there might be blood all around here , but there would n't be blood on my seat , ' @entity43 said			0
' and the fact that it was absorbed and saturated meant that she was … placed in it , ' he added			0
detectives got a warrant to search @entity3 's parsonage and that 's where they found the evidence that solidified their case blood drops stained the concrete right next to where the passenger door would open , and tests revealed that the blood belonged to @entity58			2
' she was bleeding prior to getting in that car			0
and she was assaulted and put in that car and placed in that car seat , ' @entity43 said			0
unmoved : @entity3 did n't even call 911 after getting into an ' accidental ' car wreck with second - wife @entity34 investigators continued to build up their case against @entity3 , but sped things up when he proposed to @entity22			1
@entity84 remembers getting the text message from her mom , telling her the news that he had bought her a ring			0
the very next thing @entity84 did was call police , afraid for her mother 's safety			2
' i was worried for her safety at that point , ' she replied			0
' she was gon na be wife number three			0
and the first two ... did n't have a whole lot of luck			0
' the @entity257 police agreed			0
in september 2010 , just a few weeks after @entity3 's proposal , he was arrested and charged with @entity34 's murder			1
with @entity3 safely in custody , police turned their attention to the pastor 's first wife			1
@entity36 , the mother of @entity3 's two daughters , died in 1999 after allegedly falling down a set of stairs in their @entity269 , @entity13 home while vacuuming			1
doctors initially pegged @entity36 's death to a heart attack , but the autopsy told a different story			1
dr @entity276 was the medical examiner who conducted the autopsy back then and he says he found it strange that the only injuries @entity36 suffered were several skull fractures			2
if she had actually fallen down the stairs , dr @entity276 says she would have had other broken bones below the neck so he classified her cause of death as ' undetermined '			0
' undetermined means it 's open ... and it certainly could be a homicide , ' dr @entity276 said			0
supporters : @entity3 's daughters @entity290 and @entity292 refuse to believe that their father killed their mother and step - mother at the time , he urged investigators to look more into the death , but they never did since it was n't considered suspicious			1
in september 2012 , while still in custody for @entity34 's murder , police had amassed enough evidence to charge @entity3 for @entity36 's murder			1
@entity3 faced trial for @entity34 's murder last year and the jury found him guilty of murder in the first degree			1
he was handed a life sentence without the possibility of parole and is currently waiting to stand trial in @entity36 's murder			1
despite the evidence against him , his daughters @entity290 and @entity292 still believe their father is innocent			0
and so does @entity22 , whom @entity3 was never able to marry			0
@entity3 's daughters say she has become a grandmother - like figure to their children who call her ' @entity317 ' now			2
meanwhile , @entity22 no longer has a relationship with her own daughter @entity84 who discovered the affair			0
' i do n't have a relationship with her , ' @entity84 said			0
' i ca n't really say that she is my mother			0
she is not the woman that raised me			0
… i wish she could see @entity3 for who he really is			0
' separated : @entity326 has become a part of @entity3 's family , despite never getting the change to marry him			2

@entity3 used to be the pastor at a @entity332 in rural @entity333 , @entity13
the deaths of his first and second wives were both considered tragic accidents until police took a second look in 2008
the suicide death of congregant @entity21 , whose wife was having an affair with @entity3 , *spurned* police to *reopen* the other two cases
while @entity3 was cleared of any wrong - doing in @entity21 's suicide , he was charged with murdering his wives
last year , @entity3 was convicted of @entity34 's death and is currently serving a life sentence while he waits to face trial in @entity36 's death
