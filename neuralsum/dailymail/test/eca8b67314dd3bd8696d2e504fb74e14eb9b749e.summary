‘ it was difficult to go in and speak to four members of staff who actually cried and broke down and were in fear of their personal safety within the classroom			2
‘ most people say : ‘ a six - year - old ? ’ but that six - year - old was able to break someone ’s arm			2
’ the woman had fallen while trying to restrain the boy , who had autism and behavioural problems , at the primary school in @entity53 , @entity23			2

he said : ‘ we ’ve been contacted recently where a member had to be rushed off to the local @entity62 ( @entity63 ) in @entity64 to have an emergency operation to reattach the top part of her finger because one of the students had kicked the door and caught her hand and took the top off the finger			2
’ the revelations were made at teachers ' union @entity7 ’s annual conference in @entity30 today ( general secretary , @entity77 , pictured ) mr @entity22 pointed out that under the @entity79 , employers must make sure as far as ‘ reasonably practical ’ that employees are protected			1
he said : ‘ at times , at some of the schools i visit , that is questionable			2
‘ as a union , we accept that most schools and colleges , remain relatively safe and secure , but we are seeing the increase of numbers of incidents within school : a minority of pupils who continue to challenge authority and behave disruptively , using threatening behaviour , abusive language and sometimes physical violence towards our members			1
’ he warned that some schools are ‘ continually reluctant ’ to impose sanctions such as exclusions because they do not want to inform their local authority or gain a ‘ bad reputation ’			2
mr @entity22 added : ‘ in a scenario recently when i looked at a school ’s behavioural system there were 1,200 behavioural issues that had been reported internally but only 12 had been reported to the authority			0
‘ according to the authority , that school was deemed as a good , well behaved school but we know that ’s not the case			0

‘ i was working in a department where a student stabbed another student in one of the classrooms , ’ he said			0
‘ we actually had as a school a procedure for that			0
in that school there was a tannoy system			0
‘ the tannoy system would talk about a @entity141 , and depending on how certain numbers were said about that @entity144 ’s lights being on , staff knew how to react in different ways			0
‘ but i ’m asking you , in your school is there an emergency protocol ? is there a facility in your school to lock your school down if necessary ? ’ @entity155 , a teacher from @entity156 , told the conference that a @entity158 ( @entity159 ) injured her back after a pupil pulled a chair from beneath her as a prank			0

she ’s still in a lot of pain			0
’ @entity175 , an @entity7 executive member for @entity176 , said some schools are operating a sliding scale discipline policy			1
this means that ‘ a pupil verbally abusing a main scale teacher will have a minor sanction ’			0
