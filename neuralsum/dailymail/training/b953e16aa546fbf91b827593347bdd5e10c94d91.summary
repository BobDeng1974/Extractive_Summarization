by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 's first cloned dog was created by a firm headed by a disgraced @entity6 scientist who falsely claimed to have successfully cloned a human embryo and produced stem cells from it			1
a 12 - year - old dachshund called @entity11 has become the first dog in @entity3 to be cloned , after owner @entity13 won a contest held by a @entity6 company - @entity15 - with the purpose of publicising its cloning technique			1
@entity15 ’s technology allowed a ‘ @entity21 ’ to be spawned , genetically identical to the original , but pupped by an unrelated animal			0
the cloned puppy was born thanks to @entity24 , a firm headed by @entity26 ( right )			1
in 2010 a @entity6 court sentenced him to 18 months in prison for embezzling research funds and illegally buying human eggs but @entity24 's dr @entity26 is currently serving a suspended prison term on criminal charges related to faked research			1
in 2010 a @entity6 court sentenced @entity26 to 18 months in prison for embezzling research funds and illegally buying human eggs			1
but the court suspended the penalty			2
the @entity40 made that ruling final in february			0
he will stay free unless he breaks laws in the next two years			0
@entity26 scandalised the international scientific community in 2005 when his breakthrough human cloning research involving embryonic stem cells was found to have been faked			1
@entity26 later admitted the data was faked but claimed he had been deceived by a fellow researcher			1
a piece of skin was taken from @entity11 and transported to @entity51 and a cell from that skin sample was placed inside a hollowed - out egg and electricity was used to spark fertilisation			0
then the embryo was implanted inside a mongrel dog that acted as a surrogate womb			1
the cloned puppy was born via @entity61 on march 30 , weighing just over 1lb			2
it must spend the first six months of its life in quarantine before it can begin living with @entity13			1
in 2006 , dr @entity26 was fired from his professorship at @entity68 and in may that year was charged with fraud and embezzlement			1
@entity26 and his former colleagues created the world 's first cloned dog , @entity74 , in 2005 , and that achievement was independently confirmed			1
after being stripped of the rights to conduct stem cell research due to the scandal , @entity26 has been focusing on cloning dogs , coyotes and other animals , offering the £ 60,000 procedure as part of a competition			1
viewers of @entity88 ’s documentary the £ 60,000 puppy last night saw @entity13 , 30 , and her family close to tears as they described how the original @entity11 ’s affectionate personality and doggy optimism had helped them through a nightmare of mental illness			1
‘ without @entity11 i do n’t know where you ’d be , ’ @entity13 ’s mother told her earnestly			2
‘ @entity11 has saved you			0
’ the dachshund was an 18th birthday present for @entity13 , at a time when she was ‘ having lots of demons ’			2
the pet helped her overcome the eating disorder she had struggled with for years			0
now , with their beloved @entity11 elderly and arthritic , the @entity105 faced a sorrowful parting that confronts all dog - lovers			2
‘ she ’s very special , but she ’s not going to be around for ever , ’ said @entity13 , a caterer in @entity109			2
the dachshund is the first dog in @entity3 to be cloned , having been imported from @entity6 @entity26 ( centre ) leaves after his trial at the @entity51 @entity114 in @entity51 in december 2010 @entity13 can not bear to imagine a life without her canine friend			1
‘ when @entity11 dies , i ’ll have to move , because every time i go for a walk i ’ll think of her , and i honestly wo n’t be able to cope , ’ she said			0
‘ i just love her so much , i really do			0
’ millions will understand — but many would recoil from the concept of manufacturing a genetic copy			0
for one thing , there is the cost			2
@entity15 justifies the colossal price - tag by pointing to the multi-millions spent on developing the technology			0
experts emphasise the fact that cloning can not revive a dead pet			2
the new animal might look identical , but it will have different experiences , perhaps even a different personality			0
the @entity135 said it was ‘ genuinely shocked ’ by @entity24 ’s contest , and added that there is little guarantee ‘ mini @entity11 ’ will resemble her namesake in anything but looks			0
original dachshund @entity11 , who was cloned , was originally a present for @entity13 , who suffered from bulimia professor @entity145 , an expert in genetics at the @entity147 in @entity109 , said : ‘ i see no valid justification for cloning pets			1
‘ it is a ridiculous waste of money and hope as well as being ethically very dubious			0
’ the technology that makes cloning possible first hit the headlines almost 20 years ago			0
dolly the sheep was created by scientists at @entity156 in 1996 , but was plagued by health problems and put down at the relatively young age of six			0
the biologist who cloned @entity160 , sir @entity161 , said he did not believe cloned animals automatically inherited the character of the original — the essence that had made them so loved in the first place — and warned that owners could be disappointed			0
@entity13 chose to clone her dog because of the irreplaceable bond she had to the original hound who saw her through so much of her life the only thing that ms @entity13 is unsure about is the temperament and personality of her dog - clone , and she 'll have to wait for her pup to grow up to be able to tell one of the @entity3 creators of @entity160 the sheep ( pictured ) , who became the world 's first cloned mammal in 1996 , has said he was sceptical of the benefits of cloning dogs			1

@entity13 won a @entity6 contest to clone her dog
the firm behind cloning is headed by @entity26
dr @entity26 falsely claimed he produced first cloned human embryo
he is on a suspended prison sentence for charges relating to faked research
the technique would usually cost £ 60,000
