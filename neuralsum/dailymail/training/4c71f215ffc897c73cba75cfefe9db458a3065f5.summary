by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has no excuses and must deliver trophies to @entity5 this season			1
that ’s the verdict of former @entity9 manager @entity8 , who insists @entity2 has received the backing of the club ’s board by being able to sign @entity13 and @entity14 this summer			1
‘ @entity2 is not used to being without trophies , ’ said the @entity15 , who left @entity16 in 1998 and is now a pundit for @entity18			1
‘ he wants to win something and this year it has to happen			2
with the squad they have , they need to win something			0
he did n’t have the striker he wanted and now he has it			0
now it ’s time to produce			0
‘ he wanted a player who could do what @entity41 did for him			0
he was looking for a player with the same style : powerful and strong , with good technique , someone who can hustle the opposition			0
‘ @entity13 is that player			0
can he do it in the @entity49 ? we are going to see			1
@entity14 hustles and works very hard			0
he makes sure to keep the opposition busy and can score goals			0
’ time to deliver : @entity2 failed to win a trophy in his first season back at @entity9 last year @entity9 need games - @entity2 @entity41 himself may miss the start of the season after twisting an ankle in sunday ’s friendly against @entity29			1
a scan yesterday showed no serious damage to ligaments but @entity2 is unlikely to risk the 36 - year - old at @entity64 on monday if there is any doubt about his readiness			1
the injury is a reminder that @entity9 ’s squad remains light on strikers			1
@entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 have all been sold , leaving three senior strikers at the club : @entity13 , @entity77 and @entity41			2
@entity2 spent most of last season lamenting the absence of a goalscoring centre forward			1
@entity80 were propelled to second place by 31 league goals from @entity83 and 21 from @entity84			0
@entity85 hit 17 in an injury - hit season for champions @entity87 and his replacement @entity90 scored 16			2
the glory years : @entity2 guided @entity9 to two @entity49 titles in his first spell at the club when asked near the end of last season why he thought @entity87 had proved so strong , @entity2 cited the quality of @entity90 , their ‘ third striker ’			1
@entity99 was the only @entity9 player in double figures in the last @entity49 season , with 14 , ahead of @entity72 with nine			1
@entity13 scored 27 times in @entity103 as @entity33 won the title and he will be expected to transfer that lethal strike rate to @entity106			2
no time for excuses : @entity8 believes @entity2 must deliver a trophy this season ‘ @entity9 are stronger and it is a team that could do really well , ’ added gullit			1
‘ it would be a surprise if they did not do well and with the players they have you can play attractive football			0
the thing is @entity87 have improved , @entity111 want to do well and @entity80 have bought a lot of players			0
all the other teams have improved			0
’ @entity18 will show more of the games that matter from the @entity49 , plus @entity122 , @entity124 qualifiers , @entity103 and @entity125 on @entity18 5 , your new home of @entity124 football .			2
