it sounds like the stuff of nightmares - but @entity3 will certainly be checking for ' monsters ' underneath his bed , after waking up to find an eight foot crocodile hiding just inches from where he slept			2
the 330lbs giant had sneaked into the @entity11 lodge , @entity12 and spent the entire night lying quietly , just fractions beneath an oblivious mr @entity3			1
the beast - a @entity16 crocodile - had managed to stay hidden for more than eight hours overnight			1
it sounds like the stuff of nightmares - but @entity3 will certainly be checking for ' monsters ' underneath his bed , after waking up to find an eight foot crocodile hiding just inches from where he slept astonishingly the giant beast managed to stay hidden for more than eight hours mr @entity3 ( pictured ) even perched on the edge of his bed organising his day - unaware of the fact that a 330lbs creature lay just fractions away from his dangling feet the following morning mr @entity3 - a former @entity12 cricketer - had even perched on the edge of his bed , with his feet dangling over the edge , just inches from the crocodile 's face , as he organised his day			1
but the 40 - year - old remained oblivious to his uninvited guest and was only alerted when he was enjoying some breakfast in the kitchen and heard the petrified screams of a housemaid			2
mr @entity3 , who is a director at @entity11 , ran back to his room and was horrified to discover the enormous crocodile nestled under his bed			1
he said : ' the really disconcerting thing about the whole episode is the fact that i was sitting on the edge of the bed that morning , bare foot and just centimetres away from the croc			2
' crocodiles are experts at hiding , that 's why they have survived on @entity51 for so long and why they are the ultimate killers in water			0
but the 40 - year - old remained oblivious to his uninvited guest and was only alerted when he was enjoying some breakfast in the kitchen and heard the petrified screams of a housemaid staff from the centre managed to get a rope around its head , and then dragged it out by its tail as it fought furiously mr @entity3 said he resisted being roped and hauled out from under the bed ' they know how to keep quiet and go unnoticed , it 's in their nature			1
' the crocodile came from the @entity71 which is a couple of kilometres from the house			2
' they often wander about the bush especially when it 's cold and raining			0
i think he liked it under the bed because it was warm			0
' he was forced to call in some of his co-workers who helped remove the crocodile from its new lair and release him back into @entity91 's @entity90 dam			1
mr @entity3 said : ' of course he resisted being roped and hauled out from under the bed , that 's only natural			0
' catching and securing a croc of any size on land though is a fairly straight forward affair and we are experienced in that			0
when roped the large creatures thrash around frantically and are extremely powerful mr @entity3 called in his co-workers who helped remove the crocodile from its new lair and release him back into @entity91 's @entity90 dam after dragging the croc outside , they were able to safely restrain it by tying up its mouth to avoid any bites but soon the creature was released back into his natural habitat , where he happily swam away ' the only real danger is getting bitten because it ca n't drown you			1
' the most important thing is to get its snout roped and secured and then it 's just a matter of restraining it and covering its eyes , to calm it down			0
' bigger crocs require more manpower obviously though			0
when roped they thrash around frantically and are extremely powerful			0
' i just remember thinking " goodness gracious , that 's one for the books "			0
' i 'm pretty sure everyone in @entity11 checks under their bed before going to sleep now anyway			1
