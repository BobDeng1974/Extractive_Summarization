‘ @entity99 ’s top six institutions ( and seven of all 11 @entity99 universities in the ranking ) are all in the @entity66 ‘ golden triangle ’ , and these institutions will continue to draw in the leading talent from @entity99 and beyond , supply the most desirable graduates into the local workforce and attract the lion ’s share of business investment			2
