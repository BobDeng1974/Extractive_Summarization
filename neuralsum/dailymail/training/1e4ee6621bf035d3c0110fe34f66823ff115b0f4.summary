a @entity1 chat show where women silently undress as the male host and a guest critique their bodies has been branded humiliating and sexist by viewers			1
the women walk on in a bath robe and then stand in front of the two men who are seated on an empty set with one harsh light			2
each model then removes her robe as host @entity15 , who also created the concept , and his guest appraise their figures			0
' @entity15 , who is a @entity1 x-factor judge , today defended his idea insisting he was actually doing women a favour as the ' female body thirsts for the words of a man '			1
he also said his show - which has the eponymous title @entity15 - was the work of a genius and had a higher objective of ' discussing the aesthetics of a female body without allowing the conversation to become pornographic or politically correct '			1
he said : ' i told them the entire idea of the show is to let men talk about the bodies of naked women while the woman is standing right in front of them			2
' the female body thirsts for words			1
the words of a man			0
and they went for it			0

' @entity15 claims it is the work of a genius and argues it has a higher objective of ' discussing the aesthetics of a female body ' ' artistic debate ' @entity15 ( right ) and his guest look like giggling schoolboys as they critique a woman 's body in the vile show critics rubbished his claims highlighting an example on one show in which he said : ' i 've always been an a * * man			1
even before @entity15 aired , it received massive media attention and has been widely criticised as being both sexist and humiliating for women			1
author @entity90 said : ' the programs so - called intention of breaking down taboos or challenging stereotypes is rubbish			0
' it 's more like a claustrophobic strip club which only serves to cement classic concepts of male dominance			0
' basically , things like this should have been able consigned to the scrap heap of history years ago			0
' one of the country 's top bloggers and opinion - makers , @entity107 , was also scathing , describing the show as ' an unsuccessful attempt to intellectualize the @entity110 – the only difference being that the young fillies on view in @entity114 have been replaced by naked women			2
' @entity107 has started a campaign demanding @entity117 cancel the show ' before this goes any further '			0
@entity119 of the @entity120 said @entity15 ’s show ' institutionalizes already run - of - the - mill malechauvinistic thinking			2

' remember , i am giving you something that you have never seen before			0
do n't bite the hand that feeds you			0

creator @entity15 claims that the female body ' thirsts for the words of a man '
critics brand vile show , which uses *derogatory* comments about the female figure , as sexist and humiliating
creator says this will open a debate about men 's views of women 's bodies without having to be ' politically correct '
@entity1 @entity174 judge retreats to @entity125 home saying his country is ' *ungrateful* ' and will ' wear down geniuses '
