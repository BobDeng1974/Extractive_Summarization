@entity2 had no intention of competing at the season - opening @entity5 @entity4 and will pay a price for their failure to race , @entity1 's ringmaster @entity0 indicated on monday			1
the struggling @entity11 - based team , who emerged from the remains of the failed @entity15 outfit after going into administration and missing the last three races of 2014 , failed to turn a wheel on the track in @entity20			1
they missed all three practice sessions and saturday qualifying , blaming software problems , which ruled them out of the race			1
manor mechanics work on their car in @entity20 , but they failed to take part at any point over the weekend @entity11 driver @entity31 has been named one of @entity2 's drivers this term , and @entity35 ( right ) however , they escaped punishment with stewards deciding to take no action after an enquiry decided the team had made ' all reasonable endeavours ' to get their cars ready			1
' we should have never ever , ever allowed @entity2 to do what they 've done			1
i predicted this would happen , ' @entity0 said			2
' they had no intention of racing in @entity5			2
they could n't have raced if someone had gone there with a machine gun and put it to their head			0
so they had no intention			0
we 'll have to see now			0
and they will have to pay their way to get there and get out of there , ' he added			2
@entity0 has indicated that @entity2 will pay the price for their no - show at the season opener @entity15 , who were ninth overall last season thanks to a ninth - place finish by @entity73 @entity72 in @entity74 , won a race against time to get their cars through crash tests and onto the air charter for @entity5			1
@entity0 said there had been no charge for the freight because they were entitled to that providing they were competing			2
' they are not competing so they have to pay for that , ' he added			0
the team are in line for some £ 28million of revenues from last season but would have forfeited the right to that if they had not turned up to compete in @entity5 with cars that satisfied the regulations			1
' we knew we had the possibility of unknown problems and we have n't had the benefit of sorting some of those problems out in pre-season testing , ' sporting director @entity35 said			0
' but equally we had to come here on the basis that we 're racing so we brought all of our normal equipment			0
there 's 28 tonnes of equipment to support these cars and all of the staff			0
' we are trying very hard but it is a tough thing to do in the time available			0
' @entity113 cruises to victory in @entity5 gp			1

@entity2 failed to take part in practice , qualifying or the race in @entity20
the @entity11 - based team escaped *sanction* from the @entity5 gp stewards
team would have forfeited £ 28m of revenues after finishing ninth in last year 's *constructors* ' championship if they did not attend opening race
but @entity1 *supremo* @entity0 indicated that they must now pay
