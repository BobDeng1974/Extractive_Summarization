the landing site for @entity3 's @entity2 probe that will try to land on comet @entity4 next week now has an official name			1
previously known only as ' @entity7 ' , the area is now called @entity8 and will be the location of the first - ever attempt to land on a comet on 12 november			1
if successful , @entity2 will study the surface of the comet with a variety of instruments until march 2015 at the latest			1
@entity15 , headquartered in @entity16 , has named its comet landing site			1
called ' @entity8 ' - previously just ' @entity7 ' - it will be the target of the @entity19 next week ( illustration of landing shown )			1
the name was picked for its relation to the @entity25 origins of the probe the name was selected by a jury comprising members of the @entity30 as part of a public competition run from 16 to 22 october by @entity15 and the @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 space agencies			1
@entity8 was one of the most popular entries , proposed by over 150 participants			2
the committee selected @entity41 from @entity35 as the overwall winner , although more than 150 others had also suggested the name			0
the landing site , previously known as ' @entity7 ' , is named for @entity46 , an island on the @entity47 in the south of @entity49			1
a complex of @entity25 buildings , including the famous @entity2 , was moved to @entity8 from the island of @entity2 when the latter was flooded during the building of the @entity55 last century			1
its relation to @entity2 , the name of the lander , was one of the reasons it was such a popular choice for entrants and ultimately chosen			1
the name echoes the @entity25 origins of @entity3 and @entity2 , named in recognition of milestones in decoding hieroglyphics , the sacred writing system of ancient @entity49			1
as a prize , mr @entity41 will be invited to @entity15 's @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity34 , to follow the landing live			1
' the decision was very tough , ' @entity75 of the @entity76 , chair of the @entity30			0
' we received so many good suggestions on how to name @entity79 , and we were delighted with such an enthusiastic response from all over the world			0
we wish to thank all participants for sharing their great ideas with us			0
' dr @entity84 , @entity85 manager , added : ' it could n't be a more appropriate name			0
' the relocation of the temples of @entity2 to @entity46 was an ambitious technical endeavour performed in the 1960s and 1970s to preserve an archaeological record of our ancient history			2
' on 12 november , we 'll be attempting a unique comet landing , an even more ambitious endeavour to unlock secrets of our most remote origins			1
' below is a short science fiction film made for the @entity3 mission starring @entity102 from @entity103 @entity2 will attempt to land on the surface of @entity105 ( illustration shown ) on 12 november			1
if successful it will study the surface until march 2015 at the latest			1
@entity3 's mission will continue much longer			0
images of the comet recently revealed dunes and boulders on its surface as the @entity3 space probe prepares for its historic attempt to deploy a lander on comet @entity4 , @entity115 revealed the technology it has pioneered to make the £ 1 billion ( $ 1.6 billion ) programme possible			1
at its @entity123 in @entity124 , @entity125 , a team of engineers developed a ' smartphone - like system ' that enables @entity15 to communicate with and control the movements of the probe , which is currently more than 310 million miles ( 500 million kilometres ) away			1
in addition , @entity115 ' technology makes sure all the imagery of the comet and scientific data @entity3 is capturing to be received back on @entity135			2
the recent decision that the mission is ' go ' for @entity79 confirms the timeline of events leading up to the landing of @entity2 on @entity3			1
@entity3 will release @entity2 at 08:35 gmt / 09:35 cet on 12 november at a distance of approximately 14 miles ( 22.5km ) from the centre of the comet			1
the landing will be about seven hours later at around 15:30 gmt / 16:30 cet			0
during the seven - hour descent , @entity2 will take images and conduct science experiments , sampling the dust , gas and plasma environment close to the comet			1
it will take a ' farewell ' image of the @entity3 orbiter shortly after separation , along with a number of images as it approaches the comet surface			1
it is expected that the first images from this sequence will be received on @entity135 several hours after separation			0
once safely on the surface , @entity2 will take a panorama of its surroundings			1
again , this is expected back on @entity135 several hours later			0
the first sequence of surface science experiments will begin about an hour after touchdown and will last for 64 hours , constrained by the lander 's primary battery lifetime			0
longer - term study of the comet by @entity2 will depend on for how long and how well the batteries are able to recharge , which in turn is related to the amount of dust that settles on its solar panels			1
in any case , it is expected that by march 2015 , as the comet moves closer in its orbit towards the @entity185 , temperatures inside the lander will have reached levels too high to continue operations , and @entity2 's science mission will come to an end			1
the @entity3 orbiter 's mission will continue for much longer			0
it will accompany the comet as it grows in activity until their closest approach to the @entity185 in august 2015 and then as they head back towards the outer @entity198			2
the system , known as the @entity200 ( @entity200 ) , is capable of measuring @entity3 's speed to within fractions of a millimetre per second			0
it can also measure its distance to within 3.3ft ( one metre ) anywhere in the solar system , factors which are critical to the success of the mission			0
when used at two ground stations , it uses triangulation to determine the direction with an accuracy of a millionth of a degree - equivalent to the apparent diameter of a coin 620 miles ( 1,000km ) away			0
@entity219 , @entity115 ' lead engineer for the project , said : ' @entity221 , orbiting , and landing on a comet requires delicate and supremely accurate manoeuvres			2
' the target comet is a relatively small object about 4 kilometres [ 2.5 miles ] in diameter , moving at incredible speeds through the solar system			2
' to help make any of this possible , what we have done , in layman 's terms , is create a ' smartphone ' for inter-planetary communication that gives @entity15 the capability to communicate with and control the @entity3 probe throughout its 10 year mission as it travels more than five times @entity135 's distance from the @entity185 ' the interplanetary ' smartphone ' guiding the @entity3 is pictured here			2
as @entity3 prepares for its historic attempt to deploy a lander on comet , @entity115 revealed the technology it has pioneered which makes the programme possible , known as the @entity200 ( @entity200 ) @entity15 released this mosaic of @entity3 's comet last week			1
it reveals fascinating details on the surface including boulders			2
dunes of dust can also be seen drifting across last week , the @entity200 was used to transmit new images of the comet back to @entity135 , revealing its surface in unprecedented detail			1
in the pictures , an incredible amount of detail can be spotted - including boulders on the surface and dust moving across plains			2
@entity115 has revealed the technology it has pioneered to make the £ 1 billion ( $ 1.6 billion ) @entity3 programme possible			0
at its @entity123 in @entity124 , @entity125 , a team of engineers developed a ' smartphone - like system ' that enables @entity15 to communicate with and control the movements of the probe , which is currently more than 310 million miles ( 500 million kilometres ) away			2

the latest images of comet @entity4 were taken from a distance of six miles ( 9.8km ) from the comet 's centre and revealed in a blog post by @entity15			1
four new images were released and combined into one mosaic image			0
in those images the scale is about 26 inches ( 66 cm ) per pixel			0
the mosaic covers about 3,940 to 4,430ft ( 1,200 to 1,350 metres ) on the comet 's surface			2
towards the upper left of the image is an area of bright material that was cast in shadow in previous images , possibly at the base of a cliff			0
a recent landslide of sorts may have uncovered this material			0
@entity15 adds , though , that the brightness of the images is a little bit misleading , as the comet is actually blacker than coal			1
in order to make features , visible the images are grey - scaled and also set to a high contrast to make them appear brighter			0
' also not seen previously in this much detail are the two boulders just below the centre of the mosaic , one of which takes on a heart - shaped appearance from this angle , ' space science editor @entity327 wrote for @entity15 on their blog			2
' zooming in reveals hints of a layered structure and both objects seems to be appearing from beneath the dusty layer , just like some of the smaller ' boulders ' around them			0
' within the images can also be seen a mysterious pyramid - shaped rock that was previously spotted by @entity15			2
it can be seen just above the middle in the mosaic			0
at around 82ft - tall ( 25 metres ) , the structure is one of the larger boulders seen on the comet and could help scientists better understand its history			2
@entity356 , taken by @entity3 's @entity358 camera on 19 september , from a distance of 17.7 miles ( 28.5km ) in this image released on 18 october , meanwhile , dunes can be seen drifting down the centre @entity3 took an incredible selfie of its 131ft ( 40 metre ) solar wings gleaming against the darkness of space last month			0
in the background is the duck - shaped comet , @entity371 , with its distinct ' head ' and ' body ' clearly visible			0

@entity15 , headquartered in @entity16 , has named its comet landing site
called ' @entity8 ' it will be the target of the @entity19 next week
the name was picked for its relation to the @entity25 origins of the probe
@entity2 will attempt to land on the surface of @entity105 on 12 november
if successful , it will study the surface until march 2015 at the latest
