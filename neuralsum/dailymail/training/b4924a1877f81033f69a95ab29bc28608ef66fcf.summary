the next six months could prove the best time in history to take out a mortgage , experts claimed yesterday			0
they said a price war between lenders will make it the perfect opportunity for homebuyers or anyone remortgaging			0
fixed - rate deals have never been cheaper and may even slip below 1 per cent within weeks			1
variable rates have almost halved over the past 12 months to 1.64 per cent			2
@entity11 , of the @entity12 , said : ‘ the next six months are shaping up to be the best - ever window to secure a low interest rate if you are looking to buy or remortgage			2
@entity17 buyers can secure fixed rate mortgages of just 1.19 per cent according to new research , file photo ‘ today ’s prices have never been bettered in modern times and given that a base rate rise is inevitable at some point , it is unlikely they will be surpassed in the years ahead			1
‘ lenders have begun the year with a strong appetite for growth , and newcomers are going head to head with established names to launch attractive new deals			0
’ @entity36 data shows that a typical two - year fix has dropped from 2.37 per cent to 2.01 per cent over the past 12 months			1
on a £ 200,000 loan with 25 per cent deposit , that would save £ 420 a year			1
a five - year fix has fallen from 3.34 per cent to 3.09 per cent , saving £ 300 a year			1
and the average variable rate has plunged from 2.74 per cent to 1.64 per cent – chopping £ 1,300 off annual repayments			2
lenders have dropped their rates after economists tipped the bank to keep its base rate at an historic low of 0.5 per cent until next year			2
the arrival of new challenger banks entering the mortgage market has also increased competition , driving down rates further			2
experts said two - year fixed rates could fall below 1 per cent while five - year mortgages could go below 2 per cent			1
shrewd investors can secure a ten - year fixed rate mortgage for just 2.89 per cent according to new figures mortgage broker @entity60 , of @entity62 , said : ‘ we are now seeing rates fall to a level that once seemed unthinkable			1
‘ mortgage lenders are in the midst of a rate war which shows no sign of abating soon , as they battle it out for business			2
‘ with new lenders coming into the market and competition intensifying we could even see these offerings fall a touch lower			0
‘ the next few months could well prove to be the best time to lock into low rates which may not be seen again for a generation			0
’ he warned however that the low rates on offer sometimes came with high one - off fees			2
experts have said that two - year fixed deals could drop below 1 per cent as established lenders compete with newcomers to win business and , while mortgages are cheap , steep property prices mean home ownership is still out of reach for many			1
prices across the @entity92 rose by 10 per cent in the last year and 15 per cent in @entity93 , with the average home now £ 271,000 or £ 501,000 in the capital , according to the @entity96			0
@entity97 of the charity shelter said : ‘ despite talk of mortgages being at an historic low , it certainly does n’t feel like that for many young people and families for whom buying their own home remains a distant dream			0
‘ sky high house prices mean families working hard and saving what they can ca n’t even come close to affording a home of their own			0
the only way to tackle our housing crisis is for politicians to build the affordable houses we urgently need			0
’ mortgage rates are also at record lows for homeowners with lower deposits such as 5 and 10 per cent			1
but while many banks have slashed interest rates potential buyers must still pass strict affordability tests which were introduced by the @entity126 last april			2
the @entity127 forces lenders to ask applicants in - depth questions about their income and spending habits to ensure they can still afford their repayments if interest rates rise significantly			2
last june , the @entity36 also recommended that no more than 15 per cent of new lending was for high - risk loans worth more than 4.5 times buyers ’ income			1
both of these restrictions initially slowed down the mortgage market as lenders were reluctant to lend for fear of breaking the rules			0
however , lending has since bounced back after banks and building societies adapted to the changes			0
lenders are now making up for lost time and competing aggressively for customers , including those with low deposits , providing they can comfortably afford such a large debt			0
happy days : rumours that the @entity36 could hold base interest rates at their current record low of 0.5 per cent for another year has sparked a lending war ( pictured , bank governor @entity159 ) the low - deposit market has been fuelled by the government ’s help to buy scheme , where the state helps buyers with small deposits on to the property ladder			1
one of the reasons banks are able to offer mortgages at such low rates at the moment is because they have a glut of cash to loan out from the funding for lending scheme			0
launched in 2012 , the initiative allowed banks and building societies to borrow cheaply from the bank on condition they then used some of the money to offer mortgages to home buyers			0
rigorous stress testing must still be carried out on customers , however , before loans are agreed			0
where are the cheapest fixed rate mortgages ? the best rate on an online easy access savings account is currently 1.5 per cent from @entity195 in branch			1
you could also put money away tax - free in a cash @entity200 and @entity201 has the best easy access @entity200 at 1.5 per cent			1
there are 25 mortgages priced below these savings rates - not all are fixed rates , some are tracker or variable rates and the cost of these would move up if interest rate rise			1
@entity212 has a record low two - year fixed rate at 1.19 per cent with a £ 1,499 fee , but you will also need a big 40 per cent deposit			1
a 25 - year £ 150,000 mortgage would cost £ 578 a month and £ 15,378 over two years , including the fee			1
but you must watch out for the fees attached to the best mortgages as these have risen , so it is still important to shop around			0
for example , the high fee actually makes this mortgage more expensive			0
in comparison , @entity226 has a higher rate at 1.29 per cent with a £ 975 fee			0
that 25 - year £ 150,000 mortgage with @entity226 would cost slightly more at £ 585 a month , but thanks to its lower fee come in £ 358 cheaper than @entity212 at £ 15,020 over two years			1
