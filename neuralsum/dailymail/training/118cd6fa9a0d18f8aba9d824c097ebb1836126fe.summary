marijuana has been legalized in @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 as a series of sidelined pro-cannabis referendums were ushered in during the midterm elections			1
the legalization has provided a new high for the marijuana lobby , two years after @entity10 and @entity1 led the way in approving cannabis for recreational use			1
on marijuana , @entity1 approved the measure by 65 percent in favor and 28 percent against , while @entity2 passed by 54 percent to 46 percent			1
in @entity3 , the vote was passed with a 52 percent majority			2
' on the streets of the @entity38 capital , pro-marijuana campaigners were in jubilant form			2
the result in @entity1 became not just a practical victory for its campaigners , but also a symbolic one			2
@entity43 , a leading pro-cannabis campaigner , said : ' this is a great day for ending the war on drugs in the @entity1			2
' he told the @entity48 : ' this is huge			0
we ’re talking about ending the prohibition of marijuana as a manifestation of the war on drugs , in the birthplace of the war on drugs : @entity1 ' @entity1 of @entity58 was the birth place of the war on drugs , and marijuana prohibition was the engine of the war on drugs			1
today we are putting the engine out of commission			0
' however , @entity66 appeared to have failed to approve a measure allowing marijuana for medical purposes			1
some 57 percent voted in favor , less than the 60 percent required for the proposal to pass , partial results showed			0
following @entity10 and @entity1 's lead two years ago , the shift in policy could inspire other states to take similar action during the next election , and eventually , lead to loosened marijuana laws across the country			1
and while marijuana is nowhere to be found on the ballot in @entity22 , a medical marijuana dispensary in @entity21 , @entity23 , was offering a free gram of weed to members of the public who vote on tuesday			1
trail - blazer : @entity90 attorney @entity89 ( above ) , who helped write the initiative that became @entity2 measure 91 , wore a @entity94 hat to support his work on tuesday too good to be true : the @entity97 message announcing free weed at @entity23 ( above ) speaking with @entity100 , manager @entity99 said , ' if people go out and they vote and they bring in their " i voted " sticker , we 're going to give them a complimentary gram on the house			1
' at least a dozen people had taken the dispensary up on their offer by midday			0
opponents worry that the government wo n't truly be able to regulate the marijuana industry to make sure sellers are distributing safe to use product			0
they 're also concerned that it will lead to greater numbers of car accidents as high drivers take to the roads			0
the @entity90 @entity120 , a local paper , has pointed to @entity1 and @entity10 as evidence that the argument is bogus			1
neither states have seen an increased in roadway accidents since legalizing pot two years ago , it said			0
the @entity127 and the state 's most influential newspaper , @entity130 , have both come out in favor of marijuana legalization in the state			2
@entity3 's vote will change the law to allow people over the age of 21 to maintain six pot plants and poses a single ounce of dope			1
according to language contained in the measure , the @entity141 would implement the bill , but the state legislature would be required to develop a @entity146 to take over regulation of pot sales permanently			1
activist @entity149 from the @entity150 holds a sign during the midterm elections in @entity1 encouraging voters to legalize recreational weed and low - level pot production @entity1 residents are voting on whether or not to legalize recreational weed and low - level pot production a key argument against decriminalization in @entity3 is that it would reportedly cost the state government $ 7 million per year to regulate			1
meanwhile , residents in @entity1 will be allowed to possess six pot plants and two ounces of weed			1
the @entity1 ballot initiative would not provide any other regulatory guideline for recreational pot use however , such as government oversight and taxes			1
however , @entity167 , which has superseding authority over the @entity1 , may strike it down			2
likewise , even though ballot measures in @entity2 and @entity3 have received voters ' approval , federal law still categorizes the possession , sale and distribution of dope a crime			1
the @entity180 , the main group pushing for the @entity2 ballot initiative , is working world wide to get pot - friendly laws passed			1
already , they are working to get pro-pot bills on the ballot in several states ahead of the 2016 elections , which reportedly include @entity22 , @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190			2
' if we lose in @entity2 , it will shift the national frame a little bit , ' @entity195 , executive director of the group , had previously told @entity197			0
' but it does n’t change the strategy and it does n’t change the tactics , ' he said			0
' a generation from now people will still step back and look at the prohibition of marijuana and say , what the heck was that about ? ' @entity2 voters decided for the third time today whether to legalize the recreational use of marijuana and the businesses that support it likewise , @entity211 , communications director of the @entity1 based @entity212 , another leader in the legalization movement and a major funder of the @entity3 initiative , said today 's outcome would have little effect on the future of decriminalization			1
@entity211 's group alone put $ 700,000 into the @entity3 measure			1
it would like to see restrictions on weed that are similar to those on alcohol			0
state and local ballot initiatives , such as those which have introduced the pro-marijuana legislation , are often overlooked in the frenzy for the @entity232			0
the @entity234 state in 2012 became the first state , along with @entity1 , to give the thumbs up to recreational marijuana use after a pro-pot ballot initiative was approved by voters			1
this year @entity240 are being asked to consider a measure that would give unborn babies the same legal rights as babies out of the womb			0
the initiative would amend the @entity10 constitution to redefine person and child in the state 's wrongful death act to ' include unborn human beings			1
' the suggested law change is in response to the death of an unborn baby named ' @entity257 ' who was killed by a drunk driver in his mother 's eight month of pregnancy			0
current @entity10 law does considers an unborn child part of its mother 's body , and so the driver was not charged with homicide			0
opponents of the law , which include @entity268 , say the language change could lead to the criminalization of abortion			0
in the end , a resounding majority of the voters declined			0
proponents of @entity276 on tuesday			0

in @entity296 pro-abortion voters also won by 64 percent to 36 percent			0

several towns and cities voted on measures against genetically modified organisms ( @entity282 )			0
referendums in @entity2 and @entity10 sought to make it mandatory to label food containing gmos			1
