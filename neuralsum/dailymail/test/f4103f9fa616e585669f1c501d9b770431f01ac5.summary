@entity0 thumped @entity1 4 - 2 at @entity2 on sunday to move four points clear of their cross-town rivals			1
@entity6 's men continued their excellent run of form and a @entity10 spot looks all but assured now for them after their @entity12 derby victory			0
@entity1 , meanwhile , have gone from joint top on @entity14 to 12 points off the leaders and looking over their shoulders at the likes of @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
here are five things we learned from the @entity12 derby			0
united now on course for @entity10 for much of the season @entity0 seemed to be in false position , with their performances hardly giving the impression they belonged in the top four			2
but now - whether by luck or design - something seems to have clicked for @entity6 and @entity0 are now playing with a cutting edge and with confidence			2
a @entity10 return now looks likely			0
@entity0 celebrated a 4 - 2 win over their closest rivals at @entity2 on sunday crisis for city and pellegrini @entity1 's results since going joint top of the @entity42 on @entity14 make abysmal reading for a side of their quality			1
their run of four league wins in 12 games - during a period in which they also went out of two cup competitions - surely constitutes a crisis for a club with their expectations			2
the already considerable scrutiny on manager @entity57 will increase another notch			0
@entity57 is under increasing pressure after a woeful second half of the season for his team @entity63 continues to hit back for much of his first season at @entity0 , @entity63 looked out of touch and possibly out of his depth			1
that has all changed in the last few months as he has become increasingly important to @entity68			0
the midfielder uses his strength to great effect as @entity0 continue to loft the ball forward to him and teams find him difficult to dispossess			0
@entity63 celebrates after heading @entity0 into the lead in the first half @entity63 has been key in @entity0 's recent run of form to lift them into third place in the @entity42 @entity38 team coming to end of line there can be little doubt that the @entity1 team , the core of which has won two @entity42 titles , an @entity85 and a @entity86 , is coming to the end of its lifespan			1
reinvestment is clearly needed in the summer and , on this evidence , the back four would be a priority			0
@entity93 looks on dejected during @entity1 's thrashing at @entity2 on sunday @entity0 need to improve defensively too for all that @entity0 went on to dominate the game , @entity1 started superbly , reminding everyone of the quality they do still possess			1
they troubled @entity0 repeatedly at the back , where the central defensive partnership of @entity101 and @entity102 again looked vulnerable			0
former @entity0 manager sir @entity103 watches the game from the stands at @entity2 @entity103 was all smiles after @entity0 's victory , as was singer @entity108 ( left )			1

@entity0 beat @entity1 4 - 2 at @entity2
@entity111 moved @entity0 four points clear of their cross-town rivals
@entity1 went from joint top on @entity14 to 12 points behind @entity117
@entity63 continues his *rebirth* in the last few weeks
