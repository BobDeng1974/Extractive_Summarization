middle class students face losing out on places at top universities as growing numbers of them adopt a scheme which prioritises disadvantaged pupils for places			1
top universities are signing up to a scheme that means disadvantaged teenagers do n’t need to obtain the same grades as their better - off rivals to get a place			1
twelve universities including @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 are already involved in the @entity18 programme which involved them giving ‘ alternative offers ’ to disadvantaged students			1
top universities are signing up to a scheme that means disadvantaged teenagers do n't need to obtain the same grades as their better - off rivals to get a place and it has now been revealed that three more universities have entered the scheme - @entity27 , @entity29 ; @entity30 and @entity31			1
the universities say the scheme promotes ‘ fairer access ’ and will increase the number of pupils from working - class families and poorly performing state schools going to university			1
but critics say it is unfair to discriminate against hard - working pupils from middle class backgrounds , and say the scheme does nothing to solve the root cause of educational disadvantage			1
dr @entity48 , former chairman of the @entity50 ’ and @entity51 ’ @entity53 ( @entity53 ) and ex high master of prestigious @entity54 , @entity55 , said asking universities to address inequality in this way was letting schools ‘ off the hook ’ and was like ‘ applying a bandage to lung cancer			2
’ dr @entity48 , who is now director of education for @entity64 , said : ‘ this is n’t an answer to a problem , it an evasion of a problem			0
‘ i think it ’s because our school system has failed to do the right thing by our children and we want an easy fix			0
dr @entity48 , former chairman of the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) said asking universities to address inequality in this way was letting schools ' off the hook ' ‘ our schools are not helping disadvantaged children to achieve respectable grades and these things do n’t do anything about that problem			2
in fact , if anything , they take the pressure off			0
‘ it ’s like saying that if enough people ca n’t afford to buy a @entity94 , you lower the price			0
‘ that ’s not the point really , is it ? it ’s acting on the point of supply , not the point of production			0
we have a supply line that ’s not working			2
’ the move comes amid mounting pressure from the @entity107 ( @entity107 ) on @entity109 ’s most selective universities to set ‘ challenging ’ targets to recruit pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds			1
a-level students who attend a school with below average exam results or high numbers of poor pupils are eligible to join @entity18			1
they must meet at least two criteria including live in a ‘ low participation ’ neighbourhood ; be eligible for discretionary payments , free school meals or come from a home where neither parent has attended university			0
the pupils must have also achieved at least eight a * to c grades at gcse including @entity109 and maths , with a minimum of five at @entity132 or @entity133 students who successfully complete the programme - which includes @entity137 , online study skills courses and entering an @entity142 - ‘ benefit from alternative offers or additional consideration ’ from partner universities , according to the group ’s website			1
it says : ‘ many partner universities will give an alternative offer worth up to two a level grades or equivalent			0
’ for example , where a middle class student might be told they need three a grades to get into a university , a student deemed as ‘ disadvantaged ’ would only need three b grades			1
at @entity157 , ‘ dual offers ’ are made to @entity18 students who have met subject - specific entry requirements			1
this is equivalent to 40 @entity163 tariff points and equates to an entry reduction of up to two a-levels grades , such as @entity166 instead of @entity167			0
@entity16 also offers up to two a-level grades lower than the standard offer following completion of the programme			0
@entity15 , which usually makes offers as high as a * aa in certain subjects , is prepared to go as low as @entity166 for some @entity175 students			0
more than 1,200 teenagers from ‘ educationally and socially disadvantaged backgrounds ’ have been supported through the national programme so far			0
universities minister @entity179 said : ‘ the expansion of @entity18 is good news , and will help even more young people from less advantaged backgrounds benefit from the transformational experience of higher education			1
’ professor @entity186 , head of @entity107 , has previously backed the use of differential offers for students from struggling state comprehensives - allowing them to win places with lower grade a-levels than those from high - flying schools			2
universities wishing to charge up to £ 9,000 a year must draw up an ‘ access agreement ’ - signed off by @entity198 - setting out how they will attract and support students from disadvantaged backgrounds			2
@entity107 has the ultimate power to fine universities £ 500,000 or ban them from charging tuition fees of more than £ 6,000 if they fail to widen access to under - represented groups			2
earlier this week , @entity208 , director of the @entity210 , claimed that @entity212 universities should be more explicit in attempts to ‘ socially engineer ’ admissions in favour of poor students .			0
