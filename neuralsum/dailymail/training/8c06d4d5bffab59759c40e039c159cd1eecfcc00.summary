the optimism of @entity1 who opted for @entity3 as their leader has all but evaporated for the more perceptive farmyard turkey , it has been a troubling week			1
the annual @entity9 advert has hit our tv screens ; @entity12 has a new set of lights ; and @entity16 pop groups are signing up for another revival of @entity18			0
but at least the turkeys can say they never voted for @entity20 – unlike the dozens of @entity1 who opted for @entity3 as their leader four years ago and now face a similarly bleak fate			1
back in the summer , most of those mps were quietly confident the party would win the election next may , but that optimism has evaporated			2
first , there ’s the @entity31 factor			0
for two years , @entity33 strategists have been saying : ‘ if @entity34 keep doing well up to 2015 , we ’ll win a majority			1
’ now the fear is that @entity34 will do too well next may , taking large numbers of votes off @entity1 , not just the @entity39			1
then there ’s the @entity42 problem , where the collapse in @entity33 ’s poll ratings has put a huge dent in the party ’s chances of forming a majority at @entity49			1
that dual threat from @entity34 and the @entity51 will also force @entity33 to spend money it does n’t have defending dozens of seats it thought it could take for granted			1
but what ’s worrying @entity1 above all is their leader			2
that @entity3 - shaped elephant has been in the room ever since he won the leadership , but his mps have so far contrived to ignore it			2
after all , the polls had been suggesting that even if people did n’t rate @entity3 personally , it would n’t stop them voting for @entity33			1
there was also a sense that once people got to see a bit more of him , his ratings would get better			0
i mean they could n’t get any worse , could they ? the past six weeks have shattered both illusions			0
since his calamitous party conference speech , @entity3 ’s popularity has plumbed new depths , even falling below @entity76 ’s			1
and in escalating numbers , even lifelong @entity33 voters – those who stuck with the party in 2010 – are now telling local activists that the ‘ @entity3 issue ’ will affect their decision next time round			1
on monday , one poll put @entity33 on 29 per cent – the same rock - bottom rating it achieved at that 2010 election ; a shock for @entity1 who thought things could never get that bad again			1
against that restless backdrop , @entity3 executed a mini-reshuffle , prompted by the departure of shadow international development secretary @entity93			2
personally , i would have appointed some hard - nosed hatchet carrier with a remit to plan the department ’s abolition and channel @entity16 ’s overseas aid through agencies such as @entity102 instead			0
instead , in a move that could charitably be described as defiant , or uncharitably as daft , @entity3 used the reshuffle to elevate three of his closest allies			0
thanks to the so - called @entity31 effect , the fear is that @entity34 will do too well next may , taking large numbers of votes off @entity1 , forcing the party to spend money defending seats it took for granted most notably , the adviser who managed his leadership bid , @entity117 , has been put in full charge of @entity3 ’s operation and @entity33 ’s campaigning , less than two years after becoming an mp			1
outside @entity49 , most people knew little and cared less about these appointments , but inside the party they mattered hugely – not so much pouring oil on @entity33 ’s troubled waters as introducing a shoal of piranhas			1
what they said to @entity1 was that @entity3 is not interested in listening to any of their concerns about his leadership			1
far from being willing to change , he is cocooning himself ever more tightly in a circle of like - minded acolytes			0
the appointment of @entity117 in this week 's reshuffle was not so much pouring oil on @entity33 ’s troubled waters as introducing a shoal of piranhas so this is the reality that @entity1 face – they have a leader who is more unpopular than @entity76 , but too arrogant either to admit it or do anything about it			1
and if he is not prepared to change , the question is , what are they prepared to do ? there is one group – the reluctant plotters – who know that openly challenging @entity3 may be their only hope , but constantly talk themselves out of it			0
they fear that divided parties always lose , that it ’s too close to the @entity154 , and that there ’s no obvious candidate to take over – not least because none of the current @entity158 will go near any discussion of plots			0
most of all , with memories still raw of attempted coups against @entity164 , they worry about ending up with that worst of all outcomes – a failed putsch , even though @entity3 has nothing approaching @entity164 ’s army of spies and bodyguards , not to mention his survival instincts			0
if there was a genuine assault on @entity177 , their defences would last as long as the @entity178			0
there is a second group – the professional optimists – who still hope @entity33 can muddle through and win under @entity3			2
finally , there is a third group – the stoical cynics – who believe the election is already lost and have no intention of challenging @entity3 because they want all the responsibility for the defeat hung round his neck			0
but the danger is that may ’s election may be the last chance that @entity1 ever get to be a party of government			2
by the 2020 election , @entity16 could be out of @entity198 , @entity42 could be independent and a right - wing coalition that pushes through boundary changes could be in a position of permanent dominance within an ‘ @entity203 ’			0
if @entity1 are fearful of that scenario , then may is their win - or - bust opportunity to avert it , and if they believe they can not win with @entity3 , then now is the time to do something about it			2
unlike the @entity20 turkeys , @entity1 do have control over their fate , but their time to use it is fast running out .			0

optimism of @entity33 mps who opted for @entity3 as their leader is *fading*
fears @entity34 will take large numbers of votes off @entity1 , not just @entity39
slip in @entity33 ratings in @entity42 will affect chance of @entity49 majority
dual threats will force @entity33 to spend money defending ' *comfortable* ' seats
now polls rating suggest @entity3 's popularity has *plunged* new depths
