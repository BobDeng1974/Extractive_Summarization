by @entity0 @entity1 has penned an emotional farewell to @entity4 fans as he leaves the club after nine years at @entity6			1
the @entity8 favourite is heading for @entity9 in a £ 2million deal after a year on loan at @entity12 having fallen behind @entity13 in @entity15 ' pecking order			1
and for the second year running he has poured out his heart to the @entity4 fans as he leaves @entity6 and @entity17 for the last time before his move to @entity19			1
' he says that he knew his time at the club was over before the last campaign and updates the fans from last year 's letter on what he calls ' an honour and a priviledge			2
' the move to @entity55 reunites @entity1 with his former captain at @entity57 , @entity58 , and he says he wants to enjoy his time with the @entity25 champions as much as his time at @entity4			1
finally , he tells fans that he now counts himself as a @entity62 and he looks forward to returning to @entity6 as a fan			1
loan spell : @entity1 spent a year with @entity65 's @entity12 after @entity4 made it clear he was n't no 1 anymore quality : @entity1 made one appearance for @entity69 in their dead rubber game at the @entity72 in the group stage around this time last year , i wrote a letter to say goodbye to @entity4 and the fans after i joined @entity12			1
some people asked why i was doing it when i was only going on loan for a season and would be back within twelve months but the reality was that it was already clear to me that my time at @entity6 was over			0
@entity4 had signed @entity13 to be their new number one and i was being allowed to go out on loan so i wanted to take the opportunity to offer my thanks and bid farewell because i knew that i would not be back			0
i suppose this is a bit of an update now that my departure has been confirmed and i want to take the opportunity to thank everyone at @entity4 – and i mean everyone – for everything that they have done for me over years			2
last time , some of my words were misinterpreted and taken out of the context in which they were meant but it would never be my intention to leave @entity4 on anything but good terms so hopefully this will put that right once and for all			0
i have been extremely fortunate to spend so many years at what i consider to be one of the greatest clubs in world football			0
it has been an honour and a privilege			0
the memories i have of @entity6 , my team mates , the supporters and the people of @entity4 will stay with me forever			1
i am disappointed that i am leaving but only in the sense that i enjoyed being at the club so much and it is always difficult to say goodbye to something that is special to you			0
i will always be grateful to have played for @entity4 and my time at the club was always going to come to an end so we move on with no hard feelings			2
all i can do now is look forward to a new adventure at @entity9 and being reunited with @entity58 , who was my first captain at @entity57			0
hopefully i will enjoy being with them as much as i enjoyed being with @entity4 and again , i am fortunate to be going from one great club to another			0
i will return to at @entity6 some time soon , though , only next time it will be as a fan rather than a player and i hope that when i do come back @entity4 will be challenging for the biggest trophies like they always should			1
the final thing for me to do is to express my gratitude to everyone who has supported me in any way since i joined @entity4 in 2005 – all of the managers who i have played under , all of the players who i shared a dressing room with , all of the staff who helped me in so many ways and every single one of the fans who gave the team and myself the kind of backing that others can only dream of			2
i count myself as a @entity62 and i will be one for life			0
