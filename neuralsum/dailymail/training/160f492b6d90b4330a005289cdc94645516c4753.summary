mp @entity0 is a fervent anti-obesity campaigner @entity2 mp @entity0 complained about being ‘ squashed ’ by a ‘ large - bottomed man ’ sitting next to her on the train yesterday			1
the former public health minister , who has campaigned against obesity , urged overweight commuters to slim down to ensure they can fit into the seats properly			1
mrs @entity0 managed to get a seat on the crowded 7.34am train to @entity13 yesterday			1
the @entity15 mp tweeted : ‘ seats free on 7.34 but in the middle seat of three			2
small - bottomed man to my left but a very large - bottomed man to my right , who is asleep with his arms crossed on his ample stomach , which makes that squashed feeling seem so much worse somehow			1
’ when she was a public health minister from 2010 to 2012 she controversially suggested that @entity25 should tell people they are fat rather than obese to help them lose weight			1
yesterday , mrs @entity0 said the overweight commuter ‘ roused from his slumber ’ as the train was waiting outside @entity32			2
she added : ‘ the man , his bottom and stomach have all now woken up and are slowly coming to life – whilst my bottom is now free			0
’ afterwards , mrs @entity0 told the @entity39 newspaper : ‘ if you are going to sit on one of those seats for three people , you need to take up one third of the seat			1
' if your bottom is bigger than a third then you need to reduce its size			0
’ however , some @entity50 users were unimpressed			1
one said : ‘ public transport is a nightmare , all know that			1
“ help i ’m sitting next to a fat person ! ” tweets only make it more uncomfortable ? ’ another tweeted : ‘ this is not the forum to vent such issues			0
as an mp you should have a little more decorum			0
’ and another post read : ‘ good to see our elected representatives treating people with such contempt			0
’ it was a morning of drama for mrs @entity0 as she had been knocked off her bicycle on the way to the station			2
she was left shaken but unhurt after being involved in a collision with a van			0
and she said she was only saved from injury by the frame of her bicycle , which was damaged			0
mrs @entity0 said : ‘ it was one of those things where we both started moving away from a junction and he [ the driver ] did n’t see me			2
he stopped and he was very nice			0
i ’m fully recovered and had no injury			0
i wanted to weep , so i started a @entity50 storm about big bottoms			2
