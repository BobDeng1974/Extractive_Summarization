public scandals and @entity2 security breeches have revealed a decline in the @entity4 after the agency spent decades as the gold - standard in law enforcement world			1
now , former agents and former leaders charged with overseeing the agency are hitting back - saying the @entity4 has been the victim of demands protect more people and accomplish more - all while the budget has remained flat or been cut			1
some lawmakers are n't buying this excuse and saying the @entity4 has been unaccountable for years and that leaders in the agency do n't have the proper oversight			2
battered : the @entity4 has come under increasing criticism for security lapses in gaffes in recent years the @entity23 reports that on september 11 , 2001 , the @entity4 was charged with protecting 18 people , including president @entity25 , his immediate family and the vice-president and his immediate family			1
after the attacks , @entity25 ordered the agency to begin protecting his extended family , including his four brothers and sister , and vice president @entity35 's adult daughters and his grandchildren			0
president @entity37 has largely continued that trend and currently			0
the @entity4 is in charge of protecting 27 people , including vice president @entity42 's school - age granddaughters and @entity37 's closest adviser , @entity43 , the @entity23 reports			1
each person requires two to six agents to protect them at a time and the agents work in two to three daily shifts for round - the - clock cover			2
the @entity4 says it needs @entity51 officers to protect the @entity2 , currently , it say only has 1,320 , the @entity23 says			1
even as the responsibilities have expanded , the staff of the @entity4 has stayed the same			2
a wave of early retirements from the 1990s to 2002 meant that 925 senior agents left the agency while they were still in their productive years , the @entity23 reports			0
all this has culminated in shocking shortcomings in protecting the president and the @entity2			2
offices from the uniform branch of the @entity4 , which guards the @entity2 , told the @entity23 they are often called in to work overtime on their days off because of a shortage of staff			1
short - handed : the @entity51 of the @entity4 , which protects the @entity2 , has 100 fewer officers than needed and continually asks agents to work overtime the agency has also canceled regular training sessions that keep officers current because the @entity4 ca n't afford to take them away from their jobs			1
additionally , because of a shortfall in funds , the agency decided to cancel all but three of its academy training classes - leading to a shortfall of new recruits , according to the @entity23			0
the @entity4 is also in charge of catching counterfeiters			0
since 9/11 , the agency was given the task of tracking online threats against financial institutions - further expanding their portfolio			0
it has also picked up responsibilities of monitoring large crowds at sports arenas and other events for possible terrorist threats , according to the @entity23			0
another blow to the agency , insiders claim , came when @entity25 ordered the @entity4 rolled into the new @entity92 following 9/11			2
it was formerly part of the @entity94 , which has deep pockets and treated the @entity4 like a crown jewel , the @entity23 reports			2
in @entity92 , former agents say , the @entity4 suddenly had to compete for money with much larger agencies @entity4 has about 6,200 employees			1
other @entity92 departments like the @entity102 and the @entity103 - which each have about 50,000			0
all this comes as the budget has mostly stayed flat - or even contracted a little			0
the 2013 budget was $ 1.5billion , down from $ 1.6billion the year before			1
the agency responded by cutting 300 jobs			0
' there was a competition for dollars in an increasingly finite budget environment , ' @entity110 , a former @entity92 official in the @entity111 , told the @entity23			0
@entity115 ( left ) was arrested after making into the @entity2 with a knife before @entity4 could stop him in september			2
@entity117 ( right ) is another @entity2 fencer jump this year on september 19 , an intruder armed with a knife jumped the @entity2 fence and made it inside the front door president 's home before he was finally tackled and arrested			0
director @entity125 resigned as a result of dramatic lapses from that incident - including @entity4 officers who were n't trained in how to respond to an intruder , radios that did n't work correctly and other stunning lapses in security			1
@entity134 herself took over in the wake of another scandal - the prostitution debacle in @entity139 2012 that saw several agents lose their jobs after they were caught partying hard and buying hookers while on an advance trip to scout security ahead of president @entity37 's arrival			0
despite pleas from current and former @entity4 agents for more money and resources , some in @entity152 say that the agency has never wanted for anything - and they it must learn to cut unnecessary fat			1
' i do nâ€™t think the @entity4 has been held accountable for the last 15 years , ' @entity159 @entity158 congressman @entity157 told the @entity23			0
@entity162 , the first secretary of homeland , @entity161 said : ' the entire focus of the nation shifted after 9/11 , and all federal agencies had to adjust to the new realities			0
' that said , the @entity4 , because of its protective mission and direct ties to the @entity2 , never suffered from a lack of resources to carry out their critical responsibilities during my time at @entity92			1
' earlier this month , a report from @entity92 blasted the budget management of the @entity4 because agency officials could n't even give a figure for how much it costs to protect the @entity2			1
' no one has really looked at how much the mission , done right , actually costs , ' the report found .			1

@entity4 protects 27 people now - up from 18 in 2011
budget has been cut from $ 1.6billion to $ 1.5billion and staff has been cut by 300
@entity51 , which protects the @entity2 , has 1,320 officers , 100 fewer than needed
move from @entity94 to @entity92 means the @entity4 has had to compete with bigger agencies for resources
officers protecting the @entity2 forced to work overtime and days off because there are too few staffers available
@entity92 report found that @entity4 does n't even know how much it costs to protect the @entity2
