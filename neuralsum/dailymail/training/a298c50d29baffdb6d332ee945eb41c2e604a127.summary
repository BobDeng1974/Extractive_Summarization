by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:17 est , 13 december 2013 updated : 20:54 est , 13 december 2013 three quarters of welfare cheats get away without punishment , official figures show			2
just one in four swindlers face legal action , undermining the government ’s claims that it is cracking down on benefit fraud			1
legal action was ruled out in 35,000 cases last year , with only 9,836 prosecuted by the @entity13 and the @entity14			1
and of those found guilty of ripping off the benefits system , just 4 per cent were handed a custodial sentence			1
official figures show how just one in four benefits cheats are prosecuted , with more than 35,000 avoiding court the embarrassing figures emerged after the @entity13 was criticised by the @entity23 spending watchdog for failing to act on fraud			1
the @entity25 this week refused to sign of the ministry ’s accounts for the 24th year in a row after the amount lost to fraudsters rose to £ 1.2billion			1
according to figures released in response to parliamentary questions , just a fraction of people cheating the system ever face the criminal courts			0
the size of the frauds has also increased			0
in 2010 - 11 there were just over 2,000 cases where more than £ 10,000 was fraudulently claimed			0
but in 2011 - 12 the number leapt to almost 3,000			0
in 2011 - 12 , the most recent year for which figures are available , just 403 benefits cheats were jailed while 8,911 were handed a non-custodial sentence			1
@entity48 ’s shadow welfare minister @entity47 said : ‘ i ’ve always thought that playing the system was the worst form of crime , because in essence it ’s stealing from everybody and in particular from the most vulnerable			0
‘ it undermines people ’s confidence in the whole system , which is why @entity9 should come down heavily where there is real fraud and abuse			1
’ they are words which have come back to haunt the prime minister			0
in august 2010 , @entity64 delivered a major speech on benefits insisting the coalition would take action to reduce fraud			1
he condemned the @entity48 government for failing to tacakle the problem and suggested firms could be paid a ‘ bounty ’ for every benefit cheat they identify			0
speaking at a public meeting in @entity78 , the prime minister said he wanted to see an ‘ uncompromising ’ crackdown on fraud			1
he added : ' we 're not going to shrug our shoulders and let these people get away with it any longer			0
' cutting benefit fraud is a no - brainer			2
that 's why benefit fraud is the first and the deepest cut we will make			2
' but the figures show that since 2010 the amount lost in fraud has not changed at £ 1.2billion			2
however , the @entity13 said new penalties mean fraudsters can be fined up to £ 2,000 with without being taken to court			1
officials can also impose a £ 50 civil penalty where a claimant gives false information about their circumstances which results in an overpayment			0
a @entity13 spokesperson said : ‘ we are determined to stop fraudsters who see benefits as a way of lining their pockets			1
‘ we are giving our investigators the resources to catch these criminals and always push hard for the strongest punishments			0
‘ we look to ensure overpayments are repaid even if cases do not end up in court , and we have introduced civil penalties to deter claimants from making errors in their claims that lead to overpayments			2
’ overall fraud and error in the benefits system has risen to a record £ 110 a second			2
the @entity25 said losses climbed by more than 9 per cent last year to an ‘ unacceptable ’ £ 3.5billion			1
benefit fraud rose by £ 100million to £ 1.2billion last year compared with 2011/12			1
overpayments due to errors by claimants and officials went up £ 200million to £ 2.3billion			0
in 2012 - 13 a total of £ 1.2billion was lost in fraud overpayments , including £ 800million in benefits handed out by the @entity13 and a further £ 400million lost in payments made by local councils			1
in 2011 - 12 the figure was £ 1.1billion , still markedly up on £ 800million in 2007 - 08			0
@entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 were most likely to be used to con the taxpayer out of money , the @entity25 said , because ‘ they require the claimant to supply complete and accurate information in order to establish entitlement to benefit ’			0
the biggest scam involves claiming benefits as a single person while living with a partner , or lying about income levels and working cash in hand			0
@entity25 chief @entity157 has ‘ qualified ’ the @entity13 accounts as a result of fraud and error which remains ‘ unacceptably high ’			1
the accounts of the department and its predecessors have received similar qualified audit opinions since 1988 - 89			0
mr @entity157 said : ‘ i am still concerned about the continuing high level of fraud and error in benefits expenditure			2
issuing an audit qualification is a serious matter , and the fact that similar qualifications have followed one another over so many years does not lessen that seriousness .			0

just 9,836 fraudsters out of more than *45,000* were prosecuted last year
only 4 *%* of those who went to court were given a jail sentence
@entity13 *rebuked* after fraud losses rose
