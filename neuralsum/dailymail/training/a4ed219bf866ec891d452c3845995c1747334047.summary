pardon the pun : but @entity1 is a.			2
but now , perhaps , he 's found one he can master			0
the @entity4 midfielder excelled in a deep - lying midfield role in @entity7 's excellent 2 - 0 win in @entity8 on monday night			1
under @entity10 , the 22 - year - old has been deployed in various midfield roles - he 's even been played out on the right - hand side in certain games last season			2
but the presence of @entity33 and @entity34 means he is way down the @entity4 pecking order to play in the ' hole '			1
you can like our @entity38 here then there 's the advanced central midfield role , but @entity43 has that position on lockdown at the moment			2
that leaves one position left in the @entity4 engine room : central defensive midfield			2
attributes : @entity10 believes his midfield man has the abilities to play further back strong : @entity1 has always been a player who can dive into a tackle , but can improve that part of his game covering : the 22 - year - old midfielder was required to do a lot more defensive work against @entity8 wenger has been criticised by @entity4 fans for not signing a new deep - lying midfielder during the transfer window , despite strong interest in @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			1
but is there a method in his perceived madness ? as @entity73 revealed in july , @entity10 believes @entity1 has the attributes to play in that holding role			1
the @entity4 manager has gone on record to say he prefers @entity1 in an advanced role , but the question is : does he get in @entity4 's full - strength midfield ? arguably , not			1
who needs a new signing ? @entity1 can slot into the role @entity4 fans hoped would be filled by @entity85 watching on : @entity10 has overseen @entity87 's development from young hopeful to @entity7 star but the one position he does have a chance of nailing down is that deep - lying role			1
he certainly has it in the locker			0
he 's an accurate and economical passer , who , even at the age of 22 , has an understanding of the game way beyond his years			0
however , he does lack , to a certain degree , a physical presence			0
at 5ft 7ins he is n't the biggest , particularly compared to the likes of @entity102 monsters @entity103 and @entity104			0
setbacks : the 22 - year - old has had injury troubles but hopes to be over the worst of them now but @entity109 or @entity110 , his prime competitors for that role , are n't particularly imposing either			0
so , until @entity10 bites the bullet and signs a dominant central midfielder supporters so desperately want , then @entity1 has the opportunity to make that position his own			1
the willingness is certainly there : ' i spoke with the manager and @entity121 in the week and they told me they wanted me to play that role and i quite enjoyed it , ' it was my first time ever playing there , so over the next month or so i am going to look at a few videos of the game and of players who play in that position regularly - @entity16 , @entity132 and players like that and i 'll get better			0
' i felt it went well tonight but next time we meet up i feel it can only go better			0

@entity1 has *usualy* played further *forward* but showed on monday that he can perform in the holding role
@entity141 has fallen down the pecking order in number 10 position at @entity4
@entity33 and @entity34 preferred ' in the hole '
@entity10 keen to use @entity1 from a deeper position
