by @entity0 @entity1 : 06:45 est , 18 december 2013 @entity2 : 08:54 est , 18 december 2013 you have to wonder what went through @entity6 's head - apart from excruciating pain - as he slipped in his home and fell down the stairs , banging his skull on each step as he went			1
the good news , according to @entity6 , a 25 - year - old electrician from @entity12 , is that only one of the baubles in the box he was carrying was damaged			1
' one lost a few spikes , but i came off worse than the decorations			0
i had a headache for days			0
' three years before he had another headache that lasted a week when his father dropped the bracket for a glitter ball on his head			0
' i had a bit of a sit down then i carried on decorating			0

the display contains hundreds of lights , 15 outdoor sockets , three ex-blackpool displays , a strobe , two lasers , a 4ft snowman and 68 metres of ropelight , and is all computerised and set to music @entity49 got the idea after seeing how @entity62 decorate their homes on a trip to @entity64 in the 70s and he was one of the first in @entity67 to go to such lengths at a few weeks short of 80 , @entity69 , known to locals in his hometown of @entity72 as mr @entity38 , has been decorating his home since 1978 ' i 've no idea how much i spend but we 've got hundreds of lights , 15 outdoor sockets , three ex-blackpool displays , a strobe , two lasers , a 4ft snowman and 68 metres of ropelight			1

it 's all computerised and set to music so it looks as though the lights are dancing			1
' @entity6 is one of a growing band of enthusiasts who spend hundreds of pounds turning their homes into winter wonderlands at @entity38			1
now @entity93 is taking a peek inside their bauble - draped homes for a one - off show			1
unsurprisingly , the men - and it 's usually men - for whom ' putting up the @entity38 lights ' requires military planning , extendable ladders and hefty electricity bills tend to be pretty colourful characters themselves			1
@entity6 has been decorating the home he shares with street cleaner father @entity106 and care assistant mother @entity108 since he was 14 , but he got the bug when he was six months old on a trip to see the @entity111			2
mr @entity112 , from @entity113 in @entity114 , decorates his house every @entity38 with thousands of lights and ornaments mr @entity112 stands proudly with one of his many light displays in front of his house ' i only stopped crying when the pram hood was down			1
@entity124 thinks it 's because i could n't see the lights with it up ! ' now they have lights stored in their attic , bedrooms and even on the landing			2
' you get used to seeing a 6ft @entity134 on the stairs in summer ! ' says @entity6			2
at a few weeks short of 80 , @entity69 , known to locals in his hometown of @entity72 as mr @entity38 , has been decorating his home since 1978			1
' i 'll keep going until i ca n’t get up the ladder , ' chuckles @entity49 , who 's made £ 45,000 for charity over the years			2
he got the idea after seeing how @entity62 decorate their homes on a trip to @entity64 in the 70s and he was one of the first in @entity67 to go to such lengths			0
the incredible light display on @entity149 and @entity151 's home in @entity152 , near @entity153 , @entity154 the @entity151 's spend about £ 900 on electricity in december and about £ 750 a year on lights			1
there is a @entity159 area with penguins and a @entity134 section with big sacks of toys the couple 's enthusiasm is infectious and even the neighbours opposite ca n't raise a complaint			0
' though they have put up blackout blinds , ' laughs @entity151 @entity154 builder @entity151 , 55 , spent much of his childhood in foster homes and never had a proper @entity38 until he met @entity149 , 53 ' we just did it for us , my wife and i , to begin with but when people started throwing money on the lawn we decided we 'd collect for charity			1
now we get about 700 people at switch - on night			0
' but the most poignant of all is the tale of @entity151 and @entity184			0
@entity154 builder @entity151 , 55 , spent much of his childhood in foster homes and never had a proper @entity38 until he met @entity149 , 53			1
' when i was young @entity124 was always running away and @entity187 ran after her , so me and my brother and sisters would get taken into separate foster homes			0
i only remember two christmases when we were in our own home , and at foster homes the people never had money for presents , ' he says			0
it was only when he started dating @entity149 and she filled her old @entity134 sack with presents for him that he realised what he 'd been missing			0
but even she did n't realised just how hooked on christmas @entity151 would become			0
' we spend about £ 900 on electricity in december and about £ 750 a year on lights			1

' though they have put up blackout blinds , ' laughs @entity151			0
in fact a sense of goodwill is evident in the communities where all the light fanatics live			0
@entity6 and his father were persuaded by locals to keep their display when a stand - off with vandals saw @entity106 lose a tooth			1
and @entity69 says he could n't carry on without the neighbours who hand out mince pies and let visitors stand on their lawn			2
plastic santas and flashing lights may not feature in the traditional @entity234 story but it 's hard not to conclude that these neighbourly souls embody the true spirit of @entity38			2
