for any @entity2 club looking to rebuild on the cheap this summer , there are a few bargains to be had			0
not every close - season addition must come at club - record expense or be prised from a rival			0
the advent of the @entity9 ruling has seen the market flooded with free agents in recent years , the temptation to bring in a new face at no cost proving an attractive proposition for would - be suitors			1
this summer is no different			0
here , @entity17 runs you through our free - transfer @entity19 ( formation : 4 - 3 - 3 )			1
free trade : @entity23 and @entity24 could both be up for grabs this summer goalkeeper : @entity27 ( @entity28 ) he ’s getting on – he ’ll turn 43 on sunday – but there are a few saves left in the @entity32 ’s glovebag yet			2
until the arrival of @entity34 at @entity35 in 2012 , he had played every minute of the previous eight @entity2 seasons			0
he only made six starts in all competitions this time around but would still make an able deputy for a top - flight club in need of an experienced head and reliable pair of hands			0
right back : @entity45 ( @entity46 ) named in @entity49 ’s provisional @entity48 squad , @entity45 will be one of the most sought - after frees this summer			1
@entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 are all circling and the absence of a transfer fee should see his £ 100,000 - per - week wage demands satisfied			2
something for nothing : @entity58 rivals @entity27 and @entity45 are out of contract this summer centre back : @entity60 ( @entity61 ) unceremoniously dumped after 12 years at @entity62 , he will have no shortage of admirers over the coming months			1
former @entity61 defender @entity65 , now in charge of @entity67 , has already hinted that @entity60 ’s number is on speed - dial and the 35 - year - old will want a starting role having been a spectator for much of @entity61 ’s calamitous campaign			1
centre back : @entity74 ( @entity50 ) just five years ago @entity74 was a £ 22m @entity75 player on his way to the @entity77 as @entity50 ’s rapid rebuild gathered pace			1
two @entity2 winner 's medals later and he is heading for the exit door having made eight appearances this season			0
@entity74 is still just 31 and , given he satisfies the homegrown quota , could well attract interest from a top - six club			1
@entity61 : @entity87 defensive pair @entity60 and @entity74 have been released left back : @entity24 ( @entity52 ) snubbed by @entity75 , @entity24 will not feel so unwanted when the scramble for his signature begins			1
he is perhaps the prize pick of all the players up for grabs this summer and there is an argument to say he remains one of the best left - backs in the @entity2			2
left midfield : @entity97 ( @entity61 ) after eight seasons at @entity62 - and five @entity2 titles - @entity97 will be moving on this summer			1
he 's still good enough to warrant a place in the @entity49 squad and , given his 33 league outings for @entity61 this season , there are still plenty of miles in the tank			0
it would n't be a surprise to see him back in the @entity110 next year			2
available : @entity111 backs @entity24 and @entity97 ( who is in our midfield ) will have no shortage of suitors @entity118 midfield : @entity23 ( @entity52 ) the 35 - year - old is the only member of @entity75 ’s @entity48 squad who could leave on a free during the close - season and , were he to serve a reminder of his talent at the finals , it could well trigger a race for his services			1
he appeared 26 times for @entity52 in the league this season – scoring six times – and would remain a dependable presence at the heart of any midfield			0
right midfield : @entity136 ( @entity137 ) his return to @entity137 has not , it is fair to reflect , been a success			2
nonetheless , there will no doubt be one top - flight club willing to take a punt on the former @entity75 forward			2
in it together : ex-west @entity137 , @entity52 and @entity75 stars @entity23 and @entity136 face uncertain futures striker : @entity150 ( @entity151 ) he may have scored just three goals this season but @entity150 will be an attractive proposition for promoted clubs in the market for an experienced target man			1
he has made north of 23 league appearances in each of the last four campaigns and , should he shine at the @entity48 with @entity161 , will not be short of interested parties			0
striker : @entity164 ( @entity46 ) after nine years in @entity58 – and not a single trophy - the @entity165 will finally bid a not - so - fond farewell to the @entity168			0
he will no doubt talk of a transfer tussle between @entity170 and @entity171 , but the likelihood is that a mid-table @entity2 club could be the setting for his rehabilitation			1
forward thinking : @entity150 and @entity164 could attract interest from @entity2 newcomers striker : @entity179 ( @entity52 ) nine goals from 16 league starts is a fair return but , it appears , not fair enough for @entity184			0
the @entity186 striker will be released this summer and the lure of his name – not to mention his goal threat – should be enough to persuade one top - flight admirer to meet his wage demands			0
on target : @entity179 scored nine league goals for @entity52 this season			0

out - of - contract stars set to spark transfer tussle this summer
@entity60 , @entity97 and @entity45 also among big names available on a free
@entity136 and @entity74 will cost nothing
