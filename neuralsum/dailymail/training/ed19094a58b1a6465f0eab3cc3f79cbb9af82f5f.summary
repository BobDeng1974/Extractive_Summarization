by @entity0 every responsible animal lover knows it ’s one of the first things to teach a pet - how to respond to their own name			0
but new research shows that although cats recognise their owners ’ voice , they choose to ignore when they are being called because of the way the species evolved			1
a new study from the @entity14 suggests that because cats are able to ‘ domesticate themselves ’ they have n’t relied on the human voice for instruction over the centuries			1
independent : a new study from the @entity14 suggests that because cats are able to ' domesticate themselves ' they have n't relied on the human voice for instruction over the centuries they have a reputation for being an aloof and independent species - in contrast to their canine counterparts			1
and the study proves that cats are now unresponsive to their owners because they did n’t need to take notice of humans throughout the evolutionary process			1
researchers found that when owners could n’t be seen and called to their cats by name , the pets moved their heads in the direction of the noise and pricked up their ears in response			1
when the same experiment was carried out with a stranger ’s voice , the cats were found to be significantly less responsive			0
in both cases , they recognised the call and choose not to respond to it			0
@entity56 and @entity57 , the researchers who led the project , said : ‘ this cat – owner relationship is in contrast to that with dogs			0
‘ cats do not actively respond with communicative behaviour to owners who are calling them from out of sight , even though they can distinguish their owners ’ voices			2
’ relationship : historically speaking , cats , unlike dogs , have not been trained to obey a human 's orders the study tested twenty cats at home and analysed their responses to each call by measuring their movement , vocalization and eye dilation			2
the reason for the cats indifference is believed to be rooted in the early domestication of the species			0
‘ historically speaking , cats , unlike dogs , have not been domesticated to obey humans ’ orders			1
rather , they seem to take the initiative in human – cat interaction			0
’ genetic analysis shows that the common ancestor of the modern housecat was @entity100 , a small wildcat that came into contact with humans more than 9,000 years ago			0
the species is then thought to have domesticated itself without answering directly to humans			2
despite their independence , cats are reported to be as affectionate as dogs by their owners			1
the study said that ‘ the behavioural aspect of cats that cause their owners to become attached to them are still undetermined			2
‘ dog owners and cat owners do not differ significantly in their reported attachment level to their pets ’ .			0

research by the @entity14 says cats are self - domesticated
this means they do not rely on instructions given by humans
despite their independence , cats are reported to be as affectionate as dogs by their owners
