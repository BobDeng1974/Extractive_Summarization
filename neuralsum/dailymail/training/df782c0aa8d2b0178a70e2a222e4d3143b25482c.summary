i think we all know			0
’ she said her father was an outspoken critic of the @entity3 president and had predicted the current crisis in the @entity59			1
‘ my father was saying @entity6 was a danger to the whole world and we can see that now , ’ she added			0
‘ my father was saying [ @entity65 ] @entity64 does not understand how @entity59 is important			0
he was the first person saying it			0
for 14 years he ’s been saying that			0
’ however , mr @entity54 said the last known assassination attempt was in 2007 and asked why he would have been a target at the time of his death as he had ceased to be politically active because of his depression			0
but miss @entity9 , an artist , said that just because her father had lost all interest in politics in the six months before his death , it did not mean he stopped being a target			2
