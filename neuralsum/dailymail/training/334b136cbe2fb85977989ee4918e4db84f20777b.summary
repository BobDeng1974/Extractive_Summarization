by @entity0 published : 06:51 est , 17 june 2013 updated : 06:54 est , 18 june 2013 moors murderer @entity1 made his first public appearance in decades yesterday without showing a flicker of remorse for his despicable crimes			2
he described the slaughter of five children as ' petty ' , doctors revealed – and compared his behaviour to the acts of soldiers and politicians in war			0
his cold assessment of the murders that horrified a nation emerged at a hearing to decide whether he should be released from a secure hospital and allowed to die in prison			1
two faces of a killer : a sketch of @entity25 , feeding tube in nose , and , right , in 1965 moors murderer @entity1 was glimpsed today in the tribunal room at the maximum security @entity30 in @entity31			1
he wore a pair of dark spectacles and had what looked like a tube up his nose court artist sketch of @entity25 ( left ) appearing via video at the mental health tribunal , the first time he has been seen in public for decades it is the only time 75 - year - old @entity25 has been seen in public since he was jailed for life with @entity45 in 1966 , save for a long - lens photograph taken in 1987 when police took him back to the scene of his crimes on @entity50 near @entity51			1
thus , with grotesque irony , the man who denied his pleading victims the right to live took centre stage to fight for the right to die			2
he is using taxpayers ' money to ask a mental health tribunal to allow him to transfer from @entity30 , @entity31 , where he has been on hunger strike for the past 13 years , so he can ' take control ' of the time and manner of his death			1
in a featureless room at the high - security hospital yesterday , doctors gave evidence to a judge and medical panel about whether @entity25 was psychotic or schizophrenic , or sane enough to see out his life in jail			1
he sat taking almost continuous notes – a slim , slightly hunched figure in dark glasses and a dark - coloured jacket , with a full head of hair , grey now , but still swept back in the teddy - boy style he sported in the early 1960s			2
his complexion looked perfect on the screens that broadcast proceedings in public to the @entity86 some 40 miles away in @entity51			0
at @entity30 , @entity25 is fed via a tube and yesterday it was taped to the right side of his lip , leading to one nostril , the only indication of his physical condition among all the talk of his mental state			1
yet in rare moments when he looked up from his foolscap pad , he still had that air of menace			0
you had to remind yourself that somewhere in his twisted , evil mind , the chilling detail must still be lurking – names of every victim that he and @entity45 killed : dates , method of torture , manner of death			0
crucially , perhaps , he might even have known the precise location where a 12 - year - old boy , still missing half a century later , was buried			2
@entity25 and @entity45 murdered five youngsters in the 1960s			1
the victims were lured to their deaths , sexually tortured and buried on the moors			0
link : proceedings are being relayed by video to @entity119 and relatives of @entity25 and fellow killer @entity45 's victims at a court 40 miles away in @entity51 the mental health tribunal itself is taking place behind closed doors at @entity30 on @entity31 @entity25 was last photographed helping police search for the remains of two of his victims on @entity50 in 1987 , but has not been seen in public since their trial in 1966 @entity133 , 16 , vanished on her way to a disco on july 12 , 1963			1
@entity136 , 12 , was snatched in november the same year			0
@entity137 was taken on june 16 , 1964 after he left home to visit his grandmother			0
@entity140 , ten , was lured from a funfair on @entity142 , 1964			0
@entity1 , 17 , was killed in october 1965			0
@entity25 was given life at @entity144 in 1966 for the murders of @entity136 , @entity140 and @entity1			1
@entity45 , who died in prison in 2002 aged 60 , was convicted of killing @entity140 and @entity1 , and of shielding @entity25			1
she was also jailed for life			0
in 1987 the pair finally admitted killing @entity137 and @entity149			0
moors murder victim @entity140 , who was just 10 when she was sadistically murdered but tribunal judge @entity150 made it clear yesterday this was not an inquiry into @entity25 's crimes ; nor would he be asked the whereabouts of @entity137			1
what quickly became apparent was that , despite the earnest nature of the proceedings – swamped with medical opinion and diagnosis , and peppered with specialist terms – this was the @entity1 show			0
he has fought for years to get this platform and is expected to give evidence later			0
yesterday he addressed the judge only once , mumbling in a quiet , gravelled , voice , tinged with a @entity168 accent			1
he leaned over repeatedly to whisper to his lawyer – she appeared at one stage to put her fingers to her lips to quieten him			0
@entity25 did not look at the camera once during more than four hours but simply to appear was grandstanding enough			2
this was only the second time such a hearing has opened its doors to public scrutiny , and , in this case , to relatives or friends of the dead			0
@entity183 , @entity137 's brother , watched the hearing and afterwards accused @entity25 of ' attention - seeking '			1
on his blog , he added : ' @entity25 looked fit and well which is what i expected after being told many times over the years that he has never been fitter , despite his farcical supposed “ hunger strike ”			1
' the hearing was described as a ' macabre game ' by @entity194 , the solicitor who represented @entity137 's mother @entity1 until she died last year			2
the tribunal referred to the killer throughout as ' mr @entity25 ' and heard arguments for and against suggestions that he is mentally ill. innocent : @entity137 ( left ) and @entity136 ( right ) were murdered by @entity1			1
@entity137 's body is still missing			2
@entity25 has never revealed the whereabouts of the 12 - year - old 's body @entity205 search : police scour @entity50 for the bodies of the children killed by @entity1 in this 1986 file picture @entity1 ( right ) arriving at court by taxi in 1966			1
he is @entity213 's longest - serving prisoner evil : @entity45 died in hospital aged 60 after suffering respiratory failure in 2002 dr @entity217 , the medical member of the tribunal panel , said he met @entity25 last week			1
' asked if he wanted to die , he refused to answer , ' he said			0
@entity25 denied being psychotic and claimed he had only been ' acting ' when displaying such symptoms			2
dr @entity217 said he asked @entity221 about the @entity1			0
' he said it was an existential exercise , personal philosophy and interpretation and in some way his behaviour was petty compared to politicians and soldiers in relation to wars			0
' he said @entity25 believed the tribunal was not independent and its decision would be ' a political one '			1
dr @entity234 , a forensic psychiatrist who examined @entity25 on behalf of his legal team , said despite his behaviour , there was no evidence he was mentally ill. @entity25 claimed he had learned to copy symptoms of mental illness while working as a cleaner at @entity241 , he said			1
it was ' inconceivable ' that he would be sent to a secure hospital were he to be assessed today			0
@entity25 did exhibit ' delusions ' and believed staff at @entity30 mounted ' conspiracies ' against him			2
but this ' paranoia ' was a feature of his serious personality disorder			0
as @entity25 displayed ' hostility and contempt ' towards any attempt at therapy , there was no value in continuing to detain him at @entity30 , dr @entity234 said			2

child killer 's mental health tribunal began yesterday
he has been on hunger strike for a decade and is force - fed via a tube
@entity25 wants to get out of his high security hospital and die in jail
he was heard *murmuring* questions to judge in strong @entity272 accent
