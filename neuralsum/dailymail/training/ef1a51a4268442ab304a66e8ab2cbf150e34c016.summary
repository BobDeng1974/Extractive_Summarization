' it was n't the first time you targeted this man			0
well you say you are sorry , so you should be and i have read the impact statement from his daughter			0
i have read it three times now , it makes me want to weep			0
' here is grandfather , a great grandfather a beloved father lost to this family in the anguish that that it has heaped upon them because of you selfishness and your addiction to drugs			0
' standing guard : a policeman outside the bungalow where the pensioner was scared to death when he came face - to - face with @entity7 as he burgled him terrible : @entity7 set fire to the bungalow home of @entity10 in @entity19 , @entity13 , with him dead inside devastating : @entity10 's scorched chair and the remains of a bench after the arson attack remains : this is a pile of charred items from the house left after @entity7 's callous blaze , which he used to cover - up his crimes @entity98 was told mr @entity10 described as am ' eccentric and well off ' old man was a talented linguist and had lived at his home for 40 years			1

but it was feared news of his wealth was well known in the locality and @entity7 and his partner @entity29 decided to rob him			2
initially @entity7 sneaked into the house unbeknown to pensioner who was asleep in his downstairs bedroom			1
@entity7 searched the bungalow for two and a half hours and stole mr @entity10 's bank card whist @entity117 waited outside on the old man 's driveway as a lookout			1

he then suffered his fatal seizure			0
despite being unable to find a conclusive cause of death , a pathologist said the fear mr @entity10 had felt when he discovered @entity7 in his home , combined with the shock of having a door slammed in to his face , could have proved fatal			1

passing sentence the judge added : ' you broke into his house the two of you and were in there for two and a half house on the night			2
' it is not known precisely what you did on the occasions and it will never fully be known because only you knew what happened but drawers had been opened and searched			0
' the telephone jack had been removed from the wall probably on the first visit and you emerged two and a half hours later with a bag of spoils and most particularly his wallet and bank cards but he had changed his pin number over recent days presumably because of people like you , he was worried that he would be taken for another ride			0
' it has to be accepted that this gentleman 's death was probably almost certainly caused by cardiac arrest out of fear and shock			2
he was relatively healthy otherwise from having heart disease			0
@entity194 have accepted that he died during that second occasion but only you @entity7 knew the real truth			2
' you proceeded to destroy his house by fire and in doing so succeeded in destroying evidence which would have been subject to forensic investigation - how wicked			2
' in the impact statement it makes it clear the fire is a great part of this tragedy for the family having been unable to say goodbye to mr @entity10			2
the whole house was destroyed having to be knocked down and rebuilt at massive cost			0
' you spent some time together trying to create a story that would stand up			0
a story that regularly changed			0
you were doing your very best to cover your tracks			0
' ' whatever happened this was far from being a murder case but difficult to imagine a worse case of manslaughter with more aggravating features , the vulnerability , the arson the burglary , the fire , you set fire to his house , you still attempted to use his bank card			1
