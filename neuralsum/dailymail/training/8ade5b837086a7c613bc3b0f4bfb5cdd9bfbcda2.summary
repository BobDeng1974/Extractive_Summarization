the federal government has sent more than 37,000 illegal immigrant children to adults in every part of the @entity6 who claimed to be their guardians during the first seven months of 2014 , data from the @entity1 show			1
but tens of thousands more are languishing in 116 shelters operated with taxpayer dollars in at least 16 states			1
@entity12 says more than 66,000 unaccompanied children were apprehended after crossing the border illegally between october 1 , 2013 and the end of this august – an 88 per cent increase over the last fiscal year with one month left to go			2
@entity1 released more than 56 per cent of the children to family members in all 50 states , the @entity18 , @entity19 and the @entity20 between january and july , according to information the agency sent @entity25 and shown in a map below			1
in addition to the 116 shelters housing the rest , an estimated 28,000 kids , the feds have also proposed to open another 46 shelters in 27 states to help cope with the influx			2
the crisis has stemmed from an unprecedented flood of underage would - be @entity6 , often fleeing violence in @entity38 and drawn by the lure of a @entity40 eager to mainstream them			1
@entity1 does n't take any action to determine whether those claiming the minors are themselves in the @entity6 legally			0
the @entity68 reported in august that the @entity69 had deported just 294 @entity38 from among the tens of thousands stretching @entity6 hospitality to its breaking point			1
meanwhile @entity1 , through its ' unaccompanied alien children ' program , sent 50 or more children and teens to live with ' guardians ' in at least 128 @entity6 counties			1
adding to the complicated picture , the @entity79 reported this week that @entity1 data indicate taxpayers will cover $ 761 million in expenses related to educating children placed in those counties			2
few are fluent in @entity85 , and in some cases the flood of new students has overwhelmed already - crowded classrooms			0
and while the @entity57 administration has been quick to boast how many of the 37,477 former detainees it has reunited with self - described family members , it has been silent on how many children are still housed in what has become a collection of third - world orphanages			1
the @entity99 reported thursday that a recent @entity69 contract included a list of ' 116 facilities that have been used to house children this year			1
' the shelters have been featured in handfuls of local news stories			0
@entity107 , a strident ' immigration - reduction ' group , provided @entity25 with a map showing most of those locations			0
those facilities , run mostly by organizations that receive 8 - and 9 - figure government grants , have become the stuff of secrecy			2
this map from @entity107 , an ' immigration - reduction ' group , uses red ' warning ' triangles for existing shelters yellow map pins for proposed new shelters , and blue push - pins to show where communities have beaten back federal government plans to open new facilities sen. @entity125 is demanding information from @entity1 about how the @entity57 administration decides where to spend hundreds of millions of dollars caring for children in the @entity6 alone and illegally one , @entity129 ( @entity130 ) , received more than $ 280 million this year to house illegal immigrant children , according to government records			1
@entity133 reported in august that it has deployed 1,400 employees this year alone to staff its shelters			0
more than 95 per cent of that group 's budget in 2012 came from the federal government , according to its tax records			0
but even members of @entity142 ca n't get answers about the arrangement it has with @entity1			0
after president @entity57 requested $ 3.7 billion in july to grapple with the surge in child illegal immigrant border - crossings , @entity146 @entity125 sen. @entity125 wrote to hhs secretary @entity150 , demanding an account of how the money would be spent			1
@entity150 had previously testified that it can cost her agency as much as $ 1,000 per day to house , clothe , educate , feed and provide medicare care for each child			0
' despite being almost completely dependent on the public , @entity130 has faced heavy criticism for attempting to avoid public scrutiny , ' @entity125 wrote			0
' @entity130 staff prohibited a member of @entity142 from entering the taxpayer - funded detention center at @entity165 ; prevented a @entity68 reporter from interviewing detainees , caseworkers , and other staff ; physically pushed a local tv reporter from the entrance of a facility ; and attempted to block the reporter ’s camera crew from recording across the street from the facility			0
' lucky ones : these @entity38 children aboard a cargo train headed north are traveling with their mother , while most come by themselves or with paid ' coyote ' smugglers investigative journalist @entity183 says government officials have blocked her attempts to find out more via the @entity186			1
' it 's yet one more case in which the federal government now routinely keeps secret information that is undeniably public and has a tremendous impact on the public , ' @entity183 told @entity25 on thursday			2
' how can @entity142 conduct its oversight role on impact and the contracts being written for tens of millions of tax dollars to care for the minors , ' she asked , ' when the government is withholding the most basic information ? ' in a reported story for @entity205 television affiliates , the president of a group that opposes illegal immigration told @entity183 that the @entity57 administration should explain itself			1
' it 's outrageous , ' the @entity79 's @entity207 said			0
' now , this administration is telling the @entity6 people – and @entity142 – that we ’re not even entitled to know where these people are , where they ’re being held , what communities are going to be impacted			2
' @entity183 is gearing up to promote ' stonewalled , ' a book slated for november release , chronicling her oft - blocked attempts to squeeze public information out of the @entity40 and its satellite agencies .			0

37,477 illegal immigrant children were handed over to relatives or other ' guardians ' this year in 50 states , @entity18 , @entity19 and the @entity20
@entity6 government says 66,127 were apprehended so far , leaving tens of thousands languishing in 116 temporary shelters across 16 states
the @entity57 administration is stonewalling @entity186 requests for information about contracts it issues to run the facilities
one @entity238 *charity* has received more than $ 280 million this year in federal funds to house the children , mostly from @entity38 countries
