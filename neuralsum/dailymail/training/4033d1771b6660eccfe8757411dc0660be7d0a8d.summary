by @entity0 published : 04:50 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 09:16 est , 20 september 2013 he does n’t juggle , ride a unicycle or – as far as anyone knows – own an exploding car			0
nor are you ever likely to see him at a children ’s party , thank goodness			0
this is possibly @entity10 ’s creepiest clown , who is terrifying people by popping up on darkened streets and in the process turning himself into a global internet sensation			2
perhaps it has something to do with the fact that he models himself on a fictional child killer from the @entity24 horror story it , and first showed up on friday the 13th			1
’ unashamed but not unmasked , the figure , who wants to stay anonymous , declared this week it was just ‘ harmless fun ’			0
‘ i just wanted to amuse people , ’ he said			0
‘ most people enjoy being a bit freaked out and then they can laugh about it afterwards			0
it ’s like watching a horror movie			0
when people get scared they usually start laughing			0
’ the ‘ @entity27 ’ has amassed an international following after @entity50 and other websites showed photos of him standing motionless , waving or staring at passers - by – sometimes carrying a teddy bear or holding a bunch of balloons			1
bizarre : appearances of the clown , who was seen waving and holding balloons and a teddy bear , had left residents of the @entity65 town baffled clowning around : the clown has vowed to continue appearing in the town even though he says it is difficult to keep his identity a secret such is his following that his @entity36 page , called @entity73 ’s @entity27 , now has almost 130,000 fans			1
his make - up and outfit bear a startling resemblance to @entity78 , the sinister circus joker in the movie of @entity24 ’s novel it and he has even adopted the character ’s catchphrase , ‘ beep beep ! ’ one couple on holiday from @entity87 travelled from @entity88 to search for the clown because they were fans of the film			1
but although many have applauded his exploits , some have failed to see the funny side			0
earlier this week , a ‘ vigilante ’ calling himself @entity100 - catcher set out to trap the mysterious figure			2
and on the @entity36 site , @entity101 wrote : ‘ you ’ve been spotted – now get out of the clown suit and start acting like a grown - up ... and stop scaring people as some people do have real fears of clowns , and you are terrorising them despite what you may say			1
’ in contrast , @entity113 urged people not to harm the man in the red wig and white painted face , adding : ‘ loving all this , it ’s brightened up boring old @entity27 a treat , people need to stop taking things so serious and just enjoy the fun , do n’t try and ruin it , and please do n’t be violent towards the clown			1
’ worldwide fame : the @entity27 's @entity36 page has attracted around 125,000 likes not trying to be sinister : the clown was threatened with violence by some @entity36 users after he started appearing on friday 13 an @entity131 observer suggested he should visit @entity132 ‘ and replace the clown in the @entity133 ’ – a reference to president @entity135			1
someone even argued that the appearances captured local imagination because they took place in a town he dubbed ‘ nothing - happening - ton ’			1
there has been feverish speculation over the clown ’s identity , with one blogger naming a local actor who recently appeared in a @entity50 film as a clown			2
it was noted that a backdrop in the footage was identical to that in a photograph of the @entity27			2
clowns were first recorded in @entity155 and although they traditionally play comic roles , modern cinema has frequently cast them as sinister villains			0
meanwhile , the @entity27 ’s sudden appearances are set to continue			1
he said he intends to keep popping up ‘ for as long as people are interested ’ .			0
