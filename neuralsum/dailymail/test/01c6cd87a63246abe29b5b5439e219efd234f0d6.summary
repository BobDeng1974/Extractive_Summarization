a federal judge has ordered the @entity1 to hand over a list of the 298 tea party organizations that it targeted with broad and often intrusive questions when they applied for nonprofit tax - exempt status			1
the decision from @entity10 district judge @entity9 means right - wing groups are a step closer to being allowed to pursue a class - action lawsuit against the @entity1			1
the agency has admitted playing political favorites with the tax code beginning in 2010 , when it began applying extra scrutiny to groups with red - flag words like ' patriots ' or ' tea party ' in their names			2
while those organizations ' applications were held up for years , liberal groups sailed through the process			2
federal tax - exempt status is confered on groups that serve a public purpose , including issue advocacy , and allows them to promise tax deductions to their donors			1
@entity9 agreed this week that the tea party groups suing the government can pursue their claims that the @entity1 violated their @entity69 rights , along with a section of federal law – section 6103 of @entity72 – that prohibits the government from releasing private information contained in tax returns			2
when the @entity79 's @entity78 investigated the @entity1 's actions , it demanded – and received – a list of 298 groups whose tax - exemption applications had been held up			1
it 's this list that the tea party groups want			0
their lawsuit aims first to identify a list of ' all dissenting groups targeted for additional scrutiny by the @entity1 from january 20 , 2009 , through july 15 , 2013			2
' @entity9 could then choose to certify that list as a ' class ' of plaintiffs			0
@entity1 commissioner @entity95 has insisted that his agency is no longer targeting conservative groups with special scrutiny , and has offered to green - list any group that promises it will limit its political activity to 40 per cent of its budget – but some organizations are holdout out , claiming the law entitles them to a 50 per cent limit the @entity1 's lawyers claimed that they could n't provide the court with the names of all the groups , saying they would have to turn over the very documents that @entity114 requires them to keep confidential			1
the conservative plaintiffs said they would be happy to have only the spreadsheet that the inspector general got from the @entity1			0
@entity9 agreed and ordered the agency to hand it over			0
' the court concludes that the return information sought is directly related to the issue of class certification in this federal court proceeding , ' her ruling reads			0
' the names of the putative class member organizations and their control dates – the date which the putative class member organizations submitted their applications for tax exempt status to the @entity1 – are directly related to the issue of class certification			1
' @entity9 decided that without the list , the plaintiffs would n't be able to show all the disaffected conservative applicants it has already identified share common experiences at the hands of @entity10 's tax collectors			0
@entity141 first reported her ruling			0
the @entity1 is the federal agency @entity10 most love to hate , polling worse in opinion surveys than @entity144 a partial list was unearthed by @entity146 in september 2013 , showing that as of 2011 the @entity1 had questioned the political advocacy of 162 right - wing organizations and delayed approving their tax exemptions			1
in an @entity1 spreadsheet published online by the newspaper , partisan government officials characterized the activities of 21 of those groups as ' propaganda			0
' @entity9 also ordered the @entity1 to tell the court whether or not that list was authentic , the @entity157 reported			2
former @entity1 official @entity43 , who has been at the center of the targeting scandal since it emerged in 23 months ago , was facing the possibility of criminal contempt of @entity144 charges until the @entity166 administration 's @entity49 declined on monday to prosecute her			1
@entity43 , under subpoena in may 2013 , delivered an opening statement professing her innocence during a hearing but then refused to answer questions .			0

right - wing groups want court to let them sue the @entity1 in a class - action lawsuit for violating their *constitutional* right to equal *treatment*
@entity1 applied different *criteria* to right - wing groups , holding up their applications for years while liberal organizations *skated* through
@entity166 administration *fought* the release of a list of 298 groups it denied tax - exempt status beginning in 2010 , citing privacy concerns
judge in @entity193 *overruled* the government and ordered the @entity1 to hand over the list
if court ' certifies ' class - action status , the @entity198 groups will be free to demand emails , phone records and other documents
