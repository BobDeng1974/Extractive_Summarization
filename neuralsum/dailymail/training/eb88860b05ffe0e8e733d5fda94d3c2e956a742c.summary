he told @entity3 's state - run @entity38 news agency : ' children are curious about sex , so we wanted to explain it clearly in a cartoon			1
' a study released this year by @entity3 newspaper the @entity45 and charity the @entity47 found that fewer than one in five parents had told their children how to ask for help if they felt they were being victimised			0
the creators use metaphors to explain sex and compares insemination to a hospital injection the cartoons debunk myths , including a common one that babies come from garbage dumps , and explain how they originate from sperm and eggs the survey of 1,100 parents found that only one in three said they had told their children about ' private parts which no one else can touch '			2
of the 107 six to 14 - year - olds surveyed , 38 per cent showed complete ignorance about protecting their bodies			0

in @entity3 , a common reply to the question of where babies come from is they were ' picked up at a garbage dump '			0
the narrator in one clip explains this is not true but that babies are conceived by ' a combination of sperm and eggs '			0
