there are few coaches in world football who can boast a better c.v			0
than @entity5 but at the moment it looks like he is working from only one half of the coaching manual			1
as good as @entity10 looked going forward against @entity11 , they looked just as bad in defence			1
there is no balance to their play and they are too easy to exploit			0
@entity18 needs to fix these defensive frailties — and quickly			1
@entity20 ( left ) and @entity21 look dejected during @entity10 's defeat by @entity11 @entity5 wonders where it all went wrong after @entity10 threw away a two - goal lead against the foxes the weakness in @entity10 ’s defence was apparent throughout the match			1
@entity30 was the only non-defender not bombing forward the whole time			0
i felt really sorry for him : it was like he was on a boat with holes springing up everywhere and he was trying to empty out the water on his own with a small bucket			0
@entity10 just did n’t have enough players back and @entity40 in particular needs to learn to sit deeper			1
of the front players , @entity42 was the only one really tracking back , and that is unacceptable			2
@entity10 ’s multi-million forward line need to be the first line of defence			1
i admire the fact @entity18 is trying to stand by @entity10 ’s attacking traditions but look at how @entity50 and @entity51 set up — you have to occupy all parts of the pitch , not just charge forward in search of goals			1
that ’s why @entity58 played instead of @entity59 for @entity50 against @entity51 — he ’s less skilful but harder working and was terrific			0
@entity10 ’s back four lack leaders and this image above from @entity62 is a fine example			1
here , five @entity10 players are pointing to the two unmarked @entity11 players in the penalty area , seemingly asking each other to take responsibility and pick them up			1
they have no sort of straight defensive line either this shows @entity10 ’s dismal attempt at organising their back line			1
the players marked 1 ( @entity75 ) , 2 ( @entity76 ) , 3 ( @entity77 ) and 4 ( @entity78 ) are @entity10 ’s back four in the second half			1
but rather than standing in a straight line , looking to catch opponents offside , @entity10 ’s players have formed a diamond			1
it sums up the lack of shape , communication and organisation			0
@entity5 has a big job on his hands @entity30 ( left ) was left on his own in defence at times while @entity40 needs to learn to sit deep @entity42 ( centre ) was furious with his @entity10 defence as they capitulated at @entity11 @entity10 are worse off after @entity5 ’s first five league fixtures than they were at the same stage under @entity97 last season			1
12th at this point last season , @entity10 were eighth and five points off the lead			1
they are currently 12th , eight points behind table - topping @entity51			2
4 @entity103 's @entity10 never conceded more than four goals in a league game , and when they did ship four it was against eventual champions @entity50			1
it gets worse for @entity18 when you compare his fixtures to @entity97 ’s			1
the @entity112 faced @entity51 , @entity113 and @entity50 in his first five games			0
only @entity115 and @entity116 ( 8 ) have used more defenders than @entity10 ’s seven this season			2
and @entity18 ’s defenders have averaged the fewest minutes on the pitch			2
it is going to take a long time to erase the memory of the @entity11 defeat			0
teams now know there is a weakness to exploit and that if you get at @entity10 , they will crack			2
they used to have an aura , they used to find a way to win or get lucky			0
now , they are seen as being soft at the back			2
just when it looked like @entity10 had turned a corner , all the failings have come back to haunt them			1
@entity11 were superb and took advantage brilliantly but things have changed			0
in the past , one penalty being given against @entity10 was a miracle			2
on sunday , there were two			0
whatever @entity18 is telling his team it is clearly not sinking in			2
the @entity146 seems to have all the answers after each bad result , telling us why they lost and what went wrong			0
perhaps he should try coming up with solutions before games and equip his players better so they stop losing			0
he also needs to encourage the players to have a voice of their own , so they take responsibility on the pitch			0
players need to cross that white line and think , ‘ i ’m on the pitch , not you , and i ’m going to take charge ’			0
at the moment it seems @entity10 ’s players are just hearing @entity18 ’s voice as they play and not developing their own			1
i ’m sure he will turn things round because he is such a successful coach but sometimes from the players ’ perspective , less is more from your manager			0
one of @entity18 ’s biggest problems is the group of defenders he has to pick from			1
it is ludicrous that @entity10 allowed @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 — with a total of 1,134 appearances for the club — to all leave in the same summer			1
on top of that they have failed to bring in a dominant figure to replace these senior men , despite signing two left backs in @entity188 and @entity189			1
@entity190 peels away to celebrate after exposing @entity10 's defence to put @entity11 in front on sunday @entity193 fired home @entity11 's fifth goal from the penalty spot to rub salt into @entity10 's wounds @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 were all allowed to leave @entity199 over the summer an influential defender is vital for any team			1
from the back you can see the game unfold in front of you			2
you can cajole , you can demand a performance from your team - mates and you can encourage them			0
@entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 are just a few of the managers who built their teams from the back			0
instead , @entity10 have a naivety in defence			2
too often he ’s involved in goals @entity10 concede and too often he is unreliable			2
he has played 158 times for @entity10 so he ’s experienced but he needs to learn fast			2
@entity178 and @entity179 used to coach him through games			1
now he needs to be a senior member of the back four			0
he ’s not developing enough			0
when i was at @entity224 with all those great players in front of me weaving pretty patterns and scoring great goals , i felt that if i did n’t keep a clean sheet then i was on borrowed time			0
@entity10 ’s defence need that attitude			2
they need to defend their goal like i did , thinking their futures depend on it			0
@entity75 ( right ) was expected to be a long - term replacement for @entity178 and @entity179 in defence @entity188 ( left ) has struggled to make an impact while @entity189 's best position is not yet known the long - term replacements for @entity178 and @entity179 were supposed to be @entity75 and @entity241			1
but they were still second choice to the veteran defenders last season and they have not trained on			0
they perform like bit - part players , which is what they have been for a few years			0
they need to get a proper run in the team and be trusted because they can still be very good players			0
indeed @entity18 needs to choose his first - choice defence , and give the players time to develop together			1
does he rate @entity188 ? is @entity189 a left back or a centre back for him ? these questions need answering			1
there is a silver lining in the form of @entity76			1
yes , he was sent off and is learning the harsh realities of the @entity264			0
but he is strong with and without the ball , has a bit of nastiness about him — which i like — and has good pace and technical ability			0
he just needs to be stronger in the air and show his determination over 90 minutes , not just in flashes			0
facing @entity190 , who was a bit like @entity277 — annoying to play against but outstanding — was tough			0
@entity10 are buying big players as they battle to avoid years in the wilderness like @entity113 experienced			2
but you ca n’t buy a determination not to be beaten and there is n’t enough of that at @entity10 right now			2
@entity76 ( right ) has proved himself a valuable asset for @entity10 , despite being sent off on sunday like our @entity10 facebook page here .			1

@entity5 has answers after the game but needs solutions before
@entity10 boss needs to teach his gung - ho *galacticos* to defend
@entity18 needs to pick his best back four and stick with it
it is ludicrous that @entity178 , @entity180 and @entity179 all left
@entity75 and @entity241 have not trained on as their replacements
@entity18 needs to **decide** if he rates *£* *31million* signing @entity188
he also must **decide** which position is best for @entity189
*youngster* @entity76 has been a silver lining at the back , however
