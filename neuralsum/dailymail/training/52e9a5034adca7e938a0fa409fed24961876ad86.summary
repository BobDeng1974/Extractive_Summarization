by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 said he requested the forms to join assisted suicide clinic @entity5 after 14 painful back and leg operations @entity2 took steps to join assisted suicide clinic @entity5 , he revealed last night			1
the @entity11 composer was so convinced he wanted to die last summer that he requested forms for the the @entity14 clinic			1
he said a bout of deep depression , triggered by the pain from a series of operations , caused him to consider suicide			0
but the 66 - year - old , who previously suffered with prostate cancer , said he now felt it would have been a ‘ stupid and ridiculous ’ thing to do			1
the peer is likely to oppose the bill to legalise ‘ assisted dying ’ tabled by @entity27 , the former lord chancellor , which will be debated today			1
@entity2 , who said he struggled with the pain after 14 back and leg operations , told the @entity32 : ‘ i went through a moment of deep depression – that awful moment when you think that you must find a way out			1
‘ i actually got the forms for @entity5			0
with hindsight , it was stupid and ridiculous , but i could n’t think what to do			1
’ he said as his symptoms alleviated he decided to throw the forms away and expects to oppose the bill but remains torn on the issue			1
’ nearly 130 peers have signed up to speak in a 10 - hour debate , which will begin the biggest ever challenge to @entity65 ’s euthanasia laws			1
under the bill , doctors would be able to prescribe a lethal dose of drugs to patients in @entity71 and @entity72 with less than six moths to live			0
two doctors would have to confirm that the patient had the capacity to make an informed decision to die			0
one of the two doctors would then provide the drugs with which the patient would end their life			0
@entity2 also told the paper that he believed his mother @entity82 , a distinguished piano teacher , would have chosen to end her life had the law been in place while she was alive			1
he said that she expressed a wish to end her life , five years before she died peacefully in december 1993 , aged 72			0
but @entity2 believes his mother - who cycled and walked until her death - was not ready to die			1
he said he fears that ' in the future , someone like her could be assisted to die ' , before they are ready			2
@entity93 , former attorney general , said the assisted dying bill is flawed and said it could lead to ' a form of legalised execution ' he told the paper : ' she kept saying she could n't continue any more because she was a burden on us			2
' we told her she was anything but ... in the state she was in , i fear that a couple of doctors would have concluded that , if she wished to kill herself , they would agree			0
' the composer 's brief consideration to join @entity5 came after he underwent a procedure to ease a pain he developed in his leg , around two years ago			2
that , and a back operation , led to the composer having 14 operations , which propelled him into a state of depression			1
he said he would approach the debate with an open mind and listen to the arguments , but would also think about his mother and ' reflect on personal experience '			2
' with hindsight , it was stupid and ridiculous , but i could n’t think what to do ' @entity2 @entity93 , who was the government ’s chief law officer until the cabinet reshuffle this week , said the proposals could open the door to a form of ‘ legalised execution ’			2
the former attorney general , said : ‘ i think that the assisted dying bill is flawed and seeking to do something that could lead to a form of legalised execution , however well intended			0
‘ it is not something that a civilised society should do			0
’ @entity142 , the health secretary , also said he believed the proposals would ' devalue ' the lives of people living with disabilities			0
this week , a group of 27 leading doctors urged the @entity150 to support the bill , saying terminally ill people suffering ‘ unendurably ’ should be allowed to end their lives			2
it came as leaders from @entity65 's major faiths - the @entity157 , the @entity158 and the @entity160 faith - put their names to a joint letter which pleaded with @entity163 not to legalise assisted dying			0
the letter , signed by 23 leaders , including archbishop of canterbury @entity167 , said it would be a ' grave error ' which could change society forever .			0
