archaeologists have uncovered what is believed to be the only inscribed tomb and matching remains ever found from @entity4			1
the discovery of the limestone tombstone and skull was found while excavating a car park in @entity9 and they are believed to date back to between the 1st and 3rd centuries			1
and based on inscriptions the grave is believed to have belonged to a 27 - year - old female called @entity15			1
archaeologists have uncovered what is believed to be the only inscribed tomb and matching remains ever found from @entity4			1
the inscription on the stone reads : ' @entity21 , in the hands of @entity23 ] , @entity15 , the wife lived years : 27 ' and it was found under a car park in @entity9 despite the similar name , it is unlikely to be @entity15 because her @entity29 tribe was centred further east in @entity30 and she was said to be have been in her 30s when she died			1
the experts said it is also rare to find a stone with such an ornate inscription in the @entity35			1
archaeologists from @entity37 are excavating the former @entity39 site on @entity40 in @entity9 ahead of planned building work in the area			1
the location would have been known as @entity44 at the time of the burial and it was the second largest town in @entity4			1
according to the archaeologists , the inscription on the stone reads : ' @entity21 , in the hands of @entity23 ] , @entity15 , the wife lived years : 27			1
' however , an alternative translation is that @entity51 is plural ( ' to @entity52 ' ) , whereas the singular would be @entity54 ; and ' of @entity23 ' would be @entity55			0
secondly , @entity57 is said to be be related to the word @entity58 ' , but is from @entity59 , deities thought to represent the souls of the departed			0
the alternative translation is therefore : ' for the @entity59 gods ' or ' to the @entity59 gods '			0
the abbreviation @entity65 , although related to @entity67 religion was also used on early @entity69 tombstones			1
archaeologist @entity70 said : ' as an archaeologist , i always get asked what is the best thing i have ever found ; well now i have the answer to that			2
the 4ft - tall ( 1.2 metre ) and 2ft - wide ( 0.6 metre ) tomb was first spotted on tuesday night			0
it was lying face down and its ornate triangle - shaped top suggested to the team that it may be a tombstone			1
when they lifted it from the ground they found it resting on an adult skull ( pictured ) said to be the person inscribed on the stone the stone is thought to date from between the 1st and 3rd centuries and has roman letters and lines of @entity94			1
archaeologist @entity70 said he believes it is the only example in @entity4 of a tombstone that has someone 's name on it with their remains underneath ' we think it is the only example in @entity4 of a tombstone that has someone 's name on it , and then their remains underneath			2
' we think this because it seems to have fallen on top of their body			0
the stone was on top of the skull			0
this is a really , really rare discovery			0
' when we lifted it out , you could have cut the atmosphere with a knife			0

the location would have been known as @entity44 at the time of the burial and it was the second largest town in @entity4 the team were called in to investigate the area ahead of work to build a new office block by a wealth management company just after @entity135			1
they previously uncovered 75 burial sites , as well as a bronze cockerel being cradled by a young boy at the site in 2011 , and think the plot was a burial ground for the @entity67 elite of @entity9			1

the child was buried wearing hobnailed shoes and was accompanied by a pottery feeding vessel , and the remarkable enamelled bronze figurine of a cockerel			2
the cockerel is 5 - inches tall ( 12.5cm ) and the breast , wings , eyes and ‘ comb ’ are inlaid with enamel , which now appears blue and green			2
there is a separately moulded tail plate , also enamelled , with ‘ openwork ’ decoration			0
the beak is shown open , in the act of crowing			0
it is believed that the @entity181 gave religious significance to the cockerel which was known to be connected with @entity184			0
experts claim it was @entity184 , a messenger to the gods , that was also responsible for conducting newly - deceased souls to the afterlife			2
statues of this god , including one in the @entity193 , commonly show a cockerel at the base			0
the association probably stems from @entity184 ’s role as the messenger to the gods and that of the cockerel as ‘ announcer ’ of the new dawn			0
@entity184 was also the ‘ herdsman for the dead ’ , guiding newly deceased souls on their passage to the afterlife			0
it is therefore possible that the cockerel was an offering by a devotee of @entity184 and expresses a parent ’s particular concern to ensure safe transit of a loved one into the after world			0
the bronze and enamel cockerel ( pictured ) was said to have been placed in the grave of the two - year - old @entity67 girl by her parents , and experts believe it was used to ask the @entity52 to protect her			1
they also believe the expensive gift was placed in the grave to ease their daughter 's transition into the ' next world ' when they lifted it from the ground they discovered it was resting on an adult skull though to be the woman inscribed on the stone			2
around 100 tombstones have been found from @entity4 but this is the best preserved and is the only one thought to mark the person found beneath			2
mr @entity70 added : ' we saw the back of the tombstone , but we did n't know of the significance			0
' we thought it was something , because of the shape of it , but we could n't be sure			0
experts said the stone is lucky to have survived because @entity4 tombstones were often taken away and re-purposed in buildings during the @entity252 period			2
a garage was also built on the site ( excavation plans shown ) in the 1960s and the stone survived being destroyed by a beam laid during construction ' but [ wednesday ] was the amazing moment - that 's when we knew it really was something , but it surpassed all our expectations			2
' we have the potential to be uncovering one of the biggest finds of archaeology this year			0
' the stone is thought to date from between the 1st and 3rd centuries and has roman letters and lines of @entity94			0
the team said it is lucky to have survived intact because @entity67 tombstones were often taken away and re-purposed in buildings in @entity9 during the the @entity252 period			1
a garage was also built on the site in the 1960s and the stone survived being destroyed by a beam which was laid during construction just a few inches above			0
' this stone might have fallen over quite quickly , and was covered over , and that 's why it escaped the stone robbers , ' mr @entity70 added			0
the tombstone and the remains will now be taken away to be analysed and dated by experts			1
experts believe the bones belong to a woman called @entity15 who died in @entity67 times the skeleton was found close to a @entity67 tombstone in @entity9 , @entity293 and is unique the @entity94 inscription reads ' in the hands of @entity23 , @entity15 , the wife lived years : 27 ' the bones are thought to be 1,800 years old but will be taken away for further examination the tombstone , pictured , is believed to have been made from @entity301 limestone experts very excited by the intricate carving on the tombstone which is highly unusual the remains were discovered during the excavation of a car park in @entity9 , @entity293 experts believe that it is highly unlikely that the grave site is that of @entity15 @entity15			1
