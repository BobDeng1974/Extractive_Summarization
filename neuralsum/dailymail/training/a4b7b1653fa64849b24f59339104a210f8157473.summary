the location is @entity1 in @entity2			0
it ’s 2007 and @entity4 are in this hotel because they are competing in the @entity7			1
one in which they will cruise to the final , start as favourites but be whipped by @entity12			0
from the macro to the micro			0
we are in @entity17 room and it ’s already well past midnight			2
it ’s a sizeable ‘ habitación ’ and the bed has been moved			0
anyone next door or in the floor below can forget sleep — but not because of loud rock and roll , not because of a telly being thrown out of the window , nor because the lads have snuck co-eds into the room			0
@entity32 scores @entity34 's second goal in their 3 - 0 winner over @entity36 on saturday @entity32 ( right ) celebrates his goal which capped another impressive display from the @entity39 @entity32 avoids the challenge of @entity36 's @entity41 during saturday 's @entity43 clash @entity17 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity32 are playing two - a - side foot - volley using the bed in the middle of the room as a net and the competition is not only fierce it ’ll go on for hours yet			1
interestingly @entity17 , then very much the @entity52 of that entire squad , chose @entity32 as his playing partner , not the infinitely gifted @entity44			1
‘ it ’s a memory i ’ll never forget , ’ @entity17 now admits			2
‘ beyond his technical ability , @entity32 possesses the mentality of a champion			2
‘ he ’ll stand back up again every time you try to knock him down			0
’ which is probably no bad thing			0
since 2007 , @entity32 has racked up trophies , just like @entity44			2
but the latter has gone on to dominate the football world , or at least do galactic battle with @entity66 , while @entity32 ’s 11 trophies have not gained him the same respect or adoration			2
in fact , he has been mired in controversy and opprobrium			0
during the week he made his return to the @entity4 squad — from which his country ’s media largely think he has been excluded because of bad feeling between him and @entity44			1
perhaps a disputed point in room 427 in @entity1			0
perhaps some more of football ’s ‘ this town ai n’t big enough for the both of us ’			0
@entity32 waves to fans as he takes his place on the bench for @entity4 at former club @entity89 @entity32 shoots at goal during @entity4 's 2 - 1 victory over @entity92 at @entity93 last week @entity32 made his return to the national team for the first time in three years the fact remains that @entity32 finds himself at @entity34 because @entity98 did n’t rate him sufficiently highly to pay a fee which is still disputed ( figures range from £ 30 - 40million ) and because he then fell out spectacularly with @entity101 at @entity102			1
by the way , january 6 , 2015 , is the date for those of you who like schadenfreude — @entity34 ( @entity32 ) v @entity108 ( @entity101 ) in @entity109			1
book now to avoid disappointment			0
@entity34 are in position to win their fourth consecutive @entity113 but , for one reason or another , their return to national dominance has n’t seen a rise in their competitive ability in @entity121 terms			1
new coach @entity135 admits : ‘ when i took over , president @entity122 told me something which impacted			0
he said : “ it ’s impossible to win every year but we must be in contention for everything when march comes around "			2
we need to think as little as possible about the fact that this is our chance to win four @entity130 on the bounce and concentrate on our primary objective which is to ensure that we get through the @entity134 group stage			1
' winning the @entity134 this year seems a big ask , although on paper this is a squad which , if it was fully firing , should theoretically ask questions of any team			1
@entity34 captain @entity139 ( centre ) holds @entity134 trophy after victory over @entity143 in 1996 @entity101 and @entity32 ( right ) celebrate winning the @entity144 in 2012 @entity32 and @entity101 fell out and it led to the striker leaving @entity102 for @entity34 @entity32 and his @entity98 team - mates celebrate winning the @entity144 in 2009 but the drive is to be properly @entity149 - muscular in time to lift the @entity150 with the big ears 20 years on from the last time ( in 1996 ) and the question is : exactly where are they ? to begin with they are in @entity156 this week , facing @entity157 in a @entity159 position where — while a defeat wo n’t eliminate them — a win seems vital to their progress			1
step forward @entity32 ? @entity17 says : ‘ he ’s playing the best football of his life and in this club he seems to have found a new @entity168 ( the club to which @entity169 swears undying allegiance )			1
i can see it in his eyes			0
’ all fine and dandy			0
but as he showed two weeks ago in the 7 - 0 demolition of @entity176 with a brace , one of which was both messi-esque and utterly sublime , @entity32 needs to be @entity34 ’s ‘ extra ’ element			1
thus far in all his @entity121 competition experience , at @entity89 , @entity98 , @entity102 and @entity34 he has managed a measly nine goals in 53 appearances			2
for the @entity34 of @entity185 football it needs to be @entity186 time			1

@entity17 says @entity32 is in form of his life for @entity34
@entity32 's form saw him recalled to @entity4 squad last week
@entity34 on course to win fourth straight @entity185 title but club are still *struggling* to make mark in @entity134
@entity32 scored in @entity34 ' 3 - 0 win over @entity36 on saturday
