shocks in tennis do not come any more earth - shattering than this			1
somehow the impossible came true and @entity9 ’s @entity8 came tumbling down			2
not since he won the first of his seven @entity13 titles in 2003 had the @entity14 lost in the first week of @entity13			1
@entity15 , he had n’t even lost before the quarter - finals			1
he did so last night and the manner of it was a @entity13 throwback to the lost age of serve and volley			1
@entity3 did n’t just rewrite the history books , he ripped up the modern manual of how to play grass - court tennis			1
demonically charging to the net at every opportunity , the world no 116 punched away volleys for three hours , even when @entity9 flayed shots in anger straight at him			2
the ball flew long , but @entity9 ’s steamy glare across the net lingered			2
the 17 - times @entity54 champion rarely demonstrates such antipathy			1
for once , he was n’t in charge on the court which is so often his serene domain			2
@entity60 enveloped the old arena , sweeping away even former champions @entity62 and @entity64 in the @entity66 commentary box			2
‘ you wo n’t believe what i just witnessed ’ said @entity62			0
‘ i ’ve got goosebumps , i know @entity64 does , because that was just old school			0
you hear people say you ca n’t do this any more , you ca n’t serve and volley , the courts are too slow			1
’ @entity3 was cheered on to the triumph that will define his journeyman career by @entity77 , his wife of 21 months			0
in action : @entity9 was another high - profile casualty of @entity13 after @entity81 's exit throwing in the towel ? @entity9 takes a breather between games before his shock @entity13 exit for much of his married life , he has changed tennis from the inside of an @entity91 meeting room			1
the most dramatic change they have influenced during that time has been the increase in prizemoney at @entity54 for first - and second - round losers			1
that was supposed to help players like the 27 - year - old himself			1
the deepest irony is that it is @entity9 who will be the beneficiary , even if the £ 38,000 cheque is no more than loose change to him			0
‘ i ’m in the @entity91 because i think i can change things , ’ said @entity3			0
‘ on the court , i ’m outside the top 100 because there are 100 guys better than me			0
‘ the revival of serve and volley is not up to me			0
it ’s about the tournaments and the surface			0
there is hardly a surface left on which you can serve and volley successfully			0
’ praying : @entity3 's wife @entity77 clutches her hands in hope during the final throes of the intense battle on court , @entity3 created a stir at the recent @entity125			1
having had a point awarded against him in his first - round loss to @entity128 , he marched to his tennis bag , grabbed his phone and took a photo of the mark left on the red clay			1
when he later tweeted the photo , he earned himself a fine of 1,500 euros			0
@entity3 advances to a third - round meeting tomorrow with @entity137			1
the only certainty is that he will not match the magnificence of his performance			2
it is usually @entity9 who takes the breath away from the @entity8 crowd , ripping the heart out of his opponents in the process with the majesty of his play			2
true enough , even while wearing the white - soled tennis shoes by decree of the @entity153 after transgressing in the first round , there were moments of brilliance which drew a standing ovation			1
crucially , they did not deflect @entity3 from his quest			0
even when he conceded a first - set tiebreak , the @entity42 continued to rush the net at every opportunity			2
his approach shots were penetratingly deep , his movement sharp and his volleys crisply punched away			0
a wistful glance : @entity9 departs @entity8 after his surprise defeat to the outstanding @entity3 , who celebrates below in the second - set tiebreak it was @entity9 who blinked , shanking a forehand so badly that the ball ballooned over the baseline to give @entity3 set point			1
the firmest of volleys converted it			0
a roar went up but , in truth , the @entity8 crowd believed it was merely a blip on the usual procession			0
the @entity14 would simply raise his level and skate away to victory			0
at 5 - 5 and after 34 games without a service break , it was @entity3 who lifted his play and @entity9 who wobbled , pushing a forehand inexplicably long			1
that third set was secured with a superbly angled volley , the fourth set saved with a deliciously controlled volley which plopped on to the @entity8 turf and died			0
another prayer : but these fans and their banner did n't get their wish historic : @entity9 last failed to reach a @entity54 quarter - final in 2004 , in a @entity125 loss to @entity204 even in the tiebreak , no one truly believed in the miracle that was unfolding — except @entity3			1
that was until , at match point down , @entity9 pushed a backhand wide , ending an era which will surely never be replicated			2
@entity3 tipped an imaginary hat to the enraptured @entity8 crowd , @entity9 simply scratched his head			0
unsure of the right etiquette , the @entity14 departed			0
@entity3 halted his celebrations and joined in the applause , suddenly aware of what he had done			0
he will almost certainly never win @entity13 but @entity3 , too , will now never be forgotten .			1
