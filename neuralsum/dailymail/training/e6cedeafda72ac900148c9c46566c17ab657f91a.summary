by @entity0 to new overseas signings , @entity1 is simply the @entity3 kit man			1
the 73 - year - old club servant who recycles the training gear and lays down their jerseys			1
it takes time for the penny to drop			2
to realise that the grey - haired , diminutive old @entity10 servicing their needs is a living , breathing @entity15 icon			1
a survivor of the club ’s greatest - ever triumph and their longest - serving employee since @entity20			1
those who doubt it are pointed to a picture of the day 47 years ago this month when @entity3 became champions of @entity25			1
icon : @entity27 @entity1 remains a loyal servant to @entity3 at the age of 73 ‘ i do n’t go about telling them who i am , ’ says the modest @entity1 , @entity30 ’ s former partner in central defence			1
‘ but i think the players spread the word			2
‘ they will come up and ask if it ’s true			2
if they are down in my room i just show them the photograph			2
‘ i ’ll say to them : “ there ’s been big changes since then , but take a look at that			2
the thing in the middle with the big handles is the thing you ’ll always want to win			1
’ ” the @entity52 are old and grey now			2
some , such as @entity54 , @entity55 , keeper @entity56 and striker @entity57 are no longer with us			2
but their former team - mates will raise a glass to absent friends when the @entity52 return to @entity63 for what could be the final time this weekend			1
they became champions of @entity25 with 11 players drawn from within a 30 - mile radius of @entity69			2
it ’s a fact repeated many times , yet still seems mildly incredible in an era of multi-cultural football teams			2
history : @entity1 and some of his former team - mates will return to @entity63 ahead of the @entity78 final ‘ these days the language can be a difficulty at times , ' @entity1 admits			1
‘ you can walk into a dressing room and there will be two or three foreign lads all talking a different language			0
‘ you do n’t know what they are talking about			0
you just do n’t like to think they are talking about you			0
‘ but there has always been a good camaraderie at @entity3			1
they have always mixed in quite quickly			0
’ even so , the @entity52 had something special			0
there is always the danger of tales from the 2 - 1 win over @entity101 being told so often they become stale			1
such is the plight of the @entity104 game now , however , that they actually become more remarkable with the passing of time			0
to mark the first @entity78 final held in @entity63 since that thursday afternoon in 1967 , they will come together to relive them in the @entity112 capital this weekend			1
what makes the trip so poignant is the possibility it might well be their final visit as a group to the city where they made their name			0
‘ everyone is getting on a wee bit , ’ @entity1 concedes , ‘ but we all still get on			1
’ close - knit : @entity30 and @entity124 during a minute 's silence for former team - mate @entity54 in 2006 amongst @entity3 supporters , they enjoy the status of gods			1
yet they remain accessible , approachable and humble			0
they earned more than the average working man in 1967 , but not by much			2
the idea of @entity1 doing a @entity134 and throwing a strop over a birthday cake is mildly ludicrous			1
‘ the modern - day players do n’t bother too much about what we did , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ they do n’t think about anyone else much			0
‘ we just looked at the wage slip and that was it			0
it ’s different now , but players are still players			0
’ together with @entity148 and @entity149 , @entity1 retains the sharpest memory for detail amongst the @entity52			1
‘ i can remember all the players we came up against			0
the @entity155 captain played at @entity156			0
was it @entity158 ? ‘ one of the best goalkeepers i ever saw was @entity160 of @entity161			0
and then we played @entity101 and they had @entity162 and such like			0
you do n’t get those names these days , do you ? ’ mystery : @entity1 has described current @entity3 manager @entity166 as both good and bad the @entity167 and @entity168 of this world are hardly footballing pygmies in comparison			1
and , on a memorable night two years ago , @entity3 notched a notable win over the giants of @entity174			1
however , when asked if the @entity104 champions will ever match these clubs again , @entity1 is dubious			1
the financial gulf is now an unbridgeable chasm			0
‘ @entity174 , @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 – the cash they all have is amazing			0
it ’ll be really difficult to win a @entity78 again			1
‘ you have it in your mind that you ’d love to do it , but you never know			0
the way finance is in @entity104 football we ’re up against it			0
the last 16 is an achievement now			0
’ @entity1 , who was @entity3 ’s assistant manager under @entity30 in the early 80s , tends to keep his thoughts on football matters to himself these days			1
asked his views on current boss @entity166 , he grins : ‘ @entity198 – he ’s good and bad is n’t he ? ‘ he ’s done quite well in his short time in management			2
the club wants to be in the @entity78 every year and he ’s done that			1
‘ the more experience he gets the better he will be for it – i wo n’t tell you the bad things			0
i ’ll keep them to myself			0
‘ if he asks me my view i ’ll say something in the passing			0
it was the same with @entity211 and @entity212			0
occasionally they may ask you things in the passing - but not much			2
’ knowing when to keep quiet has served @entity1 well during 40 - odd years over three spells at @entity3			1
most of all under the formidable @entity218 , the man who will no doubt dominate the conversation yet again in @entity63 this weekend			2
‘ our gaffer was the @entity222 man , ’ @entity1 recalls			1
‘ if he said you could speak to the press , you spoke to the press			0
‘ if he did n’t and you did it anyway , you ’d have a hard time			0
especially from his left foot … ’ @entity229 : @entity218 managed @entity3 to their only @entity78 win in 1967 , beating @entity101 2 - 1			1

@entity3 kit man @entity1 enjoying life 47 years on from @entity78 win
@entity27 flying out to @entity112 with *ex-team* - mates
enjoys status as icon among current @entity3 squad when identity is *revealed*
has seen a lot change at @entity3 during his long *association* with the club
