by @entity0 published : 12:40 est , 23 april 2013 updated : 07:50 est , 24 april 2013 finding the perfect man usually involves dates galore , the odd disappointment and the patience of a saint			0
but @entity7 designer , @entity6 , has come up with a simpler solution			0
for those in need of someone to cuddle up to , she has invented ' @entity12 ' , a boyfriend shaped pillow			2
along with @entity12 , there 's also a ' @entity16 ' and , when stuffed , both are big , warm , cuddly and guaranteed to get along with friends , family and pets			1
' i created @entity12 for the same reason i created the accessories : we do not all have the same taste in men , ' explains @entity25			2
' by making @entity16 and @entity12 , i made an example of how you can easily choose your own kind of man in the production process - a different colour yarn already makes a huge difference ! ' the artist and designer is also creating a book featuring illustrations of all all the different things you can do with your man substitute , which include proving an embrace whenever you need it			2
the woolly suits can be worn by real living men too , if the owner desires , but they do n't come with any good behavior guarantees			0
' i 'm still busy developing this project and creating a book with all my drawings about my knitted boyfriend , that will hopefully will be for sale in autumn , ' says @entity25			1
' this project is more about the story around my knitted boyfriend to me			1
i do n't have serious ambitions to stop making people feel lonely ( this is something everyone needs to do for themselves )			0
' i just try to bring out a smile or offer a feeling of recognition in order to start a conversation			0
' realistic : cuddling up to @entity12 and @entity16 looks even more comfortable than snuggling with a real man companion : the idea for @entity16 and @entity12 came around after @entity25 decided she needed a man in her life low maintenance : all @entity16 and @entity12 need to stay happy is regular washing and plenty of cuddles according to @entity25 , the idea for the knitted boyfriend came about when she decided that she needed a man in her life			1
' i could say that 's a joke , ' de @entity6 revealed to art website @entity103 , ' but it is partly true			0
' the result was @entity12 and @entity16 , who were designed to be the perfect male companions , guaranteed not to do things like leave their pants on the bathroom floor , criticise your outfit or , horror of horrors , dump you			1
but for those desperate to get their hands on a knitted boyfriend of their own , waiting is still the name of the game as , reveals @entity25 , @entity16 and @entity12 are prototypes			1
' my knitted boyfriend is not yet in production and remains a hand - and custom made product , ' she explains			2
' it 's always possible to have one made especially for you , but comes with a price of an exclusive hand made product			0
' those who already have an other half , can buy a my @entity126 print from @entity25 's website , which is topped with the sweet slogan : ' you are the best design i know '			0
for more information on my knitted boyfriend , see @entity141 snuggle : @entity6 cuddles up to @entity12 , who as well as being warm , is guaranteed not to snore romantic dinner : ' @entity12 ' can even have dinner with you , although the conversation might not be up to much			1

@entity6 is behind the ' my knitted boyfriend ' project
' @entity12 ' and ' @entity16 ' can be personalised with knitted accessories
designed to be the ideal male companion for cuddles and company
