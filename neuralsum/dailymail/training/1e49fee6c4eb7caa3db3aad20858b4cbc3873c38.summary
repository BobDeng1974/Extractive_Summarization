by @entity0 like many identical twins , @entity1 and @entity2 have done everything in sync – from ballet lessons to beating chickenpox			1
so when @entity1 decided to have cosmetic surgery on her nose 17 years ago , @entity2 followed suit			1
and since then , the 38 - year - olds have spent £ 70,000 on a host of cosmetic surgeries – all carried out at the same time by the same doctors – to ensure they can not be told apart			1
identical twins @entity1 ( left ) and @entity2 from @entity16 who have spent over £ 70,000 on plastic surgery between them they have had two breast enlargements , identical nose jobs , eye - lifts , tattooed eyeliner , facials , spray tans , manicures and pedicures			1
twice a year they even have @entity28 together – at the same time , naturally , so they age at the same rate			2
their most recent operation was in january when they underwent another breast enlargement , going from a @entity36 cup to an e on the same day			2
their identical surgeries began when the women , who live within five minutes of one another in @entity16 , @entity42 , were just 21			1
@entity2 , who is the eldest by 15 minutes and mother to @entity44 , six , and @entity45 , three , recalled : ‘ @entity1 said she ’d like a curve in her nose			1
i agreed that our noses were very straight and it seemed natural to go under the knife together			0
’ and strangely enough , the operations , which cost £ 2,500 each , both went wrong			2
‘ the tip of @entity1 ’s nose turned one way and mine went the other , ’ said @entity2			1
so a year later they had joint corrective surgery			0
however the experience did n’t put them off			0
in 2004 , they both got a breast augmentation costing £ 4,500 each , to go from a @entity64 to a @entity65			1
they have had two breast enlargements , identical nose jobs , eye - lifts , tattooed eyeliner , facials , spray tans , manicures and pedicures @entity1 , who lives with partner @entity75 , 46 , and is a full - time mother to @entity77 , 12 , and @entity78 , ten months , said : ‘ the surgeon even scribbled our initials on our stomachs so he did n’t get muddled up			1
’ by the age of 26 , the twins were having regular botox and facials			0
‘ always at the same time , ’ says @entity1 , ‘ so we age the same way			1
’ in 2009 , at a cost of £ 300 each , they had eyeliner tattooed on their eyelids , following eye - lifts totalling £ 6,000			1
once again it was @entity1 ’s idea			1
she said : ‘ i noticed a few crow ’s feet appearing around my eyes and thought about an eye lift			0
@entity2 agreed and we were delighted with the result			1
’ after discovering their implants were faulty @entity104 ones , they replaced them in january this year and went up to an e cup			0
the operations cost £ 3,000 each			0
@entity2 : ' we did ballet together and even beat chickenpox together			2
as toddlers we spoke in our own language that only we could understand ' they said their close bond came as no surprise to their parents @entity114 – who had no idea they were expecting two babies until four weeks before they were born			0
@entity2 weighed 6lb 13oz and @entity1 was 7lb 2oz			1
@entity2 said : ‘ @entity119 did her very best to ensure she could quickly tell us apart			2
@entity1 was always dressed in blue and i was in pink			2
but even as children we wanted to do everything together			0
‘ we did ballet together and even beat chickenpox together			0
‘ as toddlers we spoke in our own language that only we could understand			0
then at school we ’d often swap places			0
‘ i did n’t like cookery and , as a result , i was hardly ever there			0
’ they said that as they grow older , they would consider a facelift			0
however , @entity1 added : ‘ it would have to be joint surgery			2
‘ we ’d never have anything done without the other			0

38 - year - olds have spent £ 70,000 on a host of cosmetic surgeries
