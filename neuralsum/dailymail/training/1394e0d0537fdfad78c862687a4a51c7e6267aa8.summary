communities secretary @entity1 indirectly but ' unlawfully discriminated ' against gipsies , the @entity0 has ruled communities secretary @entity1 ' unlawfully discriminated ' against gipsies by using his ministerial powers to personally decide whether they should be allowed to settle on green belt land , the @entity0 has ruled			2
in a ruling likely to affect many other travellers , a judge found both human rights and equality laws were breached by mr @entity1 and his department for ' calling in ' cases which would normally be considered by his planning inspectors			1
mr @entity15 , sitting in @entity14 , said mr @entity1 was operating a legally flawed policy of ' recovering ' for his own consideration appeals by travellers who claim there are exceptional circumstances for allowing them @entity22 sites			1
the judge said an inspectors ' decision was normally received within eight weeks of the end of an inquiry - but it could take six months or more for a decision letter for a called - in case			0
no attempt had been made by mr @entity1 and his ministers to follow steps required by the @entity35 to avoid indirect discrimination , and ' substantial delays ' had occurred in dealing with the appeals in violation of @entity40 , said the judge			1
his test - case ruling was a victory for two @entity45 gipsies - @entity46 , a single mother with three children who is under threat of eviction from a site at @entity52 in the @entity14 borough of @entity54 , and @entity55 , a disabled woman also with three children fighting to live temporarily on @entity22 land at @entity58 near @entity59 , @entity60			0
both women wanted to live with their children in caravans on their own green belt land but were refused planning permission by their local councils			0
their subsequent appeals were automatically referred to mr @entity1 under the 2013 ' calling in ' policy , which meant any appeals over planning decisions relating to traveller sites in the green belt were automatically referred to the secretary of state			1
the judge found mr @entity1 had breached the @entity75 by indirectly discriminating against gipsies and travellers through this policy			1

gipsy and traveller leaders have condemned mr @entity1 ' ' calling in ' policy which they argue enabled him to overturn recommendations to allow site planning appeals the judge said mr @entity1 ' department had ' coined and developed ' a practice in 2013 - 2014 of calling in all , and then a majority , of @entity22 traveller cases - most involving @entity45 gypsies or @entity95 travellers - ' which discriminated unlawfully against a racial group '			1
he was also found to have breached @entity40 by delaying the women 's right to justice			2
he ruled that the @entity46 and @entity55 cases were two such ' unlawful recoveries ' and quashed them			0
planning minister @entity101 ( pictured ) said : ' this government makes no apologies for seeking to safeguard @entity22 protection and trying to bring a sense of fair play to the planning system ' planning minister @entity101 said : ' this government makes no apologies for seeking to safeguard @entity22 protection and trying to bring a sense of fair play to the planning system			0
' the government 's planning policy is clear that both temporary and permanent traveller sites are inappropriate development in the @entity22			2
today 's judgment does not question that principle			0
' but the @entity119 , which supported the gipsies challenge after becoming concerned that the ' call in ' policy may be unfair , welcomed the judge 's finding of indirect discrimination			1
an @entity119 spokesman said : ' we have a duty to protect everyone from discrimination and ensure that the law is applied fairly , consistently and equally for all			0
' we understand the need to be sensitive about @entity22 development but this should not be used to single out individuals for unlawful discrimination			0
' planning decisions should be taken on the merits of an application , not the characteristics of the applicant			2
' gipsy and traveller leaders have condemned mr @entity1 ' policy which , they argue , has enabled him to predominantly overturn recommendations to allow site planning appeals			1
they say local councils have consistently failed to earmark land for potential sites in local plans , and many gipsy travellers have bought land , including in the @entity22 , to develop sites for themselves			0
the @entity154 , which brought the case on behalf of the two women , told @entity157 the implications of the judgement were ' enormous ' and that around 100 gipsy and traveller planning appeals which were overseen personally by mr @entity1 since july 2013 could now be challenged in the courts .			1
