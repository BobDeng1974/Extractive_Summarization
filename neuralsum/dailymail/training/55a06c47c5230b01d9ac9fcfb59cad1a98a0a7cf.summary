@entity4 's failure to prosecute @entity6 pirates who attack ships , seize hostages and demand huge ransoms ‘ beggars belief ’ , a withering @entity1 report said today			2
nine out of ten piracy suspects detained by the @entity12 and other maritime forces in the @entity14 or @entity15 are released without trial , according to the @entity17			1
not one pirate has been brought to the @entity4 for prosecution , even though 20 other countries - including the @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 - had placed nearly 1,000 suspects on trial			1
flashpoint : the 17,000 - ton cargo ship @entity28 , when it was operating under the name @entity30 , was ferrying much - needed food supplies to @entity32 and @entity6 when it was attacked by pirates most of the time armed bandits who prey on merchant ships off the volatile @entity36 are returned to their boats and freed			2
ministers claim it is difficult to gather suitable evidence because pirates often threw weapons and other equipment into the sea when spotted by anti-piracy patrols			2
but the committee said the @entity12 should use photographs or video recordings to build a case against armed pirates			1
the report , published today said : ‘ gathering evidence to secure a successful prosecution for piracy is challenging			1
‘ however , not all claims made by the government about the difficulty in securing evidence were wholly convincing : when pirates are observed in boats with guns , ladders and even hostages , it beggars belief that they can not be prosecuted			2
‘ simply returning suspected pirates to their boats or to land , while it may temporarily disrupt their activities , provides little long term deterrence and has demonstrably failed to prevent an annual increases in both the number of pirates going to sea and in the number of attacks			2
’ mps on the cross-party committee launched their probe into piracy off the coast of @entity83 after a @entity4 couple were kidnapped by @entity6 pirates			1
@entity86 and @entity87 , originally from @entity88 but now living in @entity89 , were seized from their yacht @entity91 near the @entity92 in 2009 and held in @entity6 for a year , and released only after a ransom of up to £ 620,000 was reportedly paid			1
hostage : @entity86 and @entity87 , who were kidnapped by @entity6 pirates in october 2009 seven of the pirates who allegedly held them hostage are currently being tried in @entity98 for an attack on a @entity22 ship , and could then be extradited for trial in the @entity4			1
but despite the @entity103 possessing ‘ ample ’ evidence the @entity4 government is still ‘ negotiating jurisdiction ’ , the report says			2
the failure to prosecute pirates drew stinging criticism from seafaring organisations			0
the @entity111 - based @entity113 trade association told the committee : ‘ the repeated images of pirates being released without trial by naval forces , including the @entity12 , causes understandable derision			1
’ and the @entity120 , another maritime association based in @entity111 , said : ‘ the @entity4 has gained a degree of notoriety within the international shipping community for its failure to prosecute those caught red - handed in the act of piracy			1
‘ once captured , pirates caught by @entity4 forces are widely perceived simply to receive sustenance and medical assistance before being returned to the mainland unmolested			1
’ unacceptable : @entity133 , pictured says failure to put pirates in the dock must be addressed the government said the @entity12 had transferred 28 pirates to other countries , including @entity98 and the @entity92 , for prosecution since 2009			1
it had released 60 suspects held during boarding operations between april 2010 and november 2011			1
the 72 - page report said the ‘ plague ’ of piracy was a ‘ major concern ’ that threatened the @entity4 ’s economy and security			1
the number of @entity6 pirate attacks has soared from 55 in 2007 to 219 in 2010			0
in that period some 3,500 seafarers have been held hostage , with 62 killed			0
and between january and march last year ( 2011 ) there was an all - time high 97 attacks by pirates against merchant ships - more than 1 a day			0
experts estimate there are 3,000 pirates operating from war - torn @entity6 who attack commercial vessels from small skiffs or larger ‘ motherships ’ using @entity166 automatic rifles and rocket - propelled grenades			0
last year ransom payments hit a record $ 135million ( £ 86.5million ) in 2011			0
the global cost of piracy is as much as $ 12billion ( £ 7.5billion )			1
up to 200 vessels flying the red ensign - the @entity4 merchant navy flag - regularly sail close to @entity6			0
in october , prime minister @entity175 announced that @entity4 would lift the ban on armed guards being deployed on its merchant fleet			0
branding piracy a ‘ stain on our world ’ , he said security guards would have permission to ‘ shoot to kill ’ pirates attacking vessels for their valuable cargos and crews			2
the @entity17 welcomed the move but urged the government to clarify when it is legal for @entity4 - flagged ships to shoot dead @entity6 pirates			0
it also raised the possibility of military personnel being placed on commercial vessels to protect them from pirates			0
@entity133 , the committee ’s @entity200 chairman , said : ‘ the question anyone would ask is that if a private armed guard on board a @entity4 - flagged vessel sees an armed skiff approaching at high speed , can the guard open fire ? ' the government must provide clearer direction on what is permissible and what is not			0
‘ it is unacceptable that 2.6 million square miles of the @entity15 has become a no - go area for small vessels , and a dangerous one for commercial shipping			0
' there is a clear need to take decisive action			0
’ the committee also called on the @entity223 to review its procedures for dealing with @entity4 captives ’ families after the @entity227 criticised the department ’s support during their 13 - month ordeal as being limited to ‘ tea and sympathy ’ .			0
