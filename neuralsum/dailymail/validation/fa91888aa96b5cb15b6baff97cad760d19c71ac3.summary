in the much - loved @entity2 cartoons , it seemed that anything was possible – but the mayhem on the screen was born from writers that had incredibly strict rules to abide by			2
a former animator for @entity10 , which made the show , revealed in his autobiography that there were nine rules every cartoon had to follow			2
the star of each one was the @entity2 and his nemesis - @entity18			1
a desert predator obsessed with catching and eating the @entity2 , he often used a bewildering and hilarious array of contraptions to snare his quarry			0
the writers also had to try and ‘ make gravity the coyote 's greatest enemy ’ and ensure that he ‘ is always more humiliated than harmed by his failures ’			2
the rules come from the 1999 autobiography of former @entity48 animator @entity47 , called @entity49 : the @entity50			1
the star of each show was the @entity2 and his nemesis - @entity18			1
a desert predator obsessed with catching and eating the @entity2 , often using a bewildering and hilarious array of contraptions they were posted on twitter by director @entity58 and have since generated considerable excitement on social media			0
one @entity62 thread has been dedicated to a discussion about the rules , and whether they have ever been broken			0
one rule – ‘ the road runner must stay on the road , otherwise , logically , he would not be called road runner ’ – was broken many times , with the creature often appearing on rocky outcrops and once even pushing coyote along as he drives a speedboat			0
the cartoon first appeared in 1948 , with 48 made altogether , along with one half - hour special			0
the @entity2 can not harm the coyote except by going ' beep - beep ! ' no outside force can harm the coyote - only his own ineptitude or the failure of the @entity37 products the coyote could stop anytime - if he were not a fanatic no dialogue ever , except ' beep - beep ! ' the road runner must stay on the road - otherwise , logically , he would not be called road runner ( though this seems to be a rule that was often broken ) all action must be confined to the natural environment of the two characters - the southwest @entity100 desert all materials , tools , weapons , or mechanical conveniences must be obtained from the @entity37 corporation whenever possible , make gravity the coyote 's greatest enemy the coyote is always more humiliated than harmed by his failures			1

the rules were revealed by former @entity48 animator @entity47
he *listed* them in his book @entity118
the star of each show was @entity2 and his nemesis , @entity18
another rule was that the coyote always had to be humiliated , not harmed
