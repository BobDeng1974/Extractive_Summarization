pomegranates may help stop the spread of alzheimer ’s disease , claim scientists			1
an ingredient called punicalagin helps prevent the inflammation that destroys brain cells known as micrologia , according to a team at the @entity10			1
it is hoped the findings may also potentially benefit sufferers from rheumatoid arthritis and parkinson ’s disease by reducing painful inflammation from these conditions			1
the key breakthrough in laboratory experiments is showing that punicalagin - which is a form of chemical compound known as a polyphenol – found in pomegranate fruit , can inhibit inflammation in specialised brain cells known as micrologia			1
this inflammation leads to the destruction of more and more brain cells , making the condition of @entity24 ’s sufferers progressively worse			1
there is still no cure for the disease , but the punicalagin in pomegranate could prevent it or slow down its development			1
a new study was headed by dr @entity50 , who worked with co-researchers at the @entity10 ’s @entity52 and scientists at the @entity54 in @entity55			1
the team used brain cells isolated from rats to test their findings , which have been published in the journal @entity61			1
dr @entity50 is still working on the amounts of pomegranate that are required , in order to be effective in the form of a drug			0
however , he pointed out that juice products which are 100 per cent pomegranate contain approximately 3.4 per cent punicalagin			2
he said ‘ but we do know that regular intake and regular consumption of pomegranate has a lot of health benefits – including prevention of neuro - inflammation related to dementia			2
’ dr @entity50 says most of the anti-oxidant compounds are found in the outer skin of the pomegranate , not in the soft part of the fruit			2
although this has yet to be scientifically proven , pomegranate may be useful in any condition for which inflammation – not just neuro - inflammation of the brain – is a factor , such as rheumatoid arthritis , @entity90 ’s and cancer			1
the @entity92 fruit used for centuries as a folk medicine is claimed to be effective against heart disease , high blood pressure , inflammation and some cancers , including prostate cancer			1
the researchers identified a chemical compound punicalagin which can combat neuro - inflammation , file pic dr @entity50 is collaborating with organic chemist dr @entity104 , of the @entity10 , in order to produce compound derivatives of punicalagin that could the basis of new , orally administered drugs that would treat neuro - inflammation			1
meanwhile , a separate study has suggested that stimulating the brain using an electric current could improve memory – opening the way for treatment of related problems such as early - stage alzheimer ’s disease and stroke			0
@entity121 ( @entity121 ) activates a particular region in the brain via non-invasive delivery of electrical current using magnetic pulses			0
it has been used in a limited way to temporarily change brain function to improve performance during a test , for example , making someone push a button slightly faster while the brain is being stimulated			0
the latest @entity134 study shows @entity121 can be used to improve memory for events at least 24 hours after the stimulation is given			0
scientists recruited 16 healthy adults aged 21 to 40 who had a detailed anatomical image taken of his or her brain as well as 10 minutes of recording brain activity while lying inside an mri scanner			2
each participant underwent a memory test , consisting of associations between faces and words that they were asked to learn and remember , followed by brain stimulation 20 minutes a day for five consecutive days			0
both groups performed better on memory tests as a result of the brain stimulation			0
it took three days of stimulation before they improved , says a report in the journal @entity161			0
researcher @entity162 , at @entity163 , said ‘ we show for the first time that you can specifically change memory functions of the brain in adults without surgery or drugs , which have not proven effective			0
‘ this noninvasive stimulation improves the ability to learn new things			0
it has tremendous potential for treating memory disorders			0
’ dr @entity177 , @entity178 at @entity180 charity , said the results of this study shows some potential in the use of a non-invasive technique which may help to improve memory			0
‘ this was a very small trial with only 16 people and did not look specifically at people with alzheimer ’s disease or other forms of dementia			2
‘ much more large - scale , long - term research is needed to determine whether this technique would be beneficial to people with dementia			2

@entity24 's affects 800,000 people in the @entity26 with 163,000 new cases a year
researchers believe punicalagin in pomegranates could battle @entity24 's
the chemical could also *counter* painful inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis
scientists tested the impact of the fruit on the brains of laboratory rats
