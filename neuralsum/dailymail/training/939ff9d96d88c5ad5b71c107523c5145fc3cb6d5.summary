more than 1,600 new employees hired by the @entity2 @entity1 in the aftermath of @entity5 's passage include just two described as ' consumer safety ' officers , but 86 tasked with ' criminal investigating ' â€“ indicating that the agency is building an army of detectives to sleuth out violations of a law that many in @entity15 who supported it still find confusing			1
on the day president @entity18 signed the @entity5 into law in 2010 , @entity17 received authority from the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) to make as many as 1,814 new hires under an emergency ' @entity24 ' order			1
the @entity18 administration ordered that employment expansion despite a government - wide hiring freeze			2
@entity2 secretary of health and human services @entity30 , left , discusses the @entity5 at a news conference on aug. 13 , 2013 a total of 1,684 of those positions were filled			2
an analysis by @entity36 shows that at 2010 federal government salary rates , the new employees ' salaries alone cost the @entity2 at least $ 138.8 million every year			0
had the agency filled all its available jobs , that cost would have been a minimum of $ 159 million			0
the hiring began in may 2010 and continued through june 2013 , making the later hires eligible for higher salaries as a result of annual cost - of - living increases			2
the difference between what @entity17 spent on new @entity5 - related employees and what it was authorized to spend is explained by its failure to hire most of the 261 ' consumer safety officers ' it was authorized to bring aboard			1
only two such employees were hired			0
but while @entity21 authorized @entity17 deputy assistant secretary for @entity57 -- later renamed @entity58 -- to hire 50 criminal investigators , the agency increased that number to 86 on its own			1
after @entity36 lodged a @entity63 with @entity17 , the agency sent a spreadsheet containing records of the positions it filled , along with the salary level for each one on the government 's ' @entity70 ' hiring scale			1
on the day president @entity18 signed the @entity5 into law in 2010 , @entity17 received authority to make 1,814 new hires			1
@entity18 is pictured here on august 15 the lowest salary on the list was for a single contracting officer at @entity79 , an annual rate of about $ 42,350 , including a so - called ' differential ' payments			0
those increases are given to all federal employees in order to adjust for regional cost - of - living differences			0
the highest salary in 2010 dollars , including that differential payment , was about $ 161,450 , earned by a total of 29 new employee			0
they include health insurance administrators , contracting officers and information technology managers			0
the fleet of 86 new criminal investigators are earning a range of compensation between $ 51,800 and $ 89,350 , according to the 2010 salary tables and differential payment guidelines			1
@entity100 , a nonprofit that has told @entity36 it files ' hundreds ' of @entity102 requests , first published evidence in july of the @entity17 hiring binge			2
' sounds like we now have the @entity5 police , ' said the group 's president , @entity107 , after @entity36 showed him the new data			2
' given the confusion and problems of the law 's implementation , we would need a small army to police all the waste , fraud , and abuse that is already evident			0
' @entity118 , a conservative lobby group that opposes implementation of the @entity5 , told @entity36 that it sees the hiring of criminal investigators inside @entity17 as a sign that its position is more and more defensible			1
' the @entity18 administration continues to assert near unilateral power when it comes to @entity5 , ' said @entity127 , the group 's communications director			1
' this blatant disregard for the rule of law raises serious questions as to how these new criminal investigators will behave , what guidelines they will follow and who will provide much - needed oversight			1
' @entity118 is circulating a letter this week , penned by freshman gop rep. @entity137 , calling on @entity138 to ' take the steps necessary to defund @entity5 in its entirety , including on a year - end funding bill like a continuing resolution			0
' the @entity17 did n't immediately respond to a request for comment , but it responded to @entity36 's @entity102 request within the number of days the statute permits .			0
