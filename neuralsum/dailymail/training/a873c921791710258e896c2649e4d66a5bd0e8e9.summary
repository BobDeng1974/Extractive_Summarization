premier @entity9 was giving advice about the impending category @entity37 which was about to hit @entity10			1
due to the danger posed by the storm mr @entity8 's gestures were exaggerated to highlight the severity of the situation			1
@entity43 , editor of @entity44 , a blog for the deaf community said someone using sign language will change their mannerisms to emphasise certain words in the same way hearing people can do it with the inflection of their voice			1
mr @entity8 used the exaggerated signs to highlight the danger posed by @entity59 mr @entity8 said he would rather not be in the spotlight claiming that he was ' just hoping to fly under the radar ' he blogged : ' well , if you ’re signing about a storm , and telling people that they really need to take the advice you ’re giving them , otherwise they might be injured or die , it ’s not enough just to tell them – you need to show them , visually , through your demeanour , just how serious this situation is , and how powerful the storm might be			1
' and that ’s exactly what these interpreters are doing			0
watching the video video of @entity8 in action , he ’s no more animated than he should be , and the information he gives is perfectly clear			2
in some ways , the way these interpreters go viral every time a storm comes is a good thing , in terms of raising public awareness of @entity85 people – who are often so hidden from wider view – and of the language we use			2
' what worries me is that some people think that the interpreters are doing something comical – which they are n’t			0
' these skilled interpreters are n’t making fun of the situation , or giving people at home a cheap laugh			0
they ’re simply signing in the most expressive and powerful way they can in order to tell deaf people how they can remain safe			2
' people on @entity14 supportive of mr @entity8 's efforts managed to get the hastag # signguy trending some users used mr @entity8 's new - found popularity to have fun with @entity109 by manipulating his image however some deaf campaigners criticised some of the @entity109 efforts as they diminished his message mr @entity8 said he was slightly surprised by his new - found fame : ' i ’m sort of a private person			1
i ’d rather not be in the spotlight , but i know this is such an important thing to do , and i feel confident i can do a good job			0
' i ’m just hoping to fly under the radar and nobody will look at me afterwards			0
' following friday 's storms , some 700 troops have been placed on standby to help with cleanup efforts			0
premier @entity9 said : ' at this stage , everyone is breathing a deep sigh of relief that there has been no loss of life			2
' @entity133 @entity9 , left , said it was amazing there had been no loss of life however , most properties in the northern @entity10 towns of @entity140 and @entity141 had been left without power , she added			1
the worst of the rain would pass by sunday as the storm is moving quickly back out to sea , the weather bureau said			0
in @entity140 , long queues snaked out of the only fuel station left with the power to run its petrol pumps , as people flocked to refill cars and get fuel to operate generators			0
residents ducked fallen trees and power lines to gather at the few automatic cash machines still functioning			0
heavy machinery was pressed into assist efforts to clear debris on the road to @entity141 , the coastal town hit hardest by @entity59 , but fallen power lines left many roads impassable			0
in northern @entity1 , teams were heading to two communities on the remote islands of @entity169 and @entity170 to weigh up damage after @entity172 , packing wind speeds ranging up to 160mph , began to lash the @entity174 late on thursday .			2
