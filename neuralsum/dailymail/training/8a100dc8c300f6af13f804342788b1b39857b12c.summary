@entity9 , 36 , allowed @entity10 to wave off trains from station platforms even though he did not have a licence and had not been trained , @entity8 heard			1

' adjourning for sentencing , he said : ' i just can not stress how serious this is			0

he gave @entity10 a fake identity badge , along with a personal crash course and a set of training books			2

' @entity76 , defending , said his client had acted out of a desire to provide for his family while keeping up with his studies			0
he said : ' the reason for the crime was that he was trying to do two things at the same time - trying to cater for his wife and daughter , and at the same time go to university			0
' he shows remorse for what he has done			0
' it 's something he did unwisely , not realising the seriousness			0
