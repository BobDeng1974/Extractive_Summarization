by @entity1 reporter published : 01:16 est , 28 july 2013 updated : 06:49 est , 28 july 2013 new thinking : composer @entity2 says a new system is needed to end inequality when billionaire @entity5 pledged to give away 85 per cent of his fortune in 2006 , as part of a @entity8 where some of the country 's wealthiest people would do more to help charity , he was applauded			1
but , seven years on , his son @entity12 warns that just throwing funds at problems in society such as poverty and ill health can prevent a more permanent solution from being found			2
in an opinion piece in the @entity23 , the composer and chairman of the @entity21 warned that a donor 's desire to ' save the day ' could have ' unintended consequences			2
mr @entity2 said that after his father announced his decision to give away a large portion of his wealth , including donations to three foundations set up earlier for his children to run , the composer noticed a damaging cycle beginning			1
he told the @entity23 : ' people [ including me ] who had very little knowledge of a particular place would think that they could solve a local problem			0
' ' whether it involved farming methods , education practices , job training or business development , over and over i would hear people discuss transplanting what worked in one setting directly into another with little regard for culture , geography or societal norms			0
' an example of unintended consequences from a well - intentioned attempt to help others was when the distribution of condoms to prevent the spread of aids in a red - light district resulted in creating a higher price for unprotected sex			0
however , mr @entity2 said ' conscience laundering ' whereby the wealthy sleep better knowing they have donated large sums while the poor continue to have just enough to get by for the short term , is perpetuating the cycle of inequality			1
' there are plenty of statistics that tell us that inequality is continually rising			0
at the same time , according to the @entity80 , the nonprofit sector has been steadily growing , ' he said			1
' it ’s a massive business , with approximately $ 316 billion given away in 2012 in the @entity82 alone and more than 9.4 million employed			0
' the musician , who composed the score for the fire dance scene in the film @entity86 , said he was not calling for an end to capitalism but ' calling for humanism '			0
he added that as philanthropy became big business , it has become common to hear people asking what the ' return on investment ' is when discussing projects to help those in need			1
charitable : billionaire @entity5 pledged to give away 85 per cent of his wealth in 2006 fresh ideas : @entity102 and @entity2 support campaigns to find a more permanent way to address poverty he added that instead of working on projects that only help in the short - term , funds should be used to find ' ways to live in a functioning society that truly creates greater prosperity for all [ and i do n’t mean more people getting to have more stuff ] '			2
the composer 's @entity21 , which campaigns to end violence and discrimination against women , tries to address the problem by working to empower society to create a more caring environment , along with his wife @entity102 , mr @entity2 said he is committed to supporting ' conditions for systematic change ' .			1
