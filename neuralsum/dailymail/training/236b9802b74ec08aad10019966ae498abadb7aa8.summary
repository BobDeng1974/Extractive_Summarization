speaking after their encounter in @entity19 , @entity3 said he hoped the two leaders could collaborate in promoting the sacredness of life ‘ and the stability of families founded on marriage			1
’ gay marriage debate : pope @entity3 told the archbishop of canterbury today that he wants to work together to promote family values ‘ based on marriage ’ archbishop @entity12 has spoken out against the legalisation of gay marriage in @entity31 , saying it would undermine family life			1
the legislation would enable gay couples to get married in both civil and religious ceremonies in @entity37 and @entity38			0
the meeting of minds on the controversial issue is a rare moment of agreement between the two churches amid strained relations			1
the @entity3 praised the archbishop for ‘ recalling the value of marriage ’			1
he said : ‘ particularly important is our witness to the reference to @entity52 and the promotion of christian values in a world that seems at times to call into question some of the foundations of society , such as respect for the sacredness of human life or the importance of the institution of the family built on marriage , a value that you yourself have had occasion to recall recently			0
’ @entity3 has long taken a hard line on the issue			1
as archbishop of @entity74 he clashed with @entity11 president @entity75 on gay marriage , calling it an ‘ anthropological step backward ’			0
he has also insisted that adoption by gays and lesbians is a form of discrimination against children			0
today 's meeting was billed as a chance to reduce tensions between the @entity89 and @entity90 churches both leaders , inaugurated within days of each other , acknowledged differences between their churches archbishop @entity12 said the two churches were ‘ absolutely at one ’ on the issue of gay marriage			1
the major point of difference between the denominations has been the ordination of women priests in the @entity105 , which has since witnessed a steady stream of disenchanted @entity107 , who have been welcomed with open arms into the @entity110			2
his predecessor @entity111 caused uproar in the hierarchy of the @entity105 when in 2009 he introduced structures to ease disenchanted @entity107 into @entity89			0
the @entity3 acknowledged the ‘ painful history ’ between their churches , admitting that ‘ difficulties have arisen in our theological dialogue that were greater than we could have foreseen at the start of our journey			1
’ he added : ‘ the history of relations between the @entity90 and the @entity110 is long and complex , and not without pain			1
’ archbishop @entity12 said the differences between the churches were ‘ testing ‘			2
’ but a firm foundation of friendship will enable us to be hopeful in speaking to one another about those differences , ’ he said			0
the @entity131 's bold step to welcome back @entity107 came nearly 500 years after @entity132 broke away in 2009 , @entity111 decreed that @entity107 who feel their @entity110 had become too liberal could find a home in @entity89 in a parallel hierarchy that allows them to keep some of their traditions , such as parts of the @entity90 liturgy and the @entity139			1
it was the boldest step by the @entity131 to welcome back anglicans since @entity132 broke with @entity1 and set himself up at the head of the new @entity90 in 1534			0
@entity3 said he was sure the move would help the @entity89 world to better appreciate and understand the spiritual and pastoral traditions of the @entity90 community			2
@entity12 , a former oil industry executive , has inherited a church which is itself divided over issues such as gay rights and women bishops			0
he is against gay marriage but favours female ordination , and is stuck in the crossfire between liberal and conservative clerics			0
after addressing the pope and @entity131 officials , @entity12 went on to pray at the tomb of @entity160 under @entity161			0
the historic meeting comes as it emerges that @entity3 ’ predecessor , @entity111 , will escape prosecution for ‘ crimes against humanity ’ for his part in the church ’s cover up of abuse , including sexual violence			2
the @entity172 ( @entity172 ) has rejected an application by @entity174 to investigate @entity111 and other @entity176 officials , saying it is outside the jurisdiction of the court			2
legal experts had said that @entity111 could face charges after losing his immunity from prosecution as head of state after stepping down in february			0
lawyers for the victims claimed that @entity111 had been put in place policies through which abuse could continue .			0
