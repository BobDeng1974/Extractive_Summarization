by @entity0 published : 09:47 est , 17 november 2013 updated : 12:36 est , 17 november 2013 scientists at the centre of the furore surrounding the death of the world 's oldest - recorded animal , have hit back at claims they killed the 507 - year - old clam simply to find out how old it was			1
the giant mollusc - nicknamed @entity10 because it was born at the time of the @entity15 @entity14 - met its demise at the hands of marine researchers , when they froze it to take back to their lab at @entity22 in 2006			1
last week the researchers announced the clam was more than 100 years older than their initial 2007 estimate of 405 years old - but ended up facing a storm of consternation as reports suggested they had killed the animal while trying to find out its age			1
this is the only picture of @entity10 , believed to be the world 's oldest animal at 507 years old			1
not knowing the long life of the mollusc , researchers at @entity22 opened its shell for analysis , killing @entity10 in the process by counting the number of rings visible on the outer shell of the mollusc , researchers calculated that @entity10 was an incredible 507 years old dr @entity44 , a climate scientist from @entity22 , said @entity10 was one of many samples collected as part of a climate change research project that he was working on			1
he said that researchers had no idea of the animal 's age when they found it on the coast of @entity54 in 2006 , then dealt the fatal blow by putting it in a freezer before opening it			1
dr @entity44 said : ' this particular animal was one of about 200 that were collected live from the @entity54 shelf in 2006			2
' a quahog ’s shell grows a layer every summer when the water is warmer and food plentiful			0
by counting the number of rings visible on the inside of @entity10 ’s shell , scientists initially thought it was around 400 years old			1
@entity10 's life came to an abrupt end seven years ago when scientists from @entity22 dredged the seabed near @entity54 ( pictured ) as part of a study into climate change however , after analysing the clam more closely , the experts now believe @entity10 , who was named after the dynasty thought to be ruling @entity15 at the time of its birth , was a century older			1
‘ we got it wrong the first time and maybe we were a bit hasty publishing our findings back then , ’ @entity44 , from @entity22 , told @entity87			0
the findings mean the mollusc was born seven years after @entity93 discovered @entity94			2
it lay on the ocean floor throughout historical milestones such as the @entity98 , the @entity99 , the @entity100 and two world wars			0
while the lifespans of different species may seem random , there is a pattern			0
generally , big creatures live longer than small ones and this goes for plants as well as animals			0
at one end of the scale are mice and shrews , which live just a couple of years , while at the other are large animals like rhinos , hippos , giant tortoises , lions and elephants , which have life expectancies measured in decades - or even centuries			2
some @entity126 tortoises , for instance , have been recorded to reach nearly 200 years			2
the bowhead whales have been found recently with antique harpoons embedded in their skulls dating from the 1790s			0
unless these were a freak , this means that in the sea today there may be large , intelligent animals that pre-date the invention of the railway engine			0
other @entity139 include orange roughly , a @entity142 fish increasingly popular as food			0
these cold - water fish can live to more than 150 years old , meaning that your dinner could date back to a time when @entity149 @entity148 was still middle - aged			2
but there are some interesting anomalies			0
humans , for instance , live longer than is to be expected for our size			0
marine biologist @entity156 believes that @entity10 's ability to live for centuries could be down to the creatures slow metabolism .			1

the clam - nicknamed @entity10 - was killed when it was put in a lab freezer
researchers say it was gathered as part of a climate change project in 2006
@entity171 's age initially estimated at 405 years old at first analysis in 2007
@entity174 last week led to age being upped to 507 years
