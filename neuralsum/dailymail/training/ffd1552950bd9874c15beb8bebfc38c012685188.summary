by @entity0 published : 07:52 est , 11 may 2012 updated : 09:56 est , 11 may 2012 the @entity2 football team has long been seen as one of the best supported squads in the world			1
but it now faces the prospect of being deserted by fans ahead of this summer ’s @entity9 in @entity10 amid safety concerns and general apathy			1
mounting fears that local racist hooligans may use the major event to target fans from ethnic minorities and a spate of terrorist attacks are thought to have added to factors putting off supporters			2
shunned : only a tiny number of @entity2 fans look set to go to the @entity25 stadium , in @entity26 , @entity10 to support the @entity2 in @entity27 of the 9,000 official supporters tickets made available through the @entity29 , just 2,000 have been sold for @entity2 's opening game against @entity31 on june 11 at the @entity25 , in the former mining city of @entity26			1
and only 1,000 more tickets have been sold for the game against hosts @entity10 in the country 's capital @entity38 on june 15			1

assistant chief constable @entity42 , who is leading the @entity45 police involvement in the tournament , warned that @entity2 supporters could be goaded by local racist thugs			2
he said : ' it may be a flashpoint for some sort of disorder if fans feel they are being unfairly treated			2
' he said there was little intelligence that @entity2 fans were planning on causing trouble , adding : ‘ the reality is that the overwhelming majority of @entity2 fans heading to @entity27 are there to support the national team and the game of football			0
fears : the threat from terrorism , which @entity10 security forces have been training to prevent , and concern racist hooligans might target @entity2 fans all look to put supporters off ‘ those who engage in any trouble must realise that they will feel the full force of local policing laws			1
' anyone involved in football - related trouble can also expect to face a football banning order when they return to the @entity45			0
" @entity2 's recent run of poor performances in international tournaments also looks to have dented support			0
a @entity29 spokesman said : ‘ we are pleased with the @entity2 fans members who have bought tickets to support @entity2 in @entity10			1

a record 70,000 fans headed to @entity95 to support @entity2 during the 2006 @entity96			0
loyal : @entity2 could once count on some of the most loyal and fervent fans in the world , seen here at the @entity96 in @entity95 2006 , but recent poor form and lack of results has dented support but confidence in safety at this tournament has been hit by a series of devastating terrorists attacks			0
@entity93 have played down the threat of trouble and tried to reassure fans that security measures for @entity27 are adequate despite a series of explosions in the @entity10 city of @entity116			1
at least 27 people were injured in the blasts , which local authorities are believed to be treating as the work of terrorists			0
