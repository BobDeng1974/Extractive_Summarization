by @entity0 pope @entity1 has branded the sexual abuse of children by priests an ugly crime comparable to a ' satanic @entity6 ' saying he would show zero tolerance for anyone in the @entity9 who abused children , including bishops			1
speaking on the plane taking him back from a visit to the @entity15 , the pope also announced that he would have his first meeting with a group of abuse victims at the @entity19 early next month			1
' sexual abuse is such an ugly crime ... because a priest who does this betrays the body of the @entity25			2
it is like a satanic @entity6 , ' he said in some of the toughest language he has used on a crisis that has rocked the @entity9 for more than a decade			2
scroll down to see video pope @entity1 talks with @entity19 spokseman father @entity31 , right , during a press conference he held aboard the papal flight on his way back to @entity35 on the flight he announced he would meet soon with a group of sex abuse victims at the @entity19 and declared ' zero tolerance ' for any member of the clergy who would violate a child ' we must go ahead with zero tolerance , ' he said , adding that three bishops were currently under investigation			1
@entity1 said he would meet with eight victims and cardinal @entity47 of @entity48 , who is head of a commission set up to study ways of dealing with the crisis			1
speaking to reporters for nearly an hour on the plane taking him back from a visit to the @entity15 , the pope looked alert despite the gruelling three - day trip and overruled his spokesman who suggested the airborne news conference should be cut short to all him to rest			1
a fire was started at the @entity61 , a @entity9 sanctuary atop @entity63 in @entity65 's old city pope @entity1 and @entity67 prime minister @entity66 traded words on monday over the language spoken by @entity70 two millennia ago			1
' @entity70 was here , in this land			2
he spoke @entity74 , ' mr @entity66 told @entity1 , at a public meeting in @entity65 in which the @entity67 leader cited a strong connection between @entity78 and @entity79			1
' @entity81 , ' the pope interjected			2
' he spoke @entity81 , but he knew @entity74 , ' @entity66 shot back			2
like many things in the @entity15 , where the pope is on the last leg of a three - day visit , modern - day discourse about @entity70 is complicated and often political			1
@entity70 was born in @entity87 in the @entity89 - ruled region of @entity90 , now the @entity67 - occupied @entity91			0
he grew up in @entity92 and ministered in @entity93 , both in northern @entity67 , and died in @entity65 , a city revered by @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 , and to which @entity67 and @entity97 lay claim			0
palestinians sometimes describe @entity70 as a @entity97			0
@entity67 linguistics professor @entity101 says that both @entity66 , son of a distinguished @entity94 historian , and the pope , the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.2 billion @entity9 , have a point			0
' @entity70 was a native @entity81 speaker , ' he said about the largely defunct @entity108 language closely related to @entity74			0
' but he would have also known @entity74 because there were extant religious writings in @entity74			0
' @entity101 said that during @entity70 ' time , @entity74 was spoken by the lower classes - ' the kind of people he ministered to '			0
@entity1 said the victims , several from @entity115 , would attend his morning @entity6 and then he would meet with them			1
it will be the first time for @entity1 to meet sexual abuse victims since his election in march 2013			1
it was not clear , however , if the pope also meant zero tolerance for bishops who are not accused of being abusers themselves but who are accused of having turned a blind eye to abuse by priests in their dioceses or who may have covered up abuse scandals			1
@entity47 said last month in @entity35 that the commission he heads will recommend that negligent clerics be held accountable regardless of their rank in the @entity9			2
in many cases of abuse , most of which took place decades ago but surfaced in the past 15 years or so , bishops seeking to protect the @entity9 's reputation moved priests from parish to parish instead of defrocking them or handing them over to police			2
victims ' groups have pressed the @entity19 to hold bishops who either shielded abusers or were negligent in protecting children to account , along with abusers themselves			1
the executive director of the main @entity150 victims ' group , @entity148 , or @entity148 , dismissed the meeting as ' just utterly , utterly meaningless			2
' ' the simple truth is this is another gesture , another public relations coup , another nice bit of symbolism that will leave no child better off and bring no real reform to a continuing , scandal - ridden church hierarchy , ' said snap executive director @entity159			0
@entity159 said the pope has shown himself capable of making real change in other areas such as church governance and finance but has n't done so in dealing with sex abuse by catholic clergy			0
but a @entity150 attorney who represents clergy abuse victims hoped the meeting would be ' substantive and meaningful ' rather than for cosmetic purposes			2
attorney @entity171 said ' meeting directly with victims is the most powerful tool that the pope can use in understanding the ugliness and horror of clergy sexual abuse and why it must be stopped or prevented			2
' in february , the @entity179 accused the @entity19 of systematically turning a blind eye to decades of abuse and attempting to cover up sex crimes			1
the @entity19 called the report unfair and ideologically slanted			1
@entity1 spoke to reporters for nearly an hour , taking all 11 questions posed and responding with candor and occasional humor			1
he said he would travel to @entity188 for two days and the @entity189 in january 2015			0
and he suggested that he might follow in emeritus pope @entity191 's footsteps and retire if he no longer had the strength to do the job			0
' we need to look at him as an institution : he opened a door , the door of emeritus popes , ' @entity1 said			1
' only @entity199 knows if there will be others , but the door is open			0
' if and when the time comes , he said , ' i will do what the @entity25 tells me to do , pray and try to find @entity199 's will			0
but i think that @entity191 was n't a unique case			0
' @entity1 sought to lower expectations about his planned encounter in the @entity19 next month with the @entity67 and @entity97 presidents , which he announced during the trip			1
he stressed that they were coming to pray together , not enter into peace mediation			0
' we are coming just to pray , then everyone goes home , ' he said			0
' but i think prayer is important , praying together			0
' @entity67 's president @entity218 looks on as @entity1 greets children with cancer from the @entity221 at @entity218 ' residence pope @entity1 places an envelope in on of the cracks between the stones of the @entity226 he said he had originally hoped to arrange the encounter in @entity65 itself , but that the idea was scrapped because of the enormous logistical problems that would have been involved			1
preparations are already under way , he said , noting that a rabbi and @entity234 cleric would join him in leading the prayers			0
one of the more poignant moments of @entity1 ' pilgrimage came monday when he visited the @entity238 in @entity65 and kissed the hands of survivors in a show of humility and respect			1
@entity1 said his gesture came spontaneously			1
' the gestures that are the most authentic you do n't think about , ' ahead of time , he said			0
given his respect for @entity251 survivors , @entity1 was asked what he intended to do about the pending beatification case for pope @entity254 , the @entity255 - era pope accused by some jews of not speaking out enough against the @entity251			1
@entity94 groups have asked that the case be shelved pending the opening of the archives of his pontificate , or at least until the generation of @entity251 survivors has passed			0
@entity1 has bent the @entity19 's saint - making rules for a half - dozen people so far in his pontificate , waiving the usual second miracle requirement for example to canonize pope @entity267 last month			1
@entity1 , however , offered no such wiggle room for @entity254			2
' there 's still no miracle , ' he said			0
' if there are no miracles , it ca n't go forward			0
' just hours after @entity1 left a fire broke out at @entity61 , a @entity9 sanctuary atop @entity63 in @entity65 's old city			2
the fire , started by a suspected arsonist , damaged a guest book at the @entity65 holy site marking the location of @entity70 ' last supper .			0
