those who take finasteride ( also known as @entity15 ) to stop their hairline receding also tend drink less alcohol after starting the medication			1
the research , carried out at the @entity19 , revealed that two thirds of men who take the drug , and who develop side effects such as low sex drive , drink less as a result			1
it showed that this side effect continues even after the man has stopped taking the medication			0
@entity15 is the only once - a day pill developed to treat mild to moderate male pattern hair loss			2
in a clinical study of 535 men taking the drug , 99 per cent had visible results - growth or no further hair loss - after two years			2
it works by stopping the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone , or @entity40 , which is thought to be the active hormone in hair loss			0
researcher dr @entity43 interviewed 83 healthy men who developed persistent sexual side effects while taking finasteride			0
he also collected information relating to the men ’s medical histories , sexual function , and alcohol consumption before and after taking finasteride			2
of the 63 men who consumed at least one alcoholic drink per week prior to starting finasteride , 65 per cent noted a decrease in their alcohol consumption even after they stopped taking finasteride			2
thirty - two per cent reported no change in their alcohol consumption , and three per cent reported an increase in alcohol consumption			0
this could be because the drug reduces the brain 's ability to make hormones , called neurosteroids , which are linked to interest in alcohol @entity72 reports that many of the men also noted that they had a lower alcohol tolerance after taking the medication , that they felt more anxious after drinking , and that they recovered less quickly from the effects of alcohol			1
the researchers do not know why the drug has this effect upon people ’s drinking habits			0
however , dr @entity43 believes that it reduces the brain ’s ability to make hormones , called neurosteroids , which are linked to interest in alcohol			1
previous research has also suggested that finasteride can cause permanent , irreversible , impotence			0
dr @entity43 found that finasteride can cause persistent sexual dysfunction , including low sexual desire , erectile dysfunction and problems with orgasms			1
these problems , he discovered , often did not resolve themselves when the man stopped taking the drug .			0

@entity15 , or @entity15 , can also cause sexual dysfunction
two - thirds of these men will experienced a reduced desire to drink alcohol - even after finishing the drug
could be because it reduces brain ’s ability to make the hormones which make alcohol *tempting*
