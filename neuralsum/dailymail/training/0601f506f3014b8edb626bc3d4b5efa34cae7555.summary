by @entity0 published : 11:31 est , 30 august 2012 updated : 19:47 est , 30 august 2012 what a find : @entity3 skipper @entity2 caught the glass bottle , one of 1,890 designed to sink downwards and float close to the seabed in an attempt to monitor the under - currents of the seas around @entity3 , in one of his fishing nets it 's doubtful whether he 'll get the sixpence finders fee offered in 1914			1
but @entity3 skipper @entity2 will probably settle for the glory - and a new world record - after discovering a message in a bottle 98 years after it was thrown into the ocean			1
me @entity19 came across the bottle by chance while hauling in his nets , but almost lost it after it fell back into the sea before he rescued it			0
he then noticed it contained a message asking the finder to record the date and location of the discovery and return the item to the @entity34 for @entity3 - for a reward of sixpence			0
the crew learned the bottle - labelled as drift bottle @entity38 - had been thrown into the sea almost a century ago by captain @entity41 of the @entity42			1
it was one of 1,890 bottles designed to sink downwards and float close to the seabed in an attempt to monitor the under - currents of the seas around @entity3			2
to date , only 315 of the bottles have ever been located , but @entity51 ’s @entity41 ’s original log , now held in @entity52 by @entity53 , is still updated every time one is tracked down			0
incredibly , the discovery was made on @entity56 , the same @entity58 - based fishing boat which recorded the previous world record for the longest time a drift bottle has been known to spend at sea , in 2006			1
mr @entity2 , 43 , joked that his friend and colleague @entity62 , who set the previous record in was ' very unhappy ' his find had been surpassed			2
he said : ' he never stopped talking about it and now i am the one who is immensely proud to be the finder of the world record message in a bottle			0
' as we hauled in the nets i spotted the bottle neck sticking out and i quickly grabbed it before it fell back in the sea			0
i could n’t wait to open it			0
' it was an amazing coincidence that the same @entity58 fishing boat that found the previous record - breaking bottle six years ago also found this one			1
' it ’s like winning the lottery twice			0
this is a very popular fishing ground , with half the @entity87 fleet fishing here			0
' @entity3 environment secretary @entity89 added that it was possible another of the bottles released in 1914 could go on to break the record again			2
he said : ' the story of scientific drift bottles is a fascinating one and harks back to an area when we were only beginning to understand the complexities of the seas			2
return to sender : the message inside the bottle asked the finder to record the date and location of the discovery and return the item to the @entity109 - for a reward of sixpence coincidence : incredibly , mr @entity2 made the discovery on @entity56 , the same @entity58 - based fishing boat which recorded the previous world record for the longest time a drift bottle has been known to spend at sea , in 2006 ' it ’s amazing that nearly 98 years on bottles are still being returned to the @entity118 and in such fantastic condition			1
' with many bottles still un-returned there is always the chance in the coming years that a @entity3 drift bottle will once again break the record			1
' dr @entity125 , @entity126 with @entity127 , said : ' drift bottles gave oceanographers at the start of the last century important information that allowed them to create pictures of the patterns of water circulation in the seas around @entity3			1
new world record : mr @entity2 said scoring two world records for the longest time a drift bottle has been known to spend at sea was ' like winning the lottery twice ' ' these images were used to underpin further research , such as determining the drift of herring larvae from spawning grounds , which helped scientists understand the life cycle of this key species			1
' the conclusions of these pioneering oceanographers were right in many respects , for example , they correctly deduced the clockwise flow of water around our coasts			0
' however , it took the development of electronic instruments in the 1960s before the true patterns of current flows , and more importantly what causes them , were unlocked			0

@entity3 skipper @entity2 discovered drift bottle on same boat which recorded previous record - breaking bottle in 2006
bottle was thrown in to see by captain @entity41 of @entity42 in 1914
drift bottles gave oceanographers important information about water circulation in seas around @entity3
