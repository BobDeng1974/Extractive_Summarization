by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 has admitted feeling sorry for @entity3 after watching his former team - mate 's formula one world title hopes suffer a string of crushing blows			1
@entity2 , though , does feel the battle for the championship has become ' spicy ' following the warfare that has unfolded between @entity11 and @entity13 team - mate @entity12			1
@entity3 claimed , in a heated @entity16 @entity15 meeting , @entity12 said he opted not to avoid their lap - two collision to ' make a point '			1
collision : @entity13 team - mates @entity12 and @entity3 collided in @entity22 , ending @entity3 's race it was an incident which ultimately ended @entity3 's race , with the @entity25 now 29 points adrift of @entity12 , who went on to finish second behind @entity28 's @entity27			1
@entity12 has since stated his version of events is ' very different ' to @entity3 's , but has refused to elaborate , preferring to keep such matters ' internal '			1
@entity2 has been left amazed by @entity3 's appalling run , with events on sunday at @entity34 following his brake - disc failure in @entity36 and car fire in @entity38 , both during qualifying at those races			1
' i feel for @entity3 , he was leading the race ... it is unbelievable , ' said @entity2 , who partnered @entity3 at @entity43 for three years from 2010 - 2012			2
' i 've never seen such bad luck , or misjudgement on other people 's part , for @entity3 to lose so many points over a period of races			2
podium : the @entity36 driver went on to claim to second place , putting him 29 points ahead of @entity3 ' it 's astonishing , really			1
i 've never seen that before , especially when you have a car that is so dominant and they should be first and second every race			2
' it is just a matter of fighting it out and beating your team - mate , although i know that takes its toll			1
' but for me @entity3 has come across really well in the media after some disappointing races			2
' he has definitely grown as an individual , which is good to see , and has taken it on the chin			0
' hopefully it will build his confidence for the rest of the season rather than shatter it			0
' the veteran 34 - year - old has been left perplexed by @entity12 's attempt to overtake @entity3 , adding : ' there was nothing there			1
' all there was was going off the circuit			0
fault : @entity2 said @entity12 had no right to try and overtake @entity3 , and blamed him for the crash @entity91 wins as @entity12 hits @entity3 ' i think any driver would look at it now , and i am sure @entity12 will look at it and say , ' i do n't know what was i thinking '			1
' you should be able to judge situations like that a bit better			0
' @entity2 , though , is relishing the rest of the campaign between the duo given what unfolded on and off track at @entity34			0
' it is a shame it is not a cleaner fight , ' added @entity2			0
' i 've always said the person who wins the world championship this year is the person who does the best job on the circuit , but that does not quite seem the way it is at the moment			0
matured : @entity2 said @entity3 has ' grown as an individual ' and praised his maturity this season ' they ( @entity13 and one of the their drivers ) will still win the championships , but what has happened definitely adds spice to what is already a pretty spicy relationship			2
' is it good for the sport ? it 's negative because we did n't see a good battle between those two			0
' but it does get everyone excited about the next grand prix in @entity133 where none of the fans will be cheering for either of them and would love a coming together			0
' it adds spice , but it 's a shame in that true racers want to see them fighting			0
