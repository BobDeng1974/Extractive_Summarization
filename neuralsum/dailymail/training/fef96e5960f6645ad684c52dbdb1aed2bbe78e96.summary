they may be movements able - bodied people take for granted , but a robotic hand has been programmed to give a thumbs - up , scoop objects and pinch			1
and , not only can it carry out this unprecedented range of movement with ease , each motion is controlled using brainwaves of the wearer			2
over the past two years , a quadgriplegic has used the hand to give high - fives to researchers , feed herself chocolate and now give a thumbs - up using simply her thoughts			1
the @entity29 model of the hand could grasp and high - five			1
the new @entity32 model can now abduct fingers ( top left and right ) , scoop , pinch ( bottom left ) and extend the thumb ( bottom right ) @entity39 , 55 , from @entity23 has been paralysed from the neck down since 2003 due to a neurodegenerative condition			1
she signed up to the @entity23 ’s study in 2012 , and was fitted with two quarter - inch electrode grids			1
each electrode has 96 contact points covering regions of her brain that are responsible for right arm and hand movements			1
after the electrode grids in ms @entity39 ’s brain were connected to a computer , creating a brain - machine interface , the contact points picked up pulses of electricity that were fired between the neurons			2
computer algorithms were then used to decode these firing signals and identify the patterns associated with a particular arm movement , such as raising the arm or turning the wrist			0
the researchers used a virtual reality computer program to calibrate ms @entity39 ’s control over the robotic arm			2

the researchers then used a virtual reality computer program to calibrate ms @entity39 ’s control over the robotic arm ( pictured ) following this training , ms @entity39 was able to make the robotic arm reach for objects , as well as move in a number of directions , and flex and rotate the wrist , simply thinking about the movements			1
it also enabled recently her to high - five the researchers and feed herself chocolate			1
the previous hand was called @entity29 , but the latest , more advanced model is known as @entity32			1
the @entity32 has extra dimensions that come from four types of hand movements - finger abduction , scoop , thumb extension and a pinch			1
this range of motions means ms @entity39 is more able to pick up , grasp and move more objects , more precisely than before			2
the @entity32 has extra dimensions that come from four types of hand movements - finger abduction , scoop , thumb extension and a @entity111 range of motions means ms @entity39 is more able to pick up , grasp and move more objects , and more precisely , than before ( example objects used in the study are pictured ) it is hoped these results , published in the @entity118 , can build on previous demonstrations and eventually allow robotic arms to restore natural arm and hand movements in people with upper limb paralysis			1
co-author of the study dr @entity127 said : ‘ @entity128 allowed @entity39 to interact with objects in different ways , just as people use their hands to pick up objects depending on their shapes and what they intend to do with them			0
‘ we hope to repeat this level of control with additional participants and to make the system more robust , so that people who might benefit from it will one day be able to use brain - machine interfaces in daily life			2
‘ we also plan to study whether the incorporation of sensory feedback , such as the touch and feel of an object , can improve neuroprosthetic control			0
’ ms @entity39 added : ‘ this has been a fantastic , thrilling , wild ride , and i am so glad i ’ve done this			0
‘ this study has enriched my life , given me new friends and co-workers , helped me contribute to research and taken my breath away			0
for the rest of my life , i will thank @entity163 every day for getting to be part of this team			0
’ @entity39 , 55 , signed up to the @entity23 ’s study in 2012 and has nicknamed the arm @entity167 in 1996 , @entity39 was a 36 - year - old mother of two , running a party business			1
one day she noticed her legs seemed to drag behind her			0
within two years , her legs and arms progressively weakened to the point that she required a wheelchair , as well as an attendant to assist her with dressing , eating , bathing and other day - to - day activities			0
in 1998 she was diagnosed with spinocerebellar degeneration , in which the connections between the brain and muscles slowly , and inexplicably , deteriorate			0
in february 2012 , after screening tests to confirm that she was eligible for the study , dr @entity184 from the @entity23 placed two quarter - inch square electrode grids with 96 tiny contact points each in the regions of ms @entity39 ’s brain that would normally control right arm and hand movement			1
two days after the operation , the team hooked up the two terminals that protrude from ms @entity39 ’s skull to the computer			0
within a week , ms @entity39 could reach in and out , left and right , and up and down with the arm , which she named @entity167 , giving her 3d control that had her high - fiving with researchers			2
within three months she also could flex the wrist back and forth , move it from side to side and rotate it clockwise and counter-clockwise , as well as grip objects			0
in a study task , called the @entity208 , ms @entity39 guided the arm from a position four inches above a table to pick up blocks and tubes of different sizes , a ball and a stone and put them down on a nearby tray			0
she also picked up cones from one base to restack them on another a foot away , another task requiring grasping , transporting and positioning of objects with precision .			0

the @entity23 ’s arm connects to the brain using electrodes
a wearer can then control the *device* simply by thinking about movements
previously , the @entity29 model of the hand was shown to grasp and high - five
the new hand , called @entity32 , can now give a thumbs - up , scoop and pinch
a *quadriplegic* used the hand to feed herself chocolate for the first time
the range of hand movements has been under *development* for two years
