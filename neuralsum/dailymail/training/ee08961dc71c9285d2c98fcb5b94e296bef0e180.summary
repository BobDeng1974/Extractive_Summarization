by @entity0 published : 19:05 est , 30 november 2012 updated : 09:31 est , 1 december 2012 @entity2 's wife had to watch on tentatively as her husband was put through the mill after he launched his much criticised foray into boxing			1
the former @entity8 cricket star was floored in his first professional contest watched not only by his wife @entity10 from the stands but celeb pals @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
@entity2 has received criticism from a number of corners for the sports switch and many assumed he would be handed an easy bout to launch his new career			1
scroll down to hear from @entity2 after the bout celebrations : @entity2 celebrates his win while wife @entity27 cheers as his victory is announce on points in the @entity30 job done : @entity2 celebrated after beating @entity32 in the four - round bout winner : @entity2 sports a cut near his eye as he arrves at the after fight party at @entity38 in @entity39 fighting fit : @entity2 gets out of a taxi outside the @entity38 where he celebrated after the bout if that was the case he made hard work of it , having been floored by his @entity46 opponent @entity32 at the @entity47			1
the former @entity8 captain , and his impressive support , went from the agony of the second round flooring however to ecstasy , when he claimed the win on the referee 's scorecard			2
even then it was by the narrowest of margins , however , as he took the tie 39 - 38			0
@entity2 entered the ring weighing considerably less than his @entity46 opponent , having tipped the scales 25lb lighter at the weigh - in on thursday			1
embrace : @entity2 leans over to see his wife , @entity27 , after the bout gracious : @entity2 consoles his defeated opponent whoops : @entity2 was caught flush in the second round the former @entity8 cricket captain had been training under the tutelage of @entity71 and his son @entity72 and had shed over three stone over four - and - a - half months			1
his decision to take up the sport , particularly at a professional level , had been widely criticised , particularly by @entity78 and @entity79 heavyweight champion @entity77 who stopped @entity80 earlier in the evening in @entity81			0
but @entity2 had insisted his venture was not a stunt , despite the presence of @entity86 television who chronicled his progress for a three - part documentary			1
and despite poor projections , the @entity47 was close to full , although the atmosphere was some way short of that generated by @entity95 's comeback at the same venue last saturday			0
nervous ? @entity97 took her seat before the fight celebrity fan : @entity14 was in the @entity47 to support his friend @entity2 and there 's more : @entity14 's fellow comedian @entity13 turned up me too ! former cricketer and radio broadcaster @entity15 @entity32 , from @entity106 , had been hand - picked to face @entity2 and brought over an unbeaten record after three fights			1
the 23 - year - old was raised by his sister and brother - in - law until he was 18 while his mum and dad both served time in prison			0
he was shot four times in the back when working as a driver in the drugs trade but turned the corner when he took up boxing			0
he had the added benefit of experienced trainer @entity122 , who trained @entity95 for his unsuccessful comeback , in his corner after his trainer was unable to obtain a visa			0
but when he came out at the first bell , @entity32 looked the less experienced as @entity2 led with his jab and looked to land with his right hand			2
he had his man on the ropes and edged the opening session			0
winner : @entity2 @entity134 - eyed : @entity2 picked the @entity46 off in one of his flurries flush : @entity2 lands a straight contrast : the two fighters strike a pose after the bout but @entity32 threatened to spoil the party in the second when he landed a right that send @entity2 to the canvas			2
he rose quickly however and beat the count and normal service was resumed in the third as @entity32 was forced back on to the ropes time and time again			0
the @entity46 seemed content to hold and try to land another big shot but his lack of activity was never going to catch the referee 's attention and it came down to a winner - takes - all final round which @entity2 controlled , using his right hand effectively .			2

his wife @entity10 watched on as @entity2 *recovered* from a *knockdown* to win his first fight
he was also cheered on by celebrity friends @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15
