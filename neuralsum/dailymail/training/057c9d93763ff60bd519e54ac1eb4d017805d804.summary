first , a health warning : anyone eating breakfast should skip to the sports section			1
in january of this year a group of doctors in @entity6 published a study using ' friendly bacteria ' in the most extreme way possible			1
they were treating a group of patients with an infection caused by a bacterium called @entity15 ( @entity15 ) - which grows when your normal bowel bacteria are wiped out by antibiotics			1
it can cause severe diarrhoea and even death			0
ironically the treatment of @entity15 infections is usually another strong course of antibiotics , but instead the @entity26 group used the ultimate probiotic : a faecal transplantation			0
the power of porridge : dr @entity31 ate oats every day for six weeks to assess the impact on his gut bacteria that 's right : they took donor faeces from healthy volunteers ( screened for every imaginable disease ) and infused it via a tube into the patients ' small intestines			1
the treatment was so effective that the trial was stopped early			1
it was a small trial , and not without flaws , but it should prompt research in an area of medicine where we are only just beginning to understand our ignorance : the bacteria living inside us			1
you are more bacteria than you are human : for every one of your cells , you have at least ten bacteria and most of them live in your gut			1
for every one of your human genes , you have 200 bacterial genes			0
these bacteria living inside you are called your microbiome and they 're not parasites ; without them you would die			1
we have outsourced some of our most vital functions to the bugs living in us and their influence extends beyond mere digestion ; they help us extract up to 30 per cent of our calories from food , especially during early life , so they 're essential for brain development			1
they protect us from harmful bacteria , help metabolise drugs , control inflammation and absorb essential nutrients			1
the bacteria in fat people even seem better able to absorb calories than those found in thin people			1
every month more and more functions are found , but the one most of us have heard of is their role as having the largest immune function in the body			2
it 's now thought maternal bacteria can cross the placenta , so even before birth a mother 's microbiome directly influences her baby 's			2
anyone who 's watched a birth knows it 's not a clean process and babies often start to swallow bacteria from their mothers even as they are being born			2
when in the gut , those bacteria start to educate the immune system			1
one disadvantage of having a @entity106 may be that it prevents this exposure to these vital bugs			0
modern changes in how mothers , babies and children are exposed to bacteria may be one reason for a rise in asthma , allergies and other conditions			2
the effect of unnecessary antibiotics on the development of this delicate system is not fully understood , but is likely to be detrimental			2
ludicrous : the idea that there could be one simple drink with one simple bug in it that could make us all feel better is farcical i 'm an infectious diseases doctor , so i 'm normally interested in destroying ' bad ' bacteria , but for the @entity133 programme @entity131 i 'm a doctor , i found out more about the ' friendly ' ones that you have probably heard about through the vague , comforting science of ' probiotic ' or ' live ' yoghurt adverts			2
a daily dose of these friendly bacteria is claimed to have a wide range of health benefits , but you may find it hard to buy anything called ' probiotic ' any more because the @entity147 has decreed something can only be called a probiotic if it has a proven health benefit - and the criteria are very strict			1
there is evidence that taking probiotics with particular species of bacteria in them will help in specific situations ( such as infectious gastroenteritis , diarrhoea associated with taking antibiotics , or irritable bowel syndrome )			2
even for an expert , knowing what to take can be very hard			0
dr @entity165 is a surgeon at @entity166 and is doing some of the most exciting research in this area			2
i met him for the programme and he summed it up by saying : ' if you 're well it does n't seem like they 'll make you any better			2
' but he uses probiotics when there 's a problem			0
some research shows that , in a large enough dose , bacteria can make it through the harsh conditions of your stomach acid to the large intestine where they can live more easily , so it 's plausible they could have a benefit			2
but , once there , it must compete with thousands of other species in a complex ecosystem			0
@entity165 compares the microbiome ( the bacteria living in you ) to a vast rainforest			1
he says taking a probiotic to make it ' generally healthier ' is like tinkering with the red squirrel population in @entity200 and expecting it to have a beneficial effect on the @entity204 jungle - it 's possible we know more about the @entity204 rainforest than we do about our own insides			0
we each have thousands of different species in our bowels , and everyone has their own unique ecosystem			0
the idea there would be one simple drink with one simple bug in it that could make us all feel better is surely a bit ludicrous			0
what we do know is the fat and sugar found in some probiotic preparations can have negative health effects			2
ironically , this may be because of the effect fat and sugar have on gut bacteria			2
luckily , you do n't need to worry about finding precisely the right dosage and species of bacteria that 's right for you			1
there 's a much simpler , cheaper treatment : porridge			0
' the fat and sugar found in some probiotic preparations can have negative health effects			0
' we 've long known high - fibre foods , including oats and green leafy vegetables , have many beneficial effects on health			1
but , even as a doctor , my understanding of why fibre is good for you was incomplete			0
i had a vague feeling that roughage worked by cleaning you out , sort of like a brush , and thus got rid of toxins			0
while this is n't completely untrue it 's probably more to do with good bacteria in your gut being able to thrive on the indigestible sugars in fibre			1
the sugars act as ' prebiotics ' - a prebiotic is any substance in food which causes a health benefit by affecting gut bacteria ( another term the @entity147 are strict about using , as it implies a proven health benefit )			1
but i wanted to put this to the test , so i went for two weeks with no oats and then six weeks eating more oats than even the man with the caber on the oat packet seems to ( a treat for me as i usually have two huge cold lumps of salty porridge per day )			1
i then sent stool samples to @entity278 at the @entity279 in @entity280 ( the experience gave me new sympathy with patients i ask to send in a stool sample : not easy or dignified to collect			0
again , apologies if you 're reading this over breakfast )			0
@entity278 is interested in the effect of diet on the health of gut bacteria and , appropriately for her lab in @entity296 , the main food she studies is oats			1
@entity278 did a genetic analysis of bacteria in my stool sample each week : as the diet went on the species changed			0
some died out , others massively expanded their numbers			0
the importance of fibre : fresh green veg and oats have many beneficial effects on health , especially , as dr van @entity31 's experiment showed , because they feed gut bacteria i felt great , but in larger studies @entity278 found these changes improve the ecology of the system immensely			1
to extend the rainforest analogy : if swigging a yoghurt drink is throwing a few seeds into the forest , significantly altering your diet is like changing the soil and the weather : get it right and the good stuff will flourish			0
once fed , bacteria can perform all their functions and release beneficial compounds into your blood stream			0
these have wide - ranging effects from the lining of your gut to your heart and bloodstream			0
for most of us , it 's the prebiotics in the food we eat which has the major effect on the health of your gut and the bacteria in it			1
the reason food may be good or bad for you is because it changes the populations of bacteria and the chemicals they produce			0
so while @entity165 and other groups continue to probe the frontiers of your inner universe with the most advanced molecular techniques known to man , i leave you with a conclusion that would have your grandmother saying i told you so : eat more porridge oats			1
@entity31 is an infectious diseases doctor at @entity361 , and an @entity363 research fellow at @entity361			1
@entity364 i 'm a doctor is on @entity133 on thursday at 8pm			0
he also presents @entity366 every monday 530pm cbbc.contact him on @entity367 @ @entity368			0

the bacteria living inside you are essential to your immune system
' @entity375 ' drinks , full of bacteria , claim to have a range of health benefits
but even the experts are n't entirely sure how helpful these yoghurts are
dr @entity31 *decided* to see how effective the fibre in oats is
after six weeks of eating tons of porridge , the results were *compelling*
