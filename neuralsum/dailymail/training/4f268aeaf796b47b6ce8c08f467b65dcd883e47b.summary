the news was immediately welcomed by one of her leading council critics , @entity25 , who said : ‘ there will be a feeling of immense relief across the county			2
‘ it has been a very unhappy chapter in @entity33 ’s history especially for those of us who voted against her appointment in the first place			2
‘ she introduced cuts but her position became more and more tenuous as she refused to take a pay cut herself - she was obviously not willing to share the pain with the rest of us			2
’ ‘ it is no secret that the public were very angry about her salary and hopefully there will be full transparency when her successor is appointed with clear salary guidelines - which was not the case with mrs hill			2
’ today ’s announcement , which came after a 90 - minute meeting of the council ’s dismissals appeals committee , follows increasing pressure on mrs hill to quit			2
in a statement today , a spokesman for @entity8 said : ' following a lengthy discussion last friday , and negotiations between representatives of both parties over the weekend , the county council can now confirm that mrs @entity7 will be leaving her post with immediate effect			1
' today 's announcement , which came after a 90 - minute meeting of @entity8 's dismissals appeals committee , follows increasing pressure on mrs hill to quit an independent inquiry was launched into both the accusations of bullying and excessive expenses claims			1
the council ’s dismissal and appeals committee met to discuss its conclusions			2
the spokesman added : ‘ bullying and harassment allegations were robustly investigated			2
although it remains a concern that such a perception existed , the committee is satisfied that there was no evidence to support those claims			2
’ march 31 : @entity8 confirms @entity88 , director of resource management , and @entity90 , monitoring officer , have left the council			1
@entity92 , acting head of legal services , takes on the role of monitoring officer			0
april 1 : @entity96 , leader of the conservative - run council , stands down after six years in his post , saying he wants to give a new leader " time to settle " before council elections in 2013			0
april 4 : mr @entity92 is found hanged in @entity101 , near @entity102 , @entity33			0
police say they are not treating his death as suspicious			0

regarding her expenses claims , the committee admitted ‘ there were undoubtedly claims which , in the current climate , might not represent best use of public money ’			0
but it ‘ accepted that there was no dishonesty ’			0
two senior long - serving council officers resigned suddenly earlier this year , which was followed by the apparent suicide of the head of legal services , @entity92 , who had worked for the council for more than 20 years			0
an anonymous whistle - blower complained to councillors about mrs @entity7 ’s management style which led to a detailed investigation by a leading @entity157 law firm whose report was considered before today ’s crunch meeting			1
mrs @entity7 had come to @entity33 from a similar job as head of @entity163 county council			1
but a little over three years later , under intense fire for her official life style - thousands of pounds of ratepayers ’ money spent on ‘ vanity ’ portrait photographs , nights in luxury hotels and expensive ‘ team building ’ lessons - her reign is over			0
a legal inquiry into claims by a whistleblower about mrs hill - which has cost thousands of pounds - formally ended last friday when the council ’s dismissals appeals committee met for five hours to consider its conclusions			0
after weeks of negotiating between lawyers behind closed doors , the authority has agreed that mrs @entity7 will leave - in her handbag a settlement agreement totalling £ 218,592			1
she has been on extended leave since @entity18 at the @entity189 home she shares with her husband @entity190 and their three children and will now be able to spend more time with her family			1
before she went on leave @entity195 circulated an extraordinary 1,800 - word defence to council employees claiming her critics were motivated by envy and that she should be seen as a ‘ role model ’			2
instead , she said , she had been attacked by the media and political opponents , her children had been bullied , her friends pestered and her staff abused			0
she also alleged that some websites called for people to carry out ‘ extreme acts of violence ’ against her			0
but there ’s no triumphant legacy for mrs @entity7 either - her controversial ‘ @entity214 ’ policy lies in tatters			1
the new council chairman , @entity118 , moved swiftly last month with a promise to scrap large parts of its plan to hive - off services such as libraries , recycling and school crossing patrols			0
but it was mrs @entity7 ’s six - figure salary which placed her among the highest - rewarded council chiefs in the country that angered many ratepayers			1
not only because it was awarded without the proper procedure , according to critics , but because it was topped up a payment of some £ 50,000 a year ‘ deferred pay ’ put into mrs @entity7 ’s pension pot. by contrast the man she took over from , @entity237 , had earlier announced he was giving up a £ 36,000 performance - related bonus , seemingly happy with his £ 200,000 a year as chief executive of @entity241			1
mrs @entity7 stridently pointed out that she had turned down pay increases totalling £ 210 a week but would not consider any reduction in her current salary			1
in an interview with the local paper ’s local government reporter - who was blacklisted for exposing some of mrs @entity7 ’s spending follies - she insisted : ‘ i do understand it is a big salary but i got the job in open competition			1
‘ anybody in the country could have applied for it - in fact many people did and they were chief executives on similar salaries to mine			0
’ and while it did n’t impress librarians or lollipop ladies who were facing the sack at the time , mrs @entity7 seemed proud that she had set a good example			1
she said : ‘ actually i have taken a lead on pay restraint because i decided , quite by myself , to give up a pay increase of £ 5,000 and i gave up another increase in 2009 of over £ 6,000 so that ’s £ 11,000 i have forgone			2
‘ i have considered that i have already given up two pay increases and i think that was the thing to do at the time and i wo n’t be taking another pay cut			0
’ what won the imperious mrs hill few friends was her adamant assertion that she was worth her huge salary because she was in ' a high - risk job			0
' it prompted one angry ratepayer to write pointing out some might consider a young @entity33 soldier in the @entity283 fighting in @entity284 on a tenth of her salary was the one in a real high - risk occupation			0
mrs @entity7 never replied or acknowledged the letter .			1
