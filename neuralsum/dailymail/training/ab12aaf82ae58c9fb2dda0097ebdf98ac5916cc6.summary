by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:27 est , 1 november 2013 updated : 20:47 est , 1 november 2013 millions of families could benefit from a crackdown on water bills , as @entity5 tries to seize back the cost of living agenda			1
ministers will announce a package of measures to shake up the market next week , to ensure customers get a ‘ good deal ’			1
while households have no choice over their water supplier , it is expected to include more discounts or ‘ social tariffs ’ for pensioners and the low paid			1
this would also help reduce the soaring burden of bad debts – worth around £ 1.6billion a year – which firms currently add to the water bills of other households			1
bills : @entity5 , pictured on a visit to the @entity30 outside @entity31 today , has ordered ministers to draw up action on water charges unlike energy firms , whose prices are hiked every year by the @entity39 firms , annual water bills , currently an average of £ 388 per family , are set in advance by industry regulator @entity44			1
but water firms have been criticised for using legal loopholes to avoid £ 1billion of corporation tax , and paying millions of pounds in bonuses to their executives during last year ’s hosepipe ban			1
the move comes as @entity54 leader @entity53 called for the water industry to be ‘ scrutinised ’ to ensure it is not ripping off customers			2
the coalition has been stung by claims it has failed to act on easing the squeeze on family finances , with mr @entity53 taking the lead with his promise to freeze gas and electricity bills for two years if he wins the next election			2
but today @entity68 insisted mr @entity5 ‘ wants to see household costs coming down ’ and targeting the water industry will be the next stage			2
the @entity71 has already offered water customers in the @entity73 a £ 50 rebate to tackle historically high bills			1
however , the new action to be set out by environment secretary @entity77 is likely to offer help to customers across @entity80 with the details expected to be agreed this weekend			2
mr @entity5 ’s official spokesman said : ‘ clearly the prime minister wants to see household costs coming down			0
‘ there will be some progress next week which @entity71 will be doing on the water industry and water bills			1
’ the government had already taken action to freeze council tax bills , limit rail fare rises and cancel increases in the cost of @entity96 , he added			2
water watchdog @entity44 is preparing to block an eight per cent rise in charges demanded by @entity99 for next year , which would add an extra £ 28 to the average bill			1
the @entity102 spokesman added : ‘ the prime minister wants regulators there to look at the industries they regulate and make sure that they are as robust and delivering what they need to deliver for customers			0
‘ the prime minister realises that families are hard - pressed			0
he wants to see prices brought down across the board			0
’ options being considered include making social tariffs for the poorest customers compulsory , capping fare rises to an amount linked to inflation and cutting the bad debt caused by customers who refuse to pay which adds £ 15 - a - year to every bill			1
costs : the @entity71 is to rush out action to limit water bill rises in an attempt to take back control of political debate over the cost of living details of the action on water bills are expected to be announced in the middle of next week , with @entity137 denying it had been caught on the hop by mr @entity53			1
chancellor @entity140 signalled the government 's plans in a speech last month when he said : ' there are important improvements we can make to the scale of energy and water bills , the cost of housing , the fees paid for everyday financial services , the expense of rail and road travel			1
' these are a burden on families – and we are doing everything we can do to reduce their cost – with more to come this autumn			0
' but mr @entity53 appeared to steal a march on the government yesterday with his warning that the industry could not escape scrutiny at a time when families are struggling to make ends meet			0
warning : the government actions comes after @entity54 leader @entity53 said the water industry should be next to face more scrutiny ‘ i think we should be looking at all markets to make sure they are working properly and that includes the water industry , ’ he told the @entity174 yesterday			2
‘ some people will say this is an anti-business agenda			0
i think it is a pro-business agenda that you have got to reform markets that are not working properly			0
‘ i think the water industry is something that should be scrutinised to make sure it is working properly and make sure it is working properly for the benefit of consumers , because i know concerns have been raised			2
‘ i 'm proud @entity54 is championing this agenda and i think it is consistent with believing what a market economy can do , and water is part of that			0
’ a @entity197 said : ' the government is working across the board to reduce the cost of living and help hardworking households who are feeling the pinch			0
' we want to ensure customers get a good deal from the water sector and will be setting out our approach next week			1
' @entity210 , @entity54 's shadow environment secretary said : ' @entity5 has never shown any interest in rising water bills and has wasted three years doing absolutely nothing to address the impact on already over-burdened family budgets			1
' more than two million households , over one in ten , now spend more than five per cent of their income on water according to the regulator and customers in @entity221 face some of the highest bills in @entity223			1
' yet @entity5 still refuses to require water companies to introduce a social tariff to help those who are struggling , even though only three companies have introduced such a scheme under the current voluntary arrangement			0
' that ’s why @entity54 will use the forthcoming @entity232 legislation to require all water companies to participate in a national affordability scheme and review whether there is a need for a tougher regulatory regime			0
' it comes after figures this week showed the squeeze on family budgets has lasted for four years and shows no sign of coming to an end , grim new figures revealed today			0
disposable incomes have remained almost unchanged since the end of the recession , with the return to economic growth having little impact on ordinary people ’s spending power			0
instead bills for life ’s essentials like housing , energy and petrol have dramatically eaten into incomes , and now account for more than 27 per cent of all spending			1
the @entity260 warned the economic position of households ‘ remains under pressure ’			0
disposable incomes grew even when @entity221 was plunged into recession in mid- 2008 , but have remained ‘ broadly flat ’ since the summer of 2009 , despite the economy growing by 4.2 per cent since then			0
in particular big rises in energy bills have had a devastating impact on families .			2
