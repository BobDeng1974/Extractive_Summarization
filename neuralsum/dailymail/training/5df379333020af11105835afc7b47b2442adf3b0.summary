by @entity0 from a battered metallic ' electric egg ' to an angular rocket , these are how the world 's top designers once thought the cars of the future would look			1
an exhibition has brought together 19 concept cars over the ages , and while some may resemble what we have today , others are out of this world			1
with names like @entity18 and @entity19 , the designs were almost never destined for sale			0
instead they were a way for fiercely competitive car firms to flex their muscle and put a stamp on history			1
@entity27 : @entity29 artist @entity28 built his three - wheeled @entity30 in 1942 to help him get around the streets of @entity32 during the war , and in many ways it was a precursor to the smart cars of today people - carrier : fewer than 10 1936 @entity37 were hand - produced by the @entity39 @entity38 , which wanted ' a virtual living room on wheels '			1
it was based on the scarab beetle and could seat seven made to order : @entity44 commissioned the @entity45 himself in 1934 because he wanted a sleek car like those he had seen in @entity50			2
many features were considered radical but appeared in later @entity52 sleek : @entity29 aeronautical pioneer @entity54 unveiled his @entity56 at a 1934 show in @entity32 as a statement of modernist luxury			2
he had to adopt new techniques as the @entity29 car industry declined after 1929 and they introduced revolutionary ideas which would go into mainstream production decades later , such as heated seats , proximity sensors and rear view cameras			1
the concept cars have been collected from across @entity50 and the @entity39 for a new exhibition at the @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity72			1
they were all built as fully - functioning cars - but many have not been driven for several years			1
included in the exhibit are the 1942 @entity77 ( @entity27 ) , created by @entity29 engineer @entity78 for his personal use in the streets of @entity32 during the @entity81			0
and the designs resurged after the war ended , with @entity84 producing the rocket - shaped @entity85 - 21 in 1953 which had hints of the space race that was to come			0
taking influence from a real jet , the car even ran on a gas turbine - which proved far too expensive to enter commercial production			1
legend : @entity94 now make some of the world 's fastest cars , and the @entity97 was made by @entity98 himself in 1935			2
its rounded look was a departure from the boxy style of the day			0
pictured is a 2007 recreation speedy : only five 1941 @entity106 were built but they were touted as ' @entity107 , ' built to educate the public about aerodynamics and streamlining			0
they foretold many later designs in the 1950s @entity113 : the 1948 @entity114 ( @entity115 ) included mobile fiberglass front fenders which turned with the wheels			0
the t - top roof design with removable panels influenced the 1968 @entity120 pet project : @entity39 engineer @entity122 created the @entity123 for his personal use			0
it was touted as a ' little workbench project ' but took @entity127 more than two and a half years to build and cost him $ 10,000 experimental and concept cars surged in popularity in the 1930s , after the automobile turned from simply a modern mode of transport into a statement of style and independence			1
they became known as ' dream cars ' in the 1950s , and allowed engineers the freedom to invent new technology which would find a practical outlet in cars produced decades later			2
hundreds were produced by designers as diverse as @entity50 artists and @entity39 car giants			2
the designs in the exhibition , which date from 1932 to the present day , chronicle battles to conquer fashion trends which either seem outdated , have since resurged or both			0
one such contest was for the ' ultimate wedge ' , won in the minds of some by @entity161 firm @entity160 's @entity159 in 1970 - rising just 33 inches off the road			0
bizarrely enough , the bright orange triangular profile of the car resembles many of the @entity50 supercars of today			2
razor - sharp : @entity84 ' @entity166 ( 1951 ) was its first post-war concept car made of exotic sheet and honeycomb aluminum , several large magnesium castings , and fiberglass			1
it even had heated seats screen star : hugely ahead of its time , the @entity174 ( 1956 ) had no rear view mirror - replaced by a rear - mounted camera with a wide - angle lens and 4x6 - inch view screen embedded in the dashboard space race : influenced by the @entity185 jet , @entity84 ' 1953 @entity183 was the first gas turbine - powered car in the @entity39 and described as a ' jet fighter on four wheels '			1
it proved too costly for mass production storm : the 1959 @entity192 had a soaring bubble canopy , sweeping fenders and dramatic fins - all cues from jet aircraft			0
its proximity - sensing radar was a forerunner to beeping sensors found in modern cars streamlined : the 1955 @entity203 was designed by @entity161 @entity204 who began a battle of the wedge , nicknaming his car @entity209 after @entity211 's sleek title character in the film noir of the same name the exhibition opens on may 22 and lasts until september 7			1
it explores the designs through five themes : individual makers , the impact of styling , visionary designers , the design process , and the influence of automobile fairs			0
as well as the actual cars , the exhibition includes conceptual drawings , patents and scale models			0
museum director @entity230 said : ' our previous exhibition was tremendously successful in bringing new audiences to the museum			0
' with @entity235 , we continue our commitment to showcasing the importance of design and encouraging future innovation			0
' back to the future : concept cars took a leap in 1970 with the @entity243 , which was just 37 inches high			1
it had sliding doors and bowling ball - inspired orbs on the console in line with the wheels king of the wedge : the 1970 @entity253 debuted months after the @entity243 and was four inches squatter			0
the seats are between the front wheels and the only way inside is by raising the perspex windshield leap forward : the exhibition includes modern concepts such as this 2001 @entity260 ( the @entity261 means @entity262 ) , which has tensile fabric stretched over a moveable body frame of aluminum and flexible carbon fiber modern : the most recent concept car is the 2010 @entity268 , the first to address its own environmental impact			1
unlike most of in the exhibition , the car has recently come on the market - for $ 850,000			2

some bizarre concepts resemble cars today - others are out of this world
*vehicles* were *rarely* sold but would be produced by car firms to show off
they introduced heated seats , proximity sensors and rear view cameras
display of 19 concept cars is at @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity72
