@entity0 will be invited into @entity2 ’s backroom team at @entity3 with the forward almost certain to miss the rest of the season following surgery on a collapsed lung			1
the @entity8 have backtracked on their initial estimate that the 26 - year - old would be missing for eight weeks			1
instead , it now appears likely that @entity12 will only make a return to competitive action next season after @entity2 admitted there was no timescale on his recovery			1
@entity0 has only played two @entity20 games for @entity3 since joining from @entity21 @entity12 ( left ) was signed by @entity22 in the summer , but has struggled with injuries this season the former @entity21 captain will visit @entity26 ’s training ground for the first time on friday following last week ’s operation			1
and @entity2 will ask @entity12 to play a behind - the - scenes role during his rehabilitation			1
he explained : ‘ we did something similar with @entity33 when he was injured and he did some scouting			0
but with @entity0 i might ask him to come in and watch the under - 21s or the youth team and give me some feedback			1
‘ i want to make him feel part of the club because i think he 's a little bit frustrated			0
’ @entity12 ’s frustration comes from a series of injuries which have limited his @entity20 starts this season to just one			2
he picked up a calf problem in pre-season and suffered a torn thigh muscle in september			0
the £ 6million summer signing was due to make his comeback at @entity50 last week when he was diagnosed with a collapsed lung for the second time			1
@entity2 now looks set to offer the attacking midfielder a behind - the - scenes role while he recovers @entity12 captained @entity21 , the club he had been at since youth level , before joining @entity3 in july and @entity2 added : ‘ he 's come here with a big reputation and he 's not been able to get on the pitch and give something to the fans			1
‘ he got so close and then it 's like chopping his legs away			0
so if can use him around the place i 'd be mad not to			0
’ @entity12 first suffered a collapsed lung at the beginning of last season with @entity21 but his recent surgery is thought to have corrected the weakness , although it is not known when he will be strong enough to resume training			1
‘ i have n’t put a timeline on his return , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ the most important thing is how he feels			0
this was a big operation he had			0
so it ’s really in his hands			0
we wo n’t force him before he is ready to come back			2
‘ but he ’s such a positive guy he might be back quicker than anyone expects			0
’ meanwhile , @entity3 will learn on friday if midfielder @entity81 ’s season is over			2
he picked up a knee injury playing for @entity83 during the @entity84 and it is feared he will miss the remainder of the campaign			0
@entity26 are not happy that their player has returned with a injury and could now take further action if tests reveal serious damage .			2
