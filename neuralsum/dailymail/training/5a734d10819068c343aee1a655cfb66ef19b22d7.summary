by @entity0 published : 21:04 est , 22 june 2012 updated : 06:51 est , 23 june 2012 although a man who was 32 was n't breaking the law by having sex with a 17 - year - old girl in 2008 , he was by photographing the act , the @entity1 ruled thursday			1
@entity8 was convicted in @entity9 of making child pornography and sentenced to 8 years in prison			1
he admitted he had sex with the girl when she was 17 , which is the age of sexual consent in @entity15			1
guilty : @entity8 , 35 , is serving an 8 - year prison sentence for child pornography , for photographing himself having sex with his 17 - year - old girlfriend in 2009 in a 5 - 2 ruling , the high court said that although the law allows 17 - year - olds to consent to sex , they are still minors , making photos or video of such sex child porn			1
the consequences of sexual activity are apparent to teens , but the consequences of being in pornography are n't , the court found			1
' these concerns are exacerbated in the modern digital age , where once a picture or video is uploaded to the @entity41 , it can never be completely erased or eradicated , ' justice @entity35 wrote for the majority			2
' it will always be out there , hanging over the head of the person depicted performing the sexual act			2
' the majority also noted that @entity49 in 1984 changed the definition of a minor in child pornography to anyone under 18 because it found ' the previous ceiling of 16 had hampered enforcement of child pornography laws since , with the 16 - year - old ceiling , there was sometimes confusion about whether a subject was a minor since children enter puberty at different ages			2
' ruling : the jury ruled that since the 17 - year - old was still a minor at the time , the photos were pornographic ( stock photo ) the two dissenting justices said that because the photos do n't show an illegal act , they should n't be illegal			0
' there was nothing unlawful about the production of the photographs taken by defendant in this case because the sexual conduct between defendant and ( the girl ) was entirely legal , ' wrote justice @entity81 , who was joined by justice @entity82			0
' the photographs are therefore not child pornography as defined by the @entity84 @entity1 for purposes of the @entity86			0
' attorney @entity87 of the @entity88 represented @entity89			0
she said the office has n't decided whether to challenge the ruling			0
the @entity92 changed the age of consent for pornography from 16 to 18 in 1985 , she said			1
' this apparently is the first case that has arisen challenging that , ' @entity87 said .			0

age of sexual consent in @entity15 is 17
