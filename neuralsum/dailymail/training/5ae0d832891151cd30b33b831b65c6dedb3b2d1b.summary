by @entity0 the men known as the @entity2 - who were wrongly convicted of the vicious rape of a jogger in 1989 - have agreed on a $ 40 million settlement with the city of @entity8			1
the resolution will mark the end of a 12 - year legal battle the five men have fought after they spent years in prison as a result of the attack which shocked the nation and led in part to the implementation of mayor @entity20 's clean up of @entity8			1
the men initially filed a $ 250 million civil - rights lawsuit after the overturn of their false convictions in 2002 for acting as a ' wolf pack ' of ' wilding ' youths who attacked 28 - year - old jogger @entity28 in 1989			1
the men have settled for $ 40 million for their wrongful conviction for the rape of a 28 - year - old woman in @entity39 in 1989			1
@entity40 has called the payout ' a disgrace ' the five men - @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity28 , @entity34 and @entity31 - were tried and found guilty of the rape of the investment banker and all served prison time			1
she was in a coma for 12 days and was left with permanent damage and no memory of the attack			2
all the men were aged 14 - 16 at the time of their arrest and alleged police brutality forced confessions from them			1
they also argued at the time that key dna evidence was ignored during their trial which would have triggered a not guilty verdict			1
the five black and @entity63 men had their convictions overturned in december 2002 , when an investigation discovered @entity58 proof they had not raped her , but that she was attacked by one lone man			1
this man , @entity28 , a convicted rapist already in prison , confessed to acting alone in the assault and the men were freed			1
the agreed deal , which must be approved by the city comptroller , averages out at roughly $ 1 million for each year of imprisonment for the five men			2
that means that @entity31 , who spent 13 - years in prison , will be the largest single payout @entity8 has made in a wrongful conviction case			1
the other four men all served around seven years in prison			1
the men are all in their late 30s or early 40s now and @entity8 mayor @entity85 was said to be keen to have the case settled			1
this was in direct contrast to former mayor @entity89 who argued the original $ 250 million suit was too high because authorities acted in good faith			0
arrest : in this april 22 , 1989 file photo , @entity28 , 15 , second from left , and @entity34 , 14 , right , are led from the 24th precinct by a detective after their arrest in connection with the rape and severe beating of a woman jogging in @entity39 indeed , according to the @entity104 , the city 's @entity102 backed this opinion at the time			1
' the case is not about whether the teens were wrongly convicted , ' a department spokeswoman said			2
' it ’s about whether prosecutors and police deliberately engaged in misconduct			0
' the attack on 28 - year - old investment banker @entity28 occurred on april 19 , 1989			1
it was one of the most notorious crimes in @entity8 history and it mesmerized the nation , serving as a lurid symbol of the city 's racial and class divide and its rampant crime			2
it gave rise to the term ' wilding ' for urban mayhem by teenagers			0
@entity8 was just crime central at that time , ' said former @entity8 detective @entity132 , recalling an era so blood - soaked that the city had a record 2,245 homicides in 1990 , compared with 414 in 2012			2
' you were scared to ride the trains after dark			0
it was such a different place			0
' @entity28 was out jogging in @entity39 on april 19 , 1989 , when she was bound , gagged , raped and beaten nearly to death , a chilling crime to which five teenage boys confessed after hours of interrogation by @entity8 police			1
from the start , the rape of a 28 - year - old white woman in the park drew intense media coverage and led to the term ' wilding ' to describe gangs of youths terrorizing random passersby			1
the five were convicted in 1990 based on the confessions , delivered after interrogations that in some cases lasted overnight			2
twelve years later , @entity28 , a murderer and serial rapist who had attacked a woman in the park two days before @entity166 's assault , confessed to the crime , and dna testing tied him to the rape			1
in a 2002 report recommending the convictions be vacated , prosecutor @entity170 concluded that the boys ' confessions contained ' troubling discrepancies ' and that @entity177 ' description of the attack matched the crime scene			1
a judge vacated the convictions			0
by then , however , the boys had already been released after serving sentences ranging from five years to 13 years			2
in 2002 , @entity185 commissioner @entity184 appointed a panel to produce its own report , which concluded that the boys likely attacked @entity166 before @entity177 did			1
former prosecutor @entity188 , who co-authored the report , said @entity190 erred in dismissing the boys ' confessions entirely			0
' it seems impossible to say that they were n't there at all , because they knew too much , ' he said in an interview			0
lawyers for the plaintiffs said the belief that the boys are guilty is pervasive among the dozens of police officers who have been deposed			0
' they protect each other , ' said @entity204 , a lawyer for the five			0
' it 's always like this			0
' however , in prison , three of the men , @entity33 , @entity208 and @entity209 said they were innocent but acknowledged they were in the park committing assualts - but not rape			1
mr. @entity34 indicated in his hearing that the larger group was out to rob people			2
' i took part in with the beatings of that man , ' he said			0
' if i could go back in time and not do it again , you know , it would have been a whole different story			0
' the men ’s lawyers have long said that their clients committed no crimes in the park that night			0
when @entity166 was found in the brush , more than 75 percent of her blood had drained from her body and her skull was smashed			2
she was in a coma for 12 days , left with permanent damage , and remembers nothing about the attack			0
@entity166 later went public as a motivational speaker and wrote a book			2
@entity34 and @entity33 , both 14 at the time , @entity32 and @entity242 , 15 , and @entity31 , 16 , were rounded up and arrested			1
after hours of interrogation , four of them recorded confessions on video , in some cases with the boys ' parents in the room			0
bravery : @entity28 , the @entity28 published a book about her harrowing experience - waiving her anonymity to reveal her recovery and the trauma she experienced at the trials , their lawyers argued the confessions were coerced			1
at the time , dna testing was not sophisticated enough to make or break the case			0
in 2002 , a re-examination of the case found that dna on the victim 's sock pointed to @entity28 , a murderer and serial rapist who confessed that he alone attacked the jogger			1
then - district attorney @entity271 stopped short of declaring the @entity2 innocent but withdrew all charges and did not seek a retrial			0
( the statute of limitations for charging @entity177 had run out ; he is serving a life sentence for other crimes			0
) @entity278 , one of the lawyers for the five , said the dna was the key			0
' there was never any forensic evidence that tied them to this case , ' he said			0
' in 1989 , everybody might not have been forensic savvy , but now , after ' @entity287 , ' everybody knows if there 's no dna , they did n't do it			2
' but an overturned conviction does not automatically mean there was any wrongdoing by prosecutors or police			0
legal experts said the case took a long time in part because of the money and reputations at stake			0
the two - hour documentary , ' the @entity2 , ' made the case that the men were wrongly convicted			1
the film uses extensive interviews with the men and their families , and lawyers for the city went to court to demand outtakes for use in the civil case			0
the defendants ' lives since they got out of prison have not been easy			0
@entity34 sold drugs and was sent back to prison , but now , along with @entity33 and @entity208 , has become the public face of the case , speaking out against wrongful convictions and racial profiling			1
' we are over being angry			0
now it 's about helping others , raising our own families right , ' said @entity34 , now 39 last year .			2

@entity39 5 - @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity28 , @entity34 and @entity31 - to settle 25 - years after the crime
convicted of the april 1989 rape and beating of 28 - year - old investment banker @entity28
crime stunned nation after @entity166 was left for dead and with no recollection
@entity39 5 were all aged between 14 - 16 and claimed the @entity185 coerced them into confessions
they all served between seven and 13 - years behind bars
in 2002 new dna evidence discovered a convicted rapist was *responsible*
he confessed and the men were *exonerated* of the brutal crime
the men , now in their late 30s and early 40s have spent more than a decade fighting for huge settlement
