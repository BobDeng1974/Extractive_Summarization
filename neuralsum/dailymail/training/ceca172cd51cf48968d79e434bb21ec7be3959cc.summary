' an initial figure put forward was for groups of greater than eight people			0
this was an initial discussion point , and the @entity140 is working with stakeholders and the @entity206 to develop our proposal and confirm the agreed numbers			0
' once this number is confirmed , groups of greater than that size visiting the bridge will be requested to inform the trust of their visit			0
