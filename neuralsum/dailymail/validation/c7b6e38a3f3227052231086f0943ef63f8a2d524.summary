@entity0 turned on the style in front of @entity4 national coach @entity3 as @entity5 continued their revival with a 24 - 18 win over @entity9 to climb into @entity11 's top eight			1
the @entity12 have collected five points out of a possible six since @entity3 arrived to take up a short - term advisory role at the club and it was @entity0 , who was given his @entity18 debut by @entity3 as a teenager at @entity20 , who once more stole the show on @entity23 's 300th @entity11 appearance			1
the former @entity25 and @entity26 stand - off scored one try and provided the scoring pass for @entity5 's three others to further underline his return to the form that earned him the @entity33 title in 2011			2
@entity0 put in a stylish performance for @entity5 @entity35 in their win over @entity9 on sunday the @entity12 , who were led out by @entity23 , were virtually at full - strength with the return of major close - season signings @entity41 and @entity42 , and showed signs of becoming a force this year			1
@entity9 , who gave 18 - year - old @entity45 his second appearance , had their moments but were left to contemplate a third successive defeat after starting the season with back - to - back wins			0
@entity51 scored a try and set up three for his side as @entity5 moved into the @entity11 's top eight @entity51 had the chance to help his side open the scoring when he re-gathered the ball from @entity42 's high kick but his trademark " no - look " pass found a defender instead of a team - mate and @entity9 went on to dominate the rest of the opening quarter			1
impressive full - back @entity68 's 40 - 20 kick set up the position for left winger @entity71 to go over only to be brought back for a forward pass , while centre @entity73 had a try disallowed for a double movement before loose forward @entity78 's break paved the way for stand - off @entity80 to score the opening try			0
@entity68 's conversion made it 6 - 0 but the @entity12 struck twice in a five - minute spell to turn the tables on the visitors			2
@entity51 picked off a pass by his former half - back partner @entity89 to get winger @entity90 away for an 80 - metre try and then produced a short pass for second rower @entity93 to score his first try for the club			0
@entity97 added both goals to make it 12 - 6 and was then denied a try by being held up over the line			0
@entity5 looked to be firmly in command when @entity51 dummied his way over for a solo try three minutes into the second half , @entity97 making it 18 - 6 , but @entity9 were in no mood to roll over			2
@entity109 @entity108 , just back on the field for the injured @entity111 , caught the @entity5 defence napping by forcing his way over from dummy half for his side 's second try , which @entity68 goaled			0
@entity23 then produced arguably the highlight of the match , a 50 - metre break , to set up the position for @entity51 to get centre @entity120 over for a fourth try , with @entity97 maintaining his 100 per cent with the boot			1
@entity9 battled to the end and were rewarded with @entity68 's opportunist try but @entity5 never looked like surrendering their lead .			0

former @entity129 scored a try and set up three in win
@entity23 led @entity12 out in his 300th @entity11 match
@entity5 have five points from six since advisor @entity3 arrived
