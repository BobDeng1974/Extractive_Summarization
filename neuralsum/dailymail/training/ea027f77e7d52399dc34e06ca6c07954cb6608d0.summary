there is no proof that chocolate and red wine help you live longer , despite millions hoping they do , scientists claim			1
a study failed to find any evidence that resveratrol , an ingredient found in the skin of red grapes and chocolate , is linked to long life			2
the antioxidant is believed to have a range of anti-ageing properties			0
but researchers say levels found in the body had no ‘ substantial influence ’ on inflammation , cardiovascular disease , cancer or longevity			2
no link : a study failed to find any evidence that either chocolate or red wine helps stave off disease resveratrol is one of a number of so - called ‘ healthy chemicals ’ found in red wine , called poly - phenols , which are also available as supplements			1
previous studies have shown the plant compound improves the health of mice fed a high - fat diet and increases their lifespan			1
but there has been controversy about whether it really does hold back the march of time , with conflicting results from some studies on chocolate			0
@entity52 researchers said the latest study was designed to investigate the ‘ @entity58 paradox ’ , the phenomenon of low heart disease rates in @entity58 despite a diet high in cholesterol and saturated fat			1
the paradox has been attributed to the regular intake of red wine , in particular to resveratrol			1
dr @entity65 , of the @entity66 , @entity67 , and colleagues recruited 783 men and women aged 65 or older			0
all of them had taken part in a study between 1998 and 2009 focusing on two villages in the heart of @entity79 ’s @entity78 wine - growing area			2
dr @entity65 and his team measured resveratrol levels in the urine of the volunteers at the start of the @entity78 study in 1998			0
over the following nine years 268 of the volunteers died			0
of 639 who had initially been free of cardiovascular disease , one in four ( 174 ) developed heart problems , and 34 of the 734 who were free of cancer went on to develop the disease , says a report in @entity95			0
the researchers divided the volunteers into four based on high to low resveratrol intake but found virtually the same proportion of deaths between the groups			1
dr @entity65 said : ‘ resveratrol levels achieved with a @entity104 diet ... do not show any apparent protective association with disease … and are not associated with lifespan			1
’ @entity108 , of the @entity109 , said : ‘ people should continue to eat plenty of fruit , veg and wholegrains			0
‘ we recognise the need to learn more about the action of resveratrol though , so are funding research into its reported disease - combating properties and how it affects the heart and circulatory system			2
‘ this research is vital because it could potentially form the basis of future medicines			0

@entity52 researchers set out to investigate low heart disease ' @entity58 paradox '
phenomenon *occurs* despite diet *traditionally* high in cholesterol and fat
it was thought that a chemical called resveratrol in red wine was the reason
but *extensive* tests found no link to disease protection or lifespan
