by @entity1 reporter published : 14:48 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 06:43 est , 18 april 2013 web users have turned into detectives in the wake of the @entity6 tragedy , looking through hundreds of photos to find the person or group behind monday 's carnage			1
as authorities conduct an exhaustive investigation of the moments leading up to the double bombing near the finish line , @entity16 and 4chan users are doing one of their own - pointing out people at the site of the first bombing whom they think the @entity23 should be talking to			1
there is , however , no official evidence to support that the individuals pictured had anything to do with the devastating twin bombing , which claimed three lives and injured 183 others			1
the claims are merely speculation , and not considered viable evidence in the @entity35 and federal investigation			1
meanwhile , @entity36 reported that a suspect has been identified by police after two pieces of video evidence at the scene of the second blast were handed in to authorities			2
@entity36 's @entity63 said sources told him it was a ' dark - skinned man ' and @entity66 reported that it was a white man who was wearing a black jacket , a gray hooded sweatshirt and a white or off - white baseball cap backwards			2
he is said to be six feet or 6 - feet - 2 - inches tall with a medium build			0
investigators have not named any suspects in the bombing , but have revealed that two pressure cooker bombs were stuffed inside black vinyl backpacks or duffel bags when they went off			2
using that information and numerous photos - mainly from the site of the first blast - users have pointed out several people either wearing black backpacks or otherwise individuals who could be thought to be acting strangely before the explosions			1
the people are circled and their movements are documented by comparing several photographs in a subreddit called ' @entity90			2
' the person who started the subreddit , who goes by the moniker @entity94 , has been identified as a 23 - year - old professional poker player who lives in @entity35 , according to reports			1
the @entity23 's @entity35 office did not return a call from @entity100 for comment			2
@entity102 : it 's possible that this man is an undercover police officer , but redditors claim that he may be involved in one series of photos , one internet user marks a face the crowd two hours prior to the bombing , and then his reaction afterward , noting that the man , wearing a white hooded sweatshirt , does not appear interested in the race and can be seen walking away calmly after the first blast			1
while some posts may be perceived as accusatory , other users are quick to warn that just because the person is pictured with a black bag , it does n't mean they had anything to do with the bombing			2
spotted : one user marks a face the crowd two hours prior to the bombing , and then his reaction afterward , noting that the man , wearing a white hooded sweatshirt , does not appear interested in the race in another photo posted on both 4chan and @entity16 , a man wearing a blue coat is pictured near the scene of the second explosion holding a backpack - with distinctive black and grey straps			1
next to it is a photo of a mangled backpack from the crime scene , with straps that bear a striking resemblance			0
another man , wearing a green hat and wearing a black backpack , was also highlighted on @entity16 as a person who could be involved			1
the @entity6 was a public event , and hundreds of black backpacks were worn among the thousands of attendees			1
@entity149 for clues : another man , wearing a green hat and wearing a black backpack , was also highlighted on @entity16 as a person who could be involved but at the very least , it gives people a glimpse of the excruciating job the @entity23 have in scouring through thousands of images in a situation where anyone can look like a suspect			1
yesterday , a preliminary probe by @entity35 officials revealed that they were made of two 1.6 - gallon pressure cookers - one containing shards of metal and ball bearings and the other packed with nails - and both stuffed into black backpacks or duffel bags , according to a source close to the probe			1
the method used to make the bomb is reminiscent of the failed attempt to bomb @entity178 by @entity179 in 2010 - and other terror strikes in @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184			0
the @entity23 and anti-terror officials have urged the public to turn in any photos or video footage they may have of the marathon that may have captured a suspect or suspects before the blasts			0
descriptions : picking out people from the crowd , the web sleuths comment on their behavior before the bombs went off @entity199 , who works in public relations in an office on @entity202 and was directly above where the first bomb exploded , responded to that call			0
in a piece he wrote for @entity207 , mr @entity199 said that he was standing at his second floor office window and snapping pictures of the runners and crowds below when ' a bomb went off in my face			0
' investigators have circulated information about the bombs , which involved kitchen pressure cookers packed with explosives , nails and other lethal shrapnel – but the @entity23 says no on has claimed responsibility			0
' someone knows who did this , ' @entity224 , @entity23 agent in charge in @entity35 , said at a news conference where he detailed the type of clues a bomber might have left			2
' importantly , the person who did this is someone 's friend , neighbor , co-worker or relative			0
' accusations : in a photo posted on both 4chan and @entity16 , a man wearing a blue coat is pictured with a backpack - with distinctive black and grey straps - dangling on his arm			1
a bag with similar straps is pictured at the scene of one of the bombings claims : as the @entity23 scours through thousands of photos of the moments before the @entity6 , various @entity16 and 4chan users are pointing out who they believe to be possible suspects speculation : in this photo , the @entity256 claim that a man can be seen dropping a suspicious object near the scene of the second explosion new crime scene photographs of the remnants of the first bomb which detonated during monday 's @entity35 marathon shows that a six - liter pressure cooker was used in at least one of the deadly charges - as experts described the devices as military - style ' anti-personnel ' devices			1
the images - released by the @entity272 - show the wreckage of a stainless steel pressure cooker with an @entity277 safety mark and an imprint that reads gas or electric , with experts describing the devices as military - style ' anti-personnel ' devices			0
furthermore , it is being claimed the deadly devices used were designed to act like ' homemade claymores ' - powerful , directional anti-personnel devices			0
the lid of a pressure cooker was found on a nearby rooftop and investigators were able to pinpoint which type of cooker was used			0
probe : investigators comb through the post finish line area of the @entity6 at @entity202 , two days after two bombs exploded just before the finish line one brand of pressure cooker with ' 6l ' on the bottom is made by the @entity301 company @entity300 , which sells about 50,000 of the six - liter pots in the @entity303 every year , the @entity296 reported			1
this gives investigators a real chance to narrow down their list of suspects - which they said yesterday was ' wide open ' - and find out who is responsible for the worst attacks on @entity303 soil since 9/11			2
they will use every clue , from the cooker 's manufacturer and retailers to the types of nails used in the shrapnel , to try and find out from where the bomb parts were purchased and by whom			0
@entity324 , a retired @entity326 agent who ­ developed the agency ’s explosives training program , said examiners are looking at scraps of the bomb components , bags and all other forensic evidence			0
he said : ' you ’re looking for a needle in a haystack , but the needle is there			0
if you look long enough , you ’ll get stuck with it			0
this is not an unsolvable crime			0

internet users turn detectives as they go through photographs from @entity6 to find anyone who may be involved
