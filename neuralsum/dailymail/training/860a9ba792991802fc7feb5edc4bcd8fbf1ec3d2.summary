by @entity0 published : 19:00 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 03:21 est , 8 november 2013 @entity1 just would n’t be @entity1 without mince pies , roast turkey , crackers … and a tear - jerking advert from @entity6			1
the department store has long made it its mission to convert even the most avowed @entity10 , and this year is no exception			0
the £ 7million @entity13 - inspired advert , which makes its tv debut tomorrow , tells the story of a selfless hare who is determined to make sure his best friend , a bear , does n’t miss @entity1 for once			1
the commercial features the tale of two good friends , a bear and a hare , who are sad at the thought of being separated for @entity1			1
the store has used hand drawn animation to tell the story with the result the commercial looks very much like a classic @entity13 film from the 1940s , such as @entity52 , which has been watched by generations of children			1
the technique taps in to feelings of nostalgia , while it also tells a heart - warming story which , based on past experience , will have many in tears			1
looking for a place to rest : so the bear treks through the wilderness to find a likely spot ... @entity1 is coming : while the bear sleeps , the other woodland animals get on with decorating the tree the tale opens as winter is starting to draw in and the fun and excitement of preparing for @entity1 begins			1
as the first snowflake falls and lands on the bear ’s nose , the hare starts to feel sad because he realises his friend will soon go off to hibernate , so – as usual - missing @entity1			1
while the bear is keen to join in , eventually he finds he can not hold off his winter sleep any longer and disappears into his cave			0
viewers see the bear fast asleep while all the other woodland creatures become excited about the big day to come			0
sad : the hare fears that the bear is missing out , so he comes up with a bright idea best friends : carrying a gift , the hare follows the bear into the wilderness where he is in hibernation however , the hare is missing his friend and finds it increasingly difficult to join in the preparations until the moment he has a great idea for a very special present			1
he disappears off in to the wilderness to return with the gift – an alarm clock – which wakes the bear just in time to gather around a beautifully decorated tree to celebrate with all his friends			0
the commercial , which carries the strapline ‘ give someone a @entity1 they ’ll never forget ’ , is the first for the chain to use hand drawn animation			2
a spokesman said : ‘ the story evokes the excitement of a first @entity1 and the importance of friendship and thoughtfulness			2
’ christmas gift : the hare leaves the bear a mystery gift - an alarm clock tearjerker : the alarm clock means that for the very first time the bear is awake for @entity1 the songs linked to @entity6 commercials , which generally involve a new take on much loved hits from the past , have been central to the success of its campaigns			1
last year , the commercial featured a snowman ’s determined trek to find his loved one a perfect gift to a version of @entity146 by young @entity148 singer , @entity147			0
heading for number one ? @entity150 has recorded a cover of @entity152 's @entity153 for the advert this year , @entity150 is performing a version of the @entity152 ’s 2004 hit ‘ @entity153 ’			1
it is something of a coup for the singer , who stepped out of the limelight in 2010 , effectively walking out on a highly successful career , to have children			0
the singer and husband @entity163 married in @entity165 and had their first child @entity166 in november 2011 , who was followed by @entity169 in january this year			0
it is known that the much missed 28 - year - old has been in the recording studio working on an album to be released in the @entity174			0
the song from the @entity6 commercial seems certain to be the perfect springboard for her come back			2
@entity6 has outperformed the rest of the high street since the emotive advertising series was first launched at christmas 2009			2
that year , children were seen playing with gifts and morphing into adults to a folk version of the 1987 @entity186			0
the 2010 @entity1 offering included a version of @entity190 ’s @entity189 by @entity191			2
it subsequently topped the charts and was chosen by the @entity194 and @entity195 as the music for their first dance as man and wife			0
last year : @entity1 2012 's @entity6 advert featured a snowman 's trek to find the perfect gift for his loved one moving : 2011 's ad saw @entity206 performed a version of @entity208 ¿ please , please , please let me get what i want ¿ two years ago , slow moving @entity206 performed a version of @entity208 ‘ please , please , please let me get what i want ’			1
apart from building a relationship with shoppers , the campaigns have been instrumental in generating sales			0
one study suggested they have increased sales by more than £ 1billion over two years			0
