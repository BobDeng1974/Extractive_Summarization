they once bustled to the soundtrack of thousands of soldiers working towards establishing security in a war zone			0
but @entity6 military bases in @entity7 are fast becoming ghost towns as @entity6 continues to withdraw virtually all of its troops by december 31			1
only 6,000 troops remain in the country - down from a peak of 170,000 at the height of the war in 2007			1
and of the 505 military bases set up during the eight - year mission , only four continue to have a handful of personnel			1
ghost town : @entity22 , 20 miles north of @entity23 in @entity22 , has become deserted in recent days following the mass exodus of @entity6 troops empty : buildings lie empty and vacant housing units are marked with ribbons as the drawdown continues , illustrated here at @entity22 @entity31 , in @entity32 ; @entity33 in @entity34 ; @entity35 near @entity36 ; and @entity37 in @entity38 are all shadows of their former selves			0
adder , once the largest base in southern @entity7 , will be the last to close when control is formally passed on to @entity7 â€™s @entity45			1
but it is expected to spring back into life when the @entity7 military begins operating a major air base there			1
the @entity6 is donating its seven - story control tower to the cause , along with equipment too worn down or too expensive to ship out			0
in @entity38 , @entity37 is now also barely inhabited			0
the hard - shelled tents constructed by the @entity56 and later used by @entity6 are empty , rows of commercial generators remain silent and the only tracks in the mud belong to animals			0
and @entity22 , 20 miles north of @entity23 in @entity22 , has only a few dwellers left			0
ribbons mark vacant housing units , and tanks lie discarded on dusty fields			0
the ending of the cyclical deployment of almost one million troops will today see @entity6 president @entity68 meeting @entity7 prime minister @entity69 at the @entity70			1
the pair , who have pledged to maintain strong ties after the troop withdrawal , will discuss the next phase of the relationship between their countries			0
hand me downs : equipment which is worn down or too expensive to ship back to the @entity6 will be given to the @entity7 derelict : soldiers left messages on discarded tanks at @entity22 , which will remain in @entity7 but the contours of the partnership between @entity87 and @entity23 remain murky , especially with @entity88 eager to assert influence over its neighbouring country			1
serious questions also remain about @entity7 's capacity to stabilise both its politics and security			1
the end of the war marks a promise kept for @entity68 , which is one the @entity70 is eager to promote			1
the meeting is expected to focus heavily on how the @entity6 and @entity7 will continue to cooperate on security issues without the presence of @entity6 troops			1
@entity7 leaders have said they want @entity6 military training help for their security forces but have been unable to agree on what type of help they would like , or what protections they would be willing to give @entity6 trainers			2
the @entity70 said @entity68 and @entity69 would also discuss cooperation on energy , trade and education			2
they will hold a joint news conference at the @entity70 , before laying wreaths at @entity117 , where some of the nearly 4,500 @entity6 killed in the @entity7 war are buried			2
empty : @entity22 consists of 1,000 buildings , with only a handful of them now inhabited by a very small group of soldiers shadow : @entity22 used to hum to the sounds of humvees , now only a few cars take to its dusty streets each day looming over the talks are concerns among @entity6 officials over how @entity7 's relationship with @entity88 will develop with a significantly smaller @entity6 presence in the region			1
@entity69 has insisted that @entity7 will chart its future according to its own national interests , not the dictates of @entity88 or any other country			2
but some @entity6 officials have suggested that @entity88 influence in @entity7 would inevitably grow once @entity6 troops depart			2
both countries have @entity144 majorities and are dominated by @entity144 political groups			0
many @entity7 politicians spent time in exile in @entity88 under @entity149 's repressive regime , and one of @entity69 's main allies - anti-american cleric @entity152 - is believed to spend most of his time in @entity88			2
@entity154 , director of the @entity155 at the @entity156 , said how @entity23 chooses to orient itself will significantly influence the future of @entity7 's relationship with the @entity6 drawdown : @entity6 navy crew fold their national flag as they prepare to hand over their base to @entity7 forces in @entity38 on december 1 loading up : troops getting ready to move out of @entity35 , near @entity167 , earlier this month he said : ' a lot of this really comes down to , what kind of role is @entity7 going to play in regional security ? ' is it going to be a place where bad people come and go , or is it going to play a role in calming down a region that needs some calming down ? ' the first hints as to how @entity7 will assert itself in the region may come from how it handles the troubles in @entity183 , where a bloody government crackdown on protesters has killed more than 4,000 people , according to the @entity187			2
the @entity68 administration has called for @entity183 president @entity189 to step down			1
but @entity7 has been much more circumspect , with @entity69 warning of civil war if @entity189 falls and abstaining from @entity193 votes suspending @entity183 's membership an imposing sanctions			0
those positions align @entity7 more closely with @entity88 , a key @entity183 ally			0
the @entity6 has warned @entity7 's neighbors that even though @entity6 troops are leaving , the @entity6 will maintain a significant presence there			0
even though the war is ending , the @entity6 will maintain a large presence in @entity7			0
about 16,000 people are working at the @entity6 embassy in @entity23 , making it @entity6 's largest mission around the world			0
meeting : @entity6 president @entity68 ( left ) will meet with @entity7 prime minister @entity69 ( right )			1

only 4 camps out of 505 remain ; 6,000 soldiers down from 170,000 peak
president @entity68 set to meet @entity7 pm in @entity87
