by @entity0 published : 08:29 est , 28 february 2014 @entity2 : 08:30 est , 28 february 2014 plenty of people are guilty of quickly judging people based on their appearance or accent			0
and now scientists have found that we trust strangers with easier - to pronounce names			1
simpler and more easily recognisable names make people come across as more familiar and less risky to know , according to a new study			2
simpler and more easily recognisable names make people come across as less risky to know , according to a new study			2
people meeting strangers for the first time ( illustrated ) are more likely to trust claims made by people with easily pronounceable names adults with attractive faces are more likely to win the trust of children , psychologists have said			1
scientists tested 32 four and five - year - olds who were shown 12 photos of women aged between 18 and 29			0
both boys and girls tended to believe answers assigned to pictures of pretty women , according to the study that was published in october last year			0
lead researcher dr @entity39 , from @entity40 in the @entity41 , said : ' when learning about the world , children rely heavily on information provided to them by other people			0
' previous studies have shown children can be influenced by a range of factors such as whether the adult was correct in the past or if they are familiar to them			0
researchers at the @entity54 , found that people who speak @entity58 trust strangers with easier - to - pronounce names more than those with names that are more difficult to say – even when those strangers are from the same country			1
people are more likely to trust claims made by strangers with straight - forward names , they said			1
the scientists created fictitious pairs of names from different parts of the world , including the @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 , making sure that one name was easy to pronounce and the other more difficult			2
they then examined people ’s responses to the name pairs			0
in one experiment , participants imagined they were tourists looking for a reliable tour guide , while in another test , they were asked to decide how dangerous each person on a list of strangers was , based on nothing but their name			0
‘ in each experiment , strangers with easy - to - pronounce names were judged as being more familiar , more trustworthy and safer , ’ said @entity88 , a postdoctoral fellow in the university ’s @entity89			1
researchers at the @entity54 , found that people who speak @entity58 trust strangers with easier - to - pronounce names more than those with trickier names - even when those strangers are from the same country people with easily - pronounceable names enjoy a variety of benefits , according to a number of scientific studies			1
they perceived as more likable , more electable and more accomplished			2
people trust strangers with simple names as they come across as being more familiar and less risky to know			1
people are more likely to trust claims made by strangers with straight - forward names			1
‘ but what was most surprising is that the pronunciation of names had effects that extended beyond the name			0
' people actually thought claims attributed to easy - to - pronounce names were more likely to be true , ’ she said			1
according to the study that was published in the journal @entity121 , the assertion that ‘ macadamia nuts are in the same evolutionary family as peaches ’ was more believable when attributed to ‘ @entity126 ’ than when it was credited to his countryman ‘ @entity130			0
’ dr @entity131 explained that the phenomenon is n’t confined to people ’s names			2
‘ when we encounter new information , how easy or difficult it is to process plays an important role in all sorts of situations			0
for example , research shows people think that food additives with easier names are safer than those with difficult names			2
’ she thinks that the feeling of familiarity in the brain signals something we can trust , but information that is hard to process , signals danger			0
the study builds upon previous findings on the wide range of benefits enjoyed by people with easy - to - pronounce names , such as being perceived as more likable , more electable and more accomplished .			1
