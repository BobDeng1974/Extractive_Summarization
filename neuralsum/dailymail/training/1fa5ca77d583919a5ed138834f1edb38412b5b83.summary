@entity0 have had a year to remember as they sit at the peak of the @entity3 table during the @entity5 break			1
the @entity7 giants have won their last 22 consecutive games in all competitions with @entity10 chipping in with 10 goals in those encounters			0
therefore many would n't be too aggrieved at the @entity0 players for wanting to take a bit of a break over the festive period ... but @entity10 does not plan on stopping			1
@entity10 took to his @entity17 account to post a picture of him doing some night time training on tuesday @entity10 ( right ) celebrates with current team - mate @entity20 during the @entity21 semi-final looking rather chilly as he posted a picture to his @entity17 on tuesday night , @entity10 said : ' enjoying the @entity5 period , and a bit of late night training			1
got to stay on this winning streak ! ! ' since his £ 85million move from @entity30 , the 25 - year - old has already won four trophies in his time at the @entity7 club - the @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and , this week , the @entity21			0
that said , his efforts to remain on top of his game may not be fully appreciated by everybody at the @entity42 , with 54 % of fans saying they would happily see the @entity45 star sold to the highest bidder			0
with @entity0 supporters supposedly happy to let @entity10 leave if a bid of more than € 150million was tabled , and @entity50 reportedly sniffing around , maybe @entity47 is keeping a close eye on @entity10 's efforts			2
@entity10 ( left ) scored against @entity50 in his time at @entity30 , but could soon be playing for them at @entity55			0
