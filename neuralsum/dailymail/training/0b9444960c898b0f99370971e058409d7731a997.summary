by @entity0 follow @ @ lauriewhitwell it was @entity2 ’s unlikely hurrah and the away goals rule which did for @entity4 in @entity5 last season , but as they approach the beginning of a new campaign in which they will once again target @entity13 glory , a more fundamental obstacle lays in their way			1
the @entity17 champions , enhanced by the untold wealth of @entity19 since 2011 , were sanctioned similarly to @entity20 for breaching @entity5 ’s financial fair play regulations and have had to tailor their moves in the transfer market accordingly			1
when winning the continent ’s premier club title by 2016 has been the stated target all along , it was unsurprising to hear club president @entity28 call the punishment a ‘ tremendous handicap ’			2
@entity47 ’s team have won the last two @entity83 crowns , finishing ahead of @entity84 at a canter last season by nine points , and with @entity89 ’s other mega-wealthy side losing @entity90 to @entity91 this summer it seems a formality the domestic title will once more head to the capital			1
but it is in the @entity13 where the owners want success , explaining why @entity4 paid a staggering £ 50m for @entity32 , who won the trophy with @entity53 in 2012			1
‘ to be clear -- the players i want , i 'll have them , ’ @entity28 had also said			0
@entity32 joins @entity102 , who moved from @entity71 last summer , in a rather costly @entity104 centre back pairing			1
such a purchase may seem to fly in the face of the financial regulations but it should be their only large cash signing this window			2
@entity114 defender @entity113 has signed from @entity115 on a season - long loan with an option to make the move permanent , circumventing the transfer cap for this season			2
a similar arrangement could also bring @entity123 winger @entity122 from @entity91 to @entity50			0
@entity73 , signed for £ 20m from @entity72 in january , is another addition to the squad which started last season ’s @entity13 with a 4 - 1 win at @entity128			2
even more domestic success : @entity37 lifts the @entity17 season - opening @entity130 in @entity132 back in business : after a summer with no @entity136 the @entity135 striker is back in form at his club desire : @entity44 wants to play a central role but @entity37 's presence makes it difficult for the @entity143 working it out : @entity47 should have no trouble retaining the domestic title but @entity5 is another matter in action : @entity113 has arrived at the club on loan after a good @entity136 with the @entity114 2010 - 11 : @entity152 round of 16 - lost 2 - 1 to @entity153 2011 - 12 : @entity152 group stage - finished third behind @entity155 and @entity156 on goal difference 2012 - 13 : @entity13 quarter final - lost on away goals ( 3 - 3 ) to @entity159 2013 - 14 : @entity13 quarter final - lost on away goals ( 3 - 3 ) to @entity53 the conundrum for @entity47 was always how to fit £ 53m man @entity44 with star performer @entity37 , who cost £ 31m in 2012			1
the @entity162 was upset at playing out wide while the @entity163 plundered 40 goals in all competitions and has been consistently linked with a move away			0
@entity44 , who scored 16 league goals in his debut campaign , said last week that he would be staying but he added : ‘ it is important for an attacker to play in a position that is natural for him			1
everyone knows what my position is and there is no point talking about it again			0
’ @entity37 will see this as an important season too however			1
he turns 33 in october and perhaps this is his final opportunity to win the trophy he and his club covet most			0
he scored both @entity4 goals against @entity185 to win @entity89 ’s curtain - raising @entity130 in @entity132 last weekend – one a long - range screamer – and in a poll for @entity189 , 65 per cent said he would be the top scorer for the third year running			2
@entity4 sign @entity32 , @entity33 not following expensive assets : £ 50million @entity32 is greeted by @entity37 upon arriving in @entity50 with his new club real quality : @entity64 trains with @entity70 and @entity37 during pre season decisions to make : @entity47 has had great success on @entity17 soil , now it 's time to beat @entity199 and win in @entity5 but despite all the silverware that had followed @entity202 gold , @entity37 knows the main objective			1
‘ to do better than last season , ’ he said			2
‘ we had a fantastic season winning three trophies			0
we are focused on keeping this project growing and moving forward			0
‘ there is pressure on us but the players who are here are used to that			0
to say that we are a great team is not enough			0
we have to prove it on the field			0
’ @entity4 start the season on friday night with a match away at @entity218 but @entity32 , @entity64 and @entity219 have not featured in pre-season following the @entity136 , and @entity73 , @entity221 and @entity68 are also behind schedule			1
‘ the beginning of the season is as complicated as it was last season , ’ said @entity47			1
‘ we will try not to give up too many points on the road but i 'm happy with what the players have done so far			0
’ to be truly satisfied , success further afield must follow			0
on their way back : @entity68 is one of a number of the squad set to miss the start of the season bring it on : @entity237 and @entity37 will hope the lack of spending wo n't impede them			1

@entity4 start their @entity17 title defence at @entity218 on friday
@entity17 champions are almost nailed on for the domestic title again
but they have had problems in @entity5 and lost to @entity53 last campaign
now they face harsh @entity199 *restrictions* that also plague @entity20
they *receieved* a £ 49million fine , could not increase their wages for two years and were told to ' significantly limit ' their transfer spending
@entity32 's £ 50m arrival is the only big *fee* paid this summer
@entity47 must find way to utilise @entity37 and @entity44
@entity4 start their season without some of their @entity136 stars
