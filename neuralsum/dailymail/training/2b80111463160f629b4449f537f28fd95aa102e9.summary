a dramatic rise in killer attacks by dolphins on porpoises ( shown ) is baffling scientists in one of @entity7 's main breeding seas			1
the calm waters of @entity9 have been turned red in recent weeks by bottlenose dolphins killing smaller porpoises during deadly clashes the harbour porpoise ( @entity24 ) , which has been the subject of the dolphin attacks , is one of six species of porpoise			1
it is one of the smallest marine mammals and typically stays close to the coast or in river estuaries			0
the creature gets its name from @entity36 , which means pig fish			0
harbour porpoises have been known to dive 720 feet ( 220 metres ) and can hold their breath for up to five minutes			0
up until 2008 , scientists were baffled about why quite large numbers of the small marine mammals were found dead - and the @entity45 navy was even blamed for scores of dead porpoises in @entity48			2
but then tell - tale teeth marks were identified and examinations of the harbour porpoises ' bodies revealed broken ribs , imploding lungs and internal bleeding , from prolonged dolphin attacks , @entity49 reported			1
most cases of the attacks have been documented along the east coast of @entity61 and off the coast of @entity48			0
researchers at the @entity64 ( @entity64 ) said they have always known dolphins attack porpoises , but that the frequency of recent attacks is alarming			1
volunteers at @entity64 , in @entity70 , @entity71 , rescued a porpoise stranded on the beach in may after being chased by dolphins			0
last month researchers witnessed three dolphins killing a porpoise - with another fatal attack a week later			2
then last week three dolphins spent 20 minutes brutally attacking a porpoise close to the centre 's research vessel			0
the bottlenose dolphins repeatedly pounced on the porpoise , forcing it underwater then throwing it in the air close to the boat			0
' one of the dolphins in particular was attacking the porpoise while the others joined in from time to time , ' said researcher @entity91			0
' although we were close by , they took no notice of us , intent on the attack			0
' the crew pulled the porpoise 's battered body on board their research vessel and found blood coming from its mouth - suggesting it may have had punctured lungs or other internal injuries			0
@entity9 is home to @entity108 's largest resident population of dolphins - who share the sheltered waters with smaller harbour porpoises			1

pictured is another dolphin attack scientist @entity133 said she had been left baffled by the recent spate of deadly attacks			2
' one possibility is that they see the porpoises as competitors for food , especially if there 's a shortage of prey in the area , ' she said			1
' although porpoises normally go for smaller prey , dolphins will eat anything			2
' however there 's been no other indication recently of any shortage			0
' another theory is that a low number of females is prompting the attacks by males			1
male dolphins have been known to kill young dolphins in order to mate with the calf 's mother			0
porpoises are similar in size to a dolphin calf			2
the centre said it is unclear which dolphins have been responsible for the attacks			2
ms @entity133 added : ' one animal we 're familiar with , @entity171 , a female , was seen in the area when we rescued the porpoise last month , and she was also seen nearby in last week 's attack			0
' our records show that she 's been seen before with the animals we think were responsible for the attack , so it may even be that she 's teaching the others			0

dramatic rise in fatal dolphin attacks on porpoises has left scientists puzzled
the attacks have been *occurring* at @entity9 in @entity10 for weeks
three out of four of the brutal attacks on the porpoises have been fatal
one *explanation* could be a shortage of prey in the area , with porpoises being seen as competitors to the dolphins
a low number of females could also be making males more violent
