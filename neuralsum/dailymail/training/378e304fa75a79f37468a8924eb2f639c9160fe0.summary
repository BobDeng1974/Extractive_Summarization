by @entity0 when somebody asked artist @entity2 to show them his body of work , he took the request rather literally			1
never one to turn down the chance to suffer for his art , the @entity8 performance artist had one of his own ribs removed - and wore it as a necklace			2
in order to perform the operation , held under the supervision of a doctor , he cut a metre - long gash from his neck to his thigh , and filmed it on a camera			0
incredibly , he underwent the entire procedure without any form of anaesthetic			0
body of work : in order to perform the operation , @entity2 performed under the supervision of a doctor , he cut a metre - long gash , from his neck to his thigh , and filmed it on a camera the scarred way : he wears the rib in his studio in @entity36 , left , before showing the scar he got when performing the artwork @entity8 blogger and art consultant @entity39 described the oeuvre , called ' one - meter democracy ' , on her blog			1
she wrote : ' before the execution of this operation , there was a pseudo-democratic voting procedure			0
' ' according to the artist @entity49 [ sic ] , the vote was under the guise of a democratic process to decide whether he was going to perform his work or not … the result was 12 votes in favor of the work and ten against , with three abstentions			0
' that 's when the gruesome procedure began			2
body tension : he said the work , called ' @entity64 ' was intended to highlight the ' tension between the individual and the state ' in @entity68 public vote : he named the work ' one - @entity64 ' after cutting a metre from his neck to his thigh after asking 25 people in the room to vote on whether he should do it or not ' artistic performance can be distinguished from everyday life only when it is given a certain intensity , ' he said after the performance			1
' i want my work to move people			2
' he added that the work was designed to highlight the ' tension between the individual and the state ' in @entity68			1
born in 1967 , he is now one of @entity68 's leading performance artists , known for performances designed to test his strength and endurance			1
previous works include casting himself inside concrete for 24 hours , trying to ‘ cut a river in half ’ with his own blood while suspended from a crane			0
strong art : born in 1967 , he is now one of @entity68 's leading performance artists , known for performances designed to test his strength and endurance he says : ' i feel that @entity68 is a very complex society , one in which it is important to use your body and your intellect so you can stop and face its reality ' he says : ' i feel that @entity68 is a very complex society , one in which it is important to use your body and your intellect so you can stop and face its reality			1
' highlighting the body in this way , as separate , is also important because , historically @entity8 people have not endowed the physical body with value , rather they have valued the spirit of the @entity8 people , as a collective			0
' @entity68 is much more individual in its thinking , so it ’s a pull between the two			2
by putting pressure on an idea about myself ( my intellect ) and my own body , i can make it into something much larger			0

@entity2 is one of @entity68 's most *famous* performance artists
