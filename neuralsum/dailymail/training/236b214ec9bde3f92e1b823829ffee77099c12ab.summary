by @entity0 about 250 @entity3 workers will lose their jobs at the car manufacturer 's @entity6 and @entity7 factories , it has been revealed			1
the @entity9 have confirmed to @entity10 these redundancies were a long time coming , with @entity3 flagging jobs were at risk earlier this year as car sales decline			1
it comes just over a year after @entity3 announced the two factories would close its doors in 2016			1
the job losses come after @entity27 and @entity28 announced in december and february respectively they would both cease @entity30 operations by 2017			1
it follows six years of struggle for the auto industry since @entity34 closed its @entity36 plant in 2008			0
regional secretary of the @entity9 vehicle division @entity39 said they had been in talks with @entity3 since march			1
' they have been pretty transparent			0
obviously it ’s a sad day , ' he told @entity45 on thursday			0
' the employees they have are highly skilled and dedicated employees			0
' i ’ve had a couple of discussions with @entity3 management and they ’re upset too , but it ’s a fact of life and there ’s nothing we can do about it			2
' mr @entity39 said the car manufacturer cited declines in sales of its @entity61 and @entity62 ranges as the reason for the job losses			1
' the @entity62 is the one that has taken the most hits on the marketplace , ' he said			0

' @entity3 announced last year it close its doors at @entity7 and @entity6 on @entity30 shores by 2016 mr @entity39 said @entity75 had helped employees look for other jobs by holding career fairs to help those who were made redundant			1
' some have taken the opportunity to pick up a job with a new employer , ' he said			2
' if there are opportunities rising out of the jobs fair that will suit individual then they will take it instead of @entity3 having to tap ( people on the shoulder ) and forcibly make them redundant			2
' so far about 50 people have put their hand up for a redundancy package as the june 20 deadline looms			1
declines in sales of the @entity61 and @entity62 are to blame for the forced redundancies the @entity98 , who were tasked with looking into the auto industry , tabled its preliminary findings report and found car manufacturers in @entity30 were not meeting the annual production of 200,000 to 300,000 vehicles to make them financially viable			0

' top selling models enjoy sales of only a little over 40,000 vehicles a year			0
' the commission also said jobs in the industry decreased by 40 per cent between 2006 and 2013 , with only 44,000 employed in 2013			0
