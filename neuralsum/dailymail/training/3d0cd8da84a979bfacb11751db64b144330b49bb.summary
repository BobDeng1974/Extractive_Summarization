but researchers have today suggested that drivers using hands - free kits could pose almost as much of a safety risk as those illegally holding their mobile to their ear			1
a @entity14 study found that drivers using hands - free devices were significantly more likely to make a host of potentially hazardous errors - from speeding to switching lanes without indicating - than drivers not talking on the phone			1
not as safe as you think ? researchers in @entity14 say hands - free devices that allow people to talk at the wheel can still increase the risk of driver error sales of hands - free phone devices have soared in the @entity33 in recent years since it became against the law to use a mobile phone normally while driving			1
the law banning drivers and motorcyclists from using hand - held phones or similar devices came into force ten years ago			0
the possible punishments for drivers or riders caught using their mobile range from a £ 60 fixed penalty and three penalty points , to being disqualified from driving and issued with a maximum fine of £ 1,000			0
the only instances in which drivers are allowed to use their phone are if they need to call 999 in an emergency and it is unsafe or impractical to stop , or if they are safely parked			0
drivers are permitted to use hands - free kits , sat navs and two - way radios while driving or riding , but could still face a penalty should they be stopped by police who deem them to be distracted and not in control of their vehicle			1
it was thought that using a hands - free device significantly cut the risk of driver error , when compared to holding a phone to the ear			2
but the new study found that drivers using a hands - free phone made significantly more errors - such as crossing a centre line , speeding , or changing lanes without indicating first - compared to those not using a phone			1
a study led by professor @entity82 , of the @entity83 in @entity14 , showed the jump in errors also corresponded with a spike in heart rate and brain activity			2
researchers looked at the brain activity of 26 participants who completed a driving course using a driving simulator			0
participants were first tested in a ' control ' condition - using the simulator to drive through virtual city streets while using no telecommunications device			0
they were then tested again while talking on a hands - free device			2
the drivers were engaged in two - minute conversations that avoided emotionally charged topics			0
danger : sales of hands - free kits soared after it became illegal to use a mobile phone in the usual way while behind the wheel researchers found there was a significant increase in brain activity while talking on a hands - free device compared with the control condition			1
prof @entity82 said : ' the findings also indicated that blood flow to the brain is significantly increased during hands - free telecommunication in order to meet the oxygen demands of the neurons under the " distracted " condition			2

study shows hands - free devices lead to sharp increase in driver errors
users more likely to speed or *suddenly* change lanes , researchers say
*academics* in @entity14 *monitored* the brain activity of drivers
