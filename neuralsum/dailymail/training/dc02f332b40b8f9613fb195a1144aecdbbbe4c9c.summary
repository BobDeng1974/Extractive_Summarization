it ’s the most wonderful time of the year on @entity1 - but it seems the universe , too , knows how to throw a good festive party			2
a stunning image released by @entity5 has shown a kaleidoscope of colour as two colliding galaxies put on a spectacular light show			1
but while impressive to look at , the image also has scientific value - revealing a large number of super-bright sources of x-rays that may indicate a new type of black hole			2
scientists in @entity18 and @entity19 have revealed a spectacular light show taking place in two colliding galaxies ( shown )			1
the galaxies in question are @entity25 and @entity25 , which are 130 million light - years from @entity1 in @entity26 the two galaxies in the image , @entity25 and @entity25 , are located about 130 million light - years from @entity1 in the constellation of @entity26 , and together measure 180,000 light - years across			1
the image is a combination of data from three telescopes : the @entity34 , the @entity35 and the @entity36			0
colliding galaxies like the pair featured in the image are well known to contain intense star formation			1
shock waves , like the sonic booms from supersonic aircraft , form during the collision , leading to the collapse of clouds of gas and the formation of star clusters			0
in fact , researchers estimate that the stars associated with the ultraluminous x-ray sources ( @entity54 ) are very young and may only be about 10 million years old			1
in contrast , our @entity55 is about halfway through its 10 - billion - year lifetime			0
it was compiled by scientists from the @entity60 , the @entity61 in @entity62 and the @entity63 in @entity64 ( all in @entity18 ) , and the @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity19			1
@entity34 is used to spot x-rays coming from the galaxy , which appear pink in the image			0
the reason there is so much pink is that the galaxies contain one of the most numerous collections ever found of so - called ultraluminous x-ray sources ( @entity78 )			2
both galaxies , like our own @entity80 , contain a number of star systems called x-ray binaries			0
these consist of a star in a tight orbit around either a neutron star or a small black hole with about the mass of our sun - like the one seen in the movie @entity94			0
these systems emit a large amount of x-rays , but @entity78 - of which both galaxies have many - are far brighter			0
why they are so much brighter than regular x-ray binaries is not well understood , but it might be caused by a larger than normal black hole - an as yet unconfirmed medium - sized one - orbiting each star			2
in total 28 @entity105 have been spotted in the two galaxies			0
the pink colour in the image shows x-ray emissions from superbright sources ( shown up close ) , believed to be stars around black holes			1
intense regions of star formation are also revealed in the image , which uses data from three telescope the image is a combination of data from three telescopes : the @entity34 ( illustration shown ) , the @entity35 and the @entity36 elsewhere in the image , @entity35 ’s optical data appears in blue , white , orange and brown , while infrared data from @entity128 appears red			1
from the data , scientists have found a strong correlation between the number of x-ray sources and the rate at which stars are forming in any given region			1
in the spiral arms of the galaxies , for example , comparatively large amounts of stars are forming in similar regions to the @entity143			0
the correlation suggests the stars in the binary systems with black holes are young and massive , emitting huge amounts of radiation			1
in fact , such is the rate of star formation that 24 are predicted to be born each year			2
for comparison , our @entity80 spawns only about one to three new stars every year			0
elsewhere in the image , @entity35 ’s optical data appears in blue , white , orange and brown , while infrared data from @entity128 appears red			0
shown is a previous image @entity35 took of the colliding galaxies , with their positions mirrored			2
