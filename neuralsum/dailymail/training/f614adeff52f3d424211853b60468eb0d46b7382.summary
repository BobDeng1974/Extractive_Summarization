local government official @entity109 said the new centre , two miles from the ferry port , would be available for use within the ‘ coming days ’			2
he added : ‘ the cold weather plan will provide shelter for all those people left outside when temperatures fall			0
‘ we need a space that can house around 1,500 people , that they can reach on foot , but one that is not in the town centre , because encouraging migrants to remain in the town centre is a sensitive issue in @entity85			2
