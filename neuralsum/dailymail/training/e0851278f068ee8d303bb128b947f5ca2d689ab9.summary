a cat - loving couple from @entity2 are just days away from opening the country 's first ever cafe where consumers can dine - in with fury felines			2
@entity7 and @entity8 have been given the final approval to open their @entity11 coffee house , aptly titled @entity13 , which will effectively combine people 's affection for cats with a love of good coffee			1
the complex will include a purpose built area upstairs , above the cafe itself , which will permanently house 11 friendly - natured and well nurtured animals hand - picked from the owners themselves			0
the upstairs interior , where cafe - goers will be able to interact with animals , has been built to cat - friendly specifications and includes five rooms housing giant cat - climbing frames and carpeted shelves mounted to walls			1
visitors who want to interact with cats can pay $ 10 for the first hour and then $ 5 for every half an hour			2
there are rules around interacting , such as not feeding them or waking them if they 're asleep , but there 's no limit to the amount of time someone can spend with them			0
mrs @entity69 said while there had been a lot of ' back and forth ' in getting the project up and running , she was always confident the ' @entity74 - inspired ' business would get off the ground			0
she said the idea came to her and husband @entity8 after visiting a @entity79 cafe similar to the one they are proposing			1
after returning to @entity2 and becoming dissatisfied with their jobs , they decided to see if starting their own cat cafe was feasible			2
mrs @entity69 said she found a gap in the market , but was faced with the biggest hurdle of overcoming various ' unprecedented ' health and safety requirements because no such business in @entity2 existed			0
having successfully jumped through legal hoops , finding a suitable site and convincing a willing landlord , the pair will open the cafe on july 30			1
the idea of the cat cafe first came from a trip @entity99 and mrs @entity69 took on their honeymoon to @entity79 , where they visited a cat cafe similar to the one they are proposing the aim of the cafe is to give people who ca n't own pets due to certain apartment or dwelling restrictions , the opportunity to interact with the animals ' the permission for the animals depended on the landlord , and when we struck an agreement , the next challenge came from the city council , ' she said			1
' because it was a first in @entity2 , they had to create strict regulations for us so there was a lot of back and forth			0
among the terms of the deal was that cats where to be kept strictly kept on - site , and that they could n't be ' adopted ' out .			0

the @entity13 will open on july 30 at *375* @entity132 , @entity11
it is @entity2 's first @entity13 where people can pay to interact with cats
the idea came to owners @entity7 and @entity8 during a trip to @entity79
five rooms will be *equipped* with climbing frames and carpeted shelves
