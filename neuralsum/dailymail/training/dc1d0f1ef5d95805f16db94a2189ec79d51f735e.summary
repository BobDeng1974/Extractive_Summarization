@entity0 moved straight to the top of @entity2 with a win over woeful @entity4 and @entity5 moved to within three goals of @entity9 ’s all - time @entity8 scoring record			1
this was not @entity0 rediscovering the swagger that saw them brush aside @entity13 in last season ’s semi-final and beat @entity15 4 - 1 in the final but they still had far too much for last season ’s @entity18 champions			2
they took the lead as early as the 14th minute when right - back @entity23 made his first run into the @entity4 area and played the ball to @entity28 whose clever backheel allowed the full - back to continue his run and shoot at @entity32 in the @entity4 goal			1
via the chest of defender @entity35 the ball went past the keeper at his near post			0

goal : @entity81 37 referee : @entity92 ( @entity93 ) @entity0 were on top without being particularly convincing in those opening stages			1
@entity60 is learning on the job in @entity99 ’s defensive midfield position and he was guilty of giving the ball away twice in the first half in dangerous areas			0
against a better team the slips would have cost @entity0 dearly but @entity4 were weak in attack and leaky at the back			2
their defence – marshaled by 36 - year - old @entity73 who played briefly and unremarkably for @entity0 ten years ago – looked vulnerable to every attack and soon @entity0 had a second goal			2
@entity41 ran on to @entity61 ’s pass and scored past @entity32			2
a minute later he turned provider as @entity5 moved to 68 @entity8 goals – just three behind @entity9 ’s all - time competition record			0
the goal flurry had been preceded by @entity62 running through in an offside position and missing his chance before a forgiving flag was raised – cue whistles and boos from supporters who were also vocal in their criticism of @entity56			0
@entity62 could have silenced the boos with a goal but instead shot straight at the keeper when played in by @entity5 and looked on as @entity28 tapped in the rebound for goal number four			1
@entity56 was being jeered and cheered in equal measure every time he took a goal - kick but the whistles intensified when he failed to keep out @entity81 ’ shot out just before half - time as @entity4 narrowed the margin			1
the 20 - year - old @entity131 could then have made it 4 - 2 but sent his volley over the bar			0
click here for your ultimate stats guide , including how @entity60 bossed the game from the middle of the park @entity41 lifts the ball high over @entity4 goalkeeper @entity32 before rounding him to score @entity0 's second goal of the night @entity41 tucks the ball into the empty net having lifted it over the @entity4 goalkeeper after being put through on goal by a magnificent @entity61 pass @entity148 @entity5 taps home into an empty net after being picked out by his @entity0 teammate @entity41 to make it 3 - 0 @entity5 wheels away towards @entity41 after converting the @entity155 's cross to make it three after half an hour watching @entity158 scouts would have noted defensive lapses at both ends with a bizarre overhead kick towards his own penalty area from @entity61 sending @entity164 through			1
@entity58 clattered into him and had the @entity4 forward gone down @entity58 , as the last man , would have walked but @entity164 stayed on his fit to miss the chance			0
@entity73 ’s night ended ten minutes into the second half when he was taken off and @entity58 was also withdrawn with @entity65 coming on			0
the @entity171 ’s first contribution was to head a @entity4 through ball on to @entity81 who should have made it 4 - 2			1
@entity56 spread himself and palmed the chance away to wild applause from those in the stadium who had earlier done their best to drown out the whistles directed at him			0
@entity41 and @entity5 celebrate together after their attacking brilliance had ripped the @entity18 side 's defence apart @entity52 slides home the fourth goal for @entity0 after @entity32 had parried a shot from striker @entity62 @entity4 's defence was unable to cope with the pace and quality of the @entity0 forwards as the champions romped into a four goal lead inside 36 minutes it was then time for @entity62 to exact some revenge on his critics rifling in the fifth off the underside of the cross bar before being substituted by @entity39 – still whistled by some home supporters despite the strike			1
the 5 - 1 scoreline slightly flattered @entity0 and @entity74 could have narrowed the margin when his shot came back off of @entity56 ’ left - hand post			2
@entity41 missed a chance to get his second when a shot from close range was palmed away by @entity32			0
but @entity0 had done enough to win the game , top group b and restore some the confidence that has recently been shredded by the sale of @entity211 and @entity99 and two defeats in three in the league			0
the @entity0 players walk back after scoring their fourth goal , their third in a seven - minute period of play that flattened the visitors @entity4 @entity56 makes a rare save as @entity4 were over-run by @entity0 's attacking quality			1
the @entity0 keeper was given no chance with @entity81 's goal @entity4 captain @entity80 holds his head in disappointment on what was a frustrating night for the @entity4 forwards who spent most of the night defending @entity62 enjoys the acclaim of the @entity229 after rounding off his performance with a goal , @entity0 's fifth of a very comfortable victory			1

@entity35 own goal puts @entity0 ahead after 14 minutes
@entity41 makes it 2 - 0 from *delightful* @entity61 pass
@entity5 adds the third from @entity41 cross after half an hour
@entity52 scores fourth after @entity62 has a shot parried
@entity81 pulls one back for @entity4 with *excellent* run and shot
