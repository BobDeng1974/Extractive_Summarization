mr @entity2 told a televised meeting in @entity10 today that he ' does n't see any reasons ' against the bill and said that he ' intends to sign it ' into law			0
the president said @entity6 authorities deny access to adopted @entity3 children and lets @entity6 suspected of violence towards @entity3 adoptees go unpunished			1
critics say that the bill will deprive many @entity3 orphans of an opportunity to get a family			0
the @entity3 parliament has voted for the bill , which is part of a larger measure by @entity28 retaliating against a recently signed @entity6 law calling for sanctions against @entity3 deemed guilty of human rights violations			1
@entity32 estimates that there are about 740,000 children not living with parents in @entity3 and only 18,000 @entity3 are now waiting to adopt a child			0
the move has angered some @entity3 who argue it victimises children to make a political statement , reports @entity41			0
@entity3 is the single biggest source of adopted children in the @entity6 , with more than 60,000 @entity3 children being taken in by @entity6 over the past two decades			2
should @entity2 ban @entity6 from adopting @entity3 children ? it is likely @entity2 's comments refer to @entity47 , a @entity3 toddler who was adopted by @entity6 and then died after his father left him in a car in extreme heat for hours in 2008			1
the father was found not guilty of involuntary manslaughter			0
the @entity53 says it regrets the @entity3 @entity55 's decision to pass the bill , saying it would prevent many children from growing up in families			2
@entity59 has called on @entity3 parliamentarians to reject the bill because it believes it have a ' chilling effect on @entity3 human rights defenders '			1
@entity64 and @entity66 director @entity65 said : ' this bill is frankly a childish response to the @entity69			2
' the @entity70 should be focusing its efforts on how it can strengthen @entity3 civil society , not weaken it			0
' @entity2 said the @entity73 had ' poisoned relations ' between the two countries loggerheads : @entity2 's actions are seen as a political move against the @entity6 for its recent law which allows sanctions against @entity3 accused of human right violations			1

@entity2 said he will sign the bill to prevent @entity6 adopting @entity3 children
it is seen as a tit **-** for **-** tat response to @entity6 bill that will *freeze* assets of @entity3 accused of human rights abuse
