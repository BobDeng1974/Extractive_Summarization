by @entity0 published : 06:18 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 07:44 est , 3 september 2013 wildlife photographer @entity1 spent 750 days in the harsh surroundings of the @entity3 to chronicle the life of a female leopard and in doing so delved into a dark and fascinating nocturnal world of big cats and other predators			1
through his incredible project , mr @entity1 , 41 , documented the struggle of @entity11 the leopard to raise cubs in one of the most punishing environments on earth , where big predators become more active at night , and when the photographer 's visibility is severely diminished			1
undeterred by the threat of the big cats , mr @entity1 spent thousands of hours in his jeep at night , capturing remarkable moments with @entity11 , a pride of lions , a pack of jackals and other predators			1
striking : the life of @entity11 the leopard was documented in stills by photographer @entity1 over a two - year period he also captured some stunning and often comical pictures of other creatures , bug and small , including colourful lizards and a pair of quizzical - looking owls			2
mr @entity1 travelled a colossal 100,000km during his time at the @entity40 in @entity41			2
the images , collected in his new book ' @entity44 of the @entity3 ' , capture the awe - inspiring beauty and breathtaking diversity of life in the region			2
shooting mostly at night , the @entity50 - born photographer had to brave night - time temperatures of -13 in the winter , while trying to catch up on his sleep in sweltering @entity55 heat in the day			2
' i have always been fascinated by leopards , and my dream was to follow and document a leopard raising cubs in this @entity3 hostile environment , ' @entity1 said			0
' there are few female leopards in the south of the park , and we started tracking one with a cub of 12 months old			0
@entity69 : filming @entity11 with her cubs was the highlight of mr @entity1 's two - year project immersed in the @entity3 , describing the special moments with the cubs as ' incredible ' framed : @entity11 was the focus of mr @entity1 's attention throughout the two years he spent in the desert , following her day and night , but she was most active at night ' she was not very accommodating , and took us at least three months to get used to us			1
she did n't have a tracking device so we had to track her the hard way			0
lots of hours in the bush			0
' the leopard , named @entity11 , had to protect her cubs from the park 's lions , cheetah , spotted hyenas , brown hyenas and jackals , all of whom will kill cubs on sight			2
the leopardess had three litters during the two years and three months she was trailed by @entity1			0
her middle two cubs were killed by a brown hyena , but she later gave birth to another two which survived			0
entertainment : during his two - year project , mr @entity1 was privy to a host of fascinating and often comical moments in the animal kingdom in the @entity3 , including this fox cub playing with a mouse baffled : these two owls appeared to be bemused and fascinated by an insect that scurried between them all creatures great and small : animals both large and small were snapped by mr @entity1 during his time in the @entity3 , including this tiny lizard ( @entity116 ) , snapped scuttling across the sand at night , and another lizard ( r ) captured balancing on a seed pod as it blew in the wind also , unusually for leopards , she was regularly joined by ' family man ' @entity123 , the father of all three litters			1
@entity1 was accompanied on his travels by his partner @entity128 , who did all the film work for the project			0
her video clips can be seen on the app that will be released at the end october to accompany @entity1 's images			0
first light : @entity11 had three litters of cubs throughout the two years she was photographed , the first and last set survived , the middle set of cubs were taken by hyenas predator : among the many predators in the desert that would eat @entity11 's cubs were the lions close up : fearless lions could easily take @entity11 's cubs is the opportunity arose high alert : @entity11 was alone in the desert protecting and feeding herself and her cubs ; the lions worked in a pride and there were always members on high alert for opportunities for food deadly : the roar of the lions and other greeting calls could be heard from miles across the desert during the day , the pride of lions would often rest - as would @entity11 - as the temperatures rose and the flies came out pack : a group of jackals also posed a threat , capable of taking @entity11 's cubs if hungry			1
here they fight over the remains of a carcass in the @entity3 , @entity41 as the sun set , the big cats , including @entity11 and her cubs and the lions , would seek out opportunities for food and mr @entity1 would begin taking his photos attentive : the striking looking female leopard scoured the desert when night fell searching for threats and opportunities for food asked to nominate his favourite moment from his two years in the @entity3 , @entity1 goes for his time photographing @entity11 's cubs			1
' they are amazing animals and incredible to photograph , we spent time at at least 12 different den sites , ' he added			0
snarl : a close - up of a leopard 's mouth shows a healthy set of sharp teeth to the camera dramatic : night time work produced some incredible shots , including this lioness trying to sleep as thunder storm raged nearby beneath a blanket of stars , one leopard was captured walking past a magnificent lone tree in the desert serene : a single owl flew into a stunning night - time landscape of the @entity3 , as lightning lit up the horizon silent : a lone leopard scans the vegetation from a rocky perch on a starry night , captured in this incredible time - elapsed photo of the night sky photographer @entity1 spent much of his time taking photos at night from his jeep while his partner @entity128 did all the film work for the project mr @entity1 's book ' @entity44 of the @entity3 ' chronicles the life of @entity11 the leopard and her struggle to raise her litters of cubs			1

wildlife photographer @entity1 spent two years in the @entity3 documenting nocturnal life of @entity11 the leopard
during that time he saw her have three litters , two of which survived , but one set was taken by a pack of hyenas
much of his work followed the leopard 's activity at night , when it was safer for her to move and hunt for food
during this time he also documented remarkable night - time pictures of lions , cheetahs , hyenas and jackals
the fascinating nocturnal animal world of the @entity3 has been collated in a new book produced by mr @entity1
