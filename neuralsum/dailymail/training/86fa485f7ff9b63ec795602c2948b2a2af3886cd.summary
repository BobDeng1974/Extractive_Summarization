' whilst the expedition leader and the school staff did everything they could on the ground to try to save him , they , along with our son , were badly let down and we hope the inquest will answer our questions as to why this happened			1
' mrs @entity83 told the court her son , who was studying maths and physics a levels , was an ' easy going , laid back young man ' who had previously stayed away at @entity188 with his friends in 2011			1
