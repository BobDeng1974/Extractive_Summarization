by @entity0 published : 12:14 est , 25 march 2013 updated : 12:36 est , 25 march 2013 visitors to @entity2 will again be able to experience standing inside the ancient stone circle thanks to a 360 - degree cinema			1
the battle for access to the @entity8 has been fought for many years , with campaigners wanting to be allowed into the world - famous monument			2
at last , protestors may partially get their wishes , as @entity14 is developing a solution - a virtual visit in a panoramic cinema			1
new evidence : studies of cremated human remains show that a larger stone circle was erected at the same site as a community graveyard the picturehouse will be the jewel in the crown of a new £ 27million centre and will include a 32ft landscape wall , on to which computer generated images of the countryside around the circle and other ancient earthworks will be projected			1
the new auditorium ’s 100ft circumference is smaller than the actual stone circle , which is around 300ft			1
it ’s expected to be built just over a mile from the stones			0
also planned are films providing information about the monument and prehistoric items , exploring theories over the uses of @entity2			1
outside the complex , replica @entity46 dwellings are being built , where tourists can find out how early inhabitants of the sites might have lived			0
the latest analysis of the remains of a @entity46 settlement near the monument show that thousands of people travelled from as far as @entity56 to the site , bringing their livestock and families for huge feasts and celebrations during the winter and summer solstices			2
the plans for the centre were revealed in a series of documents from @entity14 , which wants firms to provide the technological content for the audio visual displays , according to the @entity70			0
the documents describe the ‘ immersive 360 degree projected film ’ as the ' most important and high profile piece of audio visual ever undertaken by @entity14 '			1
@entity75 , the head of interpretation at the centre , said : ‘ it ’s meant to give people a sense of what it is like to stand in the middle of @entity2 because most people just wo n’t be able to do that			1
' it wo n’t feel like you are standing in a computer programme			0
the idea is to take our visitors back in time			0
’ solar power : people celebrate the sunrise at the @entity95 at @entity2 in @entity96 new studies of cremated human remains excavated from the site suggest that about 500 years before the @entity2 we know today was built , a larger stone circle was erected at the same site as a community graveyard , researchers said			1
‘ these were men , women , children , so presumably family groups , ’ @entity106 professor @entity105 , who led the team , said			0
‘ we 'd thought that maybe it was a place where a dynasty of kings was buried , but this seemed to be much more of a community , a different kind of power structure			0
’ the virtual visits may not win over all campaigners including @entity120 and @entity121 who want open access to @entity2 , which was created about 5,000 years ago			2
when it was first opened to the public , it was possible to walk among and even climb on the stones			0
however , they were roped off in 1977 due to problems with erosion			2
however , @entity14 does permit access during the summer and winter solstice , and the spring and autumn equinox			0
@entity134 researchers have proposed a new theory for the origins of @entity2 : it may have started as a giant burial ground for elite families around 3,000 b.c.			2

more than a million people visit @entity2 every year - but it has been roped off from the public since 1977
a new £ 27million centre nearby will contain a 360 - degree cinema screen with a 100ft circumference
