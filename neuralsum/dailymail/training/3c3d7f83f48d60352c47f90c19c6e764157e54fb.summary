internet users have the right to tell @entity4 to hide embarrassing details of their past in search results , @entity1 judges ruled yesterday			1
anyone will be able to ask the technology giant and other search engines to block any reference to information about their life			1
although content can not be removed from the internet altogether , the decision means it can be hidden from search results if it is ‘ inadequate , irrelevant or no longer relevant , or excessive ’			1
@entity4 ( pictured ) began removing search results last month and said it has received more than 70,000 requests since it put a form online on may 30 under the @entity28 , @entity27 includes the ‘ right to be forgotten and to erasure ’			1
under @entity27 17 , people who are mentioned in the data have the right to ‘ obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data			2
' this particularly relates to data about the person when they were a child , when the data is no longer relevant or necessary for the purpose it was collected , the person who owns the content withdraws their consent , the storage period has expired , or if it was gathered illegally			0
the @entity52 defines ‘ data controllers ’ as ‘ people or bodies that collect and manage personal data			1
’ the @entity56 means any data controller who has been asked to remove data must ‘ take all reasonable steps , including technical measures ' to remove it			1
if a data controller does not take these steps they can be heavily fined			0
it effectively enshrines in law the @entity68 doctrine of the ‘ right to be forgotten ’ , which says people should not be damaged by discussion of their mistakes or misjudgments in the distant past			2
the ruling by the @entity77 - based @entity76 yesterday provoked a wave of anger in @entity80			0
both privacy and freedom of expression watchdogs said it was a threat to free speech – condemning efforts to allow people to ‘ whitewash their personal history ’			2
influential @entity90 mp @entity89 added : ‘ this ruling is a draconian attack on free speech and transparency , totally at odds with @entity80 ’s liberal tradition			0
‘ it highlights the increasingly authoritarian dimension to the @entity52 , which threatens basic freedoms we have long taken for granted			0
’ the judgment came as an unwelcome surprise to ministers who have opposed @entity52 moves to establish a ‘ right to be forgotten ’			2
the government had been led to believe the @entity76 would reject yesterday ’s case when an adviser to judges last year said suppressing content in the public domain would affect the ‘ freedom of expression ’ of web publishers			1
but yesterday a board of 13 judges ruled that information could be suppressed even if it was ‘ true , accurate and lawfully published ’			0
the ruling was made by the @entity117 ( pictured )			2
it comes after a @entity120 man complained an online auction note about his repossessed home infringed his privacy			1
@entity4 told @entity124 it is ' disappointed ' by the ruling and argued it should not be a censor for data held on websites in its index in june 2013 , an adviser to @entity52 ’s highest court said that @entity4 should not have to remove personal information from its search results , even if that information is damaging to a person 's reputation			1
the statement was made by by advocate general @entity139 and was seen as a major blow against the ' right to be forgotten ' campaign			0
@entity139 said : ' requesting search engine service providers to suppress legitimate and legal information that has entered the public domain would entail an interference with the freedom of expression			0
' search engine service providers are not responsible , on the basis of the data protection directive , for personal data appearing on web pages they process			0
' they found in favour of @entity120 citizen @entity156 , who had demanded that @entity4 block links to newspaper reports dating back to 1998 about his social security debts			1
mr @entity156 told the court that the proceedings concerning him had been ‘ fully resolved for a number of years ’			2
judges said he had a right to suppress the information under a 1995 @entity52 data protection directive and the @entity52 ’s @entity167 , adding that his rights to privacy ‘ override , as a general rule , the interest of internet users ’			1
@entity4 was held responsible because , the judges decided , even though it is a @entity175 - based corporation , it has local sales offices in @entity120			2
the search giant said yesterday : ‘ this is a disappointing ruling for search engines and online publishers in general			1
we now need to take time to analyse the implications			0
’ @entity185 vice-president @entity184 , who is trying to persuade @entity52 nations to adopt a formal directive on the right to be forgotten , said the decision was a victory for privacy and would mean people could now ‘ manage their data ’			1
‘ companies can no longer hide behind their servers being based in @entity197 or anywhere else in the world , ’ she said			0
@entity200 of @entity201 said : ‘ the principle that you have a right to be forgotten is a laudable one , but it was never intended to be a way for people to rewrite history			0
’ @entity208 added : ‘ it allows individuals to complain to search engines about information they do not like with no legal oversight			1
‘ this is akin to marching into a library and forcing it to pulp books			0
although the ruling is intended for private individuals it opens the door to anyone who wants to whitewash their personal history			0

the ruling was made by the @entity117 ( @entity76 )
it came after a @entity120 man complained a listing infringed his privacy
he wanted an auction notice of his repossessed home to be removed
court found under @entity52 law , people have the right to control private data
@entity4 must now remove results , ‘ unless there are reasons not to ’
reasons include if the data is in the public interest , and whether the data is necessary to remain online for the use of other people
@entity4 told @entity124 : ' this is a disappointing ruling for search engines and online publishers in general '
