@entity0 said the @entity1 is ' has helped shape and define the @entity4 language ' the @entity5 has run into his second public funding row in a week after he was today forced to deny that his plan to send every school in @entity9 a copy of the @entity1 - at a cost of £ 377,000 - has run into trouble over funding			1
the prime minister had reportedly told @entity0 that while he supported the idea , he should avoid using taxpayers ' money , according to sources			1
it follows mr @entity0 's suggestion that a replacement for the @entity22 should be commissioned using taxpayers ' money to mark the @entity24			1
the @entity5 has yet to find a private sponsor for his project , with some @entity28 sources reported as saying he has been told he can not distribute the book until he does so			2
but mr @entity0 said talks were under way with a number of individuals and organisations that might ' share some of the burden ' - but the taxpayer would underwrite the cost			1
' the taxpayer is there to underwrite the costs but we are in conversation with a number of individuals and organisations that may share some of the burden , ' he said			2
mr @entity0 said the @entity1 was the most ' important book written in the @entity4 language ' and had major cultural and historical significance			1
he said a ' low cost ' deal had been struck with the publisher to provide the @entity1 - a move he described as a ' powerful and potent ' way of highlighting the historical significance of the anniversary			1
the bibles will be sent out to more than 20,000 schools to mark the 400th anniversary of it translation			1
it has been claimed thousands of copies may already have been printed and will be left in a warehouse without the funding , but @entity66 said it did not know if the copies had yet been printed , or where the copies might currently be stored			1
and they said the aim was to distribute the @entity57 to schools at @entity73 , so the timetable had not been affected by the lack of a sponsor and they would be distributed even if no sponsor is found			2
a senior education department source told the @entity81 enough public money was available for the scheme to go ahead , but no 10 had merely indicated that ' sponsorship was desirable '			1
but @entity28 sources said mr @entity0 was told that it would be wrong to spend nearly £ 400,000 on the project at a time when the government was in negotiations with teaching unions over cuts to their pensions			1
mr @entity0 's plan would see 20,000 schools receive a copy of the @entity1 a @entity66 official said in a statement : ' the prime minister was clear in his speech in december about the importance of the @entity1 , and marking this important anniversary			1
‘ the prime minister supports the plan to send a copy to every school			0
we continue to seek philanthropic sponsorship			0
' the third official translation of the @entity1 into @entity4 , also known as the @entity1 , was commissioned by the @entity109 @entity108 in 1604			2
it was completed by 54 scholars working on @entity113 and @entity114 manuscripts in @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117			0
it became the official version used by the @entity120 and was spread around the world along with the @entity122			0
but its popularity has also endured because of the poetry and the majesty of its language , with many of its original phrases entering popular conversation			0
among the most famous coinages in its 66 books are ' the powers that be ' , ' the apple of his eye ' and ' the @entity138 '			0
mr @entity0 said : ‘ it ‘ s a thing of beauty , and it ‘ s also an incredibly important historical artefact			1
it has helped shape and define the @entity4 language and is one of the keystones of our shared culture			0
and it is a work that has had international significance ’			0
the 400th anniversary of the publication of the @entity1 was in 2011.in a speech in december , mr @entity150 celebrated the importance of the @entity1 giving three reasons for its relevance			1
he said : ' the @entity1 has bequeathed a body of language that permeates every aspect of our culture and heritage			0
' second , just as our language and culture is steeped in the @entity1 , so too is our politics			0
' third , we are a @entity168 country			0
and we should not be afraid to say so			0
let me be clear : i am not in any way saying that to have another faith – or no faith – is somehow wrong			0
' government ministers have always been careful to avoid controversies surrounding religion with @entity177 's former communications chief @entity176 famously once declaring : ' we do n't do @entity179 '			2
but mr @entity0 said : ' it 's a thing of beauty , and it 's also an incredibly important historical artefact			1
it has helped shape and define the @entity4 language and is one of the keystones of our shared culture			0
and it is a work that has had international significance '			0
when the scheme was announced the @entity190 suggested that the @entity66 could put a message on its website and save ' tens of thousands of pounds '			2
@entity190 president @entity194 said : ' it 's not as if bibles are in short supply in schools			2
but if mr @entity0 intends to go ahead with this , will he also please ensure that a copy of on the @entity201 is sent out on @entity202 ? ' this book is much harder to find in schools and would be in line with his policy of promoting science and evidence - based education			1
i 'm sure that he could write an excellent foreword to this too			0
' @entity212 , campaigns officer at the @entity213 , added : ' either the government is funding this initiative itself at a time when it is making severe cuts elsewhere , or the @entity120 is finding it but using the government as a vehicle through which to promote @entity168 - both are unacceptable			2

@entity0 's second funding row in a week after suggesting the state should pay for a new @entity225
scheme is to mark the 400th anniversary of its translation
