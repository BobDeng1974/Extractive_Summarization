by @entity0 published : 07:01 est , 11 may 2012 updated : 20:29 est , 11 may 2012 a teenager weighing just six stone was wrongly diagnosed as an anorexic by doctors when she actually had a potentially deadly brain tumour			1
@entity5 , 19 , was suffering from severe headaches and sickness when she visited her gp in @entity9 , @entity10			1
at the time she had to wear clothes that normally fit an 11 - year - old , and her doctor mistakenly thought she had an eating disorder			2
when her symptoms failed to go away , miss @entity5 sought the opinions of other doctors and she was referred to a neurologist			1
changes : @entity5 weighed just six stone ( right ) when as a 15 - year - old she was wrongly diagnosed as an anorexic by doctors when she actually had a potentially deadly brain tumour			1
she is now healthy again ( left ) she was stunned to be told she needed an emergency brain scan , just days before she was due to fly to @entity25 on holiday			2
tests showed miss @entity5 had a malignant brain tumour the size of a 50p coin - and if she had flown on a plane , the air pressure would likely have exacerbated her condition			1
miss @entity5 underwent an operation to remove the tumour			1
she then endured two months of chemotherapy and radiotherapy , losing her long hair , before she was finally told that the treatment had been successful			2
her mother @entity40 , 41 , said : ' we initially got nowhere but all we ’re bothered about is seeing @entity5 eat again and to know that the tumour has gone			1
' doctors thought she had anorexia or bulimia and each time we went it was different			0
when the @entity8 said she had anorexia i just thought that a doctor ca n't be wrong so accepted it			0
' now she ’s having a brain scan every four months for two years , then every six months for three years , then every year for five years and then every five years after that			2
' there ’s still a way to go yet			0
' road to recovery : tests showed @entity56 , pictured with her mother @entity57 , had a malignant brain tumour the size of a 50p coin miss @entity5 was 15 and weighed 8.5 - stone when in december 2008 she began suffering from severe headaches and constant sickness			1
her doctor first said she suffered from migraines , then celiac disease and even bizarrely said she was ' standing up too fast '			0
she was finally diagnosed with anorexia in april 2009 after her weight dropped to just six stone			0
mrs @entity5 , who is her daughter ’s full - time carer , said : ' she complained of a bad headache and felt sick and was dizzy and i took her to the doctors			1
' we never saw the same doctor twice so we felt frustrated that we knew something was wrong and they talked to us like we were stupid and gave us painkillers			0
schoolgirl : miss @entity5 was wrongly diagnosed with anorexia in april 2009 after her weight dropped to just six stone ' they always said it may be this , it may be that - they never committed to anything			1
' they even said that she was dizzy because she was standing up too fast			0
to say that was disgusting			0
' the doctor was about to send her to a psychiatrist about having an eating disorder			0
' after months of feeling unwell , miss @entity5 started hiding being sick from her parents because she was ashamed and thought it was her fault			1
mrs @entity5 said : ' all her food came straight back up , she was n’t getting any nutrition at all			2
they even said that it may have been something she had eaten or she was allergic to something			0
' i was only after she had the operation and i helped her out the bath that i saw just how skinny she was			0
' they went to see another gp who sent her for cognitive and non-cognitive tests			2
mrs @entity5 said : ' the gp had a feel round @entity5 ’s neck and she said that she needed an emergency scan			1
that ’s when we said that we were going to go on holiday to @entity25 so they got us in for the scan the next day			0
' after the scan we were going to make another appointment and we got told to wait in the treatment room			0
then they came in and said , " you ’ve got a brain tumour			1
" we all had a big long cry			0
' miss @entity5 was admitted to @entity120 where she had an operation to remove the tumour			1
when she came round doctors said that they had taken out 99 per cent of the tumour ; the rest was destroyed by chemotherapy			2
she had to go through six weeks of chemotherapy and radiotherapy before a more intensive treatment called ‘ packer regime ’ - before her appetite came back with a vengeance			0
since the operation , miss @entity5 has had double vision in her eyes and has to have @entity136 injected into them to make them straight , and also has to have intensive physio to help her walk properly again .			2
