there is always that fear about cruising			2
who else will be on board ? will jumping into the sea be the only option when cornered by a double - glazing salesman struggling to meet his target ? the solution is to pick a ship full of enthusiasts bound by a common and familiar theme			2
better still , let the ship pick you			2
now and then : @entity14 with wife @entity15 ( left ) , and in his halcyon days captaining the @entity17 cricket team ( right ) that is what happened to my wife , @entity15 , and me			1
@entity22 has been running cricket cruises in the @entity24 for some years , and we have drifted in and out of most of them			1
this time , we were on for the duration - two weeks on @entity27 1 , which sits at the boutique end of cruising ( or ‘ yachting ’ , as they like to call it )			2
we were some 80 guests in total , including @entity33 columnist @entity32 - and @entity34 , with whom i played cricket through the @entity37			1
in those days , our accommodation on overseas tours lacked something compared to the luxuries and services of @entity27 - where we were never far from a rum punch			2
a little slice of paradise : @entity14 sailed aboard the @entity46 1 - a small ship perfect for the @entity24 my task as one of the hosts was simple			1
i had to be convivial with a mixed bunch of cricket lovers from all walks of life			1
when i was pretending to captain @entity17 in the mid-eighties , the @entity56 in @entity57 was a different beast			1
the ground was rebuilt for the 2007 @entity62 , and is now an excellent stadium			0
when the great @entity65 and @entity66 were blasting my bowlers to the boundary , the main stand looked like a long chicken shed			0
on this trip , three days of @entity71 cricket were more of an interlude to the rest of the voyage			1
the itinerary had us picking up the ship in @entity79 - from where we headed to @entity81 , @entity57 , @entity82 , @entity83 , the @entity84 ( the setting for some of the @entity88 films ) , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91			1
a place you might find difficult to leave : the cruise set sail from the sunshine island of @entity79 although @entity57 has been a building site for the past 30 years , it is still a favourite of mine			1
my advice it to head north towards @entity104 , where the pace is slower and the prices lower			0
this was a day off from our duties on board , and we lingered until we realised we were due to host a table back on @entity27 for dinner - something that is always an occasion			0
afterwards , those with unquenchable thirsts head to the top deck and the open - air bar for further refreshment			0
or , if the weather was not so fair , to the piano bar a deck below			0
either way , there ’s always someone with a cocktail shaker at the ready			0
our most outrageous meal was on @entity83 — at @entity125 and @entity126			1
what a day that was			0
@entity83 is not much larger than the big cruise liners so common in the @entity24			1
a different side of the @entity24 : @entity14 is especially fond of @entity104 , in the north - west of @entity57 we anchored off the beach , and were ferried ashore			1
the first treat was caviar and prosecco in the shallows just off the beach - with the crew , some still in uniform , and @entity140 , the ever - handy head sommelier , in his floral beach shirt , dispensing @entity143 caviar and blinis off a surfboard			2
no sooner had the big pot of @entity143 been emptied than it was time for a barbecue lunch , with the ship ’s chefs in full cry			0
this was a meal that needed working off , so in the afternoon it was time for beach cricket			1
i survived at the crease for an unusually long time , thanks to half the bowling not reaching my end , and because @entity160 was ruled out			0
now you must believe me when i say such a voyage is n’t just about the eating and drinking			2
the itinerary was structured so that a lot of the sailing between islands was done overnight			0
day job : @entity14 on commentary duties with fellow @entity17 cricket legend @entity171 ( left ) on several mornings , we were already anchored in the next gorgeous little bay by the time the alarm roused me from my slumbers			1
there were sun - loungers on the top deck ( and on the pool deck for those in need of @entity182 ) - and even indoor golf for those who have not , like me , sworn off the dreaded game			2
there were also quiet areas , a library with more than enough books for even the most anti-social traveller - and charts to show you where you ’d been - and were going next			0
inevitably , our two weeks disappeared all too quickly			0
but in that time , we renewed our friendships with those loyal @entity22 customers with whom we had travelled before - and we enjoyed the company of new faces			0
i hope to be invited back			0
this sort of cricket tour is one that i can take in my stride			2
@entity22 ( 01244 355 527 ; www.itcsports.co.uk ) offers a @entity24 package based around @entity17 ’s tour of the @entity204 in april 2015			1
prices from £ 2,995 per person for eight nights in @entity57 , including economy flights , welcome drinks , farewell dinner , @entity212 manager and match - day stadium transfers			1
@entity214 also offers a selection of cruises			0
