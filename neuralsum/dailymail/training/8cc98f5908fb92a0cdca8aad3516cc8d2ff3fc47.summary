by @entity0 published : 17:55 est , 25 march 2013 updated : 16:00 est , 26 march 2013 a new @entity3 's @entity2 slogan for its @entity5 line has sparked a backlash from parents who believe it is targeting teenagers rather than college age students			1
the @entity12 campaign was launched to tie in with @entity13 , however many understood it to be a brand new collection aimed at tweens and teens			1
parents took to the @entity19 facebook page to complain , accusing the lingerie giant of ' sexualizing our daughters ' and ' making it hard to raise wholesome children '			1
this afternoon , @entity19 responded to the complaints with a statement on its @entity41 page , insisting that it has no plans to launch a line for college - age women			1
' in response to questions we recently received , @entity5 is a brand for college - aged women , ' it read			0
' despite recent rumors , we have no plans to introduce a collection for younger women			0
' " @entity12 " was a slogan used in conjunction with the college spring break tradition			1
' the level of anger surrounding the rumored line was huge though , with hundreds of parents threatening to boycott the chain			0
one commenter wrote : ' you are selling out a generation of young women to make a buck with your " @entity12 " line			1
it is irresponsible and disgusting to market that level of sexually suggestive items to girls			0
as an adult , i will no longer be shopping in your store			0
' promotional opportunity : the @entity12 campaign was launched to tie in with @entity13 another wrote : ' you already do enough to undermine real woman 's and young ladies self esteem - now you want further sexualize our daughters [ sic ]			1
' and one women admitted to being a longtime fan of the brand , yet refuses to shop there any longer			0
' i have shopped regularly at @entity19 for a decade and will no longer be supporting your business , ' she wrote			1
' it 's a shame because i love your product , but i can not support a company that seeks to sexualize children			0
' ' i love your product , but i can not support a company that seeks to sexualize children ' a petition also seeks to stop the lingerie giant targeting teens			0
in a letter on @entity101 to @entity19 ceo @entity102 , it is accused of hiring ' younger looking teen models who are scantily clad and provocatively posed '			1
it also objects to the slogan ' @entity12 ' because it ' refers to young women as " things			1
" ' it read : ' by choosing to target teenagers with your new line , you are condoning teen sexuality and portraying teens as sexual objects			2
' while @entity19 says that it targets college age women and above only , it does not deny that it appeals to a younger market			2
chief financial officer @entity119 said at a conference recently : ' when somebody 's 15 or 16 years old , what do they want to be ? they want to be older , and they want to be cool like the girl in college , and that 's part of the magic of what we do at @entity19			1
' debate : the level of anger surrounding the rumored line was huge , with hundreds of parents threatening to boycott the chain on its @entity41 page and indeed some parents find the backlash ridiculous			0
mother @entity142 says that she chooses to buy her young girls @entity19 , and that @entity145 underwear is far more inappropriate , with slogans such as ' @entity147 ' and ' @entity148 '			2
' my kids , yes kids , wear your bras and underwear , ' she wrote on the @entity19 facebook page			2
' the fact that parents are letting their daughters shop at @entity19 is not any fault of the store ' ' yes , this is my choice to put my 14 and 12 year old in undergarments that fit them ! i buy the @entity19 age appropriate items			2
they have been in your undies for a few years now and i think it is ridiculous , that people are pitching a fix over your new line ! ' and an @entity174 - based employee of @entity19 also defended the brand , adding that @entity12 is ' simply the slogan for the spring break line ... it is not a line for middle schoolers			1
she added that it was up to parents to decide whether their daughters shop at @entity19 , and not the responsibility of the retailer			2
' the fact that parents are letting their daughters shop at @entity19 is not any fault of @entity19 , ' she wrote			2
' besides , not all of the items are risque ... it 's a matter of being a parent and making sure your daughter does n't buy the underwear that says ' feeling @entity192 ' on the butt when she 's 12 ... ' earlier this month , a conservative mommy blogger shocked fellow parents by admitting that she has no problem with her nine - year - old shopping at @entity19			1
sparking debate : mommy blogger @entity199 , from @entity200 , @entity201 , wrote that she has no problem with daughter @entity203 , nine , wearing @entity3 's @entity2 underwear @entity199 , from @entity200 , @entity201 , sparked fierce debate on parenting site @entity207 , when wrote that she did n't want daughter @entity203 ' to be the girl with the ugly underwear ' at camp or slumber parties			0
she later told @entity212 : ' i do n't think there 's anything wrong with having cute panties and bras from the big girl store			0
' but many other mothers took issue with her decision , arguing that the lingerie giant is ' too sexy ' , ' not intended for children ' , and that mrs @entity199 is at risk of oversexualizing the youngster at too young an age			0
one commenter on the @entity212 website wrote : ' it 's one thing to get your daughter cute , bright colored , fun underthings , but @entity19 is geared for sexy , not cute			1
' another wrote on the stir : ' are you people serious ? she is nine years old			0
i have four girls and as long as they are under my roof , i will not allow such clothing			0

the @entity12 campaign for @entity19 's pink line was launched to tie in with @entity13 , however many understood it to be a brand new collection aimed at tweens and teens
