by @entity0 in @entity1 never mind a place in the sun , if you ’ve ever dreamed of owning your very own @entity6 castle , or an island in the @entity10 lagoon , now ’s the time			1
as the cash - strapped @entity6 government attempts to tackle its deficit , the state is to sell off some of the family silver			2
a haunted fortress and a cardinal ’s trophy palace are among 50 historic properties for sale			1
the island of @entity23 is currently in ruins after being abandoned by the army but the @entity6 government hopes a developer will see its potential as a luxury resort , and is hoping to find buyers for another 49 properties the move recalls 2012 , when @entity33 was forced to sell off some its beautiful islands to foreign buyers , to chip away at its enormous debts			1
the @entity6 government hope that the nation 's treasures will be bought by private businesses and converted into hotels , restaurants and museums , bringing much needed employment and international investment			2
the sale of the 50 properties will raise £ 424.8million , minister for the @entity47 said			1
the sale was approved as part of an emergency decree aimed at keeping @entity6 ’s 2013 budget deficit within 3 % to avoid corrective action by @entity55			2
@entity56 , near @entity57 , was built for pope @entity58 and can be yours for £ 12.7million the medieval fortress sits above the feudal town of @entity62 the former prison is said to be haunted and currently serves as an art gallery prime minister @entity65 is planning to accompany the sales with further austerity measures worth £ 934million			1
another £ 1.27billion is to come from a second tranche of properties to be sold later on			1
the idea was first mooted last year by @entity71 , the technocrat who took over as prime minister in december 2011 , when @entity72 took public debt to unsustainable levels			2
the ‘ @entity76 ’ plan originally listed 350 properties but officials now deem that some assets , such as military airbases , are poorly suited for the commercial market			0
the properties are to be marketed through a state - run fund who will advance the money to the @entity87 , selling off the assets as buyers are found , the @entity6 newspaper @entity82 reported			0
the properties include @entity56 , which sits above its own feudal village near @entity57 , about 60miles from @entity1			0
the medieval fort was built for pope @entity92 in the 1270s and has a £ 12.7million price tag			1
said to be haunted , it was used as a prison from the mid- 19th century to 1989 and has since been an art gallery			1
in @entity10 the properties on offer include the @entity100 in @entity101 , north - east of @entity102			0
@entity103 features artistic frescoes and is set in parkland close to the highly - desirable @entity106 , near @entity107 the island was inhabited by monks and friars from the 11th century before it became a military base in the 1800s			1
since it was abandoned in 1961 , it has fallen into ruin but could appeal to international investors as a luxury resort			1
other national treasures to go under the hammer include the 18th century palace , @entity103			1
the frescoed villa , set in parkland near @entity106 , close to @entity107 , was built in the 18th century by @entity122 , the inquisitor of @entity124			1
property expert @entity126 head of @entity127 said the scheme made ‘ logical business sense			0
’ he said : ‘ the reality is that any government in @entity132 is looking to raise funds where they can			0
the cost of running these properties can be huge and the sheer upkeep of them can be unmanageable			0
‘ if properties can be bought by private investors , restored to their former glory it ’s good for everyone			0
it benefits local communities and puts some money in the state coffers			0
’ head of the @entity6 employers federation @entity148 , @entity149 , said to cut the deficit @entity6 ’s needed ‘ drastic action '			0
‘ continuing with the status quo our country will remain , at zero or low growth , ' he said			0
it is not the first time @entity6 has sold off assets			0
last year a succession of lighthouses on the island of @entity162 were sold off to private businesses and converted into hotels , galleries , and museums			2
the island ’s autonomous government could no longer afford the cost of maintaining and restoring them .			2
