in the 1980s , @entity0 was indisputably the aerobics queen			1
the @entity2 star released her first exercise video in 1982 and promptly sold 17 million copies - she has been widely credited for launching the fitness craze that spread across @entity6 and @entity7 in the @entity8			1
@entity0 , now 77 , is celebrating more than 30 years in the business by publishing her entire back catalogue of @entity12 cassettes as dvds and digital downloads			1
she is publishing her entire back catalogue of @entity12 cassettes digitally			1
to celebrate @entity17 looks at the change in workout videos from the 1950s @entity0 's wholesome videos are a far cry from the celebrity workouts of the @entity24 - where every half - popular soap actress , pop singer or reality star claims they 'll be the one to make you thin			1
the wardrobe has also taken a drastic turn , from leotards , legwarmers and perms to sleek gym gear , spray tans and false lashes but the changes are nothing compared to the very first aerobics programmes of the1950s			2
the @entity42 of the @entity43 was thought to be the very first exercise programme and featured @entity42 ' at home ' taking the viewers through a workout - the series ran from 1953 to 1985			1
it was followed by the @entity49 was the first woman to get her own exercise show in 1960 and continued in the role until 1978			2
the shift in the 1970s and 80s was towards skimpier clothing and group exercise in studio or beach settings			2
then in the 1990s , the likes of mr @entity61 on @entity62 made producers realise that there was money to be had from tying in celebrities and exercise			0
it resulted in the shedload of @entity69 's since 2000 that includes anyone from z - listers to @entity2 stars			0
but in the last few years , another phenomenon has developed - with tv stars keen to get as many sales as possible of their workout films , they are being convinced to pose in unflattering swimwear or exercise clothes in a public place			1
then around six months after the pictures are taken , the star miraculously drops the pounds and credits her new exercise video , which is available to buy in shops			0
@entity17 looks at some of the defining exercise videos of the last 65 years : 1950s - the @entity42 @entity42 presented fitness and exercise advice on television for 34 years , starting out as a 15 - minute segment between two news programmes in 1953			1
he had the longest running fitness show on @entity6 television , with it lasting 34 years			1
1950s - the @entity42 1960s - the @entity96 @entity49 was the first female to have her own exercise show when the first episode aired of the @entity96 in 1960			2
she went on to become a huge star , writing fitness books and recording albums including look good ! feel great ! and how to @entity102			2
1960s - the @entity96 1970s - @entity103 when @entity105 started the show @entity103 , she could never have anticiapted how popular exercising on a chair could be on television			0
the idea was to make an aerobics class that would suit the elderly and people with limited mobility			0
1970s - @entity103 1980s - @entity115 's bodies in motion @entity115 's bodies in @entity116 was one of the biggest exercise shows of the 1980s , alongside @entity0 's shows			1
it took the concept of group exercise and moved it to exotic locations like @entity124 ( pictured below			0
) @entity115 continued to produce fitness programmes until four years ago 1980s - @entity115 's bodies in motion 1990s - mr @entity61 fitness trainer mr @entity61 , real name @entity61 , first became a household name in 1993 after he was given a slot on @entity132 breakfast show @entity62			1
at the time , he was still calling himself by his real name , but after tv star @entity134 referred to him repeatedly as the motivator , he was inspired to take on the title as a stage name			0
he left the programme in 2000 after his daughter started having health problems and the family relocated to @entity142			0
but @entity61 regularly returns to the @entity7 for appearances as mr @entity61 and is a familiar sight on the festival circuit , where he often takes a midday slot on the main stage and helps bring hungover festival - goers back to life with a workout			1
1990s - mr @entity61 on @entity62 with @entity151 the @entity24 - celebrity workouts the @entity24 saw an explosion in everything celebrity - no tv show , clothing store or perfume house was compete without at least one z - list endorsement			0
the exercise video was one of the areas of entertainment most affected by this change - year on year , more and more stars are claiming they know the way to get fit			2
everyone from @entity168 contestants and @entity170 dancers to @entity171 and even football wags has released an exercise programme			0
the saturation of the market has led to producers having to invent new ways of making the public choose their dvd over the others on the supermarket shelf			0
one of the solutions appears to be an embarrassing staged photo of the celebrity in question working out in ill - fitting skimpy swimwear and exercise clothing , while at their heaviest			0
the celebrity then loses their weight in record time and unveils their new body , compared to their old one			0
clockwise from top left : the @entity198 workout with @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity201 , @entity168 's @entity202 , tv presenter @entity203 , @entity170 dancers @entity204 and @entity206 , @entity6 pop star @entity207 and @entity209 contestant @entity208 @entity168 's @entity210 and @entity211 were both pictured in unflattering outfits before their dvds were published			2
