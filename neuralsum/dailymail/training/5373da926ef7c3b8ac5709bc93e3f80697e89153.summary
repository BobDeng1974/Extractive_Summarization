by @entity0 @entity1 hosts a news series called @entity3 the most audacious daylight robbery since @entity5 will have us gasping at our tvs this week - and the criminals are n't human			1
a gang of rhesus macaques ransack an @entity12 home and make off with every last crumb			1
but there 's no need for a @entity17 appeal to catch these crooks , because the hidden cameras of @entity21 's new animal documentary series @entity3 have captured every stage of the heist			1
the gangsters have been hanging round a street market , trying to snatch fruit , but an open window in an apartment block tips them off to easier pickings			2
swinging along the power lines , the macaques post lookouts before peeping through the window			1
one swaggers in and pinches a mango from a fruit bowl			2
another seizes a naan bread			2
then the rest of the troop bowl in - and chaos ensues			2
tables are overturned , curtains torn and cupboards stripped bare			2
then a particularly clever monkey works out how to open the fridge , and discovers a dozen eggs			2
smashing them on the floor , the rascals start slurping them up - until one gangster overturns a tin bowl with a clatter			1
spooked , the burglars run ... all except one , who darts back to nick the last chapati			2
' it 's so human , ' laughs presenter @entity1 , the author and academic who has jetted all over the world filming monkeys and apes for the show			1
he had another encounter with macaques at a temple in @entity68 , where the monkeys are revered as divine beings			1
they make the most of their holy privileges , climbing all over visitors and stealing whatever they can			2
@entity1 managed to hang on to his spectacles , but he concedes that it was difficult to remember his script with monkeys hanging round his neck			1
' i got one little nip , ' he says , ' from a young one who got a bit over-excited			2
but that was n't the real problem			0
there were monkey droppings everywhere , and all over their feet - so after a day 's filming , i really stank			0
' the documentary captures a group of macaques breaking into a house and stealing from the fridge @entity1 is a tv veteran but @entity3 is , he says , the best thing he 's ever done - three hour - long shows that took him from @entity100 and @entity101 to the @entity102 and everywhere in between			1
filming the snow monkeys of @entity105 , his team took a thermal camera to discover how the macaques stay alive in sub-zero temperatures			1
that meant an uncomfortable day for @entity1 , as he stripped to his underwear in a blizzard			1
' it 's tv , ' he shrugs			0
' you have to show and tell - it 's not enough just to say it 's cold			0
' the heat - sensitive images reveal how fast a human loses heat : @entity1 's feet and head go a chilly blue within seconds			1
' if i 'd been on my own it would have been a crazy thing to do			0
my hands were so cold i could n't get dressed			0
' the monkeys cope by huddling on high branches at night and taking turns to squeeze to the warm centre of the pack - behaviour never caught on film before			1
the sequence that thrilled him most , though , was shot in @entity134 within moments of arriving in the forest			0
as the team unpacked their cameras , they realised chimpanzees were hunting overhead , pursuing a troupe of colobus monkeys			1
dr. @entity1 said he did meet some friendly primates whilst filming grabbing the cameras , @entity1 and the crew chased after them , before lurching to a halt - the chimps had caught one of their prey			1
' i squatted down on my haunches and did n't move as they ripped this animal apart			0
the alpha male plucked the heart out of this big colobus , held it up still beating and then ate it			0
we did n't capture that on film - but frankly , i do n't think we could have screened it on @entity21 anyway			1
' he was shocked at first			0
but when he reflected , @entity1 says he realised humans commit far worse acts of violence - ' and not because we 're hungry , either			1
i still think of all the animals i trust least it has to be humans			0
' most of the primates he filmed are rather cuter , though			0
his personal favourite was the aye - aye , a creature that has bat 's ears , a squirrel 's tail and hunts for grubs with a long , bony finger that 's much more sensitive than its other digits			0
for sheer adorability , though , an orangutan called @entity184 takes the biscuit ... and the bananas			0
she and her colony live on the edge of an @entity192 river , close to a village , and have picked up human quirks such as how to wash their fur with discarded shampoo			0
@entity197 likes to work up a good lather before dousing herself with river water			0
then she borrows a canoe to paddle across to the opposite bank			0
most remarkable of all , @entity197 has worked out how to open a door with a key			0
@entity1 and the crew waited days to film this behaviour , leaving a bunch of ripe bananas on display in a locked cabin			1
as the clock ticked down , @entity197 refused to perform and lazed under a tree instead			0
' i 'm certain she was winding us up , ' says @entity1 , half seriously			1
but when the team were about to pack up , @entity197 ambled over , took the key , turned the lock and took the fruit			0
she might have a career in crime ahead of her ... there 's certainly a pack of macaques who 'd appreciate her lock - cracking services			2
@entity3 , wednesday , 9pm , @entity21 .			1

a new series to start on @entity21 will document the life on monkeys
presenter @entity1 discovered they 're not always friendly
