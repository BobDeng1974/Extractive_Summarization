all to play for in @entity7 on thursday as @entity3 plays @entity8 and @entity9 takes on @entity10			1
lot of qualification scenarios involved and i 'm afraid it 's a bit of a mathematical maze ... @entity3 tells @entity16 : ' it 's nice			2
last year was tough but i 'm very happy to be back			0
the court atmosphere has been unbelievable			0
nice match to look forward to against @entity20 now			0
@entity3 started the game off by answering a net call with one of his own and it proved too good for @entity9			1
more unforced errors from the @entity25 made @entity3 's life easier before going to deuce			2
@entity9 pulled back two match points before @entity3 finally put him to the sword with another strong serve which @entity9 can only hit long			1
that 's more like it from @entity3 ! the @entity32 played the return of the match , sprinting across the baseline before whipping the ball across @entity9 and it seemed to rattle the @entity25 as the crowd sensed weakness			1
he will serve for the match ! @entity3 serves out well			1
it 's been a long time coming , but it looks like we 've got a game on here			0

@entity3 serves to stay in the second set ... @entity3 gets away with a soft serve as @entity9 hits the net with his forehand			1
the @entity25 has the upper - hand in the set			0

@entity9 wins the games with a lovely backhand volley			1
@entity1 : tremendous moment during last changeover as @entity78 plays @entity79 and the big screen cuts to an elderly gentleman in the crowd with his fingers in his ears			0
i 'm sure he would also not approve of the way both players dropped serve in consecutive games there ... @entity3 is absolutely furious with himself as he allows @entity9 back into this set			1
the @entity32 sent a backhand wide after brilliant work from @entity9 at the net			1
the @entity16 presenters are forced to apologise as the microphones pick up @entity3 shouting , ' every f * * * * * * time ' as the @entity32 miss - hits a return and is punished			1
@entity9 was 40 - 0 up but @entity3 battled back before the @entity25 looked to have hit a woman with his serve while at @entity100			1
@entity9 hit the following serve well wide and could n't regain his composure as yet another unforced error gives @entity3 the game			1
@entity3 continues to hold without any real threat to his serve			2
@entity1 : @entity8 will no doubt be following this one with interest			2
anything other than a @entity3 straight sets victory and the @entity109 qualifies for the semis tonight			2
if @entity3 does go on to win this in straights , then it 's all still to play for in @entity7 on thursday			2
@entity54 : the usual smattering of footballers not present this evening but 17,500 crowd getting right behind @entity3			2
a solid performance from him in the first set and he ’s profited from the wayward forehand of @entity9 , whose first serve has missed too often to cause what would only be a mini upset			2
as against @entity8 , you ’d expect @entity9 to improve in this set			1
@entity9 holds his serve well to take the first game of the second set			2
he did n't start the game well but ended with a nice volley and a serve that proved too hot to handle for @entity3			2
@entity9 made the final game of the set a difficult one , but @entity3 got the points on the board early enough to see it out			1
the @entity32 looks a different player from the one that lost to @entity10 on sunday			1
@entity9 wo n't go down in a fight , particularly when he 's got that huge serve			2
the @entity25 hits some big serves and actually started to make @entity3 run around a little bit			2
@entity3 hits a return long to have @entity9 the game			1
@entity143 will serve for the set			0
@entity1 : ' just a sick slice , ' says the @entity25 behind me as @entity3 plays one of his trademark shots with plenty of spin down the line			2
moments later , @entity3 has the first break of the match			1
@entity9 looking cagey on his forehand side			0
that will go down as @entity3 's easiest game of the night so far			0

@entity3 earns himself the break and pumps his fist towards the crowd			0
@entity9 has played several wide shots tonight			0
his latest coming in the sixth game from what should have been an easy smash			0
he 's also only getting 33 per cent of his first serves in			0
@entity3 on the other hand is looking more and more up for it			0
' come on , fire up ' he shouts			0
@entity54 : @entity3 could n't have asked for more than two second serves on those break points , you do n't get many opportunities against the giant @entity173			0
crowd noticeably more partisan tonight			0
@entity3 continues to hold his serve and looks to be getting in the groove now			0
the @entity32 player an excellent forehand to beat @entity9 before a delightful backhand slice saw the @entity25 scrambling for the ball			1
@entity9 does well to keep his cool and win four points in a row to stop @entity3 from an early break in the first			1
the big @entity25 made two unforced errors before battling back and using that big serve to his advantage			0
@entity3 makes hard work of the third set but the @entity189 no 1 wins it quite brilliantly with a drop shot which @entity9 can only hit out of the court			1
both players are taking a while to get going , particularly @entity9 , who seems a tad nervous			0
@entity9 answer with his own hold and hit couple of pretty un-returnable serves as you 'd expect from the big - hitter			1
@entity3 looked a little sluggish during that one			0
1 - 1 ! @entity3 wins the first game with relative ease			1
the @entity32 showed some brilliant handling and kept @entity9 on the move which will be crucial this evening			1
he finished the game off with an ace			0
@entity205 is in the audience with @entity207 partner @entity208			0
let 's hope @entity3 's performance is n't as stiff as his mother 's ... @entity1 : the pre-show in the arena is always impressive			0
a stirring video message from @entity215 , a dazzling lights show and then the players walk out onto court in a boxing - style entrance			0
in fact , even the umpire has his moment as he is introduced to the crowd as he walks out ! @entity3 wins the coin toss and elects to serves first			2
it 's a positive step as he looks to get in the lead early on			0
the pair are currently going through the rally warm - ups			0
@entity3 tells @entity16 : ' hopefully i 'll hit the ball better than i did the other day			0
i 'll need to play , hopefully get a lot of returns back			0
if i can make it tough for @entity9 on his service games , that 's half the battle			0
' @entity54 : after his dreadful performance on sunday against @entity10 i see two reasons for optimism around @entity3 tonight : firstly he tends to play better when his back is against the wall and he wants to prove people wrong , which is the case tonight			1
also , @entity8 said after his match that he thinks this court is difficult to blast your way out of trouble on with the serve , due to its sluggish speed , so perhaps that main weapon for @entity9 might not be as potent as usual			1
another full house for the evening so there ought to be no lack of atmosphere as @entity3 tries to survive			0
@entity1 : not the best quality doubles match but entertaining nonetheless as @entity256 and @entity257 beat @entity258 and @entity259 in two tiebreaks			0
@entity262 gasps in the press centre at some of those missed volleys ... we now await the arrival of @entity3 and @entity9			1
the @entity269 crowd are being made to wait for the start of @entity3 's match , but they do n't mind be the sounds of it as the @entity256 / @entity257 vs @entity258 / @entity259 doubles match is currently throwing up a fantastic tie - break decider			1
@entity1 : after a hectic run of 23 matches in 37 days to qualify for the @entity279 , @entity3 faces the possibility that this tournament may effectively be over for him on day three			2
after @entity8 's victory over @entity10 this afternoon , @entity3 has to beat @entity9 tonight if he is to go into thursday 's match against @entity8 still with a chance to go through to the semi-finals			1
it 's squeaky bum time , as one of @entity3 's fellow @entity289 once famously said ... @entity8 picked up his second win of the week earlier this morning with a straight sets victory against @entity3 's conqueror @entity10			1
@entity8 made the most of @entity10 's erratic play to secure a 6 - 3 , 6 - 2 victory and move closer to a semi-final spot while increasing the pressure on @entity3			1
