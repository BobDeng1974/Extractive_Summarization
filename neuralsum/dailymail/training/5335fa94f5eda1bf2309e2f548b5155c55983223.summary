@entity0 believes @entity1 could benefit from having a core of players from a handful of top clubs , as seen with @entity6 and @entity7 in recent years			1
both countries boasted a strong axis formed around individuals from two of their best clubs when they won the 2010 and 2014 @entity13 , respectively			2
a similar situation now appears to be building in the @entity1 set - up , with nine of the current 21 - strong squad playing for either for @entity17 or @entity18			1
@entity0 , one of five @entity18 players in the @entity1 squad , in action against @entity22 @entity23 is pleased to see a group of @entity18 players forcing their way into his plans for @entity28 @entity29 celebrates scoring against @entity22 at @entity30 on thursday night there are four players from @entity33 in the side right now , whereas the @entity36 ' quintet all began the second half of thursday 's 5 - 0 defeat of @entity22 together after @entity0 came off the bench			1
the midfielder 's introduction helped up the tempo and underlined the strong bond with his club team - mates , like when he provided the assist for @entity29 just minutes after the break			1
' when you do get to play week in , week out with team - mates and then bring that to international football , just knowing each other , off the pitch and on it , does really help in gelling the team together , ' @entity0 said			1
' the @entity54 and the @entity55 they 've been able to do that			0
@entity6 have a big influence from @entity59 and @entity60 and when you go and watch @entity6 play it 's almost like watching @entity60 or @entity59 play at times , with the number of players on the pitch			0
' it is a nice thing to have that with @entity18 at the moment			2
@entity17 have got a good number of players as well			0
' it 's not just those two clubs , everyone who comes away really does gel in well with the team and helps us to hopefully be successful and do well			0
' @entity7 started with six @entity76 players as they won the @entity78 final against @entity79 @entity6 's starting @entity80 in the @entity82 final was made up of nine players from @entity59 and @entity60 @entity0 says there is a ' really nice feel ' to the squad right now , despite the hangover from @entity1 's dismal @entity78 having yet to fully subside			1
the @entity18 midfielder could only watch on helplessly in @entity89 after missing the tournament through knee ligament damage sustained in the warm - up clash with @entity93			1
' i guess all i can do is try and make up for lost time , ' @entity0 said			2
' i did get a lot of experience out of that			0
it was a disappointing experience for me personally on the injury front and obviously on the bigger scale , as well for the nation			0
' i know what we 're playing for again in this qualifying campaign and it does give you the bit between the teeth to try and really push on and keep yourself fit , keep yourself in and about , playing as much as football as possible			2
' it 's really nice to be in good form - touch wood , i do n't want to jinx myself with injuries			0
' it 's nice to feel good at the moment			0
i feel fresh and it 's important to keep myself that way so i can help the team progress			0
' @entity0 will be hoping his display against @entity22 could see him start sunday 's qualifier in @entity121 , a match few are expecting @entity23 's men to fall short in			1
that only fuels former @entity1 under - 21s manager @entity125 's belief that eligible players like @entity0 , @entity128 and @entity129 should be playing for the @entity130 , if @entity131 wants them			1
@entity132 was ' loaned ' to the @entity133 for this week 's two - legged @entity135 play - off with @entity136 @entity138 midfielder @entity137 ( centre ) , pictured in training with @entity1 's under 21 squad , was given the chance to train with the senior squad by @entity23 @entity144 and @entity145 were , in @entity23 's words , ' loaned ' to the @entity133 for this week 's two - legged @entity147 play - off with @entity136 , only for injury to see the latter bumped back up to the senior squad			1
' why did i come over here ? ' @entity0 said with a laugh when asked about the hot potato subject			2
' that 's a tricky question to answer , obviously			0
it 's for the @entity1 manager to put his views on that			2
' if he 's got boys in the @entity1 squad and wants them in and around the @entity1 squad that 's his choice			1
' if he wants to advise them to go and play for the under 21s then again that 's his choice			0
that 's all i can say on that matter			0

@entity29 , @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity129 all started in the 5 - 0 win against @entity22
@entity0 came off the bench and *impressed*
@entity18 have more players in the @entity1 squad than any other club
@entity23 believes his young @entity36 are starting to reach their potential and have plenty more to give
@entity0 is *confident* that playing together at club level will *improve* their *performances* for the national side
@entity7 won the @entity187 with six @entity76 players in their starting xi against @entity79 in the final
