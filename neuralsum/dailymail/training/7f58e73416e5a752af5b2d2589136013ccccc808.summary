by @entity0 published : 03:42 est , 23 march 2012 updated : 13:13 est , 23 march 2012 a businesswoman was sacked after a night entertaining clients ended in spectacular embarrassment after she mocked a woman for drinking diluted alcohol			1
high - powered financial adviser , @entity7 , faces claims she reduced a woman client to tears after demanding why she was only drinking spritzers , calling her partner a ' c * * * ' and dragging him outside for a cigarette even though he did n't smoke			2
exactly what happened at the @entity16 pub , in @entity17 , south @entity18 , is hotly disputed by @entity19 who - while agreeing she was ' a bit hazy ' after having ' quite a bit ' to drink - swiftly apologised and denies anything she did justified her summary dismissal from her job			1
@entity7 ( left ) and friend at the races			2
@entity19 admitted she had drunk ' quite a bit ' on the night she was meant to be entertaining clients in @entity17 , south @entity18 @entity19 , founder and former md of @entity17 - based @entity34 , was given her marching orders in 2010 and had her unfair dismissal claim against the company rejected by an employment tribunal in october that year			1
however , the @entity39 has now ordered a re-hearing of her case , ruling that the ' clear dispute ' over what happened at the @entity16 on the friday night of january 22 , 2010 , must be further investigated and resolved			2
judge @entity44 said @entity34 's chairman , @entity45 , received a call from ms @entity7 at about 8pm that evening , saying she had ' fu * * ed up again ' and offended a client			2
@entity19 sent an apologetic email to the client early the next morning saying ' i hope you can forgive me '			2
and the woman , although castigating her for her ' inappropriate and unprofessional ' behaviour , was understanding and emailed back , ' let 's just move on '			0
however , the ' very upset and vociferous ' client and her partner later spent an hour and a half complaining to ms @entity45 , who was ' very embarrassed and angry '			0
the client told ms @entity45 it was ' apparent she had already been drinking ' when @entity19 arrived at the bar for a meeting to discuss financial advice			0
the woman said @entity19 became ' more inebriated ' as the evening wore on and at one point ' dragged ' her partner outside to have a cigarette , even though he was a non-smoker			0
drinking : the pub where @entity19 met her clients and the alleged bad behaviour that led to her dismissal took place the client also reported that @entity19 had called her partner ' a c * * t ' which , although it was said jokingly , he found shocking and offensive			1
judge @entity44 added : ' when the client did not want to carry on drinking at the same pace as her , @entity19 berated her for not wanting to carry on drinking and demanded to know why she was drinking spritzers			0
' the client became so upset that she began to cry			0
' @entity19 accepted she had offended the client and ' it was probably not sensible to drink in client meetings '			0
she said the details of what happened were ' inevitably a bit hazy '			0
she argued the client , with whom she said she had been drinking for four hours , had ' become over-sensitive through drink ' and the incident was ' not unduly serious ' as the woman had accepted her apology			0
accusation : miss @entity98 allegedly had words with her client about the consumption of wine spritzers however , ms @entity45 ' viewed the matter extremely seriously ' and judge @entity44 said disciplinary action was launched , culminating in @entity19 ' dismissal on grounds of alleged ' gross misconduct '			1
a south @entity18 employment tribunal concluded in october 2010 that it had ' no hesitation in concluding that @entity19 ' conduct justified summary dismissal without notice '			1
overturning that ruling , judge @entity44 said : ' in this case there was a clear dispute on the evidence as to what had taken place in the @entity16 bar on the evening of january 22 , 2010			0
' the @entity122 made no attempt to reconcile these differing versions , ' said the judge , who added the tribunal had failed to explain why it considered @entity19 ' dismissal justified and ' within the range of reasonable responses '			1
' essentially , the tribunal made an error of law in saying that there was no conflict of fact between what @entity19 said had occurred on the night of january 22 , 2010 , and the view taken by @entity34			1
' these were serious differences of fact that the tribunal did not attempt to properly resolve ' , ruled the judge			1
allowing @entity143 ' appeal , judge @entity44 sent her unfair dismissal claim back to a fresh employment tribunal for a re-hearing , a date for which has yet to be set .			1

@entity98 disputed dismissal at *industrial* tribunal
