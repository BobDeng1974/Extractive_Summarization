but what began as a probe into who said what and when has grown amid claims that the senior politician was ‘ stitched up ’			1
mr @entity14 and a close circle of supporters believe he was the victim of a deliberate and co-ordinated attempt to smear the @entity15 party and ruin his career			2
this week marks a year since @entity14 allegedly called police guarding the gates of @entity24 ' plebs ' in december , @entity82 footage cast doubt on the police version of events and a supposedly independent witness was apparently exposed as a fraud			1
