@entity1 chairman @entity0 today publicly criticised an extraordinary attempt to gag a cabinet minister appearing on one of its highest profile current affairs programmes as the @entity8 scandal deepened			1
an email leaked to the @entity10 reveals @entity12 chairman @entity11 was warned against raising damaging allegations against the corporation hours before an appearance on @entity16 just days ago			1
@entity0 said the email was ' misleading ' and expressed in ' unfortunate ' language			0
he said he could understand why mr @entity19 and made a complaint			0
@entity12 chairman @entity11 was warned against raising damaging allegations against the corporation hours before an appearance on @entity16 amid increasing acrimony between the government and the @entity1 over its handling of the @entity28 affair , mr @entity11 yesterday made a formal complaint to @entity0			1
he said the corporation had been ‘ trying to provide guidance for an elected representative appearing on a @entity1 opinion show - guidance which in the event has turned out to be wholly inaccurate ’			1
the complaint from mr @entity11 suggesting the @entity1 was trying to quash criticism on its own outlets will heighten tensions between the corporation and the government			2
a @entity1 message , sent to the @entity12 chairman on october 11 as the corporation was fighting to contain the @entity42 revelations , insisted claims @entity44 had scrapped an investigation into the affair because of internal pressure were ‘ malicious ’			1
mr @entity11 was told by the @entity1 ’s head of public affairs @entity49 : ‘ no pressure was applied to drop this investigation			1
to suggest otherwise is to risk impugning the professional reputation and integrity of a number of journalists			0
’ she went on to insist that to suggest the @entity44 expose of @entity28 was dropped for any reason other than the claims against the presenter could not be substantiated was ‘ false and very damaging to the @entity1 and individuals ’			1
any allegation that any evidence had been withheld from police was ‘ also damaging and false ’ , the minister was warned			0
the email was sent to @entity12 chairman @entity11 by @entity49 , head of public affairs at the @entity1 the email referred mr @entity11 to a blog written by @entity44 editor @entity72 explaining the decision not to broadcast claims against @entity42			1
the @entity1 has since admitted that key elements of mr @entity72 ’s defence were inaccurate			2
for instance , the claim that no evidence was withheld from police has been shown to be false , since some of @entity8 ’s victims who were interviewed for the aborted @entity44 investigation had not in fact spoken to detectives			2
today @entity0 said : ' i ’ve said in reply to him that if i ’d been in his position would have felt much the same and would have written the same sort of letter			2
' i think there are two points he made in that letter			0
the first was it ’s wrong for the @entity1 to give a briefing about its corporate position			0
i ’m not sure i ’d agree with that			0
' but the fact that it was misleading - that ’s what was wrong			0
i also think the terms in which it was expressed were unfortunate			0
' @entity44 editor @entity72 explained the decision not to broadcast claims against @entity42 in a blog post mr @entity11 told the @entity10 he had attempted to pass the email to an inquiry being headed by former @entity110 chief @entity109 , who has been asked by the @entity1 to investigate whether inappropriate managerial pressure was applied to prevent disclosure of the allegations against @entity8			1
incredibly , however , he said had been told the inquiry was not considering any evidence from external sources – prompting him to complain to @entity0			2
‘ i received the email on the evening that i appeared on @entity16			0
it was sent just a couple of hours before the show was recorded , and as a result i did not see it before i went on , ’ mr @entity11 wrote to the @entity1 chairman			1
‘ however , in light of … subsequent admissions made by the @entity1 concerning @entity8 and @entity44 , i think it is important to raise the contents of the email with you			1
‘ i believe that in light of these admissions , the content of ms @entity49 's email was misleading ; deliberately or otherwise			0
' @entity129 said the @entity1 had ' serious questions ' to answer about how @entity8 ( pictured ) was able to get away with the abuse for so long mr @entity11 ' letter added : ' i ’m concerned that this amounted to the @entity1 trying to provide guidance for an elected representative appearing on a @entity1 opinion show - guidance which in the event has turned out to be wholly inaccurate			1
‘ i had wished to submit this information for the consideration of the @entity141 , but am further concerned that the investigation is not taking external representations			0
i hope that you are therefore able to alert the appropriate @entity1 review to my concerns			0
’ mr @entity11 told the @entity10 : ‘ given what we now know about this situation , this email raises further serious concerns about the @entity1 ’s handling of this affair , even after the facts started to become apparent			1
’ senior @entity155 are furious that @entity0 has suggested culture secretary @entity156 was threatening the independence of the @entity1 by expressing concern about the way the @entity1 has responded to revelations of @entity42 ’s paedophile activities			2
mp sir @entity162 , a former @entity1 journalist , accused the ‘ out of touch ’ @entity1 chairman of ‘ arrogance ’ – and became the first politician to suggest that the scandal may force the resignation of both @entity0 and @entity1 director - general @entity169			1
at prime minister ’s questions , @entity129 said the @entity1 had ‘ serious questions ’ to answer about how @entity8 was able to get away with the abuse for so long , adding that he did not rule out ‘ further steps ’ in addition to the inquiries already under way			1
@entity177 , a @entity12 member of the culture , media and sport select committee , said the email to mr @entity11 suggested the @entity1 had been more concerned with protecting its own reputation than establishing the truth			1
‘ i ’m sure that what @entity49 sent was what she genuinely believed to be the case , and that was the message from the senior echelons of the @entity1 , ’ he said			0
‘ but actually if the @entity1 had spent more time getting to the bottom of the situation and less than worrying about news management , they would n’t find themselves in such a mess at the moment			0
‘ their priority in all of this was reputation management			0
that ’s what i ’m afraid was pretty clear from our session today – that even the director - general has made a pretty lamentable effort to find out what has gone on			0
’ the @entity1 has since admitted that key elements of mr @entity72 's defence were inaccurate a @entity1 spokesman insisted the message had also been sent to the other @entity210 on the @entity16 panel , @entity213 ’s @entity212 and deputy @entity214 leader @entity214			2
‘ the @entity1 ’s head of public affairs was simply doing her job of keeping mps of all parties across @entity1 issues that could come up on the programme			1
as we have clarified , the @entity1 regrets that the explanation given by the @entity44 editor in his blog was inaccurate or incomplete in some respects , ’ the spokesman added			1
in a letter to @entity0 , mrs @entity156 said mr @entity169 's evidence to @entity229 and the @entity1 's handling of the wider scandal raised ‘ very real concerns ’ about public trust			1
the @entity1 chairman ’s reply contained a thinly veiled warning that the government should not wade into the row			2
‘ i know that you will not want to give any impression that you are questioning the independence of the @entity1 , ’ he wrote			0
but conservative mp sir @entity162 , a former producer and director of current affairs programmes at the @entity1 , said @entity0 had made clear that he was ‘ out of touch , not only with the strength of feeling and concern in @entity229 about the @entity28 affair and related matters but , more importantly , with the strength of public revulsion at what has happened at @entity254 and with the corporate culture that , for the best part of 40 years , has apparently covered it up ’			1
‘ attack may be the best form of defence but in seeking to criticise a culture secretary who has not ever sought to challenge the independence of the @entity1 , he indicates how very little , within that corporate arrogance , has really changed , ’ he added			0
‘ the ' @entity1 knows best ' line simply does not wash any more			0
‘ @entity1 management , over far too many years , has sought to maintain an imperious disdain for criticism and it has become clear that successive directors general have , while happy to criticise others for not answering difficult questions , either turned a blind eye to criminal activities or have not known what has been going on on their own doorstep , which is also culpable			2
‘ it is as if your favourite and respectable aunt has been revealed to be on the game , and if @entity0 is not able to grasp that , then i fear that not only the director general but also the chairman of the @entity282 are going to have to fall on their swords			2

@entity12 party chairman @entity11 was told by producers he could not mention allegations about why @entity44 dropped its @entity8 report
the guidance sent by the @entity1 's head of public affairs later turned out to be ' wholly inaccurate '
minister has written to @entity1 chairman @entity0 to complain
