a small fragment of ancient pottery found in modern @entity2 has shed light on its @entity5 inhabitants and could prove that the reigns of @entity7 and @entity8 actually occurred			1
the 10th century @entity9 ' @entity10 ' was unearthed last year , and scientists were initially baffled by the bizarre language that was inscribed on the remains of a jug			0
but leading expert dr @entity16 believe the language is a primitive form of @entity19 which suggests the ancient israelites were accurately recording history much earlier than previously thought			1
the @entity32 were a @entity5 people who lived in what is now modern @entity2			0
but ancient near eastern history and biblical studies expert dr @entity16 has said that this is incorrect and that the mysterious language is in fact the original and oldest form of @entity19 – placing the ancient israelites in @entity43 far earlier that previously thought			1
the inscription was found in @entity45 , near near @entity46 in @entity43 ( pictured ) in december last year the inscription was found among a pile of pottery ( pictured )			0
leading expert @entity16 believes the language is a primitive form of @entity19 which suggests the ancient israelites were recording history much earlier than previously thought ‘ hebrew speakers were controlling @entity43 in the 10th century [ @entity9 ] , which biblical chronology points to as the time of @entity8 and @entity7 , ' he told @entity56			1
‘ whoever they were , they were writing in @entity19 like they owned the place , ’ he added			0
if the dr @entity16 ’s claim is correct , it could provide evidence of the accuracy of the @entity66 , and that the ancient israelites were writing their history as things happened as opposed to writing it down hundreds of years later			0
if expert @entity16 is correct , it could mean the @entity5 stories of @entity8 and @entity7 were not just passed down orally and recorded hundreds of years later but written down at the time and are true this would make the @entity66 an historical account of real - life events			1
as expected , dr @entity16 ’s claims are stirring up controversy among the archaeological community			0
@entity82 archaeologist @entity81 told @entity56 that the @entity10 is critical to the early history of @entity2 but that romantic notions of the @entity5 should n't cloud scientific methods			2
in 2008 , when a similar inscription was found at a site many now believe is one of @entity8 's palaces , he warned against the ' revival in the belief that what 's written in the @entity5 is accurate like a newspaper			2

archaeologists discovered small piece of pottery with writing on it last year
found in modern *day* @entity2 , the 3000 - year - old @entity10 was originally though to have @entity5 @entity31 language on it
now expert believes mysterious language is @entity19 , which could prove that ancient israelites recorded history much earlier that originally thought
could mean @entity5 stories of @entity8 and @entity7 were not passed down orally but written down at the time and are accurate
