@entity0 , director of @entity1 , told @entity3 that people retreated to a ' comfort zone ' of thinking grooming and abuse only happen ' elsewhere ' children are being sexually abused in every town in the country , police and experts warned today			1
@entity0 , director of @entity1 ( @entity2 ) , told @entity3 that people retreated to a ' comfort zone ' of thinking grooming and abuse only happen ' elsewhere '			1
and detective superintendent @entity16 said @entity17 was taking place in ' all communities ' across the country			2
in the last year police have been inundated with reports of child sexual exploitation , including historic cases and allegations of grooming and trafficking across the country			1
it follows high profile historical cases involving celebrities such as @entity31 and revelations about sex gangs in @entity34 and @entity35			1
but ms @entity0 insisted it was wrong to think the crimes were only restricted to parts of the country or certain ' types ' of children			2
' it 's a global crime so the concept of it only happening in a section of the country is wrong , it 's across the whole country , ' she told @entity3			0
' this type of abuse is in every town			1
' she said one of the problems was that parents and other adults prefer to think that child sex abuse is not the sort of thing that happens where they live			1
' we are all in a much better comfort zone if we think this type of abuse happens elsewhere and its other people who are affected and it 's other people doing the crime , that there is another ring going on			1
' and it 's something that we need to try and change			0
' she insisted the warning was not about ' scaremongering ' , adding : ' what we are trying to do is make it calmer and to say that this type of child abuse is occurring across the country			1
' she said she knew of serious cases involving families in @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , the @entity85 and @entity86			1
she warned that it was wrong to think only children in major cities were at risk			0
' if you look at @entity93 , it only takes 30minutes to get into @entity95 or @entity96 or @entity97			0
' almost anywhere in the country , you are within 30 or 40 minutes of a large town or city and children are trafficked			0
' if we have a preconceived idea as to the sort of child that is at risk , what you are missing out on is the fact that there are other victims as well			0
' they are teenagers , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 year - olds			0
these are young adults and they are different to a younger child			0
' we are not talking about abuse in the home , it is outside , it can often start in schools			2
it is a very complex crime			0
' there has been a rise in reported cases of abuse following revelations about sex gangs in @entity34 and @entity35 ( pictured ) but ms @entity0 insisted it was wrong to think the crimes were only restricted to parts of the country or certain ' types ' of children @entity2 said it had noticed an increase in people using so - called ' legal highs ' to groom youngsters for sex and the crime was widespread across @entity140			1
a major problem for police and social services is that where teenagers have been groomed they are not even aware that they are being abused and often believe they are in a loving relationship			1
this can make it difficult to persuade them to give evidence against their abusers			0
the police in the past have also been accused of failing to take the issue seriously and not believing some of the victims who have come forward			2
the @entity159 has estimated that there are some 16,000 children at risk of child sexual exploitation			0
@entity164 , a spokesman for the national child protection working group , said the police had made progress in improving the response to all forms of child abuse			1
he told @entity171 's today programme : ' child sexual abuse has been hidden in our society for too long and , certainly in recent months , that picture has changed			2
' the police is certainly now committed to doing all we can to root out child sexual exploitation and prevent more people from becoming victims			2
' it is an abhorrent crime , there is absolutely no doubt about that			0
we are learning lessons , we have learned significant lessons from the past , but we are absolutely committed to improving the police response to these sorts of awful acts			2
' he added : ' the last 12 months have been shocking , in terms of the scale			0
what we know is the @entity159 have estimated that there are some 16,000 children at risk of @entity17 across the country			0
' that cse takes place in all communities			0
there has been a model which has been frequently reported in the media over the last 12 months linked to cases such as @entity34 and @entity35 , but let 's be clear : it takes place in all communities , urban , rural , small and large			1
' i do n't think there will be a community that could not potentially be affected by @entity17			0
' we are facing unprecedented demand within policing			1
we know that , across most forces , reports of abuse are going up by 17 per cent year on year			1
' that abuse is made up of a number of things			2
most recently we have seen increases in reports of historic sexual abuse in institutions and also by well - known personalities and by groups and gangs			1
' there is nothing that causes me to believe that situation is going to change and we are not going to see a continuation of the level of reporting			0

@entity238 insists problem is *nationwide*
warns that it is *misguided* to think abuse cases are confined to some areas
follows revelations about sex gangs in @entity34 and @entity35
police facing ' unprecedented demand ' with reports of abuse up 17 *%*
