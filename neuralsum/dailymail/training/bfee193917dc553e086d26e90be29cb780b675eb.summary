i get around : neanderthals interbred with all modern humans except those from @entity5 , a new study suggests @entity7 are the only modern humans whose ancestors apparently did not interbreed with @entity2 , new research suggests			1
scientists studying human genetic ancestry have found that , like modern @entity14 peoples , modern @entity12 also carry genetic traces which suggest some @entity2 ancestry			1
neanderthals were a closely related species of humans who thrived in @entity20 and the @entity21 during the last @entity22 but died out around 30,000 years ago			0
genetic evidence published in 2010 suggests they interbred with the ancestors of some modern humans , with as much as 1 to 4 per cent of modern @entity14 genomes containing @entity2 dna			1
according to one theory , this occurred between 80,000 and 50,000 years ago , shortly after the proto - @entity31 emerged from @entity5 , while they were still one population			0
an alternative explanation suggests that was an ancestral group which gave rise to both @entity2 and modern non-africans which genetically split from other @entity38 about 230,000 years ago and stayed separate until finally leaving @entity5			2
to determine which scenario is more likely scientists analysed @entity12 , since some researchers have suggested were the source of the out - of - africa migrations that led to humans spreading across the world			0
the team led by @entity47 , a palaeontologist at @entity49 's @entity48 , analysed a total of 780,000 genetic variants in 125 people from seven @entity12 locations			0
they found that @entity12 populations have a significant excess of genetic variants shared with the neanderthal genome compared to @entity59 - on a par to that found in @entity63 humans			0
as expected , findings showed that those @entity12 populations whose ancestors had the most interbreeding with modern @entity21 of @entity20 humans also had a high amount of @entity2 ancestry , and those whose ancestors bred with @entity59 had a lower @entity2 signal			1
however , they also found certain @entity12 populations with very little @entity14 ancestry - @entity73 berbers and @entity75 - that also showed a strong @entity2 signal , in some cases as high or higher than @entity14 populations			1
@entity2 genetic introgression in @entity12 populations as a fraction of that found in @entity20 : relative proportion of @entity85 ancestry for each population is presented as the dark blue section of the pies on a map of @entity12			1
each population is also represented as a barplot of the different geographic genetic components ; in red : @entity12 , in blue : @entity5 , in green : @entity20 , in yellow : @entity21 the researchers wrote in the open - access journal @entity98 : ' eurasian populations are the closest to @entity2 among modern humans , which is in agreement with previous studies			1
' @entity38 are , as expected , more distant to @entity85 , whereas @entity12 individuals are placed between these two groups			0
[ ... ] ' it is interesting to notice that the @entity12 populations closer to @entity2 are populations with a large known @entity20 or @entity21 admixture , but also the @entity73 that have an almost complete autochthonous @entity12 genetic component			1
' the only genetically ' pure ' humans : @entity38 are the only human population that do not show any traces of interbreeding with @entity2 the results suggested that the signal came directly from ancient mixing with @entity2 and not with more recent interbreeding with modern humans who carried some @entity2 genes			1
neanderthals learned how to make jewellery and sophisticated tools from the ancestors of modern humans , a study suggests			0
new high precision radiocarbon dating shows that a cultural exchange may have taken place between modern humans and @entity2 in @entity129 and @entity130 more than 40,000 years ago			1
the findings have important implications for our understanding of our long - extinct sister species			0
if @entity2 made such ornaments , they must have been capable of symbolic behaviour thought to be unique to man			0
however , the researchers do not believe that this mixing came from @entity2 who entered @entity12 and made contact with the population there			2
' given that the @entity12 autochthonous ancestry seems to be 12,000 – 40,000 years old , our hypothesis is that this ancestral population was descendant from the populations that first interbreed with @entity2 about ~ 37,000 – 86,000 years ago somewhere in the @entity152 , ' they wrote			2
they admit that with their current data they have not managed to completely dispense with the possibility that these @entity2 traces may have come from some common ancestor to both humans and our extinct cousins			2
however , they say their findings as well as those of previous studies ' tend to favor the admixture hypothesis as the most plausible one			0
' ' in any case , ' they conclude , ' our results show that @entity85 genomic traces do not mark a division between @entity12 and non-africans but rather a division between @entity175 and the rest of modern human groups , including those from @entity12			2

modern @entity20 and @entity180 share as much as 1 to 4 per cent of their dna with @entity2
study now shows that @entity12 also have a similar proportion of their dna from the extinct human relatives
