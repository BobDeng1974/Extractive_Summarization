by @entity0 published : 18:07 est , 3 july 2012 updated : 18:07 est , 3 july 2012 it keeps getting uglier on the national arena			0
last week saw a @entity4 legislator from @entity5 being thrashed by a mob in @entity8 town			1
the fury of the men almost made you believe the woman was a murderess or a rash driver who had run over pedestrians in a drunken state			2
but the woman 's crime was a rather tame one			0
in fact , going by what men have done for ages , it was no crime at all : @entity26 had married a man she met on @entity28 without divorcing her husband			1
a video grab of @entity4 mla @entity26 and her second husband @entity32 who were beaten up and injured by a mob at @entity34 in @entity5 a police case by her husband was all it took for the upholders of the patriarchal order to take the law in their own vile hands and unleash themselves in a cowardly manner on a woman			1
the fact that she was also pregnant surely could n't have mattered a wee bit to these lumpens			0
perhaps we should n't be taking this incident so seriously			0
after all , men do such things on a regular basis within the confines of their homes			2
why , they sometimes deal out worse treatment to women from the underprivileged class , parading them naked on the streets or raping them in public view			2
@entity26 thinks her political rivals are behind this dastardly incident			1
while this may be true , it does n't explain the righteousness with which the mob went about the ' job '			0
this can be accounted for only by the chauvinistic mindset of the @entity71 male			2
he who condones a man marrying a second time but whose hackles get raised when a woman does such a thing			0
@entity26 forgot when she took the step that she was threatening the entire patriarchal order			1
for , if more women chose the path she has taken , where would the poor @entity71 males be ? how would they manage to get away with their insensitivity and shortcomings ? clearly , all this talk of change is bunkum			1
as far as the male attitude is concerned little has altered since those centuries when women were dubbed as witches and burnt at the stakes .			0

@entity5 mla @entity26 probably forgot that men and women are governed by different norms in @entity71
