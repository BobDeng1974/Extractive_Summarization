at first glance , it looks uncannily like a human brain			0
however , in fact this could be proof of the volcanoes that once flowed across the @entity7 surface			2
the huge circular area is nearly 2 kilometers ( 1.2 miles ) wide , and is described as a ' circular island ' by @entity10			1
the very high spatial resolution images from the @entity24 camera on board the @entity26 have revealed that all the flood features are draped by lava flows			1
this flow , near @entity16 , could be the youngest lava flow on @entity18			1
' it looks like a circular island surrounded by a ' sea ' of smooth - looking lava flows , ' @entity10 said			1
the @entity14 region where the unique shape was spotted contains some of the youngest lava flows on @entity18			1
' therefore , it is highly possible that volcanism played a role in creating this feature , ' @entity10 's experts claim			1
' perhaps lava has intruded underneath this mound and pushed it up from beneath			2
' it looks as if material is missing from the mound , so it is also possible that there was a significant amount of ice in the mound that was driven out by the heat of the lava			2
there are an array of features like this in the region that continue to puzzle scientists			2
' we hope that close inspection of this @entity24 image , and others around it , will provide some clues regarding its formation , ' they say			0
the @entity16 is an outflow channel on @entity18 , cut into its surface by catastrophic flooding			0
the very high spatial resolution images from the @entity24 camera on board the @entity26 have revealed that all the flood features are draped by lava flows			1
@entity24 is one of six instruments on @entity10 's @entity26			0
the 65 kg ( 143 lb ) , $ 40 million instrument was built under the direction of the @entity80 's @entity81 by @entity82 it consists of a 0.5 m ( 19.7 in ) aperture reflecting telescope , the largest so far of any deep space mission , which allows it to take pictures of @entity18 with resolutions of 0.3 m / pixel ( about 1 foot ) , resolving objects below a meter across			0
research published in january 2010 , described the discovery of a vast single lava flow , the size of the state of @entity96 , that ' was put in place turbulently over the span of several weeks at most			0
' the @entity14 region where the unique shape was spotted contains some of the youngest lava flows on @entity18 this flow , near @entity16 , is the youngest lava flow on @entity18			1
it is thought to be of @entity105			0
the floor of @entity16 is peppered with thousands of small cones and rings formed as steam exploded through the lava flow			0
because the flood - carved surface is now covered by lava , it is no longer easy to determine the age of the water floods that passed through @entity16			1
it is plausible that the flood was triggered by rising magma			0
around 80 % of the craters in @entity16 are secondary craters from the impact that created @entity124 crater .			0

circular feature is nearly 2 kilometers ( 1.2 miles ) wide on the @entity14 region of the red planet
experts say it is most likely to be a circular island surrounded by a ' sea ' of smooth - looking lava flows
the @entity14 region contains some of the youngest lava flows on the *martian* surface
