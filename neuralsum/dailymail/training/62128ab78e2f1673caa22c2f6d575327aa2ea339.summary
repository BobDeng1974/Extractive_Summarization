the @entity0 has found its first meteorite on the red planet – a hefty , shiny rock dubbed ‘ @entity4 ’			1
made mostly of iron , the impressive meteorite is 7 feet ( 2 metres ) wide and could help scientists uncover the reason why most meteorites on the red planet are iron rich			1
the rock has generated excitement in @entity11			0
on @entity14 , the rover 's handlers wrote : ‘ @entity15 ! i found an iron meteorite on @entity18 ’ , while @entity20 spokesman @entity19 described the rock as ‘ huge ’			1
this rock is an iron meteorite called ' @entity4 , ' similar in shape and luster to iron meteorites found on @entity18 by the previous generation of rovers , @entity26			1
the smaller piece in the foreground is called ' @entity29 ' the area highlighted shows the strange angular cavities in the surface of the rock images of the meteorite also revealed a smaller space rock nearby , which has been labelled ‘ @entity29 ’ mr @entity19 added that a third meteorite , which is also about 7 feet ( 2 metres ) wide and close to the @entity4 meteorites , may have been captured in a raw , unreleased image			1
the @entity4 image show strange angular cavities in the surface of the rock , similar to other iron meteorites previously observed by @entity26 rovers			1
‘ one possible explanation is that they resulted from preferential erosion along crystalline boundaries within the metal of the rock , ’ @entity20 said			2
the rock has generated excitement in @entity11			0
on @entity14 , the rover 's handlers wrote : ' @entity15 ! i found an iron meteorite on @entity18 ' , while @entity20 spokesman @entity19 described the rock as ' huge ' this is the first meteorite find for the @entity0 ( pictured ) which landed on @entity18 two years ago ‘ another possibility is that these cavities once contained olivine crystals , which can be found in a rare type of stony - iron meteorites called pallasites			1
’ @entity20 released a detailed photo of the @entity4 meteorites yesterday , however the curiosity rover made the discovery of the space rocks on may 25			1
they are the first space rocks on @entity18 discovered by the @entity0 since it landed on the red planet two years ago			2
iron meteorites are not rare among meteorites found on @entity69 , but they are less common than stony meteorites			0
on @entity18 , iron meteorites dominate the small number of meteorites that have been found			1
part of the explanation could come from the resistance of iron meteorites to erosion processes on @entity18			2
earlier this year , scientists in @entity78 claimed to have solved the mystery behind the ‘ blueberries ’ on @entity18			1
these marble - sized objects are remnants of small meteorites that broke up in the @entity18 atmosphere , they claimed			2
researchers had previously thought that the blueberries were evidence of water flowing over the martian surface billions of years ago the tiny sphericals were discovered on @entity18 by @entity20 ’s opportunity rover a decade ago near the @entity91 , and scientists have since been baffled by their origin			2
they seem to be crunchy on the outside , and softer in the middle , ’ @entity90 's principal investigator , @entity94 said			0
‘ they are different in concentration			0
they are different in structure			0
they are different in composition			0
they are different in distribution			0
so , we have a wonderful geological puzzle in front of us			0
’ according to the researchers , a meteorite 1.6 inches ( 4 cm ) in diameter could scatter a thousand 0.16 - inch spherules over a large area .			0

' @entity4 ' meteorite is *7ft* ( 2 metres ) wide and made mostly of iron
it could reveal the reason why most meteorites on @entity18 are iron rich
images also revealed a smaller space rock nearby , labelled ‘ @entity122 ’
scientists *suspect* a third meteorite , which is also about 7 feet ( 2 metres ) wide , has been captured in a raw image close to the @entity4 meteorites
