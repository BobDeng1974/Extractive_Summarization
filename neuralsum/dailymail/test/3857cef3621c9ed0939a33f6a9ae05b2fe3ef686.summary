a new study has suggested the oral contraceptive pill could shrink parts of the brain that govern a woman 's emotions for the 100 million women worldwide on the contraceptive pill , the side effects are familiar			1
mood swings , headaches and nausea , while more serious complications include blood clots and breast cancer			0
but scientists in @entity16 have added another potential cause for concern to the check list			0
their new study has found the oral contraceptive shrinks two key regions of the brain , changing the way they function			1
the findings suggest the synthetic hormones found in the @entity28 cause these alterations in brain structure and function			1
furthermore the ingredient is thought to suppress the natural hormones that occur when women take the @entity28			1
neuroscientists at @entity36 examined the brains of 90 women , 44 of whom took the @entity28 , and 46 who experienced natural cycles			1
they found the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the posterior cigulate cortex were thinner in those women taking the contraception			0
the lateral orbitofrontal cortex plays an important role in regulating a person 's emotions and their response to rewards			0
as a result the changes noted by researchers could , they say , be responsible for increased anxiety and depressive symptoms experienced by some women on the @entity28			1
meanwhile the posterior cingulate cortex governs the ' internal state ' , or inward - directed thought , helps process emotions and retrieve memories			0
@entity61 , the study 's lead author , told @entity63 : ' some women experience negative emotional side effects from taking oral contraceptive pills , although the scientific findings investigating that have been mixed			2
' so it 's possible that this change in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex may be related to the emotional changes that some women experience when using birth control pills			0
' researchers said they do not yet know if these changes to the brain are permanent , or if they only last while a woman is taking the @entity28			1
dr @entity79 said more research is needed , but added that this study is the first step			0
the latest study comes five years after research by the @entity86 revealed pill - users have a 12 per cent reduction in their risk of developing cancer			0
scientists at @entity36 found the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the posterior cigulate cortex were thinner in those women taking the contraception			2
they believe it could account for increased anxiety and depressive symptoms experienced by some women taking the pill the researchers studied 46,000 women across four decades , and found those on the pill were less likely to die of cancer , heart disease or stroke			1
it contradicts past studies that have linked the @entity28 to breast cancer			2
the risks associated with taking the @entity28 are increased if a woman smokes , has a family history of thrombosis , is severely overweight , diabetic , has a high blood pressure or high cholesterol level			2
the study was published in the journal @entity117 .			0

@entity36 study found the @entity28 shrinks two parts of the brain linked to emotion
synthetic hormones found in the contraceptive are thought to be to blame
believe it could account for increased anxiety and depressive *episodes*
