they say you ’re only as old as you feel			0
now scientists have discovered the adage might actually be true			2
a study showed those who feel younger than they really are have a better life expectancy			1
those who felt their age were more likely to die young – and people who felt older were at the greatest risk			1
scientists have found that the younger people feel the longer they live - and maintaining a healthy weight helped increase life expectancy psychologists say self - perceived age is a quick and easy way to predict longevity			1
they claim that feeling younger than your actual age could be a combination of healthy lifestyle factors and a greater ‘ will to live ’			2
the research involved 6,500 older adults taking part in the @entity25 , who were asked to assess how old they felt and their death rates were analysed			1
the study led by @entity30 ( @entity30 ) scientists follows previous research which linked happiness and having a sense of purpose in life with a lower risk of death			1
co-author @entity38 , @entity39 professor of psychology , said many older people feel younger than their actual age			2
he said ‘ people ’s judgements about how old they feel are likely influenced by a number of factors – aches and pains , serious illness , feelings of vitality , what sorts of social and physical activity we do , and so on			0
researchers asked 6,500 older people how old they felt then studied their health over an eight - year period ‘ what is interesting in this study is that when we took people ’s health state , mobility and functioning into account , we still found an association between feeling older than one ’s real age and greater mortality over the next eight years			1
‘ so some other factors seem to be contributing to the association between how old you feel and survival			0
‘ i do n’t think that people should worry about this			0
but it ’s certainly something that i as a medical researcher should try and understand			0
‘ the fact that such a quick and simple measure predicts longevity makes it worth pursuing			0
perhaps these feelings tell us something that other measures of health and wellbeing do not capture			0
’ of those who felt younger , 14 per cent had died in eight - year period compared to 25 per cent who said they felt older the study participants had an average chronological age of 65.8 years but their average self - perceived age was 56.8 years			1
almost 70 per cent felt three or more years younger than their actual age , while a quarter had a self - perceived age close to their real age			2
around one in 20 felt more than a year older than their chronological age , says a report in @entity100			2
death rates over a follow - up period of eight years were 14.3 per cent in adults who felt younger and 18.5 percent in those who felt about their actual age			1
the rate reached its highest level of almost 25 per cent in those adults who felt older than they really were , according to the study results			1
the relationship between self - perceived age and cardiovascular death was strong but there was no link between self - perceived age and cancer death			2
the report said maintaining a healthy weight and following medical advice were typical of the healthy living behaviours that were measured			1
but , it said , other factors might be influential such as ‘ greater resilience , sense of mastery and will to live ’ among those who feel younger than their age			0
‘ self - perceived age has the potential to change , so interventions may be possible			0
‘ individuals who feel older than their actual age could be targeted with health messages promoting positive health behaviours and attitudes toward aging ’ the study concludes			0
the study comes after the government has made a priority of improving national wellbeing through a series of measures at work and in the community .			0

scientists from @entity30 asked people how old they felt
they studied them for an eight - year period and analysed the death rates
of those who felt younger , 14 **%** had died compared to 25 **%** who felt older
@entity156 said maintaining healthy weight helped increase life expectancy
