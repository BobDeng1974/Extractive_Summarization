mrs @entity18 , a mother of one , had previously suffered sleep apnoea as a result of being overweight			1
she said : ' now , i have so much energy and just really enjoy life			2
i believe having the surgery has prolonged my life			2
' the couple and daughter @entity51 , 26 , used to live on takeaway food most nights but now eat healthy meals in small portions			1
they both began considering surgery after a holiday in the @entity60 last year			2
mrs @entity18 said : ' we got talking to another holidaymaker who had recently had weightloss surgery and was very pleased with the results and that set me off thinking			1
' when we got home , i said to @entity68 that i ’d been considering looking into having surgery and he actually said he ’s been thinking the same thing			2
' lifestyle change : mrs @entity18 , who works for @entity28 , used to eat takeaway meals every night with her family , but now has small healthy dishes in september last year , the couple went to see their gp			1

she added : ' i think the hardest thing was walking into the seminar for patients who are thinking about having surgery			2
' there were a lot of people there who were even bigger than me			0
it made me think , " i am not alone "			0
' @entity68 came along to support me at the seminar but we both felt even more strongly after the meeting and after receiving all the information , surgery was the best option for both of us			0
' you have to be really committed to change , i had to lose 5kg before the surgery and meet with a dietician to discuss the lifestyle changes you have to make after the operation			0
' since the operation i have lost 8st and i feel fantastic			1
i ’ve gone from a size 26 to a 14			0

the @entity149 ' surgeon @entity148 said : ' it is very pleasing to hear the success stories of our patients and to see the difference the surgery has made to the quality of their lives			0
' @entity11 and @entity68 know patients need to work hard to achieve the weightloss results that they want , but it does work and provides a long - term solution			2
' before undergoing gastric surgery for weightloss , patients need to have a body mass index of more than 40 , or more than 35 if they have other medical problems such as high blood pressure			0
mr @entity148 added : ' these patients will have tried everything beforehand and will have failed with conservative methods			0
