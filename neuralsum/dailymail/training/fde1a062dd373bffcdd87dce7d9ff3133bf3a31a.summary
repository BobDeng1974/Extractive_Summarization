by @entity0 published : 04:19 est , 31 may 2012 updated : 04:53 est , 31 may 2012 @entity1 : @entity2 says every motorist should be forced to take a breath test before setting off in his new book a former @entity7 chief drugs adviser who controversially claimed @entity8 is safer than drink has said alcohol sensors should be fitted in every car			1
professor @entity2 said all motorists would have to breathe into a device to prove they were not over the limit before their vehicle would start			1
but the call was today dismissed as ' impractical ' by the @entity17			1
the controversial professor was sacked as the @entity7 chief drugs adviser three years ago after claiming that drink was more harmful than @entity8			1
he also suggested that riding a horse was more dangerous than taking the banned @entity23 drug			0
the alcohol sensors plan is one of seven ways he suggests to reduce the harm caused by alcohol in his new book , @entity31			0
other suggestions include shorter licensing hours , compelling pubs and supermarkets to sell non-alcoholic lagers and beers alongside alcoholic drinks , and devising less dangerous alternatives such as drinks which give people a moderate ' buzz '			0
prof @entity2 is president of the @entity43 and a professor at @entity45 , @entity46			1
he told the @entity47 that some countries use the in - car breath - testers , known as alcohol ignition interlock devices , to ensure that people convicted of drink - driving do not take to the wheel , but he had an even more ' radical ' idea			2
he said : ' you could potentially have it so that was true of all cars - everybody would have to breathe in ( to the device ) before they were able to drive away			0
@entity62 : a motorist blows into an in - car breathalyser attached to the ignition			0
the car will not start unless the driver successfully passes ' you hear about terrible accidents when four or five young people die simultaneously in the one car because the driver ’s been drunk			0
it could save a lot of lives			0
' professor @entity2 has long courted controversy			1
under his stewardship , the @entity77 resisted the reclassification of cannabis and also called for @entity8 to be downgraded to a @entity82 substance			1
on both occasions he was overruled by ministers			0
but it was a paper he authored for the @entity86 at @entity87 , @entity46 , that proved the final straw			0
he accused former home secretary @entity89 , who reclassified cannabis , of ' distorting and devaluing ' scientific research , and said smoking the drug created a ' relatively small risk ' of psychotic illness			0
he also claimed those who wanted to move @entity8 into @entity82 from @entity23 - including himself - had ' won the intellectual argument '			1
most controversially , professor @entity2 said all drugs , including alcohol and tobacco , should be ranked by a ' harm ' index - with drinking coming fifth behind cocaine , heroin , barbiturates , and methadone			1
@entity106 - which prof @entity2 wants fitted to all cars - are attached to the ignition and do not allow the driver to start the engine until they have successfully blown into a tube			1
drunk crash : a national express coach on its side on a slip road off the @entity117 near @entity118			0
driver @entity119 was jailed however , critics have pointed to the fact that it is ludicrous to make all drivers blow into a tube every time they start a journey			2
the system will also fail to catch the most determined drunk drivers who could get a sober person - or even a child - to take the test for them			1
@entity132 began introducing the devices to their coaches last year to ensure their drivers are never over the limit			2
bosses took action after drunk driver @entity119 injured 33 passengers by flipping a coach onto its side as he left a motorway services on the @entity117 near @entity118 , @entity143 , in september 2007			0
the driver , who was one - and - a - half times the drink drive limit was jailed for ten months			2
@entity17 president @entity146 said today that introducing alcolocks to all cars was not a sensible idea			0
' there is a voluntary scheme of " alcolocks " at the moment but i do n’t think prof @entity2 ’s plan is practical , ' he said			1
' our message is that no one who drives should drink			2
if that message gets across and the police target drink - drivers and breathalyse more people , then you do n’t need new devices			1
' in @entity165 , drivers have to carry a breathalyser in the car			2
the problem here is that you could be under the legal drink - drive limit when you set off and then over the limit half an hour later , as it takes time for alcohol to get into the bloodstream			0

*aa* dismiss plans to force all drivers to take test before setting off as ' impractical '
prof @entity2 was sacked by the *government* three years ago for claiming drink was more harmful than @entity8 or @entity183
