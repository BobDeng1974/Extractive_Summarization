and we should never forget that the odds were stacked against her			2
she was the shopkeeper ’s daughter from @entity44 who made it to the highest office in the land			2
‘ there were people who said she could n’t make it ; who stood in her way ; who said a woman could n’t lead			2
‘ she will be remembered for the big political battles she fought			2
taking on the union barons			2
letting people buy their council homes			2
helping to win the @entity64			2
@entity1 took a country that was on its knees and made @entity10 stand tall again			2
’ mr @entity0 said it could not be denied that @entity1 ‘ divided opinion ’			1

’ sir @entity98 , @entity1 ’s successor , said : ‘ in government , the @entity10 was turned around under – and in large measure because of – her leadership			0
her reforms of the economy , trades union law , and her recovery of the @entity107 elevated her above normal politics , and may not have been achieved under any other leader			1

i want to focus on the enormous achievement of her first ten years			1

’ lord @entity147 , chairman of @entity148 , set up by @entity1 in 1974 , declared : ‘ everyone wants to be immortal			1
why ? because her values are timeless , eternal			1

the result was a revolution in economic policy and three election victories in a row			0
’ @entity165 , another former chancellor , said : ‘ the name @entity1 will always be synonymous with the word “ courage ”			0
the word impossible barely existed for her			0
we shall not see her like again			0
’ @entity170 , now minister without portfolio and one of @entity1 ’s @entity172 , said : ‘ it was conviction politics			1

‘ very few leaders get to change not only the political landscape of their country but of the world			0
@entity1 was such a leader			1
her global impact was vast			0
' and some of the changes she made in @entity10 were , in certain respects at least , retained by the 1997 @entity192 government , and came to be implemented by governments around the world , ’ he said			0
‘ as a person she was kind and generous spirited and was always immensely supportive to me as prime minister although we came from opposite sides of politics			1
’ thoughts : @entity230 ( pictured yesterday in @entity231 , @entity232 ) said she would ' remain a controversial figure ' @entity230 , @entity192 leader , said she would ‘ always remain a controversial figure ’			1
