by @entity0 published : 04:53 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 11:10 est , 15 august 2013 threats : @entity3 , seven , and sister @entity2 , four with their three - year - old neighbour @entity5 who have been threatened with @entity7 the parents of three young children are furious they have been given an ' intimidating ' police letter for playing outside			1
the letter , written by a police community support officer , highlighted alleged ‘ anti-social behaviour ’ near homes in @entity15 , @entity16			2
parents of @entity2 , four , and her sister @entity3 , seven , believe the police were referring to their children as well as neighbour @entity5 , who is just three years old			1
the letters said elderly neighbours had complained of ' minor damage ' to trees , the ' trampling of plants ' and ' slightly intimidating behaviour '			1
angry mother @entity28 , 30 , said : ' i 'm totally shocked			2
' the reason i know the letter is aimed at them is because they are the only children in the area who play in front of the houses			1
' there are other older children who live nearby , but they do not play near here			1
the older ones go to the local park			0
' while @entity5 's mother , @entity41 , felt her daughter , who does not start primary school for another year , had been branded ' a yob '			1
she said : ' @entity45 plays outside our home but she 's never caused any trouble			0
she 's the sweetest little girl you could hope for			0
' i ca n't believe the police are basically accusing her of being some kind of anti-social yob			2
' the letters were sent by a @entity56 from @entity57 to , who stated : ' reports have been received about a rise in anti-social behaviour			1
' it is understood that children like to play outdoors , however this has been observed to extend to minor damage to nearby trees and trampling of plants underfoot			1
@entity69 : @entity3 ( left ) , seven , and @entity2 ( right ) , four , with their neighbour @entity5 ( centre ) who is just three years old hold the @entity7 warning letter ' this is not an ideal situation and is perceived as slightly intimidating to elderly neighbours to see any large groups of children congregating			1
' if any subsequent damage is identified it may well be the case that @entity81 will be informed and indeed may act accordingly			0
' mrs @entity2 said she was stunned by the letter as most of her elderly neighbours enjoyed listening to the little children playing outside			1
she added : ' i 'm lucky i live in a road where they can safely play outside and i encourage them to play out as much as possible			0
the children pictured with their parents @entity28 and @entity91 and @entity92 ( far right ) ' during the school term they go out between 4pm and 5pm and during the holidays they go out at about 11am			2
' i do n't want them sat in the house all day watching tv			0
i would like to know who they can possibly intimidate in the area ? ' i realise now that they were not going to face @entity7 orders , but when you get a letter like that coming through your door , from the police , it scares you			0
' there are a lot of elderly people who live nearby , but there are no problems with most of them			0
' in fact , i think they like to hear the sound of children playing outside			0
' according to @entity121 , the letter was sent out to everyone in the area			0
superintendent @entity124 , who is in charge of policing in @entity127 , said : ' the neighbourhood police letter was a general reminder about anti-social behaviour ; it was not aimed at any family in particular			0
' there was no mention of @entity7 in the letter and , legally , we can not issue the orders to anyone under 10 - years - old ' he added : ‘ @entity121 take anti-social behaviour very seriously because of the negative impact it can have on our communities			0
parents @entity92 ( back left ) and @entity28 ( back right ) claim the children have done nothing wrong ' that said , we certainly do n’t want to stop children from enjoying the outdoors particularly during the summer months - but when we get reports of anti social behaviour from residents we understandably must act			1
' the letters were sent just a week after the @entity149 revealed that children in @entity151 had reclaimed three streets from traffic to mark @entity154			2
the event , last wednesday , mimicked a pioneering scheme from @entity157 where parents apply for licenses for regular street closures to encourage kids to play out .			2

parents of @entity164 , seven , and her sister @entity2 , four , were sent letters from police
mother of three - year - old @entity5 also issued with a warning
letters were sent from @entity56 from @entity57 in @entity173
parents thought elderly neighbours enjoyed listening to the children play
