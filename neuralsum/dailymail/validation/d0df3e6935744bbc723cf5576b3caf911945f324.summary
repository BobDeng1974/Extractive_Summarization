@entity0 : no charges were brought men accused of rape and other sex crimes should remain anonymous until they are charged , @entity2 demand today			1
they have urged a shake - up of the law after several high - profile figures were arrested and named , only to see their cases dropped			1
last year , @entity10 dj @entity0 told of the ‘ 12 months of horror and trauma ’ he suffered after his name was dragged through the mud following sexual assault accusations			2
police eventually told him he would not be charged			2
in january , @entity18 mp @entity17 called for those accused of rape to be allowed anonymity until they are charged after an accusation against him was dropped by police			1
but critics warned the move risked reducing the chance of serial rapists being convicted , and could endanger women who do not know a man has been accused of rape			2
they said that if predatory paedophiles such as @entity33 and @entity34 had been granted anonymity as suspects , other victims may not have come forward to help convict them			1
lifelong anonymity is granted to anyone who complains to police that they have been sexually assaulted			1
in may 2010 , the @entity40 vowed to reintroduce anonymity for rape suspects after it was dropped in 1988			1
but ministers faced huge opposition to the idea and axed it			1
in a report today , the @entity46 warned that a man accused of rape can suffer irreparable damage to his life , even if charges are never brought			2
it concluded that because of the stigma attached to rape accusations , it was unacceptable for suspects to have their identities publicised before they were charged			1
the mps face being accused of trying to curb the @entity60 by calling for zero tolerance of police who confirm the names of suspects to journalists other than in ‘ exceptional cases ’ – such as public safety			0
chairman @entity68 said : ‘ suspects deserve to remain anonymous until charged			2
police use of the “ flypaper ” practice of arresting someone , leaking the details then endlessly re-bailing them in the vague hope that other people come forward is unacceptable and must come to an end			0
critics say other victims may not have come forward if predatory paedophiles such as @entity33 , pictured left , and @entity34 , pictured right , had been granted anonimity ‘ it is inexcusable that information about suspects is released to the media in an unattributed way			1
we have seen how destructive this can be to a person ’s livelihood , causing irreparable reputational damage and enormous financial burden			0
’ the committee also said police bail should be capped initially at 28 days to end the scandal of officers leaving suspects to languish in legal limbo , sometimes for years			0
around 303,000 suspects a year are given police bail while officers investigate a crime			0
around 19,600 were bailed for more than six months – often with curbs on their freedom			0
but chief constable @entity102 , criminal justice spokesman of the @entity103 , said : ‘ some cases are complex , involving computers , forensics , @entity107 , interpreters , medical evidence or cross-agency work			0
these processes are time consuming			0
an initial 28 - day time limit would be unhelpful			0
we are working to ensure all cases are concluded as swiftly , fairly and transparently as possible			0
