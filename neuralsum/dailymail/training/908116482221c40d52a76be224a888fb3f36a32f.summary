joke : @entity1 has mocked parents at her daughter 's school for soliciting donations towards children 's birthday presents it would n’t be the first time a child ’s birthday party has led to a bust - up in the school playground			1
but in this case it ’s the parents who are at war – and one of them is broadcaster @entity1			1
she has angered fellow mothers by mocking emails two of them sent suggesting that other parents club together to buy their children birthday gifts , including a kindle			1
her sarcastic response , in which she said she was going to collect money to buy her seven - year - old daughter @entity30 a unicorn for her birthday , led to a confrontation with one of the mothers at the £ 5,000 - a - term school yesterday			1
problems began after 36 - year - old @entity38 , the former pop star turned @entity41 presenter , posted on social media two emails she had received ‘ from some school mums ’ , after first changing the names			2
the first email read : ‘ @entity48 and @entity49 would prefer a class birthday gift for their daughters this year			2
@entity53 would like a kindle and @entity55 a desk ( very studious choices ! ) so if you would like to join in , please can i collect a suggested £ 10 from you before the party on february 9			1
‘ if you prefer to send £ via an envelope in your daughters [ sic ] school bag , marked for @entity48 / me that works too			1
i will pass on a voucher and card to each at the party			2
@entity71 [ sic ] and no obligation of course			0
’ a second email from another parent who offers to collect the cash reiterates that £ 10 would be a ‘ popular amount ’ to contribute – meaning that the total value of the gifts would be at least £ 200 – but adds : ‘ feel free to give what you like or indeed , to give your own gift			1
’ shortly after , miss @entity1 published her stinging reply in which she said she was collecting ‘ unicorn money ’ towards a ‘ real , live unicorn ’ for @entity30			1
warming to her theme , she added : ‘ i ’d like a @entity87 and @entity88 , so by all means , do feel obligated to contribute to this too			0
’ and making it clear she thought the original request was bad manners , she ended her retort by saying the money could be donated to a fictitious site – www.getwhatyoure-givenandendthismadness.com			0
hours later , she was confronted in the playground as she picked up @entity30 from her school			1
a fellow parent , whose daughter was one of the subjects of the email , called across the playground : ‘ why did you do it , @entity1 ? why ? ’ miss @entity1 called back : ‘ if you ’ve got a problem with it , talk to me in private			1
’ other parents have written to the headteacher			0
@entity125 wrote : ‘ it was a very distasteful and cheap shot			0
’ another mother said : ‘ she has belittled us so publicly			0
lots of people have complained , ’ while a third added : ‘ she is n’t going to have any friends left			0
’ mother : ms @entity1 was making fun of parents whose children attend the same school as her daughter @entity30 gift - giving has become a big business in many top private schools as parents vie to curry favour with teachers			1
@entity146 magazine reported last year that some teachers had been given presents as lavish as £ 1,000 handbags , diamond necklaces and cases of vintage wine			0
at one school , parents even offered teachers the chance to use their private jet			2
a mother at a @entity104 prep school said that she was emotionally blackmailed into donating £ 90 - the minimum amount acceptable - to a fund for teachers ' gifts			1
some schools have had to introduce new rules capping the value of presents teachers can accept - at @entity167 , for example , staff must declare any gifts above £ 50			2
one defended the arrangement over buying presents , saying : ‘ it is to make it easier for parents so they do n’t buy expensive presents that nobody wants			2
@entity1 has misunderstood the school ’s community spirit			1
’ others claimed that the emails were actually a year old			0
on parenting website @entity186 , opinion was divided			0
one wrote : ‘ well good on her for shaming these grabby idiots			0
it ’s crass and rude to ask for money instead of a gift			0
’ another posted : ‘ one of the mums asked to do this at our school ! i think it ’s so rude ! ’ but others sided with the parents asking for money			2
one wrote : ‘ what ’s wrong with asking for contributions towards a larger present ? it seems much more sensible than getting 30 presents which you have to find room for and may not be played with			0
’ a spokesman for @entity38 , who also has a three - year - old daughter , hero , declined to comment			0
star : the entertainer rose to fame as a member of @entity215 and is now a television and radio presenter @entity218 : ms @entity1 has a show on @entity41 as well as hosting other tv and radio programmes			1

@entity223 was sent an email by mothers at her daughter 's school asking for donations towards a kindle and a desk for *pupils* ' birthdays
*message* suggested that parents should pay £ 10 each towards the gifts
ms @entity1 mocked the suggestion by sending a jokey email in response
claimed she would be collecting cash to buy her daughter @entity30 a unicorn
last month a schoolboy was charged £ 16 for missing his *classmate* 's party
