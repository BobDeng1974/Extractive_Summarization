by @entity0 published : 17:41 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 17:41 est , 12 november 2013 @entity2 's lawyers say prosecutors have failed to hand over evidence which could help them argue against the death penalty lawyers for @entity7 bombing suspect @entity2 renewed their accusations on tuesday that prosecutors are withholding evidence they need to defend their client against a potential death penalty			1
@entity2 's lawyers complained that prosecutors have failed to turn over several types of evidence they believe could help them argue against the death penalty , including information on a 2011 triple slaying in @entity20 in which @entity2 's older brother , @entity21 , is a suspect			1
@entity22 , one of @entity2 's lawyers , told the judge that the defense has also been frustrated by the government 's refusal to turn over the immigration files of @entity2 's family and friends , information she said could also be used to argue against the death penalty			1
' the government could provide it , and has not offered a single reason why it wo n't , ' she said			0
assistant u.s. attorney @entity35 countered that prosecutors have turned over ' virtually all of the mitigating evidence ' they have			0
' we have not withheld any favorable information from them , ' he said			0
the judge set a january 31 deadline for attorney general @entity45 to announce whether he will seek the death penalty for @entity2 , the @entity42 reported today			1
in court documents filed last month , prosecutors acknowledged that a friend of @entity50 told investigators that @entity21 participated in the unsolved killings of three men who were found in a @entity20 apartment with their throats slit and marijuana sprinkled over their bodies			0
@entity2 's lawyers argued in court papers that any evidence of @entity21 's involvement is mitigating information that is important as they prepare to defend his brother in the marathon bombing			2
his lawyers have n't said why they consider the evidence to be mitigating , but legal experts have theorized that the defense may be trying to show that @entity2 fell under the murderous influence of his older brother and that @entity21 was the driving force behind the marathon bombings			2
@entity73 reiterated the defense request tuesday and asked judge @entity75 to order prosecutors to turn over the records in the triple murder or at least review the file to see whether the information can be shared with the defense			0
federal prosecutors have said they wo n't provide the records because state prosecutors are in the middle of an ongoing investigation into the killings and releasing details could jeopardize the investigation			0
@entity7 bomber @entity50 is suspected of involvement in three murders , evidence of which the defense team claim is relevant in his younger brother 's trial authorities have alleged that the @entity2 brothers built and planted two pressure cooker bombs near the finish line of the april 15 marathon to retaliate against the @entity102 for @entity102 military action in @entity105 countries			2
the explosions killed three people and injured more than 260			0
@entity2 , his parents and siblings , ethnic @entity111 from @entity112 , came to the @entity102 about a decade ago and lived in @entity113			2
@entity2 , 20 , has pleaded not guilty to a 30 - count federal indictment that includes charges of using a weapon of mass destruction			2
seventeen of the charges carry a possible death penalty			1
prosecutors said they are in the process of completing their written proposal to @entity102 attorney general @entity45 , who will make the decision on whether to seek the death penalty against @entity2			1
@entity45 is expected to decide by january 31			1
@entity2 's lawyers also asked the judge to ease restrictions placed on @entity2 in prison , arguing that they are inhibiting their ability to defend him			1
the measures , which are often used in terrorism cases , restrict a defendant 's access to the mail , the media , the telephone and visitors			0
@entity75 took both defense motions under advisement and did not immediately rule			0
the judge rejected a request from prosecutors to schedule @entity2 's trial for next fall , saying it was too early to decide on a trial date			1
the next status conference was scheduled for february 12 .			0

judge today set a january 31 deadline for attorney general @entity45 to announce whether he will seek the death penalty for @entity2
