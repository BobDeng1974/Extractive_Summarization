pastor @entity0 has been confirmed as a @entity2 driver for the 2015 @entity4 season			1
the current campaign has been a troubled one for @entity0 and @entity2 so far , with the @entity6 yet to score a point for the @entity9 - based marque			1
but given @entity2 ' seemingly difficult financial circumstances at times , the money @entity0 brings with him from state - owned oil giant @entity13 helps considerably			0
staying put : pastor @entity0 will remain at @entity2 next season on track : the @entity6 is currently at @entity17 for the @entity18 @entity4 it means owner @entity20 has wasted little time in confirming one half of his driver line - up for next season			1
speaking to his team 's website , @entity20 said : ' i do n't want to give too much away , but as it 's halfway through the season i can confirm 50 per cent of our driver line - up for 2015 as @entity0 is with us for next year			2
' despite the difficulties we 've had so far this season , he recognises our true potential as a team and we recognise his true potential as a driver			0
' we will achieve great things together			0
' as for @entity40 , who @entity20 has previously claimed has the talent to drive for a bigger team , the @entity39 's future remains uncertain .			0
