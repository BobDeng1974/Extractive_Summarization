by @entity0 published : 10:58 est , 12 april 2012 updated : 13:21 est , 12 april 2012 lying in crumpled heaps , severed body parts strewn nearby , this is the terrible toll of the ivory trade on a once - thriving herd of elephants			2
thirty - five carcasses of the majestic gentle giants were found mutilated in a single attack by poachers at a popular safari destination in @entity12			1
the heart - breaking sight was captured by a photographer last month - 20 years after the global ivory trade was officially banned to protect @entity17 's herds			1
in the aftermath of the slaughter at @entity21 , a terrified young elephant was seen cowering around his mother 's corpse – the only living elephant the photographer saw in the park for a whole week			1
brutal : the shapeless and lifeless bodies of these once beautiful elephants are shown strewn across the national park having all been murdered disgusting : this poor animal 's trunk has been removed and discarded once its ivory has been taken local activists say 400 elephants may have been killed in this park alone since the beginning of the year – almost its total population according to the @entity38			1
this region of the country did contain @entity17 's largest population of savannah elephants			0
there are thought to be less than 5,000 elephants left in the whole country			0
@entity12 is one of a number of @entity49 countries whose elephants are at risk of extinction due to a spike in organised gangs of poachers targeting them for their tusks			1
hacked apart with most of their faces missing , they took chainsaws to the animals heads to reach the valuable ivory which sells for up to £ 10,000 for a large tusk – leaving a severed trunk nearby			0
poachers are often poor locals , but in this case they were a horseback - riding gang carrying machine guns , thought to have travelled 1,000 miles from @entity68 across @entity17 and @entity69 to reach this site			1
photographer @entity71 , who works for a local @entity73 fighting wildlife crime , captured these scenes in early march , at great personal risk after the site was sealed off by soldiers			1
while @entity12 authorities are now trying to police the park , campaigners fear it may be too little too late to save the once - numerous herds			1
shock : in spite of a worldwide ivory ban the slaughter of wild elephants for money by poachers carries on haul : the photographer discovers piles of tusks all taken by killing elephants illegally he said : ' there is a spike in poaching all over @entity17 , it is terrible at the moment			2
these are the sort of poachers you do not mess with			0
they are on horseback and have weapons			0
' they bribe local villagers with the elephant meat so they do n't tell the authorities and the result is more and more slaughtering of elephants			0
' journalists were kept away from the slaughter and they did not allow a census of all the dead elephants because of the negative image for @entity12			1
' in his view , backed up by the @entity38 which works in the country , the reason for the spike is clear – relentless demand for ivory from the @entity123 and particularly @entity124			0
with its peoples ' rising personal wealth and a taste for intricately - carved ivory jewellery and crockery , hundreds of tonnes is making its way to their shores			0
mr @entity71 said elite army units were sent to the @entity21 to secure the protected area and push the poachers out , but while they made them take flight , none were caught and one the army drivers was said to have been shot			0
he said : ' witnesses heard 63 shots from the camp during six long minutes of shooting			0
there were 35 dead at this site , and another 10 elephants a couple of kilometres away			2
they packed the tusks in maize bags			0
' they did n't catch them and the horsemen were seen riding @entity156 towards @entity157 [ nearby ] and asking villagers about the corridor for elephants			0
' solemn : a bystander sits surrounded by bodies in the elephant graveyard a @entity166 investigation screened last night found the global trade in ivory is at its worst since records after the 1989 ban , with incidents of elephant slaughter also on the rise in @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176			1
hauls of elephant tusks found at ports in @entity17 and @entity180 reached 24 tonnes last year , double the figure for 2010			2
the seizures equate to around 2,500 dead elephants in 2011 alone – and that 's only the ones they found			1
in @entity188 in northern @entity174 , where numbers of elephants have plummeted by a quarter in three years , camera crews were shown the carcass of a dead female elephant who was pregnant , and the remains of her unborn calf			2
reporters in @entity196 found ivory being carved by craftsmen and much of it sold without the official paperwork required to show it has been legally sourced			2
rise : a new @entity203 investigation found elephant numbers in @entity174 had dropped due to illegal killing many critics blame cites the international treaty which banned the global ivory trade , for a recent decision to allow @entity49 countries to sell stockpiled of ivory they had seized which may have driven up demand			2
dr. @entity214 , managing director of @entity38 's @entity216 program said the situation in @entity12 was ' the worst poaching massacre that i can recall in the decades we have worked to save elephants in @entity17 '			1
' poaching is escalating because of a growing demand for ivory from @entity180 and if we fail to take immediate action in the face of such plunder , then much of @entity17 's elephants could disappear forever to satisfy human greed ' , he said .			0
