by @entity0 published : 10:06 est , 21 may 2013 updated : 11:31 est , 21 may 2013 stunning images created using naturally occurring scientific phenomena such as how wind travels around @entity5 and how bacteria cells ' glide ' are among the entrants to this year 's @entity10 competition at @entity11			1
over 170 photos - all taken during scientific research - were entered into this year 's competition before judges whittled them down to the best 44 images , which are currently being displayed in a gallery on the university 's campus			1
students , staff and family members were then given the opportunity to vote for their favourites , and the winning entries have been made available online			2
the winning entry called @entity27 , @entity28 , was taken by @entity29 studying the @entity30 in @entity31 and @entity32			1
according to @entity29 , the winds around @entity5 are directed from west to east , or east to west			1
@entity29 's image shows the direction of the wind around @entity5 , averaged over time			1
the blue area shows wind travelling in east - to - west direction , the red areas show wind travelling west - to - east second place was awarded to 16 - year - old @entity43			1
his photo is an enhanced image of a crushed piece of birch wood			0
@entity43 explained : ' the dense cellular structure of wood is what protects it , in part , from microbes breaking apart cellulose and causing rot			0
in my materials science course we broke apart the cellular structure of birch by resorting to mechanical strength , crushing it along a specific direction and buckling the cellulose pathways that would normally be responsible for the distribution of water and nutrients to the rest of the tree ' @entity69 , @entity70 at @entity11 said : ' like art , science and engineering are deeply creative activities			1
' also like art , science and engineering at their very best are highly unpredictable in their outcomes			2
' the art of science exhibit celebrates the beauty of unpredictability and the unpredictability of beauty			2
' the winning image was taken by @entity29 from the program in @entity31 and @entity32			1
his image depicted the flow of the constant winds around @entity5 , averaged over time and he won Â £ 164 ( $ 250 )			1
second place went to 16 - year - old @entity43 from @entity94			1
he took a black - and - white photo of a crushed piece of birch wood for his entry and won Â £ 101 ( $ 154.51 )			1
this entry into @entity11 's art of science contest is called bridging the @entity102 and was taken by @entity103 and @entity104 of the @entity105			1
when drops of liquid are trapped in a thin gap between two solids , a strong negative pressure develops inside the drops			0
if the solids are flexible this pressure deforms the solids to close the gap			0
in @entity103 and @entity104 's experiment the solids were transparent , which allowed the pair to take photos of the drops from above			1
alternating dark and light lines represent lines of constant gap height			0
these lines are caused by light interference , which also causes rainbows or patterns in an oil slick bands of social bacterium @entity126 travel together			0
in order to hunt prey efficiently and protect one another , these cells coordinate the way in which they move - or ' glide '			2
in this image the gliding of hundreds of thousands of these cells was tracked over four hours			0
their paths transition from blue to red according to the amount of time it took , with blue as the start time and red as the end @entity146 photo called the history of @entity149 was taken by @entity150 and @entity151 from the @entity152 and the @entity153 for @entity154 @entity155 and @entity156 of the @entity157 and the @entity158 came third for their ' web of art and science ' image			2
their image was designed to show the similarities and differences of a website devoted to science , compared to one devoted to art and the pair won Â £ 62 ( $ 95.49 )			2
the gallery of images at the @entity173 on the @entity11 campus was opened on 10 may			1
all 139 attendees of the opening reception were given the chance to also choose the @entity179 winners			0
the favourites included an image of the nurse cells in a fruit fly ovary , light interference that looks like zebra print and photo called @entity187 that shows a mass of @entity190 worms			0
other entries that were handpicked but did n't win a prize include a goby fish peering from the centre of a coral , taken by @entity196 of the @entity197			0
the full list of entries is available on the art of science website			2
@entity202 from the @entity203 took this image called @entity205			0
it shows a reconstruction of a face from a blurred video			0
using a video containing a blurred , unrecognisable face , the data from individual video frames was combined to create a good approximation of what the original face looked like messenger meshwork by @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , and @entity221 from the @entity222			0
their image shows four nurse cells in a fruit fly ovary			0
each red or green dot is an individual @entity229 molecule , which is produced from @entity230 - shown in blue			2
the @entity229 molecules link together and move from one nurse cell to another , and then into the developing egg			0

more than 170 photos were entered into this year 's ' art of @entity10 ' contest at @entity11
the winning entry , by @entity29 , depicted the flow of wind as it moves around @entity5 - either from east to west or west - to - east
