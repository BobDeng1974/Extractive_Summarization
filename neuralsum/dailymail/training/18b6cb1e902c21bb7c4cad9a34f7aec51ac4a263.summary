yet there was no mention of their father , who will be eligible for release in two years			2
even the show ’s judges , cooks @entity68 and @entity69 , did not know about @entity2 ’s prison sentence until after the end of the series , in which they were won over by mrs @entity2 ’s ‘ sublime ’ cupcakes and ‘ outstandingly delicious ’ limoncello and white chocolate croquembouche			1
in one of the only interviews given since the show ’s final on october 4 , mrs @entity2 admitted that her husband had a conviction for ‘ fraud ’ and added : ‘ i was honest with the producers from the start but i did n’t want it to define me			1
