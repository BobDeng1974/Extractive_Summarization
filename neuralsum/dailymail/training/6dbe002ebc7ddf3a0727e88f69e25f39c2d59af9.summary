by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:06 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 19:19 est , 8 january 2014 sir @entity3 , the former chief scientific advisor to the government , has issued a warning about the future of fracking @entity9 would have to drill up to 2,000 shale wells a year to achieve a substantial drop in energy costs , according to experts			1
sir @entity3 , the government 's former chief scientist , suggested cost benefits from fracking may only be achieved with major disruption to the landscape			1
he expressed support for firms drilling to explore the size of the @entity9 's reserves which could reduce reliance on imported gas from @entity24 and @entity25			1
but he warned those expecting gas prices to plummet as in the @entity27 , that the far higher concentration of people and resulting planning issues in @entity9 would make it very difficult to do it ' on anything like the same scale ' and raise problems with ' social acceptance			1
' @entity37 has embraced fracking - horizontal drilling to extract natural gas from shale rocks thousands of feet underground			1
the prime minister said last year : ' i think we would be making a big mistake as a nation if we did not think hard about how to encourage fracking and cheaper prices right here in the @entity9			1
' if you look at what 's happening in @entity27 with the advent of shale gas and fracking , their energy costs in business and their gas prices are half the level of ours ' but sir @entity3 , who is @entity60 's special representative on climate change , said : ' if we were looking at an expectancy of a thousand or two thousand wells a year - which would have an impact on our economics - it would be very difficult to foresee how that could happen in @entity9			1
' he added : ' i 'm all for exploring shale gas in the @entity9 , i think there is a potential there			1
' i see it as a relatively medium term potential , i do n't think it 's going to continue well into the future - but i think there is an economic advantage from being able to produce a primary energy source within the @entity79 , obviating the need to import			1
' but i would caution the extent to which this can have a dent on our economics , simply because i do n't think that we can frack on anything like the scale that is taking place in the @entity27			0
' he told a @entity90 committee that in the @entity27 , where up to 30,000 wells are drilled per year ' there has been quite an outcry among the population ' in built - up areas			0
in @entity97 in @entity98 , drilling by the firm @entity96 was ground to a halt by protestors last year			0
quadrilla drilling site where protestors took action at the fracking site in @entity97 in @entity106 @entity108 - owned energy giant @entity107 has snubbed a government call to give a £ 50 price cut to all customers			1
five weeks ago , the chancellor announced a change in @entity115 and @entity116 levies that were designed to cut the bills of all families struggling to pay for heat and light by £ 50			0
however , @entity107 , which is @entity9 's most expensive energy firm , said yesterday ( thrs ) that some 500,000 customers on fixed rate deals will only get a reduction of £ 12			2
at the same time , 54,000 households who only get their gas for central heating and hot water from @entity107 will not get any reduction at all			2
the full £ 50 reduction is being reserved for dual fuel customers on a variable tariff who suffered an average price rise of 10.4per cent in december			0
the two biggest suppliers , @entity137 and @entity138 , are giving a £ 50 cut to all customers , however , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 and now @entity107 , say they will not			0
each well requires tons of sand and water delivered in lorries used to crack open the rocks , he said , which causes damage to roads and problems with ' social acceptance '			0
and the gas produced from each well drops by around 70pc after the first year , he said			2
' if you want to keep up production you need to keep up fracking			2
' professor @entity161 , chief scientific officer at the @entity162 , told peers that the @entity9 's shale gas reserves are estimated to be around a third of the size of those in the @entity168			1
but he said how much could be extracted , and the impact on energy prices , would remain ' extremely uncertain ' until the first 20 to 40 wells are drilled in the coming years			2
the @entity9 will remain heavily dependent on gas , which currently produces around a third of our energy , ' for many decades ' for industry and heating systems '			2
hence , he said : ' we must have an energy policy that adds up ... it seems a reasonable thing to do to try and source our gas domestically			0
the alternative will be an increasing dependence on other countries such as @entity25 and @entity185 and @entity24 for gas			0
' both experts played down concerns that fracking could lead to water contamination or earthquakes saying @entity9 regulations were strong enough to guard against it			0
@entity115 groups are against fracking , saying it will make it difficult to meet the legally binding target to cut carbon emissions by 80pc by 2050 - and urge investment in wind and solar farms instead			0
but the government 's independent climate advisor , former @entity204 minister @entity203 , said campaigners with a ' theological objection ' to fracking are ' just factually wrong '			1
he told mps at another energy committee yesterday that gas has a valuable part to play in the economy .			0

sir @entity3 issues warned to those expecting gas prices to plummet
government 's former chief scientist however does support fracking
