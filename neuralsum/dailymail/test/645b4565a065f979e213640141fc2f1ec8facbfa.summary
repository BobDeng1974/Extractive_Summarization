some of our most spectacular views of @entity2 have been presented on small , skinny strips of imagery			1
now , for the first time , scientists have joined these individual 30 to 60 mile ( 50 to 100km ) wide strips to create a single complete 3d map			2
the new map allows astronomers to ' stand ' on planetary surfaces and could help explain how water and lava once flowed across the red planet			1
pictured is a view of a section of the image map @entity25 ' is on the right and the topographical view can be seen on the left			0
the warmer colours show a higher elevation the colour - coded terrain models show the impressive height of the @entity34 region at up to 820ft ( 250 metres ) above the surface , seen in red			1
this is in contrast to the blue 1,6404ft ( 5,000 metres ) depth of the lower - lying @entity41 region			1
the first mosaic , pieced together by the @entity43 ( @entity43 ) , comprises 1.4 million square miles ( 2.3 million square km ) of the surface			1
it covers the vast crater - strewn highland region of the red planet , parts of the @entity51 outflow channel , the chaotic @entity40 as well as the @entity34 and @entity41 plains			1
the new map allows scientists to ' stand ' on planetary surfaces and could help explain how water and lava once flowed across @entity2			1
pictured is a colour - coded perspective view showing the topography of the upper course of @entity51 near the @entity41 plains constructing a 3d model such as this requires a spacecraft to look at the same surface feature twice at a different angle			1
the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) on @entity69 is the only experiment that can do it with just one pass			0
@entity68 has nine scan lines that point fore , aft and straight down			0
this allows it to see a feature on approach , when its underneath and as it fades into the background			0
@entity68 has , during 14,000 orbits , transmitted 293.34 gigabytes of data to @entity82			0
' @entity83 and @entity84 measured @entity82 , and with our survey of @entity2 we are following in their footsteps , ' says @entity89 , a @entity43 planetary scientist			1
the mosaic extends over 1,120 miles ( 1800km ) from north to south and 810 miles ( 1,300km ) from east to west			2
individual stereo and colour images from a total of 89 @entity2 orbits were combined to create the map			2
' the strips were recorded at varying resolutions , with the sun at different positions and under varying weather conditions , ' @entity89 said			0
' the challenge was to combine them uniformly and without visible borders to form one large image			0
' perspective views look into the @entity51 outflow channel or into a crater altered by typical @entity2 erosion processes typical on @entity2			2
' at present , you can not create a better image of the surface of @entity2 to show , for example , of the effects of flood and drought , ' said @entity89			2
pictured are parts of the @entity51 outflow channel			0
constructing a 3d model such as this requires a spacecraft to look at the same surface feature twice at a different angle			0
@entity68 on @entity69 is the only experiment that can do it with just one pass the data for this wide - area topography of @entity2 was acquired by @entity128 ( @entity68 , ) which has been orbiting the red planet since 2003			1
nine sensors record the surface of the planet from different angles and make it possible to map our planetary neighbour at high resolution , in colour , and in the third dimension â€“ elevation			0
@entity68 has , during the course of more than 14,000 orbits , recorded and transmitted a total of 293.34 gigabytes of data to @entity82			0
about 97 percent of the planet has been recorded with image resolutions of up to 330ft ( 100 metres )			0
by around 2018 , the team from @entity43 , wants to represent the whole of @entity2 as one coherent mosaic			1
pictured is the the strip up top of @entity152 , showing the @entity51 region , in the context of the rest of the region covered by the @entity43 's wide area topography survey			2
by around 2018 , the team from @entity43 , wants to represent the whole of @entity2 as one coherent mosaic			1

the *stunning* mosaic could help scientists better understand how water and lava once flowed across @entity2
terrain model shows the impressive height of the @entity34 region at up to 820ft ( 250 metres ) in red
colder colours *reveal* craters , *ditches* and plains , which are particularly prominent in @entity41 region
in three years , the @entity43 wants to represent the whole of @entity2 as one coherent mosaic
