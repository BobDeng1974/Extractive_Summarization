by @entity0 universities will struggle to fill their places because teenagers are increasingly choosing vocational courses instead of traditional a-levels , a report warned today			1
teenagers face finding it harder to win degree course places because growing numbers are shunning a-levels in favour of options such as @entity14 - perhaps to dodge attempts to make a-levels tougher			1
as the popularity of a-levels has dipped , the number of top a * grades awarded has slumped nine per cent in just two years			1
teenagers face finding it harder to win degree course places because growing numbers are shunning a-levels in favour of vocational options such as @entity14			1
the trends emerged in a report for @entity30 ( stock image ) universities are now preparing to look elsewhere in the @entity33 for undergraduates amid increasing competition among campuses for home - grown students			1
the trends emerged in a report for vice-chancellors ’ group @entity30 ( @entity30 ) just a week before sixth - formers across the country receive their a-level results			0
it reveals that universities have identified ‘ key challenges ’ in their efforts to recruit enough students to courses			2
these include a decline in the overall population of teenagers and ‘ changes in entry qualifications ’ including a shift towards @entity14 qualifications			1
while demand for university appears to have recovered since £ 9,000 - a - year tuition fees were imposed , there is forecast to be a ‘ weakening in demand ’ for full - time degrees among ‘ traditional populations ’			0
the report notes that a-levels are still the most widely - held qualification among young entrants to university , with 56.6 per cent declaring them as their highest qualification			0
but it also reveals that the number of a-level exams taken by @entity78 candidates declined 1.9 per cent between 2011 and 2013 , with top a * and a grades falling particularly sharply – by nine per cent and 2.4 per cent respectively			2
this year ’s results are expected to show a steeper fall in entries of about three per cent			0
but the proportion being accepted to university with @entity14 has nearly doubled in five years , from three per cent in 2008 to 5.8 per cent in 2013			2
the trend towards @entity14 will dismay traditionalists who see them as easy alternatives to a-levels			1
one teacher has labelled them the qualification equivalent of a ‘ sub-prime mortgage ’			0
some have predicted a growth in @entity14 numbers as pupils attempt to avoid reforms to a-levels set in train by former education secretary @entity101			1
some experts have predicted a growth in @entity14 numbers as pupils attempt to avoid reforms to a-levels set in train by former education secretary @entity101 ( above ) pupils already have fewer chances to resit and revamped a-levels being phased in from next year will feature a return to end - of - course exams instead of bite - sized modules and new demanding content compiled by universities			1
the report warns that ‘ changes in student attainment ’ have been identified by vice-chancellors as a ‘ potential challenge for recruitment in future ’			0
‘ in particular vice-chancellors noted the shifting balance between traditional qualifications for entry into higher education , such as a-levels , and other level three qualifications , ’ it said			2
universities face further turbulence due to @entity133 moves to unleash market forces in higher education , which will remove a strict cap on recruitment and allow private providers to compete with established institutions			1
they will increasingly look elsewhere in the @entity33 to ensure their courses are filled , it emerged			0
‘ a number of vice-chancellors noted undergraduate recruitment from the @entity33 as a potential opportunity for growth , particularly in the context of increased competition among higher education institutions , and decreasing supply of @entity78 - domiciled undergraduates due to the demographic dip in young students , ’ the report said			1
the report follows warnings from @entity156 , the university admissions service , that pupils with @entity14 qualifications were practically guaranteeing rejection from top universities , and limiting progression at middle - ranking institutions			1
pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds were more likely to hold vocational qualifications , which were virtually shunned by independent schools			0
@entity168 , @entity156 chief executive , warned last year it was ‘ quite clear that higher - tariff institutions want to recruit those with academic qualifications such as a-levels ’			2
‘ i think it ’s worth thinking about - if you have a done a btec in health and social care , you are very likely to progress on to a course in higher education in health and social care whereas if you ’ve got three a-levels , you ’ve got a choice of probably literally thousands of different courses to choose from			1
so it ’s also a narrower progression route , ’ she said			0
and she warned : ‘ we all know about new tougher , more rigorous a-levels and these indeed might be desirable in themselves but i ca n’t help anticipating that a public understanding that a-levels are getting more difficult is likely to increase this big trend towards vocational qualifications that we ’ve seen			2
’ earlier this year , she said applications received by @entity156 indicated a further drop in the total of students predicted to score three a grades this summer			0
‘ taking into account the shrinking population , in five years ’ time there could be 10,000 fewer @entity201 19 – year – olds with @entity203 and more than 20,000 more holding vocational qualifications			0
the trend could restrict recruitment at more selective universities , ’ she said			0
the report coincided with separate research which delivered a stark warning to the government over its policy of scrapping controls on student numbers and allowing universities to recruit as many undergraduates as they like			0
the @entity217 cautioned that costs could ‘ spiral ’ and the policy had been ‘ put together quickly and remains fuzzy ' .			0
