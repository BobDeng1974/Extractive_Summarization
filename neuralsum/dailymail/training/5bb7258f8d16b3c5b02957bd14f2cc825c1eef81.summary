by @entity0 even at the best of times , it is hard to tell from @entity4 ’s strangely taut , perma - tanned face exactly what he is thinking			1
it is a mask of inscrutability that , no doubt , comes in handy during the negotiations the management @entity11 conducts on a daily basis for his roster of sporting and showbusiness stars			0
but there was no hiding his unadulterated glee as @entity4 watched from the players ’ box as his client @entity21 became the first @entity23 man since 1936 to reign supreme at @entity24			1
@entity4 arriving at 10 @entity25 ahead of a reception with @entity21 following his @entity24 win indeed , look closely and it was almost possible to see the pound signs in @entity4 ’s eyes			1
because for @entity21 — and his delighted manager — the tills are set to start ringing like never before			1
already big - money offers are coming in			0
and they could boost the tennis player ’s fortune from its current £ 32 million to upwards of £ 200 million , say experts			1
‘ it is on a par with winning the @entity43 — it ’s very exciting , ’ @entity4 says of the 26 - year - old @entity40 ’s historic win			2
‘ @entity21 will hopefully achieve all the things that come with success			2
’ by that , of course , he is talking about oodles of cash — a sizeable chunk of which will boost @entity4 ’s £ 375 million fortune for providing his expert advice			1
such vast wealth has been achieved through the savvy marketing of his a-list clients , who include @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60			2
and @entity4 rarely misses an opportunity to promote those he represents			0
just look at the @entity63 during the men ’s final			0
there , stealing attention in a skimpy black negligee dress from her own collection , was @entity70 — another signed to @entity4 ’s company , @entity71			1
there was no hiding his unadulterated glee as @entity4 watched from the players ¿ box as his client @entity21 became the first @entity23 man since 1936 to reign supreme at @entity24			1
@entity21 broke down in tears after he won the final at last , but he is set to make millions following the event @entity81 happened to wear a dress designed by @entity4 client @entity70 as she watched her boyfriend win @entity24 it seems her appearance — and all the free publicity it brought her clothing line — had as much to do with puppet - master @entity90 - pulling as it did with @entity70 ’s love of tennis			1
indeed , she spent much of the match on her mobile phone			0
likewise , @entity21 ’s girlfriend @entity81 , whose roller - coaster of emotions during the match was beamed to millions of television viewers around the world , just happened to be wearing a green lace dress designed — you ’ve guessed it — by @entity70			1
last year , 25 - year - old miss @entity103 sported a succession of dresses by @entity108 designer @entity107 — who is also a client of @entity4			2
none of which is surprising , perhaps , given that miss @entity103 , like @entity21 ’s mother , @entity112 , and brother , doubles tennis player @entity114 , is advised by @entity4 as well			1
such corporate symbiosis might seem from the outside to be more than a little cynical , but it is undoubtedly good for business			0
yesterday , @entity4 arrived in a @entity119 to attend a reception at 10 @entity25 , hosted by @entity121 , to celebrate @entity21 ’s win — a victory that is the culmination of five years ’ hard work from @entity4 and his team as they have assiduously gone about trying to mend the @entity127 ’s dour image to make him more appealing to sponsors			1
stars @entity58 and @entity70 are both clients of @entity4 @entity60 ( left ) and @entity59 ( right ) are both clients , helping @entity4 generate his massive fortune it has not always been an easy sell			1
indeed , last autumn when @entity21 ’s contract with @entity71 was up for renewal , there was speculation in the sports management industry that he was planning to dump @entity4 because his on - court success — winning @entity142 gold and the @entity143 last summer — had not translated into significantly increased earnings away from the sport			1
all that is about to change			0
@entity4 , who persuaded @entity21 to stay on his roster , is already fielding calls from eager brands who want to have their names associated with the @entity24 champion			1
among them is @entity154 , who have already opened talks about renewing @entity21 ’s five - year , £ 15 million deal , which expires at the end of 2014			1
his new contract , which is likely to more than double in value , is set to make him a global brand ambassador			0
his deal with the sportswear giant is joined by a three - year deal with @entity167 watchmaker @entity166 — signed last june — and worth £ 9.9 million			0
he also gets £ 2 million a year from @entity168 as well as contracts with racquet maker @entity170 and @entity173 cars			0
all of which brings @entity21 in around £ 10 million a year			1
in recent months , @entity4 has held off signing up @entity21 to any new sponsorship deals , gambling on the fact that a win at @entity24 would massively inflate his future bankability			2
that is set to sky rocket thanks , in part , to a deal @entity4 negotiated this year to form a partnership with @entity186 doubles player and entrepreneur @entity184			2
a new company , @entity187 , will focus on developing @entity21 ’s commercial interests in the highly lucrative @entity189 and the @entity191 markets			2
@entity4 planned on softening the @entity127 's personality by allowing the documentary @entity21 : the man behind the racquet in the programme , the normally reserved @entity21 broke down in tears as he discussed the killing of 16 children by @entity200 in his native @entity201 in march 1996			1
viewers were given a more personal insight into the character of @entity21 it is just part of the strategy to turn @entity21 into a global money - making machine			0
@entity210 to the campaign have been the concerted attempts by @entity4 and his team to soften his client ’s outwardly less than sparkling personality			2
hence the decision to allow @entity217 fly - on - the - wall cameras to follow the player for the recent documentary , @entity21 , @entity220			1
in the programme , the normally reserved @entity21 broke down in tears as he discussed the killing of 16 children by @entity200 in his native @entity201 in march 1996			0
@entity21 , who was eight at the time and a pupil at the local primary school which was the scene of the massacre , escaped the gunman by hiding in the headmaster ’s office			2
such manipulation of the media has long been 53 - year - old @entity4 ’s stock in trade			2
he managed the @entity235 , created teen band @entity236 , and launched @entity237 in 2001 , which went on to be sold to 46 countries around the world			0
but he fell out with his former business partner @entity241 , who acted as a judge on the @entity23 and @entity244 versions of the shows , after @entity241 launched his own rival show , @entity247 , in 2004			0
the feud has hardly dented @entity4 ’s bank balance			2
in 2005 , he sold @entity250 for £ 130 million and later launched @entity71			0
unlike the stars he promotes , @entity4 likes to keep his private life below the radar			0
in 2008 , he married blonde interior designer @entity254 , who is 18 years his junior , and the couple now have a two - year - old daughter			0
his reticence , does not however , extend to his assessment of his own talent			0
‘ my business is creating fame and celebrity , and i ’m one of the best in the world , ’ @entity4 says			0
‘ i understand popular entertainment better than anyone			0
i want to have the world ’s @entity269 tennis player , the hottest movie , the biggest artist			1
’ one thing that seems certain is that thanks to his @entity24 success , @entity21 and the man pulling his strings are about to get even richer .			0

@entity21 's delighted manager @entity4 may be set to cash in
could boost the tennis player ’s fortune from £ 32 million to £ 200 million
it is no *coincidence* that @entity81 wore a @entity70 dress
the designer and her *husband* @entity58 are managed by @entity4
@entity4 aimed to soften @entity21 's image and allowed him to appear in a @entity217 documentary
