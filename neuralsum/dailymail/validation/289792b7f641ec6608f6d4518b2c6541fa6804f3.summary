while giving back to the community both practically and financially is an admirable pursuit , many people may be going about it the wrong way			2
@entity5 founded charity @entity6 after spending 22 years with the @entity9 leading teams in response to acts of terrorism and natural disasters , and says that many @entity14 approach charity work as a one - day - a - year commitment			1
' if people think that they are going to go to a charity and create significant change in one day then they are naive at best , and arrogant at worst , ' mr @entity5 told @entity20			1
@entity5 founded charity hands across the water , after responding to the @entity23 ' i 'm involved with a food van in @entity26 that operates seven nights a week to feed the homeless			1
there is a core group of volunteers but at @entity33 time we are swamped with people wanting to help out , ' mr @entity5 said			1
' homeless people need to be fed all year , so is it about the people you are looking to support or is it about you ? i was always a bit mystified and i feel like people want to do it so they can talk about what they 've done at the next cocktail party they go to , ' he said			0
as part of the leadership team that responded to the @entity48 bombings in 2002 and the @entity23 , mr @entity5 has had almost 30 years experience responding to people in need			1
the @entity53 finalist and @entity55 medal recipient has made it his life 's goal to bring effective and meaningful change to the lives of those who need it the most , and believes that a different approach to charity work needs to be adopted			2
in his new book , doing @entity66 for doing @entity66 , mr @entity5 says that people can be a ' waste of space ' when they volunteer if they are n't committed to doing something of value , and are only interested in how their charity work makes them look			1
mr @entity5 is an @entity53 finalist and @entity55 medal recipient hands over the @entity22 was founded in 2005 and has set up several orphanages around @entity76 the charity has raised over $ 10 million without spending any donor money on administration costs ' there are many @entity83 ( @entity83 ) programs that allow employees to give up one day a year to volunteer , but it 's essential to consider how effective that one day is , ' he said			1
' if you were to turn up to someone else 's workplace as an unskilled worker , they would spend the day giving you training , showing you around , getting you familiarised , only to have you leave			0
' mr @entity5 is passionate about creating meaningful experiences for those who volunteer , the workplaces who send them , and the charity , in order that everyone involved gets the ' best value ' out of the exchange			1
while it may seem a clinical approach to giving back to the community , mr @entity5 said that it is crucial for businesses and individuals to make decisions about how to contribute with both the heart and head , so that the biggest impact is made on those who need it			1
' for companies involved in @entity83 it would be much more effective to give 50 employees a day off each week or month to volunteer so that they are plugged in and contributing , rather than giving 300 employees one day off a year , where many will not be interested or adding value , ' mr @entity5 said			1
' for many people their intent is pure but it 's just unrealistic to be effective in one day , ' he said			0
mr @entity5 spent 22 years with the @entity9 leading teams in response to terrorism acts and disasters he was involved in leading teams responding to the 2002 @entity48 bombings and the @entity129 mr @entity5 is passionate about creating meaningful experiences for those who volunteer for charities in 2005 , mr @entity5 founded @entity6 , a charity most recently recognised for raising funds for @entity135 , the little boy with @entity137 at the centre of the @entity76 surrogacy scandal			1
today , the charity is one of the fastest growing not - for - profit organisations in the country , and relies on donations from generous @entity14 to continue it 's good work			2
however , mr @entity5 has set up the charity so that people who want to give can be actively involved in seeing where their money goes , and maintains that simply giving money to a worthy cause can be an empty move			1
' it 's like a warm bath - you feel good when you are in it but half an hour later the water is cold and the feeling is gone , ' he said			0
' there 's no engagement when companies or individuals simply hand over money and walk away			0
it 's important to create opportunities for shared experiences so that people can have their own stories and engage more strongly with what they are giving to			2
' mr @entity5 said that while donations are the backbone of charities and essential for their work , people will be less likely to keep giving if they do n't have a relationship with the charity			1
mr @entity5 is passionate about people engaging with where and to whom their money goes to the @entity23 tsunami of 2004 resulted in the deaths of 230,000 people in 14 countries @entity76 was one of the worst affected nations - 25,000 people were killed , presumed dead , or displaced ' some charities tend to focus on the work they are doing rather than recognising and embracing the donors			1
the work that hands over the water does in @entity76 would be impossible without this , ' he said			0
when the @entity23 tsunami of 2004 hit , it resulted in the deaths of 230,000 people in 14 countries , with @entity76 as one of the worst affected nations - 25,000 people were killed , presumed dead , or displaced			0
when mr @entity5 was in @entity76 eight months after the tsunami hit , he was struck by the plight of the children in the area who had lost their parents and had no one to care for them			2
' after a big crisis people turn up to help , but charities and government authorities and @entity209 's all leave too quickly			0
if you want to make long term change you need to make a long term committment , and so we started raising funds for these kids - and a year later built a house for them , ' mr @entity5 said			2
' but it was only when we opened the home that we realised that they needed more funds for operating , and children kept coming in			0
i was naive , i thought that if we built them a home all their problems would go away , ' he said			0
mr @entity5 realised that simply giving money and leaving them was not an option , or an effective way to create change in the lives of the children			2
@entity6 is passionate about providing engagement with their donors , and operates bike rides around @entity76 for those who are keen to both raise money for the charity and see in person the projects that their money goes towards			0
' we run a @entity247 ride as an alternative for high school leavers , so instead of heading up to the @entity250 , which i do n't think is all that memorable , they can head on a five - day bike ride and end at one of our orphanages , ' mr @entity5 said			2
mr @entity5 has released his latest book , doing @entity66 by doing @entity66 , which it out now mr @entity5 said that many @entity14 approach charity work as a one - day - a - year commitment ' these rides have been hugely successful , and when we launched our rides in january both sold our in 90 minutes and we have return rate of 73 % of people , ' he said			1
the charity has raised over $ 10 million without spending any donor money on administration costs , and has set up a company to sit alongside the charity to provide a sustainable income to employ a full - time worker and continue the maintenance of @entity6			0
with the money the charity has built several orphanages , providing a home to several hundred children each night in @entity76 , and has also constructed a medical and community centre in the @entity278 region of the nation			0
mr @entity5 said that the way people have engaged with the charity after seeing the work it is doing is indication that people need to understand where their money is going , and highlights how important it is to make sure donating is n't an empty experience			1
' when people want to give money , it 's important that they do their research			0
the first one they come across may not be the right one , ' he said			0
' if you give to a charity or want to volunteer , make it the right one so you do it for longer			0
' doing @entity66 by doing good by @entity5 is out now .			0
