by @entity0 instead of giving their real names , the cheeky police note was signed ' love from @entity5 and @entity6 ' being drunk and running into the police would normally spell trouble for most revellers			1
but one man found that instead of being slapped with a fine after getting a little worse for wear , instead he got a humorous handwritten note from concerned police officers who had driven him home			1
a man , known only as @entity16 from @entity17 , woke on sunday morning following a heavy night out to discover a note from ' @entity19 ' who had given him a lift after discovering him too drunk to stand			1
but instead of giving their real names , the note referred to the 1980s series about female @entity26 detectives starring @entity27 and @entity28			1
the letter , on @entity31 notepaper and addressed to @entity16 , explained he had been found barely able to stand shortly after 2am on sunday ( january 12 )			1
it said : ' we found you staggering in the road on your way home from @entity17			2
' you were so drunk we were worried you would n’t get home in one piece ! so we gave you a lift home			2
' please do n’t get that drunk again			0
