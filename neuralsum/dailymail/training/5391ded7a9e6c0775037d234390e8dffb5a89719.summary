by @entity0 published : 00:00 est , 1 march 2013 updated : 08:25 est , 1 march 2013 the @entity1 said on thursday it would resume flights of its @entity4 fighter jets following a week - long precautionary grounding imposed after a crack was found on an engine blade on a test plane in @entity9			1
' f - 35 flight operations have been cleared to resume , ' @entity1 spokeswoman @entity10 said in a statement			2
she said flights could begin as early as friday , depending on weather conditions			0
no additional cracks were found during inspections of engines on the remaining 50 planes in the @entity1 's fleet , or any spare engines , @entity10 said			2
last friday the @entity1 grounded its entire fleet the fighter jets after discovering a cracked engine blade the order allowing flights to resume is good news for the $ 396 billion @entity4 , the @entity1 's biggest weapons program which is bracing for big cutbacks when automatic across - the - board budget cuts take effect on friday			1
it comes two days after the @entity1 's f - 35 program chief blasted engine maker @entity35 and prime contractor @entity36 for trying to ' squeeze every nickel ' out of the @entity1 and not shouldering enough risk on the program			1
the order ends the program 's second engine - related flight ban in less than two months			2
the @entity45 version of the plane was grounded for nearly a month from mid-january because of a faulty hose in the engine , later blamed on manufacturing errors			0
impact : a @entity51 lands at the @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity54 last november a part of the $ 396 billion @entity56 , the @entity1 's biggest and most expensive weapons program february 19 : all f - 35s grounded after crack found on low pressure turbine blade of @entity62 variant warplane january 16 : @entity64 ' @entity63 suspended for nearly one month after single engine failed during test flight in @entity67 january , 2012 : defense secretary @entity68 took @entity64 version of warplane off probation august , 2011 : flight and ground operations suspended after electrical problems on @entity62 aircraft march , 2011 : @entity76 grounded after dual generator failure on @entity62 test aircraft january , 2011 : then defense secretary @entity79 placed probation on warplane threatening to cancel fighter jet unless costs and problems were sorted within two years @entity85 , a spokesman for @entity35 , which supplies the engines for the planes , said the @entity1 's f - 35 program office had decided to rescind the grounding order after extensive tests and analysis of the cracked turbine blade , which was discovered on february 19 during a routine inspection conducted after every 50 hours of flight time			1
@entity85 said @entity35 engineers had been working around the clock with @entity1 experts to determine the cause of the crack in the engine blade , including a ' destructive ' test that cracked open the blade			1
the tests showed that the crack resulted from the ' unique operating environment ' in flight tests -- many of which tested the engine 's powerful after burners -- rather than a high - cycle fatigue crack , which would have required a design change			2
@entity85 said the engine in question had operated at high temperatures for more than four times longer than a typical f - 35 flight , which led to a separation of the ' grain boundary ' of this particular blade			0
the @entity120 order rescinding the flight ban , or so - called ' red stripe , ' said that engine had experienced the most ' hot engine time exposure ' of all the engines in the developmental program			0
it said it would now require reports to monitor and limit similar damage after every 25 flight hours			0
replacing : the @entity56 is intended to replace older fighters like the @entity62 @entity132 , pictured , and the @entity120 @entity133 while hoping to purchase more than 2,400 @entity35 recommended the resumption of flights and ground operations of the engine earlier on thursday after its engineers ruled out a high - cycle fatigue crack			1
the @entity1 said the investigation concluded that the 0.6 - inch long crack was caused by ' prolonged exposure to high levels of heat and other operational stressors			0
' @entity35 , a unit of @entity147 , supplies the engine for the single - engine , single - seat fighter plane , which is built by @entity36 watch the video here :			0

flight operations of @entity56 were grounded after a crack was found on an engine blade on a test plane in @entity9
flights were also suspended in january after an engine failure
the @entity4 program is the @entity1 's biggest and most expensive weapons program
@entity1 envisions purchasing more than 2,400 f - 35s
the @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , the @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 are *scheduled* to buy versions of the @entity56
