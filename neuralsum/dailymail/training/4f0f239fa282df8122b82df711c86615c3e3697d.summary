@entity0 has created an ' artificial brain ' from 16,000 computer processors , and sat it down with an internet connection			1
but , there 's a certain grim inevitability to the fact that the @entity9 company 's creation began watching stills from cat videos			1
the team , led by @entity0 's dr @entity13 , used the 16,000 processor array to create a brain - style ' neural network ' with more than a billion connections			1
there 's a certain grim inevitability to the fact that the @entity9 company 's creation began watching stills from cat videos recognising faces : @entity0 was able to pick out the characteristics of face and label images correctly the team then fed it random images culled from 10 million @entity9 videos - and let it ' learn ' by itself			1
unsurprisingly , the machine focused in on cats			0
' we never told it during the training , â€˜ this is a cat , '' said dr. @entity13			2
' it basically invented the concept of a cat			0
' ' contrary to what appears to be a widely - held intuition , our experimental results reveal that it is possible to train a face detector without having to label images as containing a face or not , ' says the team in a paper published this week			2
' we also find that the same network is sensitive to other high - level concepts such as cat faces and human bodies			1
starting with these learned features , we trained our network to obtain 15.8 % accuracy in recognizing 20,000 object categories from @entity57 , a leap of 70 % relative improvement over the previous state - of - the - art. the ' brain ' was a creation of the company 's ' blue sky ideas ' lab , @entity66 @entity0 leadership @entity67 , @entity69 and @entity70 in one of the company 's fleet of self - driving cars the lab is reportedly located in @entity0 's @entity76 , @entity78 headquarters - known as ' the @entity79 '			2
engineers are free to work on projects such as connected fridges that order groceries when they run low - or even tableware that can connect to social networks			0
other @entity0 engineers have reportedly researched ideas as far - out as elevators to space			0
@entity0 co-founder @entity69 is deeply involved in the lab. it 's known , for example , that his business card is simply a piece of silvery metal decorated with the letter @entity97 a typical @entity99 's cubicle			0
the company is known for attracting high - powered - but often eccentric - ' ideas people '			0

16,000 processors create brain - style ' neural network '
network learns by itself to *identify* cat faces
works with pool of 10 million images from @entity9
