@entity0 continued their 100 per cent record in the @entity2 as @entity4 's first - half double eased them to victory over @entity6			1
@entity4 struck after 13 minutes and again on the stroke of half - time as @entity10 's team moved to the brink of qualification for the knockout round			2
they had earlier beaten @entity15 4 - 1 and @entity16 5 - 0 to take command of @entity19 and tuesday 's win over the @entity20 further strengthened that position			1
@entity0 's @entity4 celebrates the first of his goals against @entity6 in the @entity2 @entity25 high - fives @entity24 after doubling @entity0 's advantage at their @entity28 training ground @entity0 : @entity29 , @entity30 ( @entity31 19 ) , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity24 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 ( @entity38 60 ) , @entity4 , @entity39 ( c ) ( @entity40 79 ) substitutes not used : @entity42 ( gk ) , @entity41 , @entity43 , @entity44 scorer : @entity25 13 , 45 @entity6 : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 ( c ) , @entity53 ( @entity54 90 ) , @entity55 ( @entity56 76 ) , @entity57 ( @entity58 81 ) , @entity59 substitutes not used : @entity60 ( gk ) , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 booked : @entity51 , @entity57 referee : @entity65 ( @entity66 ) @entity0 dominated from the off at their @entity28 training ground and took the lead when @entity4 exchanged passes with captain @entity39 before firing home with aplomb			1
@entity35 then had a chance to double the lead on @entity0 's next attack but scuffed his shot wide from six yards out			0
@entity31 , who had replaced the injured @entity77 early on , then forced @entity6 goalkeeper @entity46 into a save with @entity39 unable to get to the rebound			0
a free - kick from @entity35 and an effort from @entity37 forced @entity46 into evasive action as @entity0 pressed hard for a second goal			0
it duly arrived on the cusp of half - time and in stylish fashion			0
@entity39 back - heeled to @entity4 , who took a touch to set himself and then powered the ball home from outside the box			0
@entity4 could have claimed a hat - trick in the second - half but fired over on his left foot and then saw a venomous strike rattle the crossbar			1
if @entity0 claim three points in the return in @entity6 in a fortnight 's time they will assure themselves of a place in the last 16			2
@entity39 shields the ball from @entity6 's @entity51 during the contest at the @entity106 ' training ground @entity0 's @entity32 evades the slide challenge of @entity6 's @entity57 @entity31 sprints away from the @entity6 players as @entity0 press forward			2

@entity4 scored two first - half goals as @entity0 beat @entity6 2 - 0
the result at @entity28 continued their 100 per cent start to @entity2
@entity0 dominated from start to finish and *deserved* their win
