by @entity0 published : 06:28 est , 27 december 2012 updated : 09:49 est , 27 december 2012 from the moment he was diagnosed with testicular cancer , @entity1 had feared his dream of becoming a father would never come true			1
having battled testicular cancer twice – losing his left testicle and having nine rounds of chemotherapy in the process – he was told his chances of becoming a father were just five per cent			1
but this year , he ’s had more to celebrate than most			2
incredibly , just a week before he and his fiancé @entity13 , 32 , were due to start @entity14 , they discovered they had managed to conceive naturally and their son @entity16 was born in in april this year			1
@entity1 and his fiance @entity13 were given just a five per cent chance of conceiving naturally after he battled testicular cancer twice			1
their son @entity16 was born earlier this year ‘ it has been an amazing year , ’ @entity1 , 27 , told @entity21			1
‘ one of my biggest ambitions in life was to have a family , but i was always concerned it would never happen			0
’ @entity1 was just 18 when he was diagnosed with testicular cancer			1
after noticing a lump on his left testicle , he was referred to a specialist for an ultrasound test which confirmed the lump was cancerous and his testicle would need to be removed			2
he said : ‘ i have always wanted to be a dad but there was n’t much time to think about everything at the time – i was diagnosed on the friday and had surgery on the monday			0
afterwards , i went away , assuming that was it and tried to get on with my life			0
' sadly , that was n’t the case			0
just three months later , he received the devastating news the cancer was back – and , even worse , had spread to his stomach			0
' it was terrifying to be told it had come back and i was pretty scared , ' said @entity1			1
to battle the cancer , @entity1 needed nine gruelling rounds of intensive chemotherapy at @entity55			1
my first @entity56 : @entity16 opening his stocking ' the best present ever ' : @entity1 , with @entity16 , now nine months old and after being warned this could affect his fertility , he decided to have his sperm frozen at @entity61 as a preventive measure			1
the chemotherapy dragged on for months and sucked the life out of @entity65 as he had a terrible reaction to it , suffering severe nausea and vomiting and extreme fatigue			0
thankfully he responded well to the treatment and was put in remission in 2004			0
today , he only requires yearly check - ups			0
@entity16 celebrating his first @entity56 with mother @entity13 part of his treatment included taking the drug cisplatin , a drug developed in conjunction with @entity79 , which has transformed the outlook of men with advanced testicular cancer			1
when he met his fiance @entity13 at a friend 's birthday drinks four years ago , the couple , who live in @entity84 , @entity85 , quickly decided they wanted to start a family			1
but after nearly year of trying , they were worried something was wrong as @entity13 still was n’t pregnant			1
‘ i mentioned at one of my yearly cancer check - ups that we ’d been trying for a baby , with no luck , ’ recalls @entity1 , who now works for a telecoms company			2
and after tests on @entity1 ’s sperm , the couple were devastated to learn they had only a 5 per cent chance of conceiving naturally due to the quality			1
desperate to try and have a family of their own , they decided to have fertility treatment and , after a lengthy struggle , eventually managed to get it on the @entity111			0
amazingly , nine days before they were due to start @entity14 , @entity13 discovered she was six weeks pregnant			1
‘ i ’ll never forget that day - we were absolutely elated , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ i was obviously delighted that i was going to be a father but i was also happy for @entity13 that she did n’t have to go through some of the unpleasant procedures that @entity14 involves			1
we ’d been to a talk about it and it did n’t sound very nice			0
’ and on april 6th this year , @entity16 was born after a natural birth weighing 7lb 4oz			1
‘ he ’s a very healthy and happy baby , ’ says @entity1			2
‘ he ’s got @entity13 ’s mouth and nose and my hair at the moment ! ‘ the day he was born was one of the best days of my life – i ’d been so excited for the nine months before his arrival and could n’t believe he was finally here			2
' the day he was born was one of the best days of my life - i could n't believe he was finally here , ' says @entity1 ‘ i have always wanted to be a dad and we will definitely try and have another child			2
after the years of cancer treatment and trying for him , having him here this @entity56 was the best present ever			0
' according to @entity79 , a survey of men treated between 1982 and 1992 showed that 77 per cent were able to father a child and another five per cent 5 out of 100 did so after having fertility treatment			0
the biggest risk to fertility is chemotherapy , but even then about 70 per cent of men are able to father children			0
@entity144 , head of the @entity145 team said : ‘ it is great reading about @entity1 ’s story			2
it ’s not inevitable that testicular cancer patients will lose their fertility and even if they do it can come back			0
' it is also good to talk to the doctor about the possibility of sperm banking before treatment starts			0
we have information about all aspects of testicular cancer on our website			0
or if anyone has questions about any aspect of cancer and its treatment they can call @entity79 ’s nurses on 0808 800 4040			0
