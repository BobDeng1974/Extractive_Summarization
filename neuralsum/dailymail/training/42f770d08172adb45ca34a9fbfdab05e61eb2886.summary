by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:42 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 13:39 est , 20 march 2013 hard - pressed motorists received a scrap of good news today as chancellor @entity5 axed the fuel duty increase planned for the autumn			1
the rise would have put 3p on a litre of the already high price of petrol and diesel at the pumps and the @entity14 has now scrapped or frozen every scheduled fuel duty rise since 2010			1
the @entity16 says petrol is now 13p lower than it would have been under @entity18			0
that will mean an increase of between £ 5 and £ 15 for the standard tax - rate of all but the very cleanest cars			1
road tax rates for new car buyers will rise in the first year from between £ 5 and £ 35 to a maximum £ 1,065 for the biggest ‘ gas guzzlers			2
’ drivers will now have 14 days ‘ grace ’ after the time their car tax is paid before having to display their tax disc			0
currently the grace period is five days			0
the good news for classic car drivers is that cars manufactured before january 1 , 1974 will now be exempt from road tax – extending the current exemption by a year from 1973			0
declaring a car ‘ off - road ’ - and therefore not liable to tax - will in future be done on an ‘ indefinite ’ basis , rather than having to be renewed each year			2
this is ‘ to reduce tax administration costs			0
’ a planned reform of @entity57 to coincide with controversial road charging and tolls schemes has been deferred until after the general election			0
professor @entity61 , director of the @entity62 , said : ‘ what the chancellor gave drivers by scrapping the fuel duty rise he is allowing them to keep by not changing @entity57 bands			1
‘ by @entity69 the move was welcomed by the @entity72 mp for @entity73 , @entity71 – although some motorists ’ organisations said the move did not go far enough			0
mr @entity71 said : ‘ this was a cost of living budget			0
it puts fuel in the tank of the @entity83 economy			1
i 'm glad that the chancellor has listened again , and helped the millions of car - owners and businesses who are struggling to fill up their family car			2
‘ fuel duty is a toxic tax			1
it hits the poorest @entity90 the hardest			0
we have to keep petrol and diesel prices down			0
’ two thirds of the cost of petrol is made up of tax , either fuel duty or vat			1
tax accounts for more of the cost of petrol than in any other @entity103 country			0
figures from the @entity62 show that 800,000 @entity83 families now spend one quarter of their income on running a car			1
mr @entity5 announced last december that he would scrap a planned 3p hike in fuel duty set for january and postpone a rise set for next month			1
@entity112 , chief executive of the @entity113 , said the government should have gone further than merely cancelling planned future rises – he should have announced a cut in fuel duty			1
the @entity113 claims that every rise in fuel duty by 3p cuts 35,000 jobs and growth by 0.1 per cent			1
on the rise : the graph shows how prices had dropped in the final months of 2012 but have jumped again in january , february and march whitewash ? the @entity126 believes sharp rises in fuel prices are caused by increases in tax and not price - fixing by oil companies electric company cars will for the first time be taxed under benefit in kind rules			1
electric vehicles such as @entity138 ’s @entity137 are currently zero - rated for company car ‘ benefit in kind ’ rules			2
but from 2015 there will be a 5 per cent ‘ bik ’ rate , rising to 7 per cent the following year			0
it means a top - rate tax payer who currently pays zero tax on a @entity137 electric company car will pay £ 569 in 2015			2
and a 20 per cent basic rate tax payer will pay £ 284 a year or £ 24 per month in company car tax			0
and those who drive the electric plug - in hybrid @entity154 ( 49g/km @entity153 levels ) will see their benefit in kind rate more than double by 2016 - 17 – from 5 per cent to 11 per cent			2
@entity159 , tax partner at accountancy firm @entity161 said : ’ this is a bit of a kick in the teeth for people who went out in good faith to buy the greenest cars – including electric cars - but now see the chancellor tightening the screw			2
this trend is repeated across the various benefit in kind levels			0
’ but @entity138 , whose second generation electric @entity137 rolls off the line at their @entity177 factory next week , said ; ’ it could have been worse			0
at one stage the @entity16 were talking about a 15 per cent benefit in kind hike for electric cars			0
we ’d have preferred to continue with a zero rate , but at least this is not as bad as it might have been			0
’ the @entity16 said : ‘ the appropriate percentage of the list price subject to tax for the 0 - 50 g / km @entity153 band will be 5 per cent in 2015 - 16 , and 7 per cent in 2016 - 17			1
‘ the appropriate percentage of the list price subject to tax for the 51 - 75 g / km @entity153 band will be 9 per cent in 2015 - 16 and 11 per cent in 2016 - 17			1
’ by @entity69 ‘ @entity83 road transport operators are the people who actually keep the wheels of the economy moving , ’ he said			1
‘ to them , diesel fuel represents the life blood without which , they are unable to function			2
yet for many hauliers , high levels of fuel duty mean that diesel is fast becoming a luxury item			1
’ pressure group @entity204 criticised mr @entity5 ’s decision not to go for a fuel duty cut			1
‘ scrapping the planned autumn rise may be a welcome signal that the government is listening , but families will be devastated that fuel duty is n’t going to be cut , ’ said spokesman @entity207			1
‘ all the polls say that the country wants a reduction in their petrol and diesel bills , and actually lowering duty is the only way to offer that relief and boost @entity83 growth			1
’ mr @entity221 was tackled on the issue of fuel duty while visiting the @entity224 plant in @entity225 earlier this month			1
he said : ‘ i totally understand that many people have to run a car			0
it ’s not a choice , particularly if you live in rural areas			0
‘ i understand that people look at the price of petrol and diesel , they look at the cost of running even an inexpensive family car and it ’s still a very big amount they are paying			2
' so we ’ve got to do everything we can to help people get on , help people get to work , help people live their lives			0
’ mr @entity5 's announcement , which had been widely expected , was welcomed by some motoring groups			1
@entity246 president @entity245 said : ' a september fuel duty hike would have been the last straw likely to break @entity83 drivers ' budgets and would have led to a summer of discontent			1
' the scrapping is a pragmatic move and will bring some relief at the pumps			0
already 76 per cent of @entity246 members are cutting back on journeys , household expenditure or both , due to the high cost of fuel			2
' professor @entity61 , director of the @entity62 , said : ' this news provides breathing space for families being smothered by the soaring costs of motoring , especially the 800,000 households spending more than a quarter of their income on operating a vehicle			2
' rising costs : the average 5p a litre increase in february added £ 2.50 to the cost of a typical 50 - litre refill this month			0
