former 100metres world record - holder @entity0 returned to the track in @entity3 , @entity4 on tuesday after his 18 - month ban for taking a banned stimulant was reduced to six months on appeal			1
the @entity8 claimed he felt ' like a virgin ' before his year away from the sport ended with him finishing third in 10.30secs			1
sadly , however , the purity and thrill of watching a man run as fast as is humanly possible disappeared a long time ago			2
the @entity16 start in @entity17 a week on wednesday and , although @entity0 's time will not force @entity8 selectors into making a difficult decision , the 31 - year - old could still feasibly have been picked to represent his country once again			1
his inclusion , however , would have been a further slight on those who have paid up to £ 90 to sit inside @entity42 and trust what they are seeing is the result of real human endeavour and natural talent			0
increasingly , it is only the clever work of highly - paid lawyers , hired to take their client 's cases to the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) and get them back on track as soon as possible			1
already this year , @entity8 400m runner @entity55 has successfully appealed for her six - year ban for taking a banned stimulant to be cut by 18 months			1
three - time @entity60 champion @entity59 , who will compete in @entity17 , also saw a two - year suspension dismissed as @entity53 berated the ' deplorable ' mistakes in collecting her positive sample			0
@entity0 and fellow @entity8 sprinter @entity23 employed @entity65 attorney @entity64 to fight their 18 - month bans , arguing three months was more appropriate for their ' minor ' offences because the banned substance , oxilofrine , had been found in a contaminated food supplement , @entity73			1
their appeal was partially upheld and the @entity76 ( @entity77 ) has been forced to pay ' historic costs ' in lawyer and appeal costs , believed to be ' one of the biggest rewards in the history of @entity53			0
' @entity85 's highest authority will reveal the full reasons for its findings in due course			0
reduced : @entity23 is also able to compete again pondering : @entity0 gets ready to compete in @entity3 on tuesday night in @entity94 , meanwhile , an amateur surfboat rower , @entity90 , who paid £ 20 for an over-the - counter supplement at a health food store , is saddled with a two - year ban for testing positive for the same stimulant , oxilofrine			1
an @entity99 ( @entity99 ) midfielder , @entity98 , is serving an 18 - month suspension for a banned stimulant he inadvertently took in a sports drink on match day			1
@entity104 operates a ' no excuses ' policy and has forced all home nation athletes competing at the @entity16 , as well as more than 200 coaches , to complete a mandatory education programme			0
its goal is to avoid a single positive test during @entity17 2014 , but there is no uniformity across the globe or in different sports , and it is ultimately the clean athletes and the fans expected to fill stadiums who suffer			0
the @entity124 , athletics ' world governing body , is committed ' to doing everything in its power to eradicate cheating ' and will return to four - year bans for ' serious doping offences ' from january 2015			1
the list of athletes currently serving drugs bans stretches to 26 pages and the @entity124 has been testing blood , as well as urine , since 2001			0
when athletes are banned for taking drugs , the default position is still to desperately cling on to the positives and talk about the strong message of zero tolerance those suspensions send out			2
but the messages at the moment are so mixed it 's difficult to take any positives at all			0
letting them back in too easy ? @entity146 is another who has been banned over drugs in the past yes , we 're catching them , but then we 're letting them back into the sport			1
relatively little is still known about the long - term effects of doping on performance , while the short - term impact in terms of trust and reputation is acutely damaging			0
sprinting , in particular , has become a merry - go - round of former drug cheats			1
half of the men who featured in the 100m final at the @entity164 are now tainted and 40 sub- 10 - second performances have had to be scratched from the archives			1
and yet organisers of the @entity3 meeting still clamoured to sign @entity0 and blow most of their modest £ 500,000 budget on staging his comeback			1
they then trumpeted his return at a press conference on monday , during which he was sitting next to @entity175 : @entity177 's @entity60 shot put champion who was denied her moment on top of the podium in @entity183 by a drugs cheat			2
angry : shot - putter @entity175 of @entity175 said @entity60 champion @entity186 ' tainted the sport ' angry : shot - putter @entity175 of @entity175 said @entity60 champion @entity186 ' tainted the sport ' @entity186 of @entity188 cried her ' crocodile tears ' while a gold medal was placed around her neck , only to then twice test positive for methenolone , an anabolic steroid			2
she claimed her coach had intentionally spiked her coffee , but was given a four - year ban and stripped of the @entity60 title			0
' i was pissed off , ' said @entity198 last year			0
' i was really angry at her			0
i think one thing is that i will never forgive her			0
she has tainted the sport			2
' @entity186 did , and so too do the hundreds of others who cheat , serve their time and then return to track and field crying their crocodile tears			2
we need to believe what we are seeing is real .			0

@entity0 finishes third on return to action , clocking 10.30secs in @entity3 to finish third
but are we letting drug cheats back into the sport too easily ?
half of the runners in the 2012 olympics 100m final have been banned at some point
