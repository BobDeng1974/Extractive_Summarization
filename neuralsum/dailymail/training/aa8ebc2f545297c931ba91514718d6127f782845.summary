entrepreneur : talk show host @entity0 ( left ) is launching her own lifestyle brand , @entity24 ( right ) - after the pet - name her wife @entity13 has for her - which will debut in early november ' my goal is that people can have a beautiful house , a really comfortable house , without only being able to afford [ very expensive ] things , ' she explains			1

@entity0 's venture is bolstered by retail mogul @entity55 – ex-husband of @entity57 , and the man responsible for helping launch her fashion empire			2
he describes her as the dream business partner , saying : ' everyone responds to her - you 're a man , you 're a woman , you 're a mom , you 're a working mom - she brings a happiness and a light and a true authenticity			0
' animal lovers : @entity0 ( pictured last month with wife @entity13 ) is a vocal advocate of the couple 's health - conscious , vegan lifestyle , and @entity24 will release its range of cat and dog accessories next @entity79 @entity0 has thrown her weight behind several brands in the past , from @entity82 to @entity83 and @entity84 , and the self - confessed ' big animal lover ' has a particular loyalty to the support of animal - rights organizations , such as @entity89			2
in 2011 , she launched going vegan with @entity0 , a site dedicated to her animal - friendly diet and lifestyle			1
she had an all - vegan wedding with @entity13 in 2008 , and more recently , had plans to open a vegan tapas bar in @entity96 , which ultimately fell through			0

mr @entity108 reportedly ' went nuts over the famous house and @entity0 's interior design , ' so if this glowing report is anything to go by , @entity24 's imminent launch could well be a storming success .			2
