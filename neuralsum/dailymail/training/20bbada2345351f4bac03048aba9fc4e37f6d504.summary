by @entity0 published : 11:20 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 12:28 est , 7 november 2013 at three weeks old , this baby @entity2 elephant loves spending the day scampering around his enclosure in a bid to find his feet			2
but it seems the calf is still trying to get to grips with his tiny legs after he fell trunk - first into the mud when his feet got tangled up			1
luckily , his doting mother was there in seconds to rescue her clumsy new - born and propped him back up on all fours before he ran off again			1
elephant calves are born with a lot of coarse hair on their heads and back , which they lose as they get older			2
it 's not conclusively known why this head and back hair exists , although hair around the eyes and ears is usually for protection from elements and ' invading particles '			0
it could also provide an extra sense of touch to newborns , who rely heavily on their mother 's presence for many years			1
it may just be a hangover of time in the womb			0
elephant foetuses are covered in a felt of downy hair called ' lanugo '			0
most of this is shed before birth			0
the longest hair on an adult elephant can be found in it 's tail , which can grow to more than three feet long			1
the trunks is also covered in small sensory hairs that help in the animals ' feel ' and identify objects			0
@entity25 was born on october 12 to second - time mum @entity85 at @entity86 in @entity27 , @entity87			1
he has spent the first few weeks of his life playing with the herd and rushing around the seven - acre paddock			2
zookeepers say the 22 - stone elephant has been a ' handful ' ever since he was welcomed into the world and sometimes needs a helping hand when he is on the move			1
he was pictured having the ungainly moment at the zoo when his legs gave way while he was running around a tree trunk			1
zookeeper @entity102 , who is watching @entity25 's development , said : ' he has come on so much in just three weeks and is already showing an independent streak			1
' he ’ll happily leave his mum ’s side to go and play in the paddock with the rest of the herd			0
' @entity85 is proving to be an excellent mum and the other elephants are just so excited to be around @entity112 ' elephants are very social animals and having youngsters joining the herd is what elephant life is all about			2
' @entity25 shares @entity120 ’s seven acre paddock with nine other elephants – including brother @entity122 , aged three , and half siblings @entity124 , four , and @entity125 , two			2
back up : @entity25 's mother @entity85 comes to his rescue within seconds and helps him back to his feet supportive : his doting mother has been keeping a close eye on him ever since he was born settling in : @entity25 may have only been at the zoo for less than a month , but zookeepers say he is already loved by the herd and is very excitable mr @entity136 added : ' the herd love him , when he was first born they all wanted to see him and be with him			1
' his younger brother @entity125 was nervous at first and stayed away with him but is now bullying him , which is a good sign			0
' he runs around all the time , he is just full of energy at the moment			0
eager : the speedy nipper was moving around on his feet within minutes of being born and is already amusing zookeepers as he gets to grips with his tiny trunk by his side : sometimes his mother needs to protect him a little bit more siblings : his half brother @entity125 , two , was uneasy with @entity25 at the start , but is now bullying him which , according to zookeepers , is a good sign @entity157 : staff at the zoo say the new - born is a ' handful ' and does not seem to stop ' he does n't seem to stop at all so he is definitely a handful			1
the new arrival is an important addition to the @entity164 for @entity2 elephants because there are thought to be only around 35,000 left in the wild			0
their numbers have declined by at least 50 per cent over the last three generations due to habitat loss , degradation and fragmentation .			0

@entity25 was playing at @entity26 in @entity27 when he fell
was running around a tree trunk when his legs gave way and slipped over
his mother , @entity85 , was there by her offspring 's side to help him up
new - born is three feet tall , *weighs* 22 stone and is still trying to balance
