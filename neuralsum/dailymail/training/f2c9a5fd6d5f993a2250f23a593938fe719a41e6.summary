the tail end of an @entity2 tropical storm called @entity3 is heading towards the @entity4 and could hit @entity4 with heavy rain and winds at the start of next week			1
@entity3 was today close to the @entity8 and is predicted to develop into a hurricane later this evening			1
forecasters believe the storm will head north staying offshore from the east coast of the @entity13 before swinging out and across the @entity2			1
today @entity3 was close to the @entity8 and is predicted to develop into a hurricane later this evening at the moment the storm looks like it will head in the direction of the @entity4 and continental @entity18			1
if the storm continues the way it is going , it likely @entity4 will experience a summer storm from the start of next week including heavy rain and strong winds			1
' one certainty is that as the storm heads north away from the very warm seas which drive its power , it will lose strength and become what 's known as an extra-tropical storm – so we wo n't be seeing a ' hurricane in @entity18 ' , but there is a chance we could see a fairly active summer storm			1
' the development of extra tropical storms can present complexities for meteorologists , and @entity3 is a good example of that			1
families enjoy the warm weather at @entity44 , in @entity45 , @entity46 today ' in the case of @entity3 each of the models we use gives a very different picture of what the storm will do			1
' this ranges from @entity3 heading towards @entity55 as a weak feature which will completely miss the @entity4 , to it arriving as a fairly active summer storm			1
' in terms of timing , there 's also a spread of possibilities – but it looks likely that the earliest @entity3 would affect the @entity4 would be on sunday or into the start of next week			1
' according to the @entity67 , today and tomorrow will be sunny but heavy rain will hit the @entity4 on wednesday the @entity67 will be keeping an eye on the storm and will be offering advice on what @entity3 is likely to do over the coming days			1
@entity73 , a spokesman at the @entity67 , said that the storms would not be on the same scale experienced across the @entity4 last october when @entity4 was battered by @entity77 's storm with winds of up to 90mph			1
meanwhile , today and tomorrow is set to remain sunny with temperatures in their mid- 20s			2
prince @entity80 attended a first world war memorial service where balloons with poppies were let into the sky according to the @entity67 most parts of the @entity4 will enjoy some good sunny spells today but scattered showers are likely to develop in the afternoon , perhaps heavy and thundery in places , especially over @entity46			1
it will be feeling warm in the sunshine with a maximum temperature of about 24c			2
tomorrow will also be sunny at first but cloud tending to increase by the afternoon			2
it will be dry for most of the day but a few showers are likely later with a maximum temperature of @entity96			2
however , most parts of the @entity4 will experience showers on wednesday with heavy rain in the south of @entity101			1
the band of rain should pass quickly with sunshine appearing again on thursday			2
experts say this pattern was probably caused by ice crystals forming round an aeroplane experts at the @entity67 have said this is a holepunch or fallstreak cloud			2
it forms when part of the cloud layer forms ice crystals which are large enough to fall			0
aircraft punching through this cloud layer can cause air to expand and cool as it passes over the aircraft wings or propeller			0
this change in temperature can be enough to make the supercooled droplets to freeze and fall from the cloud layer in this distinctive pattern			0
