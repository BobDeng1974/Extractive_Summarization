farmer @entity0 is used to counting sheep at this time of year but she had to double check the one - in - a - million arrival of these five lambs			1
the incredibly rare quintuplets have shocked the world of agriculture after being born to a hardy ewe at a farm in @entity9			1
ms @entity0 , 55 , has had the mother sheep , called mrs @entity11 , for three years and every lambing season so far she has given birth to twin lambs			1
little miracles : @entity9 farmer @entity0 , 55 , was amazed when her prize ewe ' mrs @entity11 ' delivered a quintuplet of tiny lambs this week shock : ms @entity0 was expecting her prized ewe to produce triplets so was stunned when five babies arrived this year , a scan had shown that the @entity25 ewe was due to have triplets so after three new - borns arrived @entity0 left mrs @entity11 to it and went off for a cup of coffee			1
@entity0 said : ' i checked on the mum at 10.15pm and saw she was having two small lambs			1
' i knew she was having triplets so i waited for number three to arrive and when it did i went off for a cup of coffee			2
' there was a bit of a noise in the shed and when i returned 20 minutes later there were five little lambs who were all alive and healthy and they are absolutely adorable			2
' the lambs all weigh just over three pounds each but @entity0 is having to bottle feed three of them with formula milk every four hours as mrs @entity11 only has two teats			1
@entity0 , who has worked on the family - run @entity50 near @entity52 , @entity9 , all her life , said : ' they 're all doing very well			1
' we have her mum in one pen and the lambs are in a little pen next to her , so they can keep in contact			2
' i have never seen anything like it before			2
i 've had times when four lambs have been born but never five , it is incredibly rare			0
' the fact they are all alive and pretty even sized is amazing			0
' we have n't quite got round to naming them yet but were thinking of taking some of the names from @entity70			0
' stats amazing : there is just a one - in - a - million chance of a ewe producing quintuplets @entity0 is expecting 178 ewes on her farm to give birth to about 340 lambs , most of which will end up as roast dinners in the future			1
@entity84 , a spokesman for the @entity85 , said : ' quintuplets are very rare and i bet it came as a real surprise especially as it was not picked up on the scans ahead of lambing			0
' we hear of a lot about twins and triplets that are born on farms , but surviving quintuplets are something very special and unusual			0
' this sort of thing may be a once in a generation experience			0
' at the moment it 's a busy time for sheep farmers			0
helping to rear the quintuplets will help to ease the pressure on the mum			0
