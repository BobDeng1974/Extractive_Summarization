by @entity0 the star wattage of the celebrity front row threatened to outshine the blinging gowns at saturday night 's @entity5 's show			1
ladylike supermodel @entity6 perched next to a not so prim @entity7 , whose sheer dress was strictly nsfw , while @entity9 shared selfies with @entity11 , actress @entity12 and singer @entity13			1
the @entity20 cast were there en masse , too , to support their designer dancing partner - in - crime , as well as @entity5 's family , all the way from the valleys making the most of the pre-show cocktail reception as they celebrated his da 's 80th birthday			1
and what a way to celebrate , as his son @entity5 treated the audience to a dazzling collection of glamorous @entity33 fashion inside the imposing @entity34 heavy metals opened the @entity5 show a silver two - piece featured a sheer train heavy beading created optical illusions the heavy bass on the stereo as the show opened was a prelude to the heavy metal all over the catwalk			1
a dramatic display of evening dresses began with a collection of gold , silver and pewter gowns featuring knitted , beaded , blinging mosaics and a lot of mesh , ergo flesh			2
to follow there were more disco - ready dresses ( the @entity5 woman does n’t wear trousers ) – inspired by fabulous architecture and stained windows according to the designer – in ruby red , shimmering emerald green and electric blue			2
celebrity stylist @entity68 said at the show : ' @entity5 never disappoints , with his use of glimmer and sparkle alongside carefully placed transparent fabrics making for a spectacular show			2
' my favourite piece was the petrol blue dress which i 'm sure we 'll see sauntering down a red carpet or two in coming weeks			0
' the lbd was given a sexy makeover for @entity83 @entity85 snakeskin was a theme glamorous shoe brand @entity87 provided sky - high heels this peacock - inspired gown was a hit the crowd - pleasing dress was seriously daring oriental detail showed skill an electric blue knitted dress was daring but demure a ruby red mini dress added a jolt of colour a knitted dress shimmered on the runway flirty feathers , crochet detail and even a bit of suede made it into the show here and there but it was the floor - sweepers that had the crowd hooked with delicate peacock and oriental embellishment showing off @entity5 's mastery of detail			1
before the show @entity5 addressed the willowy models , whose hair was slicked back with gel and faces were covered in shine : ' i picked you because you 're beautiful on the inside and on the outside			0
be strong , be empowered and have a f * * * ing amazing time ! ' celebrity stylist @entity68 said : ' @entity5 never fails to impress with glimmer and careful use of fabrics			0
' the dramatic finale received a standing ovation from many of the celebrities sitting on the front row , and designer @entity5 was delighted with the response the celebrity front row threatened to outshine the dresses ( l - r ) @entity13 , @entity12 , @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity141 show - stopping gowns like @entity5 's need serious hair and make - up to complement them			1
step up glam squad @entity146 and @entity148 who gave saturday 's models a fierce disco makeover before they hit the catwalk			0
@entity146 is an industry heavyweight , having worked on models such as @entity154 and @entity155 and creating countless @entity156 covers			0
working with @entity158 for @entity5 's show she did n't hold back , giving the girls dramatic eyes and glistening lips , cheeks and skin			1
' it 's all about the eye , ' declared @entity146 backstage , just before she bawled at one of her interns for snapping @entity170 shots rather than powdering a model , ' i am using everything you should n't use : 8 hour cream , lip gloss , oil ... but these looks only need to last a few minutes on the catwalk			0
' mood boards for the artists to work from were posted around the hair and make - up stations backstage at the @entity34 while designer @entity5 's inspiration was architecture and stained glass windows @entity146 's muse was a bit more straightforward fashion : nineties model @entity191 as she appeared on @entity192 in 1999			1
@entity146 said : ' the idea is to create the impression of a bleached eyebrow with a dramatic eye			0
my inspiration was @entity5 's girl @entity191 and a bit of the new romantics			1
it 's high octane , think glorious , glamorous , very @entity5			2
' one of @entity146 's team of make - up artists was dispatched with a can of glistening body spray to attack the models arms and legs : ' what 's in it ? @entity212 only knows , it 's a trade secret , ' she said as she added a golden glow to the troupe of teenage skin			0
hair , overseen by the handsome @entity148 was hi - shine but low maintenance slicked back into a glossy and futuristic tangle within minutes of the models arriving from their last show			0
as he piled on the mousee , hairspray and gel ( applied with a paintbrudh of course ) @entity148 said : ' the place is so massive and big , it can really take a look			0
@entity5 's gowns are so beautiful , we needed something a little bit tough to break it up a bit - as soon as you add an up - do it can go ' lady ' really fast			2
