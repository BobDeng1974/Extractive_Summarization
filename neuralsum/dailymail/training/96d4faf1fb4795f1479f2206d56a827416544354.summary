by @entity0 @entity1 was just eight years old when she started to develop agonising headaches			1
each time she suffered six or so hours of intense pain and would often be sick			2
' the first time it happened was horrendous , ' says @entity1 's mother , @entity6			1
' it was terrible seeing her suffer			1
' she took her to the doctor , who said she had a stomach bug - but the problem kept returning , at first every six weeks but eventually once or twice a week			1
yet during three more visits to the doctor over 18 months , @entity14 was told it was another stomach bug or a virus			2
ten year old @entity20 from @entity21 , @entity19 suffered from migraines for more than two years ' the doctors just kept saying it must be a bug when we knew it was n't , ' says @entity14 , 47 , a full - time mother			1
it took the arrival of a new gp to notice that @entity1 , now ten , was suffering from migraines			1
her mother admits : ' i never thought about a child having a migraine			0
' many people believe migraines to be mainly an adult condition , but @entity1 is one of the 10 per cent of children who suffer from them			1
in fact , migraine can even strike young babies			0
the charity @entity43 says it has had reports of infants of four months with symptoms of sudden , short - lived paralysis of eye muscles , face or one of the limbs - warning signs of the onset of a migraine attack			1
for many migraine sufferers , the main feature is a thumping headache			0
some experience an aura beforehand , during which they have visual disturbances , aches in the neck and shoulders , sensitivity to light , sound and smells , and a drop in energy			0
others have no headache but suffer the other symptoms			1
most children with migraine will have a headache			1
around 90 per cent will also feel sick and about 60 per cent will actually be sick			0
others may complain of stomach ache			0
only 20â € ‰ â € ‰ per cent have auras			0
but as children often complain of the occasional headache and can be prone to tummy aches , the symptoms can be mistaken for something else , such as an allergy or sinus problems			1
a consultant has helped her and she takes magnesium pills to ease symptoms migraine charities say they often hear of children who have suffered for months or even years before getting a correct diagnosis			1
the vomiting associated with migraines is even mistaken for appendicitis , says dr @entity96 , director of headache services at @entity98 , @entity99			1
' the symptoms may also be mistaken for attempts to avoid school			0
in children the attacks are often about four hours long , so by the time they are picked up from school by their parents they may be better , and accused of malingering			1
' children 's attacks tend to be shorter - hours compared with up to three days for an adult			1
what causes migraines is not clear			2
one theory is that low levels of the brain chemical serotonin cause blood vessels in the brain to contract suddenly and then expand			0
sickness is caused by chemical changes during an attack stimulating the area of the brain that controls vomiting.the condition also runs in families , so it may be genetic			0
attacks can be brought on by all sorts of triggers - some people are sensitive to caffeine , others to too much or too little sleep			2
stress can also make migraine worse , for example , during exam @entity136 migraine expert dr @entity134 says his patients at the @entity142 in @entity143 can miss up to 80 days of school a year			0
' in every class at least two or three children will suffer with migraine , ' he says			1
' some may only have it two or three times a year , but others will have it more frequently and it causes a lot of problems with their education and social activities			0
' most children with migraine are between the ages of five and 15			2
the impact on them and their families can be huge			0
' yet there are fewer preventative treatments for children than for adults , as many drugs have not been approved for under - 18s			1
two drugs tend to be used : pizotifen , to prevent swelling in blood vessels in the brain ; and propranolol , which acts in a similar way			0
paracetamol and ibuprofen can help when an attack has started			2
dr @entity134 advises reducing children 's intake of caffeine from drinks such as cola and not skipping meals , as low blood sugar can cause attacks			2
he also recommends time outside for an hour a day , away from screens			0
@entity187 is a common trigger , especially the blue light from @entity189 , computer screens , mobile phones and @entity192			0
' once someone has migraine they always have it , but as they get older the migraine goes into good and bad phases , and the good phases without headaches can last for years , ' says dr @entity134			0
' often a person 's threshold for what triggers a migraine increases , so what caused one when they were younger no longer does			0
' @entity1 's migraines are now better controlled			1
she was referred to a paediatric neurologist in june 2012 and tried several medications including pizotifen , a nasal spray called @entity211 , and paracetamol			1
but none had much effect			0
pictured wither mother @entity6 , @entity1 would be very tired and irritable when getting a migraine ' when a migraine was coming on , @entity1 would be very tired and irritable and we often had to cancel plans , ' says @entity14 , who lives with her partner @entity220 , 47 , a school caretaker , and their other daughters @entity224 , 16 , and @entity0 , 14 , in @entity21 , @entity225			1
' she 'd often come home from school early with a migraine			2
' however , her migraine has improved thanks to a less orthodox approach - magnesium pills			1
migraine sufferers are thought to have lower levels of magnesium in the brain during an attack			2
one study of 81 adults found that taking 600mg of magnesium daily for 12 weeks reduced the number of migraine attacks by 42 per cent			2
dr @entity134 says it helps some children with migraine and he often recommends it when other treatments have proved ineffective			2
' it can be bought over the counter and is safe in the recommended doses , ' he says			0
@entity1 has not had a full - blown migraine since november , a month after she started on magnesium			1
' the pain felt like tiny men trying to thump out of my head , ' she says			0
' i felt very tired and had to miss things my friends and sisters were doing			0
now i just have a bit of a sore head , which i can cope with			0
