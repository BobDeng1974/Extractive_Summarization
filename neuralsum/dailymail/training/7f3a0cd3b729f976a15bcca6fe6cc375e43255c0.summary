eight years ago our marriage went through a rough patch and i had a brief affair and confided in her			1
she did n’t tell my husband , but she ’s taken to dropping hints ( ' our secret ' sort of thing ) in front of him and i ’m beginning to feel emotionally blackmailed			1
worse , she ’s now divorced and keeps flirting with my spouse , whom she ’s always fancied			0
what do i do ? will she tell ? she had an affair and told her husband 's best female friend but now feels emotionally blackmailed answer : well , you ’ve learnt a lesson the hard way : when you choose a confidante for tales of marital infidelity , pick someone who owes more loyalty to you than your spouse			1
yes , she was your friend , too , but only after she ’d known your husband for years			1
those early alliances are formative and go deeper than you think			0
i have watched people separate after decades together , believing they will stay in touch with all their spouse ’s good friends			0
it ’s sadly true that some women are possessive of their male friends and are never totally reconciled to their choice of wife			0
clearly this woman falls into that category			0
it ’s possible she always envied you and your marriage , and was waiting for you to make a mistake			2
if her own marriage has proved unhappy and ended badly , she ’s likely to feel you do n’t deserve your ‘ unsuspecting ’ husband			1
whatever the truth of her motivation , she is reminding you in the starkest way that she has a strong hold over you			0
if you want to erase the power of this woman , confess the affair to your husband			2
then tell him you deeply regret what happened and love him more than anyone on the planet			2
i admit , however , it ’s a high - risk strategy , especially if your husband is a jealous , insecure or volatile type			2
having said that , my observation is that good marriages , with solid foundations , are usually able to withstand one foolish indiscretion — particularly if the person who strayed is truly remorseful			0
alternatively , you could just crouch down and prepare to ride this one out			0
tackling this female ' friend ' is only likely to make her feel more resentful and hostile , in which case it ’s worth sitting her down and saying to her that you made a huge mistake , you regret it every day of your life , but you ’d like to draw a line under things .			1

my husband 's best female friend became a close pal of mine too
i confided in her but regret it as i now feel emotionally blackmailed
@entity0 : it 's possible that she 's always envied you and your marriage
