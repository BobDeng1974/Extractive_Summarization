@entity1 @entity0 , pictured , will blast off for space on september 1 aboard the @entity4 rocket to the @entity5 just before 11am on september 1 , a mighty @entity7 rocket will blast off from the @entity8 deep in the desert steppes of @entity10			1
on board will be a space capsule containing three highly - trained cosmonauts bound for the @entity5 ( @entity5 )			1
the crew will be commanded by colonel @entity15 , a 42 - year - old @entity16 who will be leading his third mission into space			2
assisting him will be 35 - year - old @entity20 flight engineer @entity20 , the holder of a doctorate in engineering from the @entity24			0
the third crew member will be a 55 - year - old @entity26 soprano called @entity0			1
@entity0 ? the big ‑ haired @entity28 star who was once married to @entity30 ? yes , that very same @entity0 will be boldly going where no multi-millionaire singer has been before			1
@entity0 , who ironically once fronted @entity33 for their 1978 smash hit @entity35 , is becoming a cosmonaut			1
it seems like a joke			0
but the star , who has sold more than 30 million albums , is deadly serious			0
recently , she was shivering in sub-zero temperatures in a forest outside @entity43 during survival training with her fellow cosmonauts			2
this week , @entity0 announced that she ’ll hold a press conference on march 10 to discuss the mission			1
it turns out the singer has always hankered after being the @entity0 on the moon			1
‘ i think i was eight at the time			0
i remember watching the first man on the moon on tv , and something flipped , ’ she said in an interview			0
‘ i ’d been quiet and reticent as a child , and suddenly my mind opened and i thought : “ i want to do something very , very special			0
i want to go there , where they are ; i want to go up into space			2
” that moment , things changed for me			0
’ ms @entity0 , right , was previously married to renowned composer @entity30 , left the singer ’s fascination with space travel may seem surprising — in fact , a cynic might suggest that the whole thing is just a publicity stunt			1
but if that ’s the case , then it ’s a stunt that is financially truly astronomical			0
the most reliable estimate suggests that @entity0 ’s ten - day sojourn on the @entity5 will cost her £ 34 million			1
@entity0 may be rich — but not that rich , surely ? space tourists tend to be billionaires , not mere multi-millionaires			1
ms @entity0 , pictured , fronted @entity33 's 1978 smash hit @entity35 besides the question of who is funding the trip , what sort of training does a middle - aged woman have to do to be taken around the world 16 times a day ? after all , in order to fly into space , you need to be a lot fitter than your average @entity92 passenger			1
that ’s why , back in july 2012 , @entity0 travelled from her home near @entity95 to @entity96 , where @entity97 subjected the singer to the most rigorous medical checks to see whether she could make it as a cosmonaut			1
‘ the doctor , who has worked with a lot of astronauts , was saying : “ i do n’t believe this : even on the brain scans you ’re coming out perfect , ” ’ @entity0 said			1
the singer ’s next port - of - call was the @entity110 in @entity110 , near @entity43 , where she was evaluated on a whole range of simulators			0
perhaps the most gruelling was the centrifuge — a giant arm - like structure that whisks its poor occupants around at something approaching 200mph , simulating the massive g ‑ forces that astronauts are subjected to when they sit on top of a rocket hurtling into space			1
apparently , @entity0 remained calm , with her pulse barely increasing			1
other tests included being strapped to rotating chairs , and a psychological evaluation			0
‘ it was full - on , ’ she said			0
‘ it was far more than i could ’ve expected			0
‘ but i ’d already sort of been trained for it by all my years of touring , in terms of the uncomfortableness , not knowing what to expect , having to create something out of nothing			0
’ @entity0 may well have been prepared by the man she has most recently been romantically linked to , a flaxen - haired @entity139 inventor and aeronautics engineer called @entity141			1
according to @entity141 ’s website , he worked at @entity143 , one of the first companies that attempted to commercialise private manned space travel , and is currently developing a flying motorbike			0
with or without his help , @entity0 passed through @entity110 with flying colours			2
over the next six months , she can expect training to get even tougher			0
it will include working in space suits underwater , experiencing weightlessness in specially adapted aircraft , working on her physical and mental fitness , learning some @entity16 and getting to know her way around a mock - up of the @entity5 the regime would be gruelling even for someone half her age			1
however , we must return to that thorny question of who is paying for all this			0
one clue could be found at the press conference in @entity43 in october 2012 when @entity0 announced her stellar ambitions			2
ms @entity0 will board the @entity4 rocket as it blasts off into space to join the @entity5 sitting alongside her was a man called @entity171 , who is the director of the sector for external relations and public information of @entity175 ( the @entity175 )			1
as it happens , @entity0 is a @entity177 ’ , which means she is an international advocate for its work			2
@entity180 and @entity0 gushed about how the trip into space would ‘ reach out to be a force for good ’ , promote ‘ sustainability ’ and encourage more women to enter the fields of science and technology			1
brazenly referencing @entity189 , the album she would release in 2013 , @entity0 gushed : ‘ we want to engage a generation of dream chasers from all walks of life to help us create a more sustainable future			2
’ such sentiments are very worthy but they ’re rather woolly			0
it is unclear how @entity0 ’s chasing of her own dream will , in reality , improve the planet and the advancement of women			2
ms @entity0 , pictured , is a @entity175 ' @entity177 ' although they are not paying for her trip however , according to a spokesman , @entity175 is not forking out a bean for @entity0 ’s mission			1
nevertheless , its backing naturally makes the singer ’s reach for the stars look more humanitarian than purely egotistical			0
if @entity175 is providing credibility , then another body is backing the aspirant astronaut in rather more practical ways			0
in @entity217 in july 2013 , @entity0 signed a deal with the @entity219			2
@entity220 is a vast @entity222 collective firm that — among other activities — develops property , distributes the soft drink @entity226 , owns resorts , runs health centres , has its own aviation firm and has even recently bought @entity230 for £ 135 million			0
also in its portfolio in the @entity233 is 10 @entity234 in the @entity235 — now a luxury hotel , club and apartment block			0
at the ceremony , @entity0 agreed — for an undisclosed fee — to be the ‘ image ambassador ’ for @entity234 , and would ‘ attend cultural exchanges organised by @entity243 ’ every year for the next four years			2
she also agreed to perform a concert during her time in the space station that would be streamed live back to @entity247 ‘ during an event organised by @entity243 ’			0
it is undoubtedly a great coup for the @entity219			0
@entity0 is a huge star in @entity251 , and her perceived sophistication is a big draw for the type of clientele that @entity220 wants to woo			2
a concert from space given by @entity0 will be a fantastic publicity stunt for @entity220 , and would help to cement its global brand			1
@entity260 is worth many billions , so it is conceivable that @entity220 can bankroll most , if not all , of @entity0 ’s space trip			1
@entity0 might have secured what may be the ultimate freebie			2
she may once have lost her heart to a starship trooper , but in order to get her to the heavens , it ’s now been won by an @entity251 conglomerate			0
ultimately , to get into space , it ’s not dreams that @entity0 has had to chase , but the reality of cold , hard @entity222 cash .			1

@entity0 will board the @entity4 space rocket on september 1
she will be blasted into space along with two other cosmonauts
she will spend ten days on the @entity5 before returning
it is estimated her *extra-terrestrial* trip will cost more than £ *34million*
