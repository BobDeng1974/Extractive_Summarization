by @entity0 discovery : a common treatment for heavy snorers also has a powerful effect on their performance on the golf course , scientists have found forget hours of practice and spending a fortune on the very best clubs			1
the real secret to getting better at golf may be found in the bedroom – just not in the way men might hope for			1
scientists have found that a common treatment for heavy snorers which involves wearing a mask at night also has a powerful effect on their performance on the golf course			1
men who underwent the therapy – known as @entity22 , or @entity22 – significantly improved their driving and putting abilities			1
some were able to reduce their handicap – a measure of how many shots it takes them to complete an 18 - hole round – by nearly a third			0
the reason , researchers suspect , is that better quality sleep and fewer night - time interruptions mean golfers ’ brains are more alert and they are better able to concentrate on the game			0
@entity22 is widely used to treat the snoring - related condition called sleep apnoea			1
around three million people in @entity41 suffer with it , with one in four men and one in ten women affected			0
as sleep begins , the muscles in the airways relax and drop down towards the tongue			0
for most people this does not pose a problem but in sleep apnoea , it leads to a complete collapse which shuts off breathing for at least ten seconds			0
@entity54 vibrates against the soft tissue that stands in its way , causing the characteristic ‘ rasping ’ sound that snorers make			2
once the brain realises breathing has stopped it sends out a signal for the airway muscles to contract again			0
benefits : snorers who underwent the therapy - known as @entity22 , or @entity22 - significantly improved their driving and putting abilities ( file picture ) this opens the airway and the sufferer normally wakes with a jolt			1
in mild sleep apnoea , this can happen about once every ten minutes			0
if it ’s severe , it means sleep can be disturbed every couple of minutes			0
as well as feeling drowsy in the day , sufferers may also be at higher risk of heart attacks and strokes if they do not seek treatment			0
one recent study found heavy snorers with broken sleep were twice as likely to be hit by a potentially life - threatening stroke as men who do not snore			1
@entity22 involves donning a mask that is hooked up to a bedside machine which pumps pressurised air into the nose and mouth			1
this constant supply of pressurised air helps to keep the airways open			0
treatment : @entity22 involves donning a mask that is hooked up to a bedside machine which pumps pressurised air into the nose and mouth			1
this constant supply of pressurised air helps keep the airways open ( file picture ) sleep specialists at the @entity103 in @entity104 , @entity105 , wanted to see what affect the therapy had on golfing prowess because it requires high levels of concentration and co-ordination			2
they recruited 12 male golfers with sleep apnoea and compared them to a similar group that did not snore at night			0
each volunteer had their golf handicap calculated before the experiment			2
over the next few weeks , the heavy snorers had nightly @entity22 treatment , while the non-snorers slept peacefully as normal			1
during that time , the recruits played at least 20 rounds of golf and , at the end of the trial , their handicap was recalculated			2
the results , published in the @entity129 , showed healthy sleepers who had no @entity22 treatment saw little or no improvement in their handicap			1
but heavy snorers who wore the masks every night saw an average 11.3 per cent drop in theirs , with the most skilled golfers chipping more than 31 per cent off their score cards			1
in a report on their findings the researchers said : ‘ @entity144 is a sport that requires a range of cognitive skills			0
treatment of sleep apnoea with continuous positive airway pressure enhanced performance in golfers with the condition			2
’ professor @entity154 from the @entity155 at @entity156 said increased daytime alertness is probably the key to improved golf			2
he said : ‘ these men would be less sleepy with @entity22 and more able to concentrate			2
‘ but it ’s also possible that there was a placebo effect – whereby the men getting the treatment played better simply because they expected their performance to improve			0

heavy snorers treated with @entity22 ( @entity22 )
therapy also affects their performance on golf course , scientists found
*patients* significantly improved their driving and putting abilities
