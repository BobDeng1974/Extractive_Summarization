@entity11 , 31 , was still checking that shops kept up posters of her missing dog as recently as last year , and continued to check for details of dogs for sale with similar descriptions			2
then a friend who used to occasionally walk @entity7 spotted a dog for sale through social networking site @entity6 and showed it to @entity11 , from @entity37 , @entity13			1
she arranged to view the dog , and contacted the police to inform them of her intentions			0
officers met her at the property and went in , arresting a woman in her early 20s for handling stolen goods			1
family reunion : @entity21 , six , and @entity24 , 12 , proudly pose with the @entity9 bull terrier and pc @entity48 after the dog 's safe return @entity11 , a full - time mum , said that @entity7 had always been a part of the family			1
she said : ' @entity7 is just three weeks older than my middle daughter @entity21 , who took it hardest when he was away - they were always with each other			1
' he was my baby boy - after having girls , he was one of the kids			0
he used to sulk if @entity21 had sweets and he did n’t			0
' so when he was taken the whole family felt the loss			2
' i got the impression they were looking to steal the dog because there were lots of items they could have taken and they did n’t			0
' @entity7 is a very unusual - looking @entity9 bull terrier and i had many offers to buy him because of his unusual patterning			1
' i had just popped to my mum ’s house and was out for about an hour			0
it was not very long at all			0
' he was quite a good guard dog and we used to leave the back door unlocked			0
' my first thought when i got home was that he had escaped as there were no signs of a burglary or anything			2
' despite having been missing for almost four years , @entity11 did not stop checking for @entity7 , even visiting the dogs ’ home regularly searching for him			1
she added : ' i never wanted to give up hope			0
i would check that shops still had posters up - they wanted to take them down after a year but i would say how dogs are sometimes found after two years			0
' he even had his own @entity6 page			0
' when she first saw the picture of her dog on a selling page on the website after almost four years , she knew straight away that it was @entity7			1
' when i saw his picture i burst into tears , i could n’t believe it after all this time , ' she said			0
home comforts : police confirmed that a woman in her early 20s has been arrested in connection with the theft of @entity7 from the family home ' i rang up as a potential customer to buy him and asked all the questions about how old he was and all that			1
' when i found him i said i was n’t going to go home without him			2
' she went straight over to the address and police officers were already there waiting for her			0
@entity11 added : ' the police were @entity118 came out and asked me for any identifiable marks he had and i explained that there was a scar across his left leg from where another dog had attacked him			0
if it was n’t for that scar i do n’t know if we ’d have got him			0
' when she returned home with @entity7 on wednesday night friends and family were already there to welcome him home			1
@entity136 and @entity137 confirmed they arrested a woman in her early 20s on suspicion of handling stolen goods and that investigations are ongoing			1
- @entity11 pc @entity48 said : ' i ’m delighted to have assisted in @entity7 being reunited with his loving owners			1
there was no doubt that he also shared my delight from his reaction on seeing the family			2
' upon arrival at the scene pc @entity151 and myself were told that the dog was aggressive towards police officers but this soon proved untrue as @entity7 was a very friendly chap			2
' burglary is an awful crime and we understand , as in this case , that it can mean much more than just the inconvenience of an insurance claim			0
' to assist in returning a loved pet to its rightful home and go some way to making a bad situation better was a real heart warming experience			2
' i just hope that @entity7 can now enjoy being pampered and the family can make up for lost time			1
they all look very happy together			0
