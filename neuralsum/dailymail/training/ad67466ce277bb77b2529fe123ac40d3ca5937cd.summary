with @entity2 football being the sort of buttoned - down world in which any honestly - expressed opinion has the potential to cause offence , an outcry or vows of vengeance , some might have expected @entity11 to shy away from @entity13 ’s stated ambition of winning four trophies with @entity15 this season			1
the reason @entity11 is so keen to make on - loan @entity20 striker @entity13 a permanent part of his plans go beyond the forward ’s eye for goal – and include the cocksure confidence that makes him so positive about @entity15 ’s @entity30 chances as well as a domestic @entity31			1
thanks to the way the young @entity34 has ‘ clicked ’ at @entity35 , @entity11 thinks it puts the @entity2 champions in a great position to land him once his @entity20 contract expires at the end of the season			1
and he clearly has enormous affection for a player whose self - belief is so marked that even @entity45 has nodded his approval			2
@entity13 celebrates after scoring @entity15 's first goal in the @entity48 against @entity49 in september @entity13 has impressed for the @entity50 this season , pictured scoring a free - kick against @entity53 asked about 22 - year - old @entity13 ’s targeting of three domestic trophies plus that @entity58 prize , the @entity54 said : ‘ i believe everything is possible			1
and you have to believe			2
‘ that is why i love @entity13 , because he believes			1
you can see it in his eyes when he goes on the pitch : “ i ’m here to score , i ’m here to win			2
” and you can see it in the dressing room			2
‘ that ’s why i want to keep him as a player , get his contract permanently here , because he has the values i love			2
he ’s humble , he wants to learn , he wants to improve – and he is a winner			2
you can see that on the pitch			2
‘ i want all of our players to believe that we can win the @entity30 , of course			2
if you do n’t believe , you do n’t get it – you really have to believe it , really have to fight for it			0
‘ i think people are different			0
you ca n’t have 25 @entity84 – that would be tough for a manager ! ‘ but it ’s about the confidence you show on the pitch , the security you give to the team - mates you have			2
we have to create that together			0
this group has to commit and have a really , really strong togetherness			0
‘ i think that has grown over the last three or four weeks			0
i ’ve seen them fighting for each other , developing a team where there are no stars , just hard - working players			0
@entity13 celebrates at @entity103 against @entity104 - he is said to be loving his time at @entity15 @entity11 has already begun his attempts to keep @entity13 at @entity15 permanently ‘ when you see the best teams in the world , they have no time for people being lazy or not doing the work			1
it starts with hard work , then we need skills – and @entity13 has both			1
’ the concern for @entity15 is that @entity13 impresses at home and in the latter stages of the @entity30 - assuming progress from the group stages is secured - and then jumps at another offer likely to come the way of any hot striker			1
however , @entity11 believes that doing well in @entity125 will only enhance the player ’s desire to stay in @entity2 , saying : ‘ i think @entity13 was at @entity128 last year , he was at @entity20 and he has n’t played first - team football for two years			1
‘ it ’s like it has clicked between @entity15 and @entity13			1
one thing i know in football is that , when you are at the right club , you have to appreciate what you have			0
‘ you have to understand that your success is not all down to you , it ’s also the environment , the club that suits you and makes the best out of you			0
‘ so far , we have done that with @entity13 , together with him			1
i think he can develop a lot , he can reach a lot of his goals here			0
‘ i think it ’s vital for @entity13 to play			1
here , he gets the trust he needs – and he produces			0
he is enjoying every day			0
@entity13 exchanges words with @entity149 of @entity53 on october 26 @entity13 smiles after netting against @entity150 in september ‘ if we keep getting good results , more people will come to the stadium , he ’ll play in bigger games			1
@entity13 will be even better			1
‘ we will do everything we can in our club to make him happy , so he wants to stay			0
his contract is running out , so there is no issue there			0
’ @entity13 ’s arrival on deadline day was accompanied by plenty of pre-publicity about the young superstar who scored 20 goals in 23 appearances for @entity169 before a mystery illness left him temporarily paralysed			1
this was a boy who , backed by an unshakeable belief in his ability and tipped to be the next @entity175 in his homeland , has never believed in false modesty			0
former @entity169 and @entity15 great van @entity178 recalls hearing all about the kid who turned up in @entity181 with no reputation – but plenty of swagger – back in 2011			1
‘ @entity13 was an unknown @entity34 guy when he arrived at @entity169 , ’ said @entity45			1
‘ i ’m told , from the first moment when he arrived , everyone was surprised by his behaviour			0
he entered the dressing - room and … let ’s just say he was n’t shy			0
he had a confidence and an edge to him			0
@entity13 , pictured alongside @entity192 ( left ) in training , has scored five goals in seven games this season @entity11 described @entity13 as ' a goalscorer ' , something that is hard to come by ‘ but that was good , exactly what was needed at that time because it was a tough , tough period for @entity169			1
@entity13 then scored important goals and became a hero			1
he was part of a revival for @entity169 and they finished second in the league			0
‘ now he is at @entity15 and i also think he arrived at the right time there			1
it ’s not always been brilliant performances from the team so far , but @entity13 has given a little bit of a spark			1
his attitude has been positive and he has scored important goals			0
‘ his behaviour at @entity15 has also been a positive , in the same way i spoke about it at @entity169			1
‘ he has the self - belief to cope with the pressure of being a striker for @entity15			1
i know it can be difficult			0
but when you start to score goals and the @entity15 fans see you are giving your all for the club , then they will take you into their hearts			1
the @entity169 supporters and @entity15 supporters are very similar in that way			1
‘ over the years , many , many top strikers have played for @entity15			2
@entity13 is heading in the right direction			2
’ @entity15 ’s pursuit of four trophies sees them face @entity234 at home on @entity48 duty tomorrow night , with @entity11 insisting no - one in the home dressing room will take the match lightly			1
the manager , who insists he never even looks at the medals he won in his playing and coaching career , said : ‘ i would rather think of what i created with others			2
that ’s what drives me , to create and to have moments and experiences together			0
‘ when you do that well , you get trophies			0
it ’s the same here , we need to create something good			0
if we do that , over time we will also have trophies			2
we really want it , i really want it			0
‘ we want to win everything and the @entity48 is the first trophy available			0
that starts on wednesday against @entity234			0
