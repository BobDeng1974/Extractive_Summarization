@entity0 is encouraging @entity1 to leave his wife @entity2 at home when he attends the @entity4 in the @entity5 this year			1
@entity5 sources say the prime minister wants the summit in june to be @entity9 - free to ensure leaders remain ‘ focused ’ on issues like tackling tax avoidance , without the distraction of having their wives and girlfriends in tow			1
diplomats have begun the delicate process of enquiring whether the spouses of the world ’s most powerful individuals are happy to be left behind during one of the highlights of the global political calendar			0
@entity0 has asked that the leaders of the @entity8 , including @entity1 and @entity26 , leave their wives and husbands at home @entity30 will break from tradition and not provide an alternative list of activities for wives and girlfriends of the @entity4 leaders it is being made clear that @entity38 plans to break with @entity4 tradition and not host a separate programme of activities for visiting wives			1
if the ploy is successful it means that the likes of @entity26 and @entity46 , girlfriend of @entity49 ’s @entity48 president @entity47 , will not attend the summit , being held at the luxury @entity53 resort in @entity54			0
officials admit that they will be powerless to resist if leaders insist on bringing their wives , in which case mrs @entity38 may host a modest lunch in @entity60			1
but they hope to persuade them otherwise , in order to make the summit a business - like leaders - only affair			2
a number 10 spokesman said : ‘ the prime minister wants the @entity4 to be small , intimate and focused on the three issues of the day - tax , trade and transparency			1
other issues , like the role of spouses at the @entity4 , are yet to be confirmed			1
’ leaders such as @entity49 president @entity47 , pictured with @entity46 , may decide to bring their partners anyway			2
mr @entity0 ’s ploy is reminiscent of the stance taken by the former @entity80 football manager @entity79 who banned players ’ wives and girlfriends - dubbed the @entity9 - from attending the @entity84 in @entity85 so that they could focus on winning			2
the tactic failed when the team put in a string of dismal performances			0
@entity5 sources said mr @entity0 was inspired by last year ’s @entity4 at president @entity1 ’s @entity93 country retreat			1
the summit was attended by the leaders alone , although mrs @entity26 hosted a @entity97 lunch for visiting wives in @entity99			0
the plan to scrap the traditional programme of events for the ‘ @entity103 ’ is likely to raise eyebrows , particularly as mrs @entity38 has failed to attend any of the three @entity4 summits of her husband ’s premiership			1
the role of the wives has become increasingly elaborate in recent years			0
in 2011 a pregnant @entity110 hosted a summit on tackling global illiteracy for visiting wives when the summit came to the @entity49 resort of @entity116			0
traditionally the partners of politicians are invited to state events , but mrs @entity38 has failed to attend any of her husbands @entity121 in 2009 @entity122 was granted an audience with the @entity124 and treated to a cultural tour of @entity126 when the summit was held in the @entity129 capital			1
and @entity130 laid on a shopping spree , tree planting and drinks with the @entity134 and prince @entity135 when @entity5 last hosted the @entity4 in 2005			2
@entity5 sources insisted that mrs @entity38 was not snubbing the event and that the plan to ditch the programme for leaders ’ wives had not come from her			2
the arrangement will be greeted with relief by @entity143 , the low - profile husband of @entity144 , who shuns the limelight and rarely attends summits			0
it will also come as welcome news to security chiefs who are having to deal with an alarming resurgence in terrorist activity by dissident republicans			0
one source said : ‘ we are already trying to work out what to do if @entity156 wants to swim in the lough			0
the fewer people we have to deal with , the easier it will be			0
’ but the pared - down @entity4 is likely to disappoint members of the public in @entity54 who will miss the chance to see mrs @entity26 , mrs @entity38 and other first ladies .			1

@entity0 has asked that the @entity4 leaders leave their partners at home
he wants them to be able to focus on serious issues without distraction
@entity38 will *opt* out of providing alternative events
but , officials admit that they would be powerless if leaders decided not to comply
