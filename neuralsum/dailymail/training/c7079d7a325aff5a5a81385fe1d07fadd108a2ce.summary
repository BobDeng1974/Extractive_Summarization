for the four @entity2 men profiled on controversial new @entity4 reality series ' my husband 's @entity5 ' , it 's possible - if not common - to remain married to a woman despite having sexual feelings for other men			1
but a new study has found that relationships involving gay mormons are two to three times more likely to end in divorce than others			1
researchers surveyed 1,612 @entity20 / same - sex attracted members and former members of the @entity22 and found that between 51 percent and 69 percent of mixed - orientation marriages end in divorce			1
by comparison , only 25 percent of @entity25 couples that both identify as heterosexual end in divorce , according to the @entity30			1
here , @entity40 and @entity41 , one of the couple 's profiled in @entity44 gay , hold their daughter @entity39 co-stars : @entity47 and his wife @entity48 kiss in front of their home near @entity52 during filming of @entity6 's @entity5			1
the concept of the show has come under fire since it was announced by the @entity4 network the study was spearheaded by @entity59 , a doctoral student at @entity61 , and @entity62 , a retired @entity64 professor , with help from @entity66 , also of @entity61			2
it also found that 70 percent of people who experience @entity70 - same sex attraction - which the church prefers to gay as a label , would go on to leave the @entity25 , while 80 percent admitted to undergoing some kind of therapy to change their sexual orientation			1
the people who participated in the survey were spread across 48 states , but 45 percent were from @entity2 , as well as 22 countries			0
some 75 percent were male and 22 percent were female			0
around 7 percent were excommunication from @entity25 , 25 percent had resigned , 36 percent were inactive , 29 percent were active , and 3 percent had been disfellowshipped			0
@entity82 , the creator of @entity83 between , a documentary about @entity85 , said the data stacked up			0
he also noted the willingness of such mormons to come forward , because ' they want their story to be known and not repeated ; they want vindication for their mistreatment '			0
the release of the study coincides with the debut of ' my husband 's @entity5 ' , which has the support of @entity34 leaders but was slammed as irresponsible and dangerous by gay rights advocacy groups			1
' while the church does not promote marriage as a treatment method for same - sex attraction , couples who are trying to be lovingly supportive of each other while being true to their religious convictions deserve our support and respect , ' said church spokesman @entity112			1
the gay rights group @entity113 , however , says the show sends the wrong message and is a sad reminder of so - called gay conversion therapy , often faith - based efforts designed to change sexual orientation that can be emotionally scarring			1
@entity120 and @entity121 in 2013 banned therapists from practicing gay conversion therapy on children and teenagers			1
the @entity126 and the @entity127 do not support the therapy			2
as pro-gay groups like @entity113 vent outrage over the show 's premise , the @entity25 has spoken out in support of the unlikely tv stars ' no one can change who they love , and , more importantly , no one should have to , ' @entity113 president @entity135 said in a statement			1
' by investing in this dangerous programming , @entity4 is putting countless young @entity20 people in harm 's way			1
' the organization pointed to a change.org petition asking @entity4 to cancel the show that so far has gathered more than 80,000 signatures			0
responding to @entity113 , the network says it will tell compelling stories about different ways of life , and the four men on the hourlong show speak only for themselves			1
@entity47 , 44 , met his wife , @entity48 , more than 13 years ago after he had dated men			0
he told her he was attracted to men after they 'd been dating for about a year and a half			2
' i was devastated because i did n't know what that meant for me , ' said @entity162 , 42			0
she worried that he 'd cheat on her with a friend but said the couple 's strong connection helped her work through her questions			0
@entity41 says her marriage remains strong , including the physical aspects of their relationship			0
' we do have a happy , healthy sex life , ' she said			0
@entity41 and @entity47 both said their upbringing in @entity25 was a big part of why they wanted to remain in a husband - and - wife relationship			2
' i would say it was part of my decision early on , especially , and a big influencer of that , ' @entity41 said			0
' it certainly helped guide me toward where i 'm at today , no doubt about it			0
' @entity187 and @entity47 both said their upbringing in @entity25 was a big part of why they wanted to remain in a husband - and - wife relationship ' my husband 's @entity5 ' is not the only show about people from @entity2 in unusual marriages			1
@entity4 also airs the shows ' @entity197 ' and ' @entity199 ' about polygamous unions @entity47 said he would be horrified if a parent told a gay child that they should be more like one of the men on the show			2
' that 's not anything that i would support or agree with , ' he said			2
but @entity47 said that he 's happy with his wife and their 6 - year - old son			2
' i ca n't believe how lucky i am , ' he said .			0
