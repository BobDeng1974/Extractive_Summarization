but @entity0 says story is ' more shocking than @entity3 's headline suggest ' the prime minister of @entity5 has admitted there is a problem with citizens of his country coming to @entity10 and committing crimes			1
@entity12 said @entity14 gypsies , in particular , posed a ' huge challenge ' to law enforcement by begging and stealing mobile phones			0
he said he supported @entity10 's moves to tighten up access to benefits for @entity5 and @entity22 immigrants			1
warning : @entity5 's prime minister @entity12 has admitted there is a problem with citizens of his country coming to @entity10 and committing crimes @entity5 migrants in @entity29 , one of @entity32 's most prestigious roads			1
benefit restrictions are likely to deter @entity5 migrants from coming to @entity10 , a poll has found mr @entity12 told @entity37 's @entity36 : ' i am very aware that @entity5 citizens have committed , not serious crime , but some of them – @entity5 but also representatives of the @entity14 minority – they are doing the small criminality , begging , stealing cellular phones			1
' i think that first of all we have to co-operate			0
our police and law enforcement agencies should keep co-operating very well			0
on the other hand it is a huge challenge and a big concern for my government to implement the strategies for integration of the @entity14 communities			0
' referring to @entity58 's pledge to tighten benefits legislation to make it harder for migrants to claim , mr @entity12 said it seemed ' very fair '			0
he added : ' that would be very fair from the @entity10 point of view , i would support this			2
' all we ask is not to have discrimination , all the legislation which applies to a @entity69 citizen or a @entity71 citizen should apply also to a @entity5 or a @entity22			1
' his comments came as the @entity3 was accused of playing down the results of its own immigration survey , which found evidence that more than 100,000 @entity5 and @entity22 may come to @entity10 next year			1
seven in ten of the @entity5 who are thinking about moving to live in @entity10 would reconsider in the light of the new system the @entity36 poll of working - age migrants in the two @entity85 countries led to headlines across the @entity3 's output yesterday declaring there would not be a huge influx into the @entity10 when @entity91 restrictions end on january 1			1
but critics said an analysis of the results showed large numbers were making firm plans to come , and accused the @entity3 of concocting ' nothing - to - see - here headlines '			0
the poll quoted figures of 1 per cent of @entity5 and 4 per cent of @entity22 ' actively considering work in the @entity10 '			1
' it looks to me that the @entity3 is engaging , with its headlining of this story , not in reporting the facts , but in influencing the debate ' @entity0 leader @entity107 but the @entity109 think - tank said the small percentages represented 150,000 @entity5 and 200,000 @entity22			1
a separate question asking who was making ' concrete plans ' suggested figures of 61,000 @entity5 and 58,000 @entity22			2
arrivals on that scale would blow a hole in ministers ' efforts to cut net migration to tens of thousands by the end of the @entity122			0
sir @entity123 , @entity109 chairman , said : ' this is a stunning survey , which the @entity3 has rather desperately tried to play down			2
the percentages look small , but when multiplied by the size of the workforce they produce large numbers			0
' @entity0 leader @entity107 said : ' the @entity3 has concocted their astonishing ' nothing - to - see - here ' headlines out of a series of follow - up questions			2
if you convert their stated percentages into real figures , the story is a good deal more shocking than the @entity3 's headlines suggest			1
' the @entity3 is engaging , with its headlining of this story , not in reporting the facts , but in influencing the debate			2
' @entity145 mp @entity144 accused the @entity3 of ' spinning ' the results of the poll			2
but a @entity3 spokesman said : ' we have not spun these figures in any way			0
our reporting is in line with our usual editorial guidelines on polls , where it is important to give audiences the details of sample size			0
' we have been clear in our reporting that the surveys are a snapshot of opinion and that people 's intentions may change			0

@entity36 poll found one in 12 @entity5 would consider the @entity10
also found 13.6 per cent of @entity22 may come here this year or next
many have started looking for work and a place to live , survey says
but @entity0 says story is ' more shocking than @entity3 's headline suggest '
