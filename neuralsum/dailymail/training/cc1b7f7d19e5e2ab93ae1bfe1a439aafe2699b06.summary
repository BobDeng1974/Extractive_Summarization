the group even admitted to stealing details of the customer 's favourite pizza topping			2
@entity9 also took to @entity42 to publicise the alleged hack and advised customers to speak to their lawyers			2
in a message , @entity9 said : ' earlier this week , we hacked our way into the servers of @entity50 and @entity7 , who happen to share the same vulnerable database			1
' and boy , did we find some juicy stuff in there ! we downloaded over 592,000 customer records ( including passwords ) from @entity6 customers and over 58,000 records from @entity7 ones			1
' @entity2 's @entity6 issued a statement on @entity42 saying that although its data is encrypted , it has fallen victim to ' professionals ' who were able to ' decode the cryptographic system for the passwords '			1
@entity2 executive @entity66 then told a @entity68 newspaper that the ransom demand would not be paid , and stressed financial data , had not been compromised			0
customers of the pizza company are being advised to change their passwords ' as a security measure '			0
the breach has also been reported to @entity6 police			2
@entity9 has given a deadline of 8pm cest tonight ( 7pm bst ) for @entity78 to pay up , or the group ' will post the entirety of the data in [ its ] possession on the internet '			1
customers have been advised by @entity2 's to change their passwords ' as a security measure '			0
@entity2 's pizza and snacks are pictured a spokesman for @entity89 said : ' the data hacking is isolated to the @entity2 ’s franchise in @entity6 and @entity7 , and no customer credit card or financial information was compromised			1
' @entity2 ’s customers in the @entity95 and @entity96 are not affected by this incident			0
' the security of customer information is very important to us			0
we regularly test our @entity95 website for penetration as part of the ongoing rigorous checks and continual routine maintenance of our online operations			0
' @entity107 , vp @entity108 at @entity110 , said : ' the latest breach continues to raise public awareness of the need for encryption – not just of financial data , but also wider customer information ... breaches will happen and you ca n't stop them			0
the issue is – are you able to protect your sensitive data when a breach happens ? ' ' the fact that financial information was not compromised minimises the severity of the breach			0
but given the increasing number of data breaches we ’re seeing , it ’s clear that companies need to start thinking about encrypting more than just financial data			0
if not they run the risk of losing customers to those competitors that do			0
' despite the lack of financial details , the company has said that the @entity78 's break is still ' severe '			0
@entity142 senior security researcher at @entity144 , said : the fact that credit card details and other financial data were n’t stolen in this case is good , but the theft of personal information is bad news for customers too			2
' this is especially true of passwords since , sadly , many people use the same passwords for many of ( or all ) their online accounts			2
