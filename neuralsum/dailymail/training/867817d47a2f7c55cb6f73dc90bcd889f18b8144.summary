by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 was born with profound hearing loss in his right ear and moderate hearing loss in his left @entity2 is just like every other little boy			1
his mother says he ' loves to make noise '			0
but only two years ago , the three - year - old could barely hear a thing after being born with profound hearing loss in his right ear and moderate hearing loss in his left			1
despite the long battle ahead of him , in which he has to attend weekly speech therapy classes and audiologist appointments , his mother @entity16 from @entity17 in @entity18 , told @entity1 that her son was lucky			0
' we look at his hearing impairment as fortunate because he was born with it and we can help him at a young age , ' mrs @entity20 said			2
@entity2 is one of an estimated 3.5 million @entity26 who have some degree of hearing loss , according to @entity26 hearing			1
mrs @entity20 first found out about her son 's problem within the first week of @entity33 birth when the hospital performed a number of @entity29 ( @entity37 ) tests that brought back poor results			0
the three - year - old was fitted with a hearing aid and a cochlear implant before his first birthday he 's now starting to sing along to his favourite songs and is communicating with others perfectly for his age ' it was a bit of a shock , ' mrs @entity20 said , due to having no family history of similar problem			1
' we kept wondering " what kind of life is he going to have ? " ' but before he turned one , @entity2 was fitted with a hearing aid on his left ear , and by the time he was nine - months - old he underwent surgery to receive a cochlear implant			1
' with the implant and hearing aid , he can hear like a normal child			2
the second we had it switched on – 10 days after the operation - we could tell there was a great improvement , ' mrs @entity20 said			0
' he could hear all these different sounds , like planes overhead , so it was quite a fascinating process to watch , ' his mother , @entity20 , said of her son after he had his cochlear implant ( pictured ) mrs @entity20 ( pictured ) said the devices allow him to hear like a regular person and that her son has to have weekly speech therapy where he ' learnt how to speak from scratch ' source : @entity78 and @entity79 ' because he could already hear from his left ear through the hearing aid , we thought there would be not much of a reaction and it was a subtle reaction at first where he just had a curious look about him , but then after a week or two at home you really started to notice the difference			1
' he could hear all these different sounds , like just our movements across the floorboards and planes overhead , so it was quite a fascinating process to watch him become aware of all these sounds			0
' but it all can get a little bit too much for a little fellow , mrs @entity20 revealed , as she described a time that @entity2 refused to wear both his hearing aid and implant attachments			2
' he would break down and throw a tantrum because he did n't want to have anything on his head and that was very hard because he changed completely			0
he was very snappy and negative and would get upset often because he could n't hear			0
' and then we just persevered one day and kept putting it on until he got used to it			0
@entity2 is one of an estimated 3.5 million @entity26 who have some degree of hearing loss , according to @entity26 hearing ' we checked with his audiologist and it might have been something emotional he was going through because he did n’t have any ear aches and there was no sign of infection			1
' now , little @entity2 is more than happy to have his full hearing and only takes off his aids when he ’s tired or feeling unwell , but according to his mother , that wo n't last			2
' it 's going to come ; the day when i 'm getting him in trouble for something and he just turns them off and says " but mummy , i did n't hear ! "			0
' the organisation is promoting @entity131 , august 24 - 30 , in which they hope to inspire the thousands of people with untreated hearing loss to seek help			1
through @entity131 , @entity26 ’s can get free hearing checks with @entity26 hearing			2

before his first birthday , he was fitted with a hearing aid and a cochlear implant
