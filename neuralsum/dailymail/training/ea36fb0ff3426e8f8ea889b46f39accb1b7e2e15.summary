by @entity0 published : 03:19 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 04:01 est , 7 october 2013 computer controlled convoys of up to ten lorries could soon be driving along @entity4 's motorways in a bid to reduce the number of people killed in collisions with freight vehicles and cut fuel emissions			2
the @entity11 is to consider introducing the automated ' platoons ' with a lead vehicle communicating with following trucks via @entity15			2
the system , which was tested on a motorway in @entity18 last week , could be trialled on @entity4 roads as early as december			1
trial run : computerised convoys of up to ten lorries could become a fixture on @entity4 roads in a bid to cut road deaths and fuel emissions ( file picture ) a @entity11 fact finding team , led by chief engineer @entity28 , has been sent to @entity18 to monitor the tests			1
but while the @entity18 trials are said to have gone well , the @entity30 has raised concerns that the system could ' confuse and intimidate ' drivers on @entity4 's busy motorways			1
there are also fears that the computerised technology could be vulnerable to computer hackers			0
scientists from lorry manufacturer @entity41 claim that emissions would be lowered by as much as 10 per cent if the system was used and fuel costs would be reduced			0
warning : the @entity30 is concerned that @entity4 's roads are too small and too busy for the system to work they claim that it could also ease traffic with reduced gaps between vehicles in the convoys allowing for more traffic on the roads			1
the firm is hoping to persuade @entity57 governments to alter the @entity58 to permit automated driving on the roads			0
@entity61 from @entity41 told @entity62 : ' technology is safer than drivers , particularly in bad weather			0
' but president of the @entity30 , @entity67 , says that while the system may be useful on deserted roads in other countries , @entity4 's roads are too small and too busy for it to work effectively			1
he told @entity62 : ' there would be obvious dangers of long platoons blocking road sign , obstructing cars getting on and off the motorway and intimidating some drivers			2
' the @entity11 however , claims that the convoy system could have ' huge benefits ' if implemented on @entity4 roads			1
the system is effectively controlled by a lead vehicle which sets the following distance and speed			0
although drivers in following trucks control steering , the system automatically controls accelerating and braking			2
the position of each lorry is monitored using cameras and the close formation of the vehicles reduces drag , therefore improving fuel efficiency			0
@entity57 's freight haulage is responsible for 10 per cent of the 35,000 deaths on @entity57 roads every year .			0

@entity103 ' platoons ' are *current*ly being trialled on @entity18 motorways
the system could be tested on @entity4 trunk roads as early as december
a @entity11 team is monitoring *current* tests *abroad*
but the @entity30 claims the system could ' confuse and intimidate ' car drivers
