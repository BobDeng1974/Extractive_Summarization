the @entity0 may give up yet more of their traditional saturday 3pm kick - offs to satisfy bidders in the next tv rights tender			1
they will want to keep both @entity4 and @entity5 happy with the next three - year agreement from the 2016 - 17 season , with the packages on offer expected to be launched around the new year			2
@entity10 , who have taken the @entity12 from @entity4 , will want at least three packages out of the current seven , and @entity4 can not afford to lose any @entity0 football			1
@entity15 ( centre ) and @entity17 ( right ) appear on @entity18 @entity19 so one option being looked at by the league and mooted in ongoing talks with broadcast partners is increasing the number of live matches to be sold			2
that went up from 138 to 154 in the last auction but is still less than half the 380 games in a @entity0 season			1
an extra sunday night slot — like @entity32 ’s @entity31 — could be shoehorned into the tv schedule to give @entity5 the opportunity to screen more games , while @entity4 would at least retain their current share			1
@entity5 chief executive @entity37 has made no secret of their support for this option , saying : ‘ it is a very interesting point			2
if there were more games available we would be very interested			0
’ @entity46 ( second left ) , @entity47 ( centre ) and @entity49 ( right ) appear on @entity10 last year there is continued upset among football agents about the @entity53 allowing @entity55 ’s former personal manager @entity54 to oversee the 1966 agency which represents @entity59 players ’ commercial interests while also setting up management company @entity60			0
the middle men are threatening to turn up at @entity53 sponsors ’ events organised by 1966 to ensure players are not approached to join @entity60 , who have signed @entity65 as their first client			0
@entity65 ( right ) on the ball during @entity59 's 1 - 0 win in the @entity70 qualifier against @entity71 on sunday sir @entity72 is taking no chances with facing difficult questions while promoting the paperback edition of his autobiography			1
the first interview was with club channel @entity78 , and @entity80 supporter @entity79 , one of @entity72 ’s pals , is conducting the q&a at the @entity83 in @entity84 on sunday week			1
tickets cost £ 40 — about double the price of the @entity87 shows			0
sir @entity72 with his autobiography at a book signing at a supermarket in @entity91 last year the word within boxing is that @entity18 overlord @entity94 has been personally ringing fighters @entity96 and @entity98 , encouraging them to be part of the @entity4 pay - per - view bill at @entity102 ’s @entity101 on november 22			1
the main attraction that night is the rematch between @entity105 and @entity106 , a non-major title fight			1
it is unusual for @entity4 to demand extra money from subscribers for such a bout — hence the alleged involvement of @entity94 in beefing up the undercard			2
@entity98 with the @entity116 and @entity117 heavyweight belts after beating @entity118 in 2012 @entity119 pays by card @entity0 chief executive @entity121 donated nearly £ 30,000 to the @entity123 charity at the @entity125 tribute to @entity119			1
the sum was the result of a complex formula involving @entity119 ’s goals , appearances and medals — minus £ 50 for each of the @entity80 legend ’s 36 bookings			0
@entity119 paid the £ 1,800 himself to round the donation up to £ 30,000			0
meanwhile , @entity80 ’s senior press officer @entity136 paid £ 1,000 for a kiss from @entity139 lead singer @entity138			0
@entity119 attends the @entity125 at the @entity140 on tuesday evening it will be intriguing how long @entity144 highflyer @entity142 remains on @entity145 after being appointed chief executive of the secretive @entity147			0
certainly he is unlikely to be retweeting contentious comments about this week ’s @entity149 at @entity150 , as he did last year with one that read : ‘ let ’s start a campaign to get the @entity154 back at @entity155 , it ’s just not the same elsewhere and not interesting			0
’ @entity156 was announced as the new chief executive of the @entity147 from october 2015 @entity158 is taking place at @entity160 on saturday and the insular world of horseracing has already started the recriminations over staging such a flagship meeting at a time when the ground is always going to be risky for the flat ’s best horses			2
@entity169 , chief executive of @entity171 , is one of those with a lot of explaining to do .			0

the @entity0 may give up more of their saturday 3pm kick - offs
an extra sunday night slot could be shoehorned into the schedule
@entity79 is conducting a q&a with sir @entity72 next sunday
@entity96 and @entity98 have been asked if they want to be part of the @entity105 and @entity106 undercard
