click here for your ultimate stats guide from the game , including the move which led to @entity6 's own goal ‘ you 're getting sacked in the morning , ’ sang the @entity8 fans after @entity9 had scored @entity11 ’s third goal from the penalty spot			1
‘ that ’s a bit harsh , ’ quipped @entity11 boss @entity13			1
‘ we ’re 3 - 0 up			2
’ the chant was aimed at @entity8 manager @entity18 , but it could have applied to either of the men standing in the dug outs at @entity21			2
@entity13 is certainly on borrowed time , with @entity11 chairman @entity23 neglecting to mention his manager by name - let alone thank him - in his end - of - season address			1
the 45 - year - old was seemingly intent on enjoying his final game in charge , celebrating @entity31 ’s opening goal with self - conscious aplomb and then giving fan @entity33 his gilet and inviting him to sit on the bench in the 84th minute			1
happy ending : @entity11 booked a place in @entity38 next season with a comfy win against @entity8 comfortable : @entity13 's future as @entity11 boss is in doubt but he finished the season in style close to the edge : after seeing his side well beaten again , @entity8 boss @entity18 could also be axed @entity11 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity48 6.5 , @entity49 6 , @entity50 ( c ) 6 , chiriches 6 , @entity51 ; @entity52 6 ( @entity53 83 ' ) , @entity54 5.5 ( @entity55 62 ' - 6 ) , @entity31 6.5 ( @entity56 75 ' ) , @entity57 6 ; @entity58 6.5 , @entity9 7			1
subs : @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63			2
manager : @entity13 - 7 @entity8 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity65 5.5 , @entity66 , 5 @entity67 ( c ) 5 , @entity6 5 , @entity68 5 ; @entity69 4.5 ( @entity70 83 ' ) , @entity71 5 , @entity72 6.5 , @entity73 5 ; @entity74 4.5 ( @entity75 45 ' - 5 ) , @entity76 4.5			1
subs : @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82			2
manager : @entity18 - 4 ref : @entity84 - 6 @entity85 : @entity9 * player ratings by @entity87 at @entity21 few others possessed @entity13 ’s enthusiasm , however , as @entity11 cruised to victory through a @entity31 strike , a @entity6 own goal and then @entity9 ’s penalty after a @entity76 handball			1
but @entity13 had the last laugh too , guiding @entity11 to sixth place and ensuring his successor will have to oversee @entity99 football next season ; an increasingly poisoned chalice for any club hoping to break into the @entity104 ’s top four			1
he then proceeded to tell @entity23 to sack him or back him by extending the remaining year of his contract , and claimed it was ‘ ridiculous ’ @entity11 could have dreamt about finishing in the top four , let alone winning the title , this season			1
it was quite the farewell speech , all things considered			0
‘ there were no tears shed out there , ’ added @entity13			1
‘ this club means a lot to me but if i ’m not to continue here as a manager i ’ll be somewhere else			0
‘ it will be interesting to see what i ’ve been judged on			0
if i ’m to leave it ca n’t be on results			0
if i had started the season we would have been in the @entity124			2
’ @entity18 ’s position is also far from secure after a 15th - placed finish			0
@entity8 owner @entity127 is expected to announce plans to sell the club on monday and the fans ’ discontent with their manager was obvious			0
‘ we want our @entity8 back , ’ they sang , clad in an array of fancy dress including a post box , traffic cones and @entity138 and @entity139 from @entity140			0
@entity141 must have been on the pitch , so hopeless were their team , in the first half in particular			0
‘ i ’m every bit as disappointed as they are , ’ said @entity18			0
‘ it ’s not nice to hear , but i understand everybody ’s frustration			0
‘ the main thing for me is @entity8 is a @entity104 club			0
we ’ve got @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 to play next season			2
‘ i intend to be ( at the club ’s awards dinner on tuesday )			0
i do n’t want to pay £ 3 for a bow tie and not turn up			0
’ samba star : @entity31 celebrated his call - up to the @entity163 @entity162 squad with the opening goal fans ' favourite : the @entity167 then ran to the @entity11 faithful to enjoy the moment no luck : @entity6 scored an own goal to put @entity11 two goals in front against @entity8 @entity174 : @entity9 scored @entity11 's third goal from the penalty spot spot on : @entity9 scored from the spot after @entity76 handled @entity54 's shot @entity179 was still not fit enough even to make the @entity11 bench against @entity8			1
the right back has not yet resumed training but was assessed by the @entity184 medical team last week and was at @entity21 on sunday for the final game of the season			1
his team did not turn up on sunday though , as @entity11 ran riot in the first 45 minutes and then both sides looked forward to their summer holidays			2
@entity31 played a one - two with @entity58 and slotted in the rebound after @entity65 saved his initial shot , then @entity6 diverted a @entity193 cross into his own net under pressure from @entity9			1
a fine block from @entity72 prevented @entity58 adding a third before @entity76 handled a @entity54 shot in the penalty area			0
@entity9 slotted away the resulting spot - kick for his 14th goal of the season			1
a @entity50 header prompted a fine save from @entity65 , but @entity8 ’s chances were limited to long - range , off - target efforts by @entity72 and @entity206 , bringing more ironic cheers from the away supporters			0
it has been an underwhelming campaign for both these teams , but it is still not quite over yet			0
the chances of either @entity13 or @entity18 being in charge when the @entity104 resumes on august 16 are looking increasingly slim , after all			2
kicking out : @entity8 goalkeeper @entity65 takes his anger out on a goalpost at @entity21 changes planned : chairman @entity23 made no mention of @entity13 in his programme notes support : but @entity13 gratefully acknowledged the @entity11 fans who backed him loud and proud : loyal @entity8 fans get behind their team in the final game of a tough season for them defiant : many @entity8 fans laughed off the club 's poor form by wearing fancy dress to @entity11			1

@entity11 *qualify* for @entity38 next season with *convincing* win
@entity31 , @entity9 and @entity6 own goal on *scoresheet*
@entity23 ignores @entity13 in final programme notes of season
@entity13 invites @entity11 fan to sit *alongside* him on the bench and gave him his gilet
