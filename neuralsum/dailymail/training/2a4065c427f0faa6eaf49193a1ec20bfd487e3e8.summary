by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:20 est , 10 september 2013 updated : 03:02 est , 11 september 2013 tsar : @entity3 said it would be better for some families if parents got a job instead of having another baby mothers of large ‘ troubled ’ families should be marched to their gps for advice on contraception , a senior @entity10 adviser said yesterday			1
. @entity3 said in many troubled families would be better if parents got a job and ‘ having a baby might not be the best solution ’			1
it came as figures showed the troubled families programme which she runs had turned around the lives of 14,000 of @entity26 's most difficult households			1
prime minister @entity27 pledged £ 448 million to turn around the lives of the @entity30 's 120,000 most troubled families following the 2011 riots which swept @entity32 and other @entity26 cities			2
the @entity34 said the latest figures showed local authorities were working with 50,000 families to reduce youth crime and truancy or help get adults back on the path to work - up from 35,000 in march			2
but miss @entity3 , who worked for @entity43 ’s government before being hired by the coalition , said more had to be done to stop families having more and more children			1
speaking at the launch of the latest figures , she said : ‘ my own personal experience is that families with lots of children across lots of different age groups are stretched			0
‘ managing a 21 - year - old that 's still living with you that 's committing crime down to having another one that 's two , anybody would see that that 's a challenge			0
‘ having a baby might not be the best solution , and actually doing something just for themselves like getting a job , getting on a course , getting their health sorted out could be the right thing to do			1
‘ the best family intervention gets into the family and helps them see what 's the best way for them to go forward			0
sometimes adding another child is n't right			0
’ questioned if that should mean officials taking women to @entity13 ’ surgeris for contraception advice , she added : ‘ yes that 's right			0
i 've come across cases where that 's what some family intervention project workers have done , definitely			0
’ councils are paid up to £ 4,000 for ‘ turning around ’ troubled families			0
plan : communities secretary @entity92 said he wanted to get people off the ' sofa of despair ' several measures must be met to receive the cash , including if children attend classes , adults are taken off benefits and the cost to public services is reduced			1
the latest figures were revealed by all 152 upper tier local authorities in @entity26			0
communities secretary @entity92 said : ‘ we ’ll let local authorities look at the most difficult families – it ’s very straightforward really			2
‘ it ’s about getting children back into school , it ’s about getting people off the sofa of despair and into work and it ’s cutting down the amount of anti-social behaviour that families are committing , because often on some of the larger estates these families can be quite a nuisance			1
