' it came as an up and coming radio star says he lost his spot on the @entity201 after reporting vile @entity3 ’s abuse of young girls to bosses			0
@entity250 was a regular guest on @entity253 ’s @entity252 radio show in the early 1970s but that came to an abrupt end when he said he thought the @entity183 was a paedophile			0
mr @entity250 reported he had witnessed young teenage girls leaving @entity3 ’s scruffy motor home in an isolated area of a service station more than 40 years ago			0
but the power of @entity90 was such that @entity250 was told by @entity201 top brass to never mention the allegation again through fear that ' we could all lose our jobs			0
' @entity250 , now 67 said : ' i told my friend and producer @entity268 who passed it up to the head of religious cultural programming at the time			0
' i was called by @entity268 , who has since died , a few days after the allegation			0
i was told ‘ we will not be looking into this because they are only suspicions and because it is @entity3 , it would be dangerous to do so , as we could all lose our jobs			0
’ ' that to me says @entity3 could do what he wanted while at the @entity201 but they certainly ca n’t say they did n’t know about his abuse because i told them			0

@entity2 , son of @entity3 's sister @entity10 , says it would spare anguish for victims and families with loved ones buried in same @entity13 cemetery
