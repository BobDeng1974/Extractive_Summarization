writing for @entity1 , ex-mp mr @entity5 warned that without a new leader the @entity8 faced ‘ destruction ’			1
in a damning assessment of the deputy prime minister ’s performance , mr @entity5 claims that if the party were a business ‘ he ’d have been fired a long ago ’			1
clash : @entity18 mp @entity5 said it was ' nothing personal ' but @entity2 has to quit as @entity8 leader the searing criticism from one of the @entity8 ’ best known figures comes after peer @entity25 warned the @entity8 could be reduced to just 20 seats at the next election and called for mr @entity2 to quit			1
mr @entity2 sought to brush off the attack from a long - standing critics , insisting : ‘ he tends to always do so like clockwork at this time of year			0
‘ when it 's conference and the weather turns bad , up pops @entity25 with some disobliging remarks about me			1
’ tonight in an address to the party faithful in @entity40 , mr @entity2 tried to ignore his critics and instead urged ‘ unity ’			1
‘ since our party was formed , every step of our journey has been taken together , ’ he said			2
‘ we have decided the policies , fought the campaigns and taken on the vested interests			0
‘ we decided , together , to go into government			2
people who do n’t understand us like to call debate division			2
‘ i think it is debate that give us our unity			2
unity about what we want to see for our country			2
’ but after three and a half years in government , many @entity61 dems remain deeply uneasy about the power - sharing deal			2
with the party stubbornly stuck at around 10 per cent in the polls , behind @entity67 , there are fears many @entity69 will be lost at the 2015 election			1
blue : mr @entity2 , who was greeted by business minister @entity71 in @entity40 , has sought to laugh off calls for his resignation mr @entity5 , who has called for a new leader before , warns the party will be lucky to retain half of its 57 seats with mr @entity2 in charge			1
he writes : ‘ i ’ve got nothing against @entity2 personally			0
‘ and the truth is , if the @entity8 were a business , he ’d have been fired a long ago			0
‘ no ‘ chief executive officer ’ could survive such terrible performance indicators : a catastrophic decline in membership , a virtual halving of local councillors , a dreadful deposit - losing @entity87 mayoral result and the worst poll ratings in over two decades			0
’ however , mr @entity5 himself was the butt of a series of jokes in the conference hall			1
@entity99 , @entity8 leader in @entity100 , backed the party 's campaign for 1million extra jobs , saying : ' why do we need to keep talking about jobs , jobs and more jobs ? we need to find @entity5 one			1

he went on : ‘ @entity2 has already done irreparable damage to @entity8 prospects in the next general election – making his stated goal of doubling the number of @entity69 a risible joke			0
‘ @entity2 ’s legacy will then be nothing less than the destruction of decades of effort by me and other activists , only to have seen our investment evaporate in five short years			2
’ however allies of the deputy prime minister have made clear they think the party needs to ‘ grow up ’ and accept the tough responsibilities of being in government			1
@entity139 minister @entity138 urged left - leaning @entity8 to stop attacking the government they serve in			1

we can not claim credit for the popular policies but pretend the unpopular policies are nothing to do with us			0
‘ we can not be in the government but campaign against the government at the same time			0
‘ the @entity8 are an independent party and we will stand on our own manifesto , but we will only get the credit for our achievements if we unambiguously stand by our record in @entity148			0
‘ no craving the easy gesture politics of opposition			0
we have risen to the challenge and we have served our country well			0
we deserve to stay in office and continue our positive work			0
‘ the @entity8 should be proud of our government			0
