solitary polar bears have become the poster boys of global warming			1
standing on melting glaciers , their saddened faces are often plastered over posters , adverts and brochures warning of the dangers of greenhouse gas emissions			0
but some scientists say polar bears , are far from endangered			2
instead , they claim , the creatures are being used as political weapons in the heated debate on climate change			0
scroll down for interactive map and video some scientists say polar bears , are far from endangered			0
instead , they claim , the creatures are being used as political weapons in the heated debate on climate change ' @entity27 say that now is the " time with the most bears " , ' @entity23 , a biologist who has been researching polar bears in @entity25 and around the @entity26 for 30 years , told @entity29			1
' in spite of claims to the contrary , there is no reliable scientific evidence that polar bear numbers have declined in any subpopulation so far			1
' there are an estimated 25,000 bears in the whole of the @entity26 and around 60 per cent of those are in @entity25 , according to the @entity40 ( @entity40 )			0
the @entity40 estimates that we could lose two - thirds of the world 's polar bears by the middle of the century unless the world takes action on climate change			1
but the same group earlier this year admitted to polar bear specialist @entity50 that the estimate was ' simply a qualified guess given to satisfy public demand			0
' @entity55 , a professor of biological sciences at the @entity57 and past @entity40 chair , has spent 30 years studying polar bears			2
' in spite of claims to the contrary , there is no reliable scientific evidence that polar bear numbers have declined in any subpopulation so far , ' @entity23 , a polar bear scientist with 30 years experience , told @entity29 a new tool allows people to watch polar bears as they pad across the ice of @entity73 , @entity25 , from the comfort of their homes			1
the @entity76 ( interactive map below ) shows the current location of a number of polar bears as well as sea ice levels in the area			1
by clicking on a bear in the interactive map , you can see what date it was collared , how many cubs it has , its weight and the distance it has travelled			0
there is also an option to sponsor the bear			0
the map , created by @entity97 - based @entity96 , can also be used to see the shrinking of areas of sea ice over the past 30 years , as water temperature are believed to have risen			0
despite the controversy over numbers , he is adamant that polar bear groups will start going extinct by mid-century as a direct result of climate change			2
' it is an international standard to consider conservation of a species using the " three generation rule " looking forward in time , ' he told @entity29			0
' for polar bears , three generations is somewhere in the 36 to 45 year timeframe			0
in this timeframe , sea ice scientists , predict significant changes in the amount of the @entity26 covered in sea ice			2
' according to the @entity123 's @entity122 ( @entity122 ) , ice levels are ' likely ' to fall below one million square kilometres by 2050 due to man - made global warming			1
' polar bears are a habitat specialist : they are not found anywhere that sea ice does not persist			2
if the sea ice disappears , the bears will too			0
' but dr @entity23 takes issue with both dr @entity55 's and the @entity122 's predictions on climate change			1
' climate models have actually done a poor job of predicting climate warming and sea ice decline , ' he said			2
the @entity76 , created by @entity96 , shows the current location of a number of polar bears as well as sea ice levels in the area			1
click on a polar bear to view its details ... ' polar bears are a habitat specialist : they are not found anywhere that sea ice does not persist			2
if the sea ice disappears , the bears will too , ' said @entity55 , a professor at the @entity57 ' my crystal ball says that suggestions of 4.5 - 5 Â° c warming is unlikely given the warming so far and given the limitations on fossil fuel			2
' in 2008 , dr @entity23 signed the @entity156 on climate change , which argued that there was no conclusive evidence that emissions from industrial activity was causing climate change			1
he said that if @entity164 is really driving the current warming trend , then we could see maybe another degree of warming , which would not be a threat to polar bears			0
' it is not a crisis , just a change that is within the range of historical variation , ' he added			0
and even if polar bears did suffer a loss of ice , dr @entity23 points out that , as a species , polar bears have survived for four million years and have ' behavioural plasticity '			1
' that means they evolved even before the @entity184 glacial cycles , even before there was perennial sea ice in the @entity187 , ' he said			0
and he points out that polar bears can live on stored fat to live for long periods			0
pregnant females , for instance , can go eight months without eating			0
there are an estimated 25,000 bears in the whole @entity26 and around 60 per cent of those are in @entity25 dr @entity23 said that since he made his views known , he has been ostracised by the polar bear scientific community			1
indeed , dr @entity55 is outspoken in his views on scientists who do n't believe that polar bears are threatened by climate change			1
' some of the scientists that are claiming resilience in polar bears are being paid by right - wing climate change denier groups , ' he said			1
' these individuals are paid to obfuscate the scientific data			0
' if polar bears could garner the resources they need on land , why do they lose about 0.8 - 0.9 kg of body mass per day ? ' why do some polar bears starve while on land waiting for the sea ice to reform ? ' but dr @entity23 claims the figures just do n't add up			1
' i think it is a bit crazy to speculate about a climate future 50 or 100 years in advance , then guess about how polar bears might respond to this hypothetical climate future , then declare a crisis because the guess was they wo n't do very well , ' said dr @entity23			1
' especially when the current models do n't seem to be able to predict either temperature or sea ice very well so far			0
' according to the @entity40 ( @entity231 ) , we could lose two - thirds of polar bears by the middle of the century unless the world takes action on climate change			1
but dr @entity23 claims the figures just do n't add up			2

estimates say we could lose two - thirds of polar bears by mid-century
some claim global warming has caused a fall in sea ice levels in @entity26
but dr @entity23 says ' there no reliable scientific evidence ' of decline
he believes polar bears can survive moderate change *weather* patterns
dr @entity55 claims that polar bears can not adapt to *conditions*
' some of the scientists that are claiming resilience in polar bears are being paid by right - wing climate change denier groups , ' he told @entity29
