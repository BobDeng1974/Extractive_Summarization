lucky : @entity0 is seen as the world 's favourite number - and it appears across many cultures and religions stop any person in the street and ask them to choose an odd number between 1 and 10			1
more often not , they will say the number 7			1
for ‘ lucky 7 ’ is the world ’s favourite number			1
there are seven days of the week , seven colours of the rainbow , seven notes on a musical scale , seven seas and seven continents			2
@entity21 ran off to live with seven dwarves , there were seven brides for seven brothers , @entity20 described the seven ages of man , @entity28 had seven voyages			2
and when @entity30 was looking for a code for @entity32 , he did n’t go for 006 or 008			2
only 007 had the right ring			2
this week , a poll of 30,000 people confirmed that 7 is overwhelmingly our favourite number — with 3 in second place			1
a remarkable ten per cent of those surveyed gave 7 — from the infinite choice of numbers available — as their lucky number			1
but why do we prefer some numbers to others ? what is so special about 7 ? and how can something as dry as a number generate such strong emotions ? our fascination with certain numbers goes back to the dawn of recorded history			1
for the @entity55 the most meaningful number was 60			1
they based their mathematics and calendar around it — and we , many centuries later , have inherited their system			2
that ’s why an hour has 60 minutes , and a minute 60 seconds			0
in @entity63 , 12 was considered special			0
in @entity66 mythology there were 12 realms of the dead			0
indeed , 12 crops up throughout history — inches to a foot , pennies to a shilling , months of the year , the number of apostles			1
a day is split into two cycles of 12 hours			0
there are sensible reasons to venerate 60 and 12			0
both divide neatly into halves , quarter and thirds , making them ideal units of currency and measurement			0
but that does n’t explain why humans are still so hung up on 7 — a prime number that can not neatly be divided by anything other than itself and number 1			1
@entity30 chose 007 over other numbers and @entity92 chose seven dwarfs for @entity21 mathematician @entity94 , who carried out the survey as part of research for his book on maths , @entity100 , says an emotional attachment to numbers — and 7 in particularly — is surprisingly common			1
‘ when i give talks about maths and ask the audience if they have a favourite number , half stick up their hands , ’ he says			1
‘ i suppose we are all a little bit obsessive compulsive			0
it ’s comforting to have a favourite number			1
’ favourite numbers are usually linked to birthdays , anniversaries or house numbers			1
but some people have the strangest reasons			1
when asked why she voted for 7 in the poll , one woman said : ‘ it is a bit awkward ; it ca n’t be equally divided and wo n’t bend to the rules so easily			1
’ @entity94 argues that some numbers are inherently more appealing than others			0
small numbers tend to be more popular than large ones , for example			0
we are most familiar with the numbers 1 to 10 , and tend to pick our favourites from those			0
most people see odd numbers as more exotic than even ones			1
‘ our brains see numbers and want to try to split them in two , ’ says @entity94			0
‘ they ca n’t do that with odd numbers so people feel their “ personalities ” are different and more appealing			1
’ can numbers be funny ? author @entity144 spent some time deciding that 22 was funnier than 11 or 14 we also seem to be attracted to prime numbers			0
again , the fact that we ca n’t divide them cleanly makes them more distinctive			0
so when looking for a favourite number , that makes 3 , 5 and 7 the most likely candidates			1
but @entity94 ’s survey also revealed people do n’t like numbers ending in 5			1
we are so used to rounding up numbers to the nearest multiple of 10 that numbers finishing in 5 seem oddly unsatisfactory			0
that knocks 5 out the running , and three — the second favourite — misses out on first place , possibly because it is just too mundane			1
after all , we see groups of 3 everywhere we look : traffic lights with 3 colours , sets of knives , forks and spoons , 3 hands on a clock , 3 meals a day			0
so the less common 7 , then , takes the crown			1
if you do n’t believe our brains behave as predictably as this , try this mind - reading test on a family member or friend			0
ask them to think of a two - digit number less than 50			1
tell them both the digits must be odd and different			0
say that they ca n’t have 11 but could have 13			0
when psychologists tried this in experiments , more than a third chose 37			0
the trick works because there are actually only eight numbers someone is allowed to choose from — 13 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 31 , 35 , 37 and 39			1
and by mentioning the number 13 in the preamble , you put them off that one			1
but time after time , despite having 7 combinations of numbers to choose from , the lure of 7 combined with the second favourite number 3 draws people to choose 37			1
it ’s a prime number and the most ‘ exotic ’			1
and what about the numbers we do n’t like ? in @entity94 ’s poll , people could nominate any whole number they liked			1
the lowest number that had no nominations was 110			1
@entity213 tradition states seven is the number of intelligence , and there are seven @entity217 in the @entity218 year			1
elsewhere , the traditional @entity219 , pictured , has seven branches @entity94 is unsure why			0
however , his research has shown people are n’t as keen on numbers ending in 0 — perhaps because we are so used to seeing numbers rounded to the nearest 10 and so it loses its distinctiveness			1
if numbers can be attractive , can they also be funny ? are there people for whom 88 brings a wry smile , but who ’d never laugh at 50 ? @entity144 , author of the war satire @entity233 spent ages discussing numbers with his agent before deciding that 22 was funnier than 11 or 14			2
@entity238 , the creator of @entity239 , said he chose 42 as the answer to the ‘ ultimate question of life , the universe and everything ’ because it was an ‘ ordinary , smallish number ’			2
the joke works because the answer — worked out by the most powerful computer in existence over seven - and - a - half - million years — is a crushing anti-climax			2
fear of the number thirteen is called @entity252 , a word coined in 1911 , and superstitious sufferers associate the number with bad luck and misfortune			2
in tarot cards , @entity258 is the thirteenth card in a deck , while the end of the @entity263 's @entity262 , or cycle , was said to be the time of the apocalypse in 2012			2
in religion , @entity267 , who betrayed @entity268 in the @entity269 , was the thirteenth member at the last supper			0
friday the 13th is considered the unluckiest day of the month			0
but in @entity273 , 13 is considered a lucky number , especially when gambling , whereas 17 is considered unlucky			2
although it is not known why these numbers hold this significance in @entity273 , 17 is linked with bad luck because when written in @entity281 , it can be rearranged to spell the @entity283 word vixi meaning ‘ i have lived ’ - found on ancient tombstones			0
@entity94 ’s poll only asked people for their favourite number			1
but if it had asked for the number they hate , the answer would inevitably have been 13			2
the fear of 13 — or @entity252 — is so widespread that one in ten people are thought to suffer from it			2
many large hotels go straight from the 12th to the 14th floor			0
no one knows why 13 is thought to be unlucky , but there are many theories			0
one is that it represents @entity267 , the 13th apostle , who betrayed @entity268 at the @entity301			0
another is that it comes from @entity303 , where evil was introduced to the world by the mischievous god @entity306 at a party in @entity308 , the home of the gods			2
according to the legend , he was the 13th guest to arrive			0
the grip of 13 is so great that the risk of having a road accident goes up on friday the 13th			0
not because the day is unlucky , but because superstitious drivers tended to be more anxious — and so more accident prone			0
getting hung up about numbers can also reduce your odds of winning a fortune			0
people who pick ‘ lucky ’ numbers such as 3 and 7 are just as likely to win the lottery as people who pick numbers out of the hat			1
but if they hit the jackpot , they have to split the cash with more winners			0
that ’s what happened on november 14 , 1995 , when 133 tickets shared the £ 16 million prize — each winner got just £ 120,000			0
the winning numbers were 7 , 17 , 23 , 32 , 38 , 42 and 48 — all popular numbers with players			2
there are some occasions when 7 is not so lucky after all .			2
