by @entity1 reporter published : 19:38 est , 5 january 2014 updated : 06:12 est , 6 january 2014 dr @entity3 warned that @entity4 needed an extra £ 1 billion of taxpayers ' money to recruit sufficient staff to keep practices open at weekends more than 20,000 extra gps , nurses and other @entity15 staff are needed if @entity16 wants his plan for surgeries to open seven days a week to work , the head of the family doctor 's royal college has warned			1
in her first major television interview since taking up the post , dr @entity3 told @entity21 that @entity4 needed an extra £ 1 billion of taxpayers ' money to recruit sufficient staff to keep practices open at weekends			1
without the extra money , the @entity15 risks becoming unsustainable as gps and hospitals struggle to cope with the extra demand from patients over the winter months , she said			1
dr @entity3 took over as head of the @entity32 in november , a month after the prime minister declared his intention to get @entity4 to work more hours			1
but in an outspoken attack on the policy to be broadcast today she said that the idea was unrealistic unless the government was prepared to fund more staff			1
gp numbers would need to increase by a quarter alone , she suggested			1
' if we were to move to seven days a week we would need 10,000 more gps , ' she said			2
' we probably need the same number of practice nurses and a proportionate number of support staff			2
we do n't think seven days a week is realistic '			2
according to the @entity48 there are just over 40,000 gps currently working in the @entity50			2
the @entity32 has previously suggested that 10,000 more would be needed for 7 day a week opening to function			1
however , it is believed to be the first time the college has warned that an equivalent number of nurses and support staff would be required as well			2
in a dire assessment of the current state of gp practices , dr @entity3 said that family doctors feel ' besieged ' as they struggle to deal with the influx of winter patients			1
' it is constant demand with very little let up , ' she said			1
' we know our colleagues are working 11 - 12 hour days and that is really difficult to do day after day when it is a job you need to be on top form for			2
they are feeling pressurised and besieged and looking for a bit of respite			2
' waiting times for appointments were rising , she said , leading to concerns that their treatment could be compromised			0
@entity4 need more resources , she said			0
' the consequence ( of not having extra resources ) will be the winter pressure effect that comes up every year gets longer and longer			1
my fear is the whole of the @entity15 becomes unsustainable due to the failure to properly invest in general practice			1
' dr @entity3 took over as head of the @entity32 , based in @entity91 , @entity92 , in november she also criticised the government 's £ 500 million to hospitals to cope this winter			1
' it was n't the best use of money			0
it was a short term fix , finger in the dyke stuff , ' she said			0
' there is nothing about the use of that money that will stop the same pressures emerging again and again			0
' and she denied that full gp practices were to blame for increased numbers attending @entity110 ' the problem is we have an increase in the number of patients turning up in ambulances very sick			0
' in october the prime minister said he would like @entity119 surgeries to open from 8am until 8pm and over the weekends to fit in with the lifestyles of working people			0
he said a £ 50m pilot scheme would be rolled out across the country			0
he told @entity21 : ' sometimes people using accident and emergency really just need to see a gp but for hard - working people it is often too difficult because you are at work , you ca n't get an appointment at the time that fits			0
' let 's see if we can have @entity4 ' surgeries open 12 hours a day , seven days a week so you can always get that appointment you need			0
' a @entity135 spokesperson said : ' gps do a vital job which is why we increased their overall budget last year as part of our protection of @entity15 funding			1
we have made £ 50 million available to help innovative gps to extend their services and stay open longer — either on their own or by working with other local practices			0
we have also asked @entity146 to see how we can get 50 per cent of medical students to become gps			0
' our changes to the gp contract will free gps from unnecessary red tape so they can devote more time to patients			0
this goes hand in hand with a £ 3.8billion fund to join up health and social care and support the delivery of integrated services			0
