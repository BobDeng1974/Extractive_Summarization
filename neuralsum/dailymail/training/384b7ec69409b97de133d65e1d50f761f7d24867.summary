by @entity0 a few decades ago astronomers were pretty confident they knew how planets formed			2
based on our own solar system they thought small , rocky planets formed near their host star and larger , gaseous or icy planets formed further out			1
so when they started finding planets that did n’t conform to any of these theories they were confused : were their prevailing theories of planet formation wrong ? theories of planet formation are being tested as astronomers find bizarre new worlds in the universe			1
this artist 's illustration shows the planet designated @entity22 orbiting close to its host star , despite being the size of @entity26			0
known as a ' hot @entity26 ' , this is a type of planet that was once thought not possible to exist in the last 20 years , reports nature , we have found worlds we never thought possible			2
most massive 28.5 @entity33 : @entity34 - p j082303.1 - 491201 b least massive 0.02 @entity36 : @entity37 shortest orbit 5.8 hours : @entity39 system with most planets nine : @entity42 planet with most stars four : @entity45 for example , some planets have been found so close to their star that they orbit in just days - but density studies indicate these planets are somehow made of ice			2
other rocky planets have been found so big that they have led astronomers to question exactly how planets can form			0
the current model of planet formation is that they are born out of the dust and gas that also creates the star at the core of a planetary system , known as the core - accretion process			1
as the central star rotates it spins the surrounding material and heats it			0
other time this material clumps together , with materials with high melting points like iron and rock forming nearer the sun. further out in the system it is colder , allowing ice to form , while planets also accumulate some of the gas in their vicinity , becoming ‘ gas giants ’ like @entity26 and @entity84 in our own			0
why , then , have we found systems where there are gas giants in orbit a tenth the distance of @entity90 in our own solar system ( known as ' hot @entity33 ' ) ? why do some planetary systems have giant ‘ super-earths ’ , huge rocky planets devoid of a gaseous exterior , orbiting in their extremes ? and why , too , do some planets orbit in wildly elliptical orbits rather than in a flat ‘ plane ’ like those in our solar system ? the answer : we just do n’t know			1
previously it was thought our solar system was the norm for how planets form			1
but the discovery of worlds unlike any of the eight planets around our sun suggests the preconceived notion that gas giants form far out and rocky planets inwards ( illustrated ) is not necessarily correct this graph shows the different sizes of planets discovered by @entity118 as of january last year			0
although the number of planets we know of has increased since then , it shows how many different types of planets we found , many of which are not even planets that exist in our own solar system it 's possible that , in some systems , planets are knocked into wild orbits by others , or they are captured by a star as it passes			1
the process of planet formation itself might , too , be more chaotic than we once thought			1
‘ the first detections of exoplanets revealed bodies which are utterly unlike any solar system planet , ’ says @entity139 , ‘ and subsequent discoveries have shown that many exoplanet systems are very dissimilar from ours			1
‘ in some exosystems , planets as massive as @entity26 orbit so close to their star that they are heated to high temperature and their upper atmospheres are swept into space			0
‘ in other systems , planets follow elongated orbits ( in contrast to the nearly circular orbits of the solar system )			1
’ however , this is not necessarily a bad thing			0
finding planets that do n’t conform to our theories merely means that we have n’t quite nailed down how planet formation works yet			1
it may even be that our solar system is fairly unique when compared to other planetary systems			2
after all , for one thing our system contains no ‘ super-earths ’ , whereas they seem to be common elsewhere in the galaxy			0
another mystery is the abundance of super-earths ( illustration of kepler - 62f shown ) elsewhere in the universe			0
why do other planetary systems host at least one of these giant rocky planets , whereas our own solar system has none ? astronomers will be hoping to answer this question in future with new theories ‘ out studies of exoplanets are just beginning , and it is not possible to be sure what will prove to be “ typical ” planets among our neighbouring stars , ’ says @entity139			1
‘ will most planet systems prove to be much like our own , or are we exceptional in more ways than we can imagine ? only years of further study will tell			0
’ that is not to say there are not exoplanet systems like our own , though ; the star @entity202 , 41 light years away , has a system of five planets with a similar distribution to our own			2
but it may be that our theories for how these planets formed in the first place , and what sort of systems they inhabit , may need to be revised			2
‘ perhaps the most interesting question , and one of the most difficult to answer , concerns the uniqueness of the @entity36 , ’ concludes @entity139			0
‘ are there planets similar to the @entity36 around other stars and does life exist on any other planet beyond our own @entity36 ? ’			0

astronomers are being forced to *rewrite* their theories of planet formation
@entity225 - based @entity139 and others are *struggling* to *explain* them
previously it was thought our solar system was a model of other systems
but the discovery of bizarre planets in odd orbits has *challenged* theories
some huge planets are in tight orbits that defy our current laws of planets
lots of other systems also have super-earths , but our system has none
the discovery of these new planets is leading astronomers to change tack
