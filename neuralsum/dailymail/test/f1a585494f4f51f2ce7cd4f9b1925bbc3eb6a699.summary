car - congested cities could become a thing of the past , provided people are prepared to ride - share with a robot driver			1
a new study claims these ' taxibots ' could cut the number of cars needed to perform the same number of journeys per day by 90 per cent			2
the finding comes amid reports that companies such as @entity13 and @entity14 are working on technology to develop driverless taxis			1
pictured is an interior view of a @entity13 self - driving car showing the video and the data the car uses to ' see ' the road			1
@entity13 is believed to be working on technology for self - driving cabs , but has n't revealed details the study , by @entity33 - based @entity32 used data from @entity35 in @entity36			1
by plugging the data into a computer model , they simulated how such self - driving , communal cabs would affect traffic			1
even with only one passenger per ride and no complementary public transport , the number of cars still dropped by 77 per cent			1
the authors said replacing personal cars with self - driving cabs would also free valuable real estate currently used for public parking - equivalent to over 200 football pitches in @entity35 ’s case			1
major technology firms are already banking on self - driving taxis to be the future of transportation			1
even with only one passenger per ride and no complementary public transport , the number of cars still dropped by 77 per cent			1
in this image is one @entity13 's autonomous vehicles pictured with @entity13 chairman @entity62 ( left ) and @entity64 transportation secretary @entity63 ( right ) last year , for instance , ride - sharing service @entity14 said it could replace all of its drivers with autonomous vehicles			1
ceo @entity71 admitted the technology would keep costs down , and these savings could then be passed on to its customers			0
@entity76 , who is co-ordinating the trials told @entity78 that an accident involved a driverless car is inevitable - although he added none have taken place in his pilots			2
' systems will fail , people 's judgements will fail , ' he said			0
' if someone jumps out from a blind spot from a vehicle , if it ca n't stop , it ca n't stop			0
' a recent report by the @entity93 highlighted research that showed human drivers change their behaviour when using the same roads as autonomous cars			0
motorists were found to copy the driving style of the computer controlled cars by leaving less space between them and the vehicle in front , but were less able to react quickly			1
however , many experts say that driverless cars could actually reduce the risk of accidents as computers are able to react a lot faster than humans			2
@entity13 has also been teaching its vehicles to drive more safely by giving them instructions on ' defensive driving ' styles			2
they have also been experimenting with teaching the vehicles ' body language ' to communicate with other drivers what its intentions are			0
speaking at the @entity126 in @entity127 , @entity71 said : ‘ the reason @entity14 could be expensive is because you 're not just paying for the car - you 're paying for the other dude in the car			1
‘ when there 's no other dude in the car , the cost of taking an @entity14 anywhere becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle			2
’ @entity13 was an early backer of the @entity141 - based firm , investing $ 258 million ( £ 170 million ) in the controversial ride - sharing service through its venture capital arm in august 2013			2
but last month unnamed source told @entity145 that @entity13 is preparing to offer its own taxi service , and it was likely to use its driverless cars			2
the report said that @entity13 had told @entity14 's board of this possibility , and executives had seen screenshots of what appears to be a @entity13 ride - sharing app , currently being used by employees			1
while driverless taxis are still some way off from becoming a reality , a separate report last month found they could soon find their way into our airports and campuses			2
ten @entity64 cities will roll out automated vehicle pilot projects this year , with the first being unveiled in @entity167 , @entity168 in the spring			0
meanwhile , trials will launch in another 12 to 20 @entity64 locations by the end of next year , which means driverless cars could be on the roads in up to 30 @entity64 cities by 2017			0
as well as the @entity64 , the @entity174 will also be trialing the vehicles in @entity176 as part of the $ 9 million project called @entity179 , shuttling people to the @entity181			0
the finding comes amid reports that companies such as @entity13 and @entity14 are working on technology to develop driverless taxis some will be on the roads where it 's legal , ' @entity76 , a strategist @entity187 , who is running the trials told @entity78			1
passengers can set their destination on some of the vehicles by typing it into a map or using commands			0
a combination of radar , lasers gives the car a 360 - degree ' view ' , with sensors linked to computer software able to ' see ' and identify people , cars , road signs and markings and traffic lights			1
' it 's interesting to see people 's reactions ' , said @entity76			0
' very few are nervous , or noticeably nervous			0
' we 've had interesting reactions from non-riders too			0
we were in the @entity215 and we had hundreds of people step in front of the vehicle to see what would happen			0
' ' the vehicles stopped			0
we 've never had an accident			0
' major technology firms are already banking on self - driving taxis to be the future of transportation			1
pictured is an illustration of how a map within a driverless cab would identify a cars lane position in relation to the rest of the road network			0

computer model simulated how driverless cabs would affect @entity35 traffic
even with only one passenger per ride , car number dropped by 77 per cent
*swapping* personal cars with self - driving cabs would free valuable space
