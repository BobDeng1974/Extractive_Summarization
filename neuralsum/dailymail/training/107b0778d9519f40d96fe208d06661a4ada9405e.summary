the complexity of our change programme and its dependencies is significant - with plenty of risk			0
' we will need all of our current resource allocation - and the freedom to reinvest savings in equipment support - if we are to deliver @entity11 2020 in a balanced manner and realise mr @entity58 ’s commitment to a firm foundation of men and materiel , well trained , well equipped and fully funded to operate in the nation ’s interests			1
