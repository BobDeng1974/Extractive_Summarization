click here for all the best stats , analysis and heat maps from the quarter - final clash @entity5 are out of the @entity6 – did anyone notice ? for @entity5 were @entity8 as they bid a meek au revoir to the tournament ; there was certainly no @entity12			1
at least those who fell at the last - 16 stage went down fighting			2
they had promised so much during a group stage in which they scored eight times , adding two more in their second - round disposal of @entity35			2
but in @entity38 , against @entity16 , they surrendered , @entity24 ' 12th - minute header proving enough to settle a largely staid affair			1
in the subsequent 82 minutes - including injury - time - @entity5 found the target just five times			1
@entity42 was under pressure to drop @entity44 and restore @entity45 to a central role , and that he duly did			1
@entity45 , though , failed to repay his manager ’s faith			0
he completed just 12 passes in 90 minutes and , although he managed seven attempts on goal , a meagre two troubled @entity52			0
his first - half performance - in which his eight touches was the least of all 22 players – was particularly subdued and he lacked conviction when a pair of chances did come his way , one header rebounding off a defender a shot side - footed tamely at @entity63			1
but @entity45 ’s supporting cast did little to aid the attacking cause either			0
not - so - perfect 10 : @entity45 was disappointing and headed this early chance straight into @entity67 down and out : @entity68 barely threatened to reply and went out with a whimper too little , too late : @entity45 came closest to levelling with a late strike which was saved by @entity52 quiet : @entity45 's first - half heat map shows his subdued effort not enough : @entity45 was a little more involved after the break but still could n't find a breakthrough @entity75 , the playmaker , created just one chance for a team - mate , while his passing accuracy in the opposition half dipped to 61 per cent compared to 81 in the comfort of defensive territory			1
the disappointing @entity83 midfielder was withdrawn when his team should have been chasing a leveller 17 minutes from time			0
no @entity26 connection : @entity75 did not exert his influence in the right areas easy option : @entity75 was involved , but it was all inside the comfort of his own half no impact : the playmaker 's numbers in the final third make for poor reading @entity98 was @entity44 's replacement in the starting line - up but the 23 - year - old did little to enhance his reputation			1
the winger 's involvement was sporadic and just over half of his 22 passes found a colleague			0
@entity108 , like @entity75 , failed to impact in the final third , while @entity111 's crossing was woefully wayward and just one of his six deliveries located a comrade			0
@entity115 , meanwhile , was unable to carve a single opening despite completing the full game			0
of those introduced in an attempt to snap @entity5 from their slumber , @entity44 and @entity118 did not muster one shot on goal between them			2
@entity45 was denied by @entity52 's strong arm in stoppage - time , but it was too little , too late .			0

@entity42 ' @entity5 side lost 1 - 0 to @entity16 in the @entity6 2014 quarter - finals
@entity5 *conceded* early on in the game and failed to pose a serious threat to @entity16 afterwards
@entity26 only managed five shots on target throughout the match
