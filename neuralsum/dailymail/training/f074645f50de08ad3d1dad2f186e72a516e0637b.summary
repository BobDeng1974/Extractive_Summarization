' when she was seven @entity3 split up with her aunt , who asked not to be named , and miss @entity1 did not see him again			1
she says : ' i was so thankful that i would n't have to endure anymore of his abuse			0
but what he had done stayed with me			0

i 'd hide at school until the school bus left and then i 'd walk home			0
found courage : ms @entity1 , pictured with her daughter @entity111 and boyfriend @entity112 , said she finally built up the courage to report paedophile @entity3 after having a child of her own ' i was desperate to tell someone the truth , but i was still terrified that @entity117 would hunt me down and kill me			1

he convinced me to tell mum			0
more than a decade had passed and i was worried she would n't believe me			2
' miss @entity1 's mother told her to report @entity3 to the police but she refused saying she was still ' too scared to speak up , petrified that people would n't believe me and would label me a liar '			1
she told her mother to forget what had happened and for three years continued to live in fear of meeting her abuser again			0
in 2011 , miss @entity1 gave birth to her daughter @entity111			2
years of trauma : after the first incident , ms @entity1 says the sexual abuse became regular and would happen when no one was around to protect her she continued : ' as soon as i held her i felt an overwhelming rush of love			1
i knew i could n't let him abuse any more innocent children			2
' she went to the police station in @entity35 and officers took her statement			0

' she suffered depression and anxiety in her early teenage years before finally opening up about the ordeal to boyfriend , @entity112 ( pictured together right ) , at the age of 15 in 2011 @entity3 was arrested but it was not until july 2013 that the case went to court			1

' in court he looked weak and pathetic as he fought to avoid my gaze , ' miss @entity1 said			2
' in that moment i realised , i was no longer scared of him			0
he was a monster , who 'd taken advantage of an innocent young girl			0
' i 'm now working to put the past behind me , and i 'm focusing on my future			0
my rapist may have stolen my childhood , but he ca n't take away my future			0
' detective sergeant @entity190 , from @entity191 , said : ' although these offences were committed a long time ago , the victims have had to live with the effects ever since			0
' this was a particularly complex case because of the historic nature of the offences , the fact that there were multiple victims , and the fact that they were so young at the time			0
' that led to difficulties in obtaining detailed , and accurate , accounts from the victims			0
but the result is a testament to the courage , and strength , of the two victims , and many witnesses			2
' it has undoubtedly removed a very dangerous man from the streets of @entity36			0
