by @entity0 defiant : environment secretary @entity1 insists we will fall behind in farming technology if we outlaw @entity5 techniques @entity1 yesterday launched a stinging attack on those who are concerned about the dangers of genetically - modified food			1
the environment secretary accused those opposed to the development of gm foods as being ‘ politically - motivated ’ and said blocking the technology risked making the @entity17 a ‘ museum of farming ’			1
critics say that tampering with the genes in crops to create ‘ frankenstein foods ’ could damage natural ecosystems or even affect human health			1
but this month @entity25 politicians are expected to approve the licensing of the first commercial food crop in 15 years using the controversial technology			1
mr @entity1 will vote to approve the crop - an insect - resistant maize developed jointly by @entity31 and @entity32 - at a meeting of the @entity34			1
and yesterday the environment secretary , speaking at the @entity35 , said : ‘ if approval is granted , as it should be based on the scientific evidence , then it will be the first @entity5 food crop authorised for planting by the @entity25 for 15 years			1
‘ whether or not this vote heralds a breakthrough in the @entity25 ’s regulation of @entity5 crops remains to be seen			1
‘ delays and blockages have been politically - motivated rather than based on evidence			0
’ he added : ‘ i will continue to make the case for a regime that allows fair market access for products once they have passed @entity54 ’s rigorous , independent scientific assessment			0
‘ let me be clear , there are other tools in the toolbox , @entity5 is not a panacea			1
but the longer that @entity54 continues to close its doors to @entity5 , the greater the risk that the rest of the world will bypass us altogether			1
‘ @entity54 risks becoming the @entity65 as innovative companies make decisions to invest and develop new technologies in other markets			0
’ last night @entity71 campaigners responded with fury to mr @entity1 ’s claims - and said he was ignoring decades of research that shows the scientific argument for meddling with nature has not yet been won			0
@entity77 , policy director of organic farming group the @entity78 , said : ‘ the accusation that opposition to @entity5 is “ political ” is simply a politician ’s way of sidestepping the overwhelming scientific , safety and market arguments against @entity5 backlash : critics attacked @entity1 for ' ignoring decades of research ' that shows it is bad to meddle with nature ‘ the fact is that no tests are done to check whether @entity5 food is safe for people to eat			1
‘ not a single @entity17 supermarket has said they will buy @entity5 crops and sell them , and @entity17 consumers remain just as opposed to @entity5 food as ever			1
‘ @entity99 , the @entity100 and @entity54 regulators do or do not decide about particular @entity5 crops is neither here nor there			2
‘ farmers do n’t grow what @entity1 tells them to grow , and @entity1 does n’t buy what they do grow			0
’ @entity109 food campaigner @entity108 added : ‘ despite decades of research , evidence shows there are still no miracle crops to tackle important issues agriculture faces , such as climate change , soil degradation , water shortages and meeting growing demand			0
@entity121 , president of the @entity122 , said scientists were fleeing to @entity124 due to over-regulation ‘ our farming system certainly needs to change , but this should focus on less - intensive practices that increase agricultural diversity and benefit local people and the environment			2
’ innovations in gm technology were , however , backed by the @entity134			0
@entity122 president @entity121 warned that @entity54 scientists were fleeing to @entity124 because of over-regulation			0
he said : ‘ they do not believe we are ever going to adopt this technology			0
we have got to make decisions based on science and not on politics			0
‘ boy , have we got to make decisions if we want @entity54 agriculture to be globally competitive and not start with the premise that we are going to protect artisan agriculture at all costs			0
’ he said he was concerned that debate about @entity5 was dominated by ‘ myth and scare and no science whatsoever ’ and added : ‘ we have got to put science in the decision making and reduce the politics			2
’ if approved , the new crop would be the second @entity5 food product to be grown in the @entity25 after @entity157 won approval for another insect - resistant corn variety in 1998			1
the crop is unlikely to be grown in @entity17 because the insects it has been bred to resist do not live in the country			0
@entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 are among countries expected to oppose approval , while supporters are likely to include @entity17 , @entity169 and @entity170			0
by comparison , @entity5 crops are grown widely in the @entity173 and parts of @entity175			2
mr @entity1 faces an uphill struggle convincing the @entity17 public of @entity5 benefits			2
a recent survey by the @entity180 found two out of three @entity17 shoppers wanted products from animals fed a @entity5 diet to be labelled .			2

critics say playing with genes in ' frankenstein food ' damages ecosystem
but environment secretary *blasted* notion as old - *fashioned*
comes as @entity25 expected to approve licensing of first @entity5 crop in 15 years
