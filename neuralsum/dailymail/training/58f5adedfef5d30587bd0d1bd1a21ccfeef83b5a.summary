rant : @entity1 had an unseemly @entity3 spat with a reporter the @entity5 launched an astonishing attack on its critics yesterday , accusing them of being crazy , lazy , cynical and shoddy			1
a senior executive lashed out at those who dared to criticise the corporation ’s huge salaries or to point out that the @entity13 schedule was stuffed with repeats			1
@entity1 , who earns £ 327,800 as director of television , had an unseemly @entity3 spat with a reporter who questioned why 62 per cent of the festive output on @entity19 and @entity20 will be old shows			1
at the same time , the @entity5 ’s communications department attacked @entity23 after it questioned executive salaries and whether licence fee payers are getting value for money			1
speaking at a preview of the @entity5 ’s festive line - up , mr @entity1 called for opponents of the @entity5 to tone down their criticism			1
‘ perhaps this is time for a little less of the critical friend and a bit more of the friend , ’ he said			0
‘ it would be crazy to damage , undermine or deflate what we have done			1
’ mr @entity1 accepted that the @entity5 ‘ does n’t get everything right ’ and should be held to account			1
however , he raised eyebrows with his assertion that the @entity5 should be treated like a ‘ company ’			0
‘ we must avoid undermining this success story , this growth of the @entity47 creative industries , this reputational dividend for @entity47 plc , ’ he said			0
question posed : @entity51 have asked @entity53 leader @entity52 for a parliamentary debate on whether the @entity5 was meeting its public obligations ‘ the @entity5 is a great @entity47 company , not a government department			2
we need it to flourish and continue to be the spark that lights a thousand creative fires			0
’ mr @entity1 ’s tone became angrier when he took to @entity3 after the event and attacked individual journalists for criticising the @entity5			1
@entity62 is waging war with its critics on social media – tweeting a line - by - line refutation of two scathing editorials published in a newspaper			0
the editorials were critical of executive salaries , but as part of its aggressive new pr strategy the corporation ’s communications department attempted to debunk the claims			2
challenging @entity23 ’s assertion that ‘ nothing has changed ’ at the top , it said the number of senior managers and the associated pay bill had been driven down by ‘ over a third ’			2
however , it neglected to address the fact that the number of managers in the tier below , where the average wage is now £ 77,308 , has risen from 638 to 729			2
it responded to questions over whether it was worth the licence fee by saying : ‘ at just £ 2.80 a week per household the @entity5 provides excellent value for money			2
’ a string of newspapers , including the @entity97 , held the corporation to account for filling much of its @entity100 schedule with old shows			0
but mr @entity1 dismissed the reports as ‘ poor journalism ’ and ‘ standard , lazy , annually repeated newspaper stories about the @entity5 ’			1
he added : ‘ the real story is the amazing talent on the @entity5 that week			0
’ however , despite the strength of his language , mr @entity1 was unable to dispute the fact that @entity100 repeats have soared in recent years			1
@entity20 is the worst offender , with repeats accounting for 74 per cent of its programming			0
overall , the number of repeats shown across @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity119 and @entity120 is believed to be the highest ever for the @entity100 period			0
the disclosure prompted mps to ask commons leader @entity52 for a parliamentary debate on whether the @entity5 was meeting its public obligations			0
conservative backbencher @entity126 said : ‘ could we please have a debate on the @entity5 getting back to its remit and charter on public broadcasting instead of lazily repeating more often than a hearty @entity100 dinner ? ’ mr @entity52 refused the request but added : ‘ i ’m sure – well , i hope – they will be listening to what you say in the @entity5			0
