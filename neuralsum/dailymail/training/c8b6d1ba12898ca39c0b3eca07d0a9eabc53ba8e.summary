by @entity0 published : 09:27 est , 18 july 2012 updated : 09:02 est , 19 july 2012 record numbers of pensioners are working , but the number of young people searching for a job for more than six months has also hit an all - time high , official figures revealed yesterday			1
the figures highlight the problems facing @entity10 ’s troubled labour market as pensioners are forced to keep on working because of a lack of money , but young people can not find work			1
nearly one million pensioners have jobs , but nearly 500,000 under - 24s want one but can not find one , according to the @entity18			2
good and bad : despite a drop in unemployment the numbers claiming jobseeker 's allowance is up , particularly among women @entity25 , from the @entity24 , said : ‘ a lot of our members are keen that their grandchildren can get a job			1
‘ they think the young deserve a chance , but they worry they are not going to get one			0
‘ as the state pension age rises , we will be making the old work for longer but keeping the young on unemployment benefits , which is a ridiculous way to do things			2
’ the @entity18 said there were 929,000 over- 65s working , the largest number since records began 20 years ago			2
between march and may , an extra 565 people every day joined @entity10 ’s army of older workers as baby boomers , born after the end of the @entity46 , realised they did not want – or could not afford – to stop work			2
but the @entity18 figures highlight chronic problems at the other end of the age spectrum			0
the number of young people between the age of 16 and 24 who have been looking for a job for more than six months has jumped by 30 per cent over the past year			1
@entity58 , in the past quarter it has fallen 10,000 on the quarter			0
of those , the number of young people out of education and seeking work is now 724,000 and the number of full time students looking for a job is 299,000			1
@entity67 boost : @entity69 jobs market shows an improvement ahead of the @entity71 that has helped boost unemployment figures released today in total , 489,000 young people have fallen into this trap which is also the highest number since records began in 1992			1
@entity77 , director of the youth charity @entity78 , said : ‘ there are now more long - term unemployed young people in the @entity10 than ever before , with hundreds of thousands feeling they will spend their lives on the scrapheap			1
‘ we need to focus on supporting the most vulnerable young people , who are being pushed to the back of the dole queue			0
‘ if we invest in young people now , we can save the state billions in benefits and lost productivity			0
’ the figures come after the government scrapped the default retirement age last year which means bosses can no longer kick out a worker simply because they have reached 65			0
as the state pension age is increased , the trend of people working beyond the age of 65 will continue			0
the state pension age will reach 67 in 2028 , and will continue to rise			0
evidence from @entity101 , which raised its state pension age from 62 to 65 for women in 1993 , proves that it triggers problems for young people			1
research from the @entity107 concluded : ‘ firms hire approximately one fewer worker for each older worker that is retained due to the higher mandatory retirement age			0
‘ we also find that younger workers and , in particular , younger women are the demographic groups most affected by the lower level of total hirings			0
’ overall , ministers yesterday welcomed a drop in unemployment , which fell by 65,000 between march and may to 2.58million			1
but economists said the figure was skewed by a large drop in @entity69 after a hiring spree triggered by temporary events such as the @entity67 and the @entity127 celebrations			1
secretary of state for work and pensions @entity128 said : ' the previous @entity92 ’s approach to employment programmes meant young people were put onto schemes that took them off the unemployment register , but when they left the schemes many went straight back onto benefits			1
' resetting the clock so that young people were n’t counted as long - term unemployed did n't help them get a job - they were still unemployed whatever the official statistics said			2
' we have stopped this nonsense and it is only @entity142 who persists with the notion that these young people were in jobs			0
' we have challenged the opposition to come clean and stop playing fast and loose with the facts , but no one will be surprised that they have n't responded			0

unemployment down to 2.58m - lowest since almost 12 months
but overall number of people , especially women , claiming jobseeker 's allowance is up
@entity92 says figures show economy is taking step in the right direction
@entity69 sees biggest drop in unemployment - mainly because of the @entity67
