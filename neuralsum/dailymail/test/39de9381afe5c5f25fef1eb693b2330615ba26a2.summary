@entity0 has proclaimed that he will ' smash apart ' @entity2 's ' one - party state ' in the @entity3 at the election			1
the @entity6 leader said that his party is now the ' serious challenger ' to @entity2 in northern seats			1
he accused the party of making claims @entity6 is racist because it is ' running scared '			1
‎ mr @entity0 called on @entity14 supporters to vote tactically to help @entity6 beat @entity2 in its target seats			1
in an article for @entity25 , he wrote : ' the truth is , @entity2 are running scared , and it 's not the @entity14 making great inroads into their vote			1
' you only have to look at last year 's @entity29 by - election for proof of it			0
' we came within 620 votes of taking a " safe " @entity2 seat , and actually , mr @entity22 would have had to resign as leader of his party if we had done it			2
the problem in that case was that the @entity14 split the vote			0
' mr @entity0 accused @entity2 of ' sneering ' at people who raised issues about immigration and claimed @entity6 has now ' emerged as the party of the working man '			1
he added : ' across the @entity3 , @entity6 are now the serious challengers to @entity2			1
' mr @entity0 accused @entity2 's shadow business secretary @entity47 of making ' tired and old claims ' after he said at the weekend that @entity6 is infected with the ' virus of racism '			1
he wrote : ' while most people pay no heed when they hear these claims nowadays , it is interesting to think about why @entity2 chiefs are attacking @entity6 , when they really should be focusing on mr @entity57 's conservatives by this point in the campaign			1
' mr @entity0 will on tuesday campaign in @entity61 , where he thinks the party has its best chance of winning in the @entity64 at the election			2
the seat has been put on @entity6 's list of top ten targets			1
other seats outside of the south of @entity71 on the list are @entity73 , @entity74 & @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			0
proud : @entity6 's strategists believe the party could come second in at least 100 seats in the @entity3 however , the party suffered a blow on monday when a poll by @entity14 peer lord @entity84 showed the party was 17 points behind @entity2 in @entity73			1
@entity6 's strategists believe the party could come second in at least 100 seats in the @entity3			1
in 2010 the party failed to achieve even a single second place			0
the @entity61 constituency has been held by @entity2 since it was formed in 1974			0
in 2010 , @entity6 took just seven per cent of the vote and @entity2 's @entity92 retained the seat with a 5,509 majority			1
he replaced @entity95 as the mp in a by - election in 2004 after the @entity2 grandee stood down to become a @entity100 commissioner			0
mr @entity0 's hopes for electoral victory in @entity61 come after the town elected a man dressed as a monkey as its mayor in 2002			2
@entity107 stood as ' @entity108 ' , @entity110 's mascot , as a publicity stunt with the slogan , ' free bananas for schoolchildren '			0
he was re-elected in 2005 and 2009 before voters in the town backed a referendum to scrap the paid post in 2012			0
@entity61 's residents are famously said to have hanged a monkey during the napoleonic wars because they thought it was a @entity123 spy			0
‎ have you noticed how in the past few days @entity2 has started to attack me and @entity6 , just as the polls suggest that more and more @entity2 voters are going to be voting for us on may 7th ? polls have shown a sharply rising proportion of @entity6 supporters drawn from people who voted @entity2 in 2010			1
on april 17th it was seven per cent			0
this weekend it jumped to 19 percent			0
@entity2 's @entity47 has again repeated a tired old claim about @entity6 and race			1
worried : mr @entity0 said @entity2 are ' running scared ' of his @entity6 while most people pay no heed when they hear these claims nowadays , it is interesting to think about why @entity2 chiefs are attacking @entity6 , when they really should be focusing on mr @entity57 's conservatives by this point in the campaign			1
the truth is , @entity2 are running scared , and it 's not the @entity14 making great inroads into their vote			1
you only have to look at last year 's @entity29 by - election for proof of it			0
we came within 620 votes of taking a ' safe ' @entity2 seat , and actually , mr @entity22 would have had to resign as leader of his party if we had done it			2
the problem in that case was that the @entity14 split the vote , and we had n't yet proclaimed our @entity158 - style points system plan for immigration , or our plans to take those on the minimum wage out of income tax completely			0
sneering : mr @entity0 said @entity47 continued to ' sneer ' at his party on immigration and attacked a ' whopping majority of @entity168 ' and far from the party of old , gin - soaked half colonels that some would like @entity6 to be , we have emerged as the party of the working man and woman of this country , with a health policy welcomed by the @entity177 , a housing policy endorsed by the @entity179 , and an immigration policy that 77 per cent of the @entity168 public agree with			1
but mr @entity47 and the @entity182 continue to sneer at people over the issues they want answers on			1
when they attack me , they 're really attacking a whopping majority of @entity168 who know that on defence , our @entity191 , jobs , and the economy , @entity2 has proved itself to be grossly negligent			0
on immigration , @entity2 was wilfully deceitful , as several senior party sources now admit			2
they wanted to change our communities for political gain			0
they simply do not understand the impact that mass migration has had on people 's lives			0
in doing what they did , they betrayed their core voters – keeping wages down , making it harder to get a @entity211 appointment , and creating a shortage of school places			0
people rely on government to help them with some of their most basic needs , and @entity2 has not just failed to provide them , it has actually reduced their availability			2
look at the mess @entity22 's party is in as a result of all this			0
across the @entity3 , @entity6 are now the serious challengers to @entity2			1
in @entity225 , @entity2 's heading for a wipeout			2
people are mustering up the courage to depart from their ' traditional ' way of voting			0
they want to send @entity2 a message : ' you do n't represent us anymore '			0
that 's because in areas like @entity237 , @entity61 , and @entity238 , @entity2 has ceased trying to represent the values , beliefs and opinions of ordinary folk			2
they 're more concerned with the chattering classes of @entity245 and @entity246			0
and let 's face it , until a few years ago there was n't much choice in the @entity3			2
the @entity14 's entire campaign is based on the idea that he economy is enriching people 's lives , but very few people in the @entity3 are feeling that			2
and their claims expose the fact that they do n't know how much people are still struggling			0
but now there 's a challenger in the @entity3			2
so expect , over the next few days , a panicked campaign by @entity22 and chums during which they 'll call us names , hurl abuse , and try and scare voters away from us			0
instead , trust in your judgement , and help us smash apart @entity2 's one party state in the @entity3			1
@entity6 has several target seats in the @entity3 , which i now believe we 're in with a chance of winning			1
