olympic champion @entity11 did not defend his title and @entity4 and pony - tailed teen @entity9 failed to sparkle in the @entity14 , to leave the @entity5 off the men 's podium for the first time since the 1998 @entity18			1
@entity9 , 19 , finished ninth and 28 - year - old @entity4 12th , although both got bronze with the @entity5 in the new team event			1
oops : @entity4 falls after failing to complete a jump in the men 's @entity24 on thursday smack : @entity4 , who has already won a bronze in the group event , smashed onto the ice during the trick ' i just want to put my middle finger in the air and say a big ' @entity40 - you ' to everyone who has ever said that to me because they 've never stood in my shoes and they 've never had to do what i 've had to do , ' said @entity4 , who will be remembered more for spectacular tumbles in @entity41			1
@entity4 opened the team challenge on the first day of competition with an error - strewn short programme and things did n't get better for him in the individual event			1
the skater from @entity49 , @entity47 suffered a nasty fall attempting a quad jump in the short programme			2
he lay in pain for ten seconds as the music continued to play , before pulling himself up , rubbing his hip and gliding back into the centre of the ice to finish and qualify in 15h place for the free skate final			2
crash landing : @entity4 slides across the ice after his spectacular fall with a grimace of pain on his face smash : the 28 - year - old crashed into the boards and grabbed his hip while howling in pain ' nobody has to stand centre ice in front of a million people and put an entire career on the line for eight minutes of their life when they 've been doing it for 20 - some years , ' he said , after placing eighth in the free skate for an overall 12th position between the two programmes			1
' and if you think that that 's not hard , then you 're a damn idiot			0
' i 'm proud to be standing here			0
i 'm a four - time national champion			0
i 'm a two - time olympian and no one can take that away from me			0
' so some people can handle it better than others , but everyone has that mental struggle , everyone goes through the same doubts			0
they just come at different times and different moments			0
some people have their moment at the @entity99 , and some have theirs at the national championships			0
' ' so whatever other people have to say about me , that 's their own problem because i 'm freaking proud of what i 've done and i 'm not going to apologize for any of it			2
' he 's up ! @entity4 limps away from the boards - his face creased with pain - but he is determined to carry on fighter : both @entity113 and @entity5 spectators broke into applause as @entity4 finished up his routine thankful : @entity4 acknowledges the crowd with a bouquet of flowers following the men 's short program teammate @entity9 missed a chance of a podium spot , as he dropped from sixth in the short programme to 11th in the free skate for an overall ninth - place finish			1
' i was hoping for a top 10 , and i did that , and i got a bronze in the team event			0
hopefully in the future , i 'll get one in the ( men 's )			2

@entity4 , 28 , attempted a *quadruple* jump in the men 's short program on thursday but instead fell flat on his face
he slid to the boards and grabbed his side in pain - before pulling himself to his feet and finishing the rest of the routine *flawlessly*
he says people who have n't skated in his boots before millions of people should keep their opinions to themselves
