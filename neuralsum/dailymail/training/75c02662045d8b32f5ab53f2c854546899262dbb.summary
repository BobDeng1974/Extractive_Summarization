@entity1 boss @entity0 has expressed his surprise at being able to land @entity4 midfielder @entity3 on loan until the end of the season			1
@entity3 was one of four deadline day signings by the @entity10 along with record signing @entity11 , @entity13 and @entity14			1
his departure has caused some consternation on @entity17 with former @entity19 @entity18 describing the club 's decision as ' a big gamble '			0
@entity0 told his club 's official website : ' i 've been monitoring @entity3 for a couple of weeks and we quietly made it happen			1
' i did n't think it would be possible to do a loan deal , but the later it got the more beneficial it became			2
with a bit of patience and luck , we 've managed to pull in a really good player			0
' we all know he is a wonderful talent and although it has gone a little bit sideways for him at @entity4 in the last couple of months , he 'll bring that little bit of flair and creativity that every team needs			2
' out of favour : @entity3 had been exiled to the reserves by @entity61 at @entity4 dismay : @entity4 supporters unfurled a banner of @entity3 during the draw against @entity65 despite a promising start to his @entity4 career @entity3 fell out of favour with boss @entity61 and was left out of the club 's long - haul pre-season tour			1
inconsistency and a perceived lack of effort saw him banished to the reserves but some @entity4 supporters are clearly unhappy over the @entity77 's departure			1
his compatriot @entity18 told the @entity79 : ' it 's a big gamble			0
it 's also a big statement from @entity61 that he does not believe in @entity82			0
' the only problem is , it seems he is the only one who does n't believe in him			0
the big issue is that @entity4 wo n't look very good if he starts to perform the way @entity89 can in a @entity1 shirt			0
' @entity0 could be forgiven a sigh of relief over his deadline day dealings after suffering the departure of @entity96 and a long - term injury to new signing @entity98 on the opening day of the season			1
reach for the sky : @entity0 was delighted with his signings on deadline day and the @entity10 boss paid tribute to those at that club who helped facilitate what he described as a day of ' fantastic business '			1
@entity0 added : ' when we were having discussions about the sale of @entity96 a few weeks ago , they said it was n't a problem to reinvest the money we received			2
' they 've proved that again with what we 've been able to do in this transfer window			0
now it 's up to me to make sure that the players gel together and get us up and running			0

@entity0 *admits* he did n't think a loan deal was possible on deadline day
' he will bring the creativity every team needs '
@entity3 has a year left on his @entity4 contract , but fell out with manager @entity61
@entity135 he was able to spend *Â£* *12m* from @entity96 's departure
