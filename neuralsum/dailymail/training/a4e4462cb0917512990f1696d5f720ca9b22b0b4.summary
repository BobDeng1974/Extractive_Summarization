the stabbing of @entity1 in front of her pupils triggered a national debate over security in our schools last night			1
head teachers demanded stronger backing for schools which choose to introduce airport - style metal detectors and frisk pupils for weapons			1
but they said schools must not be ‘ locked down ’ in the wake of the incident			2
staff have repeatedly voiced concern over the risk of violent attacks on school premises			1
last week , police disclosed that nearly 1,000 children – 80 of them primary pupils – have been caught taking weapons into school in three years			1
a survey of teachers found that more than half have been subjected to verbal abuse or threats from pupils			2
children are being instilled with a ‘ blame someone else ’ culture at home and also believe they can treat teachers ‘ like servants ’ , the @entity47 report claimed			2
schools have been granted powers to frisk pupils for weapons and a range of contraband by patting down their clothing			1
they can also screen whole groups with security arches or wands			0
stabbed : @entity1 , 61 , was pronounced dead at a hospital after attempts to save her life failed the teacher was approached by the alleged attacker and stabbed repeatedly in the neck at the school in @entity72 , @entity73 but head teachers warned last night that many staff remain reluctant to conduct the searches			1
@entity77 , general secretary of the @entity78 , said : ‘ people are not necessarily comfortable with the powers			0
what i think is right is that this is taken on a school - by - school basis			2
‘ where there are tensions in a particular school that school could take the choice , for example , to exclude a pupil or to install metal detectors			1
schools need to be confident in exercising their powers and know they will be backed by the local authority			2
‘ a school has to set boundaries and be that place in the community where a pupil knows they will be safe			0
’ but he stressed : ‘ we do n’t want to lock down all schools where there are no problems or risks			0
schools should be open to the community unless you have got particular reasons to suspect there might be issues			0
’ @entity112 , @entity113 mp for @entity114 , described the incident as ‘ profoundly saddening ’			0
but he added : ‘ schools are places of learning			0
we want our schools to be open – we do n’t want to lock pupils and staff behind high fences			1
’ ' you was the best teacher ' : two tributes left at the school - both of which describe mrs @entity1 as ' caring ' gathering : the local community attend @entity127 to pay their respects to mrs @entity1 memory : flower tributes were left outside the school , pictured , with one card from a pupil reading : ' a special teacher			1
we was all sad about it			0
rip i will never forget you ' in 2008 , the @entity139 announced plans for airport - style metal detectors in hundreds of schools			1
the following year , the east @entity28 borough of @entity145 became the first to announce that detectors would be used at its 22 secondary schools			1
guidance from the @entity150 says pupils can be made to pass through a metal detector even if there is no suspicion they have a weapon			2
if they refuse , they can be barred			0
schools are also increasingly installing cctv and drafting in police officers to patrol corridors and classrooms			0
campaigners say such measures can unfairly ‘ criminalise ’ youngsters			0
professor @entity164 of the @entity165 warned this month that pupils in @entity32 were among the worst - behaved in the developed world			1
the government and @entity169 ‘ seriously underestimate ’ the scale of classroom indiscipline , he said			0
