@entity0 had her first car - a @entity3 - stolen from the parking lot of her work six months after she bought it in @entity6 , @entity7 , in 1972			1
at the time police said the car was a likely stripped of its parts and dumped in the @entity11			0
but the cops recently called her saying it had been found , 42 years after it was taken from her			0
the only problem is that she no longer actually owns it			0
finally found : this @entity3 was stolen from its owner in 1972 , but has now turned up , thanks to the smarts of a car restorer who recently bought it well - kept : the car is in exceptional condition , the only problem is that the original owner no longer owns it impounded : owner @entity27 now needs a court order to get her car back after 42 years the new owner , car restorer @entity31 , bought it from a widow in @entity35			1
@entity31 checked the vehicle identification number ( @entity37 ) and realized it matched a 1969 @entity3 convertible and thought something was amiss			1
he the realized there was another @entity37 stamped into the frame and engine			2
@entity31 called police , who verified the car was stolen in november 1972			2
the car was impounded and @entity27 was told it had been found , all these years later			2
however , @entity27 had financed and insured the car through @entity49 , who paid out the title when it was stolen			1
that gave @entity49 legal ownership of the car			0
now , neither @entity49 nor the state of @entity7 can provide a title to @entity27			1
' if i could get that car back , it could roll back up the same driveway , pull back into the same carport it left 11 - 14 - 72			1
how awesome is that ? ' @entity27 told @entity63			2
great condition : the car was looked after very well by its former owner slick : interestingly , owner @entity27 lives in the same place she did when the car was stolen reunion : @entity27 hopes the car will finally be returned to her after all this time flashback : this is a photo of @entity27 taken around the time the car was stolen in 1972 @entity27 now needs a court order in order to get the car released to her			1
however she says she ca n't afford to get one			0
without a court order the car will stay impounded and eventually be auctioned off			0
' if i can not have the car back , i do not want to see it , ' @entity27 told @entity63			1
' and i will have to get over ( losing it ) all again			0
' hot rod : unless a court order allows her car be released , it â€™ll head off to police auction for the highest bidder			0
