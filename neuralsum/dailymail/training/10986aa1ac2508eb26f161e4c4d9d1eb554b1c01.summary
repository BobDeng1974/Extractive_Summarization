by @entity1 reporter flats have increased in value more than any other property type over the past decade , with a typical rise of £ 394 per month , a study has found			0
terraced houses are the second - best performers , while detached homes have seen the smallest percentage increase in their prices , according to @entity12			1
using its own database , @entity12 said flat prices had risen by more than a third ( 35 per cent ) on average since 2003 , putting them just ahead of terraced homes ( 32 per cent )			1
spiral : the average price for a flat , the @entity21 's most popular home , has gone up by 35 per cent in just ten years flats are worth almost £ 47,500 more than they were a decade ago , with a typical price tag of £ 180,799			1
@entity12 put much of the rise down to the strength of the @entity28 market , which has a high proportion of flats			0
but flats in @entity32 have seen the biggest percentage increase in value of anywhere in @entity21 over the past decade , with a 57 per cent upturn			1
@entity28 flats have increased in value by 37 per cent , but at more than £ 286,000 , the average price of a flat in the capital is more than double that of a flat in @entity32 ( £ 121,000 )			1
starter home : the average price of a flat in @entity28 has reached £ 286,000 , 37 per cent more than 10 years ago @entity12 said price growth for detached homes , semi-detached properties and bungalows had been constrained in recent years by a lack of home movers			1
flats and terraced homes tend to be particularly popular with first - time buyers , who have recently returned to their market in their strongest numbers since the economic downturn			1
the rise has been attributed to the launch of a string of @entity62 measures to improve mortgage availability , such as @entity64 and help to buy			0
property search website @entity66 reported last month that asking prices for flats had reached an all - time high			2
economist : @entity72 says larger properties are under performing in comparison with properties typically favoured by first - time buyers this , it said , was due to growing demand from first - time buyers coupled with high numbers of buy - to - let investors looking for decent returns as the rental market remains strong			2
in @entity86 , terraced homes have increased their value faster than any other property type , recording a 55 per cent rise over the last decade			0
the @entity90 and the @entity91 were the only regions where flats or terraces were not the best - performing property types			0
bungalows came out best in the @entity90 , where their value has risen by one third ( 33 per cent ) over the decade			0
semi-detached homes were the best - performers in the @entity91 , recording a 22 per cent rise in value over 10 years			0
the value of flats and terraced homes was particularly badly hit between 2007 - 09 , when banks tightened their borrowing criteria amid the economic troubles , making it tougher for first - time buyers to get a mortgage			2
during that period , the value of terraced houses and flats fell by around one third following a period of strong growth when low deposit mortgages had been more widely available			0
bungalows and detached homes were best at retaining their value in the couple of years following the price crash as they tend to be less reliant on the first - time buyer market			1
but @entity12 said that price growth for detached homes , semi-detached properties and bungalows has been constrained in recent years by a lack of home movers			1
detached homes recorded the smallest percentage increase in value over the last decade at 17 per cent , making them worth £ 286,175 on average			1
bungalows and semi-detached homes have seen their values increase by just under one quarter ( 24 per cent ) over the last 10 years			0
@entity72 , housing economist at @entity12 , said : ' during the recovery since 2009 larger property types such as detached homes , semis and bungalows have under - performed flats and terraces			2
' the demand for such properties has been partly constrained by a widespread lack of equity amongst home owners who bought for the first time around the peak in the market			0
' stagnant : detached homes , such as this £ 1.5million home in @entity28 , have increased at the slowest rate			2

flat prices have risen by 35 per cent since 2003 according to @entity12
the average price for a flat in the capital now comes in at £ 286,000
flats in @entity32 have seen the biggest percentage increase at 57 per cent
