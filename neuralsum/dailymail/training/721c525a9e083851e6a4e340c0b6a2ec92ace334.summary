by @entity0 published : 06:12 est , 14 december 2012 updated : 12:03 est , 14 december 2012 an abandoned dog so skinny you could see his ribcage has been rehomed in time for @entity5 after he was nursed back to health			1
the staffie - cross was found abandoned wandering the streets of @entity9 by the dog warden in the summer			1
he was taken to @entity14 weighing little more than 5kg , the weight of a healthy cat , and he was so thin horrified staff could easily count his ribs			2
starved : @entity16 was so this his ribs were clearly visible after he was left abandoned on the streets picture of health : but he now looks full of life after being nursed back to a normal weight by staff at @entity14 ' home but after months of dedicated care , 12 - month - old @entity25 has been nursed back to health and delighted kennel workers have managed to find him a new home just in time for the festive season			1
@entity25 , who now weighs a healthy 12.5kg , has happily settled into his new home with owner @entity33			1
@entity34 , who looked after @entity25 at the home , said : ' @entity25 was in a real state when he was brought to us - he was very nervous and so thin			1
' we think someone had just abandoned him on the street after deciding they did n't want him			2
' the poor thing was so think - it was heart - breaking			0
he was very nervous at first , but obviously a friendly dog , as it was n't long before his cheeky personality started to shine through			0
' he 's now back up to full health and has settled in really well with his new owner			1
' abandoned : @entity25 weighed the same as a cat when he was found wandering the streets of @entity9 visible : nurses at the dogs ' home were shocked at how they could see @entity25 's ribs when he first arrived @entity60 : staff at the kennel have been delighted with @entity25 's progress following months of care new owner @entity33 said : ' @entity25 is a lovely dog and i 'm so glad i 've been able to offer him a loving home			1
' he was so skinny when he was taken into the home , but fortunately , he 's happy and healthy now			0
new family member : owner @entity33 has said @entity25 is a ' lovely dog ' and is glad she had been able to rehome him ' he 's made himself a little bed on the sofa , and he loves snuggling up there			2
' the dogs ' home has been inundated with abandoned dogs , leading manager @entity82 to ask potential dog owners to think carefully before deciding to share their home with a dog			2
she said : ' our kennels are fit to bursting all year round , but especially at this time of year , i 'd ask people to really think before deciding to take on a dog			0
' a lot of people do n't research the cost involved , and just throw their pet out on the streets when they get bored with it			0
' there has been a notable decrease in the number of people coming to us to collect their dogs			0
' it used to be the case that about half of our dogs had gone missing , and people phoned around looking for them before coming to collect them from us - but in the last 12 months , fewer and fewer owners are coming to us to be reunited with their pets			0
' people even bring dogs into us with the most ludicrous reasons why they ca n't keep them - one woman told us she did n't expect the dog to bark , and several people have brought dogs to us saying they did n't realise their puppies would grow so big			0
' it 's great that @entity25 has found a home , and we hope that all our dogs will be as lucky as him			1
' commitment : the kennel has said it is inundated with dogs and warned people to think carefully before sharing deciding to get a new pet			0
