a @entity1 newspaper issued a correction to a headline it placed on a letter to the editor on february 6 : @entity6 is not the @entity7 , says the @entity8			1
what @entity9 wanted fellow readers to know is that the president is actually the @entity14 's biblical precursor -- or , as those with a working knowledge of the prophesied end days know him , the @entity18			1
along with the correction , the online version of the letter has been amended to read , ' is @entity6 the seventh king ? ' correction ! a @entity1 printed the headline ' is @entity6 the @entity7 ' on a letter to the editor february 6			1
the writer @entity9 actually meant that @entity6 is the precursor to the antichrist to his credit , @entity9 does ask that very question to open his 500 word letter			1
it seems that the @entity8 just miscounted kings			2
@entity9 writes : ' @entity35 states that seven kings must come before the rise of the @entity7			2
@entity38 17:10 says the seventh king will reign for a short amount of time			0
is @entity6 the seventh king ? ' he goes on to make the argument that @entity6 is , in fact , this @entity7 antecedent			1
' @entity6 claims nobody can stop him or change anything he 's done , ' @entity9 says			2
' this evil must come to pass before the @entity48 's return and the rise of the @entity7 , but you better know what evil you 're dealing with			2
' amended : the @entity8 ran the correction and also amended the online version of @entity9 's letter to read , ' is @entity6 the seventh king ? ' just who is the seventh king ? according to the @entity56 translation of @entity57 17 , he is one of those in power who aid the @entity7 in his bid to reign destruction down onto the @entity62			1
@entity63 , in part : and the dwellers on earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will marvel to see the beast , because it was and is not and is to come			0
this calls for a mind with wisdom : the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated ; they are also seven kings , five of whom have fallen , one is , the other has not yet come , and when he does come he must remain only a little while			0
as for the beast that was and is not , it is an eighth but it belongs to the seven , and it goes to destruction			0
and the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received royal power , but they are to receive authority as kings for one hour , together with the beast			0
these are of one mind , and they hand over their power and authority to the beast			0
they will make war on the @entity105 , and the @entity105 will conquer them , for he is lord of lords and king of kings , and those with him are called and chosen and faithful			0

the @entity8 called @entity6 the @entity7 in the headline of a letter to the editor -- its author wants you to know that 's no what he meant
@entity9 was , in fact , trying to convey that the president is the precursor to the antichrist
