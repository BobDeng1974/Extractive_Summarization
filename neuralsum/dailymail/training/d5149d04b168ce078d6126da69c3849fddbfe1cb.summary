savings have fallen to a record low as thousands of families fail to put away any money at the end of each month , figures show savings have fallen to a record low as thousands of families fail to put away any money at the end of each month , figures show			1
high house prices and poor wage growth has led to a dramatic fall in the amount that families are saving into pensions , bank accounts and investments			2
growing confidence in the economy has also deterred people from savings because they believe their job is secure and their home will grow in value			1
but experts warned that @entity25 faced a ' savings crisis ' and said many would be left in pension poverty			1
this year , total households will save just 5.4 per cent of their take - home pay â€“ the lowest percentage since records began 18 years ago			1
this is just half of the proportion saved in 2010 when households put away 11 per cent of their salary after tax , official figures show			2
by 2019 , this will have plunged further to 4.8 per cent , according to forecasts by the @entity40			0
the @entity41 ( @entity41 ) , which analysed the data , said @entity25 was in the middle of ' a lost decade ' of savings , which would not end until at least 2020			1
in 2010 , mass redundancies saw savings hit a 12 - year high as people squirrelled away their money amid fears they could lose their job			1
but since then , savings have fallen sharply as people increased their level of credit card debt and taken on larger mortgages			1
@entity56 prices have soared by double digits in many parts of the country , meaning many have large home loans , while below - inflation pay rises have compounded the problem			0
experts said last night that such poor savings risked leaving many with an inadequate income in retirement			0
@entity68 , at the @entity41 , told the @entity69 : ' people are spending more , rent and house prices have risen , but wages have stagnated			0
' we have had a consumption - driven recovery , with people buying more , but without the pay rises accompanying that			0
' this means many are struggling to put something away at the end of the month , so they are saving less money into their pension or bank accounts			1
' figures show that , on average , employees contributed just 2.9 per cent of their salary into a money purchase pension every month , while those in a gold - plated final salary pensions pay 5.9 per cent			1
experts warned that @entity25 faced a ' savings crisis ' and said many would be left in pension poverty ' for many , this is not enough for an adequate retirement income ' , mr @entity68 added			1
' we have a lost decade of savings which could turn into two or three decades			0
' if people do not start saving more , there will be a generation of people in their 20s , 30s and 40s who are significantly worse off in retirement than their parents			2
' @entity108 , of rate tracker website @entity109 , said workers were deterred from saving by record low interest rates			2
she said : ' people are looking at the rock - bottom rates and thinking it is not worthwhile to save			0
' she said there had been a shift away from saving in recent decades , adding : ' for many older generations , there was a savings culture and they were not as keen to get into debt			2
' now , people are in a lot of debt from a young age if they go to university , so they do not get into a habit of saving until much later			2
' the fall in savings is a ticking time bomb			0
' if people do not save now then what will they do when they reach retirement ? '			0

in 2012 , the government introduced new rules which forced bosses to pay into a pension for their employees			0
@entity143 said that auto - enrolment had helped to reverse a long - term decline in the number of people saving into a pension			1
he said : ' if you leave it to people [ to save themselves ] then it is n't go to happen , and that is the point of auto - enrolment			0
' but he said the drop in savings also symbolised increased confidence in the economy , saying : ' after the 2008 financial crash , people became quite risk adverse and savings went up quite dramatically			1
' now people feel more comfortable and , while they may be saving less , they might be looking at the rising value of their house as an asset			0
