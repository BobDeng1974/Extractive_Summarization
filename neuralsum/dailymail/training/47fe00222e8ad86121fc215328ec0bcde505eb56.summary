there has been a lot of media focus on cancer recently – with latest research suggesting the disease is down to bad luck rather than lifestyle			1
in actual fact , the study author was quick to point out that lifestyle still has a significant role to play in many cancers			0
personally , i believe that the better we look after ourselves , the luckier we get ! breast cancer is a good example			1
there is no doubt that breast cancer can run in the family			1
if you have the bad luck to inherit the genes that make you more likely to get breast cancer , there is not much you can do about it			1
dr @entity35 told @entity36 that breast cancer ( illustrated ) is a good example of how lifestyle can have a big impact on the disease in some cases those genes mean such a high risk of cancer that women choose to have mastectomies to avoid developing cancer later on , think @entity49			1
in other cases , your genes may only increase your risk slightly , but how you live your life also plays a part			2
so , with that in mind , i have put together some of the questions i am often asked about breast cancer			1
see how much you know about breast cancer risk and how you can reduce your chances of problems in the future … q : how much breast cancer is down to your genes ? a : only three in 100 cancers are due to definite gene problems – but having a close relative such as a mother or sister with breast cancer can double your risk			1
if you have a lot of relatives with breast ( or bowel ) cancer , particularly at a young age , it is especially important to mention this to your doctor , as it may be worthwhile getting your genetic risk assessed			2
q : how many women get breast cancer ? a : one in eight			1
it ’s the commonest form of cancer in women , and though most people are post-menopausal when they develop it , about a fifth of breast cancer sufferers are under 50			1
dr @entity93 outlines some of the questions patients regularly ask her about breast cancer q : if you have a breast lump , how likely is it to be cancer ? a : it ’s unlikely , i ’m pleased to say			1
breast lumps can be due to many things – general lumpiness around period time , cysts , infection or benign lumps called fibroadenomas			2
these lumps can get quite large and may , or may not be tender			0
benign breast lumps can be removed if necessary , but may often improve with little , if any treatment			2
however , any lump should be checked out by your doctor – particularly if it is hard and irregular , does n’t improve after your period , causes puckering of the skin or is associated with changes in the nipple			0
q : when are you eligible for breast cancer screening ? a : in the @entity128 , it ’s between 50 and 70 , but is being extended to cover women from 47 to 73			1
you can still ask to be screened after this age however			0
mammograms are x-rays that are frequently used to detect tiny abnormalities in breasts but are less good at finding problems in dense breasts			0
ultrasound or mri scans may also be used			0
q : how often should i check my breasts ? a : once a month			0
it is good to get into a regular habit and monthly checks mean that you will get to know what is normal for you so will be more confident in spotting any changes			0
avoid the time around a period when your breasts are naturally more lumpy			0
there are many guides on self - checking – but soapy hands in the shower are good for detecting lumps			2
a check in front of a mirror with hands raised above your head and then on hips can also help identify skin changes			0
one in eight women are diagnosed with breast cancer ( pictured under a microscope ) dr @entity93 told @entity36			1
it is the most common form of the disease in women , she added q : does being overweight increase the risk of breast cancer ? a : yes			1
fat is n’t just stuff that spills over your waistband and sends your weighing scales in the wrong direction – it is an organ of the body that produces chemical messengers ( hormones ) , one of which is oestrogen			0
oestrogen is thought to be a major part of the pathway leading to breast cancer so it follows that the more overweight you are , the greater your risk of breast cancer			1
touch can you feel a lump , either in the breast , upper chest or armpits ? is there a lumpy area , or an unusual thickening of the breast tissue that does n't go away ? is there any unusual pain , either in the breast or armpit ? 2			2
look any change in size or shape ? any change in skin texture ? such as puckering or dimpling any change in colour ? the breast may look red or inflamed what about the appearance or direction of the nipple ? any unusual discharge ? any rash or crusting ? 3			2
check is there anything unusual ? if so , get it checked out by your doctor as soon as possible			0
source : @entity232 however , being overweight can also decrease the number of periods you have ( which decreases the amount of oestrogen released from the ovaries )			0
this may explain the paradox that being overweight can actually decrease the risk of breast cancer before the menopause , but increases it after the menopause when fat is a more important source of oestrogen than the ovaries			1
q : how about alcohol and smoking ? a : yes , sorry			2
along with cutting down on food , we need to address all aspects of our lifestyle if we want to reduce our risk			2
we know that smoking is a major risk factor for lung cancer – but it can increase the risk of many other cancers too , including breast , cervix , stomach , mouth , bladder and ovary			1
too much alcohol – even just a little bit over recommended limits - has also been linked with breast cancer			1
just one extra unit per day can raise the risk by around 10 per cent			2
q : does @entity274 increase the risk of breast cancer ? a : sadly , yes			1
which means there is a downside to trying to reduce those hot flushes and other unwelcome consequences of the menopause			0
@entity274 contains the hormone oestrogen , and sometimes progesterone too , which can increase the risk of breast cancer			1
probably about four in 100 breast cancers can be linked to @entity274 , mainly those that contain both of the hormones			2
however , there is some ( though limited ) evidence that @entity274 can protect against other diseases such as osteoporosis and can certainly make the menopause bearable for women with severe symptoms – so whether or not to use it is a discussion worth having with your doctor			0
women are encouraged to check their own breasts for any changes each month q : do deodorants cause breast cancer ? a : we do n’t know for certain , is the short answer			1
some studies have suggested that there may be an increased risk due to the use of aluminium compounds in antiperspirants			0
these compounds temporarily block sweat glands – but can build up in breast tissue and produce some oestrogen - like effects			2
as we know , oestrogen can promote breast cancer growth and so there is a possible link			1
in contrast , other studies have not shown any increased risk			0
if the risk was very high , we would know about it by now so we should n’t be too alarmed			0
however , the increasing use of chemical products on ourselves , around the home and in our wider environment , is almost certainly causing some harmful effects and we should try to reduce them wherever possible			0
q : do underwired bras cause breast cancer ? a : no. this is a myth that has been started and perpetuated by some poor scientific studies that have since been robustly proven wrong			1
the theory was that over-tight bras could reduce the lymph drainage from the breast and therefore cause an accumulation of toxins that could then lead to cancer			2
there is no proof whatsoever that this occurs			0
conceivably , a wire rubbing against an already present breast lump could make you aware of it , hence the concern that the pressure may have caused it in the first place			0
but fear not , it ’s just coincidence , so you do n’t need to rush out and burn your bra			0
getting a good bra fitting is worthwhile , though			0
many women are wearing the wrong size and a well - fitted bra can give you an instant boost in body confidence , and take pressure off the shoulders for those with a heavier chest			2
in the @entity128 women aged between 50 and 70 are eligible for breast cancer screening			1
there are plans to extend the programme to cover women aged between 47 and 73 q : how common is breast cancer in men ? a : it ’s rare			1
only about 400 men a year get breast cancer – not surprising as they have very little breast tissue compared to women			1
the bad news is that it is more likely to have spread by the time it is picked up … probably because there is less awareness			0
it is more common in older men ( over 60 ) , men who have a family history of breast cancer , or men who are obese , so those man - boobs need tackling now			1
@entity395 is enlarged breast tissue ( as opposed to just fat ) that can appear as a lump behind the nipple but is non-cancerous and can be removed if needed			0
the message is that men need to be aware of breast lumps too and check them out with a doctor straight away			0
though breast cancer is common , and may be down to bad genes , there are things that you can do to reduce your risk … or to ensure you pick it up early			1
nearly all cancers can be treated – but the earlier they are detected , the greater the chance of success			0
treatment options have improved significantly over the past few decades – and now almost eight in 10 women diagnosed with breast cancer will still be alive 10 years later			1
so , do n’t leave it purely to chance – there is a lot you can do to improve your luck .			0

breast cancer does run in the family - if your mother or sister is diagnosed your risk of developing the disease doubles
one in eight women are diagnosed with the disease , dr @entity35 said
it is one of the most common forms of cancer in women but most patients are post-menopausal - around a fifth are under 50 at diagnosis
smoking , being obese and excess alcohol increase the risk of the disease
