by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 today faced calls to rein in his multi-billion mortgage guarantee scheme to only cover homes worth less than £ 260,000			1
the help to buy scheme risked creating ‘ distortions ’ without changes the head of the @entity11 economic think tank warned			1
critics have warned the scheme to make it easier for people to buy a home is helping to fuel demand , pushing up prices across the country by 10 per cent			2
under the £ 3.5billion equity loan scheme , introduced in april last year , first - time buyers and home movers can get help to buy a property worth up to £ 600,000			1
around 35,000 homes have been bought using it so far , amid claims @entity29 is not building enough houses to cope with rising demand			2
but @entity32 , the @entity11 's secretary general , has called for it to be more than halved to prevent a new property price bubble			0
he suggested cutting the threshold to the average house price of £ 262,000 before ‘ winding it down ’ altogether , the @entity35 reported			1
mr @entity32 said : ‘ it was a good idea and it worked			0
now the economy is back on track			0
the price of houses has gone double digit			0
‘ do you still really need the mechanism ? you need to think about moving towards normality before distortions set in			0
’ ‘ i would lower the cap			0
i 'd take it down to the average [ house price ]			2
’ @entity29 house prices rose by 10.5 per cent in the year to may , according to the @entity53			1
it includes a 20.1 per cent rise in @entity56 , although ministers insist the biggest beneficiaries of the help to buy scheme have been outside the capital			0
in may , house prices paid by first - time buyers were 11.3 per cent higher than a year earlier , compared to a 10.1 per cent increase for those already on the housing ladder			1
@entity67 insisted @entity68 remains behind help to buy for ' supporting responsible lending '			2
a spokesman said the average house price paid under the scheme is £ 190,000 compared to the @entity29 average of £ 262,000			1
' it is clearly helped first - time buyers and others to get on the property market , ' the spokesman added			1
the government is remaining vigilant about the scheme and the chancellor has asked the [ @entity84 's ] @entity83 to keep an eye on this			0

economic think tank says it is time to rein in the state - backed loan scheme
warns that changes are needed before it causes ' distortions ' in the market
house prices are up on average 10 *%* in a year in the @entity29 to £ 262,000
