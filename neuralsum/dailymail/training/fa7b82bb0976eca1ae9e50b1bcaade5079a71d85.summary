the leader of the @entity2 group on a local council who said an alleged rape victim was too ugly to be sexually assaulted has resigned from the party			2

' not sure anyone would want to even think about it looking at her lol , ' the senior local politician posted in response to a thread discussing miss @entity11 ' case			1
' offensive ' : @entity7 , left , shadow cabinet leader of @entity8 , said no one would want to rape fashion student @entity11 , right , who claimed she was sexually assaulted in @entity12 ' @entity21 ' : a grab from @entity10 shows the thread in which mr @entity7 made the comments mr @entity7 stepped down from his @entity2 position after a council investigation found no action should be taken against him because he was acting in a private capacity			1
maintaining he made the decision to stand down as a result of work pressures , he remains a councillor for @entity35 's @entity34 ward but now sits on the council as an independent			1
mr @entity7 put his comment , which was immediately slammed as ' awful ' and ' vile ' by others on @entity10 , down to tiredness following a business trip in @entity42			1
he was quoted as saying by @entity43 : ' i was excessively tired and was working nights			2
i had just come back from an excessive @entity42 business trip - i was tired			0
i will remain on the council			0
' that is all i want to say until i release a press release			0
' other @entity10 users reacted with fury , with one labelling mr @entity7 a ‘ pitiful excuse for a human being ’ and another saying they would not want to be represented by a councillor who made the comment			1
councillor @entity57 , @entity58 leader of @entity8 , said mr @entity7 ’s comment was regarded ‘ offensive '			1
he called the council ’s decision to allow him to stay ‘ deeply disappointing ’			0
' for the record and as you would expect , this council finds the crime of rape to be deeply deplorable not only because of the physical invasion but also the lasting psychological consequences , ' mr @entity57 said			0
' our only interest as a council would be to offer the victim all the sympathy and assistance possible			0
' although @entity77 has now exhausted its legal options , the @entity76 remains disappointed both with the actions of the councillor and also the effectiveness of the regulatory regime			1
' miss @entity83 in @entity84 : the second - year @entity86 student , who is hoping to join the @entity87 when she graduates , had been on a trip to the city as part of her fashion course when she said she was raped alleged rape victim @entity92 , 21 , who waived her right to anonymity , is now facing extradition and a possible 12 years in jail because @entity12 police believe she may have made up the incident			1
@entity99 asked police to open a case of slander against @entity83 after officers decided not to charge him following an investigation the second - year @entity86 student , who is hoping to join the @entity87 when she graduates , had been on a trip to @entity84 last may as part of her fashion course			2
she had visited the nightclub in the city 's @entity106 with a group of friends , and says she had started talking to @entity110 , 23 , inside			2
she claims that as the the pair were made their way to the vip area of the club , she was taken to the unisex toilet and attacked			2
the alleged assault was reported to police , and gave statements to officers , as well as being examined in hospital			0
@entity12 news reports from the time the allegations were made said police had watched @entity125 images which showed miss @entity11 leaving the bathroom together with mr @entity110 , who was employed by the nightclub			1
he faced no further action			2
he later lost his job with the club as a result of the allegation after bosses said ' having sex in the toilets is not what he is being paid for			0
' miss @entity11 returned to @entity86 and tried to put the trip behind her , until she was sent a letter from @entity12 police , which she took to a nearby police station to be translated			1
she expected to hear that her alleged attacker was to be prosecuted			0
instead she was served notice that she will go on trial for ‘ slander ’ against mr @entity110			0
under the @entity12 justice system if miss @entity11 is prosecuted she would not have to be present at the trial			1
if she were convicted she would be automatically entitled to two appeals			0
if she lost those appeals , judges could then start extradition proceedings although this is very unlikely as in @entity12 most sentences are suspended , except for very serious crimes .			0
