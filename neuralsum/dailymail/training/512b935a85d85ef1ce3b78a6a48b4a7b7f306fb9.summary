he did his job , not on his own , surrounded by opinions from top specialists in different areas , and the conclusion was the same as @entity81 's medical department had before the @entity83 , that the player has no problem			0
' after criticising his strikers last season , the @entity3 manager is pleased with the balance up front			2
' we have a guy in @entity20 who is a penalty - box expert , the best of the three in the air , ' he said			2
' @entity4 is fast , attacks spaces and can play from the sides			2
@entity19 is a player we were chasing for a year because he is a player for the style we want			2
we changed three for three and we believe these three give us more			0
' @entity20 , pictured reacting to a missed chance at @entity99 , has returned to @entity3 on a one - year deal @entity0 has praised the ability of @entity4 after signing him in a £ 10.5million deal from @entity10 @entity19 , who arrived at @entity103 from @entity104 this summer , celebrates scoring at @entity32 @entity0 applauded his club for selling @entity21 , @entity106 and @entity107 to fund moves for @entity19 , @entity4 , @entity109 and @entity110 , when @entity111 are scrutinising balance sheets for @entity113 ( @entity113 )			1
' we did our job in a good way , something that is fundamental for us , ' he said			0
' it 's not just a legal question			0
it 's also a pride question and that 's @entity113			1
it is something mr @entity123 is proud of			1
my club did it in a magnificent way with the income and the players we bought			2
' @entity19 , named on friday as the @entity24 's @entity131 , is back in training after a hamstring injury picked up on international duty with @entity135 but may be given extra time to rest ahead of wednesday 's @entity138 opener against @entity139			1
@entity0 allowed defender @entity106 to join @entity81 champions @entity140 for £ 50million earlier this summer @entity3 sold striker @entity107 ( right ) to @entity32 for £ 28million and have reinvested the money wisely @entity0 has not won the @entity142 for nearly eight years but was happy to concede defeat to @entity144 of @entity8 , who will be at @entity103 today			1
' i prefer my players to be players of the month , ' said the @entity3 boss			0
' last season some of them really deserved it and never got it and , this month , if it was n't @entity19 or @entity109 or @entity153 , i would be more disappointed			0
' finally we have a player of the month , which @entity19 deserved			0
the fact the decision went to the @entity8 manager for manager of the month is fair			0
