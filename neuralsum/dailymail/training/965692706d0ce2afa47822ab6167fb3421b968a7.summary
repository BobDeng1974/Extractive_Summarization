astronomers have found a planet which is one of the best candidates for life ever found by telescopes on @entity5			1
the planet is rocky , like ours , and orbits its sun within the ' habitable zone ' , where temperatures are just right for liquid water to exist on the planet 's surface			1
the temperature on the surface could be close to @entity5 's			0
' this planet is the new best candidate to support liquid water and , perhaps , life as we know it , ' study leader @entity16 said			1
the @entity23 scientists suggest that it 's likely that @entity5 is a one - off - and that life may not have evolved anywhere else one of the recent ' earth - like ' planets discovered by @entity28 - but a new @entity23 study suggests that @entity5 alone may play host to life the planet was detected using data from the @entity35 's telescopes , which was analysed to look for ' wobbles ' in a star 's motion caused the gravitational ' tug ' of planets orbiting it			1
the new planet has a mass around 4.5 times the @entity5 , and orbits a star called @entity46 , 22 light years from @entity5 - just next door , in galactic terms			1
the new planet absorbs around the same amount of light as our planet			0
' this was expected to be a rather unlikely star to host planets			0
yet there they are , around a very nearby , metal - poor example of the most common type of star in our galaxy , ' said @entity64 , a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at @entity67			1
' the planet is around one star in a triple - star system			2
the other stars are pretty far away , but they would look pretty nice in the sky			0
' ' the detection of this planet , this nearby and this soon , implies that our galaxy must be teeming with billions of potentially habitable rocky planets			2
' the @entity35 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 : the planet was detected using data from the @entity35 's telescopes , which was analysed to look for ' wobbles ' in a star 's motion caused the gravitational ' tug ' of planets orbiting it ' with the advent of a new generation of instruments , researchers will be able to survey many m dwarf stars for similar planets and eventually look for signatures of life in one of these worlds , ' said @entity16			1
the host star is a member of a system with three stars - the other two are orange dwarf planets			0
the star has a different chemical makeup than our @entity108 , with a much lower abundance of elements heavier than helium , such as iron , carbon , and silicon			0
this discovery indicates that potentially habitable planets can occur in a greater variety of environments than previously believed			0
@entity46 had previously been observed to have a large planet orbiting close to its star , although this finding was never published			2
this planet orbits so close to the star that it would be too hot for liquid water			1
the new study started with the aim of obtaining the orbital parameters of this super-earth.but in addition to this first candidate , the research team found the clear signal of the new planet ( @entity136			2
the team found that the system might also contain a gas - giant planet and an additional super-earth			0
however , further observations are needed to confirm these two possibilities .			0

planet orbits star 22 light years from @entity5
orbits sun at just the right *distance* for liquid water
@entity152 planet , like @entity5
' best new candidate to support liquid water - perhaps life ' says study leader
finding around common type of star : hints there could be billions of ' @entity5 - like ' worlds in our galaxy
