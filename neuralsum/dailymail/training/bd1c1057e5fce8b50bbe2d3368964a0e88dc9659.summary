by @entity0 published : 13:19 est , 29 april 2013 updated : 16:13 est , 29 april 2013 @entity2 star captain @entity1 insisted the cameras rolled as he lay dying , his sons reveal in a new book			2
for seven years the crab fisherman ’s public life of peril and brutality on the @entity10 consistently drew audiences of 3million			1
now , in an excoriating expose of their father @entity13 , 38 , and @entity15 , 27 , show the private reality of a man who could be ‘ as explosive as the seas he sailed on			1
instead he reared a worker a faithless husband and feckless father , riddled with addictions , @entity1 is shown to be a man unable to conquer his own demons and exploited at the very end			1
the crew continued to film as @entity1 underwent emergency brain surgery during which his skull was removed leaving part of his head concave : they were present as he went into cardiac arrest and had his chest split open as doctors carried out heart massage			2
only after , in the editing suite , were the scenes deemed too gruesome for air cut out			2
eight and a half million viewers tuned into watch when @entity1 ’s death aired , looking back @entity52 producer @entity51 admits : ‘ i ca n’t deny there was a degree of exploitation			1
’ @entity59 as she was when @entity1 fell for her - an exotic dancer at nightclub , @entity56 's , wearing a gold nugget necklace given to her by her soon - to - be husband but they were never going to let the @entity2 just slip away			1
it had proved the unexpected hit of the @entity52 when it first aired in 2005 , drawing an audience of 4 million without any promotion			2
the episode showing @entity1 ’s death was the third highest rated airing of any show in the network ’s history			1
it had been a lucky spot having only ever been intended as a twelve - minute segment in a two - hour special , ‘ @entity76			2
' and the phenomenal success was down to @entity1 – a different breed of man , according to show producer @entity80			2
he was a man with the deadliest job in the world and the deadliest lifestyle			2
in short , a man who lived high on borrowed time			2
@entity1 suffered a massive stroke while offloading crab in port at @entity90 , @entity91 , on 29 january 2010			2
he survived another month before dying in hospital of a pulmonary embolism at the age of 53			2
both @entity13 and @entity15 fished with their father on the ‘ @entity24			1
’ it was @entity13 who discovered his father following his stroke aboard the boat that made him famous			1
the once powerful man was contorted and twisted on the floor of his cabin , trapped under a hundred pound bench that had been bolted to the wall by the side of his bed			2
his last act of strength had been to rip that bench from its place			2
the man who had prided himself on his physical prowess after a lifetime spent at sea , in conditions few could endure , was paralysed down his left side			2
as he was strapped to a backboard and winched form his boat to the hospital bed that would prove his deathbed , producer @entity119 now admits he faced a moral and professional dilemma			2
' our cameras were there when they opened up his skull ... oh my @entity130 , it was so tough , ' @entity2 producer , @entity51 his film crew had spent several years with @entity1 , chronicling his exploits for the @entity2			0
the millions of followers would want to be with the man they had come to know and even admire			0
but , as @entity80 reflects : ‘ we were n’t just interlopers who were going to walk in and say , “ hey you ’re dying			0
can we film it ? ” ’ in the end it was @entity1 himself who took control , the last time he would do so			0
while the producers spoke with his sons and agonised over what to do and the star of the hit show lay dying , @entity1 gestured for paper and pen			0
he could n’t speak but he could write and so he did : ‘ you ’ve got to finish the story , ’ he wrote			0
‘ it needs an ending			0
’ lovers : @entity1 and @entity59 in the early days of the affair that led to the turbulent marriage that produced sons @entity15 and @entity13 feckless : @entity1 with infant son @entity13 but fatherhood could not curb his addictions to drink , drugs , gambling and women that ending was his own			1
as medics performed surgery the prolonged @entity1 's life by a few weeks , @entity51 recalls : ' our cameras were there when they opened up his skull			1
oh my @entity130 , it was so tough			0
' @entity1 ’s story began five decades earlier			0
he was raised by his father , @entity25 a stoic fisherman from @entity184 , after his mother died of skin cancer			1
she was just 27 , her son only eight			0
as @entity1 ’s own son , @entity15 , reflects : ‘ my grandpa did n’t know how to raise a kid			1
so he raised a worker			0
’ @entity1 was working on his father ’s boat while his peers played ball and were cossetted at home			1
@entity197 tried to be a good father according to his grandsons @entity13 and @entity15			1
@entity200 : @entity1 's second wife @entity201 whom sons @entity13 and @entity15 knew simply as ' @entity203 ' but with his wife dead and the need to hold down several jobs to provide for his son , @entity1 had plenty of opportunity to run wild			1
@entity1 was voted @entity211 to succeed on graduation from @entity213 and seemed determined to fulfil that destiny for much of his early teens			0
he left home at 15			0
he tore around town on his motorbike , got into trouble with the law , drank , smoked , partied and finally , for want of anything else to do , returned to the only the thing her knew , working for free on board a crabber			0
his job was to clean bait and his nickname was ‘ dirt ’ because of his lack of personal hygiene			0
still , @entity1 proved himself a worthy crew member and with status and catches came money			0
with money came vices or at least , for @entity1 , the funds to indulge them			0
much of this biography reads more like that of a rock star than a fisherman from @entity245 , @entity246			0
at times it is all more redolent of @entity248 , @entity249 than crabber captain @entity250 according to @entity13 : ‘ my dad once told me that when he was a young crab fisherman , he ’d get a big fat pay check , buy huge amounts of cocaine … rent the penthouse of a nice hotel , and rotate the girls in and out			1
‘ that ’s how he lived his life for a long time			1
he ’d get a check for $ 80,000 but after three weeks it was gone			0
’ he admits : ‘ pharmaceutical quality @entity262 flake cocaine and high - grade strains of cannabis were the way @entity1 rolled			1
’ one of the last images taken of @entity1 : a man who lived high on borrowed time addicted to speed : @entity1 with @entity272 driver @entity271 , left , at @entity273 in november 2008 , loved fast cars , fast bikes and loose women all his life @entity1 was a prodigious gambler who could go through $ 300 of chips in three seconds			1
he fell madly in love with first wife @entity59 – an unhappily married , mother of two working as a dancer in a grotty club when they met – but neither she nor the birth of their own children could keep him on the straight and narrow			0
though he went for periods relatively sober and apparently faithful to @entity59 , their nine year marriage was characterised by a cruel mutual infidelity – a tit for tat game in which there could be no true winner			0
drunk and high he once rode his @entity299 straight into the front room of the couple ’s home			0
he crashed cars and he wrecked marriages – his own and those of others			1
legend : @entity1 could ' pound a gallon of vodka , ' without drawing breath this was a man who could ‘ pound down a gallon of vodka without taking a breath , ’ before breakfast			1
years at sea in the company of @entity321 sailors had given him an insatiable taste for @entity324 vodka			1
in 1991 after nine years of marriage and 14 years together @entity59 and @entity1 divorced			0
he fought for custody of their sons and , remarkably , won			0
two years later he remarried			0
@entity15 and @entity13 make no secret of the contempt in which they held their stepmother , @entity201			1
in a shocking section of the book @entity13 describes her as ‘ an evil creature , ’ and admits that he and his brother referred to her as ‘ @entity203			1
’ they claim that she beat them and drove their father to depression			1
the couple divorced in 2003 after ten years of marriage and when @entity201 died of a heart attack in 2011 @entity13 state : ‘ i did n’t feel bad			1
she was one of the meanest people i ever met			0
’ shortly before his death @entity1 asked his first wife , @entity59 , to marry him again			1
she turned him down , telling him he was a much better friend than a husband			0
truth be known the man who emerges from the pages of this book seems a much easier person to watch than to know			0
he was wore his vices like virtues and remained an unreformed , unapologetic addict and wild man to the end			0
@entity1 : the @entity363 , @entity364 , our @entity365 ( $ 25.00 ) by @entity367 and @entity15 with @entity368 and @entity369 is published by @entity370 and available now at all good bookshops or on @entity372			1
