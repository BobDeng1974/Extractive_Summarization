@entity1 's opposition to the @entity3 staging fixtures overseas is not likely to change , according to the governing body 's general secretary @entity4			1
plans for a ' 39th game ' to be played as far away as @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 were scrapped in 2008 following widespread opposition , including from @entity12 and @entity1			1
the issue reared its head again , however , after @entity3 clubs ' chairmen discussed the proposal at a recent meeting but @entity4 believes @entity1 's stance will remain the same			1
@entity21 duo @entity20 ( left ) and @entity22 hold aloft the ' @entity23 ' after the @entity24 won the pre-season tournament in the @entity9 @entity21 's games abroad draw huge crowds , like this one in @entity28 for their clash against @entity30 ' we already have some associations who play games abroad so it is part of this wish to export national football overseas , ' @entity4 said at the leaders in @entity40 conference in @entity41			1
' we have to bear in mind though that there is a pyramid in place and that whenever these kind of things are discussed we have to act in a responsible way within the rules we 've all agreed together			2
' let 's see what the decision of @entity1 is on this			1
i do n't think it will change , it would have to be discussed , but i do n't think it will change			0
' any fixtures played overseas would need the approval of the host nation , the relevant confederation and @entity12			0
@entity61 plays the ball out of the back as @entity64 take on @entity65 in @entity66 last year @entity1 would only have jurisdiction over a fixture staged outside @entity69 if it was played elsewhere in @entity1			2
@entity71 chief executive @entity70 insists such a proposal would never get off the ground in @entity74 and suspects @entity12 would have objections too			0
' i think it 's a creative idea , i 'm not sure it would work with @entity12 , ' @entity70 said			0
'' we have a completely different approach about our idea of @entity74 football			0
' for the financial side it would be maybe a good idea to play a match all over the world , but for the supporters who are visiting 34 games of that club , no matter if it 's snow or rain or wind or whatever and they 're travelling			0
@entity4 addresses his audience at the leaders in @entity40 conference in @entity41 ' and on that game that has the impact that the team is going to be relegated and they can not be there , because it 's in @entity102 - i think this would not be an approach for the @entity71			1
' the @entity3 is not alone in looking to hold games abroad			2
@entity108 's @entity107 chief confirmed on tuesday the @entity110 match between @entity111 and @entity112 will be played in @entity113 , @entity114 on december 22 , while the @entity116 fixture has taken place abroad for the last six years .			0
