the former @entity18 actress said : ‘ it ’s a shock when someone does things to you , things you ’re not expecting			0
it is n’t that people suddenly become the bogeymen			0
abuse of children is gradual , this is why we now understand the term grooming			2
’ not wishing to get the men ‘ into trouble ’ she did n’t report the abuse immediately , but eventually went to social workers ‘ who did nothing ’			1
she said ‘ there was no support , no offer of counselling , no wanting to delve deeper			0
a lot of people who abused my friends were people in very , very top jobs within the social services			0
@entity21 was rife with that then			2
