by @entity0 @entity1 will today concede that @entity2 will not be able to reverse any of the @entity4 ’s spending cuts unless they are fully funded by budget reductions elsewhere			1
after three years of opposing almost every one of the government ’s attempts to bring down public spending , the @entity2 leader will risk disappointing core supporters by declaring that if he wins the next election he will not borrow more to undo any of them			1
however , @entity2 is still committed to borrowing billions more in order to fund spending on infrastructure projects , such as roads and power stations , and a temporary vat cut			1
leader of the @entity2 @entity1 has confirmed that he would not reverse the current @entity8 's austerity measures mr @entity1 ’s intervention comes ahead of chancellor @entity23 ’s latest spending review , due on wednesday , in which he will announce budgets for @entity8 departments for 2015/16			1
yesterday mr @entity23 said that in 2015/16 the @entity26 expects to take in £ 660 billion in taxes but on current plans expects to spend £ 745 billion			0
he added : ‘ the difference , nearly £ 90 billion , is made up of borrowing			2
‘ my job is to bring down that deficit so this country starts living within its means			0
’ mr @entity23 said the welfare bill for 2015 would be slashed by a further £ 3 billion , and insists another £ 11.5 billion of savings must be identified			0

labour leader mr @entity1 , addressing his party ’s @entity46 today , will seek to toughen its image on the economy after a series of polls showing it is still trailing the conservatives on the issue			1
@entity1 added that everybody in the @entity2 , including @entity55 , should be clear about where the money is coming from ‘ we wo n’t get to choose the circumstances of the next @entity2 government , ’ he will say			1

‘ our starting point for 2015/16 will be that we can not reverse any cut in day - to - day , current spending unless it is fully funded from cuts elsewhere or extra revenue – not from more borrowing			1
‘ so when @entity23 stands up next week and announces his cuts in day - to - day spending , we wo n’t be able to promise to reverse them because we can only do so when we can be absolutely crystal clear about where the money is coming from			1
‘ it ’s a hard reality			0
but i am clear about it , [ shadow chancellor ] @entity55 is clear about it , and everyone in the @entity2 should be clear about it too			2
‘ people will only put their hope in us if we show how we will make a difference			0

only if we have the discipline to face the challenge of our times can we change the direction of our country			0
’ mr @entity1 will also claim the nascent economic recovery is being enjoyed only by people at the top			2
