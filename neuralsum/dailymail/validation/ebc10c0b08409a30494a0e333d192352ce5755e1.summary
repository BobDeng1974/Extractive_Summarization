@entity0 claims @entity1 are back in the race for the @entity4 title after @entity5 were held 1 - 1 by @entity6			1
@entity1 beat @entity7 3 - 0 on saturday and @entity9 ’s side , who have not won the league since 2004 , are now seven points behind @entity5			1
@entity13 were beaten at @entity14 1 - 0 and @entity5 could only draw at @entity15			2
@entity0 has admitted that @entity1 have joined @entity5 and @entity13 in the title race the @entity17 struggled to break down @entity6 despite @entity19 's first - half opener at @entity15 @entity1 saw off the threat of @entity7 at the @entity21 on saturday with an impressive 3 - 0 win @entity0 said : ‘ of course @entity1 are in it			1
they are seven points behind @entity5 , but have one less match to play than @entity5			2
‘ both @entity13 and @entity1 are in the title race			1
it depends on the momentum for @entity1 - the 3 - 1 defeat against @entity30 or the 3 - 0 defeat against @entity7 ? ‘ so the danger is always there			1
but i keep saying , we are there			0
if someone had told me in august that , at the end of march , we 'd be six points in front with a match in hand , i 'd have signed for that immediately			0
‘ there are two perspectives			0
one perspective is a draw at home to @entity6 is not a good result			0
for me , that perspective is very acceptable			0
‘ the second perspective is we had a lead of five points from second , and now it 's six points with one less match to play			0
’ @entity0 believed a wrongly - awarded penalty denied his side an eight - point lead over @entity13 at the top of the league			1
the @entity61 coach was fined £ 25,000 for saying there was a ' clear campaign ' against his side after @entity65 was denied a penalty and booked for diving instead in the december 28 draw at @entity69 's			2
@entity0 says that @entity1 are a danger to @entity5 , although he is happy with his current strong position on sunday @entity0 was frustrated @entity72 was penalised - allowing @entity73 to score from the spot and cancel out @entity19 's first @entity4 goal for almost two months - while @entity76 was not awarded a spot kick at the other end			1
' i 'm happy with the situation			0
i 'm happy with the six - point lead , but i 'm not happy with the result , ' @entity0 said			2
' if you remember our two matches against @entity6 : in one game , one penalty that is not a penalty and in another game a penalty that was not given			2
you are speaking about six points transformed into two points			0
' @entity93 ( right ) gave @entity6 the penalty for their equaliser , @entity0 said that it ' is not a penalty ' @entity98 could not keep out @entity73 's spot - kick and the playmaker secured a point for @entity6 @entity0 was clearly upset with the penalty decisions , but bit his tongue on this occasion			1
he said : ' my opinion is not important			0
important is mr @entity93 ( the referee )			0
' his decision was a penalty and his decision was no penalty on @entity76			2
' @entity76 may have been clipped by @entity73 , but fell theatrically , dissuading @entity93 from pointing to the spot			1
@entity72 brought down @entity113 for @entity6 's equaliser but @entity0 was clearly upset @entity76 went down in search of a penalty but @entity93 did not give the desired spot - kick asked about the fall , @entity0 deferred to his media officer sitting alongside , saying : ' you have to control me , if not ... ' @entity0 was told television pundit @entity123 - with whom he had a public exchange of views this week after the @entity126 criticised @entity5 's conduct in the @entity129 exit to @entity130 - thought @entity72 had conceded a penalty			1
' @entity123 says also that it 's more a reason to criticise a player who asks for a yellow card than a player who kicks somebody in the chest , ' @entity0 added			1
' i went to @entity139 and they told me their pundits said it 's a penalty			0
i went to @entity142 and they told me it 's not a penalty			0
i went to the radios and they told me it 's not a penalty			0
@entity0 was told television pundit @entity123 thought @entity72 had conceded a penalty , and responded @entity0 said that pundits ' win every game ' due to their position of being critical but exempt from criticism ' pundits are paid to wear my suit , but i 'm not paid to wear their suit or to comment on their comments			1
' if one day i become a pundit , i will wear a manager 's suit			0
i will win every game , because pundits win every game , and then i can be critical and i can be phenomenal like they are			0
' @entity72 was replaced by @entity162 soon after a second - half foul on @entity164 which could have seen him booked for a second time - after his initial yellow when giving away the penalty - and sent off for a second successive @entity4 game			1
' when that penalty is given you have to believe that the second yellow card can come , ' said @entity0			1
@entity72 was substituted for @entity162 in the second half but could have seen a second yellow card for one foul @entity1 still not in title race - @entity9			2

@entity0 says @entity1 can be title *contenders* in the @entity4
but he *questions* whether @entity1 have the momentum after @entity30 defeat
@entity73 equalised from the spot after @entity19 put @entity17 *ahead*
@entity5 coach believed decision to award penalty was incorrect
@entity0 had a public *disagreement* with @entity123 this week
the special one was again critical of @entity123 ' comments *post-match*
