@entity0 sent a reserve team into the lion 's den as he made seven changes to the @entity5 starting line - up for the @entity7 match at the @entity8			1
there was no @entity10 , no @entity11 and no @entity12 in the starting xi against @entity14 on tuesday			2
in their place were @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 - hardly renowned as stalwarts of @entity5 's first - choice team so far this season			2
in some quarters , @entity0 ' men have been described as ' brave ' , as ' plucky ' , as having ' given a good account of themselves '			0
hard work and team ethic is a commendable attribute , but this is the @entity7 - @entity31 's elite competition			0
@entity32 ( left ) loses his marker and sticks the ball in the back of the net from around a yard out @entity0 made seven changes to the team that started on the weekend against @entity39 @entity32 runs to the delighted home supporters after scoring the first goal of the night in the @entity8 @entity10 ( left ) started the game on the bench and came on as a substitute for @entity17 137 - the seven players on the @entity5 bench had made 137 @entity7 appearances between them prior to kick - off last night			1
that ’s seven more than the number made by the players in their starting @entity13 130 - the number of @entity7 appearances made by @entity5 ’s starting @entity13 642 - the number of @entity7 appearances made by @entity14 ’s starting @entity13 £ 59 - the cost of an away ticket at @entity8 on wednesday			1
not to mention the added cost of flights and hotels			0
27 - shots at goal by @entity14 last night			1
that ’s 13 more than they managed in their 3 - 0 win at @entity66			1
2 - minutes played by @entity10 at the @entity8 prior to wednesday			2
he was a sub in a 1 - 0 win in 2009			1
he has now played a total of 23 minutes at the stadium			0
3,669 - tickets at the @entity8 allocated to @entity5 fans			1
@entity0 ’ team selection will have disappointed many who made the 1,796 - mile round - trip			2
unfortunately for @entity5 the statistics do not lie - and , on this occasion , they paint a bleak picture of a side who were never in the contest with @entity83 's side			1
so let us run through these numbers			0
first up , shots on goal			0
@entity14 's star - studded side managed 27 attempts on @entity91 's goal , with nine of them finding the target - including @entity32 's strike which separated the sides			1
when @entity14 destroyed @entity5 3 - 0 at @entity66 two weeks ago , they managed just 14 attempts on goal			1
the eight saves which @entity91 was forced to make ensured the @entity100 stopper made the most in a single game for @entity5 since the @entity100 faced @entity102 in november 2013 ( on which occasion he saved nine times )			2
@entity5 , on the other hand , managed a mere four attempts on goal			2
not four on target , four shots in total with just a solitary effort from @entity113 testing opposition keeper @entity112			2
in the first half they had precisely zero efforts on goal , while @entity14 had 13			0
what 's worse , they have now failed to score in three successive @entity7 game - the first time they have managed to do such a thing since september 2006			0
well how about blocked shots then ? @entity14 were denied by @entity5 defenders on 12 occasions while the @entity100 forced the home side to block just one effort			1
@entity19 , @entity5 's sole striker , did not register a shot in the entire match while attacking midfielders @entity129 and @entity131 managed just one between them			1
conversely , @entity14 's attacking trio of @entity32 ( two ) , @entity133 ( six ) and @entity134 ( one ) shared nine			2
@entity32 himself has scored an impressive five goals in four @entity7 appearances so far this season			0
his goal on tuesday also ensured he has scored in four consecutive @entity141 matches for the first time since march 2011			0
@entity91 ( second left ) looks dejected as @entity14 's players congratulate @entity32 after his opener @entity5 's captain for the night @entity146 walks off at half - time holding his head with his side 1 - 0 down the view from behind the goal as @entity91 stretches and acrobatically denies @entity133 ( left ) @entity0 decided to makes seven changes for tuesday night 's clash against @entity14			1
only @entity91 , @entity146 , @entity113 and @entity154 survived from the 1 - 0 defeat to @entity39 at the weekend			1
@entity5 starting @entity13 v @entity39 : @entity91 , @entity156 , @entity146 , @entity157 , @entity113 , @entity11 , @entity154 , @entity10 , @entity12 , @entity158 , @entity159 @entity5 starting @entity13 v @entity14 : @entity91 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity146 , @entity113 ; can , @entity17 ; @entity129 , @entity154 , @entity131 ; @entity19 so let 's move on to possession			1
as the home side you would expect @entity14 to shade it slightly , yet they kept the ball for 60.2 per cent of the match with @entity5 enjoying just 39.8 per cent possession			2
ok this statistic is not terrible , but the wastefulness and inept attacking ability of @entity0 ' side when on the ball was clear for all to see			0
@entity133 , @entity175 , @entity177 et al completed a staggering 711 passes with an accuracy of 90.9 per cent			0
@entity154 , @entity17 , @entity180 ? well they made just 479 passes with an accuracy of 86.6 per cent			0
interestingly , for an away side deemed as ' plucky ' and who expected to defend for long periods of the game , @entity5 won just 22 tackles to @entity14 's 24			1
the home side 's ratio of successful tackles was also higher as well ( 87.5 per cent to 72.7 per cent )			0
- @entity32 has scored five goals in four @entity7 appearances this season			0
- the @entity196 striker has scored in four consecutive cl games for the first time since march 2011			0
- in the first half , @entity5 failed to have an attempt of any kind			0
@entity14 had 13 shots ( including blocked )			0
- @entity14 finished the game with more shots on target ( 9 ) than @entity5 managed shots of any kind ( 4 )			1
- @entity5 's bench ( 137 ) had made more @entity7 appearances than their starting @entity13 ( 130 ) before tuesday 's match kicked off			1
- @entity91 made eight saves against @entity14			2
the last time he made more in a single game for @entity5 was versus @entity102 in november 2013 ( 9 )			0
- @entity5 have failed to score in three successive cl games for the first time since september 2006			0
- @entity14 have won 10 home @entity7 games in a row			0
@entity218 ( centre ) rises to collect a cross and deny @entity133 an effort at goal @entity0 stands stony - faced on the touchline at the @entity8 during @entity5 's defeat the @entity100 boss applauds the travelling fans at full time after @entity5 's defeat by @entity14 @entity14 also won more interceptions ( 21 to @entity5 's 15 ) , had far more corners ( seven to one ) , as well as destroying @entity5 in terms of the total number of crosses ( 23 to eight )			1
the 3,669 @entity100 supporters present at the game paid £ 59 per ticket for the @entity8 clash - not to mention the cost of travel and accommodation			1
they witnessed a starting @entity13 with just 130 @entity7 appearances between them - although there were 137 appearances sitting on the substitutes ' bench - take on the current @entity141 champions , who had nearly five times that number on display			0
these statistics are a damning indictment of @entity0 ' team selection			2
the scoreline may have been an extremely flattering 1 - 0 , and his side may have defended admirably at times , but the @entity5 boss must surely have learned never to put out a reserve team in @entity31 's premier competition again			1
@entity5 attempt to tackle goalscorer @entity32 during the @entity100 ' 1 - 0 defeat to @entity14 on tuesday @entity10 ( left ) , @entity156 ( centre ) and @entity12 watch on from the bench in @entity14 @entity5 boss @entity0 takes notes during the match ( was he writing down his starting line - up for @entity265 ? ) video we did n't need to play with intensity - @entity83			1
