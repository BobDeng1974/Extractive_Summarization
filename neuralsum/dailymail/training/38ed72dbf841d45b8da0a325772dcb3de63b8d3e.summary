by @entity0 @entity1 : 16:09 est , 12 december 2013 @entity2 : 16:16 est , 12 december 2013 a teacher 's union in @entity5 is fighting to force a city school district to pay a teacher convicted of molesting a student a $ 10,000 severance buyout , outraging the family of the young victim			1
the @entity12 is planning to take the case to arbitration in an attempt to force the @entity17 - @entity16 to pay former math teacher @entity18 - who was sentenced to 15 to 30 years in prison for repeatedly molesting the student - the buyout , a move the victim 's family calls ' ludicrous			1
' the money , the victim 's father , @entity25 , says any money owed to @entity18 by the district should be given to his son , who is ' out there trying to make it in this world all messed up			2
' monster : @entity18 was convicted of raping one of his students			0
now he wants the district to pay him a severance fee ' are they nuts in the head ? how can the union file a grievance and back a child molester ? we ’re very upset about it , ' @entity25 told @entity46			1
@entity18 was convicted over the summer of raping the young student over a three year period - from 2006 to 2009			1
the community was outraged when several other teachers in the district wrote letters supporting @entity18 , and urging the judge to give him a more lenient sentence			1
adding to the outrage was the fact that a school board member , @entity57 , sat with @entity18 's family during his sentencing after he pleaded guilty to first - degree sexual misconduct with a minor on may 8			0
many members of the community rallied behind the victim 's parents and urged the school board to fire teachers who were supporting @entity18			2
the district , however , opted to keep @entity18 's supporters rather than deal with the potential legal consequences of firing them			2
outraged : the victim 's parents , @entity74 and @entity75 , are furious that the union is seeking severance for their son 's rapist the union 's claim for @entity18 stems from an offer the school district made to teachers in march , which offered the $ 10,000 buyout to teachers to encourage them to quit rather than being laid off as the district needed to reduce staff due to budget cuts			1
the union 's plan to seek the $ 10,000 for @entity18 suggests that he was still on the payroll when it was offered , and that he accepted it - despite having already been indicted for molesting the boy			1
the district , however , declined to pay him the money , which is what prompted the union 's action			2
' you had to qualify for the buyout , depending on your years in the district , ' district superintendent @entity103			0
' we ’ve done it in the past			0
it was a little different this last year in that we offered the buyout in two $ 5,000 payments			0
' @entity110 : school board member @entity57 supports @entity18 and sat with his family during his sentencing @entity113 added that ' when the first payment was sent out ... and the union discovered we did not make the payment to mr. @entity18 , they filed a grievance on his behalf			0
' @entity113 says the decision to not pay the convicted child molester was his , but would not give a specific reason as to why			1
' that was something i as superintendent , with some consultation with the president of the board , ' decided , @entity113 said			0
' that was a decision the superintendent makes and at this point … i prefer not to get into the reasons			0
' however , as @entity136 notes , the reasons not pay @entity18 the severance ' seems pretty obvious			0

parents of the victim call the union 's actions ' ludicrous '
teachers in the district wrote letters in support of convicted child molester @entity18
@entity18 was sentenced to 15 to 30 years in prison for repeatedly molesting a young student
