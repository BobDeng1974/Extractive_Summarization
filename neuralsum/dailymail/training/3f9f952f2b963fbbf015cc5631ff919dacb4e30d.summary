defence chiefs were warned of significant security risks to the @entity2 of allowing @entity4 soldiers off their base in @entity6 , according to newly released documents			1
a report prepared before the troops ’ arrival on @entity2 soil warned of immigration , security and reputational risks if the cadets were allowed to leave the camp for ‘ recreational visits ’			1
but despite the warnings , the @entity18 admitted its rules that cadets should only be allowed outside the camp on supervised trips had been relaxed			0
more than 300 cadets arrived at @entity25 in june to undergo training but it was cut short in november after five were charged with sexual assaults more than 300 cadets arrived at @entity29 in june to undergo training as part of an effort to support @entity4 ’s beleaguered new government			1
initially local residents were assured that the cadets were only allowed out on escorted trips but these rules were later relaxed and they were allowed out on both supervised and unsupervised visits			0
their training was cut short in november after five were charged with sexual assaults			1
hundreds of them – except a handful who claimed asylum – were sent home in disgrace amid the allegations of rape , drunkenness , fighting and theft			0
it has now emerged a security and risk assessment document produced prior to the soldiers ’ arrival warned of the potential danger of allowing unsupervised visits			1
the report by the @entity60 , and obtained through a @entity61 submitted by the @entity62 , read : ‘ outward recreational visits pose significant immigration , security and reputational risks to the @entity2			1
’ @entity66 has previously hit out at the ' completely unacceptable ' breakdown of discipline among @entity4 soldiers in @entity6 it also acknowledged it was ‘ unrealistic and a risk to morale and discipline to confine persons to camp ’ for the duration of their 24 - week training			2
despite agreements that soldiers would not leave the camp unsupervised , the report shows the @entity18 was aware of three occasions when small groups were seen outside camp attempting to buy alcohol			0
asked about specific incidents involving @entity4 cadets off base , the @entity18 said sightings of them in local villages were reported on august 8,9 and 10			0
all of the recruits were located and returned to base			0
the pre-training security report pointed to ‘ widespread ’ sexual violence during the period of conflict in @entity4 , and added there was ‘ some evidence that it is a significant domestic problem which could be reinforced by cultural attitudes and entrenched by a lack of justice for those affected and for perpetrators			1
’ before arriving in the @entity2 , all cadets were subjected to a vetting process			1
however , the report said ‘ full background information ’ on trainees was unlikely to be available			2
the report went on to say : ‘ the risk of bad behaviour of trainees outside @entity112 is mitigated by the provisions of their visas , the supervisory measures in place for limited excursions and the security arrangements between the @entity18 , police and [ the ] @entity121			2
’ despite concerns about recruiting a balanced ethnic mix of cadets and their future once back home in @entity4 , the report ’s writers concluded : ‘ there is a much larger risk of not going ahead with training			2
‘ the prime minister has signed up to the @entity134 initiative			0
this commitment was made almost one year ago			0
the reputational risks for the @entity2 proceeding with training are assessed as much lower than not doing so			1
’ a spokesman for the @entity18 said : ‘ we have been clear that the behaviour of a small number of the @entity4 trainees was completely unacceptable and had a serious impact on members of the local community			0
‘ following the conclusion of the training the prime minister tasked the @entity18 with producing a report on the programme at @entity25 , including disciplinary issues			2
’ @entity153 was likely to be informed of the results of the report in the new year , he added .			0
