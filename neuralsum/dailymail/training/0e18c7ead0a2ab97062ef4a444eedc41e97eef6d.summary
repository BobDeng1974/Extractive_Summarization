by @entity0 published : 03:30 est , 31 december 2012 updated : 05:39 est , 31 december 2012 sickening : @entity1 claims the @entity3 love of food is well past its sell - by date novelist @entity1 has blasted @entity3 's pre-occupation with gourmet cuisine , celebrity chefs and tv food programmes			1
@entity1 , author of novels such as @entity12 , wrote his withering assessment of @entity3 's love of shows like @entity16 and great @entity3 bake - off in a blog on the @entity20 website called the @entity21			1
he said : ' it is , surely , undeniable that in the past 30 years we have , as a nation , been transformed from a culinary backwater - a stagnant reach in which floated the occasional soggy meat pie or waterlogged cabbage - into a foodie 's paradise			0
' what i think we should all do is throw up our very obsession with food itself , and enter the new year purged and able to forge a new relationship with whatever we happen to find on our plates			2
' @entity37 were perhaps home to a chippie , a @entity40 and an @entity41			0
' but now , even the most desultory and cloned shopping zone in the most provincial of towns will boast five , 10 or 15 eateries , all jostling for business with their exotic offerings			0
' however , @entity1 says it is people 's desire to be seen as middle class that drives their culinary endeavours			1
he said : ' now we find ourselves in a society in which the majority of people identify themselves as being middle class , but this ascription owes more to digestion than it does to acculturation , let alone occupation			1
' under the new dispensation , it was no longer necessary to read @entity64 , only munch on focaccia , just as you need n't trouble yourself with listening to @entity68 when it was so much easier to drink @entity69			0
' surely , much of the managerial work undertaken by these new middle classes consists in the running of those self - same food outlets where they too chow down			2
' once the working classes were in chains , now they 're in chain restaurants			0
' celebrity chefs : the inexorable rise of tv food programmes is partly to blame for our obsession with food , according to the novelist			2

' @entity3 has gone from culinary *wasteland* to *over-enthusiastic* gourmet bores '
author says food obsession is down to desire to be seen as middle class
