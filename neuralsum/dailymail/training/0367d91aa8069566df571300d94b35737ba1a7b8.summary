by @entity0 published : 18:56 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 05:49 est , 25 july 2013 after the birth of my son , through the fug of exhaustion , gas and air , i was sent off by the midwife to shower while my husband had his turn at cuddling and bonding with our scrumptious , sleepy baby boy			2
in a haze of euphoria as the warm water hit , i looked down at my body			2
for 40 weeks , it had steadily grown around my son , nurturing him while i carried on with my life , but now the firm bump had deflated			1
here to stay : @entity20 , baby @entity21 , @entity22 - and her post-baby bump almost the same size it had been a day earlier , it was softer , less defined			1
like a balloon the day after a party			0
in an instant , my baby bubble wobbled a little and i resolved to diet			0
so , on tuesday , when a glowing @entity22 presented her gorgeous son to the world , i sent up a silent cheer			1
i had expected her to appear in a billowing frock , perhaps holding her son lower down across her tummy , a long shawl perhaps - anything to hide her figure			1
her lovely mummy tummy was on full show in a belted , fitted dress			1
as the former editor of @entity47 magazine , i spent years trying to reassure women that their babies were n't the enemy of their bodies , despite harbouring the same fears myself			1
my heart would break every time i 'd read the postbag from readers who were upset and angry at the pressure they felt to be super-skinny at their six - week check - up			0
i still remember one reader who was devastated because her ' celebrity pregnancy twin ' - the star she was at the same stage as - was model @entity63			0
while our reader was wiping baby sick off the man - size t - shirts she was still wearing , @entity63 was off on modelling assignments			0
postpartum pride : @entity0 ( left ) thinks new mothers should be proud of their mummy tummies clearly , @entity63 started off with a amazing body and has the extra motivation of being employed for her looks , but even the most normal - seeming celebs smile back at us with a washboard stomach , mere weeks after giving birth			1
and so we ask ourselves : ' if she can do it , why ca n't i ? ' post-birth , i looked as though i could have popped another one out at any time , and i had been a size 10 before			1
but knowing i was normal did n't make me feel any less of a lump , and the low mood i had as a result spoiled what should have been a lovely time getting to know my baby			1
i was so sick of the dreaded stretch waistbands and empire - line dresses , and would n't let anyone go near me with a camera , always making sure i took the pictures of my beautiful boy , but was not in them myself			1
the truth is that the post-birth body has become alien to us			0
contrary to what some people seem to think , women are n't elastic bands			1
there is no snapping back - and certainly not in 24 hours ! bumps are not just babies , neither are they simply fat stores			0
the womb is an amazing thing that grows with the baby , and it needs time to readjust once its role as infant transport has ended			0
most doctors tell new mums not to expect to get near their pre-baby size until nine months later - any extra pounds took that long to go on , so it makes sense to wait that long for them to come off			0
admittedly , that did n't stop me starving myself in the hope i could get back to a size 10 ( six years on , i 'm still not there )			2
our bodies do n't just get bigger in pregnancy , they change shape , too			2
the ligaments around a woman 's pelvis stretch to make it easier to give birth			0
it takes at least a few weeks for them to go back towards their earlier shape			0
yet we are taunted by images of celebrity mothers who seem to give birth on tuesday and are back on the red carpet looking whip thin by the weekend			2
actress @entity141 says she spent six hours a day working out to get her pre-baby body back			0
@entity143 exercised six days a week with celebrity trainer @entity144 after the birth of daughter @entity146			0
joyous bond : @entity0 with son @entity148 , 6 while it 's important that new mothers in the real world remember the stars have personal trainers , special diets and nannies to allow them to focus on their bodies , the real lesson is that it 's far better to spend this time bonding with your baby			2
@entity22 shows every sign of doing this			1
she 's retreated to her parents ' home in @entity165 to be cared for while she gets on with the important job of resting and nesting with her new family			0
despite the pressure she must feel - she does , after all have the eyes of the world on her - she has already shown her pride in her post-birth bump			2
i wish i 'd seen more famous mummy tummies like @entity22 's before i had my son			1
it would have brought home to me the incredible , indelible changes that my body had gone through			0
i would n't have felt that my softer bump was ugly			1
i would have stopped bullying my body , respected my shape and embraced the change			0
let 's hope that @entity22 helps the next generation of new mothers to do the same .			1

new mothers take note : @entity22 is n't trying to hide her post-baby bump
like the @entity191 , you should embrace your postpartum tummy !
