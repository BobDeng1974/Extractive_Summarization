but the remarks come as the latest in a continuing war of words over the air space of the disputed @entity8 , which has seen @entity7 prime minister @entity23 brand @entity2 's plans unenforceable and dangerous			1
dispute : @entity25 is one of the five uninhabited islands at the centre of an increasingly hostile debate between @entity7 and @entity2			2
both countries name them as their own @entity23 told a parliamentary session that @entity2 's declaration of an air defense identification zone alters the state of affairs in the @entity9 and escalates a tense situation			1
he said : ' the measures by the @entity2 side have no validity whatsoever for @entity7 , and we demand @entity2 revoke any measures that could infringe upon the freedom of flight in international airspace			1
' it can invite an unexpected occurrence and it is a very dangerous thing as well			0
' on saturday , @entity16 issued a map of the zone and a set of rules which say all aircraft must notify @entity2 authorities and are subject to emergency military measures if they do not identify themselves or obey @entity16 's orders			1
@entity23 said the measures one - sidedly impose rules set by the @entity2 military on all flights in the zone , and violate the freedom to fly above open sea , a general principle under the international law			1
@entity23 also slammed @entity2 for showing the disputed islands , called @entity8 in @entity7 and @entity8 in @entity2 , as @entity2 territory in the zone			1
since taking office almost a year ago , @entity23 has been spearheading a move to step up @entity7 's defense capability , citing threats from @entity2 's growing maritime and military presence in the region			1

@entity82 's @entity10 summoned @entity2 's military attache in @entity87 , saying the zone is unacceptable because it was drawn unilaterally , according to ministry officials			2

he said it is not aimed at any country and it does not affect freedom of overflight			0
but the move has not gone down well over seas and both @entity4 secretary of state @entity112 and secretary of defense @entity113 have said the @entity4 is ' deeply concerned ' about @entity2 's action			1

warning : @entity4 secretary of state @entity112 speaks to journalists in @entity121			2

the @entity4 does n't take a position on who has sovereignty over the islands but recognizes they are under @entity7 administration			0
