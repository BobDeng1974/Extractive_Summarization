by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:38 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 12:22 est , 25 october 2013 warning : prime minister @entity2 said he would target green levies and company profits to bring down energy bills huge rises in energy bills are ‘ morally wrong ’ at a time when costs for power firms are not rising , @entity2 said today			1
the prime minister took aim at companies which have announced price hikes of up to 10 per cent in recent days , as he promised ‘ action ’ to curb the profits of the @entity17 energy firms			1
it also emerged @entity19 want to cut the green levies on bills by £ 50 , to counter claims the government is not acting to ease the rising cost of living			1
the @entity25 is second only to @entity26 among @entity28 nations for the number of people who are struggling to pay their energy bills , according to research by the fuel poverty alliance @entity34			0
@entity36 yesterday became the latest firm to announce eye - watering price rises , warning bills will go up by 9 per cent within weeks			0
it follows @entity40 announcing a 10.4 per cent price hike , @entity41 promising a 9.2 per cent rise and @entity44 an 8.2 per cent increase			0
at a press conference in @entity47 , mr @entity2 was asked if the energy giants were ‘ morally wrong ’ to increase their costs , following rises by four of the @entity17 firms			1
mr @entity2 said : ‘ on power bills i think it is wrong for bills to go up when wholesale prices are not going up substantially , but we have to look at the causes of why bills are going up and act on those causes rather than just have some sort of blanket policy that does n't work			1
‘ that 's why i 've identified , of the four parts to a bill - you 've got the wholesale prices , the transmission costs , the green taxes and charges , and then you 've got the profits that the companies are making - it 's those last two where we need action			2
‘ so , on the profits you need more competition , you need more challenge , i want more companies in that sector , i want the competition in the market properly reviewed every year , and we will have that			0
‘ on the green charges , yes , we should be trying to roll the cost of those back , in the best way that we can because that is one of the things that has been adding to bills in recent years			2
’ charges : four of the @entity17 energy firms have announced price hikes of up to 10 per cent in recent days the threat to target the profits of energy firms comes after former @entity95 prime minister sir @entity94 this week called for an ‘ excess profits tax on the energy companies ’ to claw back money to money help for the elderly to keep warm this winter			1
mr @entity2 has rejected the idea , insisting a review of competition in the industry , due to be announced next week , will bring more competitors into the market and p to cut bills			2
the prime minister is also locked in negotiations with his @entity112 deputy @entity111 over the future of green levies which push up bills by more than £ 100 - a - year			1
warning : deputy prime minister @entity111 insisted he would not allow green levies to be scrapped altogether government insiders indicate that mr @entity2 wants any change to green levies to have a significant impact on bills , and hope to be able to promise customers a reduction of at least £ 50			1
mr @entity111 today said he would not allow all green levies to be axed following the @entity109 's surprise announcement earlier this week that ‘ roll back ’ the charges			1
but they could be paid for from general taxation instead of added costs on energy bills			1
the @entity112 leader told @entity130 's @entity129 : ‘ removing all the levies is an incredibly bad idea and i would never support it			2
‘ it 's certainly not an idea which this coalition government is going to put forward			0
’ official advice issued by @entity136 ( @entity136 ) says people should keep their homes warm , with living room temperatures of @entity140 ( @entity141 ) and bedrooms and the rest of the house heated to @entity145 ( 65f )			0
it says temperatures above this ' may waste money ' but below this ' may risk your health '			0
if people are unable to afford to heat all their rooms , they are advised to heat their living room during the day and bedrooms just before going to bed			0
but mr @entity111 insisted : ‘ i 'm certainly not giving people advice on what to wear and what to do with their own thermostats			2
’ the cost of going green the prime minister insisted that any action the government took on green levies would be done in a transparent fashion			1
he repeated his assertion that @entity172 's pledge to freeze bills if he won power in 2015 was a ‘ con ’ because no politician could prevent fluctuations in the oil and gas markets			2
‘ what matters is getting to grips with the causes of things that are causing the bills to rise , ’ he said			0
‘ that must be done in an open and transparent way , so that if you end what 's causing the charge to rise that 's transparent , if you move a charge from a bill to somewhere else that 's transparent			0
‘ what is a con is saying “ i 'm going to cap energy prices ” when actually you 're not doing anything to deal with the reason why they are increasing			0
’ he said the @entity25 public are ‘ basically very smart and they know that energy bills can go up when the world price of oil and gas goes up ’ .			0

@entity2 wants to reduce bills by £ 50 by reducing green levies
