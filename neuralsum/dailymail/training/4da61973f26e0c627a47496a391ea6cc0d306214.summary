by @entity0 published : 13:10 est , 18 october 2012 updated : 13:42 est , 18 october 2012 for five million years after the worst mass extinction in @entity4 history , much of the planet was simply too hot for anything to survive , scientists have learned			1
experts have long been puzzled by the ' broken world ' scenario that followed the @entity12 - @entity11 mass extinction 250 million years ago			1
up to 96 % of all marine species and 70 % of land - dwelling vertebrates were wiped out by the event , thought to have been caused by a combination of climate change and volcanic activity			2
a paleogeographic reconstruction of the early @entity21 world around 252 - 247 million years ago , showing a ¿ dead zone ¿ in the tropics where experts say no life could have existed temperatures in the tropics rose to lethal levels , soaring to @entity29 on land and @entity31 in the sea , and prevented life re-emerging			1
during the long heatwave no forests grew in the tropics , only shrubs and ferns , and shellfish were the only marine creatures in the oceans			0
virtually no land animals existed because their metabolisms would not have withstood such high temperatures			2
only the polar regions offered a habitable refuge from the baking heat			0
typically it takes tens of thousands of years for new species to appear after a mass extinction			1
but in the case of the @entity11 event , this ' dead zone ' lasted an extraordinary five million years			1
a new study has now indicated why			0
temperatures in the tropics rose to lethal levels , soaring to @entity29 on land and @entity31 in the sea , and prevented life re-emerging			1
' global warming has long been linked to the end - permian mass extinction , but this study is the first to show extreme temperatures kept life from restarting in equatorial latitudes for millions of years , ' said lead researcher @entity67 , from the @entity68			1

virtually no land animals existed because their metabolisms would not have withstood such high temperatures			2
only the polar regions offered a habitable refuge from the baking heat			0
a breakdown in global carbon cycling was responsible for the hothouse conditions , according to the researchers writing in the journal @entity88			0
normally plants help regulate temperature by absorbing carbon dioxide and sealing it away in vegetable matter			0
without plants , levels of the greenhouse gas rose unchecked , causing temperatures to rise			1
the scientists collected data from 15,000 conodonts - tiny teeth from extinct eel - like fishes - from rocks in southern @entity103			0
the scientists collected data from 15,000 conodonts - tiny teeth from extinct eel - like fishes - from rocks in southern @entity103			0
by studying oxygen atoms in the conodonts , they were able to calculate temperature levels many millions of years ago			2
professor @entity109 , from the @entity110 of @entity4 and the @entity111 , said : ' nobody has ever dared say that past climates attained these levels of heat			0
' hopefully future global warming wo n’t get anywhere near temperatures of 250 million years ago , but if it does we have shown that it may take millions of years to recover			1

experts say ' broken world ' that followed the @entity12 - @entity11 mass extinction meant no life for five million years in a huge ' dead zone '
temperatures in the tropics rose to lethal levels , soaring to @entity29 on land and @entity31 in the sea
