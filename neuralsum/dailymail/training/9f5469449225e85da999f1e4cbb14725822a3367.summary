for people who suffer from serious disabilities like @entity3 ’s or motor neurone disease , communication can be incredibly difficult			0
but a 16 - year - old - has designed a device that could provide a promising solution , as it lets people communicate using just their breath			1
called talk , the device works by recognising shorts bursts of air as @entity12 and turning the words and sentences into speech , enabling the severely paralysed to communicate with others			1
the innovative project is an entry in @entity25 's 2014 @entity24			1
it works using a tube to measure two lengths of breaths - dots and dashes - in @entity12 talk , from @entity19 @entity18 , is one of 15 finalists in @entity25 ’s @entity34 project , reports @entity35			1
he says that 1.4 per cent of the world ’s population suffer from disorders that make regular communication all but impossible			0
in addition he says current devices are expensive and bulky , and do not offer a suitable alternative to regular speech			0
his idea was to make a gadget that was affordable , faster , portable and generic			0
what is the @entity48 ? the @entity48 is a global online science and technology competition for individuals and teams aged 13 to 18			0
participants must formulate a hypothesis , perform an experiment and then present their results			0
@entity56 is one of 15 teenagers in the 2014 @entity48 finals			0
the winning project will receive a 10 - day tip to the @entity62 , £ 30,000 ( $ 50,000 ) in scholarship funding and a visit to @entity66 ’s @entity65 in the @entity67			0
it works by recognising two distinguishing exhales from a person in @entity12 - a short burst and a slightly longer one			2
this mimics the action of dots and dashes in @entity12			2
the breaths are recorded by a tube that attaches under a person ’s nose and into an external device			2
inside the device the bursts of air are converted into words and sentences , and then read aloud by one of nine synthesised voices			0
talk also has a second mode , which lets the user speak in specific commands or phases			1
‘ i got predicted results by testing the device with a person suffering from @entity97 [ a disease of the brain ] and parkinson 's disease , ’ @entity18 writes in his proposal			2
‘ in future i would like to add auto - predictions to my @entity103 and integrate talk with modern technology like @entity106 to make the world a better place to live [ for ] people with developmental disabilities			0
’ the winning project in @entity25 's @entity24 will receive a 10 - day tip to the @entity62 , £ 30,000 ( $ 50,000 ) in scholarship funding and a visit to @entity66 ’s @entity65 in the @entity67			1
the @entity12 breaths are sent to a synthesiser and spoken aloud by one of nine voices			1
a second mode lets the user speak in commands or phrases			1
@entity18 says the device could be used by sufferers of @entity3 's , @entity125 ( such as professor @entity126 , shown above in 2008 ) and other conditions to more easily communicate			1

@entity19 @entity18 has unveiled a device that converts nose breaths into speech
the innovative project is an entry in @entity25 's 2014 @entity24
it works using a tube to measure two lengths of breaths - dots and dashes - in @entity12
these are then sent to a synthesiser and spoken aloud by one of nine voices
a second mode lets the user ' speak ' in commands or phrases
@entity18 says the device could be used by sufferers of @entity3 's , @entity125 and other conditions to more easily communicate
