by @entity1 reporter published : 05:51 est , 16 april 2012 updated : 08:43 est , 16 april 2012 a mother - of - four has shed six stone after she living on a diet of fruit and vegetables for two years - to stop her smelling like fish			1
@entity9 , 34 , has a rare metabolic disorder called @entity11 ( @entity12 ) , also known as fish odour syndrome , where the body ca n’t break down trimethylamine , which is found in certain foods including milk and eggs			1
it causes the chemical to build up in her system before it is released in her sweat , urine , and breath , giving off a strong fishy odour			1
@entity9 with her daughter @entity26 before she was diagnosed ( left ) and today after her new diet saw her shed 6st @entity9 was diagnosed two years ago but her unfortunate odour has been following her around since she was in her early twenties			1
strangers have shouted at her in the street and she said it even forced to quit her job as a care assistant in a residential home			1
but now thanks to her extreme diet , @entity9 has been able to keep her fishy odour under control and at the same time lose weight			1
@entity9 , from @entity41 , said : ' you ’re supposed to have other things in small amounts but they still make me stink			1
' so i only eat fruit and vegetables			1
it ’s made me lose six stone			1
' the diet does get me down but i have got to stick to it			1
i would n’t be able to go out if i did n’t			2
i ’d be too embarrassed			2
' people do n’t look at me or comment as much now			2
i ’m starting to live again			2
' @entity9 , who ca n’t smell her odour , was having up to ten showers a day after family and friends started commenting on her fishy whiff			1
she said : ' one day , i was cleaning my teeth just before i was about to go out and my sister told me i should do it at least three times because i stank			2
' i brushed it off			2
i thought it was a typical sister thing			2
' more people started commenting on it			2
it really started getting to me			2
that ’s when i started to become really obsessive with cleaning			2
' fish free : @entity9 with some of the food she enjoys now when she went to see her doctor , they did various tests , which all came back negative			1
@entity9 ’s doctor concluded she suffered from body odour and halitosis			1
she said : ' i was in and out of my gps every month			2
i think they thought i was a hypochondriac			0
' i thought it was coming from my teeth so i lied to my dentist and said i was in pain so he removed some of them			0
' i was brushing my teeth 20 times a day			0
i was brushing so hard my gums were receding			0
' around the same time , she started having panic attacks and for a year , she only left the house when she had to go to work			1
@entity9 said : ' i was sick of people looking at me			1
people would shout at me to brush my teeth			0
' people said i smelled of poo , it ’s not nice being told that			0
' i was working nights in a residential home and when i did hand over , the rest of the staff would move to the other end of the room			0
' i knew they were thinking : ‘ she does n’t wash			0
’ they used to laugh behind my back			0
' @entity9 says she locks herself in her house for the weekend if she fancies a takeaway @entity9 even contemplated suicide because of it and she was put on anti-depressants as well as having counselling			1
however , after watching a programme about someone with fish odour syndrome , @entity9 was finally diagnosed with the disorder			1
she said : ' as soon as i saw it on the television , i though i bet i have got that			0
by then , my doctor was sick of me and said i would n’t because it ’s so rare			0
' she agreed to do a test though and when the result came back positive she apologised			0
it was a real relief to get a diagnosis			0
' a dietician has put @entity9 on a strict diet and warned her to cut out any foods that make her disorder worse			1
most foods cause her to stink , including some fruit and vegetables , so @entity9 has limited her diet to strawberries , pears , carrots , turnips , potatoes and salad			1
although , she can eat honey and rice in small amounts as well as bread , but only if it is freshly baked			0
she said : ' sometimes i treat myself to a takeaway on a friday night just lock myself away all weekend			0
' @entity9 said her four children , @entity149 , 17 , @entity150 , 13 , @entity26 , six , and two - year - old @entity151 have helped her stay strong			1
she said : ' if it was n’t for them , i would n’t be here			0
' dr @entity154 , a consultant in @entity155 at @entity156 in @entity157 , said said : ' @entity11 is caused by an inability to break down trimethylamine in the liver			0
' there is an inherited form of the condition called @entity11			0
it ’s caused by a faulty gene but that is extremely rare			0
' in most patients this gene is normal and we think that trimethylamine builds up due either to the fact that the enzyme has stopped working properly , which might be to do with hormone levels , or that the bacteria in their gut are producing too much trimethylamine for the enzyme to cope with			0
' there ’s no cure but treatment aims to reduce trimethylamine levels in the body and control the symptoms			1
' we do this by trying to limit the amount of trimethylamine entering the body			1
we recommend a special diet which is low in trimethylamine and in another chemical called choline , which can be converted to trimethylamine by gut bacteria			0
' we also use a combination of courses of antibiotics and probiotics to try to reduce the numbers of trimethylamine - producing bacteria in the gut			0
' most patients can reduce their trimethylamine levels and their symptoms with these sorts of treatment			0

@entity9 was shouted at in the street and *bullied* at work because of her body odour
