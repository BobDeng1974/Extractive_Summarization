@entity0 led a parade of the world ’s leading tennis players down the sweeping staircase of a luxury boat that cruised along the @entity6 on friday night			0
the top eight players , minus the absent @entity8 , were suited and booted , with @entity9 delighted to be involved , especially compared to what he was doing this time 12 months ago			1
back then the only thing he had to look forward to during the week of the @entity13 was the @entity14 of painful recovery work from the back operation he had a month previously			2
@entity9 prepares for his opening match in the @entity19 at the @entity20 in @entity21 coach @entity22 watches over the @entity24 no 1 as he hones his groundstrokes ahead of the event @entity9 is pleased to return to the elite tournament after spending last november recovering from surgery sunday 's order of play at the @entity31 although a big football fan , the constant visits to @entity35 ’s @entity34 training ground were not something to relish			1
‘ most days i did rehab from nine in the morning through until five - something , ’ he recalled			0
‘ in the mornings , i was doing my rehab at @entity35 ’s training ground and then , in the afternoons , i would either go back there or i have a space in my house where i have a few bits and pieces of equipment			2
' i could do some pilates , core - type exercises and more rehab			0
‘ when you ’re away from the game , you realise how much you miss playing but i was n’t bitter about not being here , it ’s just part of what we do			0
' some people go through their whole career without any injuries , some are injury prone and i would say i ’ve been fairly lucky			0
' last year was obviously tough but i certainly watched bits of the tennis here			2
’ @entity9 faces @entity70 star @entity69 , who is coached by @entity71 ( r ) , in his first group rubber @entity73 legend @entity0 speaks with his coach , another 1980s player , @entity74 at courtside @entity76 is favourite to win the tournament and finish the year ranked world no 1 at 2pm on sunday he will be the subject of tv viewers ’ attention as he takes on @entity70 ’s @entity69 in the opening round robin match , while @entity0 against @entity83 is the evening ’s main attraction			1
considering the finals take place in his adopted hometown , and he is a decent indoor player , @entity9 has never done as well as he might at the @entity31 , a semi-final being his best finish to date			1
having worked so hard to make the top eight this year he is committed to try to improve on that and set himself up for 2015			0
beating @entity69 and improving on his 3 - 0 record against him would be a perfect start			1
‘ i ’m not exactly where i would like to be , i still want to get four or five per cent better			0
but compare it to where i was four or five months ago and i am much , much closer , ’ added @entity9			2
