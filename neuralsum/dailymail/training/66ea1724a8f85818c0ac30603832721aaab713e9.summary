not content with carrying out an ingenious escape under the noses of their zookeepers , a pair of runaway monkeys is trying to break back in			1
only this time the mischievous monkeys are attempting to find their way into people ’s houses			2
the capuchin monkeys left staff at the @entity13 red - faced over the weekend when they each managed to escape on subsequent days			1
a number of people have reported seeing the animals close to where the zoo is based and now the primates have sparked a police search operation after they have been seen loitering in gardens and trying to make their way into families ’ houses			1
zookeepers have yet to track down the miniscule animals despite reported sightings across @entity17 , @entity18 , close to where the zoo is based			1
the monkeys , which are known for their cunning and intelligence , have even been spotted sitting nonchalantly outside pubs at night			1
while the animals do not provide an immediate risk , police said they may bite or scratch anybody who approaches them			1
while the animals do not provide an immediate risk to the public , police say they may bite or scratch anybody who approaches them it is still unclear how the monkeys managed to escape from the zoo , which is home to more than 1,000 animals			1
a young female monkey was reported missing on saturday and was shortly joined on the run by another monkey that escaped on sunday			0
pictures have appeared online showing the animals sitting on a garage and at the side of a road			2
but the zoo ’s hopes of finding the monkeys will be buoyed by the success of a similar operation only four years ago			2
on that occasion a three - year - old capuchin called @entity68 went on the run for five days			0
he was eventually caught by the zoo ’s owner @entity72 wandering around in a local graveyard			0
the @entity75 in @entity17 in @entity18 , where the two monkeys escaped from capuchin monkeys are best known as the breed used by organ grinders			1
their intelligence means that they can even be trained to perform household tasks and are often used in laboratories			0
the animals , which are only 40cm tall and weigh between 1.3 - 4kg , are native to @entity86 – predominantly the @entity88 rainforest			2
@entity89 , who spotted the first escapee running along pavement in the town centre , said : ‘ i was surprised and worried that it would get run over			0
‘ from a distance i thought it was a young cat as it was slim and moving quickly , but as i drove closer i realised that it was n’t			0
i hope it gets back to the zoo ok			0
’ a spokesman for @entity18 police said : ‘ police were called today at 9.11am with confirmation that a second monkey has escaped			1
zookeepers have been unable to track down the two capuchin monkeys despite reported sightings ( file photo ) ‘ this follows a juvenile female @entity110 monkey that escaped at the weekend and has been sighted in the @entity17 area			1
‘ these animals do not pose an immediate risk to the public , however it is capable of biting or scratching anyone who attempts to approach it			2
’ an incident at the 17 - acre zoo , which first opened in 1994 , was the subject of an inquest last month			0
animal keeper @entity122 , 24 , was mauled to death by a tiger that had access to a restricted corridor in which she was standing			0
she had been working in the supposedly safe keeper ’s corridor , from which she could access the tiger pens through metal doors , which were bolted shut			0
but the inquest was told that a bolt on a door between the tiger ’s pen and the corridor used by keepers had been ‘ defective ’ .			0
