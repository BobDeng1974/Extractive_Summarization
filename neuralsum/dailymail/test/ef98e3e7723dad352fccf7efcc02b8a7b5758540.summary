it seems to happen after every single @entity1 that someone near to the top of @entity5 cricket gets the sack			1
whether it be @entity8 , @entity9 , whoever , someone always seems to pay the price for our abject failure to compete on the global one - day stage			0
@entity14 is just the latest victim			1
it is high time that we looked at the entire structure of @entity5 cricket and the reasons we are incapable of producing the types of cricketer required to succeed in international one - day cricket			1
@entity14 has left his role as managing director of @entity25 @entity26 ( from left to right ) , @entity27 and @entity25 captain @entity28 during the press conference the system is broken and it desperately needs fixing if @entity25 are ever going to compete in limited - overs cricket again			1
make no mistake , sacking @entity14 does not mean some magic wand has been waved and all will be well			2
there are deep systemic problems			0
too many of the current selectors and coaches are from the old guard and have failed to keep pace with the dramatic changes that have occurred in one - day cricket in recent years			0
from @entity27 to coach @entity26 , to selectors @entity44 and @entity45 , these are players from a different era who have been painfully slow to react to situations			1
@entity14 ( left ) and @entity26 ( right ) pose during a press conference at @entity50 @entity14 leaves his role as @entity25 managing director following @entity25 's shameful performance at @entity1 even the sacking of @entity28 as one - day captain was a slow and protracted affair			1
they should have acted sooner			0
like so much of @entity5 sport , our cricket system seems afraid of the maverick player and that has to change			2
in my view there is still too much bad blood around for @entity67 to return , with the fall - out from the book causing untold damage to so many relationships that it just seems inconceivable for him to return			0
@entity74 believes the sacking of @entity28 as one - day captain was a slow and protracted affair i hate it when things become about one individual and believe me , everything that has gone wrong with @entity5 cricket has not been down to the handling of @entity67 ; however badly that has been done			1
but what is does highlight is the continued fear of the maverick player			0
from @entity88 to @entity67 , @entity5 cricket has shown distrust for anyone who does not conform or fit into a safe stereotype even though all the players who are thriving on the world stage are non-conformists who do things differently			1
you would n’t find @entity97 or @entity98 audacious shot - making in an @entity100 coaching manual but you will not find two better strikers of a cricket ball on the planet			0
@entity5 cricket needs to learn to embrace the maverick			1
@entity67 has rejoined @entity105 in the hope of earning a place in the @entity109 squad for @entity25 this summer @entity74 hopes whoever is appointed to replace @entity14 is close to the modern game and ahead of the curve i have been asked if i would like to take on @entity14 ’s job and the short answer is ‘ no ’			2
i will do anything i can to help the @entity25 and @entity5 cricket but there are far better candidates than me out there			2
whether it be @entity122 , @entity123 or anyone else , i just hope whoever they appoint is close to the modern game and ahead of the curve			0
we have been behind it for far too long.most importantly , it is time to wake up and look at the big picture			0
stop finding individuals to scapegoat and carry the can and start looking at the system that is failing to produce the kind of cricketers we need .			0

@entity74 believes it 's time to look at the structure of @entity5 cricket
@entity74 believes @entity14 is just the latest victim to take the *flack*
he feels the system is broken and desperately needs attention and fixing
@entity28 's sacking shows we are painfully slow to react problems
