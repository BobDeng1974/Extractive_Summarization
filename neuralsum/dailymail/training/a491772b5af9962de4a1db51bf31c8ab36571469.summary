constantly worrying wo n’t just give you sleepless nights – it could also raise your risk of @entity4 ’s			2
women who are anxious , jealous and moody in middle - age were twice as likely to suffer from the brain disease in old age as their more calm and level - headed counterparts			1
they found that as the number of people with dementia is expected to increase ‘ dramatically ’ as the population ages , it is important to have ways of identifying those most at risk			1
the prime minister @entity29 has described dementia as ‘ the key health challenge of this generation ’			0
some 800 women in their late 30s , 40s and early 50s underwent a battery of personality tests			0
this included questions on neuroticism – characterised by being anxious , jealous , moody and easily upset and plagued by feelings of guilt			0
they were also asked if they had been under stress at work , at home or due to their health – and this question was repeated every five years			2
when the study ended after 38 years , some 153 women had developed dementia			0
those who scored highest on tests for neuroticism in middle - age – were particularly prone to the disease – but only if they had been under long - term stress			1
@entity61 who were also shy and introverted were at the highest risk , the journal @entity60 reports			1
the researchers said those who are neurotic may feel stress more keenly and this could take its toll on the brain			1
it is also possible that they have a less healthy lifestyle			0
@entity69 who were also shy and introverted were at the highest risk of dementia , researchers found study author @entity73 said : ‘ most @entity4 ’s research has been devoted to factors such as education , heart and blood risk factors , head trauma , family history and genetics			1
‘ personality may influence the individual ’s risk for dementia through its effect on behaviour , lifestyle or reactions to stress			1
‘ the number of people with dementia is expected to rise dramatically			0
it is therefore important to identify risk and protective factors			0
’ dr @entity97 , of the @entity98 said : ‘ we all have moments when we feel stressed or worried , but stressed women reading this should n’t take this research to mean they ’re necessarily at higher risk of dementia			1
‘ this research does n’t show that neuroticism in women alone could increase risk of developing alzheimer ’s disease , but what it does suggest is that personality traits like neuroticism are linked to the experience of long term stress			2
‘ while we ca n’t control all the sources of everyday stress , we can develop coping strategies to deal with them and we ’re funding research to help explore how this could help with reducing risk of dementia			2
’ dr @entity123 , of @entity124 , said : ‘ understanding the factors that affect our risk of @entity4 ’s could provide new clues for preventing the disease , which is why investment in research is crucial			0
’ previous research has found that conscientious men and women , who ‘ always get the job done ’ are half as likely to develop @entity4 ’s as their less dependable friends and colleagues .			0

this was *compared* to their more calm and level - headed counterparts
@entity61 who were also shy and introverted were at the highest risk
may be because they feel stress more keenly - which takes its toll on brain
number of number of sufferers worldwide predicted to be 44 million by 2050
