@entity0 has called on the @entity1 to resist any temptation to mimic their @entity4 counterparts by overhauling the season ’s finale			1
the race to @entity9 has become all but a procession for @entity11 , whose lead is almost insurmountable heading into the penultimate event of the tour at the @entity16 this week			1
@entity11 ’s lead of close to three million points is such that he is missing the event in @entity20 , which starts on thursday , and it would require at least wins here and in @entity9 next week from any of @entity23 , @entity24 or @entity25 for the @entity26 to not emerge with the title			1
@entity0 believes that is a model the @entity1 should not replicate too closely , even if it would make for a more exciting conclusion to the season			1
he said : ‘ there 's going to be flaws in it , whichever way you go			2
i 'm a big fan of somebody showing consistency over the whole year and winning it			2
if you look at @entity11 's season , he 's won two major championships , a @entity60 , and our flagship event , the @entity61 , which is a phenomenal year			1
‘ if you put that up in somebody 's career , those four tournaments , that would be a good career , and he 's done that in six months , basically			0
@entity0 ( left ) and @entity24 take on a unique challenge in the @entity69 city of @entity20 on tuesday @entity24 ( left ) , @entity0 ( centre ) and @entity72 attempt to hit golf balls over the towering walls of the @entity75 of @entity76 a general view of the stunning 2,000 year - old amphitheater of @entity76 during the challenge ‘ occasionally somebody will do something extraordinary and deserves to win the money list			1
if you have it where it 's all on the last event , we are getting into that area of copying the @entity34 and copying the @entity88			1
‘ people complain that it 's a little too volatile at the end			0
i 've looked over the last few years and it just seems that whoever wins the @entity46 wins the fedexcup in the @entity96			0
you can look at that one of two ways - that 's not ideal sometimes			0
‘ i have no problems with it being over before the final event , especially this year with what @entity11 has done			1
’ @entity0 , meanwhile , echoed his support for @entity107 ’s bid to be @entity110 ’s 2016 @entity109 captain			2
@entity0 competes in this week 's @entity16 , the penultimate event of the @entity1 @entity0 , who had backed @entity107 for the role that ultimately went to @entity113 for this year ’s event , said : ‘ i think @entity115 is very lucky			1
it 's got lots of good candidates , lots of former @entity109 players that have got experience of many different captains			0
‘ it 's probably between @entity107 and @entity29			0
@entity107 just edges it for me			0
there ’s his record and also with it being in the @entity96 where @entity107 's got a good reputation			0
not that @entity29 has n't , but @entity107 's won @entity60 over there and he 's played the @entity34 quite a bit and been a member of that tour			2
‘ i backed @entity107 last time and @entity113 got it ; and i was wrong - @entity113 was a great captain			0
i 'd like to see @entity107 get it next time around and sit down with @entity113 and let @entity113 shoot a few ideas at him and feed off that momentum that @entity113 really built up as far as being the captain			0

@entity11 has an almost insurmountable lead in the race to @entity9
@entity0 has urged the @entity1 not to mimic the @entity34
