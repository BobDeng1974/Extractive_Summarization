he said the huge queues at immigration gave ' a terrible impression of the @entity35 ' and it was unfortunate that the country ’s main port of entry was ' gaining such a poor reputation '			2

the home secretary is going to meet the @entity35 @entity79 ( @entity80 ) to discuss the steps @entity73 are taking			0

' asked whether the prime minister was confident @entity73 had sufficient manpower to process passengers at @entity9 , mr @entity4 's spokesman responded : ' it is not purely about staff numbers			1

but @entity158 , director of @entity73 operations at @entity9 , has told @entity75 that the leaflets are ‘ inappropriate ’ and that ministers would take ‘ a very dim view ’			0
in an email obtained by the @entity164 , he said : ‘ the leaflet ... is both inflammatory and likely to increase tensions in arrivals halls , especially in the current atmosphere			0
‘ it is inappropriate in that it is not for you to display how to complain on our behalf			0

’ in a joint statement issued last night , @entity73 and @entity75 said : ‘ the majority of passengers pass through immigration control quickly but there are sometimes delays at airports for a range of reasons			1
we think it ’s important passengers are given the full picture			2

’ @entity192 ’s immigration spokesman @entity217 said : ‘ the government is in danger of scoring an extraordinary double own goal , undermining our border security and giving a chaotic first impression of the @entity35			2
