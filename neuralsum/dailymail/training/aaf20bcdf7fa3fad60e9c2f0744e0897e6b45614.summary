he has been moving from city to city in @entity3 keeping his eyes and ears open for any attempt by @entity8 agents to assassinate him			1
but @entity10 , the elder half - brother of @entity8 's leader @entity11 , has daringly stepped out into the public gaze in @entity13 - and tucked into a dish of ' spag - bol ' in an @entity17 restaurant in @entity18			1
he even wrapped a burly arm around the chef 's shoulders as they posed for a photo , but the chef was so concerned about his own safety that he asked for his face to be obscured			2
@entity10 , the elder half - brother of @entity8 's leader @entity11 , poses for a photo with the chef of an @entity17 restaurant in @entity18 earlier this month @entity11 looked every part the aging playboy he is reputed to be as he brazenly grinned into the camera with his dangling sunglasses and straw hat			1
happy to shake off memories of bibimbap - a common @entity8 dish of rice , vegetables and occasionally eggs and meat - @entity11 is said to have consumed his @entity17 meal with great relish in the upmarket restaurant			1
the photo was acquired by @entity47 's @entity46 television network from a friend of @entity11 's			2
â€˜ despite reports that @entity10 's safety was in question following the execution of his uncle , @entity54 , he is still alive and well , ' said a source close to the family			1
' he 's living the same lavish lifestyle , moving around between @entity58 , @entity13 , @entity59 and @entity60			0
' he has been seen in the casinos of @entity62 and slipping into fine - dining restaurants throughout @entity3			2
but he is said to be aware that his life remains in constant danger because he criticised the @entity67 regime and he made sure he ' disappeared ' following the execution of @entity54 last december			2
another source claims that a @entity8 agent had tried to assassinate @entity10 in @entity62 in 2011 , but failed after a bloody shootout with his bodyguards			0
he fled to another city			0
since then , he has lived the life of a wandering playboy and when he visited the @entity17 restaurant - which is owned by a @entity78 businessman - he was accompanied by an attractive woman aged in her early 30s			1
@entity10 has been moving from city to city in @entity3 amid concerns of an assassination attempt by @entity8 agents until late 2011 , when his father - former leader @entity85 , who is also @entity11 's father by a different mother - was still alive , @entity10 shuffled back and forth between @entity87 and @entity62 , where his first and second wives lived			1
he is also known to have travelled to @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 , stopping in @entity92 , the @entity8 capital , from time to time			0
but following the death of his father he disappeared from view , fearing the purges being carried out by his younger half - brother			0
he has been able to live well , say @entity8 watchers , thanks to benefits from building projects and trading companies set up by his executed uncle @entity54			1
' it is possible that he believes he is not on the list of those to be purged by the current @entity8 regime , ' a source said			0
' this is why he has happily posed for a photo in an @entity13 restaurant			0
but he would not have gone back there a second time - just in case			0
' in fact , it is believed he has moved on from @entity18 since the picture was taken earlier this month			0
he is said to be still on his guard , worried that his playboy lifestyle might have infuriated his younger half - brother , who had been angered by the ' worldliness and womanising ' of @entity122			0
there is speculation that @entity87 is watching @entity10 's back for him , with a pencilled - in plan to install him as leader of @entity8 should the regime of @entity11 collapse .			1
