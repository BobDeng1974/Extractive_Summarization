he said : ' @entity9 ’s cut my hair for 19 years and has always avoided that area because he felt something			1
i thought it was scar tissue			2
' it took me a while to figure out where on earth the stitch had come from			2
' but later that night it hit me like a sledgehammer			0
i 've no idea how this stitch got missed			2
' i think @entity50 must have pulled the hair a bit further back , followed the scar up with his finger and noticed this bit of stitch poking out			1
