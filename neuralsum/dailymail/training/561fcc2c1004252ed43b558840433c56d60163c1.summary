by @entity1 reporter published : 09:27 est , 1 march 2014 updated : 13:03 est , 1 march 2014 concerns : evidence casts doubt on testimony that sentenced @entity7 to death newly discovered evidence has suggested that a @entity11 father executed ten years ago for killing his three daughters in an arson attack may have been innocent			1
@entity7 was sentenced to death in 1992 after being convicted of murder based on arson analysis , that was later discredited , and testimony from a jailhouse informant			1
but a note found in the case files suggests that the prosecutor may have concealed a deal with the informant , @entity24 , who claimed @entity7 had confessed to him			1
before @entity7 was executed in 2004 , a prosecutor argued that @entity24 's testimony was enough to prove his guilt , after the arson analysis was found to be sub-standard			1
in recent weeks however , lawyers seeking a posthumous pardon for @entity7 claim the inmate who provided testimony did so to gain a reduced sentence , the @entity29 reported			1
if that had proved to be the case in the lead up to @entity7 's execution , it could have been enough to clear him of guilt			1
' it 's astonishing that 10 years after @entity7 was executed we are still uncovering evidence showing what a grave injustice this case represents , ' @entity42 , co-director of the @entity43 , which is working on the case , said			1
@entity7 's case has been scrutinized by advocates who argue the state may have executed a wrongfully convicted man			1
fire science experts already have refuted much of the methodology used in his case			0
@entity24 and the trial prosecutor , @entity61 , have both denied any deal existed during @entity24 's testimony			0
doubt : new evidence suggests @entity7 , pictured here with one of his daughters , may have been wrongfully convicted crime scene : @entity7 was accused of killing his three children in a fire at this house in 1991 lawyers from @entity73 based @entity43 filed an official request to have @entity7 exonerated because of the discredited arson analysis and efforts to cut @entity24 's sentence			1
in november , one of the project 's lawyers , @entity81 , was going through files when he found a box of photocopies , which included a handwritten note on the inside of the district attorney 's folder			2
the note , which is not dated or signed , allegedly stated that @entity24 's charges were to be listed as a lighter robbery charge ' based on coop in @entity7 '			2
mr @entity81 described the discovery to the @entity29 as a ' rush of excitment ' , adding : ' this is what we 've been looking for			0
' mr @entity42 said the case has suggested a weakness in the justice system			0
if @entity104 € ™ s testimony ' was really based on a deal and misrepresentation , then the system can not be regulated ... you can not prevent the execution of an innocent person [ in those circumstances ]			0
' justice : @entity7 's cousin , @entity112 , holds up a photo of him playing with one of his children at a press conference in 2006 @entity61 , the prosecutor who later became a state district judge , has maintained that @entity24 did not receive leniency			2
he told the @entity119 on friday that he had not seen the note , but believed it was likely referring to efforts he made to get @entity123 out of prison after @entity7 's trial due to threats on @entity24 's safety			2
' the file may certainly reflect that we tried to get sentencing shortened , but it had nothing to do with any agreement relative to the @entity7 trial , ' @entity61 said			2
he said imprisoned members of the @entity134 had threatened @entity24 due to his role in @entity7 's conviction			0
' we certainly had an interest in not seeing a primary witness in the case killed while he was in prison , ' he said			0
the decision of whether to pardon @entity7 will rest with governor @entity142			0
@entity7 's family said if he was pardoned they would not press for damages			0
his cousin , @entity146 , added : ' we 're not asking for compensation , we 're asking for justice			0

@entity7 was executed in @entity11 in 2004
note discovered in case files suggests inmate who claimed @entity7 had confessed was given a reduced sentence in *return*
testimony was key evidence after arson analysis was discredited
