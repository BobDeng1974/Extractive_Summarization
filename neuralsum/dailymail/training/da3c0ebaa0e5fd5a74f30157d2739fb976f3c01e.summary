by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 won the second - highest prize in poker history last night , but his face gave no clue			1
the 23 - year - old poker sensation took home $ 15.3million when he beat out card - playing veteran @entity8 at the final table of the @entity10 for one drop tournament in @entity12 on tuesday			1
but after the final card secured his win , he kept his poker face on and refused to even grant interviews			2
five minutes after the victory , he left the @entity38 hotel with a handler telling a @entity41 reporter he had ' no interest in promoting poker '			0
@entity2 's behavior was quite a contrast to that of his competitor , @entity8 , who stayed on the stage for 30 minutes after the event to talk to reporters			0
he holds no ill - opinion of @entity2 for his behavior after the win though			1
' i respect it completely , ' @entity8 said of @entity2			0
' to each his own			0
if it â€™s not something he wants to do then i think we should all give him a break			0
' @entity2 's opponent @entity8 was much more livelier during the event , before @entity2 won no big deal : @entity2 pictured going all in on the last hand @entity8 certainly was n't grieving the loss too much , since placing second in the tournament earned him $ 8.3million - making him the new all - time winningest player with a $ 29.8million poker fortune			1
@entity2 's behavior should be understood considering the difference between professional poker players and athletes when it comes to tv			2
while athletes have tv contracts included in their pay , poker players do not and have to front their own entrance into tournaments - therefore getting nothing from a network like @entity82 televising their game or interview			0
it is also rumored that @entity2 may have only invested 10 per cent of his $ 1million entry into the tournament , meaning his actual winnings from tuesday are just $ 1.53million .			1

poker player @entity2 , 23 , won the @entity19 tournament in @entity12 on tuesday , but refused to get *emotional* about the victory
his $ 15.3million prize is the second - highest in poker history
