in the aftermath of sunday 's derby disaster the talk among fans was of summer incomings to reboot a blue machine that , all - of - a - sudden , looks as outdated as a @entity7			1
then there is the inevitable speculation over the future of under - fire manager @entity11			2
but the biggest challenge for @entity13 this summer could be keeping hold of something they already have			2
@entity13 risk losing star man @entity18 should they slip out of the @entity20 's top four @entity18 scores the first of his two goals during @entity13 's 4 - 2 defeat at the hands of rivals @entity24 it may have gone largely unnoticed in the carnage at @entity27 but there was an important landmark for the brilliant @entity18 that deserves to be recognised			1
the aftermath of a crushing derby defeat at the old enemy may not be the place for jelly and ice - cream but the @entity37 's tremendous feat of scoring 100 goals in just 158 appearances should be cause for celebration			1
take a minute to think where @entity13 would have been without that century			2
remember that title - winning goal against @entity45 in 2012 ? most , in that situation , would have put their foot through the ball as soon as it arrived from @entity51			0
the @entity37 forward clinched the @entity20 title for @entity13 with this striker against @entity45 in 2012 @entity18 wheels away in celebration after giving the @entity13 faithful inside the @entity58 a moment to remember not kun			1
the man who takes his nickname from a cartoon character had @entity13 fans believing in fairy tales when he feigned a shot to open up space before firing home probably the biggest goal in the club 's long history			1
that calm head , that powerful shot and that unnerving ability to find the target are what @entity13 paid what now looks like a bargain £ 38m for in 2011			2
@entity18 is settled in @entity78 and signed a new five - year deal only last august			0
however , he now has to think of himself			0
@entity18 scores past @entity24 goalkeeper @entity80 to earn his 19th @entity20 goal of the season the @entity13 players look dejected during the 4 - 2 defeat which left their side fourth in the @entity20 table if the unthinkable happens and @entity13 slip outside the top four will one of the best players in the world be happy at a season without showcasing his talents on the @entity94 stage ? there are admirers			1
@entity97 and @entity98 are both fans			1
should either register an interest city would face a desperate battle to keep hold of their star man			0
while a move to @entity97 may come with an enticing caveat in the shape of @entity109 , the loss of @entity18 would be exceptionally difficult to recover from			1
@entity11 signed former @entity111 striker @entity110 for £ 30million in january april 19 @entity112 ( @entity113 ) april 25 @entity114 ( @entity113 ) may 3 @entity115 ( a ) may 10 @entity45 ( @entity113 ) may 17 @entity111 ( a ) may 24 @entity116 ( @entity113 ) where else do you get those goals from ? while it is too early in his @entity13 career to pass judgement it would appear that the burden would be too much for @entity110 's broad shoulders			1
the former @entity111 man , who cost just £ 10m less than @entity18 , has failed to hit the ground running since his january move and has scored only once in five appearances			2
the powers - that - be would no doubt have to open their chequebook but who would come to an @entity135 ? and , should they sleepwalk out of the top four , who would dream of coming to a club without @entity94 football ? city are reportedly targeting @entity142 midfielder @entity141 as they look to strengthen this summer the likes of @entity141 and @entity144 are potential targets			0
@entity146 understands discussions have already taken place with a number of new additions			0
but will they also want to come to a club shorn of its idol ? it is a big question and one that @entity13 will be desperate not to have to discover the answer to			0
there are others to ponder			0
does @entity11 stay ? and what share of the blame do executives @entity158 and @entity160 take ? @entity11 's future as @entity13 boss is in doubt after a difficult 2014 - 15 campaign at the @entity58 are they at fault for spending the best part of £ 200m since 2012 without really strengthening the team or does @entity11 carry the can ? with @entity173 sanctions hurting , it was essential that @entity13 got bang for the buck			1
in reality they barely had a whimper			0
the pile on the in - tray on chairman @entity181 's desk seems to be getting taller every week			0
it is essential that keeping @entity18 is top of that ever - growing list or else that ageing blue machine risks heading for an even bigger crash .			0

@entity13 have slipped to fourth in the @entity20 table
@entity18 may look elsewhere should @entity13 continue to struggle
@entity37 striker has scored 19 @entity20 goals so far this season
@entity11 's future as @entity13 boss is also in doubt
@entity97 and @entity98 are both fans of the former @entity201 star
