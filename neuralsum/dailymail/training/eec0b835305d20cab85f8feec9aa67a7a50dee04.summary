by @entity1 reporter a @entity3 business owner left his vehicle in an amphitheater parking lot as he attended a hip - hop concert earlier this year			1
when he returned to the vehicle after the show , he found that his truck had been broken into and vandalized			2
it was n't until @entity11 found a note in his trashed vehicle outside the @entity14 in @entity15 that he discovered that it was n't your typical thief who 'd broken into and damaged his truck - it was the police			1
' sir , your car was checked by @entity21 k - 9 , ' the note left by police states			2
' the vehicle was searched for marijuana due to a strong odor coming from the passenger side of the vehicle			2
' fyi : after trashing @entity11 's vehicle , the @entity31 left him this note promotion : the truck the police trashed is n't just a vehicle for @entity11 , it 's advertising for his airhorn business after tearing through the vehicle and damaging much of the electrical wiring and cosmetics , the officers found precisely zero marijuana - or any other drugs , for that matter			1
as would be expected , @entity11 is not happy			2
' you think if anyone is going to break into your vehicle in @entity14 , the last person you think , it ’s going to be the cops , ' @entity11 tells @entity53			2
the officers who trashed the vehicle did n't even leave a business card or an apology - just a handwritten note on a 2x3 piece of scrap paper with a phone number written on it			0
@entity11 's vehicle is an over-sized truck with graphics on the side advertising his business , @entity67 , which sells automotive air - horns			1
damage : @entity11 shows how pieces of paneling were ripped off of the console on his truck paint : damage also was done to the truck 's paint job - before the officers realized there were no drugs in the vehicle ' disgusted , i ’ve got my whole life savings in this truck			1
it ’s like a marketing tool for my business to promote the air horns and everything			0
the horns were n’t working , all the electronics were ripped out , ' said @entity11			0
@entity11 is questioning the officers ' claims that his car smelled like marijuana - as he notes , the truck is lifted very high off the ground , where a k - 9 unit would have a hard time smelling			1
additionally , it was in the parking lot at a concert , where the smell of marijuana is often not an uncommon scent			1
' it was all sealed up , a parked vehicle in a private parking lot for a hip hop concert in @entity14			1
there were all kinds of smells , everywhere around here , ' said @entity11			0
@entity11 says he would have happily allowed the officers to search his vehicle , but says he 's upset that they trashed his truck , and did n't even ask for his permission , which - depending on who you ask - is potentially against the law			2
@entity120 : the wiring to the air horns @entity11 has hooked up to the truck were damaged in the officers ' search for non-existent marijuana questionable : @entity11 's truck is lifted more than three feet off the ground , which has him questioning how a dog was able to smell non-existent marijuana that could n't be reached by the animal 's nose ' it ’s an illegal search , ' @entity3 attorney @entity132 told the website			1
' usually if it ’s some kind of unoccupied vehicle there has to be some level of exigent circumstance to justify searching a vehicle without a search warrant			0
@entity142 could mean if there is a dead body inside , if there is a screaming child locked in the car , a dog but if the car is unoccupied there is no exigency to justify the search			0
' the @entity31 , however , defends its search of @entity11 's truck and says it was perfectly legal			1
' while the search is legal , it is not typical , ' the @entity21 said in an email to @entity157			0
' the @entity31 is now reviewing the specifics of this investigation			0
' in the meantime , @entity11 is still baffled about how something like this could even happen			0
' i am out for the damages and my time but mostly i ’m scratching my head and kind of confused with everything			0
i had no clue this was something that could happen , ' @entity11 said .			0
