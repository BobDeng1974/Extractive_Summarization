@entity0 believes that he has remained an integral part of @entity3 's success because of his work ethic , rather than any natural born talent			1
from @entity7 to @entity8 , all the coaches @entity0 has worked under during his four years at @entity3 have relied on his graft and discipline , and the @entity11 win over @entity12 on tuesday marked the @entity14 's 200th appearance			1
@entity3 have been in transition under @entity8 this season but the versatile @entity14 , who joined the club in 2010 , remains one of the first names on the team sheet and the side looked to his composure and leadership when their form stuttered early on			1
@entity0 has become a key figure for @entity3 since joining in 2010 @entity0 has come a long way since arriving in @entity28 with fellow countryman @entity29 at @entity30 @entity31 : 2010 - 11 @entity32 : 2010 - 11 , 2012 - 13 @entity11 : 2011 - 12 @entity33 : 2011 , 2013 @entity34 : 2011 @entity35 : 2011 real have a four - point lead over @entity3 but while they are away looking to extend their winning run to 22 matches in the final of the @entity35 this weekend , the @entity38 side can close the gap before the @entity43 break			1
' i 've always identified myself as a worker , ' @entity0 told the club website			2
' i am someone that perhaps was n't born with the same talent as other top players but i have always put in a lot of hard work and that has taken me to where i am now			0
' @entity3 is the biggest club that i have been at and to move here ( from @entity54 ) was the most important decision in my career as i arrived at the top			2
the demands of this club are the maximum that can be asked of a footballer			0
' pictured here with @entity62 , @entity0 excelled for @entity63 in this summer 's @entity35 @entity64 was brought in to boost the defensive line this season but in the important matches , it has either been the @entity69 or @entity70 that have played alongside @entity0			2
' i do n't give much importance to statistics but to reach 200 games for this club is not easy with the competition internal and external , ' @entity0 added			0
' all the time you are being tested because all players want to come here			0
i never would have imagined that i would play this number of games and it is due to the work			0
