' i deduced it was an indicator of how she felt rather that something she ever intended to do			0
' @entity1 in particular was n't very well and she shared with me some very dark thoughts which she had n't done before			1
' when people are going through trauma they sometimes feel helpless and one of the things they say is , " i wish i was n't here "			0
' one solution some people formulate is to take themselves away from it all			0
' to share that with anyone will often alarm or worry the people they live with so i think i was the only person @entity1 shared this with			2

' there were times when she felt so incensed by @entity13 and his friends , by which she meant his publishers , that she simply could n't get through each day with the panic and the anguish she felt			0
' these were things @entity1 told me when i spoke to her that she 'd recorded in her diary in september 2008			2
' he added : ' i remember @entity1 being further devastated by the content of the film			0
' the second traumatic reaction we have is sometimes more profound than the first one , more deep - seated , more entrenched and often more extreme			0
' they can be more difficult reactions to deal with			0
when i spoke to the family about the film this is what i found			0
' they were extremely angry and very disappointed and very frustrated			0
' it was broadcast on tv in @entity5 and the @entity16 felt there was little or no chance of @entity6 ever being found in @entity5			0
' mr @entity15 , a partner at a trauma after - care centre based in @entity159 , @entity160 , said the @entity16 viewed mr @entity13 's book as a ' gross breach of confidentiality ' because it showed he had been speaking to publishers while he and colleagues claimed laws on secrecy prevented them from discussing the @entity6 case with the couple			1

' one of the most devastating effects of the book was that the family were worried it would influence public opinion in @entity5 and people they would believe the book			0
' basically if people believed what was written in the book they were concerned people in @entity5 would stop looking for her			0
' even now @entity1 and @entity111 believe the most likely chance of finding @entity6 would originate from @entity5 and so the publication in their minds meant the finding of their daughter in @entity5 would be diminished			2
