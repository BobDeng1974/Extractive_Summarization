but none of the facilities seemed able to treat her illness , prompting her mother to accuse the @entity16 of ' leaving her to die '			1
but now miss @entity0 is on the road to recovery , planning her 21st birthday party and acting as a mentor to others with eating disorders			1

but doctors struggled to find her the appropriate way to help her - and her weight continued to drop to dangerous levels			0
in october 2012 , she was sectioned under the @entity53			0
this led to her being passed between six different hospitals for treatment - a move her mother @entity57 calls ' appalling '			1

' the @entity16 has got a lot to answer for			2
this is somebody 's life - but everyone seems to blame someone else			0

' the doctors told me that she was on the brink of death			0
' in june 2013 , when miss @entity0 was 19 and being treated at the @entity81 in @entity82 , she went into cardiac arrest			1

' no - one should technically be alive at three - and - a - half stone , ' her mother said			0
' @entity0 was so emaciated you could see every bone , and her teeth were protruding out of her mouth			2
' anorexia can lead to a life - threatening cardiac arrest because the heart needs adequate amounts of potassium , sodium and other electrolytes in a certain balance			1
miss @entity0 now wants to raise as much awareness to anorexia as possible , including posting this striking image of herself on @entity134 starving the body depletes these electrolyte and the electrical activity of the heart is interrupted , leading to heart rhythm problems or cardiac arrest			1

i have not been able to live a normal life			0
' i would say to those who are going through the same thing : you have to believe in yourself			0
