by @entity0 @entity1 believes @entity2 are an ‘ average side ’ and conceded he never thought his team stood any chance of winning the @entity5			1
the @entity11 star , speaking after his side ’s dramatic draw with the @entity9 , believes that to say his side are ' limited ' and that to say they are a top team would be a ' lie '			1
@entity2 are currently sit bottom of @entity16 with just a single point from two games , rescued by their dramatic late equaliser against the @entity9 when @entity1 crossed for team - mate @entity20 to convert			1
and even if the @entity9 do lose , it will take a big swing in goal difference for the @entity22 to qualify , after their 4 - 0 thumping at the hands of the @entity46 in their opening game			1
@entity1 said : ‘ maybe we ’re an average team			2
it would be a lie to say that we are a ‘ top ’ team			2
‘ we have many limitations and suffer from injuries such as with @entity54 ( who was suspended ) and ( @entity57 ) @entity56			2
this limits us a lot			0
limited : @entity2 were deprived of centre back @entity54 against @entity9 , following his rash sending off finished : and @entity56 , who was ruled out of the tournament after suffering an injury against @entity34 ‘ we have a very limited team and we are not at the best level			1
this does not enable you to beat top teams			0
‘ there are no miracles			0
we knew we would have a tough group , with perhaps teams better than us			0
i never thought we could be world champions , we have to be humble and know our level			0
‘ i ’m not a hypocrite , i never thought we could win the tournament			0

@entity1 believes that @entity2 never had a chance of winning @entity5
*provided* that assist for his side 's dramatic late equaliser against @entity9
@entity2 have one point from two games and are unlikely to qualify
@entity34 and @entity9 only need a draw in final game for both to go through
