@entity0 is determined to prove @entity2 ’ doubters wrong in the final weekend of the @entity3 and plans to celebrate the championship with a plastic cup after a silverware snub			1
with trophies being sent to @entity8 and @entity9 , @entity2 will return home from @entity11 empty handed even if they go on to win the three - horse race for the title			1
@entity15 ’s side need a thumping victory over @entity17 to overturn their points deficit on @entity19 and @entity20 and — despite the @entity21 keeping his counsel about the scenario — there is understood to be some disappointment about the organisers ’ trophy decision			1
@entity2 centre @entity0 is tackled by @entity20 lock @entity29 ( left ) and tighthead @entity30 ‘ i ’m sure we ’ll find a trophy somewhere , like a plastic cup or something , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ obviously people are doubting us and they do n’t think we ’re going to be involved			2
but we just worry about ourselves , concentrate on ourselves , and will put a performance together that hopefully means we can get the cup on sunday			0
’ @entity40 hopes of a landslide victory could hinge on the fitness of @entity17 no 8 @entity43 , who has a ‘ 30 - 40 per cent chance ’ of being fit			1
@entity17 have delayed their team announcement by 24 hours to give him time to recover , but @entity0 says @entity2 will not change their approach even if the 31 - year - old is ruled out			1
@entity50 is congratulated by @entity0 and @entity51 following his crucial try against @entity20 ‘ we ca n’t fall into that trap , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ if you do , the pressure seems to come on you rather than the opposition			0
‘ @entity17 have some key injuries with the captain maybe being out , and after the disappointment of @entity60 , they ’ll have doubt in their minds			2
‘ it ’s about us going out there and stamping our authority			0
it ’s about sealing that doubt and building from there			0
’ while @entity17 are struggling for form , @entity2 are still building momentum after their victory over @entity20			1
a fine defensive display kept the championship race alive , however @entity0 knows his side must add more cutting edge in attack			2
@entity15 's side are in a three - horse race for the @entity3 title that will be decided on saturday ‘ looking back on the @entity20 game , we probably left two or three scoring opportunities out there , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ this week we ’re going to have to take all our chances			0
‘ as a back line we have n’t fired as we ’d have wanted to			0
the forwards have worked tirelessly all campaign for us and there ’s pressure on the backs now to take opportunities			0
’ if @entity2 can rack up the points , the pressure will move on to @entity20 and @entity19 , who are up second and third against @entity94 and @entity60 in the afternoon of staggered fixtures			1
@entity0 and his countrymen will watch events unfold from @entity11 and he plans to cheer on his @entity99 clubmates from @entity100			0
@entity17 's captain and talisman @entity43 faces a race to fit for the visit of @entity2 on saturday ‘ @entity60 can be amazing at times , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ hopefully , they can turn up and do a job			0
they ’ve done it in the past			0
’ aside from two injury - enforced changes in the front row , @entity15 has kept faith with the starting xv who beat @entity20			1
@entity50 scored the decisive try and the centre was on wednesday among the latest batch of players — along with @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 — to sign a dual contract with the @entity123 and their region			0
‘ @entity119 , @entity51 , @entity50 and @entity121 represent a cross-section of experience			0
each one of them is a player of proven talent , ’ said @entity15 .			2
