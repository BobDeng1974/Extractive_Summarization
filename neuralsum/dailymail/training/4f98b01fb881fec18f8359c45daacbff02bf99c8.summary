they have been touted by some as the cheap and eco-friendly future of energy			0
but many of @entity7 ’s solar panels are not actually generating as much power as they could – because they are facing the wrong way , an expert has warned			1
angling solar panels in an alternating east and west - facing formation , rather than in rows facing directly towards the south , would actually increase the amount of electricity generated overall			1
this house , built in the thirties , has a solar panel heating system across the roof ( file photo ) such a formation means they do not need to be spaced out , as there would be a reduction in shadow			0
this allows them to be active for a longer period each day			0
it would also cut the risk of disruption to the @entity33 , says @entity34 , of @entity35 , who is working on a @entity7 - wide project aiming to answer a number of questions relating to the production of energy through solar panels			1
in solar farms or industrial premises with swathes of solar panels , they are broadly positioned to face south following the logic that they will pick up the most sunlight			2
however , the shadows they cast means the panel behind ca n’t be too close together			0
video courtesy of eco experts a single east - west panel produces slightly less electricity than single south - facing one , twice as many panels can be packed in the same space as @entity7 ’s use of solar power increases , this could lead to disruption to the grid			1
plus , excess energy that can not be stored will be wasted professor @entity34 , an expert in solar technology , said that laying them flatter and angling them so that they face east and west alternately would cut the amount of shading and so allow them to be put more closely together			1
and while it is true a single east or west - facing panel produces slightly less electricity than a single south - facing one , around twice as many panels can be packed in the same space			2
even when the cost of installing the extra panels is taken into account , savings will be made in the long run			0
professor @entity34 admits that his theory is not easily adopted by householders who install solar panels as they can not change the shape of their roof			1
nearly half a million @entity7 homes have solar panels and the typical family saves an estimated £ 800 a year due to cheaper energy bills and green subsidies			1
but professor @entity34 does suggest that , where possible , homeowners should take advantage of panels that face east and west			2
speaking on @entity94 , he said that south - facing panels generate the most electricity in the afternoon when the sun is at its highest – but this is when householders are out at work and can not use all the power generated			2
while some can be stored in batteries , much of the excess electricity is fed back into the national grid			0
and as @entity7 ’s use of solar power increases , this could even lead to disruption to the grid			0
however , he would like to see a ‘ smart subsidy ’ introduced that would incentivise owners of large - scale solar farms to angle their panels differently			0
@entity117 , of the @entity118 , said householders should not worry as the difference in electricity generated by south , east and west - facing panels is small			1
however , large - scale installations could benefit from installing a combination of panels .			0
