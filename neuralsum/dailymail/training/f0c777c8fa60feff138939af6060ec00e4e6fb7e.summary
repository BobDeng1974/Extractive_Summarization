a teenager told she had range of ailments from a slipped disc to damaged ligaments was horrified when doctors realised she actually had cancer			2
@entity7 , 15 , had been in agony for months before her devastating diagnosis of @entity11 's sarcoma , a rare but deadly form of bone cancer that affects young people			1
by the time she was diagnosed , the cancer had spread to her spine , womb , bladder , bowel and pelvis			1
@entity7 ( left before her diagnosis and right , after treatment ) suffered pains in her legs for months - and was diagnosed with a slipped disc and ligament damage before the devastating news she had rare bone cancer by the time she was diagnosed , the cancer had spread to her spine , womb , bladder , bowel and pelvis			1
@entity7 is pictured with her sister @entity42 ( left ) and mother @entity44 ( right ) but teenager , from @entity46 , @entity47 , says she is determined not to be beaten by the disease - and has just shown a remarkable response to treatment and a new drug			1
she told the @entity52 : ' when they told me i had cancer it was a relief because at least they knew what it was and they could start to believe me , as i was in pain for so long			2
' in the six months since she was diagnosed , @entity7 has endured seven rounds of life - saving surgery and been given more than 60 pints of blood			1
however she has already defied doctors ' expectations by being active just weeks after gruelling treatment			0
doctors had warned it was so intensive that @entity7 would need a wheelchair for two years			1
she has also lost her hair due to the drugs			0
@entity11 's sarcoma is a rare bone and tissue cancer			1
it can occur any time during childhood and young adulthood , and rarely affects older people			0
the tumour can develop anywhere in the body , but is usually found in the long bones of the arms and legs , the pelvis , or the chest			1
it often spreads to the lungs and other bones			0
there are few symptoms , but the most common is pain , and occasionally swelling , at the site of the tumour			0
treatment involves a combination of chemotherapy , radiation therapy , and surgery			2
the five - year survival for localised disease is 70 per cent to 80 per cent when treated with chemotherapy			2
despite being back on her feet , she is expected to need hip replacement surgery in three years , due to bone damage from the treatment			2
however it does mean the tumour has already shrunk by more than half - and just days after finishing six months of treatment in hospital , @entity7 has returned to school			1
she told the @entity52 she now ca n't wait to go on holiday with her family and swim with dolphins - and also wants to take up kick boxing			2
her mother @entity44 , 36 , said : ' she never lets anything get her down			0
' even when she lost all her hair she said , " oh well , it will save me having to do it in the mornings "			0
she always looks on the positive side of everything			0
the teenager 's ordeal began when she got pains in her leg last november			1
they became so excruciating she would beg her mother for a hot bath in the middle of the night to ease the pain			0
over the next six months , her mother took her to the @entity133 , where she was given diagnoses ranging from a slipped disc to damaged ligaments			2
it took until she could barely walk for the condition to be taken seriously			0
after going to @entity139 in @entity140 , while visiting her father , @entity7 was given an x-ray and then an mri scan			1
to the family 's horror , this revealed there was a tumour pressing against her sciatic nerve , which runs down the leg from the buttock			0
in the six months since she was diagnosed , @entity7 has had seven rounds of life - saving surgery and been given more than 60 pints of blood it is hoped that @entity7 , with older sister , @entity42 ( left ) , will finish treatment before her 16th birthday in march by the next day , she had been admitted to a cancer unit in @entity161 , where she underwent nine rounds of chemotherapy at @entity161 's @entity164 and six weeks of radiotherapy at the city 's @entity166			1

six months on , her mother said : ' never in a million years did we think she had anything like that			0
it 's great to have her home			0
' it is hoped @entity7 , who has an older sister , @entity42 , will finish treatment before her 16th birthday in march			1
