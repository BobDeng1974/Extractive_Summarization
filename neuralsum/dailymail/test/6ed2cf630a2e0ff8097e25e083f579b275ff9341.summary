as @entity2 ’s supporters settled in for a few pints at the @entity5 pub in the centre of @entity7 on tuesday afternoon , a sizeable number spilled on to the street outside to sing the latest @entity10 song			1
‘ * * * * the @entity12 , ’ it goes — and it really does go on , and on and on			1
inside the @entity17 , with 2,000 travelling @entity2 fans seated in the curva at the north west area , there was more of the same			1
@entity2 fans sang @entity10 songs during tuesday 's friendly draw with @entity21 at the @entity17 - there is no suggestion that the fans pictured in this image where involved in the chants @entity27 ( centre ) and the rest of the @entity2 squad applaud the travelling support in @entity7 on tuesday frankly , it is embarrassing to listen to - a stain on our usually good - natured and good - humoured travelling supporters as we look ahead to june ’s friendly with the @entity36 in @entity37			1
it also places a strain on the @entity40			0
what can they do when thousands of travelling fans are singing : ‘ where were you in @entity46 , ’ or the @entity48 bomber song that has been heard for many years on our overseas trips ? toe - curling stuff			0
as for the @entity12 songs , many of the younger fans who join in with these chants can not know or understand the significance of the @entity58 political situation and how it affected @entity59 through the @entity60 , seventies and @entity62			1
in @entity37 there will be the issue of provocation , the potential to engage with a city that has traditionally been a political @entity68 is barely time to catch our breath before @entity2 ’s 3,000 supporters head to the @entity72 for the first fixture against the @entity36 since 1995			1
it was at @entity75 on february 15 that year when rioting @entity2 fans - many of them associated with the neo-nazi group @entity77 - caused the fixture with @entity80 ’s side to be abandoned			1
@entity2 supporters throw missiles at @entity75 20 years ago , causing the fixture to be abandoned in the intervening years there have been various conversations between the @entity40 and the @entity86 about a fixture between the teams , but it is only now they can agree that the time is right			2
let ’s not spoil it			0
the fixture with @entity96 ’s labouring team on june 7 is a bookend to the season ahead of the final chapter in @entity100 seven days later			0
@entity101 is a football man and you can tell by his pained expression at the end of every post-match briefing that he would rather not be answering questions about fans ’ behaviour			0
‘ we can only hope that in some way we put that right before we go to @entity58 because the last thing we want is anything ( other ) than a very good football match , ’ he said after the 1 - 1 draw with @entity21			0
this is an awkward situation for the @entity40 and yesterday they were reluctant to release another statement condemning the @entity10 chanting as there is no evidence that it has had a positive effect			2
it seems by @entity101 's pained expression at the end of post-match briefings that the @entity2 boss would rather not be ansering questions about fans ' behaviour the first audible chants of this latest song can be traced back to @entity131 in november , when @entity2 emerged with an uplifting 3 - 1 victory over @entity133			1
that was until @entity101 , underprepared for a question about the nature of the chants , answered one with some assistance from a diplomatic member of the @entity40 ’s communications team			2
the @entity40 attempted to defuse the situation by releasing a statement the following day apologising for the behaviour of ‘ a section of the @entity2 support ’			2
it read : ‘ we have consistently urged supporters to show respect and not to chant songs that could be regarded as insulting to others - particularly from a religious or political perspective			0
’ the songs were sung in @entity2 's win against @entity133 and the @entity40 wanted to make sure they stopped in @entity7 - there is no suggestion that the fans pictured in this image where involved in the chants the @entity40 are in a tricky position because they are getting hammered by the travelling fans at every away game for the ‘ two caps for @entity165 ’ loyalty scheme			1
previously , those who travelled to watch @entity2 were rewarded with double the ‘ caps ’ , giving greater access to restricted - allocation @entity169 and @entity171 tickets			0
now , fans who attend home games get twice the points instead			0
the @entity40 would do well to take a closer look at this policy in an effort to placate the supporters			0
is it a fair trade ? probably not , but then it is n’t equitable to inflict @entity10 songs on the people of @entity58 the day before kick - off at the @entity72 , either .			2
