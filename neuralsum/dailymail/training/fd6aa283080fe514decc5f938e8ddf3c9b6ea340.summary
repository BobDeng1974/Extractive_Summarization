@entity0 celebrated his first goal in a @entity3 shirt as @entity5 's men eased to victory in their pre-season friendly against @entity9 side @entity8			1
@entity10 supplied @entity11 for the first after three minutes			1
the @entity14 striker was later involved in a heated exchange with @entity8 captain @entity16			2
but he composed himself to lay on a second - half assist for @entity18			1
host commentator it 's all over in @entity21 as @entity3 win the game 3 - 1 thanks to goals from @entity11 , @entity0 and @entity18			1
@entity10 stood out once again as he bagged two assists while @entity26 laid down a marker as @entity28 watched on			2
@entity0 will be pleased to get off the mark in a blue shirt after a delightful 25 - yard free - kick put the @entity32 2 - 0 ahead in the first half			1
and the home side have a late consolation goal as @entity36 finds space in the box to head past @entity39			0
84mins : @entity40 is still toiling away at the top , but ca n't get onto a through ball from @entity43			0
the @entity3 youngsters are on now and have been keeping the ball well			2
six minutes to play ! 81mins : that ends a brilliant night for @entity10 , who had a hand in all three goals - setting up two and winning the free - kick which @entity0 hit home			1
79mins : more changes for @entity3 as @entity10 , @entity52 and @entity18 make way for @entity43 , @entity54 and @entity55			1
@entity0 has also left the field and @entity57 gets in on the action and now @entity18 has his first goal in a @entity3 shirt after another brilliant bit of play from @entity10			1
@entity8 's defence was nowhere to be seen as @entity10 burst through before laying the ball off to his right for @entity18 to do the rest			1
72mins : @entity67 is getting some ( hopefully ) precautionary treatment on the right knee that he injured so badly last season			0
should n't be anything to worry about for @entity3 fans			2
@entity73 : on comes the wonderfully named @entity74 , who has just signed for @entity8 after a trial			2
@entity74 is from @entity76 , a country which once had a tennis player called @entity78 ( he was n’t )			0
66mins : former @entity8 star @entity67 makes way for @entity80			2
the @entity9 youngster gets a huge reception from the home fans the @entity9 side have rung the change now as both @entity3 loanees , @entity87 and @entity88 , leave the field			1
61mins : @entity90 hits the crossbar for @entity8 with a spectacular 30 - yard effort from out in the left wing			1
@entity26 , who has been brilliant , could have done nothing about that strike			0
58mins : @entity10 should have just put @entity3 into a 3 - 0 after running through on goal , but substitute keeper @entity97 was equal to his left - footed strike			1
the ball rebounded back out to @entity40 who could n't quite turn the ball back towards goal			0
55mins : @entity10 has moved over to the left in what seems to be a move to get @entity40 into the game and give the @entity107 a chance to shine in his rightful position			2
@entity10 , however , is still seeing more of the ball as he chests down yet another crossfield pass from @entity112			2
54mins : @entity5 calls to @entity3 midfielder and says , ' @entity18 , control the ball ' as he demands that his side start to dictate play once again			1
50mins : there was a counter-attack on for @entity3 as @entity40 galloped forward but the striker over-hit his pass to @entity11 and the chance was missed			2
@entity73 : @entity121 reappeared after half time with a baseball cap on back to front saying ‘ sorry i ’m fresh ’			0
we 're back underway in @entity21 as @entity3 go on the attack with @entity40			2
that 's right ... he is playing ! the attack comes to nothing as the @entity107 is blocked			0
no wholesale changes for @entity3 , but @entity132 will come on in place of @entity134 meaning @entity135 will go out to left - back for the second half			1
@entity73 : the close relationship between these clubs is the subject of much conjecture but this has been pretty competitive and there could have been more goals			0
@entity11 could have scored a hat - rick but has faded after a bright start , torres anonymous			0
player who has caught the eye from @entity8 is attacking midfielder @entity149			2
you doubt this will stay 2 - 0			0
and that 's the end of the first half as it ends 2 - 0 to the @entity32			2
@entity3 have been excellent going forward as goals from @entity156 and @entity0 put @entity5 's side in the driving seat			1
44mins : @entity3 loanee @entity88 goes down after a tackle from @entity134 , but there was no foul there			2
the @entity164 defender grabbed his face as he feigned injury for @entity8			2
that 's not the right way to impress @entity5			0
41mins : @entity26 saves again			0
this time from a @entity170 free - kick			1
the @entity32 stopper does n't seem in the mood to let any goals in this evening			0
particularly with @entity28 waiting in the wings ... 37mins : @entity26 is forced into another save with as @entity149 goes through on goal			0
the @entity32 skipper sticks out a left leg to keep the score at 2 - 0			0
@entity73 : if i was @entity5 looking at my two loanees to @entity8 i would be much more impressed so far with @entity87 , who has looked pretty lively , than with @entity88			0
the @entity164 , playing wing back , has been caught out of positioin a couple of times and has not made much happen down the right			0
but it ca n’t be an easy game for either			0
33mins : that second @entity3 came after some brilliant work by @entity10 as he ran through the @entity8 defence before being fouled			1
the @entity164 - born striker showed another glimpse of what he 's all about			0
@entity193 , power and aggression			0
three things that @entity3 fans have been missing since the departure of a certain @entity121			0
@entity73 : that was nearly a severe embarrassment for @entity26 , who had looked rock solid up until that botched clearance			0
the crowd , which is [ probably more like 20,000 after a late influx , have got defalted after @entity8 looked far more composed following the shaky start			0
friendly or not , one thing pretty evident already is that @entity10 is not someone to be messed with			1
and @entity0 curls the resulting free - kick home from 25 - yards			1
he has his first goal in a @entity3 shirt and what a way to start ! 20mins : the game has settled down now as @entity8 go on the attack with @entity215 , but @entity52 is there to clear the danger			1
at the other end , @entity10 has got into a bit of a scrap after being fouled just outside the @entity8 box			1
it may be a pre-season friendly , but you would n't want to argue with the @entity3 striker ... 15mins : @entity8 seemed to be causing their own problems here as they insist on playing the ball around the back and forcing the passes back to their goalkeeper room			1
@entity18 has started brilliantly , breaking up play and laying on the ball for @entity10 for the first goal			1
11mins : it 's been a brilliant start from @entity3 as they continue to press @entity8 after scoring the early goal			1
as i write though , @entity215 has just forced @entity32 keeper @entity26 into a brilliant save			0
the @entity240 found space and struck a powerful effort with his right foot which @entity26 was equal to			0
@entity28 , who is in the @entity3 dugout , will have enjoyed that one			0
@entity73 : the smoke from the flares at the start barely had time to clear before that notably unselfish bit of play from @entity10 to put @entity11 in and the @entity251 nearly added to it a minute later			0
not much sign of @entity8 from the home defenders so far			0
@entity3 are in the lead after just four minutes as @entity10 runs through on goal before sliding the ball to the onrushing @entity11 who taps into an empty net			1
we 're underway at the @entity262 as @entity3 start with the ball			0
@entity73 : slightly surreal start to the evening as the stewardess in the press area asks me if i am the bloke who presents @entity269 back in @entity270 ( i am not )			0
a pleasant evening in the @entity271 with a cluster of about 250 @entity3 fans in their own corner			0
quite a smattering of @entity3 fans all over the ground , reinforcing the close relationship between these two clubs			0
the @entity262 is a nicely appointed stadium seating 26,000 but looks like it will be about 10,000 short of capacity tonight			0
@entity3 look set to offload @entity284 striker @entity283 for a fee of £ 25million			0
the striker had been expected to join up with @entity5 's side on wednesday afternoon but he is now flying to @entity270 from @entity284 to seal a five - year , £ 75,000 - a - week deal with the @entity289			2
click here to read more ... so , @entity3 boss @entity5 has opted to start with both @entity40 and @entity10 in the @entity32 line - up			1
@entity3 's £ 32m signing @entity10 will be hoping to add to his impressive start in a blue shirt which saw him bag a goal on his non-competitive debut			1
tonight 's clash comes too soon for @entity121 to make his second @entity3 debut as the @entity298 has just two days of training under his belt but @entity32 fans will be able to catch another glimpse of new signings @entity10 , @entity0 and @entity134			1
