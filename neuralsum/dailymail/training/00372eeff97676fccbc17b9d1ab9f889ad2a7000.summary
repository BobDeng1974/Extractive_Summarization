by @entity0 published : 11:40 est , 14 september 2013 updated : 11:27 est , 15 september 2013 @entity2 minister @entity1 told colleagues today they could not be ' half in , half out ' of the coalition government @entity7 are courting electoral disaster by disowning government policies such as cutting the welfare bill and scrapping @entity12 ’s 50p tax rate , a senior party figure warned today			1
@entity2 minister @entity1 tells senior colleagues who are scrambling to distance themselves from the @entity14 ahead of the 2015 general election that they can not be ‘ half in , half out ’ of @entity17 claimed that if there were only two choices at the election – the coalition government and the @entity22 – ‘ the coalition government would win and would deserve to win ’			1
mr @entity1 told the @entity23 his party would ‘ lapse into the opposition comfort zone ’ if it started echoing @entity12 criticisms of a £ 26,000 - a - year cap on family benefits , the reduction of the top rate of tax to 45p and the increase in @entity33 fear @entity7 activists at the party ’s annual conference , which starts this weekend in @entity37 , are set to rebel against key government policies and may vote to reinstate the 50p rate introduced by @entity12 weeks before it lost power in 2010			1
‘ the fundamental question for @entity7 gathering for conference is this : are we proud of our government or ashamed of it ? ’ mr @entity48 remarks will be seen as a rebuke to colleagues on the @entity51 of the party – including business secretary @entity53 and president @entity54 – who have begun to complain publicly about coalition @entity56 ministers suspect both mr @entity53 and mr @entity54 are flirting with @entity12 in preparation for a potential @entity60 power - sharing pact after the next election			1
but @entity7 on the @entity62 of the party are warning privately that to go straight into coalition with @entity12 , following five years of sharing power with the @entity14 , would be seen as deeply unprincipled by many voters			1
mr @entity1 , a close ally of deputy prime minister @entity67 , said the coalition had been formed in 2010 when @entity68 was in ‘ deep trouble ’ and @entity12 had been borrowing a ‘ ruinous ’ £ 450 million a @entity71 country also faced serious problems thanks to ‘ entrenched intergenerational poverty and welfare dependency ’ and school standards that had been allowed to fall behind those of international competitors			1
‘ @entity68 badly needed stable government and a clear - headed economic recovery plan			0
and - with the @entity7 entering office as part of the coalition government - that is what we got , ’ the minister added.now the country was ‘ part of the way down the road to recovery ’ with the economy ‘ off its knees and back on its feet ’ and the deficit cut by a third , he said			1
interest rates have been kept low for homeowners and businesses and more than a million jobs had been created in the private sector			0
at the same time , more than 20 million workers on middle incomes had had their income tax cut as the amount that can be earned tax free has been increased in stages towards £ 10,000			0
‘ these are all @entity7 successes just as much as conservative successes			2
we have stuck with determination to the policies that have made this progress possible , ’ mr @entity1 said			2
‘ and the @entity7 have taken the lead in @entity45 on policies to help people with the cost of living			2
@entity116 of millions of workers on middle and low earnings have had their income tax cut			0
millions of retired people have seen the state pension rise by more than inflation			0
mr @entity1 told the @entity23 his party would ¿ lapse into the opposition comfort zone ¿ if it started echoing @entity12 criticisms of a £ 26,000 - a - year cap on family benefits ‘ but the @entity7 have not just made the popular decisions			1
not everyone likes the cap on welfare , or reductions in military spending , or the rise in vat to help tackle @entity68 's debt mountain , but we have supported these policies too			2
‘ we have been willing at all stages to make the necessary but tougher decisions as well			0
we have voted through the changes that @entity68 needed to start on the road to recovery			0
‘ so @entity7 have taken the difficult but correct decisions over the last three - and - a - half years , but now , with the general election approaching , we also need to win the credit we deserve for turning round our country			1
‘ that means @entity7 embracing our role in @entity45 and being proud of our overall record			2
we can not be half in @entity45 and half out			0
we can not claim credit for the popular policies but pretend the unpopular policies are nothing to do with us			0
‘ we can not be in the government but campaign against the government at the same time			0
we can not lapse into the opposition comfort zone of echoing @entity12 's policies on 50p tax rates and welfare reform			1
‘ the @entity7 conference is an opportunity to trumpet our achievements , not to amplify the attacks of our critics			1
’ mr @entity1 , tipped as a potential candidate in a future @entity7 leadership race , said the party ’s objective in coalition should be ‘ to be a more effective governing party than the @entity14 , not a more effective opposition party than @entity12 ’			1
‘ it is our government and we need to own it and celebrate it			0
if @entity7 run down the achievements of this government we will not deserve to share in the credit for the government 's achievements , ’ he added			2
‘ the economic recovery , sticking to @entity188 , the new jobs , cutting the deficit , our national renewal - none of these would have been possible without the @entity7			0
we have been fundamental to putting our country back on track			0
’ mr @entity1 said that as an independent party , it was right for the @entity7 to stand on its own manifesto			1
‘ but we will only get the credit for our achievements if we unambiguously stand by our record in @entity45 - no foot dragging , no craving the easy gesture politics of opposition , no fence sitting , ’ he added .			0

@entity1 warned colleagues could not be ' half in , half out ' of coalition
