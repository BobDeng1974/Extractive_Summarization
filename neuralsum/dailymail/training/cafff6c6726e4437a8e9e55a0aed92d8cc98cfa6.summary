by @entity0 published : 14:56 est , 8 june 2012 updated : 16:27 est , 8 june 2012 thousands of cushions handmade as gifts for @entity4 athletes may go to waste after @entity5 organisers told volunteers they ca n’t hand them out			1
the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) initially told volunteers from the @entity10 project that they could present the 5,000 cushions they had created as souvenirs for the stars			1
but now , in apparent fear of angering commercial sponsors , they have reneged on the deal			1
support : @entity19 's heptathlete @entity18 has championed the cushions , but will not be able to receive one due to red tape dedicated families and elderly and disabled members of the scheme have worked since early last year to create the individually crafted presents			1
but plans for a stand in the @entity28 to distribute the cushions were quashed because the space was needed for sponsors			1
they were then told in february there would be no direct access to give athletes the items or delegates of @entity38 who had also voiced an interest in receiving a gift			0
project leader @entity42 , 53 , said many people would be left outraged if their creations never reached the athletes they were designed for			0
she said : ' it should n’t have been reduced to this			0
it means so much to the people who make the cushions			0
families , elderly and disabled members of the @entity10 volunteer scheme have spent months making the @entity55 - themed cushions for athletes ' the elderly , disabled and people in care homes are among them			1
they feel this is their link with the @entity4 even if some are not able to get to @entity62 themselves			0
' a mum with three children in @entity66 said there was no way she could afford to take her family to the games but that creating a cushion each would be their contribution			0
' changes to distribution plans that have been imposed on us by @entity8 are very frustrating , and have caused us great difficulties in our planning			0
' the decisions that have been made have n’t made sense at all and i ’m still perplexed about the needs of commercial sponsors being repeatedly raised			0
' @entity83 , left , 1,500m athlete said she thought the cushions were ' really original ' and compared far more favourably to the @entity86 ' keyring , and @entity87 , right , 800m and 400m relay also supports them @entity90 : @entity91 ( freestyle skiing ) , @entity93 , right , ( cross country skiing ) and @entity95 , left ( biathlon ) are lucky ones to already have received their cushions she continued : ' i ’m saddened that so much that is great , exciting and wonderful about the @entity101 has been reduced to a stream of increasingly restrictive emails			0
' the bouncy cushions were initially coined as perfect gifts as they would not take up considerable room in athletes ’ cases packing after the games and weigh just 300 grams			1
it was hoped the personal gift would be given to as many @entity55 and @entity113 athletes as possible			1
but after losing the stand in june last year , when 4,000 had already been made , the group feel efforts to distribute them were discarded completely			2
@entity117 , left , 400m rowing and @entity119 , right , high jump , were also fans of the unique gifts the project was then presented to @entity124 , the @entity125 which represents athletes at the games , spearheaded by former @entity131 @entity130 triple jumper @entity128			2
he presented @entity10 to the delegates of all the @entity38 and @entity134 of which a third were very interested or wanted their athletes to have cushions			2
plans to distribute them were then scrapped in october and to the athletes completely in february this year			0
@entity42 said : ' i do n’t exactly know why the @entity10 project has been placed in such a difficult situation			0
the means to deliver the gifts steadily eroded dedication : volunteer @entity146 from @entity147 , @entity145 helped hand make thousands of cushions as gifts for @entity4 athletes ' over the winter we focused on trying to use the regional training camps as the most appropriate way to get cushions to the athletes who wanted one			1
' despite the efforts our co-ordinator was making , the rules about giving gifts to athletes became more and more restrictive			1
' it took until january for @entity8 to confirm that there would then be no arrangements for access or contact to distribute the cushions to athletes			2
' it has been frustrating to have one after another agreed plan brought to an end by or through @entity8			0
' we know how much the athletes love the cushions and want to have them , we will persevere and find ways meet their requests			2
' volunteers @entity146 , right , and @entity179 , left , fear thousands of cushions handmade as gifts for @entity4 athletes may go to waste the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) has now said the space to hand out the cushions in the olympic park has been allocated to commercial sponsors @entity8 officially cited logistical reasons for deciding to not to continue with the project			1
a @entity5 spokesperson said : ' the @entity190 mark was granted to over 2,700 projects across the @entity131 to enable the projects an official association with the @entity55 and @entity113			2
' this gives those projects the opportunity to profile themselves as part of the @entity101			0
' in this case the @entity198 was presented with a number of options of gifts that can be officially distributed to athletes at the @entity101 and decided not to proceed with offering the cushions to all athletes for a number of logistical reasons			1
' we think the @entity10 cushions are great and are happy that they are available to athletes from around the world on request			2

volunteers have spent months *knitting* and *sewing* @entity55 - themed cushions as gifts for athletes
they fear their efforts will go to waste as they have no way of handing out their 5,000 cushions
their stand in olympic park has been given to sponsors
cushions were handmade by elderly , disabled and family members
