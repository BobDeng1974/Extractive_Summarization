lost : @entity0 , 50 , has been ordered to pay back £ 1 million in unpaid cheques that she used to buy gambling chips in @entity5 's @entity4 casino an ‘ unimaginably rich ’ @entity7 heiress who lost £ 2million in one night of gambling at @entity9 was yesterday chastised by a judge , who ordered her to pay everything she owed			1
@entity0 , 47 , tried to sue the @entity13 casino for encouraging her to keep spending , claiming staff ‘ took advantage of her gambling addiction ’			0
but at the @entity19 yesterday , judge @entity18 threw out the case , saying she was fully responsible for her actions			2
he said the loss was no catastrophe for the @entity26 politician ’s wife , who once had £ 6million transferred into her account over a period of just ten days after claiming she ‘ needed it to pay for the kids ’			2
two months after her losses in @entity5 , she and her family lost another £ 3million in @entity34			1
‘ mrs @entity36 is a person of wealth unimaginable to the ordinary person and , i suspect , to many of moderate or substantial wealth , ’ the judge said			1
‘ the enormous sums she gambled and the enormous losses she sustained were within her means			0
’ mrs @entity36 – who is the daughter of a wealthy @entity7 and is married to @entity47 foreign minister @entity46 – had built up a reputation for spending huge amounts in casinos before arriving at @entity9 on april 3 , 2012			1
within hours , she reached her £ 1.7million cheque limit playing card game punto banco – a type of baccarat			0
at her request , the limit was then extended to £ 2million , which she lost while also giving out £ 14,000 in tips to the dealer and other staff			2
but some of the cheques she issued were not honoured , and @entity9 took her to court to claim £ 1million in unpaid debts			0
mrs @entity36 , known as ‘ @entity65 ’ , subsequently launched a counter-claim , arguing that staff wrongly allowed her to gamble on credit			1
she claimed she should be given back the £ 1million that she had already paid to @entity9			2
she argued that she had been a ‘ vulnerable ’ gambling addict since 1999 , and said casino staff ‘ positively encouraged ’ her to keep playing when she was in no fit state to continue			0
‘ i refused to deal with the thought that i was a gambler and , for that matter , a high roller , ’ she told the court			0
‘ i always felt that i was in control and could stop whenever i wanted to ... i needed someone that night to tell me to stop playing and bring me to my senses			0
’ yesterday , judge @entity18 exonerated @entity9 , saying mrs @entity36 had given no sign that her gambling was out of control			1
the court heard they have a fortune from her father in @entity7 and from her husband 's business interests in @entity47 the court also heard there was no medical or psychiatric evidence that she was a gambling addict			0
during her frequent trips to @entity5 , mrs @entity36 has been a regular in the capital ’s casinos , often spending outrageously			1
the judge said : ‘ she exhibited no signs of distress , irritation , anger or loss of control that evening			0
‘ it is striking that she and her family gambled away five million @entity116 dollars in @entity34 in june , some two to three months later			2
‘ the scale of her wealth ... is an inescapable feature of this case , as is the fact that , for those with the means to do so , it may be acceptable , or even enjoyable , to ride the roller coaster of losses			0
’ he rejected claims that mrs @entity36 had been given credit in breach of gaming rules			1
mrs @entity36 , who lives in @entity131 , @entity47 , was ordered to pay the £ 1million she owed , plus interest .			1

@entity134 , 50 , lost £ 2m using cheque - bought chips
refused to pay half the sum , claimed credit was ' *unlawfully* given to her '

but @entity19 rejected claim that staff had a ' duty of care ' for mrs @entity36
she spent *$* *5m* in @entity34 two months after the *incident* in april this year
judge @entity152 ruled she must pay back full £ 1m with interest
