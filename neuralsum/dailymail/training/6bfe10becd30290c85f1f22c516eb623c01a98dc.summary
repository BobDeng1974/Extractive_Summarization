professor @entity0 believes more parents will chose to start a family using @entity3 , even if they do not have fertility problems sex could soon exist purely for fun , as more women turn to @entity3 to have babies , the inventor of the contraceptive pill has claimed			1
professor @entity0 , 91 , believes the pill could become redundant as soon as 2050 , as more men and women choose to start a family through the ' insurance policy ' of @entity3 , even if they do not have fertility problems			1
it means would - be parents would freeze their eggs and sperms before being steralised , rendering the @entity11 pointless			2
the professor - who played a crucial role in developing the oral contraceptive in 1951 - says advances in fertility treatment will create a ' generation manana ' in which people know they can control the timing of parenthood , without any repercussions			2
but it also means sex will become a futile exercise for those wanting to reproduce - and will instead become purely recreational			0
speaking to the @entity36 , he said : ' the vast majority of women who will choose @entity3 in the future will be fertile women who have frozen their eggs and delayed pregnancy			2

and once that happens then @entity3 will start to become a normal non-coital method of having children			0
' he added : ' for them , the separation between sex and reproductions will be 100 per cent			1

at the moment , that figure is around five million			0

the professor , who has now retired from scientific work , has just penned his new autobiography , in retrospect : from the pill to the @entity77			0
the 91 - year - old predicts the pill could become redundant as soon as 2050 , as more people are steralised			1
