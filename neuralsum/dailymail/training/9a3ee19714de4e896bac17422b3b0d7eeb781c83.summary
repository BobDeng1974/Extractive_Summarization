the 30 - year - old insurance compliance analyst , from @entity12 , @entity13 , said today that he plans to spend the money wisely on a vacation for his wife @entity16 and invest in property			1
mr @entity3 finished third on wednesday 's edition of @entity19 ! - and overall took home close to $ 300,000 after controversial tactics which polarized viewers			1
@entity3 's @entity19 strategy involved ditching the time - honored practice of polishing off each category 's questions one by one			1
instead , he took a hopscotch approach to his category choices , which tended to keep his opponents off - kilter			0
he also concluded that the bottom rows of the game board are most likely to contain the hidden @entity41 and he played accordingly			0
@entity3 's strategy fueled indignation from @entity19 ! traditionalists , who contended that such an aggressive style was somehow unsportsmanlike and exhibited a lack of respect for the game			1
mr @entity3 told @entity26 on thursday : ' i spent a lot of time preparing			1
there 's a huge online community talking about this stuff , discussing the games			0
if you immerse yourself in the culture , you can find out about this stuff			0
' he said that his wife was really happy with his huge win along with his mom who watched @entity3 from the studio audience			2
jeopardy ! champ @entity3 plans to take his wife @entity65 on a vacation to @entity67 when asked how he would spend his prize money of $ 297,200 , he said : ' i do n't want to do anything crazy or stupid			1
' he plans to take his wife to @entity67 on vacation because she has never been and he wants to visit relatives he has n't seen in a long time			1
mr @entity3 also said he planned to buy a house in the future			1
mr @entity3 was unseated by @entity75 of @entity76 , @entity77 , who led for the day with $ 15,700			1
the reigning champ had struggled for much of the show when , in @entity19 , he risked , and lost , his entire day 's bankroll - $ 6,400 - on the question : ' he was the last male monarch who had not previously been @entity83			1
' only @entity75 had the correct response : @entity85			0
the 30 - year - old @entity3 described himself on @entity86 as ' mad genius , comedian , actor and freelance voiceover artist '			1
he applied a ' mad genius ' approach to @entity19 ! brinkmanship			2
@entity3 ' rejected the unwritten rule that the guy or gal with the most facts wins , ' said on the @entity99 host @entity100 on an episode of the public radio show last month , ' and replaced it with the appalling idea that you can outwit your opponent with the wily application of game theory '			2
it was a style much different from that of legendary know - it - all @entity112 , who a decade ago set a @entity19 ! record with 74 consecutive victories while winning $ 2.5 million			1
@entity3 , 30 , pictured with @entity19 ! host @entity115 , won a whopping $ 297,000 using game theory @entity3 , an insurance compliance analyst , who does freelance voiceovers , spent a month studying the quiz where people guess the questions to answers that pop up on the screen			1
when he first appeared on the show earlier this year , he baffled opponents by picking squares at random and betting strange amounts on his answers , rather than moving down the board in a straight line			2
@entity3 calls the strategy , which aims to disarm his opponents , @entity135 , after successful 1980s player @entity135 who also ' bounced ' around the board			2
his controversial strategy helped him win 12 times in a row			0
the strategy sparked outrage across social media , as viewers accused mr @entity3 of ' unsportsmanship '			1
but mr @entity3 dismissed the furor , telling @entity145 : ' like any game , strategy plays a big role			1
' he added : ' i ca n't change your impression of me but , again , we 're playing for money			0
between $ 10,000 and getting haters on @entity86 , $ 10,000 is more important to me			0
' ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! @entity155 : @entity3 's game - play tactics appear to delight and frustrate viewers in equal measure the so - called ' evil genius ' , as dubbed by angry @entity86 users , has also received support from the show 's host @entity164 , who said @entity3 ' seems to get ' the concept of winning			1
in the game , three contestants stand behind lecterns with a buzzer , a screen and a light pen			0
they are presented with answers to questions on a range of topics - history , science , arts , popular culture , literature , and languages - and must guess what was asked to reach them			0
each category has five clues , ranked in order of difficulty			0
for every correct answer , the player wins the value of the square - the easiest is $ 200 , the hardest is $ 1,000			2
there are also ' @entity41 ' , where a contestant can stake as much money as they want on a pot luck question in the hope of doubling it			2
@entity3 is quick and confident with his answers , darting from a $ 1,000 question to $ 200 for seemingly no reason			1
but he has received a mixed reception from viewers with some sites such as @entity204 are calling him a ' hero ' , whilst others blogs like @entity207 describe him as a ' mad genius '			0
before appearing on the show , @entity3 claims he studied the mechanics of the gameshow that has been running for 30 years			2
' i decided pretty early on , you know , i 'm not going to be able to learn all the things i do n't know in terms of actual knowledge , ' he says			0
' you only get a month between when they call you and when you have to go out for the show			0
so i said , ' what 's the strategy that 'll serve me best on the show ? ' it seems that people do n't actually think about the strategy of the game itself as much as they do about the knowledge			0
' ' i quickly found stories about former champions like @entity229 and @entity230 and @entity135 who 've bucked the tradition of starting at the top of each category and slowly going down and achieved great success in the game			0
' ' there 's no logical reason to do that -- if you are able to take your opponents by surprise and keep them guessing and on their toes about what the next clue is going to be , you gain a major advantage over them			0
one of the few parts of the game you actually have any control over is your power to select the next question after answering a question correctly , ' he told @entity252			0
@entity3 has been tweeting his performance each night on his @entity86 account @ arthur_effect and through @entity256 .			2
