he joins the likes of @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 in the @entity36 capital			0
@entity66 admitted that @entity4 was the toughest : ' it is the most difficult group in my opinion and i think that 's the same for most people , ' he said			0
' but we are champions of @entity36 and we are ready to compete with everybody			2
' @entity13 meanwhile have won the @entity78 title two years running and also won the @entity80 last season			0

' you 'd expect them to go through , probably as top of the group , ' he said			0
' @entity22 is a difficult game			0
it 's a great stadium there but it 's a lot of travelling and you do n't want to be doing too much of that and @entity20 is a classic game			1
' they were undefeated last year , they have their own ground now , which is very compact			0
' that will be a very difficult game but @entity15 have a fantastic squad now			1
' return : @entity130 ( left ) will be back in @entity174 with @entity20 when they take on @entity176 ' @entity15 finally , @entity24 will once again be considered to have been handed a straightforward draw but sir @entity179 's men failed to qualify from a similarly ' easy ' group last season			1
