today programme presenter @entity3 , 51 , said the change would boost the @entity10 's international reputation and help forge a ' mega-city ' stretching from @entity12 to @entity13			1

' go back to @entity18 ' : said it was a ' serious problem ' that parts of @entity6 such as @entity7 , home to the @entity5 's @entity17 @entity16 since 2011 , refused to simply be called ' @entity6 ' but @entity2 have reacted to his comments with disdain , with @entity7 's mayor calling the presenter ' london - centric ' and another local suggesting that he ' go back to @entity18 '			1
@entity3 made his proposal in an interview with the @entity27 ahead of the broadcast of the second episode of his @entity31 programme @entity33 , which looks @entity18 's dominance among @entity16 cities			1
' @entity37 s a serious problem for @entity6 that other people refuse to be called @entity6			2
itâ € ™ s doing it no favours			2
it [ @entity7 ] should be called @entity6 , ' he said			2
he pointed out that the two cities , despite their difference in names , share the 0161 telephone area code , the @entity50 post code , and the same inter-city rail connections			0
the move would help both cities to boost their ' international image ' and help them to compete with @entity57 cities like @entity58 , @entity59 , and @entity60 , @entity61 , he said			1
the @entity5 's @entity17 complex : @entity3 pointed out that @entity7 and @entity6 , despite their difference in names , share the same 0161 telephone area code , @entity50 post code , and inter-city rail connections but @entity68 , the mayor of @entity7 , dismissed the suggestion			1
' people clearly wonâ € ™ t know about @entity7 if we remove all mention of it from the map , ' he said			0
' this view is typical of a @entity18 - centric view of the world			0
fortunately the @entity16 isles is more diverse than @entity18 and a handful of big cities			0
our strength in the north lies is our diversity , not in all being the same			0
' @entity7 resident @entity83 echoed her mayor 's sentiment			2
' @entity7 is @entity7 , ' she told the @entity86			0
' we were here before @entity6 and we are proud of where we come from			0
' if [ @entity88 ] does n't like it , let him go back to @entity18			0

today man said change would boost the @entity10 's international *profile*
it would forge a ' mega-city ' stretching from @entity12 to @entity13 , he added
but locals are disdainful of the suggestion , calling it ' @entity102 '
