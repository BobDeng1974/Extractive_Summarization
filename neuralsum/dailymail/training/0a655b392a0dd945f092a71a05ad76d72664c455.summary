by @entity0 published : 07:20 est , 11 september 2012 updated : 08:11 est , 11 september 2012 @entity2 colors and famous stars helped @entity4 make his name in the art world but a new exhibition at @entity9 ’s @entity8 shows how the artist had a more nuanced impact over the past half century			1
the exhibit , titled regarding @entity4 : sixty artists , @entity13 , opens next week and intersperses @entity4 ’s work with pieces by other artists like @entity17 and @entity18 who counted the blond pop artist as a key influencer of their style			1
celebrities like @entity24 , first lady @entity25 and @entity26 are all highlighted in the show - titled regarding @entity4 - alongside the everyday objects that he helped turn into pop art. the man behind the myth : @entity4 's work is being exhibited at @entity33 starting next week given @entity4 ’s interest in the mass consumerism that was overtook @entity38 society in the late 1960s and 1970s , it comes as no surprise that his iconic picture of an oversized can of @entity43 ’s @entity42 is granted the same reverence as the @entity46 stars that @entity4 immortalized in bright hues			1
@entity4 ’s interest in fame and celebrity as well as media culture in general prompted him to re-examine mundane , everyday objects and approach them on an artistic scale similar to that of the @entity46 stars and political figures that were generally accepted as worthy of great art. objects of @entity4 's affection : the artist paid a great deal of attention to all aspects of popular culture , whether it was everyday items like @entity67 ( left ) or screen sirens like @entity24 ( right ) fittingly , his most famous statue is that of a @entity67 pad , showing that because @entity4 took his eccentric touch to the commonplace object , he was able to elevate it to a higher creative point than would have been expected in years prior			1
‘ he pained ( objects ) in a very hard - edged , straight forward way that also made people uncomfortable and confused because there seemed to be nothing expressive about his painting except for his choice of subject matter , ’ curator @entity75 says in the gallery ’s audio tour			2
modern interpretations : @entity18 ( left ) and @entity87 ( right ) feature in the exhibition as they are among the contemporary artists to take a lead from @entity4 's ideas beauty in the mundane : the work of contemporary artists like @entity17 are also highlighted in the exhibit as it examines how @entity4 influenced artists who came after him in keeping with the practice of highlighting the beauty in the mundane , the piece of @entity102 artist @entity17 ’s work that showcased in the exhibit is a reconstructed medicine cabinet that was once displayed in @entity107 , the popular @entity109 restaurant of which he was a co-owner before it closed in 2005			1
big anniversary : the exhibit is timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of this @entity114 soup painting @entity115 , @entity18 , and @entity116 are some of the other living artists whose work is portrayed alongside the work of @entity4 , who died in 1987			1
rather than the living and the dead , the starkest contrast in the exhibit is that between the everyday items that @entity4 raised up to a higher level of value with his work - for instance his revisited version of a foot treatment for calluses - with the portraits he made of the world ’s biggest stars			2
his oft - copied portraits of @entity25 , @entity24 and chairman @entity133 are instant attractions for even the most superficial of art aficionados			0
portraits of @entity137 , @entity138 , and @entity26 completed on lighter backgrounds with silver and grey paints are less glaring than the bright pinks and blues used in the bolder portraits , but they still provide a great homage to the stars of the silver screen			0
he was always chasing after this kind of person , ’ mr @entity75 said			0
as he elevated the @entity67 pad and the 19 - cent can of @entity114 , @entity4 was able to elevate a whole new class of celebrities through his art by allowing them to buy into the idea that if they had their portrait done by @entity4 , they would solidify their own fleeting fame			0
‘ the ‘ @entity166 ’ type people were coming to @entity4 starting in the 70s which of course was a way for them to join the likes of @entity24 , ’ mr @entity75 explained			0
the clearest example comes from @entity4 ’s painting entitled @entity169 , a portrait of insurance executive @entity171 who was one of the earliest commissioned sittings that @entity4 completed			0
famous faces : while much of the exhibit looks at his work regarding everyday objects , his famous portraits of former first lady @entity25 are also included given that he was the one to predict that ‘ in the future , everyone will be world - famous for 15 minutes ’ , it comes as no surprise that @entity4 had a hand in creating lasting legacies for those who would have otherwise been forgotten			2
for a man obsessed with the famous and the act of becoming it , the celebration of @entity4 ’s art on the 50th anniversary of his 32 @entity190 painting shows that his name and work has clearly extended past his 15 minutes and shows no signs of stopping .			0
