by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter a bigger earthquake along the lesser - known fault that gave @entity6 a moderate shake could do more damage to the region than the long - dreaded ' @entity10 ' from the more famous @entity11 , experts warn			2
the @entity12 thrust fault , which brought friday night 's magnitude - 5.1 quake centered in @entity16 and well over 100 aftershocks by sunday , stretches from northern @entity18 under downtown @entity19 into @entity20 -- a heavily populated swath of the @entity19 area			1
a magnitude - 7.5 earthquake along that fault could prove more catastrophic than one along the @entity11 , which runs along the outskirts of metropolitan @entity6 , seismologists said			1
such a quake along the @entity12 fault could kill 3,000 to 18,000 people and cause up to $ 250 billion in damage , according to estimates from the @entity33			1
in contrast , a larger magnitude 8 quake along the @entity11 would cause an estimated 1,800 deaths			2
the destruction wrought by a magnitude - 7.5 earthquake along the @entity12 thrust fault could be far worse than the damage from friday 's quake , seen here , meaning up to 18,000 deaths and possibly $ 250 billion in damage the shaking from a 7.5 quake in the center of urban @entity19 could be so intense it would lift heavy objects in the air , like the 1989 @entity53 in @entity54 , where the shaking was so bad ' we found an upside - down grand piano , ' @entity33 seismologist @entity47 told the @entity58			1
that would ' hit all of downtown , ' @entity59 said			0
' and everywhere from @entity16 to @entity20			2
' part of the problem with the potential damage is that the fault runs near so many vulnerable older buildings , many made of concrete , in downtown @entity19 and @entity20			1
' in terms of location , it could n't be much worse , ' said @entity72 , a professor at @entity74 's department of @entity76 sciences , told @entity77 in 2003 while working on a study of faults			0
' @entity80 is sitting on top of this thing			0
' the @entity12 fault is horizontal and stretches through downtown @entity19 and @entity20 -- meaning a wide area could be affected by a magnitude - 7.5 quake			1
here , construction workers wait for a new section of pipe to be cut after friday 's magnitude - 5.1 quake part of the potential problem is that the fault would hit many older concrete buildings , and damage could cost up to $ 250 billion dollars			1
construction workers are seen here lowering pipe after friday 's quake and because the fault , discovered in 1999 , is horizontal , heavy reverberations are likely to be felt over a wide area , roughly 25 by 15 miles			2
scientists believe a major quake happens along the fault roughly every 2,500 years -- but do n't know when the last one was , the @entity58 reports			1
in 1987 , the fault caused the @entity106 earthquake			0
still considered moderate at magnitude 5.9 , that quake killed eight people and did more than $ 350 million in damage			2
about 150 aftershocks , including one of magnitude - 4.1 , were felt since friday night 's quake , which forced several dozen people in the @entity18 city of @entity118 out of their homes after firefighters discovered foundation problems that made the buildings unsafe to enter , authorities said			1
fire crews red - tagged 20 apartment units after finding a major foundation crack , but residents have since been allowed to return			2
structural woes , including broken chimneys and leaning , were uncovered in half a dozen single - family houses , which were also deemed unsafe to occupy until building inspectors clear the structures			0
about two dozen residents remained displaced , down from more than 80 after the initial quake			0
another 14 residential structures around the city suffered lesser damage , including collapsed fireplaces			0
a water - main break flooded several floors of @entity141 , and the shaking knocked down computers and ceiling tiles , @entity138 said			0
it was not immediately clear if @entity141 would reopen monday			0
an email to the mayor was not immediately returned			0
a @entity149 worker and a geologist look at a rock wall where a rockslide closed a @entity6 road on saturday march 29			0
a potential magnitude - 7.5 quake from the @entity12 thrust could be so intense it would lift heavy objects in the air			1

magnitude - 7.5 quake on @entity12 thrust fault could kill between 3,000 and 18,000 people
quake could cost up to $ 250 billion in damage
fault runs near many older buildings made of concrete in downtown @entity19 and @entity20
because fault is horizontal , intense shaking could occur over 25 by 15 mile area
scientists say major quake occurs along fault every 2,500 years -- but do n't know when last one was
