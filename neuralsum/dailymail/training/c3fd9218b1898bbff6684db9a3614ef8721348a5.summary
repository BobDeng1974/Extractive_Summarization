by @entity0 published : 18:27 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 03:01 est , 30 may 2013 reform : justice secretary @entity2 has decided criminals who are jailed for less than 12 months will be prevented from leaving @entity4 all prisoners are to be banned from travelling abroad for up to 12 months after being released			1
justice secretary @entity2 has decided that , for the first time , the 50,000 criminals a year who are jailed for less than 12 months will be prevented from leaving @entity4 if released on licence or under a ‘ supervision period ’			1
mr @entity2 said some of those released would also be prevented from moving around the country and would need permission from probation officers to spend a night away from their ‘ approved ’ residence			1
he believes that criminals released after short sentences should not be able to enjoy foreign holidays and should focus instead on finding a job in their local community			1
‘ we want to help offenders help themselves			0
' if they are to finally step out from the gloomy shadows of criminality , they need to be given every chance , ’ said mr @entity2			0
‘ sometimes that will mean taking a firm position and restricting someone ’s movements			0
but it is for the purpose of giving them a better chance in life and helping them become law - abiding members of their community			0
’ under current rules , anyone given more than a year in jail is banned from travelling abroad for 12 months and are returned to prison if they break the terms of their licence			1
mr @entity2 wants to apply this to those released after short sentences , such as disgraced former cabinet minister @entity52 , who served two months behind bars			1
passports will not be confiscated but prisoners on licence are expected to report regularly to their probation officers			2
former inmates will only be allowed to travel abroad in ‘ exceptional ’ circumstances , such as attending a close relative ’s funeral			2
under current rules , anyone given more than a year in jail is banned from travelling abroad for 12 months foreign travel prohibition for prisoners released after short sentences is being introduced in the @entity66 , and can now be imposed as part of a community order or suspended sentence order			1
mr @entity2 has also ordered a review of the sentencing regime , introduced by @entity72 a decade ago , which allows all but the worst offenders to be released halfway into their sentences			2
instead of being freed automatically , the most serious violent and sexual offenders will have to earn the right to be released by taking classes or working while behind bars			2
private firms and charities are also to be paid to provide mentors , including reformed prisoners , to meet every offender at the prison gate and help turn them away from a life of crime			0
in the biggest shake - up of prisoner rehabilitation for more than a century , mr @entity2 is to pay organisations if they prevent inmates reoffending after release			0
the move has infuriated probation officers , who say 70 per cent of their work will be put out to tender and they claim that it would put public safety at risk			0
mr @entity2 will insist that radical steps are needed to address high reoffending rates which mean almost half of all prison - leavers are reconvicted within 12 months			1
for those serving less than a year that figure is almost 58 per cent .			0

criminals jailed for less than 12 months will not be able to leave @entity4 if released on licence
some would also be prevented from moving around the country
under current rules , anyone jailed for more than a year is banned from travelling abroad for 12 months
