taken down : library whispers , a social networking website for @entity2 students , has been shut due to ' bullying and abusive messages ' from a ' large number of individuals ' forced to go offline : site creator @entity25 in @entity2 today comments included sexist and offensive remarks such as ' just spat on a working - class person '			1
one of its creators , @entity25 , said the website had turned into a ' forum of hate ' and that they had to close it before something ' really bad happened '			2
he wrote on the @entity6 homepage : ' first , apologies to those who used @entity6 to share innocent and interesting whispers on this site			1
' because of an unfortunately large number of individuals who abused @entity6 and who posted the worst sort of bullying and abusive messages on the site , @entity6 2012 has had to close			1
' the site was started to give people the opportunity to break the boring revision period with a bit of interest , but it has turned into a forum of hate and revealed that , sadly , there are a lot of angry people in @entity2			2
' the decision to close the site was taken before anything really bad happened on @entity6 , and to prevent individuals from showing themselves to be complete idiots without a thought for the feelings of other people ' obscene : some of the offensive comments left on the website and which caused it to be shut down the website was set up last year by a group of students to communicate in university libraries			1
each library could be ' whispered ' from but there was no other information to identify the poster the site took off almost immediately and saw over 1,000 posts within five days			0
the founders said at the time : ' we ’ve had people arranging midnight liaisons , secret updates about librarians , indecent propositions and @entity88 leaks			0
' but this term they said the number of offensive comments posted on the website had escalated			2
comments included one from a student at @entity96 which said : ' do n’t worry she was a female arts student			0
female x arts = second order , so can be ignored			0
' prestigious : but @entity2 students made sexist and offensive remarks such as ' just spat on a working - class person ' privileged : last week , students shocked locals by stripping off , vomiting and urinating in flower beds after drinking themselves into oblivion in a public park another student from @entity111 posted : ' i hate this f * * * * * * library and every single person inside it			2
i hope you all fail your exams			0
' others said : ' i can hear you clicking at your f * * * * * * card game through my headphones you inconsiderate d * * * ' and ' crazy laughing b * * * * in the corner please desist '			0
