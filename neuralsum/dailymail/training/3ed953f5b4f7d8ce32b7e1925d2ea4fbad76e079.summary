a patent reveal @entity2 's proposal for a wearable sensor that detects physical movements and automatically emits pleasant - smelling odours			1
the built - in spray dispenser - described in the files as a ‘ fragrance emission device ’ - would be activated and a fan would ‘ waft ’ the smell out of the wearable ’s casing ( illustrated ) the built - in spray dispenser – described in the files as a ‘ fragrance emission device ’ – would be activated and a fan would ‘ waft ’ the smell out of the wearable ’s casing			1
a warning would also be sent to the user before the smell is emitted , giving them the chance to disable the feature if they do n’t want to release the odour - for example , in a busy gym or confined space			1
‘ the user may confirm the fragrance emission as planned , or may override the planned emission , ’ explained the patent			1
as with all patents , the latest filing does n't mean @entity2 is planning to release the product any time soon , or at all			2
an alternative device , however , is currently raising money on @entity54			0
the @entity56 accessory is a smartphone case fitted with a small vial designed to hold any liquid of the owner 's choice			0
this could include perfume , suntan lotion , insect repellent , fresh breath spray or more			2
the nozzle protrudes from the rear of the case and can be tucked away when not in use			0
‘ in one instance , the user may be planning on taking the rest of the day off after the walk , after which the user will go home and shower			0
’ @entity2 also described the sensor as having ‘ a communication and route suggesting portion			1
’ the device would be web - enabled to connect to social networks and determine the proximity of friends , for example			1
the ‘ route ’ portion would then ‘ provide an alternate route to travel such that the predicted odour may not offend others that are socially connected to the user and that travel the same routes as the user			1

the patent was filed by @entity2 in *august* 2012 and *awarded* this week
it *details* a sensor that detects physical activity and emits odours
a built - in spray would activate and a fan would direct the fragrance
this could be used to *counteract* the smell of sweat , for example
wearable sensor can also provide directions to avoid friends that could be ‘ offended ’ by any odour emitted
and users would be able to change the fragrance , or stop it being released
