by @entity0 published : 08:09 est , 8 february 2013 updated : 09:18 est , 8 february 2013 had @entity4 not suffered a stroke , the two - inch tumour in her brain would have remained undetected and could have killed her a schoolgirl 's life was saved when she suffered a stroke - because doctors discovered she had a deadly brain tumour			1
@entity4 , 15 , had been in constant pain for two years and endured crippling headaches and completely lost her appetite			1
playground bullies teased her about her shrinking size and a dietitian said she was suffering from an eating disorder			1
but despite repeated visits to her doctor and specialists , @entity4 's tumour was only detected after she suffered a stroke and collapsed at home			1
doctors told her parents @entity26 and @entity27 , 43 , that if she had n't suffered the attack , the two - inch tumour would have remained undetected and could have killed her			1
@entity4 had an eight - and - a - half hour emergency operation to remove the growth - with no guarantee of survival - but is now on the road to recovery			1
@entity4 's health problems started in october 2010 when she was just 13			1
she was taken to the family doctor near her home in @entity39 , @entity40 , complaining of a loss of appetite and a lack of energy and was diagnosed with glandular fever			1
but her condition deteriorated and her weight dropped dramatically			2
she was so tired that she was forced to give up playing football as training sessions became too much			0
before being diagnosed , @entity4 ( with mother @entity26 ) had been in constant pain for two years and endured crippling headaches and completely lost her appetite it was only after a massive stroke that doctors found a rare brain tumour that had been growing for two years @entity4 said : ' it was gradual			1
it started off with me not wanting to eat breakfast , then i would n't want to eat lunch and then i would n't want to eat anything on a daily basis			0
' i did n't want to do anything , i did n't want to go anywhere and i did n't want to see anyone			0
i did n't feel well enough to go out			0
' i just got thinner and thinner			0
i used to get teased every day and i did n't want to get changed for @entity67 because people looked at me funny			0
' i was sick of people telling me that i had an eating disorder and that i had an issue with food			1
' an mri scan revealed a benign tumour two - inches wide growing upwards towards her skull			2
@entity4 had to undergo a gruelling eight - hour emergency operation to remove the tumour the type of tumour @entity4 had - haemangioblastoma - usually forms on the kidneys or the liver , so doctors were baffled to find it on the brain the real cause of @entity4 's condition only emerged after her stroke last september when an mri scan revealed a benign two - inch tumour growing upwards towards her skull			1
she said : ' at the time , i just thought " 15 - year - olds do n't have strokes "			2
it was horrible , but it 's the best thing that has ever happened to me			0
' i ca n't really remember the stroke , but i remember being scared and shouting			2
i had pins and needles in my arm , then it spread to my leg , then my face , then i could n't feel my tongue			0
' when the doctor told me the worst possible scenario would be a brain tumour , i did n't take it in			1
i did n't think it was a possibility			0
' it 's thought that @entity4 's stroke was triggered by pressure from the tumour building up in her brain			1
around 4,300 benign tumours of the central nervous system are diagnosed each year in the @entity115 but of these only two in 100 are haemangioblastomas			0
her mother @entity26 , 47 , said : ' the type of tumour that @entity4 had - haemangioblastoma - was uncommon and usually forms on the kidneys or the liver , so doctors were baffled to find it on the brain			1
they 'd never seen it there before			0
@entity4 on the day of the brain tumour surgery ( left ) ; she is now on the road to recovery and said : ' having a stroke was horrible , but it 's the best thing that has ever happened to me ' ' they told us that if it was n't for the stroke then it would n't have been detected			1
' it was a nightmare			0
you think that these things happen to somebody else , you never think that it could happen to you			0
' she has since gained over two stone in weight , rediscovered her appetite and is attending school a few days per week			2
mrs @entity4 , a a security officer at @entity150 , said : ' people need to be aware that just because kids are young does n't mean that they want to look like size - zero models			1
' the stigma of kids not eating because they want to be thin and like models is not always the case			2
' looking back i feel relieved			0
as a mother i 'm delighted that she is back with all her friends and doing what she has wanted to do for the past two years			2
' our life has changed as a family and we take every day as it comes			0
i know it can only get better now			0
' @entity166 , head information nurse at @entity167 , said : ' it 's important that any symptoms in children are taken seriously and any unexplained symptoms should be investigated if they persist			0
' but the signs of brain tumours can be quite vague and hard to identify and most gps and @entity176 departments will hardly ever see a case			2
