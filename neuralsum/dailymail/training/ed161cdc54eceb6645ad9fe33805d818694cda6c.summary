by @entity0 published : 23:51 est , 22 september 2013 updated : 01:14 est , 23 september 2013 defense lawyers for three former @entity3 football players accused of raping their female classmate spent an estimate of 30 hours over the course of a few days asking the victim inappropriate questions about her sex life			1
in addition to asking the victim whether or not she apologized to one of her classmates for being a ' ho , ' they asked her if she was wearing a bra and underwear at the party and asked her how she opened her mouth to perform oral sex			1
the defense tried to argue that the victim 's opening her mouth counted as ' active participation ' and therefore qualified as sexual consent			1
the alleged assault took place in april 2012 at an off - campus house in @entity28 referred to as ' the football house			0
' the then 20 - year - old @entity30 woke up with bruises after a night of heavy drinking and later learned from friends and social media that three football players claimed to have had sex with her while she was intoxicated @entity39 , @entity3 football player and accused rapist who allegedly participated in gang rape at the @entity28 ' football house ' @entity43 , @entity3 football player and accused rapist who allegedly participated in gang rape at the @entity28 ' football house ' @entity46 , @entity3 football player and accused rapist who allegedly participated in gang rape at the @entity28 ' football house ' one of the accused attackers tweeted , ' the train tickets were on the low , ' indicating it was easy to engage with the victim sexually			2
the victim was at first hesitant to press charges against classmates @entity55 , @entity46 , and @entity43			0
the girl 's attorney @entity56 said that when the girl first reported allegations to @entity60 she was disciplined for drinking and the boys were allowed to continue playing			0
in early 2013 , the female student decided to seek legal help and the @entity60 re-opened the investigation , @entity63 said			0
now the girl 's rape trial is an @entity70 proceeding , a military hearing meant to determine whether or not a case is trial material			1
according to the @entity76 , @entity77 32 proceedings , ' permit questions not allowed in civilian courts and can include cross-examinations of witnesses so intense that legal experts say they frighten many victims from coming forward			0
' the ' football ' house in @entity28 where the victim was allegedly raped by her classmates many military legal experts want to get rid of @entity70 proceedings			2
@entity89 , a professor at the @entity90 said , ' what this case shows is that we think the military justice system can somehow solve the sexual assault problem , but it ca nâ€™t			2
' explicitly sexual questions like the one 's asked by the defense in this trial would not be asked in a civilian case			1
even though people like @entity89 are against the proceedings , @entity102 officials say the proceedings are meant to protect innocent victims and ensure that there is sufficient enough evidence to go to trial			0
senator @entity110 is currently working on a bill that would remove military assault cases from the chain of command			0
@entity56 , the victim 's lawyer filed a federal lawsuit to strip the @entity3 's superintendent of authority over the case .			1

defense attorneys tried to prove that the victim 's opening her mouth counted as ' active participation '
the defense asked her if she was wearing a bra and underwear at the party
her case is an @entity70 military proceeding which allows for *personal* questions to determine whether a case is fit for trial
