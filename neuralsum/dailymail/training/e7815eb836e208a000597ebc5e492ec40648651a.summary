claims : dr @entity1 leads the @entity2 only one in six people in @entity4 think they live as part of a traditional family , according to claims by a new think - tank yesterday			1
apparently , only a small minority come from ‘ traditional nuclear families ’ with married parents and two or more children , the @entity9 for the @entity10 said			1
its report said the traditional family is out of date and that the government should consider ways to support alternative family forms that are adopted by the majority			1
but the group ’s research and findings were criticised by analysts who said that according to official statistics , six out of ten of all families with children are led by two married parents			2
family researcher and author @entity31 said : ‘ a large majority of couples are still married			1
‘ by painting the traditional family as a tiny minority this report is giving a false picture of life in @entity4			1
it makes one wonder what their agenda is			0
‘ their data is absurdly fixed			0
it is at odds with the official data on the family			2
’ and one of the panel of experts that drew up the report , financed by the @entity53 insurance group , acknowledged that the low figure thrown up by its research was connected to the way the questions were framed			2
the report comes at a key moment for @entity18 policy on the family , with a gap appearing to widen between supporters of ministers such as @entity65 who would like to see the tax and benefit system changed to support married couples , and those who believe state support for marriage should take a low priority			1
traditional family ? apparently only a small minority come from ' traditional nuclear families ' with married parents and two or more children ( posed by models ) @entity78 ’s latest pledge is to extend the full title of marriage to same - sex couples who , at present , can become civil partners but do not have the right to call themselves married			1
the @entity9 for the @entity10 produced its findings from research that involved ‘ in - depth interviews ’ with an unspecified group of people and a phone survey of 3,000 people carried out by the @entity91			2
the research was then examined by a panel that included @entity53 chairman @entity94 , a @entity96 donor who advised @entity97 and retained close links with @entity100 ’s administration , and dr @entity1 , who leads the @entity2 , a state - funded quango			2
the report said that ‘ just 16 per cent of people define themselves as part of a ' traditional ' family of two married parents living together with two or more children ’			1
lord @entity94 said : ‘ what is striking about our new research is how quickly new family structures and our attitudes towards them have changed in the past few decades			0
@entity78 's latest pledge is to extend the full title of marriage to same - sex couples ‘ so quickly , in fact , we suspect society has failed to keep up with the dramatic changes we are seeing in family life across the @entity4			1
‘ by society , i mean @entity18 and public policy			0
but i also mean companies , charities and our public services			0
’ the report said : ‘ the majority of people feel their family is unrepresented by politicians , the media and advertising , with 52 per cent claiming the government does not take their family set - up into account			1
‘ the findings indicate family structures are becoming increasingly diverse			1
a quarter of all couples are childless , and one in five lives alone			0
as a result of this , half of the population believe society is out of date in its view of the family			0
‘ in addition to married mums and dads with two or more children , @entity4 are increasingly likely to describe single - parent , same - sex , or unmarried couples as “ proper ” families			1
’ but professor @entity155 of @entity156 , one of the centre ’s panel , acknowledged that the findings on numbers of traditional families have been influenced by the research methods used			2
‘ the 16 per cent is connected to the way they phrased it , ’ he said			0
‘ we did not assume that 16 per cent of people were married with kids			0
i would be stunned if that were the case			0
they are doing it on the basis of 2.4 kids			0
’ the latest official figures on family structure were published by the @entity176 in april			0
they show that 60 per cent of families living with children aged 16 and under , or under 18 if still at school , are headed by married parents			0
if all families – defined as all couples , including same - sex couples and couples who are childless or whose children have grown up , together with single parent families – are counted , married families make up 68 per cent of the total			1
the figures apply to 2010 and were gathered from the @entity191 , which covers 60,000 homes .			0

only one in six @entity4 think they live in a ' traditional family ' , according to report
@entity4 are increasingly likely to describe single - parent , same - sex , or unmarried couples as ' proper ' families
