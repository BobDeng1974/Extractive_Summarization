by @entity0 published : 06:08 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 08:15 est , 10 july 2013 an @entity2 advert showing a curvaceous mother discussing her cleavage with her horrified teenage son has been deemed acceptable by the advertising watchdog despite 176 complaints			1
the television ad features buxom actress @entity9 , 43 , in a tightly - fitting pink cardigan telling her son : ' new push - up bra			1
amazing eh ? ' as his friends ogle her breasts			2
but the son 's shock and embarrassment faded as he sipped @entity2 and he responds : ' looking good mum			0
' his mother then gives him a big cuddle before suggesting a ' group hug ' to which his friends agree enthusiastically			0
see the advert below fury : the @entity2 advert starring @entity9 , 43 , as a buxom mother has prompted more than 170 complaints from viewers cheeky : the advert shows a mother in a tight - fitting pink cardigan who then tells her embarrassed son and his two delighted friends : ' new push - up bra			1
amazing eh ? ' viewers complained the relationship between the mother and her teenage son 's friends is inappropriate the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) said many of the complaints believed the ad was offensive and irresponsible because they the scenario between the mother and the young men was ' sexual and inappropriate '			1
but it has ruled that the advert was not irresponsible , sexist or demeaning and focused on the son 's embarrassment rather than the mother trying to seduce her son 's friends			1
the @entity42 said : ' although we noted that some complainants had interpreted the action in the ads as portraying an inappropriate relationship between the mum and the son 's friends , we did not consider that their interaction was a portrayal of irresponsible behaviour			2
' we considered that the action relied on the mum being confident and attractive , but not consciously or overtly behaving in a sexualised or flirtatious way			0
eye - catching : the teenager 's friends can be seen ogling his mother 's breasts as she bends down to clean the table awkward : the teenager looks distinctively uncomfortable as his friends stare at his attractive mother but his embarrassment is eased when he takes a sip of @entity2 - then telling his mother : ' looking good , mum ' ' we also considered that the focus of the ads was the son 's embarrassment at the effect his mum 's appearance was having on his friends			2
' therefore , and particularly in the context of ads intended to portray a surreal and light - hearted comedic approach , we did not consider that the action or depiction of the female protagonist was sexist or demeaning and concluded that the ads were not in breach of the code			0
' the @entity42 ruled that no further action was necessary			2
others complained that the ad was sexist and demeaning to women , while some were concerned that it was inappropriately scheduled at a time when children could have been viewing			0
too close for comfort : but his relief is short - lived when his mother grabs him by the head for a tight cuddle ' group hug ' : and when his mother suggests a big group hug , the teenagers friends are more than happy to oblige cleared : the @entity42 found that the advert was not irresponsible as it concentrated on the embarrassment of the son @entity2 manufacturer @entity117 said it wanted the ad to ' stay true to the traditionally cheeky and irreverent sense of humour ' of previous campaigns but not to ' objectify women , carry any tone of a sexual nature or cause offence '			1
it said the focus of the ad was the son 's embarrassment and the comedic concept that @entity2 would help him deal with such an awkward situation			0
it added that the young men were not reacting in a way that portrayed sexuality or colluding in a salacious fashion , but were rather transfixed by the mother 's appearance .			0
