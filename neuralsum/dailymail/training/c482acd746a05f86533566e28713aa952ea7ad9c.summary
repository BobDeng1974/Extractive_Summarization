@entity0 is refusing to give up on a top - four place despite his @entity3 team crashing to a disappointing defeat against @entity5			1
an own goal from @entity12 in the first half , @entity7 ’s close - range strike and a goal scored by @entity10 ’s shoulder humiliated @entity3 and ended @entity5 ’s five - game losing streak			1
the loss left @entity3 10th in the table and 10 points behind @entity18 in fourth place , but @entity0 is adamant that they are very much in the race for a @entity22 place			1
@entity0 is insistent that @entity3 are still in contention to earn a @entity22 place @entity0 ( second left ) gives instructions to @entity26 ( second right ) in the 3 - 0 loss to @entity5 @entity28 ( left ) of @entity3 challenges @entity5 debutant @entity29 for possession ( right ) ‘ the league is more open than it was the last campaign , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ i must admit that at this stage you could feel the first three positions were taken but i do n’t think that is the case			0
‘ @entity5 and @entity18 have been the best teams for me this season when you look at how they have performed			1
that opens a real competitive edge in the top six			2
‘ @entity43 and @entity44 are there			0
i still think there are a lot of points to fight for			0
there are a lot of teams who are going to get a lot of points from each other			0
‘ from our point of view it is about getting a good run of results , making sure we reach a good level of performance and we try and get into the final third of the season with an opportunity to finish as high as we can			2
‘ the result against @entity5 is a real disappointment , do n’t get me wrong , but i think we need to see through what we can achieve after that disappointment			2
’ @entity3 have struggled for consistency this season			1
following their convincing win against @entity75 a week ago , after four games without a victory , a defeat so heavy to @entity5 in their dire form was unexpected			2
@entity0 is under no illusions that @entity77 and @entity78 are fighting it out for the title but he insists that a whole host of teams , including his own , are in contention for the other @entity22 places			1
@entity5 captain @entity85 ( left ) heads towards goal as @entity5 beat @entity3 3 - 0 @entity12 ( second left ) inadvertently directed the ball beyond @entity88 for @entity5 's opener @entity90 ( right ) of @entity3 challenges @entity5 and @entity91 striker @entity7 ( left ) for the ball ‘ i do think that @entity78 and @entity77 are a step ahead of everybody else , ’ he admitted			1
‘ after that i do think that any team can go into a very good run and finish the season strong			0
‘ the league is getting more competitive every time and everybody can take points off of anyone			0
i do think that @entity18 and @entity5 have had a really strong start that will mean a lot of teams will lose points against them			2
‘ i still think that @entity108 will have a revival and obviously teams like @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity111 that they are built to win things and to finish in the @entity22 that will open the league up if you can find a good run of results and form you can always sneak in			0
‘ that ’s what we are trying to do			0
win as many points as we can and we ’ll see where that can take us			0

@entity3 have endured a *stuttering* season and are **eleventh** in the league
a 3 - 0 loss at @entity5 has left them *languishing* in **eleventh**
but @entity0 insists @entity3 are in the running for the top four
