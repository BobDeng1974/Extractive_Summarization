manager @entity0 is convinced something is finally happening at @entity2 again - and everyone can ' smell ' it			1
the @entity6 romped to a 4 - 1 win over @entity8 at the @entity9 in saturday 's lunchtime kick - off , which was a seventh successive @entity11 victory and moved them up into second place			1
while @entity15 could reclaim second by beating @entity16 on monday and the title looks out of reach as @entity19 remain seven points ahead with a match in hand , there is no doubt when @entity0 has all of his squad available @entity2 are capable of giving anyone a run for their money			1
right back @entity29 gave @entity2 the lead with a superb left - foot curling into the corner to get things going at the @entity9 @entity29 broke the @entity9 deadlock for @entity2 , cutting in from his native right - hand side and curling a left - foot strike into the corner although there was disappointment at failure to progress in @entity45 following elimination by @entity47 , the prospect of an improved league finish and successful @entity41 defence remains very much on the agenda			1
@entity0 , who was often criticised over the direction of his team following almost a decade without a trophy , feels finally things are starting to come together			2
' we have a good mentality and good cohesion in the team , ' he said			0
' there is something happening , that shows you that they are ready to fight for each other			0
@entity62 is congratulated by his team - mates after his magnificent free - kick on the half hour mark put @entity2 fully in control of the game ' you can see that , you ca n't cheat on that , people smell that			1
' it of course is a good basis , and defensively we are getting better			0
' following a poor start to the campaign , @entity2 were expected to struggle to sustain a place in the top four			1
@entity0 , though , will not get complacent			1
' i am old enough to know that things are never as comfortable as they look , but what is true is that it 's in our hands			0
how well we deal with the situation now will be important , ' he said			0
@entity86 celebrates with @entity87 after his stunning strike from just outside the penalty area made it 3 - 0 to @entity2 in the first half @entity0 has his sights set on getting as close to @entity19 as possible , with the leaders set to come to the @entity9 on april 26			1
' i am a competitor and what that means is you have to go as high and as far as you can			0
when you go home if somebody was better than us , then ' well done ' , but we have to have given our best until the end and that is what i would like to do , ' he said			0
' let 's give everything to do it and see what happens			0
but @entity87 ended any hopes of a @entity8 comeback by smashing in a fantastic fourth for @entity2 in stoppage time ' we are in a good position , with four games at home and only three away			1
' we are on a good run , so i would say that it will be down to how we can maintain that focus and level of urgency between now and the end of the season			0
' after failing to make the most of their positive start on saturday , @entity2 had to soak up some pressure from @entity8 , with @entity126 failing to capitalise when put in on goal			1
a huge flag is waved as @entity129 and @entity87 are among the first team - mates to congratulate the unlikely opening goalscorer the @entity6 finally broke the deadlock through the unlikely source of full - back @entity29 , who slotted home a fine left - foot curling effort on 37 minutes			0
it proved the catalyst for an onslaught , with @entity62 's free - kick and a rocket by @entity86 on the stroke of half - time effectively ending the contest			2
after @entity2 's tempo dropped , @entity8 reduced the arrears with a penalty from @entity147 , but following the dismissal of @entity150 for a second yellow card , @entity87 cracked home a late fourth to cap a memorable afternoon 's work			1
@entity86 got in on the goalscoring act just before half - time , finding space outside the box to smash a drive over the head of keeper @entity159 @entity0 admits he has been impressed by the work - rate of both @entity29 and defensive midfielder @entity161 , who were each drafted into the first - team as cover for injury , but are now an integral part of the side			1
asked if either man was in his thoughts at the start of the season , @entity0 said : ' honestly , no. but my job is to remain open - minded and make decisions when you have to			2
' ( i picked @entity29 against @entity8 ) because of his pace			2
' i thought ( @entity178 ) @entity177 would play and then @entity126 would have gone on the flank			0
@entity161 challenges @entity177 during the @entity11 match at @entity9 ' because of his low centre of gravity , @entity126 changes direction very quickly and @entity29 is short as well			2
' @entity0 added : ' i think you also have to give credit to players who get less , such as @entity161			2
' in the first half he broke up many attacks in a convincing way			0
' but honestly i could n't say that in my head ( at the start of the season ) @entity161 was one of the first - choice players			0

@entity2 maintained they superb run of form by thumping @entity8
@entity0 's side moved into second place following the 4 - 1 victory
@entity0 believes everyone can ' smell ' what is happening at the @entity9
however , @entity206 manager is *refusing* to get complacent with their form
