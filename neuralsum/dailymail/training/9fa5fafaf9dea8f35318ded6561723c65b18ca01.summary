since turning 35 earlier this month , @entity0 winner @entity0 has decided to freeze her eggs			1
the tv star , who shot to fame after winning @entity5 's approval on the @entity7 reality show has made the tough decision after reaching her mid-thirties without finding @entity10			1
but the choice also centres around @entity0 's successful career in business , which she believes would face a setback if she took time out right now to have children			1
@entity17 winner made the decision because of career ambitions , but also because she wants to find the right life partner without the pressure from her biological clock she made the revelation after @entity25 and @entity26 's announcement this week that they would be providing financial support to female employees who wanted to freeze their eggs			1
@entity0 said : ' we live in this society now where it used to be that women stayed at home , the chap was the breadwinner , but times have now changed because we have a choice			1
' lots of women want to stay at home , but i ’m in a position now where i want to focus on my career			2
' i believe that i can achieve anything that i want in the workplace and the one thing that is restricting me is my biological clock ' it ’s a mixture of three things , i have an awful lot that i want to achieve in my career , i have n’t met the right guy yet that i want to settle down with and also i feel like i ’m just not ready			1
' and the career woman is quick to dismiss any speculation that women who feel like this are lacking in maternal instinct			2
@entity0 with @entity5 after winning @entity17 in 2006 she told this morning earlier today : ' i absolutely want to be a mum			1
' when i think my future , it absolutely involves family - family means the world to me , but i ’m just not ready to be a mum			2
' what i want is the choice			0
' now in her mid-thirties , @entity0 and her friends have reached a common age where conversation on nights out inevitably turns to one thing - motherhood			1
she said : ' i turned 35 a couple of days ago and the topic of who is going to have kids , when we ’re going to have kids - there are so many cocktails that ( my friends and i ) have drunk while discussing that topic			0
' you go round and round and it drives you mad			0
' i do n’t want that pressure in my life			0
i do n’t want to meet a guy in a bar and instead of getting to know him , be trying to find out whether he wants kids , when he ’d want them and his intentions for the future			0
' so @entity0 is hoping that by freezing her eggs , she will manage to both alleviate the time pressures on her body clock , but also achieve all of her career ambitions before she finally settles down to have a family			1
she said : ' i want to be a mum when i am still young enough to enjoy the kids , ideally for me it would be early forties			0
' as a woman it ’s really hard to decide when is the right time and who is the right person - freezing your eggs is almost an insurance policy			2
@entity0 appeared on this morning today to talk about her decision ' but hopefully life will move on and nature will take it ’s course and i ’ll meet someone who is awesome , settle down with them , have a family and probably not even use these eggs			1
' @entity0 believes that for these reasons , @entity26 and @entity25 are right to offer to cover the procedure costs of up to £ 12,600 when it comes to freezing eggs			1
she said : ' there are so many people saying that they just want to control you as an employee , that ’s ridiculous , this company asked what is important to their employees and this is what they came up with			0
' let ’s get all of this in balance , @entity26 do all of those other things like childcare already			0
' they provide adoption support , enhanced maternity leave , this is a package of benefits , it ’s not an isolated package on its own			0
' but obviously anything has side effects and the thing people need to do is do their research			0
' people need to truly understand what it means , how it will affect you and how your life can revolve around that as well			0
' we need to put this into perspective , not every woman is going to down tools tomorrow and go freeze their eggs , and i do n’t think any company is suggesting that is what they should do , it ’s just giving them a choice			2
' to watch the video in full , got to itv.com / thismorning do you have a story about trying to conceive ? email us your story @entity168			0

@entity0 's getting her eggs frozen because time 's running out to be a mother
@entity17 star has *n't* found right man and is still *building* her career
