former @entity1 midfielder @entity0 has called some of the football his old club are playing under @entity5 ' miserable '			1
despite @entity7 taking @entity1 to third in the table so far in his first season in charge , some critics have had issues with the style of play employed by the @entity15			1
another ex-player , @entity16 , caused a stir when he compared them to a pub side earlier this season , while @entity0 also has issues			1
it was not an option ; it was an obligation			2
' in the periods of my career when i stopped passing the ball forward , or when i stopped looking for the risky pass that might open up a defence , the consequences were the same			0
the manager stopped picking me			0
i got back into the team when i went back to doing it the way he wanted			0
' @entity1 's history was built on attacking football , which does not always mean that the team kept clean sheets or did not concede chances			1
why do you think @entity1 have had some of the best goalkeepers in the world over the years ? they needed them because the team committed so many players forward			1
' it does not give me any pleasure to say that at the moment i am struggling to watch @entity5 's team with any great enjoyment			2
they beat @entity34 on wednesday night but it was @entity34 who had by far the best of the first half			0
@entity81 scored twice as @entity1 beat @entity34 in the @entity82 on wednesday night ' at times , @entity1 's football is miserable			1
to beat opposing teams you have to attack , and to attack you have to take risks			2
too few of the players in the current team are prepared to take those risks			2
' @entity0 scored 155 goals for @entity1 during their richest period of success and is at a loss to work out why @entity7 is employing captain @entity26 in midfield			1
he added : ' we come at last to the two strikers , @entity97 and @entity98			1
i feel they look like strangers at times , while @entity26 is moved around the team to accommodate them			2
' @entity26 can play anywhere on the pitch			0
he is so willing , and he will give you at least a 7/10 performance most times			0
against @entity34 he ended up as a defensive midfielder			0
at other times he has been pushed out to the right - hand side , where he will look for the strikers early or switch the play			0
' but if @entity7 does not think @entity26 is a better option up front than the other two then there really is a problem			0

@entity0 has stuck the boot into @entity1
