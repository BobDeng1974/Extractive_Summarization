trout pout : actress @entity1 had a botched lip filler injection by a doctor who used liquid silicone a shocking report has already linked anti-wrinkle dermal fillers to permanent blindness in three patients			1
now a leading cosmetic surgeon has claimed that there have been at least 30 cases of vision loss – and that the injections have also caused strokes in some patients			1
‘ these are not one - in - a - million instances , ’ claims dr @entity16 , a @entity17 - based plastic surgeon who specialises in facial procedures			1
fillers are gel - like substances that are injected under the skin to add volume and give a plump , youthful appearance			2
alongside @entity27 , they represent a third of all non-surgical cosmetic procedures carried out in @entity30			1
the value of the @entity30 cosmetic procedures market was £ 2.3 billion in 2010 , and it is estimated that figure will grow to £ 3.6 billion by 2015			1
non-surgical procedures account for 75 per cent of the total			1
yet because fillers are legally classified as implants rather than drugs , they are not subject to the same regulations , and as such they can legally be injected by anyone – trained or otherwise			2
the jabs are behind the much derided ‘ trout pout ’ phenomenon , where the gel is injected into the lips in order to enlarge the pout			0
however , the outcome can often look cartoonish and unsightly			0
depending on the type of gel used , the result – no matter how garish – can be permanent			0
in 2000 , actress @entity1 famously suffered the ‘ trout pout ’ effect after having her lips injected with liquid silicone by a @entity58 doctor			0
yet a poor cosmetic result is just a minor complication compared with the potential risks involved			2
‘ the problem comes when filler is accidentally injected into an artery , ’ explains dr @entity16			2
‘ this can lead to necrosis , or death of the skin tissue , and if they ’re the arteries that supply oxygen to the back of the eye , this can lead to loss of vision			1
in a worst - case scenario , filler can even block oxygen supply to the brain , resulting in a stroke			0
’ aside from the recent three cases of blindness , there were similar claims in 2012 – one report highlighted 32 cases , while the second study revealed 12 incidents of spontaneous , permanent vision loss after filler injections			1
there have also been at least four reported instances of stroke , in which the blockage in the blood supply leads to tissue death and brain damage			0
these were the result of filler injections of the patients ’ own fat taken from another part of their body , claims dr @entity16			1
danger jab : dr @entity108 , a @entity17 - based cosmetic surgeon , claims there has been at least 30 cases of vision loss and that fillers have caused strokes due to lack of regulation , under - reporting of complications is common , and manufacturers have no obligation to publish details of problems			1
‘ because these side effects are under - reported , many practitioners do n’t even know that there ’s a risk of them happening , let alone have a plan of action for when they do , ’ warns dr @entity16			0
in the @entity30 , more than 120 fillers are licensed for use , yet in the @entity128 only 21 can be used			1
in the @entity30 in 2010 , one filler , @entity130 , manufactured by @entity131 , was withdrawn just seven months after being licensed as patients experienced swelling and hard lumps forming beneath the skin			1
two years ago , @entity136 , the company behind the popular @entity138 fillers , advised that another of its products , @entity141 , originally designed to be used in breast augmentation , should not be used in this way because it could hamper breast cancer diagnosis			0
both incidents fuelled fears that @entity30 consumers were being used as guinea pigs			2
other doctors have raised concerns about delayed reactions to new - to - the - market fillers that can cause sudden pain and disfiguring swelling months after being injected			0
dr @entity155 , a cosmetic doctor who has clinics in @entity17 ’s @entity157 and @entity158 , says : ‘ as a trained medical professional , dealing with delayed inflammatory reactions is a challenging medical problem and i have serious concerns that less qualified practitioners might not have the requisite skills to cope , or that many may simply refuse to take responsibility for such a delayed side effect			2
’ dr @entity16 advises : ‘ you should know before your procedure exactly what is going to be injected into your face and what the side effects could be			0
‘ i suggest using only hyaluronic acid - based fillers as these can be broken down if the patient has a reaction to them , and only having fillers that have been approved in the @entity128 because they have a good safety record			0
‘ and make sure you ’re in the hands of a qualified medical professional with knowledge of the anatomy of the face			0
