it was when @entity1 met up with his former @entity3 team - mates earlier this week that it struck him just how much he had missed rugby and how glad he is to be back in the game again			1
on wednesday night , the 36 - year - old was among familiar faces at the @entity9 in @entity10 to take his place at @entity13 ’s testimonial dinner			1
the following evening , he was a world away from that glittering occasion , taking training at @entity17 - on - @entity18 in his new role as the club ’s director of rugby			1
for the ex-leicester and @entity28 flanker , @entity24 - winner and decorated @entity25 , this is the grass - roots role which has given him a taste of coaching that he is relishing , and a route back into the cut and thrust of a sporting life			1
it may be several rungs below the level he occupied during his playing career , but he is embracing the earthier surroundings of @entity42			1
@entity1 looks onto the pitches at @entity17 - on - @entity18 , where he is director of rugby spending an evening with the men he used to stand shoulder to shoulder with in the test arena reminded @entity1 about the joys of a sporting life			1
‘ seeing all those guys again , they ’re all doing totally different things , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s quite strange			0
but when you get back into that circle again , it makes you miss rugby so much			1
this really gives me the connection to the game that i need			1
’ @entity1 lives in @entity17 - on - @entity62 , having spent the last years of his playing career at nearby @entity28			1
this venture into coaching began with taking his children to the club for minis rugby and going along to train there with his brother - in - law			1
that led to some coaching input and during the summer , he was asked if the ad hoc arrangement could become more formal			0
‘ i thought , “ i love it here and i love being involved in rugby again ” , ’ he said			1
‘ i had been out of it for two years and this is much more of a grass - roots level , but the guys have so much enthusiasm			1
‘ you realise that you ca n’t have a professional mind - set , because all these lads have jobs			1
we ’ve got labourers , teachers , sportsmen , students , architects , all sorts — a really wide range of guys here			0
there ’s a full spectrum here , then you ’ve got private schools , local schools , all sorts of backgrounds			0
‘ the first time i came along to training there were eight or nine guys , now we get regularly over 20 , which is fantastic			0
it ’s an opportunity for me to get back into the sport i love and give a bit back			1
i ’m really enjoying it			0
’ there was a strong turn - out on thursday for a session on the floodlit pitch			1
@entity1 held a coaches ’ meeting in the clubhouse first , then went out to take charge of training			1
he is swiftly discovering that , in the amateur game , his official title covers a vast remit			2
former @entity3 captain @entity1 made an ad hoc arrangement at the club permanent in the summer @entity1 is relishing his connection to grassroots rugby and his first coaching role ‘ i ’m director of rugby , which covers a lot of bases — trying to organise the club a little bit more so that it is unified across the board , to create more of a one - club identity , ’ he said			1
‘ there are a lot of teams here and i ’m just trying to align them a little bit better , so we can compete			0
the guys have come up this year from the division below and it ’s tough for them			0
they have lost the first couple of games but it ’s not about being a professional club			2
it ’s about creating a strong club that everyone enjoys being part of and make it an important part of the community			2
‘ the club has only been going about 25 years and the guys running it have done a great job			1
now it ’s about taking that next step , to get more players along and get everyone enjoying their rugby			1
hopefully me being here will help — guys will want to come along to see what i ’m doing here			0
’ what he is doing is running his @entity164 coaching clinics at the club for junior players — enlisting the help of friends and contacts such as @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 — as well as taking charge of the first xv			1
there are obvious challenges for someone with @entity1 ’s elite background , but he is learning to adapt			1
‘ there are certain things that you just see as normal , like lifting for kick - offs and in the lineout , ’ he said			2
‘ as a professional player , that sort of thing is all part of the routine , but you are sort of starting from the beginning here			0
at first , i gave them far too much information , so i ’m trying to rein myself back in again			2
they are enthused by me being here but i am enthused by them , too — they just probably do n’t realise that ! ’ @entity1 is sufficiently enthused by his experience so far to be open - minded about where it might take him			1
having been busy with various projects since retiring as a player , he had not shown an inclination to explore a full - time coaching career , but now he would n’t rule it out			2
‘ i do n’t know , ’ he said , when asked about the possibility			0
‘ when i retired , i stepped away from the game because i had been in it 17 years and i did n’t want my life to just revolve around the game every weekend			1
coming here has got me enthused about the management side of the game and coaching			2
at the minute i love it			2
if something comes of it then great , but i just love it for what it is at the moment			2
’ moody in action against @entity230 at @entity231 in @entity232 in 2010 @entity1 ( right ) celebrates a @entity234 quarter - final win with @entity236 team - mate @entity235 his new role has already thrown up one difficult scenario			1
as a prominent supporter of the @entity241 ’s concussion campaign , @entity1 is well aware of the threat posed by the issue and he had to confront it in @entity17 ’s season opener at @entity246			1
‘ in our first game , we had two concussions , ’ he said			2
‘ one of the guys stepped out of the line and smashed someone with a great hit , which stopped a try , but he knocked himself out cold			0
there was me thinking , “ there ’s a decision to be made here ” but there was no real decision to be made , we knew he had to come off			0
‘ when someone questioned what he was going to do the next week , i just said , “ he ’s having three weeks off , no contact , then we ’ll assess him again ”			0
trouble is ; now that he ’s not allowed to do contact for a bit , he ’s stopped coming to training ! ‘ the other one was n’t quite as bad — he was sat on the ground feeling a bit dizzy			0
you realise how difficult it is for doctors , because he ’s on the sideline saying , “ i ’m fine , i ’m ready to go back on ”			2
we just have one physio from @entity277 , but we ’re lucky because a lot of teams at this level do n’t even have that			0
’ it was an early test of @entity1 ’s ability to handle the decision - making demands of management			1
it will be a learning process , but he ’s just glad to be back in the game again			1
