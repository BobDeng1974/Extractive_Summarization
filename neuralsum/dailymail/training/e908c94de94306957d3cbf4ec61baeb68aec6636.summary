@entity1 manager @entity0 was in the stands at @entity3 but he will have left impressed by a save from an @entity6 goalkeeper late on that ensured a goalless draw which ultimately satisfied both teams			1
@entity10 reacted quickly to block a powerful shot from @entity13 substitute @entity12 , put clear by @entity14 , and preserve a second successive clean sheet for the first time since last november			1
only six players eligible for @entity0 started this match and none are @entity1 regulars			0
of those , @entity21 impressed most , and it was he who burst forward to launch a counter-attack in the final minute before being crudely blocked by @entity25			1
in truth , two moments on the touchline did most to entertain			0
in the first half @entity76 tried to rouse misfiring winger @entity14 , who did well on his debut against @entity84 , by dancing a jig and pulling a toothy smile with his fingers			1
a short clip of @entity76 ’s performance became a hit on @entity91			1
‘ my girls will be laughing at me tonight , ’ said @entity76			1
‘ i just felt he was trying too hard			0
he had a lot of publicity last week and he was a bit tense to start here			0
he had a couple of great situations that he did n’t deliver , and that ’s not like him			0
i was trying to get him to play with a smile			0
’ there was black humour when opposing manager @entity26 was struck in a sensitive area by a water bottle flung from the hand of no 2 @entity106 during a fiery reaction to a foul by @entity64 on @entity51			2
@entity26 had booted the ball down the line in anger and as he turned back he was inadvertently caught by @entity106 ’s missile			2
the pair shared a hug and the @entity115 growled his displeasure at @entity117			0
‘ you try and tell him not to throw a water bottle , ’ joked @entity26			2
last season @entity26 ’s team struggled at home , losing a record 10 matches			2
but the mood was positive here after an opening - day win at @entity127 and with a revamped defence , @entity41 should prove robust this season			2
spectator : @entity1 manager @entity0 takes a seat at @entity3 as he contemplates who will make his next squad , which will be announced in september transfer : latest signing @entity135 midfielder @entity60 started on the bench but did make an appearance in the second half acrobatics : @entity140 defender @entity25 cartwheels through the air after a challenge from @entity41 striker @entity61 attention : @entity70 is closed down by @entity41 's @entity58 , and the @entity144 missed the visitors ' best chance in the first half mins @entity148 @entity41 total 107.2 66.6 @entity58 90 11.6 7.2 @entity21 90 10.6 6.6 @entity62 90 10.4 6.4 @entity13 total 110.3 68.5 @entity68 90 11.4 7.1 @entity64 90 11.0 6.9 @entity69 90 10.9 6.7 data courtesy of the @entity150 , the @entity151 of the @entity152 @entity51 , making his first appearance here since may 2012 , was excellent at right - back — covering across the back line and bringing the ball out with assurance — while @entity54 , signed for £ 2m , was equally strong on the other flank			1
@entity53 is continuing his fine form from the @entity160 and @entity52 looks more composed than during his troubled spell at @entity162			0
there were no shots on target for @entity41 — @entity59 ’s first - half free - kick which whistled past the post was their closest effort — but once @entity169 is back from achilles injury a genuine striking thrust should emerge			1
‘ after everybody ’s doom and gloom about the football club last season we ’ve certainly took the challenge on , ’ said @entity26			2
’ @entity13 had the majority of possession and @entity14 should have at least tested @entity10 when the ball fell to him at the far post in the 26th minute after @entity70 ’s deflected shot			1
but he side - footed wide			0
the visitors ’ best period came soon after the interval when three chances came and went			0
@entity189 ’s deep free - kick was headed back across the six - yard box by @entity25 and @entity64 connected well to force a fine save from @entity10			1
minutes later @entity64 went close again when he cut in from the right and hit crisp left - foot shot narrowly over the bar			0
then @entity14 dinked a pass to @entity25 , but he slashed wildly and missed the ball			2
‘ i thought we deserved to win , ’ said @entity76			0
‘ i felt we controlled 75 per cent of that game			0
’ after @entity10 ’s heroics and @entity25 ’s marching orders , the heavens opened and @entity41 pushed forward but failed to find the breakthrough			1
old habits die hard : @entity64 and @entity41 's assistant manager @entity106 exchange words on the touchline stare : @entity64 is n't the only person attracting @entity106 's attention as the former @entity208 midfielder talks to fourth official @entity209 blink and you 'll miss it ! referee @entity35 uses vanishing spray to mark the @entity41 wall during the @entity152 match competing for possession : @entity69 tracks back and attempts to get the ball off @entity217 in midfield aerial : @entity45 and @entity61 compete for the ball in mid-air at @entity3 in the lunchtime stalemate tackle : @entity14 , signed this summer from @entity225 side @entity223 , is tackled by @entity226 blocked : both teams had periods of dominance but ultimately they cancelled each other out as the two sides played out a 0 - 0 draw at @entity3 punch : @entity13 goalkeeper @entity63 had little to do during the match but , here , produces a good punched clearance under pressure @entity239 : @entity25 wasdisappointed to see red after an impressive performance in the heart of the visitors ' back four it ’s not too late to play @entity244 … there ’s £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager			1

@entity248 and @entity60 started on the bench for @entity41
an even first half ended goalless between @entity76 and @entity26 's sides
both @entity41 and @entity13 *enjoyed* good spells in the second half but neither could make the breakthrough
@entity12 *spurned* best chance of the game in 89th minute but foiled by @entity10
@entity25 sent off for two bookable *offences* late on
