it looked like a typical sunday morning at any mega-church			0
several hundred people , including families with small children , packed in for more than an hour of rousing music , an inspirational sermon , a reading and some quiet reflection			0
the only thing missing was god.nearly three dozen gatherings dubbed ' atheist mega-churches ' by supporters and detractors have sprung up around the @entity14 and @entity15 - with more to come - after finding success in @entity17 earlier this year			1
the movement fueled by social media and spearheaded by two prominent @entity21 comedians is no joke			1
similar gatherings in @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and other @entity14 cities have drawn hundreds of atheists seeking the camaraderie of a congregation without religion or @entity45 founders , @entity21 duo @entity27 and @entity29 , are currently on a tongue - in - cheek ' 40 dates , 40 nights ' tour around the @entity14 and @entity15 to drum up donations and help launch new sunday assemblies			1
they hope to raise more than $ 800,000 that will help atheists launch their pop - up congregations around the world			0
so far , they have raised about $ @entity57 do n't bash believers but want to find a new way to meet like - minded people , engage in the community and make their presence more visible in a landscape dominated by faith			2
@entity21 comedians @entity27 , right , and @entity29 smile as they go over their presentation before the @entity27 in @entity31 on sunday church choir : the @entity21 duo sing the song , ' @entity69 , ' by @entity70 @entity27 got the first inkling for the idea while leaving a @entity74 concert six years ago			1
' there was so much about it that i loved , but it 's a shame because at the heart of it , it 's something i do n't believe in , ' @entity27 said			1
' if you think about church , there 's very little that 's bad			2
it 's singing awesome songs , hearing interesting talks , thinking about improving yourself and helping other people - and doing that in a community with wonderful relationships			2
what part of that is not to like ? ' the movement dovetails with new studies that show an increasing number of @entity14 are drifting from any religious affiliation			1
the @entity98 released a study last year that found 20 percent of @entity14 say they have no religious affiliation , an increase from 15 percent in the last five years			1
@entity98 researchers stressed , however , that the category also encompassed majorities of people who said they believed in @entity106 but had no ties with organized religion and people who consider themselves ' spiritual ' but not ' religious			2
' congregants dance from their seats during the song filled @entity27 in @entity31 @entity27 - whose motto is @entity116 , @entity117 , wonder more - taps into that universe of people who left their faith but now miss the community church provided , said @entity123 , a professor of secular studies at @entity125 in @entity126			1
it also plays into a feeling among some atheists that they should make themselves more visible			0
for example , last december , an atheist in @entity133 created an uproar - and triggered a lawsuit - when he set up a godless display amid @entity140 nativity scenes that were part of a beloved , decades - old tradition			0
' in the @entity14 , there 's a little bit of a feeling that if you 're not religious , you 're not patriotic			1
i think a lot of secular people say , ` hey , wait a minute			0
we are charitable , we are good people , we 're good parents and we are just as good citizens as you and we 're going to start a church to prove it , ' said @entity123			1
' it 's still a minority , but there 's enough of them now			0
' that impulse , however , has raised the ire of those who have spent years pushing back against the idea that atheism itself is a religion			0
' the idea that you 're building an entire organization based on what you do n't believe , to me , sounds like an offense against sensibility , ' said @entity170 , a self - described atheist who was raised @entity173 but left when he became disillusioned			2
' there 's something not ok with appropriating all of this religious language , and ritual for atheism , ' said @entity170 , who blogged about the movement at the site policymic.com			1
a volunteer posts a sign at the @entity27 , the godless yet spirited congregation that sentiment did n't seem to detract from the excitement sunday at the inaugural meeting in @entity31			1
hundreds of atheists and atheist - curious packed into a @entity194 auditorium for a boisterous service filled with live music , moments of reflection , an " inspirational talk " about forgotten - but important - inventors and scientists and some stand - up comedy			0
during the service , attendees stomped their feet , clapped their hands and cheered as @entity27 and @entity200 led the group through rousing renditions of " @entity69 , " " @entity203 " and other hits that took the place of gospel songs			2
congregants dissolved into laughter at a get - to - know - you game that involved clapping and slapping the hands of the person next to them and applauded as members of the audience spoke about community service projects they had started in @entity31			2
at the end , volunteers passed cardboard boxes for donations as attendees mingled over coffee and pastries and children played on the floor			0
for atheist @entity228 , the morning was perfect			0
' i think the image that we have put forward in a lot of ways has been a scary , mean , we want to tear down the walls , we want to do destructive things kind of image is what a lot of people have of us , " he said			0
" i 'm really excited to be able to come together and show that it 's not about destruction			0
it 's about making things and making things better			0
' an attendee grabs a witty slogan filled brochure at the @entity27 a photo of one of the earliest sunday assemblies in @entity250 in march after the @entity21 duo started their atheist church , organizations all over the @entity14 an @entity15 are wondering how they can start their own branch			1

@entity21 duo @entity27 and @entity29 wanted to form a strong community without the need for religious beliefs
the movement becomes popular as new studies show that an increasing number of @entity14 are drifting away from religious affiliations
' we are just as good citizens as you and we 're going to start a church just to prove it , ' said *college* professor @entity123
