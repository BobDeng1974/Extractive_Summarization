with each passing day at @entity1 , @entity0 is witnessing the continuing revival of a natural - born leader			1
the end product will benefit @entity6 ’s ambitions every bit as much as those harboured at the @entity9			1
@entity0 was thrilled when @entity10 chose the @entity1 as the club at which to continue his career following 342 appearances for @entity14			1
@entity0 , pictured scoring in the @entity16 , was delighted when @entity10 signed for @entity1 this month @entity10 ( left ) , in action in last saturday 's draw against @entity19 , was ' born a leader ' according to @entity0 @entity10 ( left ) and @entity0 ( right ) have played together numerous times for @entity6 all those phone calls to his international colleague – badgering him to make the move – were not in vain			1
the recent years of @entity10 ’s career have , of course , been scarred by the chronic bowel condition that so drained his health before surgery provided the right path back to top - level football			1
to then leave @entity14 , whom he joined as a schoolboy and won five @entity37 titles with , must have been an emotional wrench			1
but the exit has opened the way to regain the kind of regular action that will delight national boss @entity43 as he ponders the remainder of the @entity46 qualification campaign			2
@entity10 was promptly made captain of his new club side by manager @entity49 and is undefeated in three appearances to date			1
his positive influence is being felt every bit as much in the dressing - room as it is in central midfield			2
the 31 - year - old was an excellent servant to @entity14 , making 342 appearances in all competitions @entity10 ( left ) , pictured signing a contract extension in 2005 , has a good relationship with @entity61 ( right ) ‘ some people are born captains , really , ’ insisted @entity0			1
‘ we have a good bunch of lads at @entity1 , so that respect was there			1
‘ it was up to the manager to change the captaincy and @entity10 has been great since he arrived			1
he has settled in fantastically well			2
he has already been getting the lads together so he has done a good job so far			2
the former @entity14 midfielder opens up to @entity76 's @entity75 in an exclusive interview about his crippling stomach illness ‘ he has n’t really changed things			1
he has just been himself			2
he leads the lads out , shouts orders and gets us up for games			0
' when he has settled a bit more , then i ’m sure he will further stamp his authority in terms of what he wants at the club			0
he leads by example and does everything right			0
‘ on the pitch , he brings so much experience and energy			0
obviously , the players we have in the @entity1 midfield are all experienced but i think @entity10 ’s presence rubs off on the other lads			1
it gets us playing well			0
‘ can he get back to his best ? i think he can			0
i know what type of character he is so i have no doubts about that			0
just give him a few more games under his belt and he ’ll be back to his best			0
‘ the more games @entity10 plays , the more his level will rise , as will his fitness and confidence			1
a fit @entity10 is a really good player			1
’ in december the then @entity14 midfielder opened up to @entity76 's @entity75 about his illness @entity10 , in action for his country in a @entity46 qualifying match in september , only recently turned 31 @entity10 only turned 31 earlier this month , so his free - transfer acquisition might well prove one of the biggest bargains to be found in the cash - crazed @entity121 top - flight			1
‘ @entity10 was at one of the best clubs in the world so it was a big coup for @entity1 to get him , ’ admitted @entity0			1
‘ it shows @entity10 just wanted to play football , although there were family reasons as well and stuff like that			1
‘ i ’ve known him for a long time and i know what he ’s all about			0
when i heard there was a chance of him coming , i was on the phone to him , trying to get him here			0
i want to play with good players and @entity10 is certainly that			2
‘ how did i sell the club ? i had my ways ! i just said it was a real family club with great support			0
basically it was all about the lads here and i knew he would fit in right away and he has			2
' he ’s enjoying it , he told me that himself			0
i knew he would like the manager and he ’s played a big part in it for @entity152 , too			2
@entity49 has done a great job so far			2
’ the same could be said for @entity43 as @entity6 prepare to resume their bid to reach @entity156 with a @entity158 qualifier against group minnows @entity160 late next month			1
@entity0 knows the task of taking on a side routed by @entity163 and the @entity164 will be all about mentality			1
@entity6 skipper @entity10 ( left ) has made three appearances for the @entity1 since joining the club @entity0 ( middle ) knows history is not on @entity6 's side ahead of the imminent @entity46 qualifiers after all , @entity6 do n’t exactly have a great history against teams they are supposed to wipe the floor with			1
‘ we ’ll prepare for @entity160 in the same way we have for every game , ’ insisted @entity0 , who was speaking on behalf of @entity6 team sponsor @entity178			1
‘ you ca n’t slack off in football because that ’s when it bites you on the backside			0
you ’ve got to be professional			0
with @entity43 , we ’ve been really switched on and professional ‘ i remember i played against @entity186 in the @entity16 with @entity187 and that was a 1 - 1 draw			2
i think that ’s the only really big upset that i ’ve played in			2
' that was a typical @entity16 game , a really good occasion and we did the job in the replay the following week			0
hopefully we do our job against @entity160			0
‘ you just have to ride the occasion and beat what ’s in front of you			0
with the players in our team i do n’t think [ a shock ] will happen			2
we ’re all looking forward to the game			0
‘ for me it would be a dream come true to play in a major tournament			0
the biggest thing , though , is getting there			0
we ’ve had a great start but that ’s all it is			0
we ’ve got a long way to go			0
but i sense everyone is together and pulling in the right direction			0

@entity1 signed @entity10 on a free transfer earlier this month
@entity6 team - mate @entity0 regarded the move as a huge coup for @entity49 ' side
@entity0 knew @entity10 well prior to the move as the pair have played together for @entity6
the *28* - year - old says the former @entity14 man was ' born a captain '
