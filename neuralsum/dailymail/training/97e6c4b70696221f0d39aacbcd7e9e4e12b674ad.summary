by @entity0 and @entity1 the help to buy scheme could net the government £ 4.5billion because of a house price boom - even though the boom has partly been blamed on the scheme itself			1
the @entity9 is on track to receive a vast windfall because of a clause allowing it to share the cash from homes which are sold on at a profit			1
help to buy hands buyers 20 per cent of a home 's value - and when the house is sold with the loan still active , the government takes 20 per cent of any increase over the years			1
windfall : the government could make £ 4.5billion from the help to buy scheme , research has claimed because of the explosion in @entity27 house prices , the government will make a 59 per cent return on its loans over the scheme 's lifetime , research by the @entity33 claimed today			1
that means by 2020 , when the scheme is due to end , the @entity9 will have handed out enough loans to net itself £ 4.5billion			2
launched in march 2013 to help first - time buyers of new - build homes who could not afford a deposit it aimed to kick - start housing market buyers stump up as little as 5 % on a mortgage which carries a 25 % deposit @entity9 loans the buyer the other 20 % , interest - free for five years if house is sold after rising in value , @entity9 wins 20 % of the difference but if it has fallen in value , @entity9 pays 20 % of the difference instead a second scheme , nicknamed help to buy 2 , is also available and involves state guarantees on loans for any type of property - not just new builds neither can be used for interest - only mortgages or buy - to - lets but the windfall is controversial because the recent surge in house prices has partially been blamed on the help to buy scheme itself			1
critics say it is inflating prices by encouraging more houses to be sold without new ones being built , which was the original aim of the scheme			0
local government committee chairman @entity73 , who has attacked the scheme as ' dangerous ' , told the @entity33 : ' what would reassure people is if the government said they would take any profits and reinvest them in new homes , that would represent a substantial building programme			2
' and he wrote previously : ' the very last thing we should be doing is fueling inflation in a still over-priced market and , thus , actually disabling even more families from becoming owner - occupiers			0
' but the government has not said whether it will reinvest the money directly into building new homes			0
a @entity9 spokesman told the @entity33 it had ' a direct financial interest in the help to buy scheme and an increasing interest in the tax revenues generated from the housing market '			2
the @entity33 arrived at its figures by assuming all houses bought under the scheme would be sold after five years			0
it based the total on the £ 184,000 average selling price of homes so far , and the government 's ambition to lend to 25,000 people a year			1
controversial : the windfall is caused when house prices rise - but the help to buy scheme itself has been partly blamed for a housing boom			1
mp @entity73 ( left ) said profits should be reinvested in new - build homes @entity114 could be triggering a house price boom making it even harder to get on the ladder in the first place many homes bought under the initial scheme would have been built anyway , meaning it is not boosting house - building as it was intended extending the scheme to include houses which are not new builds will not help boost the housebuilding industry middle - class parents could ' hijack ' scheme to invest through their children however , the profits will reach government coffers extremely slowly as they only become available when houses are sold			1
and the scheme is not without its risks			0
the government takes 20 per cent of profits when a house rises in value - but also has to stump up 20 per cent of the loss if it falls			1
help to buy loans are also interest - free for five years , which reduces the amount of money the government makes			0
the scheme began last march and had a major test this week when figures were released for its first full financial year			0
they showed the government loaned £ 791million to 19,394 buyers - less than the 25,000 - a - year target			1
some areas of the country have benefited far more than others , according to analysis by @entity152			0
in many of the wealthiest @entity156 boroughs - including @entity157 and @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 - not a single help to buy loan appears to have been issued all year			2
that contrasts sharply with @entity167 , which with 337 was the council area with the most help to buy loans in the last year			2
it was followed closely by @entity172 with 316 , @entity173 with 287 and @entity174 with 282			0
the most help to buy loans per head , meanwhile , were given out in @entity177 - which had one loan for every 570 residents			0
it was followed by @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 .			0

@entity9 is set to receive the windfall through its own house loan **policy**
it takes 20 % of price rise when homes bought through @entity191 are sold
but profit is controversial because the same scheme is blamed for ' *bubble* '
government has already loaned £ *800million* in the **policy** 's first year
vast areas of @entity156 have not had a single loan - but @entity167 has had 337
