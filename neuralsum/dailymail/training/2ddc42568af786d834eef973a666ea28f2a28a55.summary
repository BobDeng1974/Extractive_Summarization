the hotels industry is concerned competition for bookings will fall when @entity9 global travel booking giant @entity10 takes control of @entity1 by the end of october			1
the takeover will concentrate @entity4 's online travel booking market into the hands of just two companies - @entity10 and fellow @entity9 giant @entity17 , which owns @entity18 and @entity19			1
industry spokesman @entity20 said the two operators would now control around 85 per cent of the market , which would likely result in hotels being charged more to advertise their rooms			2
mr @entity26 said booking websites in the @entity9 and @entity28 , where @entity17 and @entity10 dominate , typically charge commissions of between 18 and 25 per cent , compared to @entity4 's commissions of around 12 per cent			1
' the end effect is that @entity4 hotel rooms could end up more expensive as a result of this decision , ' he said			0
but the @entity35 said it would not oppose the deal			0

' the @entity35 considered that the acquisition was unlikely to diminish the dynamic nature of the industry , ' he said			0
' @entity50 developments from smaller online travel agents and from companies in related online sectors , such as the metasearch providers , can be expected to constrain @entity10 in the future			0
