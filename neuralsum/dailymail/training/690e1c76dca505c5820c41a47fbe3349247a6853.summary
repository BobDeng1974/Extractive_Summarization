published : 18:24 est , 3 november 2013 updated : 18:24 est , 3 november 2013 three people have been arrested in @entity1 after one was shot in the back during an alleged @entity5 hunting quest in a case that has baffled police			1
it all started on saturday night when a man called 911 saying that he 'd accidentally shot his friend			1
the pair claimed to have been on a @entity5 hunting expedition on the corner of 177th @entity14 and @entity15 in @entity16			1
one of the men , @entity18 , told police he flinched after hearing a ' barking noise ' and accidentally shot his friend in the back			1
' when you start off with an explanation like that do you believe anything after that ? ' @entity27 told @entity1 's @entity28 9			1
adding to the inconsistent stories , @entity18 's wife , @entity29 , 22 , told police that someone else had shot at her husband			1
proof ? there is still debate over the existence of the @entity5 and grainy photos such as this one are often dismissed as hoaxes			1
this latest story has done nothing to add any light on the existence of @entity5 hardly hunting territory : the @entity5 hunters claim to have been here , on the corner of 177th @entity14 and @entity15 , when they were searching for the @entity5 , resulting in one being shot			1
police do not believe their story police say that drugs and alcohol may been involved			1
the men met emergency responders at a @entity54 convenience store near @entity55 and 161st street after the shooting			0
@entity18 , 21 , was arrested for reckless conduct with a firearm and obstruction			2
deputies also arrested @entity61 , @entity18 's father - in - law			2
@entity61 threw his son - in - law 's gun in a pond on the property because he is a convicted felon and was afraid to have the gun on his property , the @entity62 said			0
@entity61 , 53 , was booked on complaints of felon in possession of a firearm and destruction of evidence			0
deputies arrested @entity29 as well for obstruction because of her account of events			0
believable ? there is no shortness of images mocking up what @entity5 might look like should he exist			2
the @entity5 hunting craze was reignited recently after new ' evidence ' was found			2
however the findings turned out to be bear hair the shooting victim was not charged and is expected to survive			0
@entity27 said they will continue to investigate the incident			0
' it probably was an accidental shooting , ' @entity27 said			0
' our efforts now are to locate the weapon that was used			0
' whether the group were hunting or not , the @entity5 search craze was recently reignited after scientists claimed to have found evidence the creature exists			2
however the ' evidence ' turned out to be the hair of a rare species of bear			0
that does n't seem to have stopped avid hunters from continuing to try and find the elusive @entity105 .			0
