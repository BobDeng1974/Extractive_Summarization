the boss of the @entity1 has admitted that it could be years before taxpayers get their money back			1
as the state - backed lender announced a seventh consecutive year of huge losses , @entity5 could offer little assurance to households who contributed to its £ 46 billion bailout in 2008			1
the @entity12 said it was ‘ certainly not going to be months ’ before the bank was ready to return to the private sector , before adding it would be ‘ much shorter ’ than ten years			0
’ the bleak prognosis came as @entity1 , which is 79 per cent owned by taxpayers , slumped to a £ 3.5bn loss last year			1
this takes its total losses since its collapse to almost £ 50bn , and the news wiped more than £ 1bn off the bank ’s value as shares fell more than 4 per cent to 386.6p			2
expectations had been high that @entity1 could be returning to normality , having made a £ 2.6bn profit in the first half of the year , but a £ 2.2bn bill for fines and litigation and a £ 4bn charge on its @entity47 business have blown it off course			1
the huge loss is also a setback for @entity51 , who had been hoping both @entity1 and @entity52 would be back in the black before the election			0
it also came as another pay row flared up , with @entity1 dishing out £ 483 million in bonuses to staff – although this was down from £ 576m the previous year			2
mr @entity5 , who forfeited a £ 1 million shares payment for the second year running after taking the helm in october 2013 , said the bonus culture was ‘ not something i am going to change or can change today ’			2
he added : ‘ i need to be in a position to pay fair pay for people to do these jobs			0
there are some fairly technical jobs that we need to get right			0
’ but mr @entity51 said the bank must go further to curb pay			0
the @entity1 news will be a disappointment to chancellor @entity51 , picture , wanted the see the bailed - out bank back in the black in advance of the election in a letter to sir @entity80 , the boss of the @entity81 who was confirmed yesterday as @entity1 ’s new chairman , he said : ‘ i look to you and @entity5 personally to ensure that the entirety of the bank ’s business is conducted to the very highest ethical standards			1
’ he added that his priorities included turning @entity1 into ‘ a @entity90 bank focused on the @entity90 economy , with lower bonuses and with a plan to get the taxpayers ’ money back ’			0
last night @entity96 mp , the shadow financial secretary to the treasury , said : ‘ while it ’s good that @entity5 has taken a lead on rejecting his allowance , people will be taken aback at the scale of bonuses			0
’ former chairman sir @entity104 said it was ‘ like @entity106 ’ , adding that the bank ’s litigation charges – which turned a £ 3.5bn profit into the huge loss – had overshadowed a ‘ really impressive year of achievement ’ .			1

@entity1 yesterday announced the seventh year of consecutive losses
bank chief executive @entity5 said the firm has lost £ 3.5bn last year
he had admitted it would ' not be months ' before the bank could be sold off
the taxpayer *pumped* £ *46billion* into the troubled bank after the 2008 crash
