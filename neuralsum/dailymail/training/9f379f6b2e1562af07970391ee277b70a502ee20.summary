by @entity0 last updated at 2:48 pm on 16th november 2011 life - saving operation : @entity2 , 20 , almost died when fluid began spurting out of her head during an emergency operation @entity2 , 20 , almost died when a huge cyst in her brain filled with fluid - and burst when surgeons drilled open her skull to operate			1
the fluid began to pour from @entity2 's brain during the operation , but doctors carried on with the surgery and saved her life			1
@entity2 has had an arachnoid cyst and excess fluid in her brain since she was born			1
she has undergone brain surgery 15 times at @entity19 - but has now been told by doctors she is unlikely to need any more major surgery for years			1
the college student , from @entity22 , @entity23 , said : ' i could n't believe it when i was told what had happened during my surgery - i do n't think the doctors had ever had to dodge brain fluid during an operation before			1
' i 'm told i was lucky to survive after such high pressure in my brain			2
i ca n't thank the doctors and nurses who saved my life enough			1
' despite making a full recovery , @entity2 still relies on a shunt inserted into her brain to keep her alive - which drains fluid directly into her heart - to prevent it collecting in her skull			1
her condition is so severe that doctors spotted a dark mass on her brain before she was even born - on an ultrasound scan			2
just months after she was born , @entity2 's mum noticed one side of her head growing faster than the other - and a brain scan revealed she was suffering from an arachnoid cyst			1
the cyst was already too big to remove , and surgeons inserted the shunt into @entity2 's brain to drain the fluid			1
@entity2 said : ' i 've known about my condition all my life , so i 've been used to going in and out of hospital for operations			2
' i went for a routine check up the day before i started college , and doctors noticed a lot of pressure behind my eye - and discovered my optic nerve had been bleeding			2
@entity2 is still suffering , she said : ' one day i 'll feel perfectly normal , but the next i might not be able to get out of bed due to blinding headaches ' ' i 'd already had a shunt implanted in my head as a child that was supposed to drain fluid away - but it had somehow broken , and fluid was building up fast			1
' they told me i needed an emergency operation for surgeons to release the pressure , as the cyst was growing bigger and bigger			2
' if it got any bigger , it could have caused brain damage			0
' if my shunt stops draining , i have four hours to get treated before things get very dangerous			0
' i 've since found out there was so much fluid under pressure in my head it had literally exploded when surgeons opened up my skull			0
recovery process : @entity2 has undergone brain surgery 15 times at @entity19 , but still manages to stay upbeat a shunt is a delicate piece of equipment that 's prone to malfunction , usually through blockage or infection			1
it 's estimated that up to 4 out of 10 shunts will malfunction in the first year after surgery			0
sometimes a scan carried out after the operation shows that the shunt is n't in the best position , and that further surgery may be needed to reposition @entity109 a baby or child has a shunt fitted , the shunt may become too small as your child grows , and it will need to be replaced			2
as most people need to have a shunt for the rest of their life , more than one replacement may be @entity120 's estimated that most children with hydrocephalus may have an average of two procedures for shunt problems before they 're 10 years @entity127 shunt blockage can be very serious because it can lead to an excess build - up of fluid on the brain , which can cause brain damage			1
shunt infection is also a relatively common complication			0
the risk of infection can be around 3 - 15 % and is more likely to occur during the first few months after surgery			0
source : @entity138 ' when i 'd recovered , a nurse told me the minute the surgeon had drilled into my skull , the fluid came spurting out - and he had to jump out of the way			0
' @entity2 slipped into a coma following the operation , and doctors told her terrified mum she might not survive			1
over the next week , she had four further operations on her brain , but amazingly , managed to pull through			0
surgeons were eventually able to fit another brain shunt			0
and after a further 15 months of operations and hospital appointments , she was finally able to start a college course			0
@entity2 said : ' i try to just get on with things , but the condition does affect my day - to - day life quite a lot			2
' one day i 'll feel perfectly normal , but the next i might not be able to get out of bed due to blinding headaches and pressure behind my eyes making it painful to see anything bright - even daylight			0
' sometimes i wake up with a headache and feel well enough to go to college , but within a few hours i have such a crippling pain in my head it feels like it is going to burst			0
' however , my new shunt has now been problem - free for two years , which is a good sign , as 50 per cent of shunts fail within 24 months			0
' i hope now i 'll be one of the lucky ones - and my shunt could last me a good 25 years before i 'll need another operation			0

@entity2 has had an arachnoid cyst and excess fluid in her brain since birth which has been operated on 15 times
she said : ' i do n't think the doctors had ever had to dodge brain fluid during an operation before '
