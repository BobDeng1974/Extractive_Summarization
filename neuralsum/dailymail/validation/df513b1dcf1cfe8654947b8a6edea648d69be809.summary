a dating website which claims to cater for only the world 's best looking single people has dumped more than 3,000 members for letting themselves go			1
the cull was conducted by @entity5 of members whose looks they say no longer come up to the ' rigorous standards expected ' of the ' exclusive community ' and who now need to look for love elsewhere			1
one member , @entity12 , from @entity13 who previously underwent a make - over herself so that she could win a place on the site says she is glad they are being so tough			2
@entity12 ( pictured ) says if they did not make the cuts people would leave @entity12 , who poses seductively in a bikini for her profile pictures said : ' if the management failed to maintain the quality of the site by polluting the gene pool , most members would leave			1
' it would make beautiful people just like every other dating site - full of the kind of people you would n't want to share an elevator with , let alone date			1
' the most often cited reason for members being removed from the site were piling on the pounds and ' graceless ' ageing			1
more than @entity40 , the second largest nationality , were among those axed			0
the people behind the website say they cull has sent a ' very clear message ' to its good - looking members : ' you do n't just need to be beautiful to join ; you need to stay that way , or you are out			2
' the global website periodically reviews the suitability of all its members , to make sure that quality is maintained			0

since then there have been over 7.5million people rejected from the site			1
@entity12 was previously kicked off the site herself but had a make - over so she could stay , now she says that the site needs to keep their standards up @entity12 , was originally rejected by the members of beautifulpeople.com but underwent a make - over so that she could use it managing director mr @entity66 said : ' if members fail to maintain their beautiful appearance , we take the most recent photos of them and put them back in the rating system			2
' they are forced to go through the same 48 - hour rating process as when they initially applied , where once again they are judged by their peers			0
@entity86 : 59 ' if their looks are n't up to our members ' exacting standards and they do not secure a majority of positive votes , then their profiles are immediately removed			1
' mrs @entity55 said : ' this may sound harsh , and it is the most difficult part of managing the business			0
' we take no pleasure in removing members , but it is a necessary evil in order to maintain the beautiful community and our prized business model			0
' mr @entity66 added : ' we regret the loss of any member , but the fact remains that our members demand the high standard of beauty be upheld			0
' letting unattractive people populate the site would compromise the very concept for which @entity5 was founded			1
' he said that , as ruthless as it may sound , the website has been ' kind ' in breaking the news to former members			0
mr @entity66 added : ' each has received an email encouraging them to re-apply when they are back looking their best			0
' they are also offering free mentoring with one of the site 's beauty mentors , who have volunteered to give their time to help improve the looks , style and confidence of anyone who wants join or rejoin the site			1
