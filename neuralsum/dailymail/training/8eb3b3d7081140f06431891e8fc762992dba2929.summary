by @entity0 published : 07:43 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 08:33 est , 13 march 2013 a 20 - year - old man died from swine flu and pneumonia after a senior nurse at @entity5 told him to go to the chemist instead of @entity7			1
the unnamed man , known only as @entity9 , had called the hotline twice in two days complaining of diarrhoea and vomiting for six days			1
he also described a chesty cough and discoloured mucous			1
but rather than following the advice on the computer , which said the man should go to @entity7 , @entity18 , a senior nurse advisor for @entity19 , instead told the caller to get cough syrup from the chemist and treat himself			1
wrong diagnosis : a 20 - year - old man died from swine flu and pneumonia on after a senior nurse at @entity5 told him to go to the chemist instead of @entity7 ms @entity18 , 59 , from @entity27 , @entity19 , will now be struck off the nursing register after being found guilty of a string of professional misconduct charges by a @entity32 fitness to practice panel			1
this was one of seven counts of misconduct taken into consideration by the panel			2
other accusations included failing to provide the correct care to patients complaining of chest pain , palpitations and breathing difficulties			0
the panel heard that on christmas day 2010 she ignored advice from the system that the @entity9 should go straight to @entity7 due to the severity of his symptoms			1
with @entity5 , operators offer advice based on the symptoms described through a computer system			1
the panel 's report of the hearing said : ' on both occasions , ms @entity18 advised that @entity9 should seek pharmacy advice and self - medicate			2
' the panel was informed that @entity9 was admitted to hospital the following day , @entity65 , but died later that day following a provisional diagnosis of pneumonia secondary to @entity68 ( swine flu )			1
the report added : ' there is evidence of lack of insight and a lack of engagement			0
further , the panel considers that there is a real risk of repetition of ms @entity18 's failings which could lead to patient harm			2
' struck off : ms @entity18 was deemed no longer fit to practice at a hearing of the @entity32 indeed , the panel heard that ms @entity18 had been monitored by managers since march that year after a series of unsatisfactory calls			0
the report continued : ' it is the panel 's finding that a period of suspension would not be sufficient to protect patients			2
' the panel considers that a striking off order is the only sanction that is sufficient to protect patients and the public interest			0
' the seriousness of the case , including the number and wide - ranging nature of the incidents , is incompatible with ongoing registration			0
' ms @entity18 , who worked for @entity5 since 2001 , claimed during the probe that the problems were down to changes with the system in 2009			0
she is also said to have refused to cooperate with the investigation or attend the hearing in @entity110			0
she was given 28 days to appeal the decision before the strike off .			0

unnamed patient called hotline due to diarrhoea and vomiting , chesty cough and discoloured mucous
senior nurse who spoke to him ignored the computer 's advice about going to @entity7 and sent him to chemist
@entity128 died the next day after being *rushed* to hospital
