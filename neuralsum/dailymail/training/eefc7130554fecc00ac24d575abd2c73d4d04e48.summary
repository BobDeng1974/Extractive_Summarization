the @entity16 , which revealed last week how @entity2 and his wife @entity17 had missed out on becoming sir @entity2 and ‘ @entity18 ’ , has learned that the gong was approved by the secretive group headed by @entity3 that deals with sports stars ’ honours			1
but that decision was unexpectedly overturned when it was passed to the main @entity25 , chaired by the head of the @entity27 , sir @entity28			1
with lord @entity3 also a member of the main committee , @entity2 ’s award was expected to have been rubber - stamped			2
but a fierce debate erupted at a meeting in november			1
several committee members argued that 38 - year - old @entity2 should be made to wait longer , with one claiming there was a danger of ‘ the @entity38 effect ’ getting out of hand - a reference to last year ’s knighthood for cyclist @entity41			1
however , others pointed out that unlike @entity38 , 33 , @entity2 ’s sporting career is over following his retirement from playing football last may			2
one source said : ‘ it was unfair to say this was too soon			0
it was more than six years ago that he helped @entity7 win the right to host the @entity6			2
made to wait : @entity2 with wife @entity17 - who this year missed out on becoming sir @entity2 and ' @entity18 ' ‘ the faceless wonders who decide honours are happy to dole them out to time - serving politicians but not sports heroes who have achieved far more			0
’ however , another insider countered : ‘ senior figures in the sports world expressed concern about awards going to too many sportsmen too soon after @entity38 was knighted - and @entity3 was aware of that			0
’ the honours system is shrouded in secrecy and overseen by the @entity66 and @entity67			0
the identity of those who make nominations , widened in recent years to include members of the public , is kept secret			0
lord @entity3 had said the @entity73 believed a knighthood for @entity2 was justified in view of his success on the football field and his support for @entity7 ’s successful bid to host the @entity6			1
as leader of the @entity81 , @entity3 had first - hand experience of @entity2 ’s contribution when they travelled to @entity85 together in 2007 for the crucial vote			0
other members of the @entity73 who had backed @entity2 included former @entity89 football manager @entity88 and @entity91 gold medallist @entity90 .			0

a group led by @entity3 had approved a knighthood for the football *legend*
it would *recognise* his sporting *skill* , and efforts in the 2102 @entity6 bid
but the @entity25 , which @entity3 also sits on , said that he must wait
there was a fierce debate when the *ruling* was made in november
