by @entity0 published : 14:59 est , 22 march 2013 updated : 19:05 est , 22 march 2013 the @entity2 owner of @entity3 launched an attack on @entity5 plans to restrict press freedom , just days after his newspaper gave full support to the proposals			1
@entity10 , who also owns the @entity11 , said : ‘ the restrictions of the @entity13 in @entity14 – i would think that would be a very wrong decision			1
‘ there are better ways to rectify the wrong things that have been done during the hacking affair			1
’ @entity10 warned that press regulation would be a bad thing for the @entity14 media earlier this week , @entity3 ’s editor @entity24 was the only national newspaper editor to back the @entity26 scheme for press regulation			1
he said : ‘ this is n’t perfect but neither is it terrible			1
i do n’t see anything in it that will threaten the sort of journalism we produce at @entity3			1
’ but by thursday the newspaper was expressing serious doubts , its leader column talking of ‘ potentially critical flaws ’ in the proposals			2
the @entity3 editor @entity24 expressed support for the @entity26 earlier this week meanwhile the veteran @entity43 - supporting magazine @entity42 yesterday became the latest well - known periodical to reject the @entity26 , saying ‘ we will not be signing up to any new procedure for imposing @entity46 ’			1
education secretary @entity47 also joined the chorus of criticism , saying the clampdown on the @entity51 in the wake of the phone - hacking scandal is having a ‘ chilling effect ’ on free speech			2
in a sign of growing @entity58 unease , mr @entity47 also said he was ‘ uncomfortable ’ about the controversial deal stitched up by the three main party leaders last sunday to introduce a new press regulator			2
and he warned that the arrests of dozens of journalists , public officials and whistleblowers posed a serious potential threat to free speech			2
his intervention came as pressure group hacked @entity70 announced an embarrassing climbdown over aspects of the government ’s @entity26 on press regulation , which it helped draw up			1
the group , whose directors include the actor @entity79 , called for changes to remove a ‘ glitch ’ in the proposals that would leave thousands of internet bloggers facing the threat of ruinous damages			2
it came just days after prominent hacked off supporter @entity87 said the government should be able to ‘ cut off the wires ’ of @entity91 publications that erred			1
speaking to @entity93 ’s @entity92 , mr @entity47 , a former senior journalist at the @entity94 , contrasted the clampdown on the @entity51 with the lack of arrests in the wake of other scandals , such as the banking collapse or the deaths of up to 1,200 patients at @entity103			2
@entity70 , led by @entity79 ( pictured ) have called for a change in the charter to exclude small bloggers @entity107 and @entity108 have also been prominent campaigners for restrictions on the press he said @entity113 had secured the ‘ best deal available ’ , given @entity43 and the @entity114 had ganged up to back new press laws			1
but he indicated he remained deeply uneasy about the threat to free speech			0
he said : ‘ the free press is one of the historic strengths of this country			0
sometimes it is raucous and , as a politician , you can sometimes be on the receiving end – so you should			0
‘ a free press should hold people to account			0
that is why i am uncomfortable about politicians themselves deciding how the @entity51 should be regulated			0
my view is a minority in the @entity133			0
’ he added : ‘ we have had scores of journalists arrested – i suspect some will face their day in court			0
the @entity3 expressed support for the royal charter when most national newspapers did n't ‘ i do n’t know how many people responsible for some of the banking scandals which cause so much misery to so many have been arrested			1
‘ i ’ve seen no arrests when there have been other scandals from @entity149 and elsewhere where people have suffered			0
‘ we are in danger – with a newspaper industry which is suffering commercially – of driving to the margins the organs of free speech			0
‘ frankly it is more important that politicians fear proper scrutiny than that the press fear politicians scrutinising them			0
’ @entity160 yesterday appealed to the newspaper industry not to boycott the scheme , adding : ‘ i hope when tempers cool a bit and the dust settles , people will see it ’s the middle way			0
’ thousands of internet bloggers have come together under the umbrella campaign @entity168 , calling for small publications to be excluded from the proposals			0
it even has the backing of @entity43 ’s deputy chairman @entity173 , who has led the campaign for press regulation			0
@entity58 peer @entity176 last night tabled an amendment to the @entity179 which would remove individual @entity91 bloggers and most small publishers from the provisions of the @entity26			1
the government has not yet indicated whether it will support the change			1
meanwhile former @entity114 leader @entity185 will today accuse mr @entity113 of making a colossal ‘ strategic blunder ’ in pulling out of talks on the creation of a new press regulator .			0
