by @entity0 an @entity2 entrepreneur is revolutionising the cost of private education for parents by offering last - minute discounts for their child 's education			1
in a world - first , 25 - year - old @entity10 has partnered with a number of @entity2 's leading independent schools to offer parents between 10 and 40 per cent off the price of their child 's enrollment via @entity18			1
the idea , similar to travel website @entity21 , came to @entity10 who wanted to apply the ease of the travel website to the complexity and expense of private school placements			1
the aim is to give parents flexibility and choice while helping them overcome the inflating costs of private education			0
it also eliminates the need to cue a child for a competitive private school placement from as early as birth			1
' the high cost of running schools is growing faster than family incomes , ' @entity18 ceo @entity36 said			0
' the kinds of fee increases we ’ve seen in recent years just are n’t sustainable			0
' @entity42 and @entity66 schools which have registered pay a commission to the site when a vacancy becomes available ' similar to what a travel agent might charge you for booking a holiday , ' ms @entity36 said			1
some of the @entity66 - based independent schools where parents can send their child for a reduced price of between 10 and 40 per cent it allows parents to enroll their student at the last - minute without having to ' lock them in ' to the private education system at an early age			1
' while many parents prefer to lock in their options well ahead of time , @entity18 caters to those who prefer to keep their options open or who need to find a new school in a hurry			0
' among the schools with quoted reductions are @entity93 in @entity95 's @entity94 , @entity96 in in @entity95 's north and several other @entity66 colleges			0
parents can ' claim ' a vacancy for their year 11 child at @entity103 in 2015 for an annual fee of $ 17,000 - a reduction of 15 per cent on the full fee			1
the same institution also offers a reduction of 15 per cent on year 7 entrants - the hardest year group to find a place - at a cost of $ 15,300			2
if the same year 7 student was to enroll for the rest of the 2014 year now , it would cost a parent $ 10,800			0
at @entity96 in the city 's north school places has 30 per cent reductions on a year 11 spot , however its prices are not quoted			2
in some cases parents can make savings of up to $ 8,000 off a child 's yearly fee			0
other schools in the system are @entity129 in @entity42 , and @entity130 and @entity131 in @entity66			2
for a full list of schools , and to claim a spot visit @entity132			0

the website offers discounts between 10 and 40 per cent on annual fees
parents can ' claim ' a place on school places at the last - minute if an *availability* *matches* their *search*
*availabilities* are offered from *preschool* to year 12 in @entity42 and @entity66
it works similar to travel site @entity21 by removing the hassle of finding a private school placement
