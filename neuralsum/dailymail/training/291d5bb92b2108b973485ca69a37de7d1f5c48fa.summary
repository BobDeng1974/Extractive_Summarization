by @entity0 , @entity1 one man 's quest to explain his brother 's mysterious jail cell death 19 years ago has rekindled long - dormant questions about whether others were involved in the 1995 @entity9 bombing			1
what some consider a far - flung conspiracy theory will be at the forefront during a trial set to begin monday in @entity15			0
the @entity17 lawsuit was brought by @entity15 attorney @entity18 against the @entity19			1
he says the agency wo n't release security camera videos that show a second person was with @entity23 when he parked a truck outside the @entity9 federal building and detonated a bomb , killing 168 people			1
the government claims @entity23 was alone			2
@entity18 believes the presence of a second suspect in the truck explains why his brother , @entity18 , was flown to @entity52 several months after the bombing , where he died in a federal holding cell in what was labeled a suicide			1
what do they know ? the @entity19 claims @entity23 was alone when he planted the car bomb that killed 168 in 1995 , but some conspiracy theorists believe @entity18 died as part of the agency 's investigation into a second man who was on the scene with @entity23 his brother bore a striking resemblance to the police sketch that officials sent out after the bombing based on witness descriptions of the enigmatic suspect ' @entity73 no. 2 , ' who was the same height , build and complexion			1
the suspect was never identified			0
' i did not start out to solve the @entity9 bombing , i started out for justice for my brother 's murder , ' @entity18 said			1
' but along the way , every path i took , every lead i got , took me to the bombing			0
' the @entity19 says it ca n't find anything to suggest the videos exist , and says it would be ' unreasonably burdensome ' to do a search that would take a single staff person more than 18 months to conduct			2
@entity18 's belief that the tapes exists stems from a @entity93 document written shortly after the bombing that describes security video footage of the attack that shows suspects - in plural - exiting the truck three minutes before it went off			1
a @entity93 agent testified in 2004 that the log does , in fact , exist but that the government knows of no videotape			0
the log that the information was pulled from contained reports that were never verified , said @entity106 , then - assistant to the special agent in charge of the agency 's intelligence division			2
several investigators and prosecutors who worked the case told @entity1 in 2004 they had never seen video footage like that described in the @entity93 log			0
the @entity19 has released 30 video recordings to @entity18 from downtown @entity9 , but those recordings do n't show the explosion or @entity23 's arrival in a rental truck			1
if he wins at trial , @entity18 hopes to be able to search for the tapes himself rather than having to accept the @entity19 's answer that they do n't exist			1
@entity126 and @entity127 , who both lost grandchildren in the bombing , are grateful for @entity18 's pursuit of the case			1
@entity126 said she 's been waiting 19 years to see the tapes			2
the wreckage of the @entity134 building burned itself into the national psyche in 19956 but did @entity23 have company when he planted the bomb that did it ? was another man involved ? @entity140 ( left ) was sentenced to life in prison for helping @entity23 plot his terrorist act			1
@entity145 , the star witness in the @entity9 bombing trials , was released from federal prison in 2006 after serving a sentence for failing to inform authorities of what he knew about the bombing plot ' it is worth pursuing , ' @entity127 said			1
' i know there was somebody else			0
i have never stopped asking questions			0
' but former @entity52 rep. @entity158 , whose sister , dr. @entity159 , was killed in the bombing , said she is satisfied that officials have identified everyone responsible for the bombing			2
' i was very comfortable with the decisions that came out of the federal and state trials , ' @entity158 said			0
' i have reached that point in my life where i can continue			0
' @entity18 's mission began four months after the bombing when his brother died at the @entity40 @entity172 in @entity9			1
@entity18 , 44 , a convicted bank robber and construction worker , was brought there after being picked up for probation violations while coming back to the @entity40 at the @entity177 border , @entity18 said			2
his death was officially labeled a suicide			0
but his body had 41 wounds and bruises that his brother believes were the result of a beating			1
in 2008 , a federal judge awarded the family $ 1.1 million in damages for extreme emotional distress in the government 's handling of the death , but the amount was reduced to $ 900,000 after an appeal			2
@entity18 's best guess about the motive is that his brother died in an interrogation gone wrong by investigators demanding information @entity18 did n't have			1
@entity18 filed the @entity17 lawsuit in 2008			2
taking the feds to court : now @entity18 is on a mission to reveal the truth about his brother 's death and his suing the @entity19 to get answers going toe - to - toe with the federal government has come at a personal price for @entity18 , 67 , who says he 's lost time with his children and wife that he ca n't recover			1
but he has no regrets , fueled by his love for his brother			0
just three years apart , the two shared a bed , hunted coons together and played on the same sports teams growing up in a coal camp in @entity220			0
their paths diverged as adults - @entity18 becoming an attorney while @entity18 fell into drugs and crime - but the brotherly bond never broke			2
before his death , @entity18 had overcome his heroin addiction and had a newborn baby at home in @entity231 , @entity18 said			0
the brothers spoke by phone from jail the night before his death , with the two discussing how he would soon be out			0
' what i learned growing up in the coal fields is that you fight even when you know you ca n't win , ' he said			0
' because you have to make a stand on some things			0
justice for my brother is certainly one of them			0

@entity18 believes his brother @entity18 was arrested by the @entity19 after the 1995 bombing in the belief he was @entity23 's **accomplice**
@entity18 fit the description of the mysterious @entity73 no. 2 and his brother believes he was killed by *overzealous* interrogators
@entity18 was found dead in a federal holding cell after authorities say he hanged himself
@entity18 is suing the @entity19 to try to get them to reveal information he believes they *'ve* *withheld* from the public for nearly 20 years
the @entity19 now maintains @entity23 acted alone on the day of the bombing , but had an **accomplice** in @entity140 and *confidante* in @entity145
@entity145 was jailed for his role in the crime , which authorities say was failing to tell authorities what he knew
