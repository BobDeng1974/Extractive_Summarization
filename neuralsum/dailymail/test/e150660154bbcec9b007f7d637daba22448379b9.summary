@entity0 insisted on friday night that @entity2 football would benefit if referees gave a public explanation of their decisions after matches			2
the @entity8 manager stressed he still had a positive view of officiating in this country despite the @entity12 handball debacle that helped kill his treble dream last weekend			1
but @entity0 has called for similar transparency as in his @entity16 homeland , arguing that referees facing the media would help quell long - running furores and improve relationships			1
@entity8 manager @entity0 speaks to the officials after his side 's @entity22 semi-final loss to @entity24 @entity8 wrote to the @entity25 in the aftermath of last weekend 's defeat to @entity24 , seeking ' to understand ' how @entity28 and his assistants failed to act on the @entity12 incident			1
' when my team has a bad performance , i have to stand in front of newspapers and everybody , ' said @entity0			2
' if it 's good , it 's good			1
if it 's bad , it 's bad , but i have to stand up to it			1
' i ca n't understand what the problem is with the referees doing it as well			1
' they could say : ' i made a bad mistake , i 'm so sorry , i 'm irritated at myself , i should have done it better , i should learn from this			2
' what could you say after that ? ' it 's not important for me to speak with the referee			1
if the @entity56 has a question for me and i say no comment , it never stops			2
if i say what i think , then you move on			2
' it would be good for referees			2
we all know they will make mistakes in the future and do good and bad things			0
@entity24 defender @entity12 will be allowed to appear in @entity22 final after his ban was dismissed ' we will do the same , but just to be open and honest gets you much more respect			1
you have to be able to handle it through good times and bad times			0
' if they shut themselves away , you do n't get answers and that 's why we are writing a letter to them just asking what happened			1
' if not , we do n't need to do that			0
they tell it to television			0
what 's the problem ? more and more in @entity16 , the referees go to speak to the media after the match			1
' speaking in december , @entity0 said that @entity2 referees had been ' fantastic ' since he came to @entity8 and that he had encountered more problems in @entity94 matches			1
@entity12 was not sent off and no penalty was given as @entity24 went on to beat @entity8 3 - 2 after extra-time ' i have n't changed my mind , ' he insisted			1
' you see mistakes all over @entity94 and i think the referees here have been good , i have no problems with that			0
' it 's just afterwards there are a lot of things			1
so many meetings , appeals , i ca n't understand that system			1
but that 's not up to me , it 's up to others			2
' referees have performances evaluated by assessors but @entity0 feels it would be better if they came under a more public disciplinary system similar to managers and players			0
' i think it is strange that we have to do it and not the referees , ' he added			0
' we are all one unit â€“ football			0
' i think it should be the same rules for everybody			0
if my players are not performing well then i talk with them			0
and the solution might be that they are out of the team			0
' how do you punish a referee ? you could give another referee a chance instead , give someone a break			0
' in @entity16 referees get banned as well			0
they get told they have to go down to the first division for a couple of matches or have a week off and then come back again			0
i think that is made public			0
