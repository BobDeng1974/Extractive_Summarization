@entity1 star @entity0 and @entity2 appear in relaxed form ahead of sunday 's massive game at @entity5			1
@entity6 midfielder @entity2 posted a selfie of the duo on the team plane en route to @entity11 on saturday evening as @entity13 's side look to continue their unbeaten start to the @entity17 season			1
both players are set to play key roles against @entity21 's men with @entity2 tipped to play centre forward in the absence of injured strikers @entity25 and @entity26			1
@entity27 and @entity0 appear in relaxed form on the @entity1 team 's flight to @entity11 @entity31 star hazard scored a brace in @entity1 's midweek @entity34 rout of @entity35 and has been in excellent form for the @entity37			1
@entity13 takes his @entity1 side to @entity5 on sunday shunning the conservative approach to instead chase a victory over @entity41			1
@entity13 will play against one - time mentor @entity42 for the second time in competitive matches , bidding to build on the @entity37 ' seven wins in eight @entity17 matches so far this season			1
@entity0 scored twice for @entity1 in their 6 - 0 rout of @entity35 in the @entity34 on monday night last season , just three games into his second spell as @entity1 boss , @entity13 opted against fielding a recognised striker at @entity5			1
this time @entity1 travel with a win on their minds			2
' try ( for ) the best result as always , ' @entity13 said			2
@entity6 forward @entity55 could be deployed at centre forward against @entity41 at @entity5 ' try to play as good as we are playing and we are always trying to play , respecting an opponent that is one of the best and most difficult in the @entity17			1
' we are confident , we are in a good moment , in a good situation and there is no reason for us to change our feeling			0
' we play against a big team , yes , we know that , but we feel ourselves in a very good moment			0
' @entity25 is still unavailable for @entity1 as the @entity69 striker recovers from hamstring problems @entity13 is prepared to risk the fitness of striker @entity25 , who has scored nine goals in seven @entity17 games and is recovering from a hamstring problem and viral infection			1
@entity26 ( groin ) is out , while midfielders @entity77 ( foot ) and @entity80 ( groin ) could return alongside forward @entity2 ( illness )			0
@entity84 is to return in goal after @entity86 started tuesday night 's match against @entity35 and @entity88 is likely to play at left - back with @entity90 suspended			0
@entity91 , who was linked with @entity41 in recent seasons , has been key to @entity1 's form this term since signing from @entity95			2
but @entity13 is confident his side can adapt if @entity41 try to shut down the @entity69 playmaker , just as @entity98 tried last weekend			2
the @entity37 boss added : ' if he does n't run ( the game ) , somebody runs it			0
against @entity98 he had individual police and we played without him in the first half when he had that individual policing			0
' we are very confident about ourselves			0
i 'm not interested in thinking which team @entity41 play , who is playing , who is not playing			0
' we are playing well , we are confident , we are top of the league , we are in a good position			0
' the camp is happy and we are ready for the game			0

@entity1 are unbeaten in the @entity17 this season and are *targeting* their eighth victory at @entity5 on sunday
