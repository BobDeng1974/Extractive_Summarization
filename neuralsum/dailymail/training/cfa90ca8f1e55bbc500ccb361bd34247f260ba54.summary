by sir @entity0 published : 17:32 est , 14 march 2014 updated : 04:29 est , 15 march 2014 @entity2 have a simple decision to make on saturday : run out in @entity4 with the grand ambition of winning the championship , or tediously settle for winning the game and seeing what happens			1
the @entity9 is about three things : winning the @entity11 , winning the championship and - most importantly - @entity14 preparation			1
@entity2 are in the toughest @entity14 pool in history with @entity17 and @entity18 next year , and although @entity2 will back themselves at @entity20 , there is a real possibility that these three teams will beat one another and winning the pool - or even coming second - could boil down to points difference			1
go for it : @entity2 have a tough decision to make on saturday , settle for winning or try and hammer @entity27 creator : fly - half @entity29 trains in @entity4 ahead of the @entity9 finale young stars : @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 talk tactics at the @entity37 that means this is the perfect dress rehearsal for the scenario in which @entity2 need to dramatically boost their points difference			1
it could be the difference between facing @entity43 in the quarter - finals or @entity45 - or not making the knockout stages at all			1
as well as @entity18 and @entity17 at the @entity14 , @entity2 are likely to face @entity47 and a team such as @entity49			1
@entity2 should manage a cricket score against @entity49 , but @entity47 at full strength are every bit as good as @entity27 - and that is the fixture which @entity2 should have in the back of their minds today			1
this season , both @entity56 and @entity57 came second in their @entity60 groups on goal difference and consequently found themselves facing - and going out to - @entity62 and @entity63			2
there is no silver lining in losing on points difference and the @entity2 team should view coming second as failure			1
we ’re surely setting our sights too low if we are celebrating beating @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity18			2
you can not replicate the intensity of the @entity18 week in the build - up to facing @entity27 because there is no chance of defeat so you have to create that edge by demanding your players belt @entity27			1
big game ? @entity2 wo n't be able to replicate the intensity of the victory over @entity18 last week two lines of attack @entity2 now have the confidence and the personnel to attack with two running lines at once , which forces defenders to hesitate before committing to a tackle			2
@entity29 can read a defence and either pass a flat ball to a direct runner such as @entity34 ( option 1 ) or throw the ball deep behind to @entity96 ( option 2 ) , who can himself read the open field and choose to attack himself , pass inside or release @entity101 out wide			0
the flexibility and versatility of attacking like this makes @entity2 ’s dynamic back three even more dangerous			2
@entity101 has made the most metres ( 410 ) , most clean breaks ( 7 ) and beaten most defenders ( 20 )			0
@entity2 must get him the ball in space			2
new ball game attention to detail is key to being clinical and i ’m pleased that @entity2 ensured the adidas match ball was sent over from @entity27 for training			1
its panelling is different to the @entity118 ball that the players are used to handling , so it can feel different to the fingers and fly differently off the boot			0
with the need to rack up a huge score , it is very important @entity29 has been using it for kicking practice this week			0
all smiles : the @entity2 team pose with the @entity130 trophy after the game the new challenge , and the way to get the players pumped up , is to put the competition ’s minnows to the sword			2
this is not demanding the undoable - @entity2 score on average 39 points and 4.6 tries per game against @entity27 - but it is time to smash them again			1
last year @entity2 failed to score a try against @entity27 at @entity20 , while on our last three visits to @entity4 , @entity2 failed to win by more than five points			1
the mindset must be to score as many points as you possibly can because imagine the nervousness in the @entity154 dressing room if they know they suddenly have to beat @entity157 by more than 15 points			1
my ambition would be to score eight tries			2
i would make it clear to the team that unless @entity2 have scored four tries by half - time , i ’m taking you off and i am changing the back line			1
@entity168 , @entity96 and @entity34 would all come off and i would start the second half with @entity170 and @entity171 as my half - backs , and @entity29 shifting to inside centre alongside @entity35			0
what a fantastic back division to bring on and a totally different midfield axis			0
impact : i would bring on @entity170 ( left ) and @entity171 at half - time , depending on the score @entity179 sub : and @entity35 could change the game if he replaces @entity34 i would have called a team meeting on monday morning to set the agenda for the week			2
you warn the players that as soon as you feel the performance is slipping , you are bringing your substitutes on			0
in fact , i would even consider making the target three tries by the half - hour mark and warn my players that they will not even see out the first half unless they deliver			0
would i share this with the media ? why not			0
this is a week to play with people ’s minds and really put them under pressure and see how they respond			0
you generate intensity by raising expectation , not talking down @entity2 ’s chances			2
do not accept this is another game			0
you need possession to score points so a key requirement is to keep the ball in play as much as possible			2
the ambition must be never to kick the ball away			0
@entity72 had possession against @entity27 for 26min 45sec so i want to see @entity2 smash that record by 20 per cent ( @entity2 ’s best so far is 22min 56sec in their opening match in @entity216 ) rallying call : i would have called a team meeting , to let them know if standards slip , subs will come on big boot : @entity29 must try to keep the ball in play , and not allow stoppages second of all , you need to ensure the referee allows the game to be played to your tempo			1
you make sure captain @entity229 is in his ear all game , making sure he stops the clock immediately if someone is injured so no seconds are wasted			0
if you win a penalty , kick to the corner quickly and @entity237 should pre-call the line - out while the pack are running to take it			0
drop goals are worth taking if the ball is slow and the defence is set , but make the decision quickly and start again			0
saturday is the day to really show off @entity2 ’s new all - court game			1
@entity2 have developed a pack of forwards who love to handle the ball so they would relish this challenge			0
quality delivery at the breakdown is key , so players must commit in number to sort the mess out and give the backs slick , quick ball			0
game changers : it 's time for @entity2 's forwards to show off their new quick game , especially @entity237 crunch clash : can @entity229 lead this team to glory ? the @entity9 is here for the taking the key thing to stress is that you do not need to force the tries or score off every phase			1
if @entity2 are clinical in execution then the points will come			1
i would paste up on the wall of the changing room a poster of numbers - the lowest error count in a @entity9 match , the highest number of turnovers , the highest number of tries , and demand the team beat those figures			1
no team have ever managed three or fewer handling errors or turnovers in a match			0
if you commit no errors you keep the intensity of the game up and the ball in play for longer			0
this @entity9 is still there for the taking			1
i just hope @entity2 realise that .			0

second is failure for @entity2 , they should go all - out against @entity27
there is no silver lining in losing to @entity72 on points difference
my ambition would be to score eight tries , possibly using the bench
the @entity9 is here for the taking
