by @entity1 reporter last updated at 11:49 pm on 14th december 2011 it 's a startling number : one in four women surveyed by the government say they were violently attacked by their husbands or boyfriends			1
the study - released wednesday by the @entity8 - also says that one in five @entity10 women will be or have been raped in the course of their lifetime			1
the report showed that as many as 29million women said they 've been victim of serious rage , including being choked , beaten , shot , stabbed , or punched			0
shocking : a new study says that one in four women were violently abused by their partner - including beatings , choking , and slammed into things the survey also revealed if slapping , pushing , and shoving are included in the already horrific definition of abuse , that number rises as high as 36million women in the @entity10 though polling was anonymous , the claims of aggression are real , and are much higher than many agencies predicted			1
a government official who oversaw the research called the results ' astounding			0
' ' it 's the first time we 've had this kind of estimate ' on the prevalence of intimate partner violence , said @entity41 of the @entity8			1
experts in domestic violence do n't find it too surprising , although some aspects of the survey may have led to higher numbers than are sometimes reported			0
one expert called the new report 's estimate on rape and attempted rape ' extremely high ' — with one in five women saying they were victims			1
about half of those cases involved intimate partners			0
no documentation was sought to verify the women 's claims , which were made anonymously			2
but advocates say the new rape numbers are plausible			0
' it 's a major problem that often is under - estimated and over-looked , ' said @entity63 , director of health for @entity65 , a @entity66 - based organization that advocates against domestic abuse			0
the @entity8 report is based on a randomized telephone survey of about 9,000 women			1
several of the @entity8 numbers are higher than those of other sources			2
for example , the @entity8 study suggests that 1.3 million women have suffered rape , attempted rape or had sex forced on them in the previous year			1
that statistic is more than seven times greater than what was reported by a @entity84 household survey conducted last year			0
there may be several reasons for the differences , including how the surveys were done , who chose to participate and how ' rape ' and other types of assault were defined or interpreted , said @entity93 , a statistician with the @entity94			0
