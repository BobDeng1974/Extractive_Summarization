there is no shortage of impressive houses in @entity3 , the commuter - belt @entity4 town that ’s home to @entity7 hedge - fund types , high - flying lawyers and the odd footballer			1
but none is in the same league as @entity12 , a 500 - year - old @entity13 listed @entity15 mansion that has had more care and attention lavished upon it than a king ’s mistress			1
its ancient timber frame , oriel windows and ornate herringbone brickwork are easy to fall in love with , as businessman and racing driver @entity25 did back in the 1980s when a friend of his , the former golf champion @entity27 , pointed it out			1
@entity30 : @entity31 , a 500 - year - old @entity13 listed @entity15 mansion in @entity3 , @entity4 has been put on the market for £ 8.75million at that time @entity31 was n’t for sale , but @entity25 never forgot it			1
years later , he moved to @entity35 , but asked @entity27 to let him know if it ever came on the market			1
when it did , in 1994 , @entity25 put in a sealed - bid offer and won by a margin of just £ 4,000			1
the house needed renovating , and over the next 15 years , @entity25 gave it five - star treatment			1
he carried out major repairs to the roof , completely rewired and replumbed the property , increased the number of bedrooms from five to seven and added new bathrooms			0
he landscaped the three acres of grounds and built an elegant glazed summerhouse from which the @entity12 can be admired in all its @entity52 glory			1
‘ i have given this house everything i could , ’ says @entity25			1
‘ it ’s such a beautiful and special building that i wanted everything that went into it to be of the very best quality			0
i have spent an absolute fortune , but the house has deserved it			2
’ it is certainly an appropriate setting for the motor - racing trophies that fill the shelves			1
until 2010 , @entity25 was a leading name in the popular @entity65 , which pits high - performance versions of ordinary saloons – @entity68 , renaults , @entity70 – against each other at @entity72 , @entity73 and other well - known circuits			1
sprawling gardens : the immaculate gardens at @entity12 in green @entity4 comes complete with a pond unique charm : one of the impressive bedrooms at @entity12 , still keeping with the mansions @entity15 style for brighter days : in addition to the seven bedrooms , @entity12 also boasts a summer house @entity12 is in @entity85 , on the edge of @entity3			1
but it was n’t always in this spot			0
its origins are hidden in the name			0
for 400 years , the @entity12 was in the village of @entity93 in @entity94			1
in the 1920s , its owner , a member of a wealthy brewing family , had it taken down , transported west and reassembled			2
a tree - lined drive leads up to the metal security gates , through which you can see the house , with its nine chimneys , set in immaculate formal gardens with box hedging and lollipop - shaped @entity109 trees			0
a walk through the heavy oak door into the entrance hall with an enormous chandelier takes visitors to a 36ft drawing room on the right			0
driving force : @entity25 in his racing gear its oak - panelled walls and huge stone inglenook fireplace date from @entity122 , as do many of the small - pane leaded windows			1
some contain beautiful 16th century stained glass , with one showing the coat of arms of @entity127 , @entity128 ’s lord chancellor , who was born in @entity94			0
down the passage from the drawing room is the pink - walled dining room with a vast antique mirror reflecting its 12 - seater polished dining table			0
‘ we ’ve had some fantastic @entity135 here , ’ says @entity25			2
no less impressive is the 20ft square kitchen , installed by @entity25 himself			2
its vaulted , beamed ceiling is supported by enormously thick timber pillars either side of a marble - topped island , above which hangs another giant chandelier			0
@entity146 , is a sitting room , used as a den by @entity25 ’s nine - year - old daughter , and a large , well - equipped utility room			1
a door leads out on to a pergola - covered terrace complete with a large circular dining table and barbecue			0
a shiny black hot tub is even equipped with a dvd player and a tv screen that rises at the touch of a button			0
a second staircase leads up from this end of the house to two bedrooms and a bathroom , creating a self - contained wing for guests or staff			0
the main 16th century staircase takes visitors to the majestic master bedroom and a bathroom			0
two more bedrooms , one each for @entity25 ’s daughters , the eldest of whom is at university , and another bathroom complete this floor			2
@entity25 spent years collecting furniture and fittings for the house			1
unfortunately , he can no longer enjoy the fruits of his labours			0
he and his wife have separated , so @entity12 must be sold			2
it is on the market with @entity188 at £ 8.75 million			2
will @entity25 look for another project ? ‘ no , i could n’t do anything like this again , ’ he insists			2
‘ it was a fantastic experience , but it takes it out of you			0
the house i ’m planning to move to is a modern four - bedroom place – very nice but nothing like this			2
‘ i ’m proud that i ’ve helped preserve a piece of @entity201 history , though			0
’ @entity202 , 01582 465000			0
