@entity2 's former @entity1 lover has told her country to stop ' cyber-bullying ' him after he was branded a national curse for backing @entity6 in the @entity7			1
the @entity9 singer , 70 , was spotted in a vip box at the @entity12 stadium on tuesday night as the host nation was thrashed 7 - 1 by @entity14 in one of the worst defeats of the tournament 's history			1
his support came to the dismay of fans who had nicknamed @entity2 ' pe frio ' - the jinx - for lending his backing to a string of doomed sides earlier in the tournament			1
@entity6 fans had even made cardboard cut - outs of @entity2 supporting rival teams as a good luck charm after his branding as ' pe frio ' , which literally means ' cold feet '			1
but last night he was spotted cheering on @entity6 for the crucial match in @entity39 - wearing an @entity61 cap for good measure			2
he shared a vip box with @entity37 , his 15 - year - old son by the @entity1 model and celebrity @entity65 , who watched the humiliating defeat wearing a signed @entity6 team shirt			1
also in the box was @entity70 , the @entity71 agent for a number of @entity6 squad players			0
leave him alone ! @entity2 's former lover @entity65 took to @entity75 to defend him from ' cyber-bullying ' curse : the @entity7 has coincided with a @entity9 world tour ( pictured ) in which @entity2 has offered words of support to whichever country his band entertains - often with seemingly disastrous results slurs : one @entity1 news network , @entity84 , called the @entity9 frontman ' the biggest jinx in history ' @entity1 news network @entity84 ran a large photo of @entity2 in the vip box declaring he was ' invincible ! ' and ' the biggest jinx in history '			1
the mockery was so huge it pushed ms @entity65 , who had @entity2 's child in 1999 , to launch an impassioned defence of him on her @entity75 account			2
national figure of fun : @entity2 has made headlines ' @entity2 has been successful for 50 years , he 's a good friend and good father to my 15 - year - old son			1
' he is suffering cyber bullying ...			0
and i would like to ask you guys who do this kind of bullying to think before you do it			0
' even though it only seems like a small thing , @entity2 is a person like us all , and he does not deserve to be treated this way by @entity1			0
' she also posted videos of herself in a @entity6 shirt describing how sad she was in @entity114			0
the @entity7 has coincided with a @entity9 world tour in which @entity2 has offered words of support to whichever country his band entertains - often with seemingly disastrous results			2
@entity2 earned his nickname after he told fans during a show in @entity124 that @entity125 would beat @entity126 and advance to the knockout stages , but the @entity128 lost and were eliminated			0
he then told fans in @entity130 that @entity131 would win the @entity7 - and they too were eliminated			0
he reportedly joined @entity132 to cheer on the @entity133 , who lost to @entity135 in the second round			0
and after rooting for @entity61 against @entity126 , they too were humiliated by two @entity139 goals			0
it is not the first time @entity1 have described @entity2 as a curse for the national side			0
during the @entity145 in @entity146 , some parts of the @entity1 media claimed their team lost to the @entity148 in the quarter finals because @entity2 wore a @entity6 shirt to the game			2
he 's got history : @entity6 fans before the quarter - final match			1
@entity2 has been blamed for national defeats before anyone but us : fans used the same cardboard cut - out trick before @entity6 's quarter - final clash against @entity161			1

@entity9 star dubbed ' pe frio ' - the jinx - after backing several losers
@entity6 fans made *talisman* cardboard cut - outs of him supporting *opponents*
but to their dismay , 70 - year - old *rocker* *decided* to back host nation instead
he sat in vip box watching @entity14 trounce @entity6 7 - 1 in *semi-final* disaster
@entity2 has since become a figure of mockery in the shamed host nation
former lover @entity65 defended him against ' cyber-bullying '
