a female gray wolf from the @entity2 traveled hundreds of miles into northern @entity3 , marking the species ' first appearance in the region in more than 70 years and the farthest journey south , wildlife officials confirmed friday			1
a wolf - like animal had been spotted roaming the @entity10 of the @entity11 and the adjacent national forest since last month			1
biologists collected its scat and sent it to a @entity17 laboratory for testing , verifying what environmentalists had suspected based on its appearance and a radio collar around its neck			0
this photo from the @entity25 shows a gray wolf that was spotted north of the @entity11 in northern @entity3			1
wildlife officials have confirmed the presence of the first gray wolf in northern @entity3 in more than 70 years			1
' the corroboration is really good to get , ' said @entity31 of the @entity32			0
biologists do n't know the wolf 's age or from where it traveled			2
the radio collar was n't transmitting a signal , and cold weather forced biologists to suspended efforts to capture the animal and replace the collar			0
the @entity45 lab might be able to glean more details about the wolf from its dna , but @entity51 @entity50 spokesman @entity49 said that could take several weeks or months			1
' we 'll let this wolf be a wolf where it 's at , and if it decides it 's going to move back north , it can do that , ' he said			1
' or if somebody joins her , then that 's nature taking its course			0
' analysis of the animal 's scat shows it 's from a @entity2 population			2
the wolf is believed to have traveled at least 450 miles into northern @entity3 , where it 's been spotted at the @entity11 and the adjacent forest wolves often roam vast distances in search of food and mates			1
but the farther they go , the less likely they are to find a mate , said @entity75 , who led recovery efforts for wolves in the @entity2 over two decades before retiring from the @entity78 in 2011			2
' it 's looking for love , ' he said			0
' it leaves the core population and does n't know the love of its life is going to be right over the next hill , so it just keeps traveling			0
' about 25 percent of the roughly 1,700 wolves from the @entity2 are being tracked , wildlife officials said			1
they are distinguished from the @entity90 gray wolves found in the @entity91 by their more full bodies and less pointed ears			2
@entity94 with the @entity78 in @entity95 said @entity2 gray wolves are hard - wired to disperse and have traveled hundreds of miles			1
one young female started off in @entity99 and traveled 3,000 miles over six months , making stops in @entity95 , @entity45 , @entity101 and @entity102 before it died , he said			0
@entity102 had been the farthest journey south for the animals until the female was confirmed in @entity3 , he said			1
wolves from another major population in the western @entity109 have likewise been found far from home			0
wolves largely were exterminated early last century across the lower 48 states , except in the western @entity109 area			0
the @entity2 population was restored after 66 gray wolves from @entity116 were relocated to central @entity45 and @entity117 in @entity95 in the mid- 1990s			1
they 've been absent from the @entity11 region since the 1940s			2
the @entity78 in recent years lifted federal protections for the animals in the western @entity109 and the @entity2			1
a federal judge recently ordered the protections re-instated in @entity95 after wildlife advocates sued			0
environmentalists are pressing for continued protection of gray wolves			0
meanwhile , they celebrated the news of the one in northern @entity3			2
' i wonder if she has any sense of the celebrity she has achieved , ' said @entity136 of @entity137 .			0

a gray wolf was recently *photographed* on the north *rim* of the @entity11 in @entity3
any wolf roaming near the @entity11 would be protected under the @entity51 @entity143
it would presumably have *ventured* hundreds of miles south from the @entity2
the animals were *reintroduced* in the 1990s and are now estimated to number nearly 1,700
