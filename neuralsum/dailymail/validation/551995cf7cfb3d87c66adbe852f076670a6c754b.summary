high streets were given a helping hand yesterday as @entity2 announced a ‘ wide - ranging review ’ into crippling business rates high streets were given a helping hand yesterday as @entity2 announced a ‘ wide - ranging review ’ into crippling business rates			1
introduced in @entity9 times , the tax is accused of pushing independent shops out of business by charging punishingly high rates			1
high street retailers claim it places them at a disadvantage to online rivals because it is only charged on ‘ bricks and mortar ’			1
business rates are forecast to raise £ 22.4billion in @entity20 in 2014 - 15 , from 1.8million non-domestic properties			1
but the chancellor announced a review into the controversial levy , saying ‘ you can not create jobs without successful businesses ’			1
‘ in my opinion , the current system of business rates has not kept pace with the needs of a modern economy and changes to our town centres , ’ he said			1
‘ it needs far - reaching reform			2
’ business rates are currently calculated according to the rental value of the property a company uses			1
but this is based on prices from 2008 , the height of the property boom , which do not take into account the effect of the recession			0
the system also means some small shops on busy high streets pay very high rates , while online giants such as @entity55 , with large warehouses in cheaper locations , pay less			1
tax expert @entity58 , of @entity60 accountants , said the review launch was ‘ welcome but long overdue ’ , adding that ‘ any benefits of change are unlikely to filter through until well into the next @entity64 ’			1
‘ it will , therefore , be a watching brief for some time yet , which will offer little respite for mid-market retailers who continue to feel the pain of rates set in 2008			1
‘ we need a resurgence of help for independent shops so that we can compete fairly with the big boys , ’ she added			1
‘ it is so expensive to have bricks and mortar and , if we do n’t protect them … we will lose that service and face - to - face contact that you will never get online			1
’ @entity102 , of the @entity103 , said the smallest businesses should be removed from the rates			2
the review began on monday and retailers and organisations will be invited to give their opinions			1
but shops hoping for a large tax cut could be disappointed , as ministers have already warned any changes are likely to be ‘ fiscally neutral ’ , meaning the @entity114 would still generate the same amount of tax			2
@entity117 , of the @entity118 said it was ‘ crucial ’ that the review considers how the rates system can ‘ better support small business owners who are struggling ’			1
last year , mps on the @entity124 suggested the business rates system should be ‘ based on sales rather than the rateable value of a property ’			1
a raft of measures were unveiled to appeal to young workers			0
the national minimum wage will increase by 20p an hour to £ 6.70 from october			2
this represents the largest increase , when adjusted for inflation , in almost ten years			0
the hourly rate for apprentices will also go up by a record 57p to £ 3.30 an hour			0
this will result in an annual salary rise of over £ 1,000 for a full - time apprentice and benefit 67,000 young people			2
the government said this would ensure that ‘ those undertaking this important type of training are rewarded ’			0
employers ’ national insurance contributions will also be abolished for under - 21s from next month , and for young apprentices from april 2016			0
this will encourage more businesses to hire young workers			0
budget documents revealed that more than two million people have started apprenticeships under the current government			0
in the last year , the highest ever number of students from disadvantaged backgrounds also applied to , and were accepted into , university			0
@entity2 promised income - contingent loans of up to £ 25,000 for @entity163 students studying for phds and research - based master ’s degrees			2
sir @entity166 , chairman of the @entity167 , said : ‘ the plans should improve the chances of low and middle income graduates taking on research master ’s and doctoral courses which have become the preserve of better off students			0
’ @entity174 , of the @entity175 welcomed the boost for young workers			0
she said : ‘ over one million of the three million people who work in retail are under 24			0
‘ the abolition of national insurance contributions for under - 21s will allow retailers of all sizes to create new job opportunities			2
‘ the industry also employs almost 20 per cent of the @entity163 ’s apprentices and abolishing national insurance contributions will make it easier and more cost - effective to employ and train them			0
’ @entity190 , 34 , ( pictured above ) is a wedding dress designer who pays £ 28,000 in business rates per year			1
she welcomed the government ’s review of the rates , which she said should be lowered to keep small businesses thriving			2
the designer , of @entity199 , near @entity200 , started her business in 2003 and stocks 40 shops across @entity203			2
she has seen business rates rise steadily			1
the rates affect her own showroom , which occupies two floors of an office block , but also the shops on the high street which she relies upon to stock her dresses			1
‘ i would like to see lower business rates and less red tape , ’ she said			1
‘ we supply 350 stores … and they are the shops on the high street who could really stand to benefit from a reduction in rates			1
’ £ 143 - a - year tax break for 4.6million who work for themselves the self - employed were given a £ 143 - a - year tax break yesterday			1
the chancellor announced the government would axe a £ 2.75 - a - week national insurance contribution ( @entity228 ) ‘ in the next @entity64 ’ , for the 4.6million who work for themselves			1
but it emerged the tax break could be a sweetener before a huge shake - up of @entity228 , which funds benefits such as the state pension and maternity leave			2
the small print of the @entity74 revealed ministers were planning a ‘ contributory benefit test ’ – suggesting the self - employed may soon have to pay more for benefits such as the state pension			0
they usually pay two types of @entity228 – class 2 , a weekly charge if profits are more than £ 5,885 a year , and class 4 , an annual charge if profits are over £ 7,956			0
mr @entity2 made no mention of the new ‘ test ’ in his speech , saying only that he would be scrapping the unpopular class 2 @entity228			0
the self - employed will continue to pay class 4 , which is charged at either 2 or 9 per cent of profits depending on earnings			0
the class 2 tax , while not enormous , was seen as an administrative burden to pay weekly			0
@entity117 , of the @entity118 , said : ‘ the scrapping of class 2 @entity228 will provide welcome relief for the self - employed , at least in the short term			0
‘ what this means for their level of pension and welfare entitlement in the long - term , however , needs to be examined			0
’ the self - employed traditionally pay less national insurance because they receive less in benefits , including the second state pension , sick pay and holiday pay			0
but , from april 2015 , everyone will receive a flat - rate state pension irrelevant of contributions – which could put the self - employed at an unfair advantage			0
@entity277 , the government ’s older workers adviser , said yesterday : ‘ it is possible the government could off - set the tax break by asking [ the self - employed ] to contribute more towards the flat - rate state pension			2
