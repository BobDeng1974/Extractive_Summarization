out of @entity3 's @entity2 squad , out of contract at @entity5 in the summer ; but @entity0 will not be out of options			1
@entity0 has been the best left - back in the country for over a decade and , at times , arguably the best in world football			1
but what is the next move for the 33 - year - old ? where next ? @entity0 is resigned to leaving @entity5 this summer as his contract ends three @entity16 , two @entity17 , 107 @entity3 caps , three @entity20 titles , seven @entity21 , a @entity22 and @entity24 trophy , one @entity25 and three @entity26			1
wherever he goes , he 'll need a separate removal van just for the silverware			0
options in @entity3 appear more limited , but are not out of the question			0
with @entity33 set for a move to @entity35 , the only other viable clubs that could offer @entity0 the standard of football he would require to remain in this country are @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			1
city are n't short of left - backs , @entity42 has shown faith in young @entity48 full - back @entity46 , but @entity49 could do with a replacement for the injury - prone @entity51 and the inconsistent @entity52			1
would @entity0 really return to a club where fans dubbed him ' @entity0 ' when he moved to @entity5 for far bigger wages ? stranger transfers have happened in football			2
finished : @entity0 retired from international football having been left out of @entity3 's @entity2 squad happy days : @entity0 could be set for a return to @entity40 , who he left to join @entity5 @entity0 has had a renaissance at the end of this season , starting in big games against @entity41 and @entity67 , and @entity5 manager @entity68 did not rule out keeping @entity0 , along with veteran team - mates @entity69 and @entity71			1
‘ was the @entity73 game the last game for @entity0 , @entity69 and @entity71 ? i do n’t think so , ’ @entity68 said			0
@entity0 's reaction after that final game of the season at @entity78 when he burst into tears suggested otherwise			2
and , after his eight - year association with the club , he might fancy pastures new			0
when his representatives negotiated his latest deal last year , worth just under £ 200,000 - per - week but greatly dependant on bonuses which he is not getting sitting on the bench , they held tentative talks with @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity35			2
on the continent : real manager @entity92 may move for the left - back having always been an admirer @entity0 has considered the idea of moving abroad in the past			1
in his 2006 autobiography ' my defence ' he wrote : ' i ’d entertained @entity101 thoughts			0
ask any player with ambition ; they ’ll all do it from time to time			0
' nothing concrete , just tossing clubs around like a kid dreaming impossible dreams : @entity89 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112			0
' @entity89 manager @entity113 is fond of @entity0 and knows him well from his spell in charge of @entity5 from 2009 - 2011 when they won the league and @entity118 double in 2010			1
@entity113 has spoken in the past about his admiration for the left - back 's work ethic			1
uncertain future : @entity71 earned a new contract , but @entity0 and @entity69 are yet to receive an offer @entity112 are in the process of overhauling their squad after a terrible @entity130 campaign , although @entity0 said in the same autobiography that he was not keen on a move to @entity133			2
the @entity134 is becoming an increasingly attractive prospect to former stars heading into the twilight of their careers since the likes of @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 crossed the @entity145			0
the @entity146 and @entity147 are both understood to be interested and @entity68 hinted earlier in the season that @entity141 , a former team - mate of @entity0 at @entity40 , was trying to persuade him to make the move to @entity150			2
' maybe @entity141 is doing with the @entity146 the same as @entity140 [ @entity140 ] did with @entity152 , ' @entity68 said			0
' [ @entity0 ] has [ a future at @entity5 ] , but maybe @entity141 has a better proposal			0

@entity0 's contract is up at @entity5 , but he still has options
@entity41 , @entity39 , @entity35 , @entity89 and even former side @entity40 could move for the left - back this summer
@entity0 was left out of @entity162 's *23* - man @entity3 @entity2 squad
left - back has *previously* stated how he would like to play in @entity165
