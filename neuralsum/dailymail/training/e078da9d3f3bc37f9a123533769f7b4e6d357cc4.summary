@entity6 & @entity7 , run by young mothers @entity9 and @entity10 , have been asked to supply three pairs of earrings and a necklace			1
they were recommended by @entity15 ’s sister , @entity16 based fashion designer @entity14 , who has previously dressed the @entity3			1
apparently @entity19 ‘ liked what they saw ’			0
they were very specific in their choices , ’ @entity28 - based miss @entity10 said			1
in the end @entity3 chose two pairs of earring from the ‘ @entity37 ’ – one in citrine featuring a bow costing £ 360 and another in blue topaz			0
the stylish royal also chose a pair of pearl and diamond white gold earrings costing £ 1,500 and a matching pearl necklace costing £ 770			2
