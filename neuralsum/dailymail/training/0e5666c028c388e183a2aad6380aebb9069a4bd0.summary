the boys , aged three months and five months , had to be put on life - support machines suffering from infant botulism			1
both had been feeding badly and showed typical symptoms – a floppy head , drooping eyelids and constipation			0
they were cured only after medication costing £ 50,000 a dose was flown in from @entity5			1
the incidents , confirmed last week , have prompted public health chiefs to warn that infants under one should not be given honey			1

the identities of the babies treated and the hospitals involved have not been disclosed			2
but according to the latest health protection report from @entity33 , the five - month - old was diagnosed just before @entity34 in central or southern @entity35			1

the three - month - old was treated at a children ’s hospital in northern @entity35 and has recovered			0
his mother admitted giving him honey at home , though tests on what was left in the jar also failed to detect the botulism bacteria			1
products containing honey should carry warnings on the label but these often appear in small print and the dangers of the food are not widely known			0
warning : the incident sparked health experts to warn children under one year old should not be fed honey			1
botulism is caused by bacteria in soil , possibly spread by bees ( file picture ) the disease is caused by the bacteria clostridium botulinum , which lives in the environment , especially soil			1
if bees pick it up they can infect honey			1
dr @entity78 , a disease surveillance expert for @entity33 , told @entity80 : ‘ i am concerned that not enough mothers and women know about infant botulism and what can cause it			2
children under 12 months should not be fed honey			2

’ the disease is rare , with only 17 @entity2 cases since 1978			1
but health chiefs are concerned that nine have occurred in the past five years and of these seven babies had eaten honey			1
in one of the nine cases a baby was infected from dust falling during a loft conversion while another caught botulism from pet terrapins kept at home			0
dr @entity140 said : ‘ mothers think honey is natural and good for babies			2
there is also a tradition for honey to be used on a dummy to soothe a troubled baby or to sweeten other foods , but we are urging people not to do it			0
’ she advised that any baby who is constipated for three days should be taken to see a gp and for parents to watch out for other symptoms such as difficulty in swallowing			0
