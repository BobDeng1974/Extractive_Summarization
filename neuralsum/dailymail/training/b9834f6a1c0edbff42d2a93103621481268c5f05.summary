a multi-billion - dollar high - speed train network linking @entity1 with @entity2 moved a step closer as officials from both sides of the border thrashed out details			1
the proposed 300 mile route would link @entity9 , @entity10 , to @entity11 , @entity2 - slashing the current journey time from five hours by car to under two hours			1
advocates say the project , which would be the first high - speed train line in @entity1 and is set to be completed by 2018 , will provide huge economic boost to regions in both nations			1
@entity19 : a new high - speed train link would cut the 300 mile journey time between @entity9 , @entity2 , and @entity11 , @entity2 , to under two hours @entity10 democrat @entity22 and @entity24 commissioner @entity23 , as well as @entity2 officials , presented the plan to @entity27 secretary of transportation @entity28 on thursday in @entity30 mr @entity22 told @entity31 : ' @entity32 and his team are interested			1
a high - speed rail between @entity9 and @entity11 through @entity35 would revolutionize trade and travel between the @entity27 and @entity2			1
' @entity11 is @entity2 ’s third - largest city and is considered a financial and business captial of the region			2
according to @entity42 , the state ’s deputy minister for foreign investment , 80 percent of @entity27 @entity2 economic activity passes through @entity11 , @entity31 reported			2
but it has also been mired in violent clashes between two of @entity2 's most feared drug gangs			2
getting up to speed : the ambitious project to create a high - speed rail network linking @entity1 with @entity2 would embrace technology widely used in other parts of the world , such as @entity53 , pictured , playing catch up : @entity1 is someway behind @entity55 which has already built hundreds of miles of high - speed rail network on which bullet trains can reach 250kph authorities behind the plans have tried to allay fears that the train connection could be exploited by the violent drug gangs which control many parts of @entity2			1
officials insist the train will be non-stopping between @entity1 and @entity2			2
passengers would be able to go through strict immigration controls before the train departed , cutting the time spent at road border crossings dealing with paperwork			2
construction set to begin first half of 2015 and completed within four years , under the ambitious proposals outlined the @entity76			1
@entity2 estimates its share of the cost for the project will be around $ 1.5billion			1
lowering costs : the rising price of petrol has put pressure on authorities to find a cheaper means of mass transport , such as high - speed rail , similar to that used in @entity53 , pictured but the final go - ahead is dependent on a @entity27 study into the feasibility of a regional high - speed network linking @entity93 and @entity10 to southern neighbors			1
@entity1 is currently flirting with the idea of constructing a nation - wide high - speed rail network , joining major cities on both the west and east coast			1
the @entity27 finds itself playing catch up to other nations around the world which have far more established high - speed networks			1
@entity53 has had bullet trains running well over 150mph since the 1950s			0
it is currently fine - tuning a maglev system where trains can reach speeds of 350mph			0
@entity55 has the world 's longest high - speed rail network with more than 6,200miles of routes in service			1
now pressure is mounting on @entity1 to introduce a similar , low cost passenger transport network			0
according to a 2005 study by the @entity119 , traffic congestion is costing @entity27 $ 63.1 billion a year			0
those in favour of more rail travel claim an expansion of train routes will help the nation save billions			0
surging oil costs has caused car - loving @entity1 to look to the train for a cheaper means of getting around the country			0
high - speed rail projects linking mayor cities on both coasts have now been pushed to the top of the political agenda			1
multi-million - dollar feasablility studies have been launched across the country in a bid to get a network build within the next decade			0
a route from @entity140 to @entity141 via the @entity143 system is being contemplated			0
the @entity144 was created in 1996 by the state to implement an extensive 800 - mile rail system that is estimated to cost about $ 40 billion			2
once built , the system will not require operating subsidies , and it is expected to generate $ 1 billion in annual profits			0
the system would provide high - speed service between and among major cities , like @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , and @entity154 , and would allow travel between @entity153 ' @entity156 and @entity152 's @entity157 in two and a half hours			1
plans have been drawn up for 125 to 150mph electric trains running between @entity161 and @entity162 , @entity163			0
in september 2010 @entity164 unveiled proposals for 355 km / h trains to run between @entity30 and @entity167 , stopping at various cities along the way including @entity170 , @entity141 and @entity171			0
the end to end journey time would be three hours			2
the proposals would cost $ 117bn and would take 25 years to complete			0
@entity164 estimates that the capacity would be needed , as even after current investment programmes , the @entity177 trains will be full by 2030			0
the proposal envisages completion by 2040			0

@entity184 would link @entity9 , @entity10 , to @entity11 , @entity2
300 mile trip could be completed in under two hours
high - speed link would slash journey time from five hours by car
@entity2 estimates its share of the cost for the project will be around $ 1.5bn
construction set to begin first half of 2015 and completed by 2018
project would provide huge economic boost to regions north and south of the border
