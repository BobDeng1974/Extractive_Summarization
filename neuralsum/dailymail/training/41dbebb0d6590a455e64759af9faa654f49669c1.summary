when he was coming through the ranks at @entity2 , staff at their @entity5 training base talked in hushed tones about having found the next @entity7			1
with electrifying feet , surging pace and an eye for the outrageous , @entity8 had it all			1
these were staff who had seen them all			2
@entity16 , @entity7 , @entity17 and the like - but still the @entity15 - born starlet raised eyebrows			2
@entity8 looks set to leave @entity19 after failing to break into @entity21 's first - team plans the 21 - year - old has been loaned out to @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 during his time at the @entity19 @entity27 said he was considering bringing @entity8 back to @entity23 as he was ' his last chance ' age : 21 born : @entity15 , @entity30 position : midfielder clubs : @entity2 ( 2010 - 12 ) , @entity19 ( 2012 - ) , @entity24 ( loan , 2012 - 13 ) , @entity23 ( loan , 2014 ) , @entity25 ( loan , 2014 ) career appearances : 81 career goals : 14 from early on his behaviour away from the pitch , however , was rumoured to be as colourful as his performances on it			1
throughout secondary school , teachers at @entity47 's @entity46 , a 10 - minute drive from @entity49 where @entity50 also studied , had already grown exasperated with him			2
concerns were raised that the gifted teenager was hanging with the wrong crowd , older boys who were no strangers to @entity57			2
those fears were confirmed when , at 16 ( and after sir @entity60 had described him as ' the best talent i 've ever seen ' ) , he was in a car stopped in a drugs and guns bust in nearby @entity66			1
by that time he had also picked up a caution for assaulting his mother			2
still , stirred by his ability , @entity2 tried to make it work			1
coaches spent hours trying to put him on the straight and narrow – at one point there were even suggestions he had moved in with a senior first - team player			2
@entity8 was part of the @entity2 side which won the @entity80 in 2011 they thought his talent made it worth it			1
but with every tricky sidestep forward came two back			0
in may 2011 , shortly after @entity8 scored twice in an electrifying performance as @entity2 's youngsters won the @entity80 , he was fined £ 600 for throwing a girlfriend 's phone out of a window during an argument			1
that episode came after he narrowly avoided jail for witness intimidation and , amid rumours his agent had asked for a bumper new contract , sir @entity60 had finally reached the end of his tether			1
the @entity103 , however , would also not give up on him			0
with some sympathy for a less than ideal upbringing he thought that if he could get @entity8 away from @entity30 he might have a chance			1
a call was made to old friend @entity21			0
' @entity60 told me about his talent and that was it , ' @entity21 explained after paying £ 650,000			1
' that ’s enough for me			0
he said : " if you can sort this lad out , @entity21 , you ’ll have one of the best players you ’ve ever had "			0
i do n’t need anything more than that do i ? ' @entity21 , who immediately admired @entity8 's raw talent , believed he needed regular first - team football and sent him to @entity120 outfit @entity24			1
but problems followed him back up the @entity122			0
shocked at his attitude to training , manager @entity123 considered cutting the loan spell short but decided not to and was rewarded with a string of stunning displays			0
@entity8 , pictured arriving at @entity129 last year , has been in bother away from the pitch @entity131 had to intervene when team - mates @entity8 and @entity133 were involved in a bust - up enthused by his revival in the @entity136 , @entity21 believed the troubled youngster was at last maturing			1
when he waltzed through the @entity140 defence to seal a 3 - 0 win at @entity142 the world sat up and noticed			0
@entity21 called it ' genius '			0
not long after , @entity145 spoke of his admiration			0
there was even talk of a seat on the plane to @entity151 , further fuelled when a clip of that goal in an @entity155 training session went viral			0
@entity156 , whose then manager @entity157 knew him from his @entity2 days , offered £ 4m and were told in no uncertain terms where to go			1
form dipped , and with a relegation battle on his hands @entity21 sent @entity8 across @entity163 and down a division to promotion - chasing @entity23			1
@entity23 went up , but it spoke volumes that in the play - off final @entity27 left him on the bench			0
the @entity168 scored a terrific solo goal in @entity19 's 3 - 0 win against @entity140 in october 2013 that summer , as footballers partied in bars , @entity8 was behind them at @entity173 after being charged with two counts of common assault on an ex-girlfriend and her mother			1
bailed and back at @entity19 , @entity21 was not happy			1
' it 's not that he has to impress me as a footballer , we know about his talent , ' he said			0
his success , he added , was a question of him leading a ' disciplined life '			0
@entity25 was the next loan stop			0
in november , @entity8 was cleared of any wrongdoing for an alleged harassment of his ex over four years but will face trial for the alleged summer assaults in january			2
in @entity195 , after seven appearances with no goals , @entity192 joined the list of frustrated managers			0
for @entity21 , now eyeing @entity198 , enough was enough			0
it has now got to the stage where the @entity19 are willing to cut their losses and let a 21 - year - old , who has an £ 18m release clause in his contract , go for free			1
@entity8 is congratulated by his @entity19 team - mates after scoring at @entity142 he is currently in dispute with the club over wages after a fine for misconduct and any chance of a reconciliation appears to have passed			1
‘ it ’s very difficult to sit and watch such a great talent wasted , ' said @entity21			0
' in @entity8 ’s position , the talent is there , he just has to change his whole life and then hopefully somewhere down the line he ’ll become the player he should be			2
' as revealed by @entity222 , talks have opened with @entity223			2
a move to @entity225 would have to wait until the summer though as @entity8 has played in two countries - @entity168 and @entity227 - this season and @entity229 do n't allow a third			2
a renaissance in @entity231 ? not many in @entity30 , @entity163 , @entity24 or @entity25 would bet on it .			0

@entity223 are keen on signing @entity19 midfielder @entity8
@entity8 has been told he can leave the @entity19 for free this month
sir @entity60 lost *patience* with the @entity2 *academy* *graduate*
