by @entity0 for @entity1 somewhere in the desert of eastern @entity5 , a militant from the @entity3 beheaded the @entity7 journalist @entity6 this week			1
the killer and his terrorist group are responsible for @entity6 ’s death			2
they should be the focus of public anger			2
but @entity6 ’s execution is also a chilling wake - up call for @entity7 and @entity17 policymakers , as well as @entity7 news outlets and aid organizations			1
it is the clearest evidence yet of how vastly different responses to kidnappings by @entity7 and @entity17 governments save @entity17 hostages but can doom the @entity7			1
hostages and their families realize this fully — even if the public does not			2
free : @entity29 , ( center ) and @entity31 ( right , on the day they were released with @entity33 ) in may freedom : @entity36 correspondent @entity35 ( r ) and freelance photographer @entity37 arrive at the military airbase in @entity39 , near @entity40 following their release ' i wish i could have the hope of freedom and seeing my family once again , but that ship has sailed , ' @entity6 said moments before he was killed in a craven video released by the militant group on tuesday			2
' i guess , all in all , i wish i was n’t @entity7			1
' @entity6 clearly spoke under duress			2
but his regret at being an @entity7 captive , real or not , reflected grim fact			1
this spring , four @entity55 and two @entity57 journalists held hostage by the @entity3 extremists were freed — after the @entity55 and @entity57 governments paid ransoms through intermediaries			2
controversial theory : @entity1 ' @entity0 describes his kidnapping and hostage period in @entity66 in @entity67 last year the @entity7 government refused to negotiate or pay a ransom in @entity6 ’s case or for any other @entity7 captives — including my own abduction by the @entity74 five years ago			1
] with the help of an @entity78 journalist abducted with me , i was lucky enough to escape			1
but today @entity6 is dead and the @entity3 militants now say @entity80 , a journalist for @entity81 whom the group also captured , will be killed if the @entity7 does not stop bombing its fighters in @entity85			1
there are no easy answers in kidnapping cases			2
the @entity7 can not allow terrorist groups to control its foreign policy			1
one clear lesson that has emerged in recent years , however , is that security threats are more effectively countered by united @entity7 and @entity17 action			1
the divergent @entity7 and @entity17 approach to abductions fails to deter captors or consistently safeguard victims			1
last month , a @entity99 investigation found that @entity100 and its direct affiliates had received at least $ 125 million in revenue from kidnappings since 2008 — primarily from @entity17 governments			1
in the last year alone , they received $ 66 million			2
' kidnapping hostages is an easy spoil , ' @entity106 , the leader of @entity107 , wrote in a 2012 letter to the leader of an @entity100 affiliate in @entity113 , ' which i may describe as a profitable trade and a precious treasure			2
' flow of terror funds : @entity119 , @entity55 , @entity120 and @entity57 are accused of paying ransoms to terrorist groups along with @entity123 and @entity124 authorized mission : @entity126 delivered a statement from @entity128 , @entity129 , during his vacation on wednesday			2
hours later it was revealed he authorized a mission in july to save @entity6			0
it failed frightening : @entity134 tenses as his executioner addresses the camera who says this act of revenge is in responce to @entity7 airstrikes on @entity85 publicly , @entity17 governments deny making these payments			1
but former diplomats told the @entity99 that ransoms have been paid through intermediaries			0
kidnapping as a fundraising tactic is thriving and rates are going up			0
in 2003 , a ransom of roughly $ 200,000 was paid for each captive , the newspaper found			0
today , captors reap millions per captive			0
abductions have become so lucrative that @entity100 leaders in @entity66 help oversee negotiations for affiliates			0
militants groups spread across @entity113 , the @entity159 and @entity160 are now following the same rough protocol			0
watch video here dignified : @entity163 and @entity164 talked to reporters after the death of their son , photojournalist @entity6 , at the hands of @entity169 hostage - taking by extremist groups is now so pervasive that at least one major aid organization is not sending @entity7 aid workers to areas where they might be abducted			1
instead , they are sending citizens from @entity17 countries with governments that will pay ransoms			1
the cases have taken on a grim pattern : hostages are abducted , months pass with no news from the captors and a threatening video or email is then sent to families			0
in some cases , the militants ask that cases not be made public so ransom can be paid quietly			0
france $ 58.1m @entity123 and oman $ 20.4m switzerland $ 12.4m @entity57 $ 11m austria $ 3.2m this was the case in @entity6 ’s tortuous , 21 - month abduction			0
for the first 16 months after @entity6 was taken captive , his family had no information regarding his whereabouts			0
they learned he was alive from two @entity57 journalists who were freed by the @entity3 in march after a ransom was paid			0
in a subsequent email message , the captors instructed the family to keep the case quiet and not identify the @entity3 as the kidnappers			0
fearing for @entity6 ’s life , the family obeyed			0
other @entity7 families with loved ones taken captive by militants have done the same			1
privately , the @entity210 and other families have grown intensely frustrated with the failure of @entity7 officials to negotiate with the captors			1
@entity215 : it has emerged that @entity169 demanded a staggering $ 132m ransom for the return of @entity6			0
@entity221 , the ceo and co-founder of @entity223 , the @entity225 - based website that @entity6 was reporting for when he was captured told @entity220 it was considerably higher than for @entity17 captives ' purely because he was an @entity7 @entity7 government officials also refused to coordinate their response in any way with @entity17 governments			1
in the days and weeks ahead , the @entity6 family will speak for themselves about their ordeal			0
but the payment of ransoms and abduction of foreigners must emerge from the shadows			0
it must be publicly debated			0
@entity7 and @entity17 policymakers should be forced to answer for their actions			1
@entity6 believed that his government would help him , according to his family			0
in a message that was not made public , @entity6 said that he believed so strongly that @entity67 would help that he refused to allow his fellow @entity7 captives to not believe in their government			2
a consistent response to kidnapping by the @entity7 and @entity17 is desperately needed			1
the current haphazard approach is failing			0
@entity6 must not die in vain .			0

@entity7 journalist @entity0 believes @entity7 *'s* policy of not negotiating with terrorists needs to *change*
@entity0 was kidnapped in 2008 in @entity78 and escaped in 2009
believes that @entity7 needs to match @entity17 and begin paying terrorists
