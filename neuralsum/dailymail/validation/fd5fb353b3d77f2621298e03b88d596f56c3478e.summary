a nine - year - old boy found a message in a bottle while exploring a wooded beach of a small lake island on a family vacation - and then realized it was addressed to his grandfather			1
@entity7 had been on a fishing trip with his family on @entity10 in @entity11			1
his mother , @entity12 noticed her childrens ' attention waning and stopped at a small island to explore			0
that 's when @entity7 came across a screw - top dr @entity18 bottle with a rolled - up letter inside sitting next to a log			1
the letter was written to @entity7 's grandfather , @entity31 ( right ) @entity7 imagined it was a ' note from the pirates or something ' , and showed his parents who read the note first , according to the @entity37			1
@entity39 and her husband could only make out a few words on the yellowed paper towel , but were able to make out , ' i wish i could see you ... i love you so much ... i love you , @entity28 '			2
they could n't read who the letter was addressed to , but noticed the name started with the letter 'm '			0
@entity39 recognized the signature from an old friend of hers and immediately sent a picture of the letter to her friend @entity28 , who responded by saying she knew ' exactly where that came from '			1
in 1970 , when @entity57 , who 's now 58 , was about 13 years old , she was on an overnight church gathering on @entity10			1
the letter , found in the bottle pictured , had faded , but @entity39 could read , ' i wish i could see you ... i love you so much ... i love you , @entity28 @entity57 ( left ) hoped that @entity7 , righty , would find the letter when he was on vacation with his family later in the summer of 1970			1
he did n't discover the letter for another 45 years she was missing her then - boyfriend , @entity31 , who was n't allowed on the trip because he had gotten in some kind of trouble at the time			1
the couple had dated on and off when they were teenagers			0
' he had long hair			0
and my dad did not like him , so therefore , i liked him , ' @entity57 told the @entity37			2
' i was his church girlfriend			0
i knew he had other girlfriends			0
' she said that as a 13 - year - old , she was ' devastated ' that @entity7 could n't come on the trip			2
so she wrote a love note - as the couple often did - and stuffed it in a bottle before tossing it in a lake , hoping @entity31 would find it later in the summer when he vacationed with his family , according to @entity89			2
' with my whole heart , i just knew one day he would find it , ' @entity57 said			0
' i 've thought about it through the years , thinking , " i wonder if anyone ever found that bottle ? " ' @entity57 and @entity7 remain friends to this day , though they are no longer romantically involved			1
they both married different people and 45 years later , @entity7 did find it			1
@entity7 led him , now 58 , to the spot where he found the bottle , and his grandfather joked that he finally ' got it '			2
he had a good laugh and told @entity89 that it was fun to reminisce about the ' good old times '			0
' the more you think about it , the more it blows your mind , ' @entity7 told the @entity37			0
' there 's got to be some more meaning to this			0
' @entity57 agreed , saying she did n't know what ' the hidden message ' was			0
though the pair remained friends over the years , they decided they ' would have killed each other a long time ago ' , @entity57 said			1
she and her husband @entity119 have been married for nearly 40 years			0
@entity119 was on the same church trip as @entity57 the day she wrote her love letter to @entity7			1
@entity7 is also married with children and grandchildren .			2

@entity7 found the letter while fishing with his family on @entity10 in @entity11
