by @entity0 last updated at 10:28 am on 6th december 2011 @entity2 mp @entity1 was last night attacked for using a reference to @entity4 to criticise popular newspapers			1
the environmentalist made the provocative remark – described by one fellow mp as ‘ pathetically stupid ’ – at a star - studded session of a parliamentary committee investigating privacy and injunctions			1
sitting alongside actors @entity13 and @entity15 , the mp rejected arguments that newspapers should be given free rein to print stories about the private lives of famous people simply so that they sell more copies and remain financially viable			1
@entity1 made the provocative remark - described by one fellow mp as ' pathetically stupid ' - at a star - studded session of a parliamentary committee investigating privacy and injunctions			1
he later conceded his words could have been chosen differently ' silly ' : mr @entity1 later said that no - one could genuinely believe he equated tabloids to concentration camps ( from the left ) @entity15 , @entity13 and @entity30 giving evidence to the @entity33 on @entity34 and @entity35 at @entity36 , @entity37 he said : ‘ no one said that @entity4 should have been kept open because it created jobs			1
’ some 1.1million people – most of them @entity41 – died in the concentration camp in southern @entity43 during @entity45 ’s reign of terror in the early 1940s			1
mr @entity1 later insisted on @entity46 that his point about newspaper sales was ‘ valid ’ but conceded he ‘ could / should have made it citing something different ’			1
journalists hired private inquiry agents to amass ‘ a veritable treasure trove of information ’ about celebrities including @entity13 and his ex-girlfriend @entity56 , the @entity58 inquiry into press standards heard yesterday			1
in 2003 , investigators raided the office of a private agent used by national newspapers and found files detailing illegal searches for criminal records and car number plates , and other searches for addresses and ex-directory and mobile phone numbers			1
other ‘ targets ’ were not publicly named , but the inquiry was told one newspaper had paid £ 800 for the june 2001 phone bill of an unnamed sportsman from a national team			1
@entity58 said : ‘ in relation to some of [ the cases ] it ’s absolutely right that there may well be a public interest justification for the inquiry			1
in relation to others , however , it ’s difficult if not impossible to see what public interest justification there could be			1
’ he was appearing before the joint commons and @entity91 – separate to the ongoing @entity58 inquiry into press standards – because he had previously obtained a so - called super-injunction preventing the publication of private emails which had been leaked to the @entity97			1
he said newspapers that engage in immoral behaviour to boost sales should be allowed to go to the wall			1
but @entity103 mp @entity102 , a member of the @entity104 , expressed outrage at his use of @entity4 in his argument			1
‘ i just think it is a pathetically stupid comparison , ’ she said			1
‘ he should think before he opens his mouth and hurls insults like that			2
it will cause a lot of distress to people			2
’ last night a spokesman from the @entity118 said : ‘ @entity1 has said that he could or should have cited a different example and we agree			2
’ mr @entity1 added on @entity46 last night : ‘ no one can genuinely believe i equated tabloids to concentration camps			2
’ he had earlier told the committee that @entity125 found guilty of certain types of hypocrisy should be ‘ barred from office ’ , saying : ‘ if you are in a position of authority such as an mp ... it does mean you have to expect to be scrutinised very , very closely and very regularly to ensure you are not engaging in hypocrisy , you are not engaging in fraud , you are not abusing your position of power			2
revelations : mr @entity13 ( left ) told mps of his battles with photographers while mr @entity15 said he had spent thousands trying to protect his privacy former motor - sports boss mr @entity30 also gave evidence to the committee ‘ if an mp for example were to campaign on a ticket where he was incredibly homophobic and then it emerged later that that person was in fact gay then i think newspapers would have absolute right to rip that person to pieces – that would n’t be enough			1
i think they should be barred from office			2
’ the committee also heard from mr @entity13 who told how on one occasion photographers slashed every surface of his car with a knife			1
and mr @entity15 said that he had spent thousands of pounds in legal fees trying to defend his privacy			1
he said : ‘ i at one point threatened an injunction against a newspaper that was going to publish a story about a member of my family , not about me , that was no way in the public interest			2
' the correspondence that led to them not publishing cost me between £ 15,000 and £ 20,000			2
‘ in my pursuit of having had my phone hacked , that has cost me over £ 200,000 so far			2
i hope i will get it back one day – i do n’t know – so it keeps me awake			2
’ @entity30 , former boss of the @entity178 motor sports governing body , was also on the panel			2
he won damages for breach of privacy in 2008 after the @entity183 exposed his participation in a sado - masochistic orgy with prostitutes			2
@entity187 sees four crusaders take on the press four rich swordsmen yesterday visited @entity191 to complain about the naked nerve of the media			2
all were cross that their sexual / marital misadventures had been paddled in and peddled by the jaunty @entity97			2
such was their displeasure that they demanded a privacy law			0
their testimony was heard at times with giggling rapture by the new privacy and @entity205			0
the @entity207 ’s line ‘ thou shalt not commit adultery ’ may soon have to be tippexed out and replaced by ‘ thou shalt not publish any article about adultery , unless first having checked with the participants that they are happy to have their horizontal activities discussed by the @entity216 ’			0
our stern quartet of trouser - droppers was : @entity15 , comedian ; @entity13 , film actor ; @entity30 , sometime motor - racing johnny ; @entity1 , mp for @entity222 in the @entity224 interest			1
@entity15 described stories about celebrities ' sex lives as ' tawdry dirt ' at the hearing mr @entity30 is the one who had a run - in with the @entity231 after that newspaper disclosed his taste for sex parties , at one of which the laydees spoke @entity238 and wore prison uniforms			1
mr @entity30 , who wears a hearing aid and sounds ducal posh , is of the view that those who disapprove of his carry - on are dated moralisers			0
‘ this was actually a private orgy , ’ he said , most indignant			0
how reassuring , in this day and age , to find a chap so insistent on manners			0
if mr @entity30 is of the view that gate - crashing has run amok in 21st - century @entity253 , i ’m with the fella all the way , if that is the phrase			0
i wonder : did the invitations ( not stiffies , please ) to his private orgy say ‘ rsvp ’ and advise a time for carriages ? dress : optional			0
that sort of thing ? good for him ! @entity266 herself would admire such insistence on etiquette			0
but a curse on my frivolity			0
does it not prove what our four crusaders , our four doughty warriors for the common folk , were saying ? they envisaged an @entity278 ideal of journalism in which seemingly every page is an in - depth expose of malpractice in hospitals and the social services			0
one of them ( i forget which ) complained that the very word ‘ celebrity ’ was ‘ a pejorative term employed by @entity289 ’			0
plainly they have never received emails from showbusiness publicists imploring them to attend an event because it will have ‘ a big celebrity turnout ’			0
the mps on the committee addressed the witnesses by their @entity300 names			0
the peers were more circumspect			0
@entity302 ( @entity224 ) gushed that the room ’s public seats were packed ( not true , as it happens )			0
@entity306 , former @entity307 , covered his face and closed his eyes during long passages of evidence			1
disgust or an attack of the post-prandial zeds ? both forgivable			0
@entity314 ( @entity224 ) , having heard mr @entity1 suggest that mps deserved less privacy than other people , was puzzled as to how this could be made to work in law			0
mr @entity1 agreed it was complicated			0
mr @entity13 said freelance photographers had tried to run over the grandmother of a child he fathered			1
mr @entity30 , who at one point used the @entity326 term ‘ @entity317 ’ , was asked about press regulation			0
he wanted ‘ a body ’			0
the man is incorrigible ! actor @entity13 claims the press harassed the mother of his new born son after the birth mr @entity15 had been to the word factory			1
he described stories about celebrities ’ sex lives as ‘ tawdry dirt ’			0
he has the makings of a red - top sub-editor			0
mr @entity1 was perhaps the least dogmatic of the quartet but then went and stepped in a cowpat			0
he compared nosy newspapers to @entity4 concentration camp			0
that he was sitting next to @entity347 ’s son when he said this somehow accentuated the looseness of the remark			0
lord @entity350 ( @entity351 ) wondered why mr @entity13 , having been bullied by out - of - control paparazzi , did not seek legal redress for harassment			1
mr @entity13 , so far as i could follow , agreed that he had eventually done something like that			1
so why the need for a law on privacy which would probably help chiefly lawyers , sado - masochist freaks , libidinous actors and passing totalitarians ?			0

@entity366 later conceded he could have phrased his words differently
@entity13 and @entity15 also give evidence to the joint commons and @entity371
