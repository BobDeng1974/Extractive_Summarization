by @entity0 published : 06:29 est , 13 november 2012 updated : 09:46 est , 15 november 2012 @entity1 pictured outside the @entity3 home which she has put on the rental market for free a couple whose house was trashed by a past tenant and stripped bare by thieves have put their three - bedroomed terrace on the market rent free - as long as the occupier does n't mind renovating the property while they live there			1
private landlords @entity1 , 30 , and her husband @entity17 , 46 , have made the unusual proposition as they look for a @entity20 enthusiast to take on their @entity3 property			1
they hope that a new resident can give the end terrace a new lease of life after it was left uninhabitable by a previous tenant			2
she was evicted after knocking holes in the walls , burning the garage down and allowing her pet cat to defecate all over the floor			0
but the couple 's nightmare did n't end when the tenant finally moved out			1
once the property was empty , metal thieves smashed their way in through rear windows and stripped the house of it pipes , boiler and electrical wiring			1
repairs will now cost between £ 17,000 and £ 23,000			2
mrs @entity45 said : ' it was a lovely house , it was all done up to a good standard and it was a nice place to live			2
' this tenant completely trashed the place so obviously we asked her to leave			2
' we could n't afford to do it up again and slowly but surely people noticed it was empty and it became a target			0
' they 've taken everything except the floorboards - the circuit board , the boiler and all the piping has gone			0
' it 's in a desperate state of disrepair			0
' @entity1 , originally from @entity65 , added : ' we found the property in the state it was in after the tenant fell into arrears			1
' she had been a tenant at another of our houses , but it was badly damaged in a chip pan fire and we re-homed her in another one of our properties			0
the house was left in a terrible state of disrepair after a previous tenant trashed the place and metal thieves stripped it bare @entity1 and @entity84 are now hoping that a new tenant can fix the mess their terrace has been left in , pictured , and give the house a new lease of life the house will need completely gutting after the previous tenant put holes in he walls , allowed her dog to defecate everywhere and burnt the garage down metal thieves smashed into the house through the rear windows , which are seen here boarded up ' we were carrying out refurbishment to the home she had left , and the one she moved into was beautiful			1
' the previous tenants had really looked after it			0
we spruced it up for her but it came to light that she 'd fallen into arrears			0
' we found out the property was ruined in january , so we took steps to evict her			0
it 's a lengthy process and the law is not on the side of landlords , so she left the property in april			0
' the @entity125 's , who own seven properties in @entity3 and a further house in @entity129 , will make the house safe to live in by fitting new windows and electrics before anyone moves in - but the tenant will be expected to do all the @entity20 work to their own taste			1
any building materials needed to return the house to its former glory will be supplied by the pair			0
the @entity142 will charge between £ 425 and £ 475 per month to rent the house , pictured left , when extensive renovations to damage , right , are carried out @entity146 says that pretty much all that is left of the terraced house is the floorboards			1
but even some of those are missing judging by this photo thieves even went so far as stealing pipes , cables and the electric circuit board from the house the property hardly looks like an ideal love nest now , but its owners are hoping that new @entity20 - loving tenants will breath new life into the house and once the drastic makeover is complete , they will start to charge the occupiers rent - between £ 425 and £ 475 per month , in line with similar properties in the area			1
mrs @entity45 said that the pair will hold @entity173 - style auditions to make sure that they rent the house to a reliable tenant this time around			1
she said : ' we 're expecting an @entity179 audition process where people will talk us through what they want to do to the property			0
' we 'll find out who is genuine about the property and who just wants free rent			2
' the design they choose has to be agreeable and liveable , so we 'll come to an agreement over what they are going to do and that will be written into the contract			0
' even the ceilings of the @entity3 terrace will need a renovation as this picture shows with some @entity198 , this space could become a dream living room for the home 's new occupants the carpets will need replacing after the previous tenant let her pet defecate on the floor			1

@entity1 and @entity84 's @entity3 terrace was trashed by a former tenant and then stripped by *opportunist* metal thieves
the couple will fit new windows and electrics , but a new tenant will be expected to *redecorate* the house while living there rent - free
in good *condition* it would rent for up to £ 475 a month
