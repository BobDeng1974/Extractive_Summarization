by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity4 scrum - half @entity2 , who is on loan from @entity6 , was at the heart of the @entity8 ’ 42 - 6 triumph , only their second win in five matches , which keeps them within four points of eighth - placed @entity15 with two matches left of the regular season			1
@entity2 ’s half - back partner @entity18 was also influential on his return from a six - week injury lay - off			0
@entity22 suffered a blow before kick - off when skipper @entity25 failed a late fitness test on a knee injury sustained in training but they produced a near - perfect opening quarter to take a grip on the game and never looked like relinquishing their hold			0
try : @entity35 crosses for one of @entity22 's tries get in there : @entity22 's jubilant players celebrate with try scorer @entity40 loose forward @entity41 did the early damage , breaking clear to send veteran prop @entity43 romping over for his first try for more than 12 months before getting on the end of @entity2 ’s grubber kick to touch down himself			1
that made it 10 - 0 after 14 minutes and it got even better for the home side when right winger @entity50 collected @entity52 ’s kick to the corner to score a third try , to which @entity55 added a second goal			1
@entity6 had earlier showed a glimpse of their attacking flair when @entity62 full - back @entity60 got winger @entity63 on a dangerous run but it was only after they fell 16 - 0 behind that they started to exert any pressure on the @entity22 line			1
opener : @entity43 crosses for @entity22 's first score the @entity8 defence proved up to the task , however , with the @entity74 going closest to scoring when hooker @entity75 was held up over the line			1
@entity22 created the first opening of the second half when impressive forward @entity79 got @entity55 into a hole before being pulled back for a forward pass and @entity6 made the most of the let - off			2
former @entity85 favourite @entity84 breached the @entity22 line on halfway and second rower @entity89 charged over from 50 metres for his side ’s only try , his first since february			2
@entity60 ’s conversion cut the gap to 10 points but there was no way back for the visitors when centre @entity40 went over for their fourth try on 55 minutes , which was just reward for their decision to run a penalty from in front of the posts			2
@entity55 was wide with the conversion attempt but was on target three minutes later when second rower @entity107 took @entity52 ’s pass 10 metres from the line and proved unstoppable as he powered his way over for @entity22 ’s fifth try			0
it was all one - way traffic in the final quarter as the @entity8 piled on the misery for their out - of - touch visitors			0
@entity40 produced a superb flick pass for winger @entity117 to touch down and @entity118 was rewarded for his industry when he got his hand to @entity52 ’s grubber kick			0
a 40 - 20 kick from @entity55 , another impressive performer at full - back , then set up the position for @entity117 to round off the scoring with his second try a minute from the end .			0

@entity2 , on loan at @entity22 from @entity6 , is *instrumental* in *crushing* victory for @entity8
home side run in eight tries to *comfortably* secure the points
@entity117 runs in two tries , added to by scores from @entity43 , @entity41 , @entity50 , @entity40 and @entity107
@entity6 reply with solitary @entity89 try
*wildcats* win keeps slim play - off hopes alive
three points *adrift* of eighth - placed @entity15 with three matches remaining
