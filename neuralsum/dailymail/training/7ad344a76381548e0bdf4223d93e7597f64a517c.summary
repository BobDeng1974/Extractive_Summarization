so we are doing well without spending big money			0
@entity3 warmed up for top of the bale clash by thrashing @entity50 5 - 1 at @entity51 ‘ maybe at that time ( under @entity2 ) it was about paying a lot of money to convince players to come here			1
now it is about getting players here who believe in the project			0
that ’s the most important thing			0
’ @entity0 , who was fined £ 2,000 and serves a one - match touchline ban after admitting an @entity60 charge of improper conduct following his sending - off against @entity65 , added : ‘ i looked at what @entity2 did here			1
if i knew now that in the future i would achieve what he did then i would be a happy man			0
we are just one year in and we are in the @entity30 , promotion is the first step and that is very tough			0
’ the two managers live in the same part of @entity73 , and @entity0 said : ‘ sometimes we have been in the same restaurant and we have a good relationship			1
