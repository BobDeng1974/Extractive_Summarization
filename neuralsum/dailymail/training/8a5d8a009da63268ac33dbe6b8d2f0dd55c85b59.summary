@entity1 pupils must study two religions under government plans to tackle extremism in schools following the @entity7 plot			1
changes to religious studies qualifications are expected to be set out by ministers next week when the subject criteria for @entity12 is published			1
faith schools are likely to see the biggest impact as they can currently choose to teach their own religion and disregard others			1
under new government plans to tackle extremism in schools , @entity1 pupils will have to study two religions as well as studying at least two religions , pupils will also be expected to debate moral dilemmas in the context of religious beliefs in class			1
the modifications to lessons comes after the alleged @entity7 plot by hardline @entity1 to infiltrate schools in @entity29			1
it was originally sparked by a leaked letter in march this year - now widely believed to be a hoax - which alleged to be from @entity33 in the city plotting to seize control of a number of school governing bodies			0
@entity38 revealed a month later that it had received ' hundreds ' of allegations of similar school takeover plots - some dating back 20 years			0
@entity42 , chairman of the @entity43 which runs six schools in the city , resigned after he was found to have written a detailed blueprint in 2007 for the radical ' @entity47 ' of secular state schools			1
the government hopes by tweaking religious studies lesson criteria it will help tackle cultural isolationism and extremism			1
but despite this , schools will be able to decide how much teaching time to give each faith - so pupils could spend three quarters of the course studying one faith and just a quarter on the other			1
changes are expected to be set out by ministers next week when the subject criteria for @entity12 is published @entity66 was one of those that was at the centre of the @entity7 plot by hardline @entity1 to infiltrate schools in @entity29 teachers will also have to give sharper focus to the study of faith and steer away from the current method of dividing studies into philosophy and ethics			1
while teenagers will be expected to answer questions on ethics with reference to religious beliefs			1
the new syllabus will also have an extra option that places more emphasis on the study of religious texts , practices and sources of authority			1
however , a-level students will continue to be able to study only one religion if they choose under the new criteria			1
the amendments have been broadly welcomed by the @entity96			0
reverend @entity97 , the @entity96 's chief education officer , told @entity99 : ' studying two religions with a further detailed text based study for one of the religions at @entity12 will promote depth and breadth and equip students to be religiously literate in today 's world			2
' @entity109 , chief executive of the @entity110 , also told the paper : ' it is hugely important that all young people learn about the full range of different religious and non-religious beliefs that are common in society today			2
' such learning makes a vital contribution to respect and tolerance of individuals with different beliefs			0
' mr @entity109 added that the change is welcome progress but does not go as far as he would have liked			0
sir @entity125 said the plot was ' planned and orchestrated ' attempt to control school boards the @entity7 plot first came to light earlier this year , when a letter emerged outlining an alleged a plot by @entity1 hardliners to drive moderate headteachers out of schools			1
the letter prompted @entity137 inspectors to go into @entity66 in @entity29 along with its sister schools , @entity139 and @entity140			2
whistleblowers at @entity66 claimed the school was in the hands of a group of extremists who had infiltrated its governing body			0
it is alleged girls at the school were forced to sit at the back of the classroom and @entity152 pupils forced to teach themselves at the state school			2
the letter prompted separate ongoing investigations by both the @entity137 ( @entity137 ) and @entity157 in to the school and several others in the area			0
following inspections , sir @entity125 told @entity162 in july that there had been a ' planned and orchestrated ' plot to radicalise pupils in schools in the city			1
he told the @entity168 said : ' i spoke to eight or nine head teachers			0
they believed it was planned and orchestrated			0
' they believed people got together and decided which schools to target			2
they believed there was a strategy to infiltrate governing bodies			2
' they believed governing boards could n't take place in the normal way			0
they believed all that was planned and orchestrated			0
this was all in @entity29			0
' when asked by mps if pupils had been radicalised in the schools , sir @entity125 replied : ' we did n't see that			2
the issue of extremism was outside of our remit			0
' the @entity157 chief inspector told @entity162 : ' what we did see was the promotion of a culture , which if that promotion had continued would have exposed these children to extremism			0
