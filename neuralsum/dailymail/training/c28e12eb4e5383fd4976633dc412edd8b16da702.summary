by @entity1 reporter published : 07:18 est , 6 july 2012 updated : 10:03 est , 6 july 2012 two former dictators who oversaw the systematic stealing of babies from political prisoners in @entity6 30 years ago have been sentenced to a total of 65 years in prison			1
the convictions of @entity10 and @entity11 has been seen as a big step in @entity6 's effort to punish the human rights abuses of that era , although authorities say it is certainly not the last			1
at least 17 other major cases are before judges or are nearing trial			1
' historic day ' : former @entity6 dictators @entity10 ( left ) and @entity11 ( right ) have been sentenced to 50 years and 15 years in prison respectively for the systematic thefts of babies from political prisoners among them is a ' mega-trial ' involving the @entity27 , which became a feared torture center as the 1976 - 1983 military junta kidnapped and killed 13,000 opponents while trying to annihilate an armed leftist uprising			1
that case involves 65 defendants , nearly 900 victims , more than 100 witnesses and about 60,000 pages of evidence			0
a ' @entity40 ' commission formed shortly after @entity6 's democracy was restored in 1983 documented thousands of crimes against humanity during the military regime , but hardly any of the violators were prosecuted until the late @entity45 was elected president 20 years later			2
justice minister @entity47 said thursday that @entity45 's wife and successor , president @entity50 , deserves credit for making the human rights cases a cornerstone of government			2
sentenced : the former military leaders in court to hear their punishments after going on trial earlier this year for atrocities committed during the late 70s and early 80s ' it 's unthinkable that in a state of law , the murderers of the people could be in any place but prison , ' @entity47 said after the verdicts were read			1
@entity10 , 86 , was sentenced to 50 years in prison , while the 84 - year - old @entity11 got 15 years for their roles in the baby thefts			1
the prison time is symbolic , though , because both men have been behind bars for years following multiple convictions and life sentences for other crimes against humanity			0
seven of their co-defendants were also convicted on charges involving the theft of 34 babies , while two people were acquitted by a three - judge panel			2
despite the jailing of @entity10 and @entity11 , most people who have been convicted of rights violations during the dictatorship remain free on appeal and many others have yet to stand trial			1
dictators : @entity10 ( left ) and @entity11 ( right ) during their time in charge of @entity6			1
tens of thousands of people vanished during their regime sworn in : lieutenant general @entity99 ( centre ) takes an oath as president in march 1976 according to a march tally by @entity6 's independent @entity105 , a total of 1,861 defendants have been named in cases of state terror , but verdicts were reached for only 17 per cent of them - with 92 per cent of those found guilty			1
since the trials began in 2006 , at least 65 have resulted in sentences , but only seven of these have exhausted an appeals process that takes more than two years on average			0
still , thursday 's verdicts were a cause for celebration outside the federal courthouse in @entity122 , where activists watched them being announced on a huge television screen			0
' this is an historic day			1
today legal justice has been made real - never again the justice of one 's own hands , which the repressors were known for , ' prominent rights activist @entity126 said			1
the baby thefts set @entity6 's military regime apart from all the other juntas that ruled in @entity135 at the time			0
@entity10 and other military and police officials were determined to remove any trace of the armed leftist guerrilla movement they said threatened the country 's future			1
@entity6 president @entity99 ( center ) after he had presented the @entity146 to @entity6 's captain @entity147 ( number 19 ) in 1978 many pregnant women detained as dissidents were ' disappeared ' shortly after giving birth in clandestine maternity wards , and their babies were handed over to families trusted by military officials			1
in his testimony , @entity10 denied there was any systematic program for stealing babies , and accused prisoners of using their unborn children as ' human shields ' in their fight against the state			2
he called himself a ' political prisoner , ' labeled the trial a farce and characterized his sentence as revenge by people who after being defeated militarily now occupy positions in the government			0
despite this , @entity10 said , he would accept his sentence ' in protest , as an act of service , ' and with a clear conscience			0
witnesses during the trial included former @entity181 diplomat @entity180			0
he was called to testify after a long - classified memo describing his secret meeting with @entity6 's ambassador was made public at the request of the @entity187 , a human rights group whose evidence - gathering efforts were key to the prosecution			0
the @entity192 protest for their missing familiy members during the first @entity194 against the @entity6 dictatorship @entity180 testified from @entity196 that he secretly urged that @entity11 reveal the stolen babies ' identities as a way to smooth @entity6 's return to democracy			2
' we knew that it was n't just one or two children , ' @entity180 testified , suggesting that there must have been some sort of directive from a high level official - ' a plan , because there were many people who were being murdered or jailed			0
' no reconciliation effort was made			0
instead , @entity11 ordered the military to destroy evidence of ' dirty war ' activities , and the junta denied any knowledge of baby thefts , let alone responsibility for the disappearances of political prisoners			2
the @entity181 government also revealed little of what it knew as the junta 's death squads were eliminating opponents			0
the @entity228 have since used dna evidence to help 106 people who were stolen from prisoners as babies recover their true identities , and 26 of these cases were part of this trial			1
many were raised by military officials or their allies , who falsified their birth names , trying to remove any hint of their leftist origins			2
the rights group estimates as many as 500 babies could have been stolen in all , but the destruction of documents and passage of time make it impossible to know for sure			0
the trial featured gut - wrenching testimony from relatives who searched inconsolably for their missing children , and from people who learned as young adults that they were raised by some of the very people involved in the disappearance of their birth parents			0
the other seven defendants convicted and sentenced thursday included former @entity261 , 40 years ; former marine @entity262 , 30 ; former gen @entity263 , 20 ; former navy prefect @entity264 , 14 ; and dr @entity265 , who witnesses said handled some of the births , 10			0
former capt @entity269 and his ex-wife @entity270 were sentenced to 15 and five years in jail , respectively , after their adopted son , now going by his birth name @entity274 , testified against them .			2

@entity10 , 86 , sentenced to 50 years behind bars
84 - year - old @entity11 handed a 15 - year term
tried to remove traces of leftist guerrilla movement
babies taken off detainees and handed to the military
@entity288 later used to *reunite* 106 people with their families
' this is historic day ' , says prominent rights activist
at least 17 other major abuse cases before judges
one includes atrocities at torture centre from 1976 - 83
