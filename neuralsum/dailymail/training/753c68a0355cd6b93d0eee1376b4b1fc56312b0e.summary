a former @entity1 colleague of @entity2 has claimed the predatory paedophile was a necrophiliac			1
it is one of the most extraordinary allegations to have come out in the wake of the scandal			0
the claim was made on @entity11 today by @entity12 , who started working as a dj on @entity14 in 1973			0
he questioned why newspapers had not acted when he said a reporter had boasted that his colleagues were aware of a story linking @entity23 to ' necrophilia '			2
his comments astounded presenter @entity26 who tried to stop the conversation by warning the allegations were not in the public domain			2
@entity26 said : ' that particularly lurid accusation that you have just brought to people 's attention is one that has not been in the public domain			2
' @entity12 agreed and asked ' why not ? '			0
and he asked : ' who vetted the knighthood ? coco the clown ? he had worked with @entity2 at @entity14 where he had first heard stories about his abuse of under - age girls			1
he said the @entity1 was not the only organisation at fault for failing to expose @entity2 , saying the press was equally to blame			1
he claimed a reporter was heard talking at a wedding 10 years ago about @entity2 being a necrophiliac			1
he said that he used a ' politically incorrect ' term to categorise the people to whom @entity2 devoted his attentions			1
he said : ' the expression i came to associate with @entity2 's sexual partners was either one used by production assistants or one i made up to summarise their reports ... " under - age subnormals "			1
' he targeted the institutionalised , the hospitalised - and this was known			0
why did @entity2 go to hospitals ? that 's where the patients were			1
' @entity12 said the @entity1 was not the only organisation at fault for failing to expose @entity2 , saying the press was equally to blame			1
mr @entity12 continued to say today that @entity2 's alleged abuse was taking place at a time when staff failed to get to grips with the concept of paedophilia			1
' it was considered so far beyond the pale that people did n't believe it happened , ' he said during the 5 @entity77			0
he said the entire society was taken in by @entity2 - ' including the prime minister who invited him to @entity80 ; including the royal family , photographed with him , he got a knighthood in this country , he got a papal knighthood			1
' this is not just the @entity1 this is history , this is a man who conned an entire society , ' @entity12 added			2
it also emerged earlier this month that @entity2 denied claims he was sexually attracted to corpses in an interview in 1990 , after he admitted taking pleasure in taking the deceased to @entity96 mortuary			1
the hospital , where @entity2 worked as a volunteer and had his own room , said that it has never received claims that @entity2 ' inappropriately interacted ' with corpses			1
a spokesman said : ' we are not launching an investigation into claims that @entity2 was a necrophiliac			1
we have never received any complaints as to that nature			0
' ' during our time , to the best of our knowledge , @entity2 was not given free access around our clinical areas and whenever he attended the hospital he would give advance notice and usually be in attendance with his fundraising team			2
' admittance : @entity116 and @entity117 appearing on this morning			0
mr @entity116 admitted he was aware of the abuse allegations about @entity119 because of his work on a story about convicted paedophile @entity122 in the 1990 interview with @entity125 , @entity123 reported @entity2 was given the job of taking the dead to the mortuary			1
@entity2 , who died last year at 84 , said : ' one of my jobs is to take away the deceased			2
you can look after somebody , be alone with somebody , who has lived a whole lifetime , and i ’m just saying goodbye and looking after him			0
' that is a privilege and an honour			0
some people get hold of the fact that @entity142 likes looking after cadavers and say , " @entity144 , @entity142 ’s a necrophiliac ! ’ i ’m not a necrophiliac "			1
' in an interview on @entity149 's @entity148 today @entity116 admitted he was aware of the abuse allegations because of his work on a story about convicted paedophile @entity122			2
' do n't forget i was the one that broke the @entity122 story , and when the people that came to me to tell me about @entity122 , @entity2 's name came up several times in those conversations			1
that was years ago ... i passed it all on			0
' asked by @entity161 if he passed the allegations on to the police , @entity116 replied : ' no , the people concerned			0
the people that came to see me			0
' and two or three of the people that came to see me did n't then fulfil their story with @entity122 for their own reasons ... it 's up to the people concerned to go to the police			2
it 's not for me to say			0
they 're the ones that this happened to or experienced it or saw it			0
' he justified his actions saying you can not ' make someone go the police			0
' ' it 's their lives , it 's their future			0
the information does n't stack up unless they are prepared to go to the police and explain it			0
' he also alluded to the fact other figures could be implicated in the scandal , with @entity116 saying : ' oh , there 's lots of other people			2

former @entity1 @entity201 said he was aware of claims in the eighties
