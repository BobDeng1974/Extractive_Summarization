fining the company , judge @entity73 at @entity15 , said : ' the company had become aware of the risks [ prior to the incident ] of cooking , cooling , and re-heating , turkeys but had took manifestly inadequate steps in addressing that risk			0
' landlady @entity24 - @entity10 and chef @entity9 were jailed for 18 months and 12 months each he added : ' the company is a substantial concern , with a turnover of £ 1.96billion and a pre-tax profit in the region of £ 125million			1
' in these circumstances , my judgement is that fine should be £ 1.5m			0
this figure is of a level that recognises the seriousness of the offence , taking into the company 's means			0
' it brings home to business management and shareholders the need to operate within the law			0
' he added : ' they was a systematic failure in record - keeping at the @entity12			2
' addressing @entity57 and @entity10 , the judge said : ' following the discovery of the food poisoning outbreak on december 26 , mrs @entity10 and mr @entity9 , you both embarked upon the fabrication of the kitchen 's due diligence logs			1
' i am satisfied that you , mrs @entity10 , were in charge of the process and caused mr @entity9 to get involved			2
' two victim impact statements were read to the court , from mrs @entity0 's husband @entity117 and her father @entity118			2
@entity18 , owner of the @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , pictured , were fined £ 1.5 milllion mr @entity120 struggled to control his emotions as his statement was read out by the prosecutor @entity123 - @entity124 : ' when @entity0 was killed our lives fell apart , @entity0 's passing was completely avoidable and all three defendants appear to have little , or no , indications what their actions have caused			1
' it added : ' life will never be the same , my daughter @entity134 , will now grow - up without @entity0 by her side , and that is simply unforgivable			2
' mr @entity118 added : ' i 've lost my zest for life			0
' during the trial mrs @entity0 's husband @entity117 , who was also struck down by the food bug , described his wife 's death as ' horrific			2
' mr @entity120 , 53 , said : ' i was getting increasingly concerned as the day went on			0
the vomiting and diarrhoea would n't stop			0
@entity0 was a very private person			2
it was horrific to see what was going on			0
' he took his wife to @entity150 but her condition deteriorated on @entity42			0
' she got far , far , far , worse			0
i felt her physically shake and her eyes rolled , as if she was having a cardiac arrest			0
' she was rushed to @entity159 , @entity160 and pronounced dead at 8.15am on december 27			0
@entity10 , who worked for the company for 24 years , and @entity57 were both cleared of one count of placing unsafe food on the market			1
the pub were ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £ 120 , and @entity57 and @entity10 were each ordered to pay £ 100			2
the court heard that the cost of the trial to the public purse was £ 273,000			1
however , the court has yet to decide if , or how much , of that sum will be paid by the pub chain			1
the court heard that on christmas day 2012 the pub put on a lunch for 128 customers			1
but turkey meat prepared the day before was not cooled properly after it was cooked , and then was not adequately reheated before it was served to guests			1
diners were left with food poisoning and two days later mrs @entity0 died			1
the court was told that food safety records had not been filled in , and so @entity10 , of @entity13 , @entity14 , who had worked at the hotel for 24 years , concocted a plan for her and @entity57 to falsify them			1
the pair ' covered their own backs ' by retrospectively filling out false due diligence logs over the cooking , cooling and reheating of the meat before environmental health inspectors could carry out an investigation			0
prosecuting , @entity123 - @entity196 told the court it was ' highly likely that other food - related records were fabricated '			2
mr @entity201 told the court that , although records prior to that december were unavailable , ' the inference is that for many , many months record - keeping and policies diverged '			2
he added : ' ms @entity10 was clearly in charge of the process of fabrication and caused a number of others to be involved in it , including members of staff and her family			0
' interviews with staff were not disclosed , and nor were records such as stock transfer logs which may have shown where the turkey came from			0
the pair were acquitted at the trial of a charge of placing unsafe food on the market , of which the @entity226 pub 's owner @entity18 was found guilty			1
speaking after the hearing , @entity228 , @entity230 's @entity229 member for regulatory services , said : ' our condolences go out to the @entity0 family , who have been in court throughout the trial			2
' we hope that this morning 's result will act as an impetus for all food providers , both local and across the country , to ensure that their food hygiene regimes are thorough and robust			0
' @entity244 , for @entity18 said : ' this case was a tragedy , it 's beyond argument that the incident had terrible consequences and the company deeply , deeply regrets it			2
' he added : ' the tragic death of ms @entity0 is an aggravating feature , if the company had been following procedure , the staff could have been more effectively reminded of how to cook , cool and reheat the turkey			2
' @entity257 , for @entity10 , said : ' she was at all times very sorry for what happened and her remorse which was clearly there for all to see was real			0
he added : ' it was n't falsification prompted by any realisation that they had committed any specific error but a realisation that the form filling that had been required of them by their company had not been done			0
' he said that since the incident , @entity10 has lost both her job and also her home because she lived at the @entity12			2
she has been living with her family on benefits , and mr @entity257 said she has no hope of getting a job in the catering industry again			0
he said : ' it 's sad that someone of her capabilities should be laid so low			0
' @entity284 , for @entity57 , said : ' it was clear from the evidence that he was put under pressure to fill in these logs and he was told what to put - when he fabricated these records it 's not because he was aware of what had happened or was aware of the death , it was because records that should have been had not been filled in			0
' judge @entity296 said : ' the essence of this offence is that the company was aware of the risks relating to the cooking , cooling and reheating of turkey meat , and the weekly bulletin was a wholly ineffective way of alerting staff to these risks and disseminating information			0
' sentencing @entity10 to 18 months imprisonment , he said : ' you knew of the death of mrs @entity0 , and persisted with your cover - up			1
' jailing @entity57 for 12 months he said : ' you also knew of the death of mrs @entity0 but you too persisted in the cover - up , i accept that there are mitigating factors			1
' first of all you were in a subordinate position and were directed by ms @entity10 to embark upon a course of conduct that left you in a difficult position			0
' @entity10 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , was cleared of one count of placing unsafe food on the market but found guilty of one count of perverting the course of justice			1
she was also cleared of obstructing a police officer			0
