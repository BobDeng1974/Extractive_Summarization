it took just a matter of hours for the councillor to post the fruits of her labour on @entity21 - with a shameless plug for the lingerie store thrown in for good measure			1
she also linked her tweets twice to the shop , before also giving a shout out to her friend @entity36 , who had watched on as mrs @entity6 struck a number of pouting poses in her snug - fitting corset			2
it 's hardly surprising that mrs @entity6 chose to turn her latest shopping trip turned into yet another opportunity to add to her ever - expanding gallery of selfies			1

ms @entity115 also branded mrs @entity6 a ' trowel ' over the amount of make - up she uses			0
some might also question whether the basque - like one - piece is becoming for a councillor and wife of a high - profile figure in @entity96 ’s @entity127			2
but mrs @entity6 appears to be undeterred by the criticism , as these images show			0
in another bid for self - promotion , mrs @entity6 this week announced she would take ' one lucky winner ' on a date this saturday for @entity105 's day , depending on who bid the most for the privilege			1
