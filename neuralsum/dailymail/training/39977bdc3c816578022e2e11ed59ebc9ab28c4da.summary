by @entity0 published : 11:11 est , 12 november 2013 @entity2 : 11:16 est , 12 november 2013 physicist professor @entity3 , pictured , admitted he was disappointed when the @entity4 ' @entity6 particle ' was found the discovery of the @entity8 boson ‘ @entity6 particle ’ was widely considered the biggest scientific breakthrough of modern day - so much so it won this year ’s @entity10 - but not everyone was quite so impressed			1
leading physicist professor @entity3 has admitted he was disappointed by the discovery and believes ‘ physics would be far more interesting if it had not been found			1
’ the 71 - year - old made the claims during a sold - out event at @entity18 ’s @entity17 to celebrate the launch of its new collider exhibition			1
the exhibition gives visitors a behind - the - scenes look at the @entity26 and @entity27 particle physics laboratory in @entity28			1
the @entity4 's role is to give the particles that make up atoms their mass. it has been described as the ‘ missing piece ’ of the @entity35 , which explains how the parts of the universe that we understand interact with one another			0
without this mass , particles would zip around the cosmos , unable to bind together to form the atoms that make stars and planets - and people			0
the particle was confirmed using the @entity26 - the highest - energy particle collider ever made , built by the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) in 2012			1

however , our knowledge of particle physics is still far from complete , with mysteries such as the nature of dark matter to still be solved			0
professor @entity3 also had a more personal reason to lament the discovery , which earned @entity78 scientist professor @entity8 a £ 776,000 share of the @entity10			1
‘ i had a bet with @entity80 of @entity81 that the @entity8 particle would n't be found , ’ he said			2
‘ the @entity10 cost me $ 100			2
’ during this talk , the @entity8 also discussed being the longest known survivor of @entity85 , or motor neurone disease , and his slacker days as a student of natural science at @entity90			0
he admitted he once calculated he did about 1,000 hours of work during his three years at @entity90 - an average of an hour a day			2
‘ because of my lack of work , i had planned to get through the final exam by doing problems in theoretical physics and avoiding questions that required factual knowledge			0
' but i did n't sleep the night before the exam , because of nervous tension , and so i did n't do very well			0
i was on the borderline between a first and second class degree			0
’ nonetheless @entity3 was awarded a first and went on to pursue a career in mathematics and cosmology at @entity107 , where he is now director of research at the @entity108			2
professor @entity3 also explained why he believes in one of the most exotic ideas in physics today , m - theory , which proposes the existence of a myriad different universes all created out of nothing			1
‘ these multiple universes can arise naturally from physical law , ’ said professor @entity3			2
professor @entity3 also had a personal reason to lament the discovery , which earned professor @entity8 , pictured at the @entity26 exhibition , the @entity10			1
professor @entity3 said : ' i had a bet with @entity80 of @entity81 that the @entity8 particle would n't be found			1
the @entity10 cost me $ 100			2
' ‘ each universe has many possible histories and many possible states at later times , that is , at times like the present , long after their creation			0
' most of these states will be quite unlike the universe we observe , and quite unsuitable for the existence of any form of life			0
only a very few would allow creatures like us to exist			0
‘ thus , our presence selects out from the vast array only those universes that are compatible with our existence			0
although we are puny and insignificant on the scale of the @entity146 , this makes us , in a sense , lords of creation			0
’ professor @entity3 believes it is possible the first evidence for m - theory will be seen at the @entity26			1
the theoretical physicist also said that the future of the human race depends on going into space			0
‘ i do n't think we will survive another thousand years without escaping beyond our fragile planet , ’ professor @entity3 continued			2
ending his talk , he told his audience : ‘ so remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet			0
try to make sense of what you see and hold on to that child - like wonder about what makes the universe exist			0
’ professor @entity3 also explained why he believes in m - theory , which proposes the existence of different universes all created out of nothing			1
he believes it is possible the first evidence for m - theory will be seen at the @entity26 , as celebrated at the @entity17 's latest exhibition pictured			1

professor @entity3 made the claims at the @entity17 in @entity18
he said the discovery of the so - called @entity6 particle was ' disappointing '
he also admitted he bet a fellow physicist $ 100 that it would never be found
the 71 - year - old was speaking at the launch of the *museum* ’s new @entity26 exhibition
