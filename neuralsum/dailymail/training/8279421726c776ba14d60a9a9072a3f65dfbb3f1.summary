does @entity0 want to be here ? when @entity4 arrived at @entity5 , we all thought : ‘ wow , what an addition to the @entity8 ! ’ now he looks like he ’s not interested			1
at the start of the season , @entity0 was gliding across the field , but at the moment he looks weak and sluggish			2
we all know what he is capable of and the @entity5 fans deserve better			1
@entity4 ( right ) struggled to make an impact at @entity16 , seen up against midfielder @entity17 it does n’t help when your manager over-complicates things , but @entity21 has been nowhere near good enough for a player who cost so much			1
his form has dipped dramatically , as our table shows , and if he does n’t improve there will be some serious stick coming his way			2
there is not a player in the world who does n’t go through a bad patch but we all want to see more from him			2
i certainly hope his dip does n’t suggest he will be angling for pastures new in the summer			2
@entity36 striker @entity35 celebrates having scored the @entity38 's second at @entity39 on saturday @entity35 hits 50 a lot of people , myself included , have been critical of @entity35 in the past			1
there has always been too much focus on what he ca n’t do rather than what he can			2
but now he is an absolutely key man for @entity36			1
he ’s not your typical @entity38 player			2
he ’s big , strong and likes to play through the middle , but his role at the top of the team lets the rest of the creative dynamos buzz around him			0
he scores headers , which is a different weapon for @entity36 , and with 50 goals now it ’s no wonder @entity61 values him so highly			1
@entity63 's tough job the last thing you want in your first game in charge is to face a @entity69 team			1
it was a hard start for @entity72 ’s @entity71 and i bet even he is surprised by the task he now faces			0
his appointment was a coup for the club but he has a job on his hands			1
that squad is too good to go down			0
@entity72 manager @entity71 , roars in celebration at @entity82 , has a tough task to keep his side up @entity86 's fab four @entity86 took @entity87 apart on saturday			1
that ’s because they finally had their best midfield playing			0
when @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 start , @entity86 win			2
unfortunately for them it has only happened three times this season — against @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity87			1
injuries and absences mean they have not played often enough but they were a joy to watch			0
@entity86 play off the cuff and with that four they are much more fluid			0
using @entity105 and @entity95 is too defensive and with @entity92 flying and @entity93 over that poor patch at the start of the season , @entity86 looked back to their best			0
@entity111 it will be interesting to see if @entity112 or @entity113 gets the nod against @entity115 tomorrow			0
@entity112 ( right ) has had his problems but he ’s a good player			0
@entity113 was sent off in their tie last year so if @entity112 plays , he must be ready for @entity119 @entity112 ( right ) in action for @entity86 in their 5 - 0 win against @entity87 on saturday evening it 's tight in the championship 7 - @entity125 has scored seven goals in eight games for @entity128 since his loan move in january			1
@entity125 scored yet again for @entity128 to take them to the top of the championship			2
it was a great result for them to come from behind twice against @entity135 to win and with @entity137 and @entity138 losing , the race at the top of the @entity132 will go right to the wire			2
@entity128 are my favourites to win it now , but i bet @entity72 wish @entity125 was scoring all of these goals for them ... @entity143 defender @entity142 rises highest to beat @entity145 's @entity144 to the ball on sunday @entity142 's a rock 5 - @entity143 have kept five straight away clean sheets in the @entity8 for the first time since 1985			1
@entity150 and @entity151 will get the plaudits for their goals at @entity145 on sunday , but @entity142 has been vital for @entity143 in recent weeks			1
it was brave by @entity155 to switch to a back three and he has made that system work			0
it shows you what an intelligent manager he is			0
but it ’s players that make systems , and @entity142 has been a rock			1
it suits him to sit in the middle with men around him and he sees situations early			0
we know he ’s a brave , combative player but he has shown he is a classy operator too , and he has helped @entity143 get right back in the race for the top four			1
their home game against @entity86 on sunday will be huge			0
@entity142 ( centre ) blocks @entity179 's strike for @entity145 during the 2 - 0 win at @entity181 's @entity182 launches a charm offensive it was great to see @entity185 talking on @entity187 ’s goals on sunday programme and it made for some fascinating viewing			1
it was only a few weeks ago that he was refusing to speak to the media at all after @entity194 ’s ban			0
@entity182 obviously still feels key decisions are going against his team , so now he is back on the charm offensive to see if that helps			0
@entity199 late show spurs got away with one on sunday			0
they could have been three or four behind against @entity203 but did well to recover late in the game			0
they have won 16 points from losing positions this season , with most of those coming very late on			0
this week they will need it			0
a tough return leg against @entity215 in the @entity216 and a @entity218 final against @entity219 could make or break their season			0
it will be a real test for this young squad but they did well to make sure they did n’t start it off with a disappointing home defeat			0
@entity228 scored with the last kick of the game as @entity199 fought back to draw with @entity203 @entity231 's taken a backwards step i ’m not sure what ’s happened to @entity231			1
it ’s been more than two years since he scored on his @entity238 debut and back then he looked like one of the country ’s brightest youngsters			2
he was poor in the build - up for @entity244 ’s goals on saturday			2
now he needs to do better and start learning quickly			0
@entity246 's @entity8 number crunching 4 - @entity247 has been prolific for @entity219 recently			1
the powerful right back ( right ) has scored four goals in his last six games			2
he struck against @entity143 in the @entity218 , @entity72 and @entity251 in the @entity8 and @entity252 in the @entity253			1
@entity254 , @entity255 and @entity256 are the only other players to have scored in that period , with one each			2
17 - @entity143 have been the @entity8 ’s form side in 2015			1
they have won 17 out of a possible 21 points , winning five and drawing two games			0
9 - @entity262 had nine shots at goal without scoring against @entity265 , joint-most in a @entity8 game this season			1
@entity144 matched that tally against @entity270			0
560 - it has not been a good start to 2015 for @entity5 or @entity273			1
the @entity5 captain finally struck his first shot on target of the year in the @entity8 at @entity16			1
it took him 560 minutes to do so			0
@entity279 's red card was the ninth dismissal he has received over the course of a controversial career 3 - @entity279 has only played for three full seasons at @entity284 , but he has already been sent off three times for them — more than any other player in the club ’s @entity8 history			1
100 - @entity290 started his 100th consecutive @entity8 game on saturday			1
the @entity72 goalkeeper is the first to do so since @entity270 ’s @entity293 in october 2013			0
15 - @entity295 ’s header at @entity296 was @entity203 ’s 15th headed goal of the season			2
that ’s already more than any side managed last season			0
in 2013 - 14 , @entity143 scored the most headers with 14 .			1

club record *signing* @entity4 has not scored in 2015 for @entity5
@entity36 star @entity35 was on target again in 2 - 1 win at @entity98
@entity142 has been *instrumental* in @entity143 's recent *resurgence*
