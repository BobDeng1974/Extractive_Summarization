miss @entity8 , 19 , said that on the day of the building ’s collapse , she had rushed to work and did not have any breakfast			1
instead , she bought four small packets of biscuits on her way into work			1
it was a decision that would save her life – as she then rationed her scarce supply over the next two weeks			2
yesterday , miss @entity8 told hospital staff and her rescuers that she lived on the biscuits and bottles of water for the first 15 days – as she lay holed - up inside a cavity in the wreckage of the @entity52 building in the @entity32 area of @entity33			1
it is believed the lifesaving bottles of water reached her after they were thrown down a hole by rescue workers			1
the rescuers had been told to push the bottles down every hole and cavity they stumbled across – in the hope those trapped underneath would receive them			1
miss @entity8 – who lived alone in a rented room in @entity32 – said that when the eight - storey building collapsed , she was on the third floor			1
she managed to run down to the second floor but became trapped in a cavity			1
the cavity was big enough for her to move about in and there was enough air to breathe			2
but her hair had become stuck under a boulder , so she had to pull off strands to set herself free			2
recovering at the @entity76 in @entity32 , miss @entity8 said : ‘ no one heard me			1
i never dreamed i ’d see the daylight again			2
’ the seamstress now has trouble sleeping at night , and occasionally grips a nurse ’s hand in apparent panic attacks			0

' no one heard me			0
it was so bad for me			0
i never dreamed i 'd see the daylight again , ' she said			0
' there was some dried food around me			0
i ate the dried food for 15 days			1
' the last two days i had nothing but water			1
i used to drink only a limited quantity of water to save it			1
i had some bottles of water around me , ' she said			1
once she finally got their attention , the crews ordered the cranes and bulldozers to immediately stop work and used handsaws and welding and drilling equipment to cut through the iron rod and debris still trapping her			0
they gave her water , oxygen and saline as they worked to free her			1
when miss @entity8 was freed after 40 minutes , the crowd erupted in wild cheers			1
she was rushed to a military hospital in an ambulance , but her rescuers said she was in surprisingly good condition , despite her ordeal			1

the @entity247 earlier said 3,122 workers were employed at the five factories housed in the building , but it was not clear how many were there during the packed morning shift			0

the move came days after @entity4 agreed with the @entity295 to give safety ' the highest consideration ' , despite fears @entity256 bargain retailers might source goods elsewhere			2
' sixteen factories have been closed down in @entity33 and two in @entity303 , ' said textile minister @entity304 , adding that more could be shut if they do not meet strict new safety measures			0

i would take my little finger and wet my lips and swallow it , but the sicker i got as time went on , ’ he told the @entity350			0
