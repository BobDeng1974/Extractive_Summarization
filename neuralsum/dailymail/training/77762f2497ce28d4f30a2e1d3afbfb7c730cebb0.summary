by @entity1 reporter last updated at 4:31 pm on 29th june 2011 worries : academics claim less women became pregnant in the recession as they feared for their financial future the global economic downturn stopped the first rise in fertility rates in more than 40 years , research reveals today			1
academics found that the recession of 2008 - 09 led to a decline in fertility rates as young , professional women feared for their financial future if they became pregnant			1
the downturn which started three years ago brought to an end the first concerted rise in fertility rates in the developing world since the 1960s , the study found			1
in some large countries like the @entity25 and @entity26 , the recession actually reversed the upward fertility trend			2
in others like @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 , the rising fertility rates were interrupted , following a decade of generally rising fertility after 1998			1
the study by the @entity35 of the @entity36 found that there were differing reactions to the recession depending on sex , age , number of children , education level , and migrant status			0
scientists discovered that fertility rates in 26 of the 27 @entity49 nations were steadily rising until 2008 ( with stagnation in @entity51 ) , when they then began to either decline or stay the same in 17 countries			2
in 2009 13 @entity49 countries saw their fertility rates decline and another four countries experienced stable fertility rates			2
decline : the period @entity58 ( @entity58 ) representing number of children per woman either stagnated or declined in many @entity63 countries after 2008 , including @entity30 , @entity32 and the @entity64 researchers said that a rise in unemployment and general job uncertainty was a ' key factor ' behind this trend			2
the decline could last until 2013 , according to researchers , but is unlikely to affect overall worldwide population growth			0
@entity74 , one of the authors of the @entity35 study , said : ' highly educated women react to employment uncertainty by adopting a ' postponement strategy , ' especially if they are childless			0
' we have noted some specific patterns of behavior ; the young and the childless , for example , are less likely to have children during recessions			0
' in contrast , less - educated women often maintain or increase their fertility under economic uncertainty			0
' study : mr @entity74 said the current recession has been serious enough to have ' long - lasting effects ' on fertility mr @entity74 also noted that countries who have recently suffered severe debt problems such as @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity31 are likely to see much longer - term fertility declines			1
he added : ' countries like @entity96 , @entity31 , @entity97 , or @entity26 are likely to see protracted fertility declines due to a combination of very high unemployment and radical cuts in social spending			1
' it was also noted that for men , those with low education and skills faced increasing difficulty in finding a partner or supporting their family , and often showed the largest decline in first child birth rates			0
although previous downturns were too short to have a permanent impact on fertility , it has been said that the current recession has been sufficiently serious to have long - lasting effects			0
the study adds : ' massive cuts in public spending in many developed countries , including @entity26 and the @entity125 , aimed at reducing the budget deficit , will affect social and family - related expenditures and potentially also fertility			1
' the study by @entity74 and @entity130 from the @entity35 of the @entity36 and @entity131 from the @entity132 is published in the latest issue of @entity134 .			0

downturn ' stopped first fertility rise since 1960s '
debt - ridden countries like @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity31 particularly at risk of ' protracted fertility declines '
