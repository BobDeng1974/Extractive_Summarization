these seals appeared more like sardines when they packed themselves onto a crowded beach for a snooze the bizarre spectacle took place at the @entity15 rookery , @entity6 initially mistaking the animals for driftwood until , the photographer , on closer inspection , realised he 'd stumbled across the huge group of seals			1
he said : ‘ i had been on a family vacation and was looking for driftwood on the beaches with my daughter			2
‘ as we were returning to our hotel we spotted from a distance what looked like large pieces of driftwood			2
‘ but when we got a better look we realised the ' driftwood ' was moving and it was actually a large group of elephant seals			2
’ @entity41 is separated in to two beaches and can home as many as 15,000 elephant seals			0
during mr @entity0 's visit , there were as many as 3,000 lying on the two beaches			0
mr @entity0 , from @entity6 , said : ‘ at this time of year the seals are growing new skin and shedding their old skin			1
‘ the juveniles and females come first , followed by the young males and then the adult males			0
‘ the elephant seal molt is considered a ‘ catastrophic molt ’ because , unlike most mammals , it occurs in a short period of time			0
’ he added : ‘ i had not seen anything like this before , but now that i know about this place , i will visit it each time i travel up there			0
‘ it is truly an amazing sight to see so many animals clustered together but it can be quite noisy when they are not resting			0

thousands come ashore in @entity6 to shed annual layer of skin
