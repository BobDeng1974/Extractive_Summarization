within minutes of posting a romantic request on the popular parenting website , the 35 - year - old was deluged with more than 400 replies from women on the site			1
but sadly for the man , who advertised himself as being 6ft , athletic and well - endowed , the responses were from members of the website who were less than impressed			1
the mystery man using the pseudonym ‘ sheffieldguy ’ had boasted on the site that he was ‘ a very attentive and confident lover ’			1
but it was his insistence that he was ‘ not looking for a relationship , just some @entity32 ( no strings attached ) fun ’ , that seemed to rile the women			1
he quickly became the subject of ridicule on the website , as well as on @entity37 where hundreds of women took the opportunity to mock his plea			2
in his post on @entity8 on tuesday afternoon , the man wrote : ‘ i wonder if this gets tried a lot ? or am i the first guy to think of this angle ? this will probably get deleted in minutes , but hey , i ’ve got a day off with not much else to do			1
nothing ventured , nothing gained , as they say			2
‘ so , i ’m 35 , 6ft , athletic , well - endowed and recently single			1
i ’m not looking for a relationship , just some @entity32 ( no strings attached ) fun			1
not into one - night stand			1
i ’d rather click with someone a bit and have repeated fun whenever convenient for both of us			2
‘ he added : ‘ ( i am ) very open minded and quite kinky , but just as happy to have a more “ regular ” intimate encounter as well			2
‘ so if you ’re bored sexually at home , or not getting any at all ... drop me a private message			0
i ’m happy to travel up to an hour or so from @entity63			0
’ women on the site quickly started posting sarcastic replies , including : ‘ i bet your inbox is @entity68 ’			1
@entity69 , a site user , posted on @entity37 : ‘ bless his cotton socks			0
do n’t we all know a guy like that ? thinks he ’s @entity75 ’s gift to women			0
’ she added : ‘ and here ’s me on my own for a few days while @entity77 ( dear husband ) away on business			0
’ another added : ‘ have to admire that level optimism ! ! ’ while one wrote : ‘ what an old romantic ! ’ officials at @entity8 appeared not to approve of the man ’s bid for love and deleted his post , replacing it with a limerick instead			0
backlash : ' @entity90 ' was hit with more than 400 replies within minutes , attacking him for his request it read : ‘ there once came from @entity63 this guy , who gave the @entity98 the eye			1
they were n’t all that keen , ‘ cos he was n’t @entity103 , and the size of his knob was a lie			0
’ in a tweet they added : ‘ here ’s what happens when you look for @entity32 fun on @entity8			1
’ in october last year , a post on the website went viral after a woman asked fellow mothers if their partners ‘ dunked ’ their penis into a beaker of water left by the bedside table after having sex			2
‘ we have a dedicated post-sex cleanup area on the bedside table , ’ she wrote			0
‘ a box of tissues , a small bin , and a beaker of clean water for temporary cleaning / dunking while the bathroom is occupied by me			0
‘ apparently our penis beaker is strange and not the done thing			0
” another mum quickly replied : ‘ no. we have a normal bedside table			0
with books and a lamp			0
not a sex clean - up bit ! ’ the post quickly became a popular discussion on social media sites such as @entity37 , with people expressing their amusement using the hashtag # penisbeaker .			2
