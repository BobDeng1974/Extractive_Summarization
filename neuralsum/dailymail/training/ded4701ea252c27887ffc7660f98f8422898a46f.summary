@entity0 came to the oil - and - rags track at @entity2 via the glitziest address in @entity4 ahead of sunday ’s @entity7 , the @entity6 driver recalled meeting president @entity8 and told how @entity9 had to wait in the queue while the leader of the free world lingered to talk about @entity13 with him			1
but after the summer break , part of which @entity0 ’s @entity20 team - mate and only title rival @entity18 spent hunting for the best pizza in @entity22 , there is a growing sense that the intensity of the world championship fight is heightening			1
welcome break : @entity0 ( left ) has returned from the @entity13 holiday ready to race at spa preparation : @entity20 driver @entity0 met with @entity31 president @entity8 in the build - up to the race favoured : @entity8 kept talking to @entity0 about @entity13 , leaving singing legend @entity9 waiting in the queue rivalry : @entity0 and @entity20 team - mate @entity18 ( left ) are in direct competition for the title the niggle is sharper			1
the barbs carry more weight			0
‘ i am not hiding anything from @entity18 , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he has all my data			0
i never , never ever have asked my guys , “ do n’t show that to @entity18			1
” actually i want him to be at his best , because it is more painful when you are at your best and getting beaten			0
’ @entity0 first has to overhaul @entity18 ’s 11 - point lead before worrying about rubbing the @entity51 ’s nose in the gravel trap			1
this weekend presents an opportunity for each of the title combatants to prove his worth			2
spa is a true racer ’s track			2
at 4.3 miles , it is the longest of the year , a rollercoaster of high - speed straights and fast corners hidden among the high trees of the @entity66 forest			1
its glory is the plunge - and - climb corner , @entity69			2
the new twitchier cars of 2014 will be a handful through there , so much so that @entity73 , the veteran @entity74 driver , admitted he ‘ let out a few screams inside my crash helmet ’ during practice on friday			2
at the head of the time sheets were the @entity20 duo , predictably			1
@entity0 set the fastest time of the day , with @entity18 six - tenths of a second tardier			1
determined : @entity0 is hoping to life his second world title this season but he is second in the championship competition : @entity18 leads the drivers ' championship by 11 points heading into the @entity92 @entity7 hunger : @entity51 driver @entity18 spent the @entity13 break travelling around @entity95 finding the perfect pizza ‘ it stayed dry throughout both sessions but the forecast is wet for qualifying tomorrow , so it was important to maximise track time as this may be our last dry running before the race , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ we ’ve seen rain so often here in the past and that can really mix things up — particularly when it ’s wet in places and dry in others			0
‘ i want to keep my head down like a bull — nothing can really stand in the way of a bull			0
but my team - mate wants to be the wall that gets in the way , so i will try to manoeuvre it the best way i can this weekend , and win			1
’ it felt as though @entity124 was back in control			0
in fact , the sport ’s supremo had hardly been away , but merely distracted by his bribery trial in @entity51			0
he paid £ 60million and the case was dropped , with no implication of guilt in official wording of the court			0
he was in typically feisty form here during a series of interviews			0
on the inaugural @entity139 @entity7 planned for october 12 , he told the @entity140 : ‘ i asked somebody the other day , “ have they decided who shot that plane down ? ” nobody seems to know , do they ? so what ’s the link ? cool : @entity0 has water tipped over his head as he takes part in the @entity152 at @entity2 dark skies : @entity18 drivers around the @entity2 during practice at the @entity92 @entity7 on friday focused : @entity0 is determined to take back some initiative in the title race by winning the @entity92 @entity7 ‘ in @entity160 , for example , we have sent guns and things to people that have been used , and we ’re responsible ? does n’t sound right does it ? ’ two @entity166 , of @entity167 , and @entity168 , who is destined to race for @entity170 next year aged 17 - also left their marks on the day			1
as of thursday night @entity172 , a @entity6 racer who pays for his drive , was due to step aside for this race			2
it appeared his funding had got clogged up			0
yet , mysteriously , he was reinstated on friday morning			2
why the u-turn ? ‘ i ca n’t tell you , ’ was the gist of @entity180 ’s non-explanation , ‘ but it ’s not what you think			0
’ so what did we think it was , we asked ? ‘ i ’m not saying , ’ he said			0
how absurd can you get ? as for @entity168 , the son of the former @entity188 f1 driver @entity187 , he was unflappable when he appeared in front of the media for the first time			0
he revealed that he has not completed his schooling yet and will fit lessons and exams around his racing schedule			0
‘ excuse me , sir , ’ one imagined he might say come next may , ‘ but can i leave class early - i ’ve got to race in the @entity198 ? ’ new kid on the block : 16 - year - old @entity201 appeared in front of the media for the first time on friday			1
