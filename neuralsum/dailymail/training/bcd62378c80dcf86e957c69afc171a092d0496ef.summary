by @entity0 published : 19:29 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 03:41 est , 10 january 2013 the elderly should be encouraged to sacrifice part of their pension lump sum or to downsize their home to pay for their care , two @entity2 ministers said yesterday			1
@entity8 , the @entity9 , said people could enter into deals under which they receive a smaller payout on retirement			1
the rest would go towards an insurance scheme to cover their needs in old age , such as care home fees and home help costs			1
' sensitive territory ' : @entity2 ministers put forward the suggestions as a means of helping to fund the cost of care homes and home help ( file photo ) @entity28 , the @entity29 , suggested that the elderly could free up cash by moving into smaller homes			1
the comments , made to a @entity35 inquiry into the effect of demographic change on public services , are likely to infuriate pensioners ’ groups who say it is unfair that those who have paid taxes all their lives should not be guaranteed a decent income in old age			1
they come amid continued confusion over the future of elderly care funding			1
ministers have accepted the principle of a cap on the amount someone would be expected to pay , as recommended by economist @entity56			1
but they are yet to say the level at which the ceiling will be set			2
mr @entity56 suggested a figure of around £ 35,000			0
there are rumours the government may set a figure of £ 75,000			0
mr @entity8 told the committee that during talks with mr @entity56 he had been told that the presence of a cap would give financial services companies the certainty to come forward with insurance products to reduce the cost still further			0
these could also fund ‘ top - up ’ care , where people would be able to live in better quality care homes than their council will fund			1
of his proposal , mr @entity28 said : ‘ i certainly think there is a lot more could be done on trading down , although this is incredibly sensitive territory			0
’ mr @entity28 told the committee that , with life expectancy rates rising , the era of people retiring in their late 50s was over			0
confusion : @entity88 ' groups say people who have paid taxes all their lives should be guaranteed a decent income in their old age last night @entity93 , director general of over- @entity94 , said : ‘ for a lot of people , their home is not just an asset – it is part of the family			1
and t hey want to pass it on to their children			0
for these people , trading down is not an option			0
’ @entity103 plans to slash winter fuel payments to pensioners living abroad			2
the @entity106 is considering imposing a ‘ temperature test ’ that would see expatriate pensioners in countries with warmer average winter temperatures lose part – or all – of the cash			2
last year , the taxpayer funded payments of £ 12.8million to 74,685 expats in countries such as @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120			0
figures obtained by the @entity122 show that the cost has risen 13-fold in the past decade			0
the money has to be paid because @entity126 directives say national governments must do nothing to stop freedom of movement in the community , or to discriminate on grounds of age			0
a source said : ‘ clearly it is crazy that pensioners living in hot places in @entity138 should be receiving winter fuel payments			2

ministers said @entity88 should be encouraged to accept smaller pension payouts or move into smaller homes to help pay for their care
comments , which come amid *ongoing* confusion over the future of elderly care funding , are likely to infuriate pensioners ' groups
