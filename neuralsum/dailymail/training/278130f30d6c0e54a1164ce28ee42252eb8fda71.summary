by @entity0 on sunday ’s season premiere of @entity3 , @entity1 is told by wife @entity4 : ‘ do n’t rip the ads out of my magazines			1
’ the show , which has become known for its strict historical accuracy , used a february 1969 issue of @entity10 as a prop , and now the iconic title has released images of the actual ads @entity15 might have wanted to keep			1
the issue featured ads for @entity19 cars , @entity21 beer and rise shaving lotion , as well as placements for cigarette companies @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			2
@entity10 experienced its heyday in the 1960s for its famous centerfolds and intellectual articles @entity15 and @entity4 have a discussion in their @entity34 kitchen in the season seven premiere of @entity3 , just before @entity15 was instructed not to rip ads from her magazines @entity26 's cigarette ad echoes a time when tobacco products were not heavily regulated by the government perhaps most pivotally , the ads express many of @entity15 ’s vices that have so vividly been played out by actor @entity45 over the show ’s last seven seasons			1
a heavy smoker , whose early run in the show was shaped by his copywriting work for @entity53 , @entity15 would have been both personally and professionally intrigued by the many cigarette ads that filled @entity10 ’s pages			1
the tobacco ads ’ lack of @entity59 warnings and advisories may create a visual shock for the modern consumer			0
in fact cigarette companies at the time actually used medical findings to their advantage			0
@entity26 's ad , for example , claims that its cigarettes are ‘ now lower in “ tar ” than the best - selling filter king ! who says so ? the latest @entity73 figures			0
’ another one of @entity15 ’s favorite substances , alcohol , presents itself in full - force throughout @entity10 ’s advertising			1
@entity21 beer , the preferred cheap beer of mid-century @entity81 - rs , uses a classic advertising approach in its 1969 campaign @entity85 's sports jackets advocate their innovations in synthetic materials ( a growing sector at the time ) and also promote their now laughably modest price of $ 65 placements for @entity93 vermouth and @entity95 bourbon position themselves as viable candidates for inclusion on @entity15 ’s consistently - stocked office bar cart			2
while it appears that @entity15 is currently taking a rest from drinking , as it was the primary reason for his suspension from work , previews for this week ’s episode depict his reoccurring difficulty with managing his alcoholism			2
@entity15 also has a penchant for fast , sleek cars			0
the @entity112 ad depicting a @entity113 couple in matching wasp attire would have no doubt piqued his interest			0
however , he may have personally disagreed with @entity112 ’s tagline : ‘ if you have n’t got a past yet … get a @entity119 1			0
’ @entity25 's @entity10 spot is unlike today 's cigarette ads for its complete lack of medical warnings and advisories @entity112 looks to appeal to an upper - middle - class consumer with its @entity127 ad that is equal parts aspirational and attainable considering that @entity15 has an extensive past , which includes his original identity as @entity132 , it ’s likely that he would have rolled his eyes at this line aimed at those who are more naïve			1
the luxury products in @entity10 ’s glossy pages would have been published at the tail end of the @entity139 ’ economic prosperity , which would soon wind down in the following decade when an oil crisis , exceeding inflation , and declining manufacturing rates would hit the @entity144 in 1969 , the @entity144 was also in the midst of the @entity146			1
the ads published in @entity10 exhibit how those @entity148 were often disconnected from the troops battling in horrific conditions many miles away			2
rise shaving lotion 's ad evokes the @entity139 ' feminine ideals of big hair , doe - eyes , and a baby face @entity158 's approach to advertising is incredibly straightforward , while also utilizing the long - form style of copy that was so popular in the pre-internet era @entity164 's advertisement speaks to the hardships of the @entity146 , still in full thrall in 1969 @entity3 ’s seventh and final season debuted on april 13			1
the season has been split into two parts , with the first seven episodes running through the end of may , and the remainder airing next year			0
the emmy - award winning show first premiered in 2007			0
antique bourbon 's hedonistic imagery perhaps aims to rope in a more rambunctious type of consumer cigarettes , this time a brand called sail from @entity182 , looks to draw consumers by providing them with incentive to try the foreign brand			0

in the @entity3 final season premiere @entity187 instructs @entity15 not to rip ads out of her february 1969 issue of @entity10
@entity10 has now released the ads that @entity15 would have seen in in the issue
the ads speak to @entity15 's many vices , as well as the *social* *climate* of the late @entity139
