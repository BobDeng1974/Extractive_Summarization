alcohol can turn the quietest of people into exhibitionists , who , with the help of a karaoke machine can belt out hits such as ‘ i will survive ’ at the top of their lungs while slurring the words			0
now , scientists have discovered that alcohol has a similar effect on birds , whose songs become slurred and less well defined when they are under the influence			1
the birds were given spiked juice and their songs carefully analysed for the tell - tale hallmarks of drunkenness			1
the @entity21 , or anything by wings : scientists gave zebra finches ( stock image ) juice spiked with alcohol and analysed the effect on their songs , to find that they were slurred and quieter than usual @entity30 , of @entity31 described an experiment where zebra finches were given juice with six per cent alcohol , on @entity38 ’s @entity37 show			1
they wanted to explore whether alcohol affects the songs of birds in the same way it does humans			1
@entity46 finches are commonly used to model human vocal learning and unravel how people communicate			1
dr @entity49 told broadcaster @entity50 : ' at first we were thinking that they would n't drink on their own because , you know , a lot of animals just wo n't touch the stuff			0
but they seem to tolerate it pretty well and be somewhat willing to consume it			0
’ the unusual experiment set out to find out whether alcohol affects the songs of birds in the same way it does humans			1
a stock image of people in a karaoke bar is pictured the birds had blood alcohol levels of between 0.05 and 0.08 per cent , which may not sound a lot , but produced the effects of drunkenness , because of the way that birds metabolise alcohol			0
birds could feasibly become ' drunk ' in the wild , if they eat a lot of fermenting berries			0
in the experiment , the scientists observed that the songs of the birds got quieter and became a little slurred , under the influence of the spiked juice			1
dr @entity49 said : ‘ [ they became ] ‘ a bit less organised in their sound production , ’ in the same way that humans slur their words and songs in a distinctive way			1
in the future , he plans on exploring whether alcohol not only alters the way birds sing , but if it alters the way they learn new tunes too			0
the hermit thrush may well be the @entity98 of the bird world thanks to its tuneful melodies , a study revealed last month			0
scientists have discovered that the @entity103 songbird sings in ' harmonic series ' , a pattern of pleasing - sounding notes commonly used in popular human music			2
by studying how birds sing , experts hope to learn how much of human musical heritage is shaped by biology , compared to culture			0
a harmonic series stems from a base note and is followed by notes that increase in pitch , based on multiples of the original note			0
scientists have discovered that the hermit thrush ( stock image ) sings in ' harmonic series ' , a pattern of pleasing - sounding notes commonly used in popular human music scientists found that around 70 per cent of the bird ’s songs followed this pattern , @entity126 reported			1
male hermit thrushes sing between six and 10 types of song , which tend to be high - pitched and fast , beginning with a long whistle , the study revealed			0
@entity135 , a composer at @entity136 in @entity137 and @entity138 , a biologist at the @entity139 , analysed 144 different song types from 14 male hermit thrushes			2
‘ listening to the songs full speed , they are very attractive , but we did n’t have any inkling that we would hear the harmonic series in them , ' dr @entity135 said			2
but after they slowed them down , the harmonic series patterns became clear and statisticians analysed the bird ’s choices of pitch in the song			2
around 70 per cent of the songs analysed followed harmonic intervals , compared to just five per cent which seemed to include random notes			1
dr @entity135 emphasised that the birds do n’t deliberately compose their songs using scales , but noted that other birds also like intervals used in human music			2
for example , previous studies have shown that musical wrens use them and domestic chickens favour consonant notes – a combination of notes that sound pleasant when played at the same time .			0

scientists from the @entity31 gave zebra finches alcoholic juice and analysed the effect on their singing
they found songs were slurred , quieter and ' less organised '
scientists found that effect is similar to that in humans , who also slur
