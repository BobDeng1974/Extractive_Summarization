@entity0 could face a battle to retain a string of their most highly - rated young players in 2015			2
the contracts of six stars - @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 - are due to expire at the end of the season			1
all five players are , in theory , free to talk to foreign clubs from january 1 and sign a pre-contract agreement for next season , meaning that there is a danger that @entity0 could lose them for nothing come the end of the season			1
@entity7 's contract at @entity0 will expire at the end of the season @entity7 and @entity8 have both impressed following injuries to @entity0 ’s senior defenders in the first half of the season			1
they were particularly impressive in the 2 - 1 victory at @entity29			0
united executives are understood to have held discussions over new a new deal for @entity7 although a contract is yet to be finalised			0
it is unlikely that these youngsters would choose to leave @entity42 - such has been @entity37 ’s inclination to present them with opportunities - but it still seems curious that @entity0 have been sluggish in arranging extensions			0
young defenders @entity7 and @entity8 ( right ) have impressed after being thrown in at the deep end @entity0 fans will still remember , for example , how @entity47 was allowed to leave the club on a free to @entity49 in 2012			1
the one who may appear most likely to move on is 18 - year - old @entity11 , with sources in @entity52 suggesting that he may be tempted to look for regular football elsewhere			0
@entity54 , meanwhile , is likely to leave the club on loan in january			0
@entity47 was allowed to leave @entity0 on a free contract to @entity58 club @entity49 two years ago @entity59 is likely to leave the club on loan in january having struggled for game time this season			2

five young @entity0 players are out of contract at end of season
@entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 free to talk to foreign clubs from january 1
@entity70 could be a target for leading @entity73 clubs
