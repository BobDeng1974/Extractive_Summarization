a power cut could have prevented a shark spotter from sounding a warning alarm just before a @entity5 swimmer was savaged by a great white off the coast of @entity8 in @entity9 , it has been claimed			1
a shark spotter is thought to have seen 43 - year - old @entity12 enter the water and attempted to warn him of danger - but the siren did n't work because of a city - wide power cut , it has been reported			1
according to @entity9 's @entity21 website , an official incident report from the @entity19 claimed there was an electricity failure with the power company @entity24			0
in shock : @entity12 in the water seconds after the attack by a 10ft great white shark off a beach in @entity8 dragged to safety : mr @entity12 is pulled ashore while the shark is still circling nearby alive - but only just : mr @entity12 leaves a trail of blood as anxious rescuers pull him from the sea the report said : ' at around 12.25pm ( on wednesday ) , the mountain shark spotter saw a swimmer enter the water near the @entity41 area			1
regular swimmer : @entity12 , 42 , is an accountant who previously lived in @entity43 , west @entity44 , before moving to @entity9 ' the spotter tried to sound the alarm , but due to an @entity24 - related city - wide electricity failure , the alarm did not sound			1
' @entity24 were unable to comment as the company said it was unaware of the @entity19 's incident report			0
an @entity24 spokeswoman confirmed a power cut lasted for two hours , starting from just before 11am to shortly after 1pm			1
it was apparently caused by a trip on the power line supplying @entity8			0
however , they were unable to comment on the possible impact this had on the shark alarm as they unaware of the authority 's incident report			0
meanwhile a seal has emerged as an unlikely saviour by apparently helping @entity12 as he was attacked by the shark			1
two men who dragged mr @entity12 to shore described how the creature swam around them as if to distract the 12ft @entity70 , which appeared to be preparing for a second strike			1
mr @entity12 , who lost his right leg and part of his left foot , yesterday remained in a critical condition in hospital			1
back ashore : mr @entity12 is dragged on to @entity78 immediately following last wednesday 's attack is this the culprit ? this image of a @entity70 was taken close to where mr @entity12 was attacked			2
it was taken by shark spotters monitoring the area this week creating a diversion : a seal was on the scene as mr @entity12 was pulled from the water surgeons paid tribute to the remarkable first - aid treatment he received when a shark - spotter tied his belt and wetsuit shorts around the 42 - year - old ’s injured legs as improvised tourniquets – stopping him from bleeding to death			1
mr @entity12 , an accountant , had ignored warnings of a shark in the area before taking to the water off @entity105 beach			1
yesterday , passers - by @entity107 and @entity108 told how they ran into the blood - clouded surf to help pull the stricken swimmer to safety after watching the attack			0
the pair modestly played down their own heroics , but highlighted the surprising role of the seal			0
‘ as @entity119 and i were pulling him in towards the shore , the seal frolicked nearby , and kept swimming past us , it seemed rather agitated			0
‘ it occurred to us afterwards how unusual it was for a seal to stick around in an area where a shark is , or where there is blood			2
‘ it really did feel to us as though he was offering support to us , or the swimmer , and was prepared to act as a diversion if the shark went after us as well , ’ mr @entity107 said			0
the 66 - year - old was in the area with his friend mr @entity138 , 61 , trying to spot whales when they saw the shark looming towards mr @entity12 , who was swimming a few yards from the beach			1
they stopped their car and ran to shout warnings , but it was too late , leaving them to watch helplessly as he was pulled under			2
beach rescue : medics treat @entity12 's injuries , using makeshift tourniquets to stem the blood flow from his legs drama : members of the @entity105 emergency services stretcher mr @entity12 from the beach to a helicopter airlift : mr @entity12 is taken to hospital in @entity8 where he was expected to undergo around six hours of surgery even though the shark remained in the area , possibly preparing for a second strike , the two men plunged into the water to help in the efforts to drag mr @entity12 to safety			1
professor @entity169 , who operated on the swimmer , said he had needed seven litres of blood on arriving at hospital			0
he had fought to save one of the @entity175 ’s legs , even though it was badly bitten , because he had lost the other leg			0
mr @entity12 ’s femoral artery and vein were both torn – usually a fatal injury – and professor @entity181 praised the life - saving first - aid efforts by a member of the beach ’s shark - spotting team			1
‘ the tourniquet resulted in the almost complete stopping of blood loss from the thigh and i just want to commend the people giving first aid on the beach for saving the life of this patient , ’ he said			1
‘ self - made improvised tourniquets do n’t tend to work and are frowned on in medical literature , but this really was life - saving			2
if the femoral artery and vein are both severed you do n’t tend to make it into hospital alive			0
’ he said the parents of mr @entity12 , who is single , had been by his bedside			0
‘ they are extremely traumatised by what ’s happened and realise the seriousness of his condition			0
’ the @entity209 - born accountant , who has a @entity5 passport and lived in @entity44 before moving to @entity9 , had taken to the water even though the beach was closed after shark sightings			1
he was said to be a regular swimmer at the beach , who had previously ignored warnings to stay out of the water			2
the site of the attack is close to one of the highest populations of @entity223 in the world , and has seen a number of deaths and injuries to swimmers and surfers			0
last night , experts said the seal had been nearby			0
@entity232 , of the @entity233 , said : ‘ a shark remained close to the scene throughout medical efforts to save the victim , and it has been confirmed that a seal was swimming close by during the entire episode			2
‘ witnesses confirmed the seal circled the men as they gradually waded ashore with the victim in the presence of a shark			2
