by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 thinks @entity3 , who branded the current @entity5 side the worst he had seen in 20 years , will be eating a large portion of humble pie come the end of the season			1
@entity3 laid into @entity5 following their 2 - 1 defeat to @entity11 on the opening day of the season			1
the former @entity15 and @entity16 man , who was a pundit for @entity17 at @entity18 this weekend , claimed @entity19 possesses the worst @entity5 squad he had ever seen in two decades			1
and the @entity5 vice-captain thinks the former @entity37 international will be eating his words at the end of may			1
' people have been waiting for an opportunity to have a go at @entity5 for years and this is the perfect time ( to do it ) , ' the @entity5 midfielder said			1
' it 's a long season and i do n't think they will be saying those things at the end of it			2
' i believe we 're going to have a very good season			1
' all the players believe that too			0
' comments like that give us a greater determination , without a shadow of a doubt			2
' new team : @entity59 , left , has been appointed as @entity19 's assistant since the @entity61 took over having been part of the @entity5 team that finished seventh last year , @entity2 knows how it feels to be on the receiving end of some scathing criticism			1
the midfielder may have just been 11 - years - old at the time , but he also remembers when former @entity69 pundit @entity68 told sir @entity70 ' you ca n't win anything with kids ' in 1995			2
@entity70 won the league that year and scooped a further 10 titles after building a team around a group of youth players from the famed ' class of ' 92 '			0
@entity2 thinks @entity81 's squad has a similar look to it as the one that contained the likes of @entity86 , @entity87 and a young @entity59 just over a decade ago			1
belief in youth : @entity81 is giving young players at the club a chance to impress , including @entity92 , left ' to be honest it felt like that in the dressing room today , ' said @entity2 , who played alongside debutants @entity92 and @entity97 on saturday			1
' it did have a feel of that in terms of people looking at the squad and maybe not seeing household names , but these players are good enough and the manager believes in them			1
' all you need is a platform to go and perform and i 'm sure they 'll definitely go and prove people wrong			2
' this whole club is about bouncing back from adversity			0
' @entity81 has lost experienced heads like @entity59 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 from his playing squad this summer			0
but @entity2 thinks the players that remain are strong enough personalities to fill the void			2
he said : ' people talk about the players that have left but i see it in the eyes of the young players , they 're ready for it and determined to show people how good they are and we 're determined to show people how good the team are			2
' you have to be a big character to play for this club			0
' back on track : @entity136 scored an acrobatic equaliser for @entity5 but it was not enough to gain a point @entity136 equalised for @entity5 following @entity141 's opener with an overhead kick from short - range			1
but the striker 's first outing as captain ended up being one to forget thanks to @entity149 's 72nd minute winner			0
@entity136 admitted it was a far from ideal way to start the season , but the striker trusts @entity81 to pick the team up in the coming days			0
' this is a really bad result for us , but we will learn , especially with the manager we have got , ' @entity136 said			0
' he is strong and he wants 100 per cent every game			0
' we know last season was a disaster			0
it was n't good enough and we were ready for the start of this season			2
' maybe after a good pre-season we were a bit over confident			0
' but we just have to look at the bad points and cut them out			0
if we do that we will win games			0
' match - winner : @entity11 midfielder @entity149 scored the decisive goal in the second half at @entity18 @entity149 , meanwhile , could not think of a better place to score on his second debut for @entity11			1
' getting three points at @entity18 is always special , but to score the winner here has been a dream for me ever since i was young , ' said @entity149 who returned to @entity11 this summer following a two - year spell at @entity181			1
' it is one of the biggest stadiums in the world			0
