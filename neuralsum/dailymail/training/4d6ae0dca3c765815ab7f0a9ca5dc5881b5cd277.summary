@entity1 president @entity0 delivers remarks about the launch of the @entity6 's health insurance marketplaces as many as 11 million employees of small businesses in the @entity1 face paying more for health insurance under @entity6 , according to a new report into the controversial healthcare bill			1
the estimate , provided by the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) , part of the @entity15 , also projected that 6 million others face lower rates for health insurance			1
the report says that this is due to the to the laws requirement that premiums for health insurance can no longer be based on an insurance applicant 's age			1
this means that while older people 's premiums are going down , younger people 's are going to rise			1
while the estimate is far from certain , because many small businesses renewed their insurance policies in 2013			1
because they renewed before 2014 , they were allowed to avoid higher premiums that went into effect , when insurance coverage was required to conform to the new law , on january 1			1
the estimate is also affected by the report only looking at three specific provisions of the @entity6			2
in actuality , employers decisions will be based on more than just three factors , according to information from the @entity13			2
the news that premiums could increase for 11 million could be good news for the @entity47 , who have made anti-obamacare campaigning their number one priority and policy			1
@entity6 has been rife with problems ever since it was signed into law in march 2010			2
a typical @entity1 insurance site , that allows citizens to sign up for medical and health insurance			0
under @entity6 , the rules that exist to help them sign up are different in a way that tries to benefit those on lower incomes public polls suggest that the @entity1 citizenship generally support @entity6 , but recent and frequent damaging mistakes and errors in its implementation have given the @entity47 , who strongly oppose the legislation , ammo against it in their campaigns			0
recently , errors in signing up to @entity6 using the website was fraught with error , as the site appeared to be repeatedly broken , prompting people to have to use the mobile site if they wanted to sign up			0
this , combined with low turnout for signing up in states such as @entity83 , which signed up only 33 , 808 instead of a projected 146,940 , has given the public pause for thought when decided where their allegiances lie			0
however , despite these mistakes , many governors , both @entity47 and @entity89 alike , have come to the conclusion that ' @entity6 is here to stay ' taking a more ' pragmatic view ' of the healthcare legislation			0
' we 're just trying to make the best of a bad situation ' said @entity97 gov. @entity97 of @entity98 , who called the health care law ' unaffordable and unsustainable '			0
representative @entity100 , a @entity47 from @entity101 , displays an advertisement from the thanks @entity6 campaign , an anti-obamacare campaign			0
@entity47 have been widely critical of the new healthcare legislation he said : ' we 're trying to make it work as best we can for the people of @entity98			0
' governor @entity108 of @entity109 said : ' i do n't think that it 's so deeply entrenched that it ca n't be repealed			1
' ' but i do think , as we argue for repeal , we have to show folks what you replace it with			0
' however , despite a troubled introduction , nearly 3.3 million people have signed up by february 1 for health care coverage under the law			2
in addition , the @entity123 reported that 1 million people signed up nationwide for private insurance under the law in january alone			1
but it still remains unclear whether the administration will reach its unofficial goal of 7 million people by the end of march			2
' @entity6 ' is the name given to the @entity132 and @entity133 , legislation that is an attempt to make healthcare in the @entity1 , which can often be very expensive , affordable for those on lower incomes			0
healthcare in the @entity1 is based around the purchase of health insurance , which , before now , was able to make it expensive for people , or even deny people their services on the basis of factors like age or pre-existing medical conditions			1
without medical insurance , citizens in the @entity1 have to pay for their own medical care which can be incredibly expensive ( a single hospital visit can cost $ 1,265 )			2
a few basic rules under the act are :			0

11 million small business employees could pay more , 6 million pay less
it wo n't affect people until next year , businesses renewed at end of 2013
disparity due to law saying insurance premiums ca n't be based on age
older people will likely pay less and younger people will likely pay more
