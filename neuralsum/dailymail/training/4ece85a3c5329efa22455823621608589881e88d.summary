a new video has given a unique insight into why men feel they have a right to harass women in the street			1
in the short documentary , which was created by @entity7 in response to a recently - released video which documented a woman being harassed as she walked through @entity11 , a number of men and women are questioned about their thoughts on cat - calling , and asked for their opinions on why so many men are guilty of the sexist practice			1
while a number of the women interviewed explain how upsetting they find it , most of the men admit that they ca n't understand why anyone would view catcalling as offensive - with one going as far as to claim that commenting on women in the street is his ' right '			1
' i whistle , i do the suck			0
do you understand what i 'm saying ? if you have a beautiful body , why ca n't i say something ? ' a few of the men try to claim that women are to blame for any harassment or abuse that they receive - particularly if they choose to wear tight - fitting or provocative clothing			1
' it 's my point of view , ' one teenage boy explains			2
' when a girl comes out , in in public , with tight leggings and you can see something like that ... i 'm saying something			0
' another adds : ' if you do not like guys to try and track you then try not to wear tight clothes , ' while a third man suggests : ' if she 's uncomfortable , that might be her own personal issue			0
' ' this man came out of nowhere and grabbed her ' : during one of the interviews , a man approached this young girl and put his arm around her before the interviewer sent him away ' do n't wear tight clothes ' : all of these young teenagers admit to harassing women in the street , with the young man on the left suggesting provocative clothing was to blame for their behavior ironically , as one of the women in the video points out , many of the men who are guilty of harassing women in the street admit that they would be furious to see the same thing being done to their own female friends and family members			2
' if you think about it , yeah , you 're still doing that to somebody else 's sister or mother and that 's wrong , ' one confesses			0
while all the available evidence suggests that catcalling rarely - if ever - leads to any kind of positive social interaction , @entity101 , deputy director of the advocacy group @entity103 , told @entity7 that many men just do n't understand the negative message that they are sending to women by yelling out at them in the street			1
' i 've seen , you know , the light bulb go off in someone 's mind , ' she said of @entity103 's efforts to educate young men about street harassment			2
' it 's not effective , ' she said			0
' according to all the stories we 've read and people we 've spoken to , it does not work			0

the video shows a group of @entity11 being interviewed about catcalling
many of the men claim it is their right to comment on a woman 's appearance , even if she is a total *stranger*
