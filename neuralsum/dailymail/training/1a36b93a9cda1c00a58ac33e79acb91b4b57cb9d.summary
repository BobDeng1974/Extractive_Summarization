the survey and focus group was conducted on behalf of organic skincare brand , @entity40 , which is also participating in the government - led campaign to encourage women to feel better about the way they look and conducting an @entity47 campaign of its own			1
' as a 37 year old woman , i resent being told my days of looking and feeling my best are numbered , and that i should trolley - dash my way around my local beauty hall to " save " myself from lines and wrinkles , ' said @entity56 founder , @entity55			0
