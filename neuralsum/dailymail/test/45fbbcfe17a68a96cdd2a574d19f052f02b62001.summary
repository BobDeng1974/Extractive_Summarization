do n't expect to snag a £ 1,000 nosebleed ticket - or any other ticket - at the box office for the fight between @entity3 and @entity4			1
just two weeks before the bout , tickets for the most anticipated fight in recent times have yet to go on public sale , with the two camps and the @entity12 locked in a stand - off over allotments			1
when they are finally put on sale , only a few will be sold at the listed price			1
the impasse has left fans in the dark , and ticket brokers perplexed			2
@entity3 performs at a media workout with his uncle @entity23 on the pads in @entity25 @entity4 was in good spirits as he showed off his skills for the fans earlier this week ' it 's bizarre , normally there 's a public sale 10 weeks before the fight , ' said @entity32 , an analyst for @entity33			1
' to our knowledge no one has a printed ticket in their hands right now			0
' @entity3 's promoter , @entity40 , said tuesday that tickets would go on sale this week for the may 2 fight , but @entity45 officials have been tight - lipped about their availability			1
the hotel issued a statement friday saying there would be a ' limited number of tickets available for sale ' and that it is working with promoters to finalize a date for their release			2
the fight was always going to be a tough ticket , with announced prices of £ 1,000 to £ 5,000 in the 16,500 - seat @entity62 arena			2
but those prices have already tripled in the resale market even before tickets are available , and the two camps and the @entity45 have been bickering over how many seats - and at what price level - each party gets			1
@entity4 's manager , @entity70 , blamed the @entity3 camp for holding up the ticket sales , saying they have refused to sign a term sheet negotiated months earlier that specified the allotments			1
' it 's a real mess right now , ' @entity70 said			0
' i can only surmise the motivation is greed and an attempt to manipulate the tickets , otherwise why the holdup ? i 'm more than a little upset they 're not for sale to the public			2
' millions of dollars are at stake in the dispute , because after the @entity45 takes its share each camp gets a certain percentage of tickets and is able to resell them with ticket brokers for higher prices			0
the estimated gate for the tickets if they are sold at retail prices is already a staggering £ 48million , far surpassing the previous gate record of £ 13.3million for @entity3 's 2013 fight with @entity101			1
@entity4 used @entity102 to show his fans a photo of his ripped body as he continues his preparation promoter @entity107 said he has heard of people cancelling their reservations to @entity25 because they 're afraid they ca n't get tickets			1
' this is not acceptable , ' said @entity107 , who promotes @entity4			0
' this is a worldwide event that the city of @entity25 is involved in			0
it 's one of the craziest things i 've ever seen			0
' @entity32 said the fight is one of @entity120 's most searched events , but that only a few dozen tickets have been sold through the website			2
those tickets are what the ticket industry calls ' spec tickets ' because the sellers do n't actually have them in hand , but expect to get them before the fight			0
the @entity131 fighter is looking to put an end to @entity3 's current unbeaten record in the ring the cheapest seat on the site on friday was £ 3,200 , and @entity32 said the average sale so far is in the £ 5,300 range			1
' people are hesitant to buy in the secondary market before there 's been an original sale , ' he said			0
' and you 've also got the incredible prices being asked for tickets now			0
that means a lot of people are not buying tickets at this point			0
' at @entity152 there are no tickets for sale , spokeswoman @entity155 said , because the ticket reseller is waiting for actual prices to be set and tickets to be printed			2
music artist @entity159 posted the photo of ' @entity161 ' with just over two weeks to go until the bout ' there 's still so much up in the air for this fight that we 're not allowing spec sales , ' @entity155 said			0
' we 're not willing to take that risk now			0
' tickets have also not gone on sale for the closed circuit telecast of the fight at the various @entity45 properties in @entity25			2
thousands of those tickets are expected to be sold to fans that ca n't get into the arena itself , but no price has been set for them			1
@entity4 shows off his impressive speed - which he will hope will trouble @entity3 earning an estimated $ 180million from the bout , @entity3 is confident he wo n't lose his perfect record @entity70 said he talked to @entity4 on thursday about making sure he had enough tickets to take care of people in his camp			1
he said there have been requests from around the world for fight tickets , but that they have been forced to put them off because of the uncertainty over how many tickets are available and their pricing			1
one thing that is certain , he said , is no one - including the celebrities who generally populate the ringside seats - is getting in for free			0
' nobody 's getting free tickets , ' @entity70 said			0
' even @entity107 ( @entity107 ) has to pay for his ticket in the first row			0
' @entity3 and @entity4 pose during a press conference ahead of their mega-fight in @entity25			1
