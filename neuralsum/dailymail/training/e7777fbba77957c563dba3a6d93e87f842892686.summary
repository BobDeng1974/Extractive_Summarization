@entity1 's budgie smugglers are ' confronting ' - but we 're not calling for them to be banned			1
that is the common refrain of the @entity5 community to fierce calls for the burqa to be outlawed			1

' it 's a light hearted way of making the point ...			2

it is very rare in @entity52			1
information courtesy of @entity10 the burqa debate - fuelled by conservative senators ' calls and prime minister @entity1 's comment he finds the face - covering ' confronting ' and ' wishes it was not worn ' - has frustrated the country 's @entity77 community , who say only a tiny minority of women wear the full face covering anyway			1
for a brief moment on thursday , there was even a plan to keep @entity77 visitors who wanted to watch proceedings at @entity89 in a glass enclosure			1
the plan was quashed late last night by prime minister @entity1 , following community uproar and backlash from members of his own party			1
@entity5 community leaders told @entity23 they are sick of the burqa ( a form of dress where the face is covered by a mesh grill ) being confused with the niqab , a more popular dress where the face is covered but the eyes are not			1
' it ( the burqa ) is not common , ' ms @entity10 said			2
and while there are no reliable statistics , ' only a tiny minority ' of @entity77 women wear the niqab , she said			1

' it 's an amazing feeling of freedom , ' said @entity36 , the executive officer of the @entity117			2
' you can see clearly , but no one can see you			0
' ms @entity36 chose to start wearing a hijab 30 years ago , but she has worn a niqab while spending time overseas			2
she said her headscarf reminds her of her spirituality			0
' for me it 's a reminder of my own purpose in this life and how to be the best that i can be , ' she told @entity23			2
@entity127 , who sells @entity5 clothing to women at a store in @entity131 , in south - west @entity13 , agreed that the handful of people she knows who wear the niqab found the experience rewarding			2
' they 're not perceived as oppressed - they feel liberated , ' she told @entity23			0
the furious debate is occurring at a time of celebration for many @entity11			1
the @entity142 , one of the most important dates in the religious calendar , will be held over the long weekend , concurrent with the @entity147 pilgrimage to @entity148			0
