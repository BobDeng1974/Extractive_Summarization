there was a time when the name of @entity3 would be one to avoid in the semi-final of @entity6 competition			1
those days are long gone			0
when @entity8 of @entity9 takes her place alongside @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 on friday , it will appear that @entity15 has returned this great club to the elite level			1
in reality it will be a clash of cultures as @entity3 , who have kept nine clean sheets in their last ten fixtures , plot their path to the @entity27 final in @entity28			1
it will be painful and far from pretty if @entity3 , who held on to the lead @entity32 gave them from the penalty spot in the first leg against @entity36 , progress to the final on june 6			1
there were scenes of elation as a scoreless draw saw @entity3 through to their first @entity27 semi-final since 2003 @entity3 's @entity44 and @entity45 react at the full - time whistle as their 0 - 0 result against @entity36 proved a victory for the @entity49 @entity3 players celebrate after their 1 - 0 win in @entity9 , courtesy of a penalty from @entity54 , was preserved in @entity36 the @entity3 players ran to their supporters with @entity45 ( third left ) ditching his jersey for the celebrations @entity59 ( left ) and @entity60 race towards their fans , before @entity59 throws his number three shirt into the crowd veteran @entity3 keeper @entity64 punches clear as his defense live dangerously in their second leg against @entity36 @entity3 's midfield maestro @entity44 shows his strength as he holds off @entity36 's @entity70 in their 0 - 0 draw in @entity72 @entity36 : @entity73 6 ; @entity74 7 , @entity75 6 , @entity76 6.5 , @entity77 6 ; @entity78 6.5 , @entity70 6 ( @entity79 46mins , 7 ) , @entity80 7.5 ; @entity81 6.5 , martial 6 ( @entity82 ' , @entity83 6.5 ( @entity84 87 ' )			1

at the final whistle @entity59 raced across the athletics track at @entity111 to throw his number three shirt into the hordes of @entity3 supporters celebrating their first appearance in a semi-final since 2003			1
the feeling is that @entity3 ’s race is run			2
on the surface @entity15 ’s team are looking good , 15 points clear of second placed @entity122 in @entity123 and heading for a semi-final against a genuine @entity6 force in a couple of weeks ’ time			0
the reality is that this team is relying on some classic @entity49 traits , with some stubborn defending and the dogged work of @entity45 , @entity3 ’s only out ball , for some hustling up front			1
it works , painfully so at times , and they are certainly a long way short of the last @entity3 team to reach the @entity27 final at @entity139 in 12 year ago			1
back then @entity141 ’s team had some real class , with the names of @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 taking @entity148 to a penalty shoot - out in @entity150			2
today ’s team relies on the presence of their veteran goalkeeper @entity64 , a survivor from that defeated 2003 team , to provide some reassurance			2
before this tie against @entity36 , the @entity49 @entity157 winning goalkeeper spoke about the honour and prestige for @entity3 if they could reach the semi-final			1
the second leg was all about survival			2
at times this was about the darker side of the game , with @entity59 shown an early yellow card when he scandalously scooped the ball away with his hand to prevent @entity78 racing clear			0
all three at the back - @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity92 - lived dangerously , a mistake waiting to happen on a tense and anxious night			2
@entity36 were brisk and innovative , using the first half energy of their central midfielder @entity173 to provide the momentum for @entity177 side			0
@entity173 deserved so much more from this tie			0
@entity3 and @entity179 defender @entity59 ( left ) reaches out to pull the ball away from @entity36 's @entity78 after slipping over @entity108 referee @entity107 ( right ) is forced into his pocket inside the opening minute after @entity59 's handball stopped an attack @entity3 striker @entity45 takes on @entity36 's @entity173 after referee @entity185 plays the advantage former @entity187 and @entity188 marksman @entity45 puts his hands to his mouth as a well - hit strike sails off target he had a decent shout for a penalty in the first half when he was sandwiched between @entity59 and @entity32 , sent off balance when the pair squashed him as he made his way into the area			1
@entity173 was awesome here and anyone who can outshine @entity44 , save for the odd killer pass for @entity45 or @entity98 , in the centre of midfield must be doing something right			0
@entity45 and @entity98 , who was eventually replaced in the 69th minute by @entity99 , should be credited for their tireless performance in this second leg because they had both picked up a virus the night before the game			2
both are believed to have been sick on the pitch			0
it was @entity45 who had @entity3 ’s best chance here , an effort that skidding wide of @entity36 keeper @entity218 ’s left hand post on the stroke of half - time			1
@entity36 sent for @entity79 at the break , sending on the @entity223 striker to replace the withdrawn figure of @entity225 midfielder @entity70			0
he had a poor game here			0
former @entity228 full back @entity96 ( right ) takes on @entity36 's @entity74 at pace in @entity36 on wednesday night @entity36 's @entity173 attempts to squeeze between @entity59 ( left ) and @entity32 ( right ) and goes down but penalty appeals were denied @entity74 ( left ) and @entity3 midfielder @entity32 each show their studs high as they challenge for the bouncing ball @entity36 goalkeeper @entity218 ( right ) anticipates a dangerous ball over the top from @entity44 before @entity235 ( 26 ) can meet it @entity236 defender @entity235 knows how key @entity73 's speed off the line was as he comes close to an opening goal for @entity3 there was a touch of the old @entity79 in this 45 minute spell , increasing the tempo with some quick - witted first team passes and some blindside runs into the @entity3 penalty area			1
what he craved was the one chance to beat @entity64 , to carve out an opening that could , at the very least , have given them another 30 minutes to get the job done			0
instead , @entity3 are heading for extra time			2
@entity36 's @entity255 midfielder and captain @entity70 ( left ) is beaten to the jump by @entity3 's @entity258 forward @entity98 @entity70 ( left ) , who returned to the @entity36 line - up after missing the first leg defeat , keeps tight on @entity98 @entity44 stems a @entity36 attack from the ground with his body and arm as @entity81 attempts to takes his side forward on the counter @entity173 ( right ) deserved more from the game after a towering performance in the centre of @entity36 's midfield @entity79 ( left ) , who came on for @entity70 at half - time , contests the ball in the air with @entity3 defender @entity60 the @entity275 's @entity274 ( centre ) plots his side 's next move forward under pressure from @entity281 striker @entity45 ( right ) he added intensity , charging about the pitch in search of the ball as @entity287 ’s team went about the business of finding an opener			1
they needed it , the one chance to beat @entity3 keeper @entity64 to give them a chance of reaching the semi-final of the @entity27			1
@entity64 was a key player here			0
he made a couple of decent stops , but his commanding presence and his reassuring nature in that @entity3 goal is a formidable hurdle for the opposition			2
here , he simply could not be beaten			0
@entity303 midfielder @entity81 ( left ) finds himself in the book after this wild challenge on @entity3 midfielder @entity94 @entity45 attempt on goal flies clear of the target as both sides struggled to break to deadlock in the second leg it was hugs all round for the @entity3 players as they booked their place in friday 's draw for the @entity27 semi-finals @entity3 manager @entity15 gestures to his players as two tight defensive units did battle @entity36 head coach @entity91 makes a praying gesture as his side are asked to force the pace against @entity3 prince @entity324 ( right ) attends @entity36 vs @entity3 with his nephew @entity325 ( left ) the red and white scarves of @entity36 's home colours are shown ahead of kick - off as they will their side towards a potential semi-final a strong contingent from the @entity49 champions were in the @entity111 for their @entity27 quarter - final second leg			1

@entity3 go through to the @entity27 semi-finals 1 - 0 on *aggregate* after second leg draw
@entity32 's penalty in the first leg in @entity341 proved enough to earn the @entity49 a date with winner in @entity14
@entity14 defeated 10 - man @entity345 1 - 0 in their second leg clash after a 0 - 0 deadlock in their first leg
