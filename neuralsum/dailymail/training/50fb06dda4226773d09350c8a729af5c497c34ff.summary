have you ever ditched your shopping basket in @entity2 because you ca n't face the queue for the changing rooms ? or maybe you 've avoided picking up some post-jog supermarket essentials because you ca n't face heading round the store in sweaty clothing			0
well help is now on the way , thanks to the invention of a new maxi dress that means you can get changed while in a busy public place , without anyone catching a glimpse of what lies underneath			1
it means ladies can switch outfits in public without flashing any skin the creation , called the @entity28 , looks like a long dress with a halter top and long skirt , but comes packed with extras including pockets , drawstrings and the ability to shorten the skirt and reverse the design			1
the design means the days of changing behind a precariously - placed beach towel or in the backseat of a car are over			2
the @entity19 is the brainchild of entrepreneurs @entity44 and april @entity45 , who organise sports events for charity in their home city of @entity50			2
the @entity19 is expected to cost $ 75 ( £ 45 ) when it goes on sale later this year			1
mrs @entity45 said : ' i love the fact that @entity28 gives women like me the freedom to change anywhere they want to			0
' when i took up running for the first time last year , i was shocked by how difficult and uncomfortable it was to change out of my clothes , especially my sports bra , immediately after a run			0
' the @entity28 is designed for busy women who often need to get changed out of outfits while heading from one activity to another she continued : ' it 's hard for women to find a discrete place to change out in public but it 's awesome that it 'll no longer be a problem with @entity28			1
' for runners , swimmers , surfers , cross-trainers , mums , travellers and other women with several places to be in one day , it often leaves little time and means to change outfits			1
' as an innovative apparel invention , @entity28 is designed with two side access openings , a slip - under front panel , drawstring , front inner lining , and other special features that make the transition of changing without being exposed possible			2
' the @entity19 makes living an active lifestyle more convenient than ever			0
' the ' @entity28 ' comes in a range of colours and will go on sale later this year priced at $ 75 ( £ 45 ) mr @entity44 added : ' working in active sports myself , i 've seen that one of the hardest things for women about working out is n't the workout itself - it 's changing out of their sweaty clothes afterwards			1
' even as a guy i see and feel the discomfort that women have to go through when they try to sneak in their cars to change or try to inconspicuously change under a towel			0
' but now , women no longer have to take the risk of bearing it all			0
' there 's a solution for them and it 's called @entity28			0
