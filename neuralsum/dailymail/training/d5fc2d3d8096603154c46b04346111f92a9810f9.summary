by @entity0 published : 15:47 est , 1 august 2013 updated : 15:54 est , 1 august 2013 care : @entity1 required full - time care in the months after his stroke			1
his wife of 26 years said he was reduced to a ' half - paralysed invalid ' when broadcaster @entity1 suffered a massive stroke which left him a ‘ half - paralysed invalid ’ , his life changed overnight			1
yesterday his wife revealed for the first time the huge impact his sudden illness had on her - and made a heartfelt plea for greater support for @entity14 ’s carers			1
@entity15 , 58 , gave up work for six months to become a full - time carer for her husband while he recovered from the stroke which almost killed him			1
she told how ‘ exhausting , monotonous and frustrating ’ she found aspects of caring for him during his recuperation , but said it had also given her a better perspective on life			1
the mother - of - three said : ‘ i am no @entity29 and there ’s no damn halo visible when i look in the mirror : this is just what any decent relative would do for someone who is physically disabled			2
‘ one stroke victim wrote to tell me he thought that carers for stroke sufferers all experience some kind of post-traumatic stress disorder			1
‘ i would n’t go that far , but it can be tough , and carers everywhere need support and breaks			2
’ mr @entity1 , 53 , suffered a serious stroke in january this year which damaged his left arm and leg , leaving him needing intensive physiotherapy			1
doctors warned his wife he might not survive the bleeding in his brain and that if he lived he could be left unable to move , see , speak or hear			2
following months of rehabilitation , he is now preparing to return to broadcasting full - time next month			1
while his voice and memory are intact , he said his walking was still ‘ a bit wobbly ’			0
miss @entity58 , his wife of 26 years , has also returned to her work as a columnist for the @entity62 newspaper , and described the dramatic impact the stroke had on the couple ’s lives			2
he said : ‘ he went from being a super-energetic , fit , over-worker to a half - paralysed invalid			1
‘ his life had totally changed , but of course , as many kind friends have pointed out , mine had too ... i had never been a full - time carer			1
‘ it is , above all , exhausting			0
it can also be extremely monotonous and frustrating for both the patient and the carer			0
’ miss @entity58 praised ‘ brilliant support ’ given to her husband from doctors , nurses and physiotherapists during his time in hospital			2
challenging : @entity15 said her life changed after her husband 's stroke , and the support they were given in hospital stopped once they returned home but she said the level of support for stroke victims dropped dramatically once they left hospital , despite an ongoing need for occupational and physiotherapy			1
she called for greater flexibility from employers to cope with the growing need for workers to take time off to care for elderly parents and other relatives			1
around six million people , or one in eight adults in @entity14 are carers , according to @entity109			0
half of those juggle care commitments with work , but the demands of caring mean that one in five eventually have to give up working , according to the charity			2
by 2037 , it estimates that the number of carers in @entity14 will increase to nine million			0
miss @entity58 , the daughter of @entity119 peer lord @entity118 , the first deaf mp , said many people became carers ‘ @entity122 ’ after an illness or accident left a relative needing help			2
she said : ‘ the world of work is not set up to deal with this			0
too many older women lose their jobs after a few months off to care for an elderly parent , or other relative			2
return : @entity1 is due to resume full - time broadcasting in september ‘ just as we now accept that women need to take some time out for childcare , surely we should be able to re-arrange the world of work so that “ carer ’s leave ” becomes a normal part of all our lives , men included			1
’ @entity109 chief executive @entity142 ( corr ) said a recent study had found the cost to the economy of carers who were forced to give up work was around £ 1.3billion per year			0
one in seven employees currently juggles full - time work with a care commitment , she said			1
she added : ‘ as the population ages more and more of us will become carers			0
this is one of society ’s biggest challenges			0
‘ if people are forced to give up work there ’s a loss to the economy because they may need benefits and support , and they wo n’t be paying taxes			0
‘ if employers can support people to carry on working then they are not losing valuable employees , and they do n’t have to recruit to replace them			0
’ mr @entity1 has spoken movingly of the support he has received from his wife and their children @entity173 , 23 , @entity174 , 21 , and 18 - year - old @entity175 , saying : ‘ @entity15 saved my life			1
without her , i would n’t be here ... i was saved by my family			0
’ he also said he was happier since the stroke , as it had given him a better perspective on his previously ‘ brittle , narrow , overstressed life ’			0
miss @entity58 said it had also changed her attitudes , saying : ‘ i have become aware of just how fragile life is			0
‘ we walk in the sunlight , ignoring the shadows			0
in the blink of an eye lives can be changed utterly ... there is nothing like a near - death experience to put life ’s little annoyances into perspective and to learn to live each day for the day			0
