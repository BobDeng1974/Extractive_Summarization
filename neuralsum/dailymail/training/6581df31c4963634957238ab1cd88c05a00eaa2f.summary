under - fire : npower chief executive @entity0 told @entity2 the company had paid no corporation tax in the @entity5 for the last three years energy giant @entity6 has admitted paying no @entity5 corporation tax for three years despite making £ 766million in profits			1
the revelation emerged yesterday during fierce questioning of the company 's chief executive by @entity2			1
@entity6 joins @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 in coming under fire for making millions in @entity5 while contributing little to the @entity18 's coffers			1
the company 's average dual fuel bill has risen by £ 257 in just two years – leaving households facing punishing annual payments of £ 1,352			2
in theory , the £ 766million profits for the period 2009 to 2011 could have generated a tax bill of £ 200million rather than staying wholly with @entity27 parent company @entity26 and its shareholders			1
@entity29 , a @entity30 mp , suggested several of the ' big six ' power firms were paying less corporation tax than they should – with @entity6 the worst offender			1
@entity0 , who heads the firm , admitted it had paid no corporation tax in the three years			2
however , he insisted the situation was perfectly acceptable because @entity6 had put the cost of building wind farms against its tax liability			1
mr @entity29 said he was amazed by this and customers would struggle to understand such a ' surprising ' explanation			0
fellow @entity30 mp @entity44 said : ' everyone watching these proceedings will be absolutely shocked that you are willing to stand up and say we deserve not to pay tax			1
if i said that , i would be crucified			0
the firm in part blamed investment in wind farms for its failure to pay corporation tax to the @entity18 ( file picture ) ' you have used the rules to suit yourself			2
i am glad i do n't get my energy from you , if i did i would be switching as soon as i left this room , i am so annoyed about it			0
' rise : @entity6 's @entity5 profits have increased and so have average household fuel bills mr @entity0 replied : ' we have invested £ 5billion in the last five years building power plants , creating jobs , creating employment and helping to keep the lights on			0
' there is no mystery to it , there is no desire not to pay tax			0
the fact is you are allowed depreciation for your investments			0
and we have been the biggest investor by a mile in the renewable offshore business			0
' if we had not made that investment , we would not have the ( tax ) deductibility that we would be allowed			0
that is a simple @entity5 accounting rule			0
' mr @entity0 said the only way the @entity5 will get the £ 110billion of investment needed in new power supplies by 2020 will be through tax breaks for energy firms			2
energy bosses were giving evidence to an inquiry into prices , profit and poverty by the energy and climate change select committee			0
mps blasted @entity101 , which was recently fined £ 10.5million for signing up thousands of customers on the basis of misleading information			0
the firm revealed it made around £ 45 a year from each of the estimated 23,000 customers affected by mis - selling			2
@entity109 , the firm 's deputy chief executive , apologised and said the company had changed its training and audit procedures to correct the problem			1
@entity115 , which owns @entity116 , paid £ 1.5billion in corporation tax over the period in which @entity6 paid nothing			0
last year npower increased gas bills by 8.8 per cent and electricity prices by 9.1 per cent protestors picketed @entity15 chains across the country , including this one in @entity126 , after it admitted paying little or no company tax after the evidence session , mr @entity29 said : ' in the last three years @entity6 have reported profits totalling £ 766 million – yet today they admitted they have not paid a single penny of corporation tax over that period			1
' people who pay their taxes unquestioningly are sick and tired of seeing hugely profitable companies use every trick in the book to get out of contributing their fair share			1
' hard - pressed families struggling with sky - high energy bills will be absolutely astonished that an energy company which makes hundreds of millions in profits does n't appear to be paying its fair share in tax			1

@entity27 - owned firm joins under - fire @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15
