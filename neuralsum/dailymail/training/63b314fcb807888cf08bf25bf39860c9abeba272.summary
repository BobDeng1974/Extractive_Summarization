by @entity0 published : 18:16 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 05:31 est , 23 april 2013 laying blame : health secretary @entity2 accused the union of not listening to @entity4 nurses warnings the @entity7 hospital scandal was partly the fault of the main nursing union , @entity2 claimed yesterday			1
the health secretary launched his scathing attack on the @entity12 after it criticised his plans to improve compassion in the @entity15			1
mr @entity2 said the @entity12 , which attacked a move to make all student nurses spend a year doing menial tasks , had been criticised for being more concerned about their members than patients			1
he told the @entity12 to be ‘ very careful ’ and pointed out that a damning report into @entity4 – where up to 1,200 patients died from neglect – said the union had failed to listen to nurses ’ warnings of unnecessary suffering			1
the @entity29 said the @entity12 had been ‘ ineffective ’ because it had defended senior ‘ bullying ’ nurses responsible for appalling care			1
attacking mr @entity2 ’s proposals for student nurses to work on the wards before starting their degrees , @entity12 president @entity33 said the ‘ stupid ’ idea risked taking the profession ‘ back a hundred years ’			1
but mr @entity2 said : ‘ the royal college of nursing have got to be very , very careful			2
they missed what happened at @entity4			1
the @entity29 levelled some very serious criticisms			2
it said that they basically allowed their trade union responsibilities to trump their responsibilities as a royal college to raise professional standards			2
‘ before they start criticising the government for accepting recommendations that are going to improve compassionate care throughout the @entity15 , they need to answer those very , very serious criticisms			2
’ the government wants student nurses to spend a year as healthcare assistants , for washing and feeding elderly patients and assisting them to the toilet			1
but so far there are no details on how hospitals will be able to supervise them			2
yesterday the prime minister promised to push ahead with the plans , saying they were ‘ absolutely vital ’			2
he said : ‘ it ’s going to be controversial , but in the end the sort of health service we want is not just about making sure we ’ve got the facts and the figures and the money and everything else spent well , it ’s ... so when our elderly relatives go in there , we know they ’re going to get a really good quality of care			1
’ at fault : the @entity12 , whose members took part in the protest against cuts at @entity85 last week , is partly to blame for the @entity4 scandal the @entity29 warned that the @entity12 had ‘ done little ’ to act			1
one whistleblower , @entity87 , said she tried to raise concerns about the @entity90 unit only to find the union was defending two senior nurses she said were bullies			1
she became too afraid to walk to her car after a shift in case she was attacked by colleagues			0
@entity101 ’s new health adviser sir @entity102 came under attack last night after it emerged he has previously dismissed those angry at the @entity4 scandal as a ‘ lynch mob ’			1
@entity108 mp @entity107 said : ‘ @entity109 is still in denial over its responsibility for @entity4 , and this appointment shows they have learned nothing from the tragedy			1
they have not accepted that their tick - box culture is responsible for the events			0
’ at the height of the scandal in 2008 , @entity12 general secretary @entity118 visited @entity121 and praised nursing care as being of ‘ exceptionally high standard ’			1
mr @entity118 admitted yesterday there were ‘ failings on our part ’ but said the @entity12 had n’t ‘ missed @entity4 ’ adding : ‘ we ’re not a regulator			1
’ the @entity29 warned that the scandal could be repeated			0
yesterday a survey of more than 8,000 nurses by the @entity12 found that two - thirds believe neglect could happen at their own hospital			1
one in four is too scared to raise concerns about patient safety and a further one in four said when they had tried to raise concerns their bosses had done nothing			0
forty - six per cent had tried to raise concerns about patient safety in the past six months			0
of these , 44 per cent said fears of ‘ victimisation ’ or ‘ reprisal ’ would make them think twice about whistleblowing in future			0
medical neglect : @entity146 a doctor dismissed a grandfather as a ‘ drama king ’ hours before he died in agony , an inquest heard yesterday			0
@entity146 , 66 , was recovering after a back operation when his abdomen became swollen and tender			0
although mr @entity146 was in extreme pain , staff failed to diagnose that he was suffering from internal bleeding and he was wrongly given blood thinners			1
the coroner ruled that father - of - two mr @entity146 , a retired bailiff , died of medical neglect and a surgeon who reviewed his treatment said he had been the victim of a ‘ whole system failure ’ by staff at @entity166 in @entity167			0
health chiefs apologised to his family yesterday and promised an investigation			2
the inquest heard that mr @entity146 , of @entity172 , @entity173 , had been recovering well last october when his condition suddenly deteriorated			0
staff nurse @entity175 told the coroner mr @entity146 could n’t move his legs and ‘ felt something pop ’			0
‘ i told the senior house officer who referred to him as being a drama king , ’ she said			0
senior house officer dr @entity181 denied the claim			0
‘ that ’s just not how i would speak about my patients			0
’ the inquest heard that ward manager @entity186 became so concerned she went over dr @entity181 ’s head			0
he was given blood , but died from shock as a result of the haemorrhage			0
surgeon @entity193 , who carried out a review of the treatment , told the hearing : ‘ the whole thing was just dysfunctional			0
there ’s been effectively a whole system failure			0
’ @entity167 assistant deputy coroner @entity201 ruled that mr @entity146 died as a result of neglect by hospital staff .			2
