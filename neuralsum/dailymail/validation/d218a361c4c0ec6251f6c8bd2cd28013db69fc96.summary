the allegations were as vindictive and damaging as they were utterly false			1
yet they all but destroyed primary school teacher @entity2			1
@entity2 , 45 , had for 16 years been an exemplary teacher : popular with pupils and respected by colleagues			1
yet in just a year his reputation was shattered , he lost his job and became clinically depressed , prey to anxiety and panic			2
@entity11 ( pictured with his wife , @entity12 ) had 18 charges made against him concerning child abuse a £ 25,000 legal bill exhausted his entire savings and ate into those of his parents			1
his reputation unjustly besmirched , he and his wife @entity12 — who has two grown - up daughters by a previous relationship — had to give up their dream of adopting a child			2
and this awful ordeal was caused by five boy pupils from his @entity27 primary school who accused him of sexual abuse			1
it ’s the worst accusation that could be levied against a teacher			1
and in today ’s climate , where historic cases of the abuse of children are as prolific as they are disturbing , the police , quite rightly , had to act			1
yet the most cursory of checks would have revealed that his accusers were troublemakers : disruptive , aggressive , defiant and precociously sexualised			2
but once the boys — present and past pupils aged ten to 12 — had made the allegations that their teacher had inappropriately touched them and instigated sexual activity , the machinery of the law was set in motion			1
and despite the complete absence of evidence , it would destroy the name of a good man in the process			2
in january , a year after @entity2 was first arrested , a jury at @entity54 acquitted him , swiftly and unanimously , on all charges			1
he had pleaded not guilty to 17 counts of sexual assault on a male child under the age of 13 and one count of causing or inciting a male child under 13 to engage in sexual activity			1
@entity2 and @entity12 's ( pictured ) lives were destroyed when the allegations against @entity65 were made so how could @entity2 be left with a life in tatters while five malicious trouble - makers are carrying on with their lives , without so much as a telling off ? these are questions @entity2 and @entity12 , 43 , a reflexologist and sales assistant , are asking themselves			1
@entity2 says : ‘ when i was charged , i was no longer mr @entity2 , a respected village primary school teacher			1
instead , i was a pariah			2
i was too scared to leave the house			2
i became introverted , and i lost 2 st. yet the boys who accused me have been able to hide behind a curtain of anonymity while my name was publicised			1
‘ my accusers should be punished for making false and damaging claims against me			2
but they are all carrying on as though nothing has happened while i have to piece together my shattered life			2
’ shattered is the correct word : @entity2 ’s teaching contract was terminated in july			1
‘ i do n’t know if i can ever face standing in a classroom of pupils , wondering if one of them is about to make a complaint , ’ he says			2
@entity2 ’s nightmare began in january last year			1
he had driven to school and by 6.45am was sitting at his desk , planning his lessons			2
one matter was preying on his mind : how to deal with a particularly disruptive pupil			0
@entity2 had already spoken about him to the school ’s headteacher			1
the day before , he had called the ten - year - old ’s mother , inviting her to school to discuss her son ’s behaviour			2
it was getting virtually impossible to teach with him interrupting , shouting wisecracks and refusing to do any work			0
then an hour later , he was summoned to his head ’s office			0
facing him were two police officers			0
‘ i was told i was being arrested on suspicion of sexual assault on a minor , ’ he recalls			2
‘ and the child making the accusations was the same pupil causing problems			0
@entity2 ( pictured ) had , for 16 years , been an exemplary teacher : popular with pupils and respected by colleagues ‘ i was completely , utterly dumbfounded			1
but my first thought was : “ this will all be dismissed when the police investigate it and realise there is absolutely no foundation in it at all			0
” ’ but in the space of 12 months his life would be thrown into tumult as 18 charges were made against him concerning the children , the first boy and four others the ten - year - old knew			0
on that january day , @entity2 spent nine hours in police custody where every aspect of his teaching style was scrutinised			1
he had , on his own admission , a tactile approach			0
he explains : ‘ i would often praise children by giving them a pat on the back or a tap on the knee			0
i ’d never questioned that it was inappropriate			0
but this boy claimed i had touched him in a sexual manner			2
’ child sexual abuse costs the @entity150 an estimated £ 3.2 billion a year because of social care , health problems and legal bills @entity12 , his wife of ten years , was by now dealing with her own shock			1
two - and - a - half hours after her husband was arrested , two officers arrived at their four - bedroom terrace house in @entity159			0
@entity12 recalls : ‘ my initial thought was that @entity2 had been in an accident			1
i asked if he was dead			0
‘ but when they said he had been arrested for sexual assault , i was floored			2
the officers had come to search our home for possible evidence and to seize electronic equipment			0
‘ my legs would hardly hold me up as the police rooted through our bedroom			0
although i knew @entity2 had done nothing wrong , i felt as though we were criminals			1
‘ they looked through my work files and took away our @entity178 , mobiles , a kindle and memory sticks			0
they spent months examining them , but did n’t find a single suspicious thing			0
’ when @entity2 arrived home at 6.30pm , he was exhausted and bewildered			1
@entity12 says : ‘ he could barely speak			0
but i never once doubted his innocence			0
’ both he and @entity12 were confident a short investigation would swiftly exonerate him			0
they told only close friends and family of the accusations			0
@entity12 ( pictured ) says : ‘ i never once doubted his innocence			0
' but the nightmare escalated			0
last march , @entity2 was arrested again			1
a further four ex-pupils who knew one another in some way claimed he had inappropriately touched them and instigated sexual activity			2
‘ i had no idea why they would make up such malicious and despicable lies , ’ he recalls			0
in april , he was formally charged with the sexual assaults against five boys : a ten - year - old current pupil ; three 11 - year - olds and a 12 - year - old			2
but their stories were inconsistent			0
some attested the assaults took place while he was teaching , others said it was while he was alone in his classroom talking one - to - one with them			0
and evidence read out in court supported the fact that each of the accusers was a known troublemaker			0
the youngest had boasted he would ‘ get mr @entity2 fired ’			1
one of the 11 - year - olds had grabbed another boy ’s genitals , exposed himself and pinned down a female pupil until she cried			0
even his own mother admitted in a meeting at his school , after @entity2 ’s arrest , she ’d seen nothing in her son ’s behaviour to indicate he had been abused			1
@entity12 recalls the fallout of the allegations			2
‘ @entity2 had always been so full of life and very jovial , but overnight his character changed			1
’ her husband — a caring step - father to her two daughters — barely spoke and became consumed by fear			0
he suffered from anxiety and tremors , and his gp prescribed antidepressants			0
‘ i felt utterly useless , ’ says @entity12			0
‘ but i had to be the strong one			0
’ @entity2 endured further distress when a local radio station misinterpreted the charges against him and broadcast that he ’d had sex with young boys			1
and the case brought one devastating side - effect			0
@entity2 and @entity12 — whose daughters are 19 and 22 — had long dreamt of having a child of their own			1
@entity12 had , however , suffered from fertility problems , and they had enquired about adoption			0
‘ but with abuse charges hanging over @entity2 , we would never be considered , ’ says @entity12			1
the legal proceedings consumed their savings , and @entity2 ’s parents — in no doubt of their son ’s innocence — chipped in			1
@entity2 ( pictured ) says he became consumed by fear and was prescribed antidepressants for his anxiety and tremors as the case approached , a swell of support buoyed them up			1
@entity2 recalls : ‘ parents of ex-pupils would stop me in the street and give me a hug , all of them telling me they did n’t believe a word of the claims			1
‘ but i still felt terrified			0
my solicitor had warned me if i was found guilty i faced up to seven years in prison and my name would be tarnished for ever			2
mercifully , the jury took just an hour to dismiss each of the charges against @entity2			1
@entity12 was with her daughters in court and when the verdict came , she was euphoric			0
‘ i squeezed my daughters ’ hands , ’ she recalls			0
‘ i just wanted to run to @entity2 and hug him			1
’ justice had prevailed , but at what cost ? ‘ i do n’t know whether i will ever completely recover , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ everyone who knew us supported me , but there will always be strangers who believe there ’s no smoke without fire			0
’ @entity12 adds : ‘ i can never forgive @entity2 ’s accusers			1
i truly believe the youngest of them was acting in revenge , and then the other boys joined a nasty , ill - conceived vendetta to try to destroy him			0
‘ and if this is what teachers face — and we are told that false sexual accusations against them are not uncommon — the whole profession must feel under threat			2
‘ and one thing is certain : i do n’t want @entity2 to return to a classroom ever again			1
