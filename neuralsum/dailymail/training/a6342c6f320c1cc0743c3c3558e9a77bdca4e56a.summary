by @entity0 published : 12:26 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 12:56 est , 9 january 2013 troubled : @entity2 , who died after falling from a block of flats , was filmed being forced to perform sex acts on two youths , an inquest heard today a 13 - year - old girl plunged 60 feet to her death after mobile phone footage of her being forced to perform sex acts on two youths began spreading around her school , an inquest heard today			1
@entity2 , 13 , had been forced into performing sex acts on the boys at a party just a month before her death in march 2011 , the hearing was told			1
@entity18 today also heard of a ' chain ' of mistakes from school staff responsible for pupil welfare			1
a friend of @entity2 spoke of how the video began circulating among pupils at @entity27 's @entity26 in @entity28 , south @entity29 , showing the tragic teen performing the sex acts			1
the friend , who can not be named for legal reasons , told the hearing : ' there was girls on my bus talking about a video and @entity2 was in it			1
' i saw it when i was at my friend 's nan 's			2
we were outside and some boys were next to us and they was like " do you know @entity2 ? "			1
' they gave us the phone and said ' watch this '			2
i looked at it until i realised what was going on and then looked away			2
' the friend , named only as @entity51 , told the hearing the boy with @entity54 in the video was black , and that someone else was recording it from directly behind the teen so she did not know if she knew she was being recorded			1
she added : ' there was a friend who was talking to me			2
' she said @entity2 was getting bullied about the video because people from her school had seen or heard about it			1
' her friends were saying she were n't really happy and she was a bubbly person , but got really sad and were n't who she was			2
' the inquest also heard the teenager was branded a ' narcissistic attention - seeker ' by the teacher in charge of child protection			2
tragic : the hearing was told @entity73 , 13 , was sexually - abused at a party and bullied before she died teacher @entity76 today admitted repeated failures , including giving the impression that @entity2 was a ' narcissistic attention - seeker ' in a referral to a mental health authority			1
the inquest heard how mr @entity76 , who was the teacher responsible for child protection at the @entity26 school , did not paint a ' clear picture ' of the troubled teen in a letter to @entity90 ( @entity90 ) , the inquest heard			2
@entity2 had been repeatedly bullied at the school by a gang of boys and had started cutting herself with scissors in class , the hearing was told			1
mr @entity76 , who handed in his notice before @entity2 's death , told the inquest he was ' let down ' by @entity28 social services who failed to pass the case on to mental health services			1
sorrow : floral tributes were laid outside @entity104 in @entity105 , where the 13 - year - old fell to her death but he did not know the school had a social worker who would have been able to offer advice and help fill in the referral			2
when asked by @entity114 coroner @entity113 if he should have done anything differently , mr @entity76 replied : ' yes			1
there are three main areas i would 've done differently			2
' firstly , the delay in the sexual assault information being passed on			2
i waited for fuller information , but i should 've let mr @entity122 [ the head teacher ] know straight away			2
' secondly , i focused on the support which had already been given to @entity54 which led me to let social services fall off my radar and i should n't have done that			2
' finally , i had n't painted a full picture on the @entity90 referral			0
i was trying to paint a picture on the behaviours @entity2 was displaying			1
' i should 've focused on other pupils			1
it would 've have provided a clearer picture had i done that			0
' mr @entity135 said to mr @entity76 : ' the impression you gave was that she was narcissistic and attention - seeking			0
' mr @entity76 replied : ' if that is the conclusion , that was not my intention			0
' however , when rumours of the sexual activity began to circulate around the school mr @entity76 said he did not know how to deal with the abuse claims			0
he told the inquest he turned to head teacher mr @entity122 for advice what to do when the allegations first came to light			0
he said : ' mr @entity122 was the person to speak with for advice			0
' it was a situation i have never come across before			0
if he had n't been in , i would contact him at home or contact someone else who had child protection training			0
' i know it would not be an acceptable amount of delay for a child protection officer			0
i was slow and action should be taken as soon as possible			0
' however , mr @entity135 pointed out ' nobody seemed to understand ' what was going to happen to @entity54 after the allegations surfaced because she had not been taken straight to a police station for dna testing			0
grief : @entity169 at the inquest of her daughter @entity2 on monday mr @entity76 added : ' contacting her family - that was our priority			1
our intention was in the best interests of @entity54 and her family			0
now we would drop everything			0
' the hearing also heard how a school nurse did not follow up a referral over @entity2 's self - harming because of ' work demands '			1
@entity185 was a nurse at @entity188 's school and told the inquest she was qualified to deal with self - harm cases and took the work from mr @entity76			0
however , although she saw @entity2 , she never followed up on the referral to mental health services because of ' work demands '			1
@entity196 , representing the family , said to mr @entity76 : ' a teacher asked the nurse to see @entity2 because of her attendance due to health issues			1
' there were reports of @entity54 cutting herself			0
' there was a referral , but the nurse did n't follow it up because of work demands			0
' mr @entity76 replied : ' there were n't systems in place to check things were being followed up			0
' i referred this to ms @entity214 because she was in an appropriate position to deal with self - harm			0
' mr @entity135 said : ' well , she is n't because she ca n't prioritise			0
' although mr @entity76 was told by the nurse , who has since retired , that she was an ' appropriate ' person to speak to about @entity54 's problems , he did not take any steps to make sure she was , the inquest heard			0
and the teacher told the hearing it was not a child protection issue , even though the troubled teen was self - harming			1
mr @entity76 added : ' there comes a time where you have to trust people 's professionalism			0
' the impression you gave was that she was narcissistic and attention - seeking			0
' coroner @entity113 , speaking to mr @entity76 ' if someone has a particular profession , we have to trust the professional words they have given us			1
it was not child protection , although it was self - harming			1
' mr @entity135 said : ' there is a difference between someone who has no problems with pupils and those who self - harm			1
' if @entity2 threw herself out the window , that is one of the most destructive things she can do			1
' if she did , it might be because of mental health problems that started when she cut herself			0
' he told the hearing the ' failure ' is the ' start of a chain ' of mistakes , and questioned mr @entity76 's referral to social services as it ' was not what it was meant to be ' the teacher agreed , saying it ' was n't as full as it should be ' as he has not had ' direct training ' in filling out the documents			1
and when he told the inquest @entity2 had become more ' positive ' in year 9 , mr @entity135 said : ' what about if you were lulled into a false sense of security ? you did n't chase up the referral form			1
' mr @entity76 replied : ' it fell of my radar			0
' the inquest continues .			0
