@entity2 , 26 , alleged that she had been dragged into an office at night , threatened with a knife and injected with drugs			1
the attackers were said to have tied her up with ropes , cut her with a knife and burnt her with a cigarette lighter while raping her			1
but today she admitted had lied but maintained she had been the victim of two genuine attacks and had exaggerated so senior managers would take her seriously			1
she told the hearing she was very distressed and upset after she was pinned down and kicked in two incidents at the hospital			1
but the medic decided to ' embellish ' the attacks by saying she had also been raped , sexually assaulted and also became pregnant as a result			1
she said : ' the whole event was very distressing			2
it was a shock and i found myself more nervous , more anxious , not sleeping very well , more tearful than usual			2
' i wanted some support and to ensure i was supported i did embellish my account			2
i think it was a way of trying to express the distress i was feeling			2
' i did n't feel that i was entitled to feel as distressed as i did			2
i was worried other people might have a similar view to me , that they might feel that it was not that serious and wonder why i was not my usual self and why i was anxious and distressed			2
' the medic , who qualified in 2010 , added : ' i was worried that unless the attack itself had been serious that people would not take it seriously			2
' scene : the alleged incidents happened at @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45 the doctor , who has been in a same - sex relationship since 2005 and is expecting a baby next january , was appearing before a panel at the @entity50 in @entity51 who will decide whether she is fit to continue with her career			1
the hearing was told that as a result of the false complaints of rape the hospital trust launched its own investigation and spent around Â£ 10,000 to increase staff security			0
the alleged incidents happened at @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45 and were reported to police			1
she now admits the rape allegations were false but insists she was physically attacked on two occasions , on april 1 and june 3 , 2011			1
she said : ' i was walking back towards the doctor 's office at about 4am as it had got to a stage in the night when i was able to take a break so i was going back to the office			1
outside the hearing : the attackers were said to have tied @entity2 up with ropes , cut her with a knife and burnt her with a cigarette lighter while raping her ' the door had a combination lock on it and as i walked in i felt somebody 's arm around my neck and shoulders and was pushed down to the ground			1
' i felt i was being held down on the ground			0
somebody had pushed my head and shoulders to the ground and i felt i could n't get away			0
' i thought there must have been two [ attackers ]			0
i knew i was being held down but also being kicked to my left side , by my ribs			0
' she added : ' at one point , i managed to get to my hands and knees but was quite quickly kicked back down to the floor			0
i felt a sharp pain in my left upper arm			0
' the kicking continued again and i did manage to get back on my hands and knees , but was kicked so that i was left facing underneath the desk to the back wall of the office			1
i heard the door opening and then it was quiet			0
' the second alleged attack happened in the hospital car park when she was tripped and thrown to the floor before being repeatedly beaten and kicked			1
when she was asked to give a full statement on july 19 after the case was passed on to the @entity114 she retracted the allegations			0
sergeant @entity116 of @entity114 , told the panel they decided not to charge the woman with wasting police time after she told them she never intended to make an official complaint			0
she said : ' fairly quickly she said she had been meaning to get in touch with us and the sexual element had not happened			0

once she said this they reported this to the police			0

' she admits lying about the rapes but maintains certain details of the attacks did occur and denies dishonest and misleading conduct			1
and she took the opportunity to apologise to former colleagues in the public gallery saying : ' i apologise for my behaviour to everybody concerned			0
i know it was inappropriate and i 'm glad i had this opportunity to apologise in person			0
