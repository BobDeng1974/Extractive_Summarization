by @entity0 published : 05:06 est , 3 may 2012 updated : 13:39 est , 3 may 2012 @entity3 needs to forget @entity4 and help ' deliver firepower ' for @entity6 and the @entity7 , @entity2 defence secretary @entity1 has said			1
he insisted that @entity9 's largest economy had ample scope to increase its military effectiveness and urged the country to ' pick up the burden ' , despite its historic reluctance to deploy and operate overseas			1
mr @entity1 said that although @entity3 had spent only a little less on defence in absolute terms than @entity18 and @entity2 , the amount was much smaller in proportion to its economy			2
he said : ' due to @entity3 ’s historic reluctance to deploy and operate overseas , i think it is self - evident that there is still huge potential in @entity3 defence structures to deliver more usable firepower to the [ @entity6 ] alliance , ' he said			1
' [ it is about ] a willingness to pick up the burdens that go with having a globally important economy ... @entity3 recognising that it ca n’t continue to be the dominant economy in @entity9 without also significantly increasing its military capability			2
' @entity9 's security and defence needs all the help it can get , with the @entity50 focusing increasingly on the @entity51			1
the @entity50 has long complained that most @entity9 allies , including @entity3 , fail to spend the two per cent of economic output required by @entity6 on defence			1
in @entity9 , only @entity2 , @entity18 , @entity56 and @entity57 meet the target			2
but with @entity3 , @entity2 and much of @entity9 focused on reducing public debt , that is unlikely to change any time soon			0
moving forward : mr @entity1 , second from right , attends a wreath laying ceremony to honour @entity3 soldiers killed in action as he meets mr @entity25 , right , in @entity27 today ' this is not about the budget but about turning the forces it is already paying for into a more deployable , more usable force , ' said mr @entity1			0
he praised the country ’s move to a professional army from one based on conscription and its involvement in overseas @entity6 missions in the @entity76 and @entity77 , where the @entity3 contingent is the third largest after @entity50 and @entity2 forces			1
last year , @entity3 upset its @entity6 allies by abstaining from a @entity83 @entity82 vote authorising military action in @entity85			0
the country also remained firmly on the sidelines during an aerial bombing campaign led by @entity18 and @entity2			0
but mr @entity1 called the @entity85 issue as a ' minor setback ' on the path to what he saw as a more proactive @entity3 , which is moving beyond its @entity94 inhibitions about sending troops overseas			0
he said : ' i detect a determination here that @entity3 ’s role in @entity6 should continue to normalise ... and that it intends to continue to become a more significant player among the nations in protecting our collective security			0
' video : @entity104 met with the @entity6 gen @entity105 this morning to discuss security in @entity77			0

defence secretary says @entity9 's largest economy should do more to assist @entity6
