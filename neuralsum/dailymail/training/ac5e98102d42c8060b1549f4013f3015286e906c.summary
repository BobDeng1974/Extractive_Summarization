why weather the bone - chilling rocky surface of @entity1 when you could call the clouds of @entity6 ' earth - like upper atmosphere home ? that 's the question posed by a @entity9 project that envisions a future where humans might live in solar - powered airships 31 miles above @entity14 's nearest neighbor			1
dubbed the @entity15 ( @entity16 ) the project would first send a robotic scout to gauge the lay of the land ( or clouds ) followed by a 30 - day manned mission in a zeppelin - style helium ship			1
that may sound hot , but at only 17 degrees @entity40 hotter than @entity14 's highest recorded temperature it 's downright cozy compared to the @entity41 on the surface of @entity1			2
that 's at 30 miles above @entity6 only , of course			1
thanks to a greenhouse gas heavy atmosphere , @entity6 is the hottest planet in the solar system with surface temperatures reaching @entity49			2
@entity50 , whose helped dream up the idea with @entity53 at @entity9 's @entity54 and @entity55 at @entity56 in @entity57 , told @entity36 : ' the vast majority of people , when they hear the idea of going to @entity6 and exploring , think of the surface , where it 's hot enough to melt lead and the pressure is the same as if you were almost a mile underneath the ocean @entity14 - like : the ambitious project would take a spacecraft carrying folded up helium airships ( right ) to the planet where surface temperatures reach nearly 900f			1
however , at 31 miles above @entity6 , scientists say the conditions are far more @entity14 - like @entity74 than @entity1 ? scientists at @entity9 say that in some ways a ' landing ' in the atmosphere of @entity6 would be easier than a surface landing on @entity1 nearest neighbor : a manned mission could place two astronauts above he @entity6 surface for 30 - days after a 110 - day trip to @entity14 's nearest neighbor ' i think that not many people have gone and looked at the relatively much more hospitable atmosphere and how you might tackle operating there for a while			1
' once implemented , havoc would begin with an unmanned mission to @entity6 in which a 100 - foot - long robotic solar - powered helium airship would test the waters , so to speak , in the planet 's atmosphere			1
a gondola beneath would contain instruments with which to take measurements of temperature and other factors in preparation for a manned mission			2
if given the go - ahead , that manned mission would take two brave souls on a 110 - day trip to @entity6			1
they would spend a month inside a habitat in a gondola below the airship			0
at the end of the 30 - day mission , the astronauts would ascend back through the atmosphere in a vehicle brought with them for that purpose			2
the trip back would take 300 days , putting the astronauts back on @entity14 after 440 days			0
a very optimistic mission to @entity1 -- which is 33.9 million miles from @entity14 at its closest versus 25 million for @entity6 -- would have astronauts in space a minimum of 500 days for a stay of the same length			1
‘ traditionally , say if you ’re going to @entity1 , you talk about “ entry , descent , and landing , ” or @entity130 , ’ said @entity9 's @entity50			0
' obviously , in our case , ‘ landing ’ would represent a significant failure of the mission , so instead we have ‘ entry , descent , and inflation , ’ or @entity138			0
’ and that 's no easy task			0
inside an ‘ aeroshell ’ the astronauts would enter @entity6 ’ atmosphere at 4,500 miles per second			0
the aeroshell would decelerate to 450 meters per second and deploy a parachute			0
the shell would then fall away , revealing the airship , which would unfurl and inflate while gently positioning itself at 31 miles above the fiery @entity6 surface			0
the next step would be a year - long mission to @entity6 ' atmosphere and then , in the more distant future , a permanent human settlement comprised of a floating city of airships			1
@entity53 says the atmosphere above @entity6 is ' probably the most @entity14 - like environment that ’s out there ' and says its protection from the sun 's radiation makes it almost preferable to @entity1 , which gets 40 times the amount of radiation as @entity14			1
in the @entity6 atmosphere , @entity53 says , you 'd be exposed to ' about the same as if you were in @entity165			2
' for all the obstacles involved in a plan to get to @entity6 , stay a while and then return , @entity53 says it might actually be more practical than a trip to @entity1			0
' @entity6 has value as a destination in and of itself for exploration and colonization , ' there are things that you would need to do for a @entity1 mission , but we see a little easier path through @entity6			0
' @entity181 to bet back : at the end of their mission , the astronauts would ascend back into space in an aircraft they brought along for that purpose			0

the @entity15 program would eventually send a manned mission to the atmosphere of @entity6
around 30 miles above the surface , @entity6 has temperatures and atmospheric pressure *reminiscent* of @entity14 's
a robot would first be sent to the @entity6 ' atmosphere to test the waters -- a two - manned vehicle would follow
the project could one day pave the way toward a floating city above @entity6
