by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor new foreign secretary @entity2 today played down his eurosceptic credentials as he prepared to take charge of efforts to claw powers back from @entity7			1
his surprise promotion from the @entity9 following @entity11 ’s dramatic decision to step down			1
mr @entity2 , who has previously suggested he could back leaving the @entity12 , insisted he was focussed on renegotiating @entity14 's membership and would not ' threaten ' other member states			1
eurosceptic @entity2 becomes foreign secretary , in charge of renegotiating @entity14 's @entity12 membership mr @entity11 , 53 , will remain in the @entity20 as @entity21 until next year ’s general election , when he will step down from @entity23			1
but mr @entity2 's promotion is one of the most striking in @entity27 's reshuffle , coming at such a sensitive time for @entity14 's relations with @entity7			1
the prime minister has promised to renegotiate the @entity14 's membership of the @entity12 , before holding an in - out referendum			1
last year mr @entity2 said he would vote to leave the @entity12 ' if the choice is between a @entity12 written exactly as it is today and not being a part of that '			1
arriving at the @entity36 to start his new job today , he told reporters : ' i 'm going to focus on making sure that we have a successful renegotiation with our @entity43 partners , ' he said			0
' i do n't think the way to enter a negotiation is to start issuing threats			0
' @entity2 is not exciting			2
he does not crack jokes or deliver spine - tingling speeches			0
he is no @entity49 or @entity50			0
the 58 - year - old is a money - man , with the demeanour and precision of an accountant , who has impressed with his grip on the finances at the @entity9			0
the new foreign secretary has a huge task ahead of him			1
with 10 months to go until the general election , he will have to start the process of @entity27 ’s renegotiation of @entity14 ’s membership of the @entity12			1
crucially , @entity2 has said that if powers are not returned , he would vote to leave the @entity12			2
now it is his job to make sure that does not happen			0
he is on the right of the party , having spoken out against gay marriage and defence cuts so vehemently last year he was said to be on ' manoeuvres ' to position himself as an alternative @entity74 leader the son of a civil engineer , he went to @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79 , with tv presenter @entity80 , who once claimed the future @entity74 minister was ‘ a goth back then ’ who ‘ used to arrive in class in a leather trench - coat with @entity85 under his arm ’			1
needless to say , straight - laced @entity2 dismissed it as a wind - up			2
after studying @entity91 at @entity92 – the apprenticeship for most of @entity94 – he joined medical equipment firm @entity95 , where he later became a director			0
he ran his own company and became a director of housebuilder @entity98 , amassing an estimated wealth of more than £ 8million			0
elected as mp for @entity102 and @entity103 in @entity104 in 1997 , he was given his first job on the frontbench a year later by @entity11 , who he now replaces at the @entity36			1
as @entity108 ’s deputy in opposition , @entity2 was expected to join him at the @entity110 if the @entity111 won the 2010 election			1
but coalition meant he was shunted to transport to make way for a @entity115 , and was promoted to @entity116 in 2011 when @entity117 was forced to resign			0
@entity2 ’s ministerial career has often been buffeted by events outside his control			2
now he is one of the great offices of state , life could be about to get a bit ore exciting			0
@entity74 @entity20 veteran @entity50 , who resigned last night after 40 years on the political frontline , took a parting shot at the promotion of eurosceptics like mr @entity2			1
mr @entity50 has vowed to continue to argue @entity14 must remain in the @entity12			1
he told @entity135 's today programme : ' every government in this country is going to want @entity14 to stay in the @entity12 , it is the best way of affecting global political events and boosting our economy , the best way of protecting the interests of our citizens , it 's a globalised world			1
' however , mr @entity11 denied that naming mr @entity2 as his successor marked a more @entity144 approach from the @entity111			1
he said : ' we are very clear and united on @entity43			0
@entity2 , @entity27 and i all have exactly the same policy on @entity43			2
' we want to improve @entity14 's relationship with the @entity12 and then hold a referendum on staying in or leaving the @entity12			1
' we are all committed to that ; the @entity74 is more united on this issue than it has been in the whole time that i have been in politics , in all that long time			0
' we are all going to be campaigning for that and i know @entity2 will be very committed to that			2
' mr @entity11 's decision to quit as foreign secretary marks the beginning of the end of a political career that began in 1977 when , at the age of 16 , he impressed then @entity74 leader @entity163 with an impassioned speech at the @entity74 conference			1
the move comes during a fraught period in foreign affairs when @entity171 and @entity172 are in flames , @entity167 is on the brink , @entity166 is still menacing the @entity175 and mr @entity27 is engaged in a battle to keep @entity14 in a reformed @entity12			1
mr @entity11 faced sharp criticism last month when , at a time of such global instability , he featured in a number of photo opportunities with the @entity183 actress @entity182 , who was visiting the @entity14 for a summit on sexual violence in warfare			1
‘ from may 2015 , after such a long period in politics , i want to embark on many other things i have always wanted to do			0
‘ after the general election , i will return to my writing , while still giving very active support to the @entity74 and campaigning on international causes i believe in			1
’ mr @entity27 paid tribute to the man who led the conservatives during the dark period after the 1997 landslide defeat			0
the prime minister said : ‘ @entity11 has been one of the leading lights of the @entity74 for a generation , leading the party and serving in two cabinets			2
‘ not only has he been a first - class foreign secretary – he has also been a close confidante , a wise counsellor and a great friend			1
‘ he will remain as first secretary of state and my de facto political deputy in the run - up to the election – and it is great to know that he will be a core part of the team working to ensure an outright @entity74 victory at the next election			2
’ mr @entity11 said last night he wanted to pursue other options , including restarting his career as a political biographer			2
he tweeted : ‘ role as @entity220 means i will finish in politics as i began – speaking in @entity23 and campaigning among the voters			2
@entity223 - nobbing : @entity11 faced criticism when he featured in a number of photo opportunities with @entity182 , who was visiting the @entity14 for a summit on sexual violence in warfare with partner @entity231 ( left ) mr @entity11 ’s departure after four years as foreign secretary will rob the @entity74 leadership of one of its most experienced hands			1
he first came to public attention in 1977 when , as a @entity240 schoolboy , he tore into the record of the then @entity243 government			0
the speech , applauded by @entity163 , marked him for greatness and helped fast - track his career			0
