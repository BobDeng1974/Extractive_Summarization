by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor for @entity2 @entity3 is quietly forming a coalition to support airstrikes on @entity6 in @entity7 after the execution of @entity1 journalist @entity9 , according to a report on wednesday			1
@entity3 said tuesday in @entity11 , @entity12 that his defense and @entity14 are ' urging countries in the region and building an international coalition , including our closest allies , to support @entity20 as they take the fight to these barbaric terrorists			1
' he did not specifically mention recruiting partners for bombing raids over @entity7 air space			2
but the @entity27 reported hours later , citing unnamed sources , that the @entity1 was engaged in a ' diplomatic campaign to enlist allies and neighbors in the region to increase their support for @entity7 ’s moderate opposition and , in some cases , to provide support for possible @entity1 military operations			1
the @entity59 this week began facing tough questions about whether it would pursue @entity6 into @entity7 as part of a plan that has so for focused exclusively on hamstringing its fighters in @entity20			1
a knowledgeable @entity46 source would not confirm that any country has been asked to provide materiel , personnel or logistical support for any @entity1 military mission operating in or over @entity7			1
international coalition - building has become the most recognizable hallmark of @entity3 's foreign policy			2
he warned tuesday in his lackluster and sparsely applauded address at the @entity78 's annual convention that ' history teaches us of the dangers of overreaching , and spreading ourselves too thin , and trying to go it alone without international support			0
' ' in times of crisis , ' the president preened , ' no other nation can rally such broad coalitions to stand up for international norms and peace			0
' according to the @entity27 , @entity53 and @entity52 are the most likely nations to step up first , followed by @entity57 , whose military bases near its long @entity7 border would be invaluable for staging , refueling and supplies			1
but @entity3 also branded @entity6 ' a cancer , ' bragging that ' tyrants and murderers before them should recognize that kind of hateful vision ultimately is no match for the strength and hopes of people who stand together for the security and dignity and freedom that is the birthright of every human being			2
' that laid - on - thick rhetoric suggests either a confidence that a coalition will materialize , or a brazen acknowledgment that @entity1 will be left to bomb @entity6 on its own in @entity7 – as it has already in @entity20			1
gen. @entity115 , the chairman of the @entity1 military @entity116 , told reporters on august 21 that @entity6 ' can be contained , ' but ' not in perpetuity			2
' ' this is an organization that has an apocalyptic , end - of - days strategic vision and which will eventually have to be defeated , ' @entity115 said			0
' can they be defeated without addressing that part of their organization which resides in @entity7 ? the answer is no. that will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border			0
' the administration appears to be gearing up for airstrikes , and floated the case of the @entity135 to the @entity27			2
the @entity136 - linked @entity6 ( @entity6 ) operates both in @entity20 and in @entity7 ( shown ) , and moves personnel and materiel freely across the invisible border between the two countries about 12,000 of the @entity142 ethnic group inhabit the @entity20 town of @entity144 , which @entity6 has been attacking for the last two months			1
@entity6 , a @entity145 group , sees the @entity135 as infidels , and its militants have indiscriminately killed countless of them			1
like the @entity148 before them on @entity150			0
@entity152 , the group is a ready - made rationale for @entity1 humanitarian assistance and airborne offensives			0
and according to the @entity156 , between 750,000 and 1.5 million @entity135 live in @entity7			0
a @entity46 source said he could n't reject the possibility that @entity1 airstrikes against @entity6 in @entity7 could be framed as those near @entity150			1
@entity152 were , as an effort to protect an oppressed group			0
the @entity163 has already begun to send surveillance drones on flights over @entity7 to gather intelligence on @entity6 's positions and troop strength			2
@entity169 , @entity7 's strong - arm dictator , has warned that the @entity1 must ask permission before intruding into his country 's airspace for any reason , including strikes against @entity6			1
tensions between @entity176 and @entity177 could worsen if the @entity1 were to insert itself into @entity7			0
while @entity6 has taken up arms against @entity169 in a bloody civil war that has raged since 2011 , so have the @entity135			0
weakening one while strengthening the other is likely not the dictator 's idea of a good outcome			0
but @entity46 spokeswoman @entity185 insisted during a press conference on tuesday that ' we 're not going to ask permission from the @entity7 regime			0

@entity27 report suggests @entity3 wo n't go it alone if he attacks @entity6 inside @entity7 's borders
@entity6 oppression of @entity196 in @entity20 could be a rationale for striking the terror group as it attacks @entity135 in @entity7
@entity53 , @entity52 and @entity57 are mentioned as allies who might ' support ' the @entity59 , but @entity3 has no confirmed takers
there are no direct indications that ' coalition ' partners would actually engage @entity6 from the air along with @entity1
the @entity1 government also wo n't confirm that any nation has agreed to back the @entity59 if @entity3 pursues @entity6 into @entity7
