@entity0 has been roved across , dug into and drilled by various rovers - but so far no machine has delved very deep beneath the surface			1
that 's all set to change in september 2016 , when @entity6 's newest mission to the red planet - insight - will arrive			1
the spacecraft completed a successful @entity9 last friday - and @entity6 and its international partners have now given the go - ahead for construction of the lander			2
@entity6 's @entity15 ( @entity15 ) mission will pierce deep beneath the @entity17 surface to study its interior for the first time			1
the launch is scheduled for march 2016 with arrival at the red planet set for september that year @entity6 ’s @entity15 ( @entity15 ) mission will pierce beneath the @entity17 surface to study its interior			1
the first spacecraft to successfully fly by @entity0 was @entity6 's @entity25 in 1967 , after several failed attempts by the @entity27			1
but the @entity27 's @entity0 probe was the first to successfully land on the surface , on 2 december 1971			2
next , in the latter half of 1976 , @entity6 's @entity31 landers touched down on the surface and performed the first search for life on @entity0 - with results being inconclusive			1
the first rover on @entity0 was @entity38 , carried by @entity39 , which landed on 27 september 1997			2
this was followed by the hugely successful @entity44 rovers in 2004 , the latter of which is still operational today			0
@entity6 's curiosity rover is also still currently hard at work on the surface			1
later this year two new orbiting spacecraft will arrive at @entity0 , @entity50 's @entity49 ( their first mission to @entity0 ) and @entity6 's @entity53			1
after insight in 2016 , @entity54 will land a rover called @entity57 on the surface in 2018			0
this will be followed by an as yet unnamed @entity6 rover similar to @entity61 but with different instruments in 2020			0
the mission will investigate how terrestrial rocky planets like @entity65 formed and developed their layered inner structure of core , mantle and crust			2
it will also collect information about those interior zones using instruments that have never been used before on @entity0			2
@entity15 will launch from @entity74 , on the central @entity76 coast near @entity77 , in march 2016			1
this will be the first interplanetary mission ever to launch from @entity76			0
the mission will help inform the agency ’s goal of sending a human mission to @entity0 in the 2030s			0
@entity15 team leaders presented mission - design results last week to a @entity6 review board , which approved advancing to the next stage of preparation			1
the next step will be to begin integrating the various bits of hardware with computer systems , which will begin in november			0
' we now move from doing the design and analysis to building and testing the hardware and software that will get us to @entity0 and collect the science that we need to achieve mission success , ' said @entity101 , insight project manager at @entity6 's @entity103 ( @entity103 ) in @entity104 , @entity76 , in a release statement			1
scientists think that by studying the interior of @entity0 ( shown in this illustration ) they will have a better understanding of how terrestrial rocky plants like @entity65 can form			1
@entity15 will be capable of drilling up to 15 feet ( 4.5 metres ) beneath the surface and could provide this information to investigate the planet 's interior , the stationary lander will carry a robotic arm that will deploy surface and burrowing instruments contributed by @entity120 and @entity121			1
the national space agencies of @entity120 and @entity121 - @entity123 ( @entity123 ) and @entity124 ( @entity124 ) - are partnering with @entity6 by providing @entity15 's two main science instruments			1
the @entity126 ( @entity126 ) will be built by @entity123 in partnership with @entity124 and the space agencies of @entity129 and the @entity130			0
it will measure waves of ground motion carried through the interior of the planet , from ' marsquakes ' and meteor impacts			0
the @entity138 and @entity139 , from @entity124 , will measure heat coming toward the surface from the planet 's interior			0
' @entity0 actually offers an advantage over @entity65 itself for understanding how habitable planetary surfaces can form , ' said @entity145 , insight principal investigator from @entity103			0
' both planets underwent the same early processes			0
but @entity0 , being smaller , cooled faster and became less active while @entity65 kept churning			0
' so @entity0 better preserves the evidence about the early stages of rocky planets ' development			2
' @entity15 will have a number of instruments designed by agencies across the globe			0
@entity121 and @entity120 , for example , will be helping to design a seismic experiment that can measure waves of ground motion carried through the interior of the planet the three - legged @entity15 lander will go to a site near the @entity17 equator and provide information for a planned mission length of 720 days - about two years			1
@entity15 adapts a design from the successful @entity169 , which examined ice and soil on far - northern @entity0 in 2008			2
' we will incorporate many features from our @entity175 spacecraft into @entity15 , but the differences between the missions require some differences in the @entity15 spacecraft , ' said insight program manager @entity180 of @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183			0
' for example , the insight mission duration is 630 days longer than @entity175 , which means the lander will have to endure a wider range of environmental conditions on the surface			0
' guided by images of the surroundings taken by the lander , @entity15 's robotic arm will place the seismometer on the surface and then place a protective covering over it to minimize effects of wind and temperature on the sensitive instrument			2
the arm will also put the heat - flow probe in position to hammer itself into the ground to a depth of 9 to 15 feet ( 2.7 to 4.5 metres )			0
another experiment will use the radio link between @entity15 and @entity6 's @entity209 antennas on @entity65 to precisely measure a wobble in @entity0 ' rotation that could reveal whether it has a molten or solid core			1
wind and temperature sensors from @entity217 's @entity216 and a pressure sensor will monitor weather at the landing site , and a magnetometer will measure magnetic disturbances caused by the @entity17 ionosphere .			0

construction of @entity6 's next mission to @entity0 , @entity15 , has been approved
the mission will launch in march 2016 and arrive in september 2016
it will be the first lander to drill deep beneath the surface of @entity0
this will provide information on how rocky terrestrial planets form
the mission is a global endeavour *including* input from the @entity130 and @entity120
