@entity16 are on the verge of signing convicted rapist @entity2 ( pictured in @entity18 on sunday ) @entity19 striker @entity2 is without a club after being released from prison in october @entity2 could be in line for a return to football after it was announced a @entity27 club could sign him the developments represent a dramatic u-turn by @entity30 , who insisted they had no intention of landing the 26 - year - old last month			1
a statement on december 1 read : ' the board of directors would like to confirm that we will not be extending an invitation for @entity2 to train with @entity0 nor will we be offering him a contract			1
' the club will not be making any further comment on this subject			2
' senior officials at the club are known to believe @entity2 ' side of the story			1
they spoke to the player in late november but decided against making a move amid fears it would further tarnish the club 's image following the signing of @entity52 in 2007			2
@entity52 had served half of a six - year sentence for causing death by dangerous driving			0
director @entity57 , a former police officer instrumental in bringing @entity52 to @entity58 , is understood to have been heavily involved in this deal			2
@entity58 offered @entity52 a way back into football in 2007 after he had served three years in prison @entity52 played for @entity58 for two years , scoring 25 league goals during his time at the club since defeating @entity67 3 - 0 on november 29 @entity58 's season has suffered a dramatic downturn			1
@entity70 's side have lost four games in a row including a 4 - 0 home humbling by his dad 's @entity74 and a 7 - 0 drubbing at @entity77			0
@entity2 served two - and - a - half years of a five - year sentence after being found guilty of raping a 19 - year - old woman in 2011			2
@entity81 chief executive @entity80 said there would be a press conference at an unnamed @entity27 club , but @entity5 understands there is n't one planned			1
' the club are due to hold the press conference tomorrow and i 've made it clear to them that i can not attend tomorrow , ' he told @entity93 's @entity92 programme			0
according to one board member of @entity58 , the official club supporters trust that has a stake in the club and even provides financial support that can extend to the payment of a player ’s wages , they have not been consulted about the possible recruitment of @entity2			1
@entity104 told @entity5 he knew nothing of @entity2 joining the club			1
speaking personally and not on behalf of @entity58 , he did however argue that – having served his sentence for rape – @entity2 was entitled to return to work as a footballer			2
' we have n’t discussed it , ’ said mr @entity104			0
' but speaking personally i ’m of the opinion that if he has served his sentence we ca n’t keep going on about it			0
i understand the emotional point , but taking that aside he ’s now entitled to play football again			0
' @entity120 side @entity119 announced on friday that they had offered the 26 - year - old striker a deal for the remainder of the season , but that move was blocked by the @entity126 as @entity2 is not allowed to work abroad			1
he was initially given permission by @entity7 to return to train with the club at the request of players union the @entity81			0
but following a backlash from supporters , sponsors and patrons - with 160,000 people signing a petition opposing his return - the club retracted the offer			0
@entity80 warned that any move for the 26 - year - old striker had to be for the right reasons			0
@entity2 ' attempts to return have so far been fruitless , with clubs turning down the chance to employ him ' bearing in mind what happened with his release and then of course the furore that we had at @entity7 we feel that any club wishing to sign him needs to be 100 per cent committed to signing him for proper and legitimate football reasons , ' @entity80 added			1
any move to sign @entity2 is likely to lead to public outcry , but @entity80 is keen to avoid a similar situation to the one that engulfed @entity7 after they made their offer to the player			1
' i do n't want to create a replica - type situation that we had at @entity164 ( @entity7 ) because i 'm a little bit concerned that we need press conference and that will invite , of course , many antagonists , ' he said			0
@entity80 said the @entity81 appreciated the situation was ' very sensitive ' , but reiterated its stance that @entity2 deserved the chance to resume his career following his release from prison			2
' we 've made it clear in our statements that we feel he 's been unable to say much because of the appeals process , but he has served his time and the job of society is to look to rehabilitate , ' @entity80 said			0
the @entity184 international 's most recent set - back came this weekend , when a move to @entity120 was blocked on friday @entity120 side @entity119 revealed that they had made a contract offer to @entity2 for the remainder of the season , although the @entity93 quoted a spokesman for @entity2 denying the player received such an offer			1
however , any move abroad is unlikely to materialise given the @entity194 's tough regime in managing sex offenders			0
a @entity126 spokesman said : ' we are determined to have one of the toughest regimes in the world for managing sex offenders , to stop them re-offending and to protect victims			2
' probation officers must give permission for sex offenders on licence to take up new jobs and this includes ensuring they hold regular face to face meetings - this effectively rules out working abroad			0
' the offenders will also be subject to strict conditions such as exclusion zones , non-contact orders and having to attend sex offender treatment programmes			0
' @entity58 declined to comment .			0

@entity0 , currently 14th in @entity27 , are set to sign @entity2
