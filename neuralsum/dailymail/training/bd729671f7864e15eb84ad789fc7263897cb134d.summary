in fact , nearly all the electricity at the historic castle is now being generated at a mini power station on a lock on the @entity9			1
after a series of trials earlier this year , a deal to provide the green electricity has started , and two giant water turbines have been installed at @entity15 on the river at @entity2 to generate the power			1
the @entity0 is the only customer and at times the generators produce so much energy that it is passed on from the castle to the rest of the town			1
@entity24 , managing director of @entity25 , which installed the turbines , signed a 15 - year deal with the @entity29			1
‘ i was in wellies and could n’t go into @entity31 , so i signed it on the marble handrail of a fountain in the grounds , ’ he says			1
‘ fifteen years is a long time for a power contract			1
but it works as security for us and also for the @entity29			1
‘ the turbines produce 2 million kwh per year , which is enough to power 400 houses — or one big castle			1

‘ the project is still in its infancy , so it is too early to assess the size of the carbon emissions saved			1

@entity159 , 25 , the daredevil daughter of @entity169 , joined a sea of runners as they sprinted ahead of a herd of angry bulls through the cobbled streets of the city during the @entity176			2
‘ it was so scary , ’ says willowy @entity159 , who is also the girlfriend of former matador - turned - writer @entity160 , 11 years her senior			2
even a stiff drink after the adrenaline - fuelled event could n’t calm her nerves			2
‘ @entity183 is a must , although i felt sick afterwards , considering it was 8.30am , ’ she says			0
