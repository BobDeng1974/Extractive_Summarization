by @entity0 boost : @entity1 appears to have backed @entity3 's idea for a ' two - speed ' @entity4 @entity3 ’s bid to cut a new deal for @entity7 with @entity8 received a major boost yesterday when @entity1 publicly backed the idea of a ‘ two - speed @entity4 ’			1
in a significant step , the powerful @entity1 finance minister @entity11 said he accepted @entity7 demands that @entity15 countries outside the @entity16 would need special protections in future			1
‘ as long as the @entity7 will not join the @entity16 , maybe we can find a two - state solution , ’ he said			2
in a joint article with the chancellor @entity22 , mr @entity11 spelled out @entity1 ’s vision of how @entity16 countries could pursue deeper political and monetary union , while ensuring ‘ fairness ’ for @entity15 countries like @entity7 that remain outside			1
@entity28 welcomed his intervention , saying it showed @entity1 had accepted that the @entity7 and other states outside the euro needed special protections written into the @entity15 treaties rather than fighting their corner on a case - by - case basis			1
@entity1 is pushing for closer union within the @entity16 to prevent a repeat of the crisis that nearly destroyed the single currency			1
but @entity7 ministers warn they are already engaged in hand to hand combat in @entity8 to protect key @entity7 interests in areas like regulation of the @entity47			0
they fear that strengthening the @entity16 would create a powerful voting bloc that would leave the @entity7 at a permanent disadvantage			2
ministers now hope that mr @entity11 ’s words could eventually lead to a wider change to qualified majority voting , in which changes would have to be agreed by a majority of non-euro states , as well as by those in the euro			0
but the plan still faces major hurdles , with @entity60 resistant to a major shake - up in the @entity15 ’s treaties , particularly if it would benefit @entity7			2
in their article in the @entity65 yesterday , mr @entity11 and mr @entity22 said any changes to @entity15 treaties must ‘ guarantee fairness ’ for member states outside the euro			0
they wrote : ‘ the @entity7 fully recognises the progress made so far in responding to the crisis , and it supports the case for further steps forward			0
but as the euro area continues to integrate , it is important that countries outside the euro area are not at a systematic disadvantage in the @entity15 , ” they wrote			0
‘ so future @entity15 reform and treaty change must include reform of the governance framework to put euro area integration on a sound legal basis , and guarantee fairness for those @entity15 countries inside the single market but outside the single currency			2
’ in a joint article with the chancellor @entity22 , @entity1 finance minister @entity11 said he accepted @entity7 demands that @entity15 countries outside the @entity16 would need special protections in future @entity28 welcomed the shift from @entity98			1
a spokesman said : what we see is @entity1 , one of the leading players in the eurozone , accepting that there needs to be these proper safeguards put in place as further changes are made for the eurozone			0
' that is one of the important reforms we want to see to the @entity15			0
’ asked whether the development meant it would be easier for mr @entity3 to achieve his plans for a renegotiation followed by a referendum by 2017 , the spokesman said : ‘ there are a number of reforms we would like to see to the @entity15 , but making sure that the @entity7 and other countries outside the eurozone remain on a level playing field is vitally important			1
’ but some @entity126 mps - and many members of the public - remain sceptical about mr @entity3 ’s chances of achieving major reform before holding a promised in / out referendum in 2017			0
a major poll conducted for the former @entity126 treasurer lord @entity132 yesterday revealed that only one in five voters is confident the prime minister can secure a good deal			0
@entity126 mp @entity137 welcomed the close - co - operation between mr @entity22 and his @entity1 counterpart , but warned : ‘ the @entity1 are n’t going to remake the @entity15 to suit the @entity7 and even the prospect of treaty change seems to be receding			1
’ fellow @entity143 @entity142 said it was ‘ just like the 1990s all over again ’ , when @entity8 paid lip service to @entity7 demands for more powers to be handed back to national parliaments .			2
