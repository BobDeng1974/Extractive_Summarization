scientists say that cetecean morbillivirus is the cause for nine times the usual number of bottlenose dolphins stranding on shores between @entity15 and @entity16 since the beginning of july			1
most are dead by the time they reach the shore with many already decomposed and more than half of the deaths occuring in @entity24			1
deadly : @entity26 members @entity27 ( left ) of @entity28 , @entity24 , and intern @entity29 examine a dead male dolphin that was washed up on the beach , one of 330 killed by a measles - like virus investigation : @entity39 , from the @entity37 in @entity38 , photographs a dead dolphin that washed ashore in @entity41 on wednesday dolphins infected by the virus typically suffer symptoms such as skin lesions , brain infections and pneumonia			1
the virus is usually spread through inhalation of respiratory particles or direct contact between animals			0
officials confirmed that there 's no risk of the virus being caught by humans			2
@entity58 of the @entity59 described the number of dolphin deaths as ' extraordinary '			2
the @entity59 announced earlier this month that the number of dolphins dying this year is above average and devoted extra resources to trying find the cause			2
it had suspected that the virus was behind the extra deaths and has now confirmed it as the ' tentative cause ' with research ongoing			0
record : this picture shows an identification tag - the equivalent of a dolphin toe tag - for a dolphin that had died on the @entity41 beach , @entity38 examination : equipment is ready to perform a necropsy on a dead dolphin at the @entity82 , in @entity28 officials believe that many more dolphins may have succumbed to morbillivirus but have n't washed ashore			1
the virus , which affects a broad range of mammals , was the cause of some 740 dolphin deaths between @entity38 and @entity90 in 1987 and 1988			0
the disease is expected to spread south and to last until next spring			0
eventually , dolphins will build up a resistance to the disease as they have been known to with similar strains in the past			2
a new generation of dolphins could become susceptible to the disease again in the future however			0
there are two different stocks of dolphins that populate the affected region , with the northern stock having between 7,000 and 9,000 dolphins , while the southern stock has between 9,900 to 12,000 dolphins , according to federal estimates			0
bottlenose dolphins are typically found in groups of two to 15 and live for between 40 and 50 years			0
