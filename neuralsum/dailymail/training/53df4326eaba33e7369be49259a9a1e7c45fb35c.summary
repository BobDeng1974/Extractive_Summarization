@entity0 was in retreat last night over its instruction to @entity3 to give prisoners the vote as @entity6 threatened to walk away from the institution			1
the @entity8 expressed ‘ profound concern and disappointment ’ that ministers had ignored its repeated demands to allow convicts to take part in elections			1
but instead of threatening the @entity3 with legal action , the council booted the issue into the long grass until september 2015 – after @entity3 ’s general election			1
@entity21 , who served 25 years in jail for murdering his landlady with an axe , says @entity3 is wrongly denying prisoners a vote in may 's general election mps said @entity0 had been spooked by @entity30 threats to leave the court ’s jurisdiction if it continued to ride roughshod over the will of @entity34 they believe the @entity35 , which oversees the court and is in charge of ensuring its verdicts are upheld , is quietly backing down because it does not want to inflame the row further			1
@entity30 @entity41 said : ‘ this just shows @entity3 can defend its democratic rights in the face of the arbitrary meddling of the @entity0 court without facing fines , compensation awards or anything more than the mildest diplomatic ruffling of feathers			2
’ @entity3 ministers have repeatedly expressed their anger at the court ’s decision in 2005 to give inmates the vote			1
home secretary @entity59 and justice secretary @entity60 have both made it clear that if the court does not change , the @entity3 must be ready to leave			2
@entity30 proposals to reassert the sovereignty of @entity34 over the court will be included in the party ’s election manifesto			2
these are likely to be backed by a formal threat to quit			0
mps said @entity0 had been spooked by @entity30 threats to leave the court ’s jurisdiction if it continued to ride roughshod over the will of @entity34 since ministers began talking tough , @entity0 ’s stance has changed markedly			0
last month , the court lifted the threat of a multi-million - pound compensation bandwagon for inmates who have been waiting to vote			1
it held to its condemnation of the centuries - old @entity3 practice , despite the dissenting opinion of two of the judges , who said that the court ’s thinking was a mess and that there was nothing wrong with the law in @entity3			0
the prisoner who won the original @entity95 court ruling was @entity21 , who killed his landlady with an axe in @entity98 , @entity99 , in 1979			1
@entity21 , who served 25 years behind bars , has continued his campaign despite being freed in 2004			1
but the judges said there would be no compensation payment for any of the ten @entity106 prisoners who lodged test cases			0
they said the satisfaction of knowing the court had upheld their complaint was enough			0
@entity30 @entity70 are likely to point to the change in @entity0 ’s position as evidence of what can be achieved if a @entity116 institution takes @entity3 ’s threat to leave seriously			2
@entity118 is under pressure to make a similar commitment that , if he can not secure significant reform from @entity122 , he is prepared to campaign for a so - called @entity123 – or @entity3 exit			0
however , in a sign of mounting tensions within the party , @entity125 last night warned fellow @entity6 to stop saying they would vote to leave the @entity130			0
the former party leader urged colleagues not to get ‘ distracted ’ by banging the drum for leaving but simply concentrate on promising voters a referendum			0
mr @entity118 has promised an in - out vote on @entity3 ’s membership in 2017 if the @entity6 win the general election in may			1
@entity139 and the @entity140 do not support a referendum			0
the prime minister has said that if his party wins , he will spend two years negotiating with other @entity116 countries to get a better deal for @entity3 and would then campaign to stay in the @entity130			1
but several @entity30 backbenchers plan to tell constituents they will vote to leave @entity116			2
mp @entity148 said this month : ‘ my election manifesto will confirm my view that we should leave the @entity130			0
