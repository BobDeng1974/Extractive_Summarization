by @entity0 @entity1 has advised incoming @entity3 manager @entity2 to retain the influence of the @entity5 when he takes over			1
@entity1 , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 face uncertain futures at @entity10 with @entity12 ’s appointment expected to be announced this week			1
though @entity1 is in no rush to sort out his own situation — he would prefer to spend his summer holiday before deciding whether he wants to continue playing — he thinks @entity3 would be better off keeping at least some of their famous old boys around			1
‘ with what the lads bring , and knowing the culture and history of the club and how it ’s run , it can certainly be a plus			2
but ultimately it is down to the new manager			2
it ’s a decision for him to consider			0
’ @entity3 ’s board will let @entity12 choose whether to keep the class of 92 on board			1
sir @entity42 was keen on their involvement and appointed @entity6 as reserve - team manager before he retired			1
his successor @entity46 brought ex-united favourite @entity47 back to the club as a coach and put @entity1 on the staff as well , even though he continued to play			2
when @entity1 became interim manager , he asked @entity8 to help , too , and the quartet of @entity54 players will be in the dugout for sunday 's final game of the season at @entity58			1
but retaining them is a risk for @entity12			2
as @entity46 found out , they exert a powerful influence on the club and the @entity64 could come under pressure from fans if he loses games while @entity1 is standing on the sidelines			1
helping hand : @entity1 ( right ) insists the class of 92 , including @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 , can aid @entity12 @entity1 will consider becoming a manager elsewhere if he is not offered a playing contract and talks with @entity12 about staying on the coaching staff do not go well			1
‘ i honestly do n’t know what i ’ll do next season			2
it ’s something i have n’t experienced before and i ’ll go away , chill out and make a decision , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m lucky that i have a lot of options			0
' if you really think about it , it could be a sad time but also an exciting time as well			0
over the last couple of years i ’ve had inquiries to go somewhere			0
but not in the past couple of weeks			0
‘ i ’m open to so many things but i ’ve got to seriously think about it , and that ’s what i ’ll do — whether to still play , whether to stay here , whether to go somewhere else , whether to chill out for a year and take a step back , as i ’ve been in football since i left school			0
‘ managing another club would be strange but i ’ve got a little taste of management now and what i ’ve been through in the last couple of weeks is a pretty good apprenticeship			0
i ’m around next week and go away on friday			0
it ’s around that time when i ’ll start thinking about it			0
‘ i could get pushed next week on telling them what i want to do but from my side i ’m not in a rush			0
’ do n't go ! fans hold up a banner begging their beloved player / manager not to retire at the end of the season @entity12 ’s arrival will mark the end of an era at @entity3 after 28 years of @entity42 , his ‘ @entity115 and @entity1			1
the @entity64 has no previous @entity117 experience and @entity1 said : ‘ when it ’s pre-season and there is a new manager , different methods and something you ’re not used to , maybe it will be strange			1
’ @entity1 ’s reluctance to rush into a decision is taken on the advice of @entity42 , who thinks you act with a clearer mind after a post-season holiday rather than in may when you are exhausted from a long season			1
@entity12 may be presented this week so he can then concentrate on taking @entity133 to the @entity134			2
he will get funds to revamp the squad and has been linked with his former @entity139 stars @entity137 and @entity140 , as well as @entity58 ’s @entity141 and @entity143 striker @entity142			0
all smiles : interim manager @entity1 has said that @entity3 main aim remains getting into @entity146			1
