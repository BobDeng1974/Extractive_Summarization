by @entity1 reporter last updated at 11:51 pm on 21st october 2011 no love for familiarity : judge @entity4 has been accused of discrimination to most in the county , it is a term of endearment			1
but one @entity11 judge takes such offence at the use of the word ' love ' as a term of address , he has banned it from his courtroom			1
@entity20 @entity19 judge @entity4 has ruled that defendants should no longer be permitted to reply ' yes , love ' when confirming their details with the court clerk or legal adviser			1
instead , they have been ordered to answer : ' yes , ma'am			2
' judge @entity4 claims the word ' love ' is ' disrespectful ' and has ordered all defendants in his court to abide by the new rules			1
the district judge imposed the ban after his legal adviser @entity32 asked a 42 - year - old defendant if he would confirm his identity during a recent hearing and got the reply : ‘ yes , love			2
’ the man , who was on remand and appearing on a video link , was later freed from custody on conditional bail			0
judge @entity4 , 64 , said courts ‘ have to maintain proper standards ’ , adding : ‘ courts are solemn places and serious			2
' they are not places for chatty discussions			0
’ but regional campaign groups condemned the move			0
@entity52 , from the @entity53 , said : ‘ the judge is , himself , being discriminatory in insisting on @entity56 usage over traditional @entity11 dialect			1
' @entity58 ' is a non-sexual term which has been and is used by people of both genders to people of both genders			2
it is a term of endearment			0
love - free zone : from now on , defendants appearing at @entity68 , above , are to address female court staff as ' ma'am ' ' the key issue regarding the current case is if the usage is patronising and that is a value judgement not susceptible to objective proof			1
' if it is not used patronisingly then the judge , himself , is in error			2
if the plaintiff were to arraign the judge for linguistic discrimination , i feel he would have a strong case			0
' @entity85 , from the @entity86 , an organisation which encourages business and all things @entity11 , added : ' i think that you 've got to be careful that you do n't lose the affectionate terms that we use for each other as part of our regional dialects			1
' if the term is used in the right way i see nothing wrong with it , in other parts of the country i believe they refer to one another as " duck " , are we going to stop that as well ? ' defending against the cries of foul against the @entity11 dialect the @entity105 on behalf of judge @entity4 said : ' he simply asked the defendant to observe ordinary courtesy and respect towards an officer of the court			1
' and that the standards demanded upon this occasion were no different to those applied in every other court in the land on every day upon which they sit			0
' @entity118 : a favourite in the north west of the country @entity122 : originally used in @entity123 but now also used in parts of @entity125 our kid : often used to refer to a brother or close friend in @entity130 @entity131 : meaning ' baby ' or ' friend ' and originated in @entity133 my lover : another term originating from @entity133 but is now heard throughout the south west of the country @entity139 : out of date , but can occasionally still be heard in the @entity141 old bean : originating in the south east , this is a jocular form of addressing a man , dating from the 1910s			0
@entity147 : out - and - out @entity148			0
used by men to describe women , derived from the ' treacle tart ' rhyming slang meaning of sweetheart			0
@entity154 : used in the south east as slang for man , but it actually dates from the 15th century word for actor - which was ' guiser ' @entity162 : the popular @entity164 expression for women , originates from the notion that pets need looking after @entity168 : another term for women , which can be heard all over the @entity171 hen : @entity173 slang for woman or girl doll : an affectionate term for women , used by men in @entity173 @entity179 : the tables turn with this term , for it is mainly used by women about men in the @entity171			0
@entity185 : term for a young woman or girl , widely used across @entity11 flower : another well - used phrase in @entity11 - again for women @entity192 : a variation on the word ' babe ' and used to greet @entity197 women @entity198 : heard in @entity199 , but dates back to the 1500s when @entity201 used the phrase ' dainty duck ' for sweetheart .			1

defendants must now call women ' ma'am '
dialect group claim judge discriminates against people from @entity11
