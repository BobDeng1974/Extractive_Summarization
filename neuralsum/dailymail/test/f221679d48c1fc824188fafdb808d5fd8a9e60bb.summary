an aviation expert has questioned whether the doomed @entity2 passenger plane may had its electronics ' hacked ' before it crashed killing all 150 on board			1
the theory has surfaced in a letter to the respected @entity8 newspaper from aviation boss @entity9 , president of @entity11 - based @entity10			1
the @entity13 tragedy which occurred on the flight between @entity15 to @entity16 has been widely blamed on co-pilot @entity17 , 28			1
he is believed to have barricaded himself in the cockpit of the @entity19 before flying the packed plane into the mountainside as the captain fought desperately to get inside			0
mr @entity9 says the @entity13 accident investigators are clear that the stricken plane ' accelerated in its descent '			2
but he writes in the ft : ' that may be , but it could be from any number of causes , including external electronic hacking into the aircraft 's control and navigation systems through malware or electromagnetic interception			1
' ' this is one reason military and head - of - state aircraft are generally installed with specific shielding and additional active protective measures , ' and he stresses : ' civilian aircraft are not			0
' mr @entity9 says the public should reserve final judgment until the investigators have completed their enquiries and come to a firm conclusion			1
he added : ' the public should patiently wait for a through , multi-party professional air safety investigation , while maintaining an independence of judgment over preliminary official hypotheses			0
' setting out his doubts about jumping to conclusions based on preliminary findings , mr @entity9 said : ' both the cockpit voice recorder ( @entity80 ) and the flight data recorder ( @entity80 ) of the @entity2 flight 9525 have yet to be subject to international standards			2
' until they are , many broad assertions currently presented to the public may turn out to be erroneous , misleading or in some cases lead to improper or counterproductive regulatory and other reactions – including misplaced liability , financial and insurance claims			0
' damaged : despite revelations from the plane 's flight data recorders ( pictured ) , mr @entity9 says the public should reserve final judgment until the investigators have completed their enquiries aftermath : he claims passenger planes do not have the same level of protection as military jets and someone could have hacked into its ' control and navigation systems through malware or electromagnetic interception ' since the crash , @entity109 air safety chiefs have recommended that two people must remain at all times on the flight deck , requiring a member of cabin crew to step in if one of the two pilots leaves the cockpit			1
mr @entity9 writes in the ft that the ' slow drip ' of piecemeal judgments from preliminary assessments of data can be counterproductive			2
he said the @entity123 representing nearly 40,000 professional pilots ' has rightly criticised the premature release ' of the aircraft 's cockpit voice recorder			0
investigators say this highlights the co-pilot breathing while locked in the cockpit while the pilot beats on the door outside			2
protection : since the crash which is believed to be caused by 28 - year - old co-pilot @entity17 ( pictured ) , @entity109 air safety chiefs have recommended that two people must remain at all times on the flight deck police carried out forensic searches on @entity17 's and his parents house after it emerged that he ' deliberately ' crashed the @entity143 jet into the @entity13 he believes premature release ' could arguably prejudice a formal technical assessment ' and mr @entity9 is not the only aviation expert to speculate on the plane being ' hacked '			1
former commercial pilot @entity148 told @entity150 television channel @entity149 last month : ' this aircraft is highly computerised			0
' there 's one possibility that no - one has brought up			0
i wonder – could this be a hacking incident ? ' he drew parallels with the loss of a @entity150 drone over @entity160 , which some blamed on electronic hacking : ' suddenly the aircraft responding to outside forces			1
' if something like that were going on it would be very disturbing for the pilot			0

' electronic hacking ' could have caused the air disaster , aviation boss says
@entity2 tragedy has been widely blamed on co-pilot @entity17
but @entity9 says investigators have yet to come to a final conclusion
says passenger planes do not have same level of protection as military jets
