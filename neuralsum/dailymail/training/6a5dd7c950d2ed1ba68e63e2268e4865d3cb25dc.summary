staring back at her was an exotic spider , believed to have travelled more than 6,000 miles from @entity7 in a box of grapes			1
@entity10 , 52 , screamed when she saw the two - inch female @entity7 wolf spider , which experts believe is pregnant , in the fridge at her home in @entity15 , @entity16 in @entity17			1
friend in the fridge : @entity10 found this @entity7 wolf spider in her fridge			1
experts believe the female spider is likely to be pregnant and travelled more than 6,000 miles from @entity7 her husband @entity24 , 60 , rushed downstairs and caught the spider , capable of giving a nasty bite , in a glass before calling the @entity29 ( @entity29 )			1
the female spider is now living at the @entity31			1
mr @entity24 , a former schoolteacher , said : ' i heard my wife screaming and when i went to see what was wrong i discovered the spider sitting on the wall of the fridge			1
it was odd looking and i immediately knew it was n't a normal house spider			1
‘ i think being in the cold had slowed it down as it was n't moving very quickly and was relatively easy to catch			1
‘ i thought it would jump at first , but it was quite lethargic from being in the fridge			1
' i 'm really glad the spider has found a new home as it 's certainly been through quite a journey , wherever it came from			2
' shock discovery : @entity10 ( left ) screamed when she saw the exotic spider in the fridge starring back at her and after rushing to her aid , husband @entity55 ( right ) caught it in before calling the @entity29 mrs @entity10 , a co-ordinator with @entity16 said : ‘ i got a huge shock			2
i think all of @entity15 heard me screaming			0
‘ it was 11pm and @entity55 was feeling peckish so i went to the fridge to get bread and butter for toast			0
‘ as soon as the light went on i saw this hairy spider staring back at me			2
it looked enormous to me and i just started screaming			0
‘ it was like no spider i ’d seen before as it was hairy and had big beady eyes , like a tarantula			2
but i did n’t want to squash it			0
i do n’t like to kill anything but it would also have made a horrible mess of my fridge			0
’ @entity29 animal rescue officer @entity75 said : ' the spider was found in the fridge , next to a box of grapes which originated from @entity7 , so the chances are it has come home in the @entity24 's shopping			1
' @entity84 , general manager of @entity31 said : ‘ we think the spider could be pregnant			2
‘ it is hard to tell with a small spider , but we are pretty sure it is			2
’ @entity90 , from @entity31 , said : ‘ this spider is n't deadly but if ( someone was ) bitten , it would leave a real sting			0
‘ although it 's not much bigger than the average house spider , it definitely is n't from @entity96			0
‘ it has different markings and , unlike house spiders , its eyes are at the front of its head , helping it to hunt and escape danger			0
’ found all over the world , wolf spiders venom is not deadly to humans but can cause mild pain and swelling			0
while the wolf spider has a lifespan of no more than two or three years , it is hoped that the new female will contribute to a new generation of the spiders at the centre			1
mr @entity118 said : ‘ we think we will have this spider for maybe 12 to 18 months , but hopefully we will keep the offspring and have another generation			0
’ anyone who finds an exotic creature such as this should call the @entity126 on 03000 999 999			0
growing family : the wolf spider is now living at the @entity31 ( pictured ) and it is hoped that it will contribute to a new generation of spiders at the centre			1
