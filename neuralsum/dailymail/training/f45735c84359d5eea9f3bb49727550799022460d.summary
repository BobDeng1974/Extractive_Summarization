the son of a 7/7 victim whose mother stole his £ 50,000 compensation says he has no sympathy for her as she is jailed for 30 months			1
@entity6 , who was 11 when his father @entity7 was killed in the terrorist attack , entrusted the sum to his mother @entity10 for safe keeping on his 18th birthday			1
after blowing the money on seven chihuahuas , new cars and expensive dinners at @entity18 , the 42 - year - old widow was told to reimburse her son in civil court			1
having failed to repay the money , she was jailed after being found guilty of theft at @entity23 , and imprisoned for 30 months			1
' to be honest , based upon how she has approached this whole situation , i feel like she has brought this upon herself and i do n’t have any sympathy , ' he said			1
' it was even stated that she showed no emotion in the court room			0
even now , she ’s shown no remorse and continues to try and play the victim and manipulate everyone around her			0
' @entity23 @entity23 heard how following his father 's death in 2005 , mr @entity6 was awarded £ 50,000 and his sister £ 100,000 in compensation by the @entity54			1
the money was placed in a trust fund until their 18th birthdays			0
but after turning 18 , mr @entity6 entrusted the money to his mother for safe keeping , worried he was not responsible enough at the time to handle such a large sum			1
when he asked for access to it in 2013 to move to @entity65 from @entity23 , @entity66 , he was told it was all but gone - his mother having already spent the £ 250,000 given to her separately			1
while mr @entity6 said he ' should not have had ' to go to such extreme lengths , he is hopeful a prison stint will make his mother feel remorse			1
' i do n’t think she ’ll cope very well in prison , i think it ’ll be hard for her			0
' she ’s in a situation where she ’ll have to tell everyone inside what she ’s done			0
it ’s not going to be a holiday for her			0
' she ’ll have to say that she stole her son ’s money and the chances are the other inmates will be mothers			0
grieving : @entity88 ( right with her daughter @entity87 , now 16 ) met the @entity89 at a memorial service in 2005 ' i do n’t think this is going to be an easy time for her			2
i ’m not sure if i ’m going to visit her or not			0
' part of me hopes that she might actually learn from this experience but i do n’t want to get my hopes up as so far she ’s shown no remorse			0
' i lost my dad as a young child , and now i ’ve lost my mum			0
' in court the woman 's behaviour was described as ' an act of wickedness beyond belief			2
' @entity110 , judge @entity111 said of mr @entity6 : ' he has lost not one parent , but two			1
' judge @entity111 said : ' it 's an act of wickedness almost beyond belief			2
he has lost not one parent , but two			0
' ' the theft of £ 43,000 is one thing			2
the theft of £ 43,000 by a parent from a young adult 's trust is quite another , when that sum represented most - practically all - the compensation he received for his father 's tragic death			1
' the offence you have committed against your son , the trust you betrayed - a second hammer blow following the death of his father - is so serious it can only be met by a custodial sentence			1
' the loss of a father in any circumstances , particularly in such violent circumstances , would have been a grievous blow to an 11 - year - old @entity6			1
nobody would have known that better than you			0

' in november 2013 the woman was sued by her son after revealing she had spent most of the money			2
she was ordered to repay him £ 43,750 but refused to do so after unsuccessfully appealing the verdict of the civil case			2
it was then police became involved , pursuing the mother - of - three on a count of theft			2
during the @entity23 trial , it was heard @entity6 , who has a three - year - old daughter with partner @entity171 , sent her 20 - year - old son a text message pleading with him to bring the case to a halt			1
' if you prosecute me , i will lose you			0
i ca n't face that , ' the message is said to have read			0
@entity88 ( pictured left on a family holiday in 2004 ) has admitted theft at @entity181 after squandering the cash left to her son @entity6 ( bottom left in the left picture ) following @entity7 's ( right ) death @entity6 was 11 years old when his father @entity7 was killed in the suicide bomb attack on a tube train near @entity191 station in 2005 ( pictured )			1
he was left £ 50,000 compensation and it was put in a trust until he was 18 she is also said to have told mr @entity6 she feared for her health and thought she had a tumour , an ' unfounded ' claim according to prosecutor @entity199			1
' to him it seemed like a guilt trip			0
the effect was , as far as he was concerned , emotional blackmail on him , ' mr @entity199 said			2
previously defending barrister @entity204 denied claims his client had ' frittered away ' her son 's money , describing her circumstances following her husband 's death as ' impossible '			1
' this is a case which is rooted in tragic circumstances which came about when a terrorist detonated a bomb on the @entity216 , ' he said			0
' his assault destroyed the lives of countless others in ways he and his co-conspirators could never have imagined			0
' ' she was living in a situation where she simply could n't work ... paying the ordinary annual amount to meet the cost of living , in the region of £ 30,000 or thereabouts , ' he said			2
previously mr @entity6 said his mother left him no choice but to take legal action			1
' i felt confusion when the police told me she could face prison			0
but at the same time i wanted some justice for what she had done to me			0
' she never showed me any remorse and she made me feel as if everything was my fault			0
although it is hard to think of your own mother going to prison because of a crime she has committed against you , i believe that i deserve some form of justice			2
' hopefully she will be forced to pay me the money now			0
but i should not have had to go to such extreme lengths			0
sadly , she left me no choice			2
' he did not attend her sentencing in @entity181 today			1
