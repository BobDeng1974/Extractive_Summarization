' low prices and absence of effective counter-marketing campaigns also contribute to high rates of uptake			1
' the study also found two fifths of men in developing countries still smoke or use tobacco and that these countries had low quit rates			1
there are wide differences in the rates of smoking between genders and nations , as well as major disparities in access to effective anti-smoking treatments			1

' using data from @entity118 ( @entity118 ) carried out between 2008 and 2010 , @entity55 's team compared patterns of tobacco use and cessation in people aged 15 or older from 14 low - and middle - income countries			1
they included data from @entity79 and the @entity105 for comparison			0
they found disproportionately high rates of smoking among men - at an average 41 per cent versus 5 per cent in women - and wide variation in smoking prevalence , ranging from about 22 per cent of men in @entity135 to more than 60 per cent in @entity136			1
rates of female smoking ranged from 0.5 percent in @entity139 to almost 25 percent in @entity140			0
women in @entity79 and the @entity105 also had high smoking rates , at 21 percent and 16 percent respectively			0
the study found that around 64 percent of tobacco users smoke manufactured cigarettes , although loose - leaf chewing tobacco and snuff were particularly common in @entity83 and bangladesh.with an estimated 301 million tobacco users , @entity149 has more than any other country , closely followed by @entity83 with almost 275 million			1

in low income countries , they said , for every $ 9,100 received in tobacco taxes , only $ 1 was spent on tobacco control			2
