by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:11 est , 22 june 2012 updated : 05:52 est , 23 june 2012 @entity3 's four leading business groups have voiced their support for @entity6 ’s plan to replace gcses with more rigorous exams			1
they said the tests have failed to prepare a generation of pupils for the world of work – the same argument the @entity16 has used to justify a schools revolution			2
the @entity18 , the @entity19 , the @entity20 and the @entity21 have now all welcomed mr @entity6 ’s call for a rethink of secondary education			1
his plans , revealed this week by the @entity27 , have caused a fierce row in the @entity29 as mr @entity6 had not discussed them with the @entity31			1
determined : education secretary @entity6 said he will publish a consultation document in mid-july setting out plans to scrap gcses and replace them with ' world class exams ' criticism : deputy prime minister @entity37 said the school system ' must be for the many not the few ' while @entity42 schools minister @entity41 said mr @entity6 's plans would create a two - tier system for pupils deputy prime minister @entity37 is furious that mr @entity6 wants to bring in a second qualification – which has been compared to the old @entity47 – alongside an academically rigorous @entity48 to give less able pupils a practical qualification that would be accepted by employers			1
on thursday mr @entity37 said this would create a two - tier system , and vowed to block the plan			1
yesterday he complained that he was kept in the dark , adding : ‘ neither myself nor the prime minister were aware of it			0
’ @entity59 ’s aides dispute this			2
mr @entity37 said he was committed to ‘ raising standards in our schools ’ but insisted any changes would have to ensure ‘ that all children can get ahead through hard work and aspiration ’			1
despite @entity31 complaints , mr @entity6 intends to publish a consultation document on the proposals in the second week of july			1
he has been backed by @entity71 , head of education policy at the @entity18 , who said : when will the @entity56 back the plan ? ‘ employers are concerned that standards in @entity3 exams have slipped , so action to make qualifications more demanding is welcome			2
we strongly support @entity81 reforms to increase standards in all areas of education			0
’ however , he said there were still questions about ‘ how this new system would provide a world - class education for pupils lower down the academic scale ’ , and stressed : ‘ the name change is far less important than the practicalities of how to deliver the best qualifications in the world for all young people			1
’ @entity100 , the @entity19 ’s head of education and skills policy , added : ‘ we are concerned that gcses in their current form may not be delivering			0
with the leaving age for compulsory education about to change to 18 , the time is right to review the role of a summative exam at 16			2
' @entity107 , director of policy at the @entity20 , said : ‘ businesses have steadily lost confidence in the ability of the education system to deliver young people who are ready for the world of work			2
if this is a route that leads more employers to say more young people are ready for the world of work , then it will have been successful			0
’ @entity121 , head of the @entity21 ’ education committee , added : ‘ we want the government to seize this opportunity to develop an education system that places the same importance on quality academic and vocational education			2
’ mr @entity6 ’s consultation is set to be published in the same week that @entity128 will discuss mr @entity37 ’s plans for reform of the @entity131			1
a @entity133 mp said : ‘ this is a test of @entity37 ’s seriousness			2
if he really backs high standards in schools he should shut up and back @entity6			1
if he does n’t , he can wave his @entity131 reforms goodbye			0
’ a source close to mr @entity6 defended plans for two new exams			1
‘ some children should not be doing the same maths course as someone going to do physics at @entity147 , ’ they said , ‘ they should be doing a more appropriate course plus quality vocational training			0
@entity3 pupils have slipped down international league tables in key subjects over the past decade			0
the most authoritative comparison is the @entity156 carried out by the @entity157			0
it is based on tests given to 15 - year - olds in up to 65 countries			0
when first carried out in 2000 , the @entity3 was ranked fourth in science , seventh in literacy and eighth in maths			0
the science ranking fell to 12th in 2003 , 14th in 2006 and 16th in 2009.in literacy the country sank to 11th in 2003 , 17th in 2006 and 25th in 2009			0
the most dramatic slump is in maths , where the ranking was 18th in 2003 , 24th in 2006 and 28th in 2009			0
critics point out that the sample in the survey has grown across the years , from 43 countries in 2000 to 65 in the last study in 2009			0
but , even when this is taken into account , the @entity3 has still slipped proportionately down the tables			0
under @entity6 ’s plans for a revival , pupils will be able to sit the new o - levels at 16 or 17 and the best pupils will be allowed to bypass the exams and go straight to a-levels			1
schools will be given the freedom to enter pupils for the exams when they are ready , rather than forcing everyone to sit them at 16			2
modular study will be abolished , with emphasis put on in - depth work and end of year exams rather than coursework that can be redone until it passes muster			0
pupils studying @entity201 literature will be banned from taking the text of plays into exams and maths pupils will be expected to learn complex subjects such as calculus in order to obtain an a grade			0
mr @entity6 believes the exams need to be tougher to prepare pupils for a-levels , which are also being made more rigorous			1
meanwhile , businesses will be asked to draw up a new @entity47 - style qualification for less able pupils – around one quarter of pupils struggle even to get @entity219 or e grades at @entity220			1
mr @entity6 thinks it is pointless to make those children sit the same o - level as those who are preparing to read a rigorous academic subject at @entity225 or @entity147 .			1

@entity37 comes out fighting and vows to block the proposals
@entity230 has *refused* to say whether mr @entity6 *shared* his ideas with mr @entity59 before they were leaked
education secretary *recommends* *simple* @entity47 exam for less able pupils
critics say the bold plans would create a two - tier system in schools
