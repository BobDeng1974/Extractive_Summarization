@entity33 star @entity4 pens a *strangely* *literary* tribute to a white fedora
@entity4 *watched* a man kick the hat from his accommodation in @entity18 and was entranced by the moment
' he kicked it . not *stomps* , wide , *sweeping* and *confident* kicks that sometimes set the hat *hovering* and *drifting* , others to roll and *bounce* '
the hat was left behind by its previous owner
@entity4 later collected the hat but *decided* he would not wear it as he is ' superstitious '
' come summer , on a sweltering day , perhaps it will become some hatless persons lucky hat ' ( *sic* )
