by @entity1 reporter published : 09:25 est , 1 november 2012 updated : 13:17 est , 1 november 2012 these underwater photographs might look like they were taken under the waves of exotic seas but they were actually snapped in a @entity6 canal situated under the @entity7			1
photographer @entity8 , 21 , captured these stunning images of @entity6 ’s most popular freshwater fish , which include bullheads , chubs and gudgeons			2
astonishingly , despite living next to @entity6 ’s busiest road and close to a sewage pipe , the fish enjoy a rich habitat in extraordinary crystal - clear water			2
picturesque : a group of @entity23 fish are pictured swimming in the green canal water overlooked by the @entity7 water under the bridge : a @entity28 canal running under the @entity7 is the unlikely home to some of @entity6 's favourite freshwater fish - such as minnows , right patience is a virtue : photographer @entity8 spent five hours standing in the freezing canal to capture pictures of a vast array of @entity6 fish - including this one of a chub @entity8 spent five hours standing in the freezing canal near his home in @entity42 , @entity28 , to capture the pictures which will be showcased in a @entity45 wildlife documentary			1
he said : ' fish are an under - rated subject			2
i used to go fishing with my grandad when i was a little boy and i still go with him now sometimes			2
' there are not many people that do underwater filming like i do			1
i get unusual photos that people really like			0
' some people are really surprised when i tell them they are taken in a canal under a motorway			1
it just goes to show that beauty can exist in such a mundane setting			0
' when it all comes together , it ’s a great achievement			0
the man himself : @entity66 photographer @entity8 stood for hours in the canal getting up close and personal with wildlife for a new @entity45 series point of interest : @entity8 hopes his underwater snaps of fish , including this gudgeon , will put @entity28 on the map for its natural habitats the murky depths : @entity8 studied photography at @entity79 and at @entity80 to learn how to capture the perfect underwater snaps - such as this one of a bullhead ready for your close up ? : every detail of this beautiful bullhead is seen in stunning clarity in this close up picture @entity89 : while this beautiful picture of a bream may look like it was taken in exotic waters , it was actually captured in a @entity6 canal ' i like recording their behaviour and then we can understand it - it ’s very important			1
' @entity8 studied photography at @entity79 before pursuing a photography degree at @entity80 , @entity103			0
he was even shortlisted for the @entity105 award while at college - for a photo of an angel shark taken on holiday in @entity110			0
he added : ' the nomination made me think i could actually do something			0
i was very proud of getting the tv deal as well			0
' none of my family are really interested in photography , it ’s just something that i have found on my own			0
' hidden treasure : pictured is the canal in @entity28 , overlooked by the @entity7 where young wildilfe photographer @entity8 took the incredible images not so natural : despite the motorway and people doing graffiti ( pictured ) in the area , nature has managed to prevail unlikely : @entity8 's underwater snaps of fish are set to put @entity28 on the map for its natural habitats what are you looking at ? @entity8 captured this close up of a swan			1
the majority of his pictures were shot in the same area childhood passion : @entity8 , 21 , says he has always had a fascination with fish after going fishing with his grandfather when he was little pucker up : a curious barbel appears to investigate @entity8 and his underwater camera spot the difference : a male minnow which are often found in large groups in fast flowing fresh water streams a great achievement : one of @entity8 's pictures is of a dace swimming near the bottom of the canal			1

underwater photographs were taken in a canal under the @entity7 near @entity28 and will be showcased in a @entity45 wildlife documentary
