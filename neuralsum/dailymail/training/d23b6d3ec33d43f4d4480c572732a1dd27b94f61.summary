by @entity0 @entity1 was the in the depths of war , and in the fields of @entity7 , his @entity5 comrades were fighting and all too often dying			0
but for @entity9 the @entity11 @entity10 it was an affair of the heart which threatened to end his war : the @entity16 officer was forced out of his regiment for marrying a ' chorus girl '			1
the love affair between the future lord @entity20 and @entity22 scandalised high society and seemed a timely distraction from the increasing sense of despair in 1915 for a nation which had thought the war would be ' over by @entity28 '			1
now fresh details of the ' scandal ' - although @entity31 would not have seen it that way - have emerged after the full background of miss @entity22 were studied for an exhibition on the affair			1
the marriage of aristocratic army officer @entity38 ( pictured ) and stage - girl @entity22 sent tremors through @entity1 high society 100 years ago the affair between @entity31 and miss @entity22 was certainly unlikely			1
lt @entity10 had been educated at @entity42 and @entity43 before the war was sent into battle in august 1914 aged just 21			0
he was given a three - day ' coming of age ' party at his family 's huge estate before his departure for the front , at which 500 people were entertained for three days			0
he was one of the @entity53 sent to stop the @entity55 invasion of @entity56 against overwhelming odds - the @entity5 in total was a tenth the size of the @entity55 one , and was involved in a bloody rearguard action in which eventually it stopped the advance at @entity66			0
in november 1914 , his family wrongly received the tragic news that he had been killed in action after his name was listed among those of the dead			0
in fact he was wounded			0
but their grief was caused by a mistake by the @entity77 , which had wrongly categorised their son 's injuries as a death			2
what exactly happened next is unclear			0
what is known is that @entity22 was working as a chorus girl at a theatre , taking part in productions such as @entity87 and the @entity88			1
she had to work long hours , six days a week for low wages , although there was a glamorous side to the profession - meeting wealthy audience members			0
it must have been there that they met - and in october 1915 they secretly married at @entity98 in @entity99 , west @entity100			0
shortly before the couple 's wedding , members of his regiment had been involved in the @entity106 , in which the @entity1 lost more than 16,000 men in an attack on @entity55 lines			2
two months later the union ceased to be a secret , and was front - page news in a series of newspapers			2
it became known as the affair of the peer and the showgirl			0
despite reports describing miss @entity22 as ' one of the most beautiful and charming chorus girls on the @entity100 stage ' , the union was not received well by @entity10 's family or his regiment			1
the union caused a scandal in the newspapers of the time , as this cutting from the @entity130 shows despite being embroiled in war , the perceived affront to the regiment 's association with the royal household was said to make his position untenable			1
as part of the @entity140 , @entity16 officers were felt to be obliged to follow the conventions of the royal household at the time			1
an aristocrat could not marry a commoner and remain part of the royal social circle ; by extension an officer could not serve his guards commission fully if he had married beneath himself			1
amid the growing scandal , the soldier quickly transferred to the 13th squadron of the @entity155 , which did not have such strict codes of conduct			2
but he appeared to enjoy his change of path in the military and described his new role in the war effort to his father after he was made captain in 1916			2
for many years @entity22 , pictured with one of her children , was kept away from official functions he wrote : ' the @entity168 has been dropping bombs round about us , in retaliation for our nightly ( and daily ) excursions behind his lines with the same purpose – but [ we ] have dropped considerably more than he ( and these much larger than his ) and have done him a great deal of damage , i ’m pleased to say			1
' in fact the change may well have saved his life			0
he served as a staff officer in the @entity155 , the predecessor of the @entity184 , rather than fighting in the trenches as the guards did			2
he survived the war - one of a small number who had served continuously from 1914 to 1918			0
it did not , however , end the chill which had affected his social status			0
because of his new wife 's status , the future third @entity193 was not allowed to take her to any official family functions - and for years her name was kept out of all records			1
the affair - which came twenty years before @entity200 abdicated so he could marry a commoner - was echoed in a @entity203 plot when @entity204 married @entity205 , a ' lowly ' driver			1
@entity206 had been known about @entity22 's life before she met and fell in love with the @entity209 , with experts speculating that they may have met while she was working at @entity211 in @entity100			1
but research for a new exhibition has unveiled fresh details of the relationship , including that @entity216 was actually her stage name , and her real name was @entity219			1
researchers studying her family tree have also found she was the daughter of a restaurant manager - making her marriage to a blue - blooded aristocrat all the more remarkable			2
the new details have been included in a show about the scandalous marriage at the @entity10 family 's stately home - @entity229 in @entity231 , @entity232 , run by the @entity233			1
dr @entity234 , who is leading the project , says as son and heir there was a lot of pressure on @entity11 , whose controversial marriage rocked a family already facing mounting debts			2
she said : ' there was a lot of expectation on @entity38 which makes his marriage to a chorus girl seem all the more dramatic and sensational and problematic for the family			1
' we have done some digging here and her real name was not @entity22 , it was @entity219			1
historians uncovered new information about about the scandalous marriage ahead of a show at the @entity10 family 's stately home , @entity229 in @entity232 ' we found out that her father was a restaurant manager , her sister married a miner and her brother worked on the stage			1
' we think is her route into acting and working on the stage she was from a very different social class to @entity267			0
' commenting on the union , dr @entity234 added : ' it must have been devastating news and such a scandal			2
his marriage had quite significant consequences			0
' the @entity16 is associated with the royal household and a rule had been brought in that actresses could not be presented at court			1
' so when he married @entity22 he was not able to present his wife at official functions			2
and he was an officer in the guards so he actually had to resign his commission and instead join the @entity155			0
' it is thought the couple met when miss @entity22 was working at @entity211 in @entity100 's @entity287 letters from @entity11 to his father reveal the older man 's original doubts at the marriage , causing his son to write letters attempting to persuade him of @entity296 's ' better qualities '			1
the son describes her as ' anything but the average chorus girl ' and says she is ' incredibly charming '			0
despite that , it appears that @entity22 was not wholly accepted as her name is not listed among the guests at family functions			2
but , despite the shock to his parents , it is believed that they were eventually won over by @entity22 , who became @entity309 when her husband inherited his father 's title after the war			1
a generation later , the archives reveal that the actress - turned - lady was immersed in the life of @entity229 and the community			0
the couple went on to have two children and archives reveal that the @entity323 - their grandmother - was happy to buy expensive coats for their children , suggesting that the ice had , at least to some degree , melted			0
lord @entity193 died in 1957 and was succeeded by his son , also @entity11 , the fourth lord @entity193 , while his wife died in 1976			0
their story will be told as part of @entity334 - local stories from a global conflict on @entity336 , @entity337 and @entity338 from 2 - 6 june			0
the story of the @entity231 heir and the showgirl - and the marriage which rocked their families - will be on air thursday 5 june 2014 at 8.15am .			0
