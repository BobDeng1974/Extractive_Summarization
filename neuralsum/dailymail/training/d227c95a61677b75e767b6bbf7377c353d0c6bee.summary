@entity2 backs are firmly against the wall at @entity4 today and , going by recent history , that suits them fine			2
@entity7 ’s side must resurrect the knack for summoning strength in adversity			1
defeat against @entity11 today would mean no escape from the blunt conclusion that they have spent this autumn locked in reverse , just when they were seeking to climb into the higher gears			1
this final instalment of the @entity20 series represents a shot at salvation of sorts and @entity24 will hurl themselves into it knowing that a full house of losses against the southern hemisphere giants would be an unacceptable return from a month of tests in @entity31			1
@entity33 scores at @entity34 in 2012 in @entity7 's first game at the helm for @entity24 @entity37 ( right ) and his @entity24 team - mates battled to a 14 - 14 draw with @entity40 at @entity41 @entity43 races away for a memorable try during the demolition of the @entity46 at @entity4 in 2012 yet , desperation has been their ally in the past			1
during @entity7 ’s tenure , his men have often delivered when cornered			1
they did so in their first match with an untried line - up and novice captain , against @entity56 at @entity34 at the start of 2012 , and that set a bloody - minded tone			1
the same streak of resilience under fire was evident in @entity41 months later , when @entity24 went into the final test of three against @entity40 2 - 0 down and weakened by injuries , only to fight tooth and nail for a commendable draw			1
later that year came the ultimate illustration of this stubborn character trait , as @entity71 and his side — battered by criticism after back - to - back defeats — stunned the @entity46 with a record 38 - 21 victory at @entity4			1
those were the encouraging early benchmarks of spirit under fire which need to be emulated this afternoon			0
@entity80 's team have a habit of delivering a big performance when their backs are to the wall for all their indignation about the negative reviews this november , it is imperative that @entity24 add substance to their defiance by winning			1
to do so , they will not be afraid to embrace traditional @entity2 virtues			0
the pack have often been dominant this month and the signs are that @entity80 will order his men to lean heavily on that likely advantage up front			0
two recalled players explained the thinking			0
@entity98 said : ‘ we have to test them out and see what is working and if the maul is working , stick to it — do n’t get bored of doing it			2
i do n’t care if people think it is boring			0
if it is working and it is killing them , let ’s exploit it and keep going			0
’ @entity110 , reinstated in the back row , reflected on decision - making shortcomings which have hampered @entity24 ’s ambitions this month			1
‘ we are not where we want to be , ’ he said			0
‘ our set - piece has been strong , but we ’ve lacked continuity and a real understanding of what we ’re trying to achieve in the middle third of the field			0
in that middle zone , you can get muddled up			0
‘ are we keeping the ball and playing multi-phase or are we expecting them to rush off the line continuously and make big hits so we ’ll keep chipping the ball in behind them and turning them ? ‘ i think we ’ve got ourselves a little bit mixed up in the last few weeks			2
hopefully this week in training we have put a plan in place to iron that out			0
’ @entity137 , @entity24 ’s exciting new no 10 , concedes that the backs must repay their team - mates in the pack for sterling service this month , which has been undermined by a lack of clarity and ‘ smart ’ play behind the scrum			1
but @entity110 was right to conclude that it has n’t been a simple case of good up front , poor behind			2
the home forwards have to carry and connect more astutely , while also sharpening their breakdown work , which @entity151 admits is still a ‘ work in progress ’			0
with that target in mind , there has been a continual tweaking of methods at the ruck , minds focused by the prospect of competing with @entity11 ’s supreme openside and captain @entity162			2
@entity24 have had a superb set - piece platform in their recent matches , but they are wary of the threat posed by the @entity11 in the scrum			1
@entity151 , @entity24 ’s forwards coach , suggested that the visitors are ‘ dishonest ’ in the way they seek to avoid a straight pushing contest , but @entity11 head coach @entity170 offered an alternative take on the matter yesterday			1
@entity173 flanker @entity110 has been recalled to the starting side and is backing @entity24 to bounce back @entity24 's powerful scrum has been one of the biggest positives from this autumn series ‘ i definitely think they ’re going to target us there , ’ he said			1
‘ they are probably more tactical than we are			0
they turn and wheel and move to the left			0
’ when told @entity24 suggested his side were the ones guilty of such antics , @entity170 added : ‘ all that talk they carry on about — we are trying to milk penalties and that kind of business — it ’s all irrelevant			1
‘ i do n’t think any referee is going to be influenced by @entity151 saying we are trying to turn the scrum			0
‘ what we ’ve got to do is be really united in how our binds are , get our body height right and push very , very hard			0
’ @entity98 insists that if @entity24 get an edge up front and in the set - piece , they will exploit it that is a straightforward philosophy , but these @entity11 do not present a straightforward threat			1
their commitment to attacking in wide channels through instinctive runners such as @entity205 and @entity206 makes them dangerous , even counter-attacking from deep			0
@entity209 described them yesterday as @entity24 ’s ‘ biggest test , defensively ’			2
@entity7 ’s team must not be afraid to revert to the old staples of territory and forward force if that is what it takes			2
their backs are to the wall and if they are true to themselves , that means they will be inspired			0
@entity11 coach @entity170 has denied that his forwards employ illegal tactics in the scrum			2

@entity24 targeting win over @entity11 after *disappointing* autumn series
@entity7 's side have historically *reacted* well in times of adversity
@entity24 delivered outstanding performances against @entity56 , @entity40 and @entity46 in 2012 when they were written off
@entity24 's pack have impressed in recent weeks
@entity98 and @entity110 have been recalled to the starting line - up
