it may look like a hi - tech instrument of torture , but this strange gadget is an exoskeleton for the hand			0
the device , called @entity7 , can be used to control robots as well as with virtual reality headsets to make video games more immersive			1
the exoskeleton uses haptic feedback to allow wearers to feel the size of a visual object they are touching on screen			1
engineers at the company claim they have created : ‘ an affordable mechanical exoskeleton system with force feedback for you to touch the digital world and captures your hand motion			2
' @entity19 comes in two versions – classic and more advanced @entity43 - which includes the haptic feedback			1
the exoskeleton ( pictured centre and right ) uses haptic feedback to allow wearers to feel the size of a visual object they are touching on screen ( shown left ) and could be used alongside an @entity26 headset engineers at the company claim they have created : ‘ an affordable mechanical exoskeleton system with force feedback for you to touch the digital world and captures your hand motion			1
here , a wearer of the @entity43 version ' feels ' a virtual cube shown on a computer screen the @entity7 exoskeleton is designed to be worn on the hand			2
it comes in two versions - the classic and @entity43 - both of which can be used to control robots or with a virtual reality headset , in order to play games			1
the @entity43 exoskeleton uses haptic feedback to allow wearers to feel the size of a visual object they are touching on screen			1
it does this thanks to two contraptions - joint gear - disk braking mechanisms - positioned on the index finger and thumb of the exoskeleton when contact with an object is detected , either by a programme or a pressure sensor , a signal is sent to the device , activating the actuators and the joints to lock the exoskeleton			0
this action prevents the finger from bending further inwards - creating a force on the user 's fingertip			0
the device can be used in a number of ways , including to control lighting , play a virtual piano and used as a tool to make music and paint in computer programmes			0
the classic version is simply an input device , so it can be used to control the mechanical hands of robots for example			0
it captures 11 degrees of hand motion including the rotation of the thumb and the bending of four fingers			0
the group of engineers and computer scientists came up with @entity19 after noticing a lack of affordable hand motion capturing devises in the field of robotics and virtual reality			1
after 17 versions , they managed to create an immersive exoskeleton with force feedback – the @entity43			2
the more advanced version provides wearers with digital force feedback for their index finger and thumb , which allows them to ‘ feel ’ a digital object			0
the engineers say the device can be used to control a robotic hand ‘ providing you with a better sense of presence by simulating a force feedback when an object is hit ’			0
‘ with @entity43 , we can take virtual reality to its next level , it adds a sense of touch to gaming and now you can now feel the size of a digital object , ' they explained , adding that the device does n’t allow a wearer to feel softness yet			1
the engineers have used the device to control lighting ( pictured ) , as a tool to be used in music production and art computer programmes and to play a virtual piano the classic version is simply an input device , so it can be used to control the mechanical hands of robots for example			2
the more advanced @entity43 model can be used in the same way			2
here , a complex set - up of robotic arms and the @entity177 devices show how they can be used to dispose of a mock - up bomb they have also used the device to control lighting , as a tool to be used in music production and art computer programmes and to play a virtual piano			0
the @entity7 classic is available to pre-order from @entity31 for $ 65 ( £ 40 ) plus shipping , with the @entity43 on sale for $ 179 ( £ 111 )			1
both versions of the device are expected to be shipped in may 2015 - providing the firm raises enough money – and there are metal industrial versions of the exoskeletons available too , for $ 5,000 ( £ 3,107 )			0
the @entity7 classic is available to pre-order from @entity31 for $ 65 ( £ 40 ) plus shipping , with the @entity43 on sale for $ 179 ( £ 111 )			1
both rare pictured in different colours			0
the @entity43 is the bulkier model , with extra devices in the index finger and thumb parts of the exoskeleton engineers say the device can be used to control a robotic hand ‘ providing you with a better sense of presence by simulating a force feedback when an object is hit ’			1
it can also be used to play a virtual piano ( shown )			0

dexmo device can be used to control robots and with virtual reality games
exoskeleton uses haptic feedback to allow wearers to feel the size of a visual object they are touching on screen , or in their virtual reality headset
affordable gadget comes in two versions - one with the haptic feedback
engineers at @entity28 company called @entity29 are raising funds to put their device into production , on crowd *funding* site , @entity31
the basic model can be ordered from $ 65 ( £ 40 ) on @entity31 and the more advanced @entity43 , which comes with haptic feedback , from $ 179 ( £ 111 )
