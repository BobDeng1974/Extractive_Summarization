@entity2 , 56 , from @entity3 , @entity4 , has carried out a total of 162 offences over the last four decades and committed his first burglary when he was just 13			1
however , despite his prolific history , he has regularly been given ' chances ' by courts after blaming his crimes on an array of excuses			1
over the years he has come up with a string of excuses including a drink and drugs habit , a claim he had been committing crime for so long it was ' difficult ' to give it up , warning judges that going to prison would mean losing his home - and even blaming one theft on a bout of ' insomnia			1
' last july , just four months after being given a further suspended jail term imposed for yet another raid , he was caught stealing three steaks from his local @entity16 store			1
but at @entity46 , jobless @entity45 was spared jail again after claiming he was stealing the £ 6 steaks to feed his new pet dog as his state benefits had been cut			1
instead of being jailed , his 12 - month suspended sentence was extended by six months and he was ordered to attend a drug rehabilitation programme			1
passing sentence judge @entity53 told @entity45 : ' nobody wants to send you to prison for something like that , but if you carry on doing it , that 's what 's going to happen			2
you 've got to take this as a warning			0
' previous court hearings were told how @entity64 had a ' lamentable ' criminal record with his first offence being a burglary in 1970			2
after racking up a string of motoring convictions after failing to pass his driving test , he was jailed in 2002 for 15 months for dangerous driving after embarking on a driving jaunt which culminated in him ploughing his car into a telegraph pole while fleeing police			0
in 2004 , he was back in court after he broke into the garage of a retired teacher and walked off with a box tools			0
the victim and a friend tried to carry out a citizen 's arrest but @entity45 tried to bite one of them on the arm in a bid to break free			0
@entity46 and @entity91 heard how @entity45 blamed his latest crime - in which he stole steaks worth £ 6 from @entity16 - on the fact he needed to feed his dog because his benefits had been cut he was later given an 18 month community rehabilitation order by magistrates and warned ' it was his last chance ' after he told how his best friend had died in his arms and he wanted to attend the funeral			1
he also claimed it had been ' difficult ' to give up his life of crime due to his ' unsettled ' home life			1
but , in june 2007 , he was back in court after police found him pulling a wheelie bin along the street which had a haul of lead inside			0
despite admitting theft and being in breach of a court order , he went free again with a conditional discharge after blaming his offending on ' insomnia '			0
in january last year , he was given another conditional discharge after stealing meat products worth £ 24 from the co-op , in @entity122 , and abstracting £ 60 worth of electricity			2
and last november he was arrested again after he was caught drunkenly trying to raid the home of another victim in @entity126 , @entity4 - only to fall down a flight of steps while trying to escape			1
over the years , 56 - year - old @entity2 has used an array of excuses to avoid prison including blaming his crimes on insomnia and a drink and drugs habit the 63 - year - old victim was awoken by the sound of what he thought was clanging steel from outside only to see the front living room window had been smashed and @entity2 staggering away from his front garden			1
the occupant tried to follow but lost sight of @entity45 who climbed over a fence into a neighbouring property and made off			0
@entity2 was later arrested and picked out on a video identity parade			2
in march last year , he went to court and insisted he had been attending counselling session for his drink and drug problems and walked free after a different judge told him : ' i find myself persuaded to give you another chance			2
' the latest offence took place at the @entity46 branch of @entity16 on july 16			0
@entity45 was due to be sentenced at @entity159 after admitting theft but his case was transferred @entity46 where a judge 's sentencing powers would have been greater			0
the court heard how @entity45 's motivation to beat his criminal behaviour had improved ' massively ' while on a drugs programme and it appeared he was getting on top of his heroin use			2
previously , he was on four or five bags of drugs a day , but he was now down to two a week and was ' smoking rather than injecting '			0
probation officer @entity176 said @entity45 had got the dog so he could get out more by taking it for walks and to help ' remove himself ' from other drug users			0
