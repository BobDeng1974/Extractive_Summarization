by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 can make life easier when it comes to setting an alarm or making a call on an @entity7 , but @entity9 ’s personal assistant also has its limitations when it comes to trickier requests			1
now , the original creators of @entity2 are working on a superior artificial intelligence system called @entity15			1
they say that it can handle more complex requests than the present generation of personal assistants - @entity2 , @entity20 and @entity22 ’s @entity21 , for example			2
the original creators of @entity9 's @entity25 ( pictured ) are working on a superior artificial intelligence system called @entity15 , which can handle more complex questions than the current generation of smartphone helpers @entity15 , which gets its name from the @entity31 for ‘ live , ’ can analyse the nouns in a sentence to provide more helpful answers than current @entity35 , according to its creators who are based in @entity37 , @entity38			1
the founders of the start - up , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 , told @entity44 that @entity45 teaches itself , unlike @entity2 for example , which only performs actions programmed by @entity9 ’s engineers			1
the computer scientists envisage that its capacity to learn and provide help to users is limitless			2
so it will be able to answer users ' complicated queries using its cloud - based ' brain ' when it launches			0
it can do this by analysing different nouns in a sentence to formulate an answer , creating code as it goes long without the need for any programmers			0
@entity45 could one day predict people ’s needs as it learns more about them and analyses nouns in sentences to provide answers to complex questions , which current smartphones ( pictured ) ca n't handle @entity45 analyses the nouns in a sentence when a person speaks into a smartphone			1
for example , if someone told @entity2 that they are on their way to their brother ’s house and need to pick up cheap wine to go with lasagne , they would probably get no response , or at best would see one useful place marked on a map			0
but @entity45 would isolate the words ‘ lasagne ’ , ‘ wine , ’ ‘ brother ’ and ‘ house ’ to formulate an answer , perhaps offering maps of the house and shops , as well as wine suggestions			0
it learns as it goes , generating code and could one day anticipate people ’s needs			0
@entity45 is an open system so businesses and apps will be able to become part of its ‘ brain ’			2
the founders said , that if someone told @entity2 that they are on their way to their brother ’s house and need to pick up cheap wine that goes well with lasagne , they would probably be met with no helpful response			0
at best , a current @entity25 would show a local wine store on a map			0
but @entity45 would isolate the words ‘ lasagne ’ , ‘ wine , ’ ‘ brother ’ and ‘ house ’ to formulate a helpful answer			0
this could be offering wine suggestions as well as where to buy the chosen product			0
@entity45 could one day predict people ’s needs as it learns more about them , so that someone slurring ‘ drunk ’ into their smartphone would be assisted by @entity45 automatically calling them a cab home			1
unlike @entity2 , @entity45 is an open system and will let businesses and apps become part of its ‘ brain ’ after it launches			2
its creators hope that @entity45 could one day be embedded in all sorts of everyday objects that are connected to the internet – as well as smartphones			1
while @entity45 sounds impressive , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity9 are all competing to build the most intelligent next - generation @entity25 and only time will tell how advanced their offerings will be .			1

@entity37 start - up has created a next - generation @entity25 called @entity45 , *meaning* live
@entity146 originally worked on @entity9 's @entity2 , which launched in 2011
system analyses nouns in a spoken sentence to provide helpful answers
creators say that the system has a limitless capacity to learn
@entity45 could one day predict people 's needs and be embedded into everyday objects that are connected to the internet , as well as in smartphones
