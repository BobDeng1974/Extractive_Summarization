@entity1 's jubilant players were bounding out of the @entity2 , reflecting on an outstanding night , but @entity3 was already looking forward			1
it did n’t matter that @entity1 had sent records tumbling , from reaching a fifth consecutive appearance at the @entity7 to securing a 10th successive win , @entity3 had already started contemplating another major issue			1
can @entity1 now start winning at a major tournament ? or , to be more specific , can they actually win a game against the best young players on the continent ? recent history , after all , has shown they have been anything but proficient in doing that			1
@entity18 took the lead through @entity20 ( second left ) in the first half in @entity22 against @entity23 @entity18 manager @entity3 celebrates after guiding his team to their 10th consecutive victory match report from @entity1 's 2 - 1 win against @entity23 ( 4 - 2 on aggregate ) though they have been fixtures at the last four tournaments , reaching the final against @entity33 in @entity34 in 2009 , their win ratio has been miserable			1
they have played 14 matches in that period but been successful in just four of them			2
what ’s more , the last two tournaments , under @entity40 ’s watch , were wretched affairs , a two draws and a defeat in @entity44 ( in 2011 ) were followed by three straights losses in @entity46 ( 2013 ) , in a group that contained the hosts , @entity49 and @entity50 they should ought to have negotiated			2
why did it go so wrong ? squad strength was an issue			0
@entity40 had good reason to complain in @entity46 that he was dealt a bad hand , given the @entity57 chairman of the time @entity59 admitted there was more importance on a friendly in @entity63 than the tournament in @entity46			0
that cost @entity40 , primarily , the presence of @entity68 ’s @entity67			0
but it was n’t just that			0
@entity40 wanted to ensure his players stayed in first class facilities but choosing a plush golf complex in the middle of nowhere was not , in hindsight , a wise move for young men who were susceptible to boredom and the atmosphere suffered as a result			0
@entity1 secured their place at the 2015 @entity82 with play - off win against @entity23 @entity1 and @entity3 may now look to start winning at a major tournament after sending records tumbling also , the fixtures they played before @entity46 were wrong			1
the @entity57 tried to get decent opposition but they end up facing cakewalks against @entity89 , @entity34 , @entity90 and @entity91			0
come that first match in @entity46 against @entity50 , @entity1 were undercooked			1
@entity3 , however , is savvy			1
he has fostered a remarkable close - knit spirit in his group and trusts them with responsibility			2
when away in @entity97 last month , he gave them down time , telling the players they were free to explore @entity101 on a day off			0
not one of his squad abused that trust			0
the set up at this moment in time is right and it should also be noted the impact that @entity3 ’s assistant @entity109 makes , putting on sessions that the squad respond to			1
the chemistry is right between the two men and they command the squad ’s respect			0
yet @entity3 is also wise enough to know the only things that general public will be interested in next june is results			1
if @entity1 were to go to the @entity120 and fall flat on their faces once more , nobody would be pay attention to the good work of the last 13 months			1
that is why @entity3 and his staff will leave no stone unturned going forward			1
already friendlies have been lined up for next month against @entity128 – a game which is set to be staged in @entity130 – and @entity131 and tough opposition will be sought out for the international break in march			0
@entity135 winger @entity134 ( right ) battles for the ball with @entity23 's @entity138 ( left ) so while he was immensely satisfied as he began the journey home on tuesday night , a man who represented @entity1 on 57 caps occasions as a player was not prepared to sit back and admire what he had just seen			1
for @entity3 , this has to be the start of a sustained spell of class			1
‘ i just want the players to keep knocking barriers down and perceptions down , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ i know what i want an @entity1 team to look like and the challenge for us next summer is to go over there and prove that			2
we have got @entity128 and @entity131 lined up to play in november			2
they are the types of tests that we need			0
it was a bit like @entity162			0
that set us up for @entity23			2
we had to go through those defeats ( lost to @entity63 , @entity128 ) and learn when the right time was to kill the game , when was the right time to play and buy fouls			2
our game management was really good			0
‘ what i really want is for us to go to the @entity120 and play in the manner that we have been			2
it is difficult to do that ( be exciting ) in a qualifying tournament as the games are different			0
if we want to be successful , we have to be a possession based team			0

@entity1 secured their place at the 2015 @entity82 with play - off win against @entity23
@entity20 and @entity182 scored in the second - leg victory in @entity22
@entity3 's @entity18 secured a 10th successive win
