@entity18 research into hookah pipes shows that the average session lasts around an hour - and in that time the smoker can inhale the same amount of smoke as from 100 cigarettes			1
he told him : ‘ @entity15 , thank you very much for not making the @entity41 public sweat			1
’ last week a study found how fumes from the water pipes of hookahs - used to smoke flavoured tobacco - contain the toxin benzene , which has been linked to an increased risk for leukaemia			1
researchers have warned of an impending health epidemic caused by a huge rise in the number of students smoking hookahs			0
the @entity55 says : ' some people mistakenly think that shisha smoking is not addictive because the water used in the pipe can absorb nicotine			0
in reality , because only some of the nicotine is absorbed by the water , shisha smokers are still exposed to enough nicotine to cause an addiction '			0
the fourth in line to the throne , who last week enjoyed a successful three - day mini tour of @entity70 - including raising almost £ 1 million at a charity polo match - spent last weekend enjoying himself			0

one user posted a picture saying : ' ca n't believe i just seen prince @entity0 twerking and i did n't record it			1
@entity101 , ca n't believe it			0

hookahs are water pipes used to smoke tobacco flavours such as apple , mint and cherry - and smoking is often done in groups , with the same mouthpiece passed between people			0
while their use began centuries ago in ancient @entity134 and @entity135 , hookahs are gaining popularity in cafés around the world - including in @entity41 , the @entity139 and the @entity140			0
