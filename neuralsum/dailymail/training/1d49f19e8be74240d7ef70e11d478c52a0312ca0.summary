making furious accusations of a campaign against his team , mastering mind games and ramping up pressure on referees – is @entity7 the new sir @entity8 ? last week the two former adversaries broke bread in a @entity12 hotel and if recent behaviour is anything to go to , @entity7 may well have been picking up tips from the man he calls ' the boss '			1
here @entity18 looks at why the @entity20 supremo is stepping into the @entity22 's shoes ... @entity7 ( right ) has similar characteristics to former @entity24 boss sir @entity8 @entity7 's antics at @entity20 are resembling that of @entity8 's @entity28 period of dominance at @entity24 dark arts the rules , @entity8 believed , were there to be stretched			1
his teams became infamous for surrounding referees at the drop of a hat			0
any minor detail to gain an advantage was forensically explored			0
early in his first stint at @entity20 , @entity7 asked @entity40 if he needed anything			1
the official jokingly replied that the referee 's room was not up to much			0
when he returned to @entity45 he found a flat - screen tv , freshly - tiled new showers and complimentary expensive toiletries			0
@entity24 became infamous for surrounding referees under @entity8 when decisions went against them media masters if @entity8 wanted to lob a hand grenade he would often tell the press to ask him questions about certain issues and then stand back and admire the carnage			1
when @entity7 wanted to get something off his chest this weekend he took it a step further – using the sofa on @entity64 's goals on sunday as his soapbox			1
on a different settee a couple of hundred miles north , @entity8 may well have nodded his approval			2
@entity7 asked specifically to be a guest on @entity70 ' show goals on sunday to air his recent grievances the @entity20 manager was not happy with several decisions during saturday 's 1 - 1 draw at home to @entity76 @entity77 ( centre ) was sent off after reacting to a challenge from @entity76 's @entity80 on saturday the studs - up tackle from @entity80 ( centre ) infuriated @entity20 star @entity77 and his manager @entity7 @entity84 and @entity85 restrain a furious @entity77 after he shown the red card for reacting to @entity80 @entity77 was given his marching orders by referee @entity88 and is set to miss the @entity90 final @entity91 ( anyone but @entity20 ) sir @entity8 was the master at creating a siege mentality			1
he often referred to the @entity95 ( anyone but @entity24 ) brigade and was resolute in his belief that everyone who was not a @entity24 fan wanted to see them fail			2
@entity7 is doing similar at @entity45			2
the happy one ? not so much			0
even @entity64 are against them , having the audacity to use the word ' crimes ' when examining @entity106 's various misdemeanours			0
@entity8 was brilliant at creating a siege mentality within his squad as they competed for numerous titles ruthless relationships and loyalty went out of the window with @entity8 when old father time caught up with his soldiers			2
when you 're time 's up , your time 's up			0
just ask the likes of @entity121 , unceremoniously jettisoned out of the club to make way for fresh legs			0
@entity7 is not afraid of doing the same and wasted no time in shipping out the old guard when he arrived for his second stint at @entity127			2
@entity129 defender @entity128 ( left ) was allowed to leave @entity20 on a free transfer by @entity7 last summer pressure on referees @entity8 was the undisputed master of manipulating the man in the middle ( and his assistants )			1
never shy of having a word in the fourth official 's ear , @entity8 time became legendary			1
if he felt harshly done to , he would make sure the referee would know about it the next time he took charge of a @entity24 match			2
@entity7 's attack on @entity88 was straight out of the @entity8 playbook			1
it will be interesting to see the official 's performance next time he is in charge of a @entity20 match			2
@entity8 ( left ) vents his frustration at fourth official @entity151 during their 2009 @entity152 semi-final vs @entity155 @entity156 @entity8 was known as the king of mind games			0
who can forget his winding up of @entity161 that led to the former @entity164 manager 's memorable meltdown on live television ? @entity7 can be less subtle but his attacks on ' specialist in failure ' @entity169 and attempts to unsettle title rival @entity171 ' are pure @entity8			1
@entity7 ( right ) has an explosive relationship with @entity174 adversary @entity169 agenda time and time again @entity8 complained of a media - driven agenda against his team of angelic @entity178			1
one of his last blasts was over a perceived witch hunt against @entity181 who endured a shaky start following his move from @entity184			0
in january , @entity7 was fined £ 25,000 by the @entity152 after concocting the idea that some kind of ' campaign ' was being led against his own team			0
sound familiar ? it should			0
@entity8 launched a staunch defence of goalkeeper @entity181 ( centre ) upon his shaky start at @entity24 winners put simply , both are winners			1
both are driven and will do what they can to ensure they are the ones celebrating come full - time			0
much has been made of @entity8 's decision to single out @entity202 , rather than @entity7 , as his successor			1
perhaps that desire to remain top of the pile followed him into retirement			0
@entity7 ( left ) and @entity8 have both lifted the @entity28 title 15 times between them			1

@entity20 drew 1 - 1 at @entity76 in the @entity28 on saturday *afternoon*
@entity77 was sent off after reacting to @entity80 ' challenge
@entity217 boss @entity7 's antics are *reminiscent* of sir @entity8
@entity8 would employ several *tactics* to give @entity24 any advantage during his period of dominance at the club
