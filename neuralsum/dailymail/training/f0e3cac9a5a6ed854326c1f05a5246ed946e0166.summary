in @entity1 , it is former @entity3 vice-chairman @entity2 who is remembered as the man who discovered @entity5			1
in @entity7 , though , they recall former club president @entity8 taking a 37 - year - old coach who had been relegated with @entity10 and installing him with a multi-million budget			2
@entity12 was @entity5 ’s assistant when @entity13 and @entity14 were at the club			1
‘ i remember the president asking me whether i knew @entity5 , ’ said @entity12 , who is still a coach at @entity7			1
@entity5 took @entity13 and @entity14 to the south of @entity18 and won the @entity20 title in their first year there were plenty of smiles when @entity14 and @entity13 were reunited with club stalwart @entity12 the @entity25 and his players : @entity14 and @entity13 return to @entity7 27 years after they won the title if @entity5 wins the @entity30 i do n't think @entity32 fans will ever forgive me ... i told @entity3 to sign him , says @entity14 ‘ i had a friend , @entity34 [ former @entity18 and @entity36 player ] , who knew him , and he said to me : “ he will become one of the best managers in the world			1
” and when he came , you could see he would be someone important			0
he was an intelligent young man who had a certain idea of football , tactically			0
‘ he came here with new methods , he made @entity7 more professional			2
in training methods , in making sure our trips to and from games were done in private planes , those kind of things			0
@entity5 was the start of the modern @entity7			2
’ but there is one feature of @entity5 ’s personality in those years which comes as a surprise			0
‘ he could get really angry in the dressing room , ’ said @entity14			1
@entity13 added : ‘ the veins used to pop out of his head ! he was an absolute firebomb in the dressing room if he was n’t getting what he wanted			1
’ @entity5 was capable of the odd explosion in the dressing room , the @entity1 duo say sir @entity69 was famed for his explosions and the @entity72 's dreaded hairdryer treatment @entity14 said : ‘ i remember talking to @entity73 about him when he was at @entity3			1
he told me he was very passive and never really got annoyed			0
and i thought : “ well he ’s changed then			0
because he did with us ! ” ’ @entity5 would leave @entity7 in 1994			2
‘ it was n’t the results , though , ’ said @entity12			0
‘ it was more to do with the relationship with the president			0

@entity5 managed the @entity1 pair in @entity7 , taking them to the @entity84 in 1987
they would go on to win the @entity20 title in their first *season* in @entity18
and despite his calm *demeanour* *nowadays* , the duo insist he could lose his *temper*
' he could get really angry in the dressing room , ' said @entity14
' the veins used to pop out of his head ! he was an absolute firebomb in the dressing room if he was n’t getting what he wanted , ' @entity13 added
