by @entity0 survivors of the @entity5 typhoon have been ‘ let down ’ by a slow aid response , the @entity2 ’s humanitarian chief said yesterday			1
@entity7 said that despite relief pouring in from around the world , it is still not reaching many of those in need a week after @entity13 struck			1
@entity14 yesterday sent the aircraft carrier @entity16 to help the victims , as anger grows in areas where life - saving aid has yet to arrive			1
@entity7 , the former @entity14 international development secretary , added : ‘ i do feel we have let people down			1
we need to get assistance to them now			0
ensuring a faster delivery is our immediate priority			0
’ she added : ‘ i very much hope that in the next 48 hours , that will change significantly			0
' it ’s true , there are still areas that we have not been able to get to where people are in desperate need			0
’ the death toll originally put at 10,000 around the city of @entity28 alone was yesterday dramatically reduced to 4,460 , although this is still expected to rise			1
with the stench from rotting bodies overwhelming and little shelter among the devastation , frustration has been boiling over as essential supplies fail to reach many of those in need in the city , where food and other goods have stacked up at the airport			1
just five miles away , thousands have found shelter among the squalor of a convention centre but say they have not seen any relief workers			2
hundreds of bodies in @entity28 are being buried in mass graves			1
policemen and volunteers carry a body bag for burial @entity28 's mayor @entity88 said he is desperate to move the bodies from the streets because they are ' creating an atmosphere of fear and depression ' the scale of the human tragedy is demonstrated by these @entity5 firemen unloading lorry loads of bodies in the pouring rain the city of @entity28 has a dire shortage of heavy equipment such as lorries which are needed to move bodies and deliver food the bodies were piled on top of one another in deep pits as fire crews and authorities desperately try to clear the streets of people killed by the typhoon amid deeply harrowing scenes , 300 bodies were buried in a mass grave yesterday on the outskirts of @entity28 while a larger one capable of holding 1,000 is under construction			1
‘ there are still bodies on the road , ’ said @entity88 , mayor of @entity28 , a city of 220,000 people reduced to rubble in worst - hit @entity46 province			1
there is a request from a community to come and collect bodies			0
they say it ’s five or ten			0
when we get there , it ’s 40			0
’ some areas appear to be teetering on anarchy amid the widespread looting of shops and warehouses for food and water			2
in some spots , @entity5 soldiers on trucks distributed rice and water as chainsaw - wielding teams cut debris from blocked roads			1
thousands more swarmed @entity28 ’s damaged airport , desperate to leave or to get treatment at a makeshift health centre			2
medical charity @entity157 described a bleak situation in @entity159 where 45,000 live			0
worker @entity160 said : ‘ people are living out in the open			0
the needs are immense and there are a lot of surrounding villages that are not yet covered by any aid organisations			0
’ survivors of the devastating typhoon are having to cope with barely any supplies and men as young as this one have to pitch in moving bodies these men have the grim task of placing hundreds of bodies in this enormous mass grave authorities in @entity28 said they urgently need logistical support because they can not move bodies and the deliver food in the same trucks about 2,000 bodies have been collected so far in @entity28 but authorities say there are many more , although the original feared death toll of 10,000 is now believed to be too high many bodies of people killed by @entity13 are still unrecovered with more corpses lying in the streets volunteer @entity189 added : ‘ what can we do ? there ’s nothing we can do ! we really want to know why the distribution of help is so slow			1
’ the @entity16 , with 900 crew aboard and seven helicopters , was sent to the region from the @entity199 yesterday as @entity14 announced it had increased the amount of help given to £ 20million			1
the operation will be one of the last for the carrier – @entity14 ’s oldest warship – which is due to be decommissioned next year			2
this combination of satellite photos show part of @entity28 before and after the typhoon a woman and her child are pulled out of the crowd to be prioritised on an evacuation flight in @entity28 soldiers hold back people desperately trying to board an evacuation flight but thousands are still waiting at the airport without food or water this lucky boy and his family were given a seat on a plane out of @entity28 and will most likely to evacuated to the capital @entity227 but the majority of survivors are not so lucky			1
this woman is surrounded by her children and pleads with a soldier to be given a seat on the plane @entity16 is being sent to the @entity5 to provide practical support @entity237 aircraft carrier @entity16 is being sent to the @entity5 to help victims of @entity13 , @entity239 has announced			2
speaking during a visit to @entity242 , the prime minister said that the ship will replace @entity244 , which has already been deployed to the @entity5			2
its helicopters may be used to assist with the distribution of food and water to survivors stranded in remote locations in the far eastern archipelago state , and its facilities to make water drinkable are likely to be in demand in a country where supplies have been badly disrupted by the typhoon			1
the @entity259 said that @entity16 , which has been taking part in war - game operations , should arrive in the @entity5 on november 24 or 25 , with 900 crew and seven helicopters on board			1
mr @entity239 said : ' what happened in the @entity5 is an absolute tragedy			2
you can see the devastation , the suffering , and it 's quite clear that we are going to need long - term help for those people			0
' as ever , the @entity14 people have been very generous with their donations			0
' the @entity14 government has already pledged over £ 20million , which makes us one of the most generous donors anywhere in the world			2
' but it 's practical action that 's needed as well			0
that 's why i sent @entity244 to go and help in the @entity5 and i can announce today that once @entity283 has started its work , we are actually going to be able to replace in time @entity16 daring with @entity16 , which is , of course , a carrier with helicopters - seven times as many helicopters as on @entity244 and with the key ability to process fresh water , so we will be giving further assistance in the best way we can			1
' the @entity259 was unable to confirm the current location of @entity16 but the @entity237 reported the warship was in @entity294 , @entity295 , on november 12			0
@entity16 , @entity14 's sole remaining aircraft carrier , will retire from active duty next year			0
