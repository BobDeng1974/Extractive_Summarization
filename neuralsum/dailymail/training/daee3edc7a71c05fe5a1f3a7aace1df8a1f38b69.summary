by @entity1 reporter published : 09:28 est , 20 december 2012 updated : 10:56 est , 24 december 2012 @entity3 parties are causing the winter vomiting bug to spread rapidly as sufferers are attending while still infectious , warns a norovirus expert			1

' it has been widely reported that the levels of this bug are 83 per cent higher nationally than last year			2
there is also a huge increase of the bug in the community and we believe that members of the public who are coming into the hospital , carrying the bug or similar bugs - sometimes without knowledge - may be contributing to the problem			0

the @entity113 advises the following measures : do not visit your gp surgery or local @entity117			0

wash hands thoroughly and regularly at all times , but particularly after using the toilet and before eating			0

the number of confirmed cases - where samples have been checked in the lab - have risen from 1,669 to 3,046 this season			0
