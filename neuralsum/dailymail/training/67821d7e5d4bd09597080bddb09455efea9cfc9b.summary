@entity0 looks increasingly like the man who gets things done			2
and while that may be good news for @entity6 , it is causing something of a stir in @entity9			1
the new @entity6 manager could not have wished for a better showcase to demonstrate his tactical credentials than this @entity13			1
this week he has been conducting open training sessions at the @entity9 headquarters in the wealthy @entity17 district of @entity18			1
@entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 are using the facilities of @entity23 , a club that is cross between @entity6 , in being the most popular in @entity25 , and @entity26 , in attracting the richest and most well - to - do fans			1
ironically this week they received a visit from @entity23 ’s most - famous player , @entity28 , the man remembered as one of the principal creative architects of the glorious , if flawed , @entity25 side of 1982			1
for whilst @entity30 may be surrounded by opulence and grandeur , he is developing a reputation as something of a grafter			1
and glorious failure is not a theme he is inclined to embrace			0
with a @entity70 side that many thought weak , old and deficient in quality , compared to the great teams of the past , @entity30 has set about devising a plan that has brought best out the players and , if they can beat @entity77 in @entity78 today , looks likely to take them to the semi-finals at least			1
there are problems associated with the unexpected success			0
@entity35 aside , @entity6 players will be missing out on his tactical insights			1
they return to training on friday , whilst @entity30 is likely to be detained at this tournament until the final weekend , meaning he would only join up with his new club on the eve of their departure for their @entity93 tour in late july			1
and @entity30 , a man not unused to confrontation , is causing a furore in @entity9			1
his great crime ? not playing 4 - 3 - 3 in the best tradition of the @entity70 football			1
it seems strange that the country that gave the world the flexibility of @entity104 is now so wedded to that idea they can conceive no other way to play the game and even the 5 - 1 victory over @entity110 , known in @entity9 as ‘ the miracle of @entity112 , ’ has not won @entity30 any disciples			1
for a nation that prides itself on domination of the ball , the fact that @entity9 have only controlled possession in one game so far — and that against @entity117 , where they only managed 52 per cent — and , even worse , are scoring from long balls and counter attacks , is enough to cause an identity crisis			1
the great high priest of @entity70 football , @entity127 , the leader of the @entity128 from the 1970s , has come out against @entity30 ’s playing style , despite the 10 goals scored			1
so now famous names are now rallying to @entity30 ’s cause			1
talking tactics : @entity30 with star forward @entity20 the circle : @entity30 addresses his players during the session @entity137 , the 1987 @entity138 , is the perhaps the most important , comparing the tactics to those that won @entity9 their last trophy , the 1988 @entity143			1
‘ i completely support the realistic approach of @entity0 , ’ wrote @entity137 in his newspaper column yesterday			1
‘ the 70s men , the icons of @entity70 football , long for the great football they played			1
but they use the fact they were such great teams and had such a great playing style as a cover for fact they never won anything			0
@entity9 were beaten in every final			1
‘ i remember going into @entity156 ‘ 88 and our first group game against @entity158 was one of the best matches i ’ve ever played in — but we lost			0
' after that we sat down with @entity161 and we changed it round to play a more realistic game			0
we changed the system and against @entity166 in the group stages , i was played as a left winger			0
‘ from then on we were on a high all our way to the final			0
in the final itself i even had to do a job on making sure their playmaker , @entity173 , did n’t get in the game			0
' i scored from a header in the box and though our playing style was n’t the prettiest , we were @entity179 champions and we got the respect for being champions			0
‘ football has evolved , which means that nowadays you have to be cleverer , more realistic and sly to survive in big international games			0
in @entity70 football we are often lacking this realistic approach			1
but @entity30 ’s @entity9 has been a massive example of this new awareness in the @entity13 in @entity25			1
' @entity9 have scored 10 goals so far in the first round			2
well , if that is achieved with so - called defensive football , i do n’t know how people expect us to shake off that label			2
’ cooling off : the team stop for a drink in the scorching conditions of @entity78 the significance of his comments is that the @entity202 , who led the @entity9 in that tournament , was also coach to the great @entity207 team of the early 1970s and the 1974 national team and was mentor to @entity127			2
if even the father of @entity104 could be functional and have the world ’s greatest player , as @entity137 was in those days , parked out on the left wing , then @entity30 must be allowed to evolve a style that works for his , less - talented players but @entity70 football is an earnest business and split along sectarian lines			1
you are either with @entity127 or with @entity30			2
the pair have no time for each other even though they both come out of the same tradition of passing football at @entity207 and even though both laid the foundations for the current playing style of @entity228 , @entity30 taking over shortly after @entity127 left the @entity230 club			2
like a religious split , it is baffling to outsiders yet those caught up within it are faced with choosing one man or the other as their mentor and philosophical guide			0
and @entity30 , who made his name with the superb @entity207 side of 1995 that dominated possession and passed the ball beautifully , has shown a greater capacity to adapt his ideals and hence has proved a better coach than @entity127			2
even at this @entity13 , he has proved flexible , switching the system at half time against @entity117 to turn the game around			0
despite the £ 65million spent on @entity250 and @entity251 , and the moves imminent for @entity253 and @entity254 , @entity6 may need some of that tactical acumen to coax the best from limited players			2
@entity258 : @entity35 performs a few flicks and tricks as he prepares for @entity77 lining one up : @entity30 getting stuck in with the ball at his feet indeed , @entity264 fans might have raised a quizzical eyebrow at @entity267 ’s @entity266 as the pivotal defender for @entity9 , or @entity270 ’s @entity269 as a key substitute , scoring a great goal against @entity273			1
@entity30 ’s greatest triumph though has been reviving @entity21			2
it had seemed as though the star of the 2010 team , which reached the @entity13 final before truly betraying their roots by trying to kick @entity110 off the pitch , had no chance of making even the squad			0
@entity30 had pronounced him unfit and surplus to requirements during qualifying , causing enormous friction between the two			2
yet @entity21 , once in contention to be the best player in the world , hired @entity295 , the former @entity26 coach , to get him fit and has transformed himself into the team ’s workhorse , statistics showing that he has run the most miles of anyone in the squad in the first two games			0
given the former animosity between manager and player , his willingness to conform has been remarkable			0
‘ i ’ve had my moment with the manager , ’ said @entity302			0
‘ but i have to say that in this @entity13 he ’s getting it right all the time and so far there has n’t been anything to find fault with			0
‘ the tactical work is something different to what we ’ve done before			0
his vision and tactics have given confidence to everyone in the squad			0
it ’s a joy to work with him and i have no reason to complain			0
’ as for @entity30 himself , he is unapologetic			2
his view is that , having lost his best midfielder to injury in @entity326 , he is making the best of what he has			0
‘ i lost @entity326 and i had to think of something different , ’ he said			0
‘ and i set up the system with specific players in my possession			2
i have come here to win not to entertain the world			0
’ he may end up doing both .			0
