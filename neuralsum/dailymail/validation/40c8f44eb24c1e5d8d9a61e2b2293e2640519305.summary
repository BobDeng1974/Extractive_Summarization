@entity0 has insisted that even @entity1 himself would have struggled to change @entity3 ’ fortunes if he were in charge at @entity5			1
after their dismal 1 - 1 draw at home to @entity10 on saturday , the @entity7 club languish in third position in the @entity13 table – 24 points behind runaway leaders @entity16 – and face an uphill task if they are to secure promotion via the end - of - season play - offs			1
however , @entity0 believes that with the club now on its third manager of a farcical season , the time has come for all those on the playing staff to give themselves a brutal reality check – before they end up costing yet another man his job			1
manager @entity31 puts @entity3 , third in the @entity13 , through their paces in training @entity0 said it would not matter if @entity35 manager @entity1 ( pictured ) was in charge at @entity5 ‘ we ’re now on our third manager and it gets to the stage where you have to ask questions of the players , ’ said @entity0 , ahead of @entity3 ’ league meeting with @entity38 on tuesday night at @entity5			1
‘ it does n’t matter if you were to go and bring in @entity1 – he would still have the same players to deal with			1
‘ sometimes it can help when a new manager arrives and is looking at it from a different angle - a fresh eye			2
but , ultimately , it ’s the same players going out on the pitch and if we ’re being brutally honest , it ’s us who need to get a grip			2
‘ we can sit and say we ’ve got international players in the dressing room but , at the end of the day , we have n’t performed and two managers have lost their job because of that , so we need to start winning games of football			2
‘ it ca n’t be all the manager ’s fault			0
that ’s why we need to look ourselves in the mirror and ask if we ’ve done enough			0
i can safely say that i do n’t feel as if i have			0
and i ’m willing to bet the majority - if not all the players - would say the same thing			1
@entity0 in action for @entity3 in their 1 - 1 draw with @entity10 on saturday ‘ we have a period now until the end of the season where everyone on the playing staff needs to get a grip			1
you can blame all different aspects - but it ’s only excuses			2
we have n’t performed on the pitch and that ’s the bottom line			0
’ after admitting recently that his second spell at @entity5 had been a failure on a personal level , with only three league goals to his name , @entity0 has certainly not tried to shy away from the grim reality surrounding the club			1
and he believes that due to their current malaise , the fear factor has now well and truly gone for any team visiting @entity5			2
he added : ‘ i ’ve been in the situation myself when you turn up at @entity5 or @entity100 and you ’re already beaten			0
they might have won 4 - 0 or 5 - 0 the week before and you look around you and think : “ oh no ”			0
‘ but that ’s not the case any more			0
@entity105 are coming with confidence and have seen that we ’ve been weak			0
previously , it was only @entity109 teams who did n’t change their game for @entity3 - but teams now are n’t worrying about us			0
‘ @entity10 came at the weekend and got the ball down and passed it crisply			1
they might have lost five games previously , but they probably looked at us as being weak and tried to get in our faces			0

*rangers* are third in the @entity13 table , 24 points *adrift* of @entity16
they drew 1 - 1 at home to @entity10 on saturday , and face an uphill task to gain promotion back to the top *flight* via the play - offs
@entity0 believes the players must give themselves a reality check
