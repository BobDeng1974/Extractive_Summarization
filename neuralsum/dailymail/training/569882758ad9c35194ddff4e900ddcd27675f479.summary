this was very nearly a victory for organisation and character in the face of stacked odds that would have left @entity6 on maximum points and seen @entity9 ’s stutter continue			1
instead , @entity10 was left livid at an incorrectly awarded throw - in that developed into @entity13 ’s scruffy late equaliser , denying a side who had spent 76 minutes playing with 10 men full reward for their endeavours			1
goal - line technology was required to rule that the @entity9 defender ’s stab from two yards should count , but @entity10 railed against an old - fashioned officiating error in the seconds beforehand			1
as part of his criticism he made a call for replays to be used more widely than just in the act of scoring			2
booked : @entity60 sent off : @entity53 @entity9 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity68 6 ; @entity69 7 , @entity13 7 , @entity70 6.5 , @entity71 6.5 ; @entity72 6.5 ( @entity73 ’ 6.5 ) , @entity74 6 ( @entity75 ’ 6.5 ) ; @entity76 7 , @entity77 7 , @entity78 5 ( @entity79 ’ 6 ) ; @entity80 5 subs not used : @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85			1
booked : @entity69 , @entity86 , @entity80 referee : @entity48 referee @entity48 failed to spot a hefty deflection off @entity71 as @entity6 cleared their lines seven minutes from time and as @entity10 protested , @entity86 acted quickly , curling over a cross that found @entity69 at the far post			1
he thumped a shot into the turf and on to a post and the ball ricocheted off @entity46 to the feet of @entity13 , who got just enough on it to claim @entity9 ’s first goal and point of the season			1
there was a delay as @entity48 ’s watch failed to buzz immediately but the correct call was made in the end			2
it was a cruel way for the rug to be pulled out beneath the feet of players who had stood admirably firm since @entity47 was sent off in the 14th minute for bringing down @entity74 as the last man			1
@entity10 switched his team from a 3 - 5 - 2 to a 4 - 4 - 1 and shortly before half - time @entity36 ’s predatory instincts earned @entity6 an unlikely goal that nearly saw them follow up their 1 - 0 win at @entity119 on the opening weekend with the same score at the @entity39			1
‘ given the circumstances you would accept a point being down to 10 men after 15 minutes , ’ said @entity10			0
‘ however , we feel an injustice			0
it was n’t just a slight deflection			0
the consequence was we were n’t set up the way we would have been			0
we all thought it was our throw - in			0
‘ let ’s give them ( officials ) a hand			0
there should be a big monitor next to us where the fourth official can say , “ hang on , you got that wrong ”			0
’ manager @entity138 acknowledged that his team , who failed to make the most of their advantage and fashioned scarce few chances , had got lucky			0
‘ we needed to show quality and guile and use our intelligence to know what was required , ’ he said			0
‘ we did n’t do that to a great extent in the second half			2
’ only four days ago , @entity6 suffered defeat in their @entity32 tie at @entity34 because of a defensive error from @entity46			2
another mistake at the back proved costly here			0
a dangerous ball from @entity54 rushed @entity157 into a pass back to @entity53 but when @entity74 got the first touch his foul was always going to result in a red card			1
friends reunited : @entity10 was unable to get one over his former @entity164 team - mate @entity138 keen runner : @entity55 covered a lot of ground for @entity6 during their match against @entity9 - click here to view the @entity171 statistics from the @entity39 saviour : @entity13 saved the day by scoring with seven minutes to go against @entity6 @entity48 got his first big decision right with the 14th - minute dismissal of @entity6 ’s @entity47			1
replays confirmed @entity53 had stopped a goalscoring opportunity with no defender covering			0
@entity9 equalised when technology confirmed the ball had crossed the line , although it was strange @entity48 took so long to give a goal			1
@entity6 were rightly aggrieved about the throw - in awarded to @entity9 in the build - up			1
@entity9 took charge of possession yet for all the neat interchanges around the fringes of the box , they failed to create much of significance			2
@entity75 was sent on in the 41st minute to affect things but his first involvement saw @entity6 open the scoring			2
@entity59 , excellent throughout , brushed aside the former @entity194 prodigy and struck a pinpoint left - footed shot from the edge of the area that would have gone in without @entity68 ’s intervention			0
but the @entity9 goalkeeper could only parry to @entity36 , who took advantage of some slack marking by @entity70 to slide the ball home			1
@entity6 were pretty comfortable after that , even when @entity206 arrived to provide variety			2
his shot after a breakaway bounced off @entity54 to @entity80 in the area but the striker sent his header harmlessly wide			0
it was left for @entity13 to show how it should be done and @entity10 revealed that @entity6 are close to bringing in a defender of their own			1
a deal is agreed ‘ in principle ’ with @entity217 for @entity218 , he said , but added that a potential £ 12million move for @entity221 ‘ seems further away than ever ’ .			0

@entity13 cancels out @entity36 's first half opener
@entity6 's @entity47 saw red for bringing down @entity9 's @entity74 inside the first quarter of an hour
@entity9 , who lost their opening match of the season against @entity231 , equalised through @entity13
