@entity0 has told his @entity2 colleagues he wants to stay at @entity3 for at least one more season			1
but @entity5 are poised to move in			1
indeed , the @entity3 hierarchy are ready to accept @entity0 's £ 75m buy - out clause back to a @entity9 club in order to refurbish their team and keep @entity13			1
@entity14 would love @entity13 back but , as long predicted by this column , have other priorities in team building this summer with targets such as @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			2
@entity0 wants to stay at @entity3 but @entity5 are poised to move for the @entity2 international @entity14 would love to re-sign @entity13 from @entity3 but have other transfer priorities @entity24 defender @entity19 and @entity25 star @entity20 are targets for @entity14 it could then be that @entity0 becomes a battle between @entity5 and @entity29 with the @entity30 in pole position given @entity33 rules			1
@entity34 , meanwhile , aspire to sign @entity35 international @entity36 but @entity3 are likely to win that battle			1
@entity34 are keen to sign @entity24 's @entity36 but @entity3 are likely to capture the winger @entity39 could become the new @entity41 manager next season			1
@entity43 goes into sunday 's pivotal @entity44 against @entity45 under pressure			2
if it goes the wrong way then @entity51 - on his way out of @entity49 - has been identified as a potential new man , @entity47 has been told			1
@entity49 manager @entity51 could replace @entity43 as @entity41 boss next season i am hearing while @entity49 have cooled on the idea of signing @entity57 , currently on loan from @entity59 , on a permanent basis , they are keen to buy @entity61 from @entity34 when his loan term expires in the summer			1
@entity34 , though , could play hard ball over the fee , wanting perhaps in excess of £ 10 million			1
meanwhile , @entity57 still harbours hopes of making it to a @entity69 club with @entity29 and @entity70 still possibilities			2
@entity49 have cooled on signing @entity57 but are keen to purchase @entity61 from @entity34 i am also hearing @entity70 still believe they will sign @entity73 from @entity74 on a @entity76 transfer this summer			1
but @entity73 , who has attracted interest at @entity78 , also has options with @entity82 clubs @entity80 and @entity24			1
@entity70 believe they will sign @entity74 's @entity73 but the striker is also wanted by @entity24 i was in the company of @entity85 snr ( father of @entity87 star @entity85 - now of @entity29 but very soon to be @entity88 ) last week at @entity90 's restaurant in @entity92 ’s @entity91 for a pre-launch of @entity94 : the documentary			1
some funding remains to be required to get the show on the road ; hence the event			0
but it would appear the project inspired by broadcaster @entity102 is on its way , not least because of the support of the @entity105			0
' @entity106 ' was mentored by @entity94 as a young @entity49 player			0
he still reveres the sadly deceased @entity110 @entity109 winning captain of 1966 , who was a football , fashion and style icon of his era			0
as some wonderful footage was rolled out @entity106 whispered in my ear : ' @entity119 was the guv'nor at most things , but he could n’t dance			0
' @entity122 ( second left ) revealed @entity94 ( right ) was the guv'nor but he could n't dance @entity124 there were many people , including ex-pro pundits , who somehow thought @entity128 received an easy ride from the media for his red card against @entity14 last week for a stamp on @entity133 compared to @entity5 striker @entity134 , who was also given a retrospective ban for a similar incident earlier this season			1
some went as far to suggest it was more evidence of a conspiracy against @entity5			1
the notion that there is unity of opinion in mainstream media is of course nonsense			0
@entity128 is shown red for a stamp on @entity133 during @entity70 's 2 - 1 defeat by @entity14 but it 's true that in general , @entity128 did receive far less of a ' coating ' for his nasty act than @entity134			1
the main reason was that @entity128 was quick to hold his hands up and quickly came out to publicly apologise for his act of madness			0
@entity134 , even after video evidence proved his guilt , remained in denial			0
@entity128 offered an apology and gained respect with his contrition			0
many people believe @entity128 received an easy ride compared to @entity5 attacker @entity134 @entity134 was handed a retrospective ban after stamping on @entity70 midfielder @entity170 at @entity171 btw as soon as @entity173 began celebrating his debut @entity110 goal after his hurricane entry into international football , the tv cameras flashed to the vip box and caught @entity180 chairman @entity179 beaming with a smug grin then turning to someone in the row behind			1
i 've no idea exactly what @entity179 said			0
but he was quite entitled to chortle : ' now that just goes to prove my point			0
' earlier in the week , @entity179 announced bold plans to raise the quota of home grown players in 25 - man @entity9 squads from eight to 12			2
@entity179 ( left ) shows his delight after young striker @entity173 finds the back of the net for @entity110 he also wants to see a reduction in work permits given to non @entity201 players of ' mediocre ' standard			0
the @entity9 have quickly come out in opposition			0
but @entity179 's idea is sound			2
he argues that there could be a lot more @entity206 out there but their chances of breaking through are being blocked by , in some cases , an obsession with overseas players at some clubs			0
@entity179 argues the @entity9 could have more kanes by raising the quota of homegrown players indeed , @entity173 - after a series of loan spells - looked to be on his way out of @entity220 because his route to the first team was blocked			2
@entity223 , who has long been coasting on the gravy train , was just one player in his way			0
@entity226 thought differently and blooded @entity173			0
it took some time for @entity228 , @entity226 's successor as @entity220 boss , to trust @entity173 to start in the @entity9 but at least he gave him a go			2
@entity226 , now in charge at @entity233 , argues there are many academy graduates up and down the country who , if given a decent run in the team , have the quality and hunger to be top class players			0
it took a season or so for @entity245 to find his feet at @entity5 back in the day			1
one wonders though , would @entity247 have the patience with a 19 - year - old @entity245 ? @entity245 took a season to find his feet at @entity5 and has made over 650 appearances for the @entity30 take @entity49 - they have taken 33 - year - old @entity254 @entity253 , who is effectively past it , for the rest of the season on a free transfer to plug a gap rather than recall promising 20 - year - old forward @entity260 from his spell at @entity262			1
given the @entity49 are safe from relegation surely there could be no better time to really find out about the striker - son of @entity268 legend @entity267 - who made one first - team appearance three years ago			2
but @entity51 does not have a good track record for bringing young players through			1
@entity49 signed 33 - year - old @entity253 ( left ) on a free transfer rather than blooding the club 's youngsters those @entity9 owners who object to @entity179 's plan should take a step back and consider it could make economic sense for them and not just boost the pool for the national team			1
after all , how much has @entity173 saved @entity220			0
the way he 's going it 's hurtling towards £ 50 million			1
@entity284 @entity285 have had the upper hand against @entity110 over the years , winning eleven , losing eight and drawing six			0
on the face of it , a weakened @entity110 team look vulnerable and one bookmaker make @entity285 6/5 favourites with @entity110 12/5			0
a 2 - 1 @entity285 win at 8/1 is decent shout			2
@entity173 , who is set to start , is 8/1 to score the first goal			0
one of @entity110 's best displays against @entity285 was the 0 - 0 draw they achieved in @entity299 in 1997 to qualify for the @entity109			1
@entity300 , @entity301 and @entity302 were among the @entity110 heroes that night			0
you can get 8/1 on a 0 - 0 draw			2
@entity301 was one of the heroes as @entity110 draw 0 - 0 with @entity285 in 1997 to qualify for the @entity109			2

@entity5 are poised to move for @entity3 *frontman* @entity0
@entity3 are ready to accept the @entity312 's £ *75million* buy - out clause
@entity34 are keen on signing @entity24 *wideman* @entity36
@entity51 could become the new @entity41 manager
