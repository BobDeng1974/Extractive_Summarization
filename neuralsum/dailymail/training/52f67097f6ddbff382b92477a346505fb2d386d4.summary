safaris are famed for offering the chance to get up - close with the world 's most amazing wildlife			0
but one couple had a closer brush with nature than intended , after they returned to their hotel room to find a giraffe drinking from their pool			1
@entity12 and her husband had booked a room for two at the @entity15 in @entity16 and made the discovery after returning from breakfast to find the unannounced guest making use of their facilities			1
it just did n't seem real or even possible			0
' the giraffe had managed to discover a private plunge pool raised off the ground and protected by foliage and decided it would serve as a good watering hole			2
@entity12 said : ' it was exhilarating			1
even though i crawled to the window and was below the window line , when i stuck the camera up on the windowsill , the giraffe was a little startled			1
but it held its ground			0
' i peeked over and flashed a giant smile in hopes of reassuring it			0
it kept sticking its tongue out as it studied me			1
' clearly it thought there was no danger as it bent back down and continued to drink			0
time to go : after drinking all it needed from the room 's plunge pool , the giraffe trundled off back into the wildnerness final goodbye : the giraffe did n't disappear without a last turn back in which it appears to stick out its tongue ' our ranger later told us that they have seen this giraffe before in the chalet area			1
' for some reason this giraffe is very bold , curious and thirsty			2
i do n't think they chlorinate the water in the winter since it 's way too cold to use			0
' so by all accounts the water is really clean and the giraffe only has to dip his neck half as far since the pool is embedded in the deck			2

@entity12 , 40 , was on *holiday* with her husband at the @entity15 in @entity16
the couple crawled to the window to snap the pictures of the giraffe
*animal* appeared *unbothered* by its *audience* before sticking its tongue out as it left
