if the @entity1 is really serious about getting @entity2 to embrace the @entity4 game , it may want to consider sending over the @entity5 whether @entity6 is playing at @entity7 or not			1
as @entity4 as apple pie , bourbon , @entity12 and @entity13 , the @entity9 cheerleaders have been an institution for decades and they are just as recognisable , if not more so , than their @entity1 team ’s distinctive star logo			2
after getting in early on tuesday morning , the ladies have been busy promoting sunday ’s game at @entity7 against the @entity20 , participating in community events , exploring @entity2 , and of course , finding time to practice			1
with only a short amount of time to get a lot of things done , the team has been attempting to operate with the speed and efficiency of a two - minute drill in the fourth quarter			2
the @entity9 cheerleaders wrap up warm and jump for joy outside @entity7 's world famous arch ‘ we keep saying “ you ’re only in @entity2 once , ” so that ’s our new phrase for @entity41 this week , ’ two - year @entity37 member @entity36 said			1
‘ we just keep telling ourselves we want to take in as much as we can			2
we ’ve foregone a few extra-precious hours of sleep to go see @entity43 and @entity44 and do some shopping			0
we ’ve definitely done our best to get out there and see the city			2
’ ‘ my favourite part about sightseeing was @entity52 and going into the @entity53 , ’ @entity48 , a sports massage therapist who hails from @entity49 , said			1
‘ we witnessed a debate going on about @entity55 and @entity56			2
that was an experience we would n’t have otherwise been able to have			0
’ the differences in language have also been somewhat of a change from the @entity4			2
‘ i think our favourite word is rubbish , ’ @entity60 , a four - year @entity37 member who enjoys @entity61 and ibooks , said			1
‘ we ca n’t stop talking about the rubbish			2
we have n’t been here long enough to start saying “ loo , ” but if we were here a few more days i could totally see some of us picking up on that			0
’ the cheerleaders visited @entity70 during their sightseeing tour of the capital the difference between chips , @entity76 fries , crisps and potato chips is still a bit confusing			2
‘ we went to a fish and chips place around the corner and then they had actual potato chips on the table for us , ’ @entity80 , who holds degrees in history , justice studies and sociology , said			1
‘ when we told the woman the chips were good , she told us they were crisps			0
okay … crisps , chips , @entity76 fries , fried potatoes , they ’re all good			0
’ although they ’ve enjoyed eating fish and chips , lamb , toffee pudding and other @entity55 dishes , the ladies are calling for ‘ some queso ’ in @entity2 as they ’ve been missing one particular taste from home : ‘ @entity103 food			1
i was born , bred and raised on @entity103 food and i ’ve been craving it , ’ miss @entity36 said			1
‘ it ’s only been a few days , but i ’m ready for some spicy , southern , @entity104			0
’ the comfort food of @entity6 may be across the pond , but the members of the cheerleading squad anticipate feeling right at home on @entity7 even though the @entity9 will technically be the away team on sunday			1
‘ the @entity9 are an international brand , ’ miss @entity48 said			1
‘ we saw people wearing @entity6 jerseys near @entity43 and i think even though we are the away team , our fans will be loud			1
we ’ll just own it like it ’s our home stadium			0
’ the @entity9 cheerleaders run through their routine at @entity120 @entity36 added : ‘ we could see @entity122 jerseys			1
we could see @entity124 jerseys			0
it will kind of be a melting pot. it ’s going to make the atmosphere very exciting because people will be rooting for big plays and whatever else is exciting during the game			2
the crowd is going to be lively and i ’m hoping to see the same intensity that they bring to a soccer match			0
if they bring that , it ’s going to be a loud , energetic and awesome experience			2
’ although the @entity9 wo n’t be returning to @entity7 next season , the ladies are hopeful they ’ll be back for a future @entity138 game or if the @entity1 installs a team in @entity2 permanently			1
‘ i think that would be amazing , ’ miss @entity80 said			1
‘ making the @entity1 a more international interest would make sense			0
this would be the best away game to go to			0
’ one thing many people do n’t realise when they see the boots , pom - poms and blue and white outfits is how much work cheering for the @entity9 requires , the @entity37 members said			1
although the ladies all have other jobs , their responsibilities for the team are full - time and there is no offseason			1
‘ practises and games are only 50 per cent of the job , ’ miss @entity36 said			1
‘ we have a lot of appearances , a lot of shows , a lot of radio spots and a lot of tv productions			0
every day of the week at least one of us is doing something			0
it ’s a full - time commitment			0
you ’re in uniform a lot more during the week than just at the games			0
’ ‘ who you are really matters , ’ miss @entity60 added			1
‘ we truly are @entity4 ’s sweethearts			0
we ’re representing the @entity9 wherever we go whether it ’s at our job , at our church or in @entity2			0
we do n’t have an offseason			0
maybe two weeks in january – unless we get booked			0
we ’re constantly performing , but we love it that way			0
’ the @entity179 face the @entity20 at @entity7 and can count on some familiar support across the pond much like in the @entity1 , tryouts for the team are held each year and it ’s not uncommon to see veterans get cut and replaced			1
the competition is stressful , but it also ensures that the squad is always showcasing the best possible talent on gamedays			0
that talent will be on full display at @entity7 on sunday and @entity190 , a @entity191 native who skipped fifth grade and aspires to write for @entity193 , has a message for anyone and everyone who ’ll be attending the international event : ‘ we ’re not just @entity4 ’s team			1
’ executives with dreams of establishing a permanent @entity1 club at @entity7 should hope @entity202 feel the same way			1
the presence of @entity4 ’s sweethearts in the @entity205 will certainly help the cause .			0

five team members - @entity209 , @entity48 , @entity80 , @entity36 and @entity190 - speak to @entity210
the ladies are enjoying seeing the city but are missing @entity103 food
@entity37 is squad expecting ‘ energetic ’ and ‘ loud ’ atmosphere at @entity7 on sunday
hoping to return for another @entity138 game in the future
