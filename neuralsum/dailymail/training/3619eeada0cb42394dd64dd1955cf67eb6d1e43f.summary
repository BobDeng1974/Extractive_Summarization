by @entity0 published : 16:52 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 04:25 est , 30 may 2013 going through my wardrobe recently , i found a pile of brightly coloured bikinis languishing in a drawer			1
they can go straight to the charity shop , i thought glumly , stuffing them into a bin bag			1
when i gave birth to my little boy 18 months ago , i gained something else as well - a wobbly belly , or , as it ’s affectionately known , a ‘ mum tum ’			1
so , i was pretty sure my bikini - wearing days were over			1
do n’t get me wrong , i do n’t hate my body			1
@entity16 walks with a buggy , breastfeeding and running after a toddler have actually helped me lose more than the three stone i put on during pregnancy			1
but , while the rest of me has slowly shrunk back into shape , my tummy has n’t followed suit			1
wearing anything body - hugging still fills me with fear			1
and , it would seem , i ’m not alone			1
in a recent survey of 3,000 women , 58 per cent said their stomach was the body part they most wished they could change			1
the problem is , like most people with children or busy lives , i ca n’t spend hours in the gym or afford to hire a personal trainer			2
but now , thanks to the latest celebrity fitness craze , i may have found an unlikely solution : hula hooping			1
‘ i ’m all about hula - hooping right now ! ’ tweeted @entity53 recently			1
‘ five mins in the morning , five mins at night ... in five days i lost two inches from my waistline ! ’ @entity56 , who can apparently hula while kneeling , @entity57 , who hooped throughout her @entity59 performance last year , and @entity60 have all credited the humble hoop for their fantastic figures			1
if they can do it , i reckon , so can i. so i arrange to meet hula hooping expert @entity66 , 30 , at a gym in @entity68			1
@entity66 first picked up a hoop in 2006 after seeing them used in a performance at a music festival			2
noticeable difference : @entity0 before the challenge , left , and , right , 5lb lighter with a flatter stomach she ’s been hooping professionally for five years now and teaches in schools , runs adult classes and performs at events worldwide , often using several hoops at once and even setting them on fire			1
the last time i picked up a hula hoop , i had ankle socks and pigtails , so i ’m understandably nervous as i join the 12 other women in the evening ’s class			1
@entity66 believes that everyone - even those who are hopelessly uncoordinated like me - can learn to hula hoop			1
the secret is lots of practice and the right equipment - the larger and heavier the hoop , the easier it is to control and the more it ’ll help you tone up			2
@entity66 recommends the @entity98 , £ 14.99 from @entity99 , to start with			2
as for what to wear , apparently the fewer or tighter the clothes the better			2
that way the hoop sticks to you rather than the fabric , so i opt for a purple vest top and blue leggings			2
as the class starts , @entity66 explains that hooping is like riding a bike - it ’s all about finding your own personal rhythm and once you ’ve got it , it never goes			2
music helps you relax , making the whole process much easier , so she turns on the stereo and off we go			2
toned up : @entity0 shifted her ' mummy tummy ' by regularly hula hooping getting the hula hoop ‘ in flight ’ ( to use the technical term ) is actually easier than i ’d thought - i just hold it around my waist and fling it sideways - but keeping it twirling for more than a few rotations is going to take some practice			1
@entity66 ’s tip is to stay positive - just concentrate on trying to keeping the hoop from falling			2
that ’s easy for her to say , casually spinning her hoop around her neck , but i get countless knocks as mine keeps clattering to the ground			2
@entity66 cheerfully explains that bruises are par for the course when learning , and that my stomach will toughen up , so i should look at them as war wounds			1
slowly , i start to get the hang of it , although i find it much easier to hoop in an anti-clockwise direction than a clockwise one ( apparently this is normal for right - handed people )			2
however , if i can learn to hoop in both directions i ’ll get better - looking abs , because i will then be working the muscles on both sides of my body			2
multi-tasking : once you get the hang of it , you should be able to hula while texting or reading some of the women in the class have been hooping for months and @entity66 shows them how to do tricks like twirling smaller hoops around their wrists at the same time , and moving the hoop from their waist to above their head like a lassoo in one smooth movement			1
it certainly looks impressive , but i ’d settle for just being able to keep mine going for more than 60 seconds			2
as for my mission to lose my mum tum , @entity66 recommends following @entity53 ’s example and hooping for ten minutes a day			1
for a more intensive workout , i can try turning round slowly on the spot while the hoop is spinning , walking while hooping and sticking my bottom out to make those muscles work harder			0
to burn even more calories i should vary the pace - exaggerating my movements to make the hoop go faster , then slowing things down which is actually harder )			0
armed with this advice , i go home , hoop in hand , to try it for myself			0
my first problem is where to practise			0
it ’s freezing outside , and after an unfortunate incident in the kitchen involving a fully - loaded mug tree , i quickly realise that with my hoop measuring over a metre wide , i will need at least two metres of space to exercise in			0
which leaves me with the living room			0
celeb fans : @entity60 , left , and @entity53 use hula hoops to keep in shape the next problem is it ’s exhausting ! my waist feels warm and i ’m out of breath within seconds			1
ten minutes suddenly feels a very long time			0
still , after a week of dogged determination , i ’ve worked out that looking straight ahead rather than down at the hoop helps , meaning i can do 40 rotations before it drops			0
three weeks in and i ’m improving in leaps and bounds - i can manage 100 rotations at a time ( about two minutes ) and have an impressive golf - ball sized bruise ( sorry , ‘ war wound ’ ) on my hip to show for it			0
i ’ve also lost a centimetre from around my tummy			1
the hoop splits into six pieces for travel , so i ’m even able to take it on a family weekend away			0
there are still a few issues - the hoop ’s weight makes it surprisingly noisy as it whooshes around you			1
i ’m finding sticking out my bottom so far almost impossible			0
and my arms really ache with the effort of trying to keep them out of the way			0
oh , and my husband finds it annoying if i hoop when he ’s trying to watch football			0
when @entity66 rings for a progress update after four weeks , i ’m thrilled to tell her just how much i ’ve improved			0
i ’m starting to walk around the room while hooping , can turn in a full circle and manage over 1,000 rotations in both directions			0
ok , i realise it ’s not even close to the world record of 74 hours non-stop , but it ’s a start			0
queen of the swingers : @entity57 hula hooped during her performance at the @entity247 concert i ’m eager to up my game - to be honest , hooping on the spot can get repetitive - so @entity66 suggests reading a book or chatting to a friend while i exercise			1
not only will this make the time go faster and occupy my arms , but it should help me learn to hoop almost without thinking			0
she also suggests going outside and jogging in the park with the hoop			0
i ’m less sure about that , mainly because i do n’t want to become a local laughing stock			0
yet surprisingly , it ’s not as embarrassing as i ’d thought - aside from nearly beheading a passing @entity259 , no one gives me a second glance			0
plus it ’s a lot easier trying new moves when you ’re not in danger of tripping over a coffee table by the end of week five , my tummy is definitely shrinking - i ’m amazed to find i measure 4cm less than when i started			0
my skills are improving , too			0
i can hula and jog on the spot , enjoy a bit of television and move around my living room without smashing things			1
who ’d have thought it ? after six weeks of hooping for ten minutes a day , i ’ve improved so much i can now make a phone call mid hooping without sounding like i ’m running for a bus			0
i can even paint my nails without a smudge			0
what ’s more , the difference it ’s made to my body is phenomenal			0
my ‘ mum tum ’ has shrunk by an amazing 5cm , i ’ve shaved 2cm off my waist and my bottom is 3cm smaller			0
plus , i ’ve lost 5lb and when i went shopping the other day , i managed to fit into a size 12 dress for the first time in 15 years ! my husband ca n’t believe the change in me and concedes that the inconvenience of having his football matches interrupted was well worth it			1
now i ’m looking forward to showing off my tummy on the beach this summer			0
looks like i wo n’t be taking those bikinis to the charity shop after all ... for tuition and class enquiries contact @entity66 at annathehulagan@gmail.com or visit @entity303			0
