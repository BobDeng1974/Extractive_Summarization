a @entity1 - led congressional committee created to look into the 2012 @entity4 , @entity3 terror attacks has formally asked @entity5 former secretary of state @entity6 to deliver her now - famous secret email server to a neutral third party for examination			1
the same committee has already subpoenaed the emails of ' close to a dozen ' people who worked in the @entity18 for @entity6 when she was secretary of state , the chairman of the @entity13 @entity12 investigating the 2012 @entity4 attacks said on thursday			1
@entity20 rep. @entity19 , the committee 's chairman , wrote to @entity6 's lawyer to say he expects her to give the email server to the @entity18 's inspector general or another unbiased examiner for an independent determination of which emails and other records should be in the public domain – or at least archived by the government			1
he gave @entity6 an april 3 deadline to make a decision , saying he would urge @entity35 speaker @entity34 to take action if she ignores his request			1
' though secretary @entity6 alone is responsible for causing this issue , she alone does not get to determine its outcome , ' @entity19 said in a statement			2
' that is why in the interest of transparency for the @entity13 people , i am formally requesting she turn the server over			0
' hand it over : @entity20 @entity1 rep. @entity19 asked @entity6 's lawyer on friday to hand over her email server to a neutral third party for analysis not a care in the world : mrs. @entity6 dodged talk of her presidential ambitions on thursday but a speech organizer gave her a ' @entity62 ' sweatshirt anyway ' an independent analysis of the private server @entity6 used for the official conduct of @entity13 government business is the best way to remove politics and personal consideration from the equation			1
having a neutral , third - party arbiter such as the @entity18 @entity75 do a forensic analysis and document review is an eminently fair and reasonable means to determine what should be made public			1
' @entity19 's committee has authority to subpoena documents and individual witnesses , but not pieces of computer hardware			2
that would require a criminal search warrant signed by a federal judge , and @entity6 is not thought to be under investigation for any crime			0
the hard - charging former prosecutor had told @entity91 earlier on friday that aides to @entity6 and perhaps ' aides to aides ' would find themselves subpoenaed			0
' we sent a subpoena to the @entity18 for emails from a number of individuals within the @entity18 , other than @entity6 , ' @entity19 , a @entity1 , said in a phone interview with the news service			1
separately , pressure mounted friday on the @entity103 , @entity6 and @entity104 with a new wrinkle in the flap over the nationality of many of its six - and seven - figure donors – many of whom , it has been revealed , have ties to foreign governments			1
former president @entity114 had promised the @entity116 administration that his family philanthropy would turn down money from foreign governments themselves while his wife was secretary of state			1
but a @entity123 investigation has established that it willingly accepted large contributions from more than a dozen foundations and companies and people who might be surrogates for overseas regimes			2
they included a member of the @entity132 royal family , a ' @entity133 oligarch ' who once served in the nation 's parliament , and many government - linked businessmen , according to the @entity123			0
overall , the twelve gave between $ 34 million and $ 68 million after @entity6 took over the @entity18			0
exact numbers ca n't be gleaned from available documents – only ranges			0
the @entity133 could be problematid for mrs. @entity6 because it involves millions from the @entity141 , run by a businessman who has been a strong advocate of his country establishing closer ties with the @entity145			0
@entity146 also served two terms in @entity133 's parliament			0
much of his foundation 's donated funds came to the @entity104 while the @entity18 was pushing for @entity151 , and against @entity152 , as a dominant force in @entity133			2
it 's unclear whether the foundation flap or ' email-gate ' will prove the greater irritant to mrs. @entity6 's growing presidential campaign momentum			1
but a @entity160 report this month that she had exclusively used a personal email account for government business while the chief @entity13 diplomat from 2009 to 2013 has reinvigorated the @entity4 committee 's investigation into the attacks that killed @entity13 ambassador @entity167 and three other @entity13			0
@entity6 is the front - runner for the 2016 @entity5 nomination even though she has yet to formally declare her candidacy			0
she has come under scrutiny from republicans who accuse her @entity18 of failing to protect diplomatic personnel			0
@entity19 said the @entity18 had asked him not to disclose the names of people whose emails were sought			2
@entity19 , a former criminal prosecutor , insists he 's not interested in @entity6 's private communications , but wants to elarn if she discussed the 2012 @entity4 terror attack outside the reach of government document - retention mandates @entity183 : @entity6 has been dogged by accusations that she hid work - related emails from the @entity18 by relying exclusively on a private email server hosted in her home but without their emails , he has argued , no congressional committee investigating the @entity4 attack could claim to have issued a definitive report			1
on thursday mrs. @entity6 said @entity196 politics has become too partisan , appearing at a national meeting of camp counselors			0
she told the @entity199 in her final paid speech before an expected presidential announcement that @entity13 's political class could use ' camps for adults ' to foster cooperation			0
pressure : @entity206 gave mrs. @entity6 ' devil horns ' on this week 's cover meeting organizers presented her with a gray sweatshirt emblazoned with ' @entity62 ' – the presidential retreat in @entity212 – but otherwise steered clear of her prospective campaign , pointing to a ' huge fun deficit ' in the nation and the need for politicians of all stripes to reach across the aisle			2
' we really need camps for adults , ' @entity6 said			0
' maybe mix it up a little bit ' so @entity13 ' have to come together and actually listen to each other			0
would n't that be a novel idea ? ' as she faces partisan criticism over the email mess , @entity6 has said that although she should have used a government email account , she violated no rules			0
@entity5 say that @entity4 has been thoroughly investigated by several congressional panels and that @entity19 's committee 's efforts are politically motivated and aimed at undermining @entity6 's expected presidential candidacy			1
@entity237 @entity236 told reporters the committee ' has spent millions of dollars ; produced nothing			0
i think we 're going to just see an ongoing attempt to investigate @entity6 , whatever the subject , whether it 's her emails or it 's her hair or whatever it happens to be			2
' @entity19 spoke to @entity91 on the same day senator @entity248 sent letters to secretary of state @entity250 and the @entity18 's inspector general asking for information on the emails of @entity254 , who was a top aide to @entity6			1
@entity248 said he was probing @entity6 's use of a program that let some of @entity6 's allies , including @entity254 , do private sector work while also working for the government			0
@entity19 said he was not coordinating his probe with @entity248 , and rejected any suggestion that the @entity18 might become overworked with requests for information about @entity6 and her aides			2
the revelations about @entity6 's emails have raised questions about the @entity18 's email practices			1
@entity271 : @entity6 is expected to annoucne her presidential campaign launch in a matter of weeks @entity236 , the @entity5 @entity35 minority leader , predicted @entity1 would keep pressure on , ' whether it 's her emails or it 's her hair or whatever it happens to be ' earlier on thursday , @entity13 officials said the @entity18 does not automatically archive the emails of its assistant secretaries of state , contradicting the department 's prior public statement			1
@entity19 said no decisions had been made in the @entity35 about when @entity6 would be called to testify , either about her email use or about the @entity4 events			1
he had said earlier that he hoped to call @entity6 to testify in april			0
on thursday @entity19 said the slowness of responses to his requests for information from @entity6 and the @entity18 had delayed that timetable			2
he said he wanted all relevant documents before she appears			0
the @entity293 also subpoenaed all communications of @entity6 's related to @entity3 this month , but neither @entity6 nor the @entity18 have produced documents in response to the subpoenas , @entity19 said			1
earlier the @entity18 gave the committee 300 of @entity6 's emails related to @entity4			1
@entity19 letter to @entity6 's lawyer about email server uploaded by @entity303			1

rep. @entity19 , chair of a special @entity306 , wants @entity6 's secret email server in the hands of a neutral , third - party examiner
april 3 deadline , or he will ask @entity35 speaker @entity34 to take action
he also demanded documents from former @entity6 *staffers*
committee is looking for clues about what the @entity18 knew – and when – about the deadly sept. 11 , 2012 terror attack in @entity3
@entity236 predicted @entity1 would keep pressure on , ' whether it 's her emails or it 's her hair or whatever it happens to be '
@entity6 also *slammed* as foundation bearing her name took millions from people with connections to foreign governments
@entity114 had *pledged* not to accept funds from overseas regimes while his wife was secretary of state
