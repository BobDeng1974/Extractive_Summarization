‘ some people might have found that exciting enough but … he [ later ] acquired and ran a company making pornographic films in which he also starred , ’ the judge said			0
‘ he describes himself now as a wealthy man living a playboy lifestyle			0
‘ his lifestyle involves essentially casual relationships with multiple sexual partners , a group or club of women known as his “ hunny bunnies ” to whom , in return for their sexual favours , he makes lavish gifts , including money , clothes and holidays , as well as providing flats and cars for their use			2
