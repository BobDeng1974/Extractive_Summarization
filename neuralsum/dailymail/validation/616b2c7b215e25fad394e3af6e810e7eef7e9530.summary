depraved mothers who gave up their lives in the @entity2 to live under the rule of @entity5 terrorists in @entity6 are taking photographs of their newborn children sleeping alongside handguns and assault rifles in a sickening game of one - upmanship on social media			1
featuring titles such as ' the @entity16 ' and ' @entity17 ' , the chilling images show innocent children being forced to embrace their parents ' extremism in @entity21			1
while some shots feature children so young that they are unlikely to be aware of the significance of the photographs , another shows a masked young girl of around three - years - old dressed in full combat gear , carrying an @entity29 and raising her index figure to make a well - known jihadi gesture			1
' the @entity16 ' : a newborn baby is seen sleeping under a @entity34 blanket			1
the otherwise adorable photograph is ruined by the fact an @entity29 machine gun is propped up against the side of the tiny baby 's bed exploited : a masked young girl of around three - years - old is seen dressed in full combat gear , carrying an @entity29 assault rifle , and raising her index figure to make a well - known jihadi gesture although the images were posted on @entity46 over the past year , they form part of a new study of the everyday lives and , inevitably , deaths of the young @entity52 women who chose to live under @entity53			1
one photograph in the study , which was published on @entity56 , shows a woman calling herself @entity58 posting a photograph of a young boy aged about five dressed in military fatigues and firing a huge assault rifle			2
she identifies the child as her son 's ' lil best mate ' and suggests he has already been killed , adding that she hope her own child ' grows up to be like him and receives and beautiful death just like him '			0
another photograph , this time posted by a woman calling herself @entity72 , shows a one - year - old girl sleeping alongside a small , black pistol and is captioned ' even my baby girl goes 2 bed with her gun # generationkhilafah '			1
a similar image was posted on @entity46 showing a newborn baby fast asleep in a plastic crate and covered in a @entity34 blanket			2
the otherwise adorable photograph is ruined , however , by the fact an @entity29 machine gun is propped up against the side of the tiny baby 's bed			1
the image was posted on @entity46 by a man claiming to be the child 's father and was captioned : ' the @entity16 # @entity93 was born in the land of the caliphate , i ask @entity96 to make him one of the @entity98 ’s soldiers			2
' horror : featuring titles such as ' the @entity16 ' and ' @entity17 ' , the chilling images show innocent children being forced to embrace their parents ' extremism in @entity53 ' de facto capital @entity21 a woman calling herself @entity58 posting a photograph of a young boydressed in military fatigues and firing a huge assault rifle			1
she identifies him as her son 's ' lil best mate ' , suggests he has already been killed , and adds that she hope her own child ' grows up to be like him and receives and beautiful death just like him ' the study reveals numerous other images of young children being exploited for shocking photographs that are later posted by their twisted parents on social media			1
the majority show young boys and girls dressed in combat clothing and brandishing weapons and are captioned with horrific messages by their parents wishing the children a hasty death			1
others show young boys and girls wearing clothing daubed in the chilling black and white @entity53 logo , stating that the children are being ' raised as lions ' who will one day fight against the @entity2			1
the overall effect is to instill fear in the @entity2 that even if the current generation of @entity53 jihadis are killed , there will still be generation after generation of bloodthirsty , brainwashed terrorists ready to fight and die in order to carry out atrocities against innocent people			2
the use of sickening images of gun toting children also allows the often very young militant parents to brag and boast about how ' hardcore ' they are , distancing themselves from @entity52 ideals of parenthood and encouraging them to take part in a pathetic one - upmanship on social media			1
