most of us will have felt the pain of a bee sting			1
luckily most of us will have avoided the dreaded pain of a tarantula hawk or a fire ant			1
@entity7 felt all three of these - and 147 other horrible , burning sensations - after a dedicated life - long career devoted to insects			1
on numerous fieldwork trips , the @entity13 entomologist would find himself digging up living colonies of creatures , who in turn were not happy with this destructive human scooping them into bags - and promptly sank their fangs , stingers or pincers into him			1
still , no pain , no gain , and @entity7 turned his experiences into the @entity28 , ranking 78 species in a list which , while subjective , was put together by the man who must surely know best , ranking their pain on a scale of 1 to 4			1
rating : 1.0 @entity36 says : light , ephemeral , almost fruity			1
a tiny spark has singed a single hair on your arm			2
rating : 1.2 @entity36 says : @entity42 , mildly alarming			2
like walking across a shag carpet and reaching for the light switch			2
rating : 1.8 @entity36 says : a rare , piercing , elevated sort of pain			2
someone has fired a staple into your cheek			2
rating : 2.0 @entity36 says : @entity51 , hearty , slightly crunchy			2
similar to getting your hand mashed in a revolving door			2
rating : 2.0 @entity36 says : hot and smoky , almost irreverent			2
imagine @entity56 extinguishing a cigar on your tongue			1
rating : 2.0 @entity36 says : the sensation is like a matchhead that flips off and burns on your skin			0
rating : 3.0 @entity36 says : bold and unrelenting			0
somebody is using a drill to excavate your ingrown toenail			0
rating : 3.0 @entity36 says : distinctly bitter aftertaste			0
like spilling a beaker of hydrochloric acid on a paper cut			0
rating : 4.0 @entity36 says : blinding , shockingly electric			0
a running hair drier has been dropped into your bubble bath			0
rating : 4 + @entity36 says : like fire - walking over flaming charcoal with a 3 - inch rusty nail grinding into your heel			0
he also gave un-scientific - sounding but apt descriptions for each pain , for instance the sting of the yellowjacket wasp felt ' hot and smoky , almost irreverent			1
imagine @entity56 extinguishing a cigar on your tongue			1
according to io9 , entomologist @entity91 described @entity7 's char as : ' a scale from 0 to 4 , in which 0 was defined as the sensation of being stung by an insect that can not penetrate human skin to 2 , a familiar intermediate pain ( honey bee ) , to 4 , an intensely painful sting			1
' the bullet ant , otherwise known as ' paraponera ' or the ' giant hunting ant ' , has a powerful sting that can last for 24 hours			1
some victims have likened the pain to ' being shot with a bullet '			0
luckily for most readers , the ant colonies can only be found in the rainforests of @entity111 , between @entity112 and @entity113			0
the locals there sometimes use the bites as part of their initiation rites			0
it gets worse - the locals weave the ants , which can grow to be an inch long , into clothes made out of leaves , and initiates have to wear the jackets for ten minutes			0
the locals will get stung hundreds of times - and reportedly have to repeat the act 20 times			0
if you think you can handle the all stings in the world , @entity7 made two other findings that might change your views			1
firstly , @entity7 said that the more painful a sting felt , the more aggressive the species tended to be			1
and , adding further insult injury , some creatures would also release a pheromone with their sting - telling other insects to join in the fun and give more stings to the victim			1
if that has still not put you off a sting , io9 reported how the stingers affected our bodies			1
' first , enzymes soften , then burst open cellular membranes			0
some of these cells , inevitably , will be nerve cells			0
wrecking these cells screws up all the electrochemical signaling that nerve cells do , so they end up firing off signals more or less at random			0
' other chemicals restrict blood flow , keeping the pain - causing stuff undiluted and in one place			0
' luckily , most of us will hopefully go through life with little more than the odd sting from a passing wasp or defensive bee - but spare a thought for @entity7 , who is bravely sacrificing his body in the name of science .			1

@entity7 's colourful descriptions *include* how the sting of a yellowjacket wasp is like ' @entity180 extinguishing a cigar on your tongue '
