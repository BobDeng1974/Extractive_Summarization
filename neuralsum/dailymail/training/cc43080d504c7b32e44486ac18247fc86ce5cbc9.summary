the chief prosecutor at the athlete 's murder trial referred to key parts of the conclusions today as the hearing resumed following a month 's break			2
during this time , a psychologist and three psychiatrists also assessed whether the double - amputee runner was capable of understanding the wrongfulness of his act when he shot @entity4 through a closed toilet door			1
' at the time of the alleged offences , the accused did not suffer from a mental disorder or mental defect that affected his ability to distinguish between the rightful or wrongful nature of his deeds , ' mr @entity35 read from a report submitted to the court			0
both mr @entity35 and defence lawyer @entity49 accepted the findings of the panel of psychiatrists and psychologists after 30 days of evaluation			0

@entity2 was born without fibulas , the slender bones that run from below the knee to the ankle			2
at @entity49 's invitation , judge @entity34 and her two legal assessors left the dais to closely inspect the stumps of @entity2 as he sat on a bench			1
the panel 's reports were submitted to judge @entity34 , and prosecutor @entity35 referred to key parts of the conclusions , noting that the experts believed @entity2 was ' capable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his act ' when he killed @entity4 , a 29 - year - old model prosecutor @entity35 has alleged that @entity2 , 27 , killed @entity4 after a @entity82 argument , and has portrayed the @entity84 athlete as a hothead with a love of guns and an inflated sense of entitlement the athlete was on his stumps when he killed @entity4 , and his defense team has argued that he was more likely to try to confront a perceived danger rather than flee because of his limited ability to move without prostheses			1
@entity56 noted that @entity2 ' disability made him ' vulnerable in a dangerous situation			0
' during cross examination , @entity96 questioned @entity56 's objectivity and raised the possibility that @entity2 could have run away from a perceived intruder on the night of the shooting			2

later in the hearing , the judge said she was ' very unhappy ' that the state were unable to produce a piece of evidence - an electrical cord - from @entity2 ' house			1

neighbors have said in court that they heard a woman screaming on the night @entity2 shot @entity4 , which could bolster the prosecution 's claim that the couple were arguing before @entity2 opened fire			1
the defense , however , has suggested the witnesses were actually hearing the high - pitched screams of a distraught @entity2 after he realized he had shot @entity4			1
the psychiatric evaluation came after a psychiatrist , dr. @entity133 , testified for the defense that @entity2 , who has said he feels vulnerable because of his disability and long - held worry about crime , had an anxiety disorder that could have contributed to the killing in the early hours of february 14 , 2013			2

but he requested an independent inquiry into @entity2 ' state of mind , based on concern the defense would argue @entity2 was not guilty because of mental illness			1
