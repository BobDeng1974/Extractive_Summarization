@entity0 paid an emotional homage to @entity2 for providing the inspiration for his maiden victory with @entity5			1
four - times world champion @entity0 was highly emotional as he stood on top of the podium after taking the chequered flag in the @entity10 @entity9 in only his second race with the @entity13 marque			1
not since @entity2 's last triumph with the @entity5 at the @entity18 in 2006 have the @entity15 and @entity16 national anthems been played back to back to hail such a combined @entity5 success			2
@entity0 ( centre ) jumps for joy after his impressive @entity10 @entity9 win with @entity5 on sunday @entity0 ( centre ) holds up his trophy as @entity24 ( second left ) and @entity25 ( second right ) applaud @entity0 revealed it was former @entity5 driver @entity2 who inspired his skillful win in @entity10 for @entity0 , it was the realisation of ' a dream ' sparked by his hero @entity2 who won five of his seven titles with @entity5 , but who suffered life - changing injuries following a skiing accident 15 months ago			1
' the team has been phenomenal , welcoming me the first day , ' recalled @entity0			2
' i remember when the gate opened in @entity13 it was like a dream coming true			0
' i remember the last time i was there was as a young kid watching @entity2 over the fence driving around in the @entity5 , and now i 'm driving that very red car			1
' of course , when i grew up @entity2 was my hero , and for all of us - and i speak for all of the kids at the go - kart track at the time in @entity15 - we looked up to him			1
' when he turned up every year , and to look after us a little bit , it made our lives			0
' so that 's why i think ... i probably do n't understand yet how special it is			0
' @entity0 's win was no fluke , beating @entity58 duo @entity24 and @entity25 in a straight fight as he made good use of better tyre wear in the 30 degree heat at the @entity63			2
@entity2 ( right ) celebrates winning the @entity10 @entity9 with team - mate @entity64 in 2000 following @entity58 ' domination last season , when only technical woes denied them victories in all but three of the 19 races , and after an easy win in the season - opening event in @entity73 , this defeat came as a surprise to reigning champion @entity24			1
' huge congratulations to @entity76 and @entity5 , ' said @entity24 , who finished 8.5secs adrift of @entity0 at the end of the 56 laps			1
' you have to hand it to them - i was n't expecting them to be as quick as they were			0
they had some serious pace and deserved the win			0
' @entity25 , meanwhile , was left chewing on his words as a fortnight ago after the race in @entity73 he had called on @entity5 to give them a fight			0
it was a case of ' be careful what you wish for ' , with an unhappy @entity25 stating : ' @entity5 did an awesome job and deserved to win			2
@entity96 crosses the finishing line and gives the fistpump as @entity5 team members celebrate at trackside @entity5 's @entity0 in front ahead of @entity15 compatriot @entity25 , of @entity58 , during the @entity10 @entity9 four - time world champion @entity0 on his way to a comfortable victory at the @entity10 @entity9 on sunday @entity105 stats provided by @entity106 ' we 'll be back next race			1
all i can say now , on behalf of our team is : game on , @entity5 ! ' @entity112 could arguably have joined team - mate @entity0 in the top three but for a lap - one puncture as the @entity114 finished fourth			1
behind @entity118 duo @entity117 and @entity119 in fifth and sixth , @entity116 created @entity105 history by becoming the youngest to score points at the age of 17 years 180 days by claiming seventh in his @entity124			0
@entity5 's @entity126 driver @entity112 makes his way back to the pits with a blown out tyre as for @entity130 , what must he be thinking after quitting @entity5 last year to join struggling @entity132 as in his first race for the team he retired after 21 laps with an @entity138 cooling problem			0
team - mate @entity139 retired 21 laps later with a turbo issue , leaving neither of the team 's cars classified for the first time since the 2006 @entity145			0
