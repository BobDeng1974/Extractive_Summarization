by @entity0 published : 17:08 est , 28 august 2013 updated : 17:52 est , 28 august 2013 who would you call the love of your life ? the person who still inspires that delicious puff of wind around the heart - regardless of whether the relationship lasted or not ? many of us think of our first grand passion , rather than the dependable type we married - or so says a recent survey that showed one in seven admit they did n't end up with their ' true love ' and instead opted for ' second best '			1
it sounds harsh but we 've all been there : harking back to an old flame when times got tough or - even more corrosive - uneventful			2
first love : @entity23 with @entity24 in 1961 i am no different			1
i dumped the so - called ' love of my life ' some 50 years ago and was lucky enough to go on to be happily married to my late husband , @entity28 , for half of that time			1
despite my good fortune , more than once during my marriage i confess i did recall that certain figure with a wistful sigh			2
so when i got the chance to meet up with him after 40 years apart , did we still have chemistry ? despite later happiness , was my first love ' the one ' ? like many ' true loves ' , @entity24 and i had the odds firmly stacked against us : he coming from an upper - class wealthy @entity43 family and me from an @entity45 background			1
he 'd been ' affianced ' at 16 to another wealthy @entity47 socialite : i 'd been forbidden - at the risk of being disowned by my very religious father who was desperate for me to marry within the faith - from ever seeing him			1
we had spotted each other at the @entity53 , where we 'd both been studying in the early @entity54			1
tall , athletic and as devastatingly handsome as any @entity57 statue , he was also clever , animated , and sophisticated beyond his years - thanks to a privileged education and years spent travelling the world			1
and the @entity43 thing was so intoxicating : the warmth , the music , the lively discussions , the big sunday lunches with the lemon - scented lamb , the generosity			2
second time lucky : @entity23 with her late husband @entity28 it was so captivatingly at odds with the other students and their limited spag - bol - bedsit lifestyles			1
@entity24 thought nothing of wining and dining me at chic @entity75 's in @entity76 's , or dancing the night away at the @entity78 club			2
everything he did was excessive : extravagant , pleasurable in the extreme and all new to me			2
someone once said the @entity43 ' have honey running through their veins ' and that , combined with his machismo and tenderness , made @entity24 hard for a 19 - year - old ingénue to resist			2
when we were n't making love and vowing devotion , we read romantic poetry			1
and when he was n't teaching me how to eat artichokes or notice the difference between @entity93 and ordinary cream , we were taking trips into the country in the sports car he 'd assembled @entity99 there was one wonderful holiday sailing round the @entity43 islands - my parents knew i was there but had no idea who with			1
' as we get older we want to smooth the edges and a trip down memory lane allows us to re-imagine the past ' oh , memories of the fresh fish in the waterside tavernas , of jumping off the rocks into limpid azure waters , and the scent of honey and thyme on @entity117			2
but oh , too , the rows throughout the affair : the slammed doors , the hysterics at home , threats from my parents , the terrible scenes , the promises he never kept , the pain i felt every time i heard he was with yet another blue - eyed , dark - haired dead - ringer for myself			2
they were always waiting in the wings during our frequent splits , which the @entity135 crowd followed as if we were @entity136 and @entity137			2
it all ended badly , of course			2
after two and a half years on and off , i finally ended it			1
despite his charm , @entity24 had one fatal flaw : he did not believe in fidelity			2
or rather , he could not tolerate any vacuum : it would instantly be filled by one of the many women who seemed to swirl around him			2
not only could he not resist a pretty face , but the face often belonged to one of my so - called friends			0
i 've no idea how many times he cheated on me - and he did n’t seem to regard it as at all important as i was ' the one '			0
normally , if i found out , he ’d simply say : ' come on darling … you know you ’re the one i love			1
' something in the mellifluous tones , the subtle musk of his aftershave and his sheer beauty would convince me to forgive			0
i would be back in his arms , about to end the war with a passionate peace			1
that 's how all our arguments ended : in bed			0
but all the love - making in the world was n’t going to resolve them for good			1
the final straw came when i found out that he ’d bought a house in @entity173 for the fiancee he told me he 'd ditched long before			1
wistful : @entity23 often thought of her old flame but learnt they were right to separate soon after he graduated , he went on to marry said girl			0
he made a spectacular political career for himself at one point before several reversals of fortune			0
as for me , i went to @entity185 at 22 where i met @entity28 , a @entity186 - born artist 16 years older than myself who proposed on the second date			1
we were married nearly 25 years before he died in 1987			1
during this time , i ’d occasionally heard news of @entity24			0
but he 'd been out of touch for a very long time when , five years or so ago , i received an ' urgent ' and suspiciously affectionate email via the @entity135 begging me to meet him			1
he seemed to be fantasising about those halcyon days			0
i agreed to see him when he revealed he was being treated for a ‘ little light leukaemia ’			0
had this prompted his desire to meet up ? ' i felt both let down and relieved that i would n't feel obliged to see him again			1
i 'd made the right call all those years ago ' i felt puzzled and curious rather than excited			1
but there was , in spite of myself , a slight quickening of my heartbeat as i waited at my local station forecourt for @entity24 to emerge			0
when he did , i had to look twice			0
the man advancing towards me was tall , white - haired and bearded			0
the chiselled features were still there but the face was fuller , slightly jowly , his eyes unfathomable			0
it was him - but not him			0
too many years had elapsed and i felt nothing as we embraced and exchanged greetings			1
he might just as well have been a statue			0
my instincts were proved right when i discovered he ’d divorced a few years after moving into that swish @entity173 house			1
worse , he went on to have three further wives ! each marriage ended in heartbreak - for the women			0
i 'd had a lucky escape			1
we made conversation but i felt no connection			0
even the luxuriant atmosphere of my favourite restaurant - the @entity226 in @entity227 - failed to do the trick			0
i felt flat , irritated , even bored			0
conversation revolved around him : his high - flying career , his divorces and his finances			0
he seemed to have little interest in my own life , apart from telling me i ' did too much ' and ' looked tired '			1
grass is greener ? in a recent survey one in seven said they did n't end up with their ' true love ' and settled for ' second best ' ( posed by models ) i felt both let down and relieved that i would n’t feel obliged to see him again			1
i ’d made the right call all those years ago			1
far from being ' second best ' , my husband was very much the right choice			0
@entity28 brought out the best in me - allowed me to develop my potential while i , hopefully , helped nurture his creativity			0
together we 'd created a family - a son and a daughter - the most precious thing of all			1
@entity24 and i went our separate ways once more			0
although our past chemistry was absent , i still persist in seeing him in a golden miasma			0
once a romantic , always a romantic			0
yet i 'm sure others who ponder over a past love would reach similar conclusions were they to reunite			1
as we get older we want to smooth the edges and a trip down memory lane allows us to re-imagine the past			0
but we would do better to shed these memories once and for all and accept that second best may truly be the best			0
after all , you 've none of the neediness , despair and self - deception that inevitably accompany doomed love			2
so if you hark back to the ' one who got away ' , take note			0
the end of that relationship was probably the making of you			2
far from regret , we should congratulate ourselves for choosing enduring love over short - lived , jagged passion			2
ordinary cream rather than @entity93 , so to speak .			0

in a recent survey one in seven said they did n't end up with their ' true love '
@entity0 was dumped by the ' love of my life '
but years later she met him again and realised she 'd had a lucky escape
