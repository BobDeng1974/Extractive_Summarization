for four decades , @entity0 lived with a giant tumour growing from his neck			2
at its heaviest the mass weighed a stone and measured twice the size of his head			1
but after walking for three days , @entity0 is finally free of the growth , after charitable medics performed a 12 - hour operation to rid him of the tumour			1
the procedure , one of the most life - changing performed by the team at @entity16 , saw doctors and nurses remove one of the biggest tumours the charity has seen in its 30 - year history			1
the operation took twice as long as expected and once removed , the team discovered the growth weighed a staggering 16.45lbs ( 7.46kg ) tumour - just over a stone			1
the mass grew to weigh just over a stone and was twice the size of his head , when medics finally removed it four decades later after hearing the international charity @entity16 had docked a vessel at the port of @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity0 and his grandson walked for three days to reach the crew seeking help			1
he is pictured after the life - changing operation with @entity46 anaesthetist dr @entity45 speaking ahead of his life - changing operation , @entity0 , who is around 60 years old , but does n't know his exact date of birth , said : ' my heart is very , very happy			1
' i 'm very happy			0
' i know without surgery i will die			0
i know i might die in surgery , but i already feel dead inside from the way i 'm treated			0
' i choose to have surgery			0
' when he was in his 20s , @entity0 , who is from a rural part of @entity39 , developed a swelling in his left cheek			1
gradually , as the tumour grew his head began to lean progressively the other way to cope with the weight of the mass. the size of the tumour began to place growing pressure on his body , with his heart struggling to cope with the weight of the burden			2
when he arrived in the eastern port of @entity38 , @entity0 had just one stop to make			0
he sought out the @entity76 docked there , and appealed to the crew for help			0
they faced a number of difficulties preparing for the operation , having never dealt with a tumour that size before			2
but the expert volunteer crew , which included @entity46 anaesthetist dr @entity45 , from @entity88 , overcame the obstacles and were able to perform the procedure			2
speaking ahead of his operation @entity0 said : ' i know without surgery i will die			2
i know i might die in surgery , but i already feel dead inside from the way i 'm treated			0
i choose to have surgery ' due to the size of the tumour the medical team on board the ship @entity99 faced difficulties screening @entity0 before his operation speaking after the operation , dr @entity45 , told @entity107 : ' @entity0 is one patient who i know i will remember forever			1
' our surgical and anaesthetic team achieved something quite incredible , considering his age and the size of the tumour			0
' it is amazing to think that this was made possible on a ship docked in the port of @entity38 - it is a wonderful thing to be a part of			0
' in terms of recovery , @entity0 has a long way to go			0
' from the hospital staff , the on board crew , and the local day crew - hundreds of people have dedicated themselves to transforming @entity0 's life , and this is something that will continue while he recovers			1
' when @entity0 caught sight of himself in the mirror for the first time since his operation , he was delighted			2
he exclaimed : ' i like it			0
' later that morning he was giving the thumbs up , and by the afternoon he was able to sit up in bed and play cards with his grandson			0
he will remain on the ship for the next few months to recover from his surgery			0
the grandfather first heard about the hospital ships through a friend			0
but the team persevered and following a 12 - hour operation @entity0 was finally free of the tumour seeing himself in the mirror for the first time since the operation he exclaimed his delight , telling his grandson : ' i am happy ' there and then he made the decision to visit the crew of the @entity99 , with his grandson to see if they could help			1
they walked for three days , before embarking on a four - hour car journey to reach the ship			1
@entity160 , executive director of @entity16 @entity46 , said : ' thanks to the expert skill of our amazing volunteers @entity16 are able to carry out such incredible , life - changing surgeries			1
' i am so touched to hear about @entity0 's story â€“ he really epitomises what the charity is all about			1
' @entity16 operates the @entity99 , a state - of - the - art hospital ship which carries out life - changing surgeries in some of the poorest countries in the world			1
the ship is currently docked in @entity39 , providing medical care to the world 's forgotten poor			2
