@entity0 remains convinced @entity1 will not be dragged into a relegation dogfight despite a run of one win in 10 games			1
the @entity1 boss admitted ' we could and should have won ' the last five games in the wake of saturday 's dismal 1 - 1 draw with @entity11 at @entity12			1
@entity1 's only win since september was a 3 - 1 triumph over @entity15 , but since then the south @entity16 have drawn with @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity11 , and lost at home to @entity20			1
@entity0 is confident @entity1 wo n't be relegated despite falling to one point from the bottom three palace captain @entity22 congratulates @entity23 after he scored the opener against @entity11 the @entity1 now sit just one point off the relegation zone , but @entity0 is unfazed by his side 's recent missed opportunities			1
' i still think we 've got enough to be okay , ' said @entity0			2
' i do n't think you can write us off against anybody			0
' that 's five games where we could and should have won really			0
' so we 've just got to convert more of our opportunities			0
' we have got to create chances , get two or three players in the transfer window as quickly as possible , and then take it forward			1
' @entity23 claimed his first goal for @entity1 in 15 appearances since his switch from @entity42 , but @entity43 struck almost immediately to level for @entity11			1
neither side could then carve out another clear opening in a dour contest between two teams struggling for fluency			0
@entity49 led @entity1 's forward line against @entity11 , linking play well but never offering a credible goal threat			2
@entity23 ( second left ) puts @entity1 ahead of @entity11 on saturday but @entity54 's side could n't hold on @entity43 's goal means @entity1 have just one win in the last 10 matches the @entity59 striker picked up a thigh problem that could sideline him for several weeks , and @entity0 has made no secret of his desire to sign a striker in january			1
@entity1 have only mustered three goals in their last four games , but @entity0 is unconcerned by his side 's lack of finishing power			2
the former @entity70 boss is adamant @entity1 are still heading in the right direction , claiming he is satisfied with the @entity1 ' creativity			2
' the problem is when you 're not creating and you 're not playing well , ' said @entity0			0
' you 're really snookered then			0
' but i feel we 've got good balance , decent creativity and we 've just not taken our opportunities			0
' and we 're coming across some good goalkeepers at the minute , so i 've got no complaints from the lads at all			0
