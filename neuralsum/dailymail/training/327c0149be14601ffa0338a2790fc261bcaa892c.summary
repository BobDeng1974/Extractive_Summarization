the tiny cephalopods are notoriously hard to rear because they outgrow food sources quickly , have a cannabilistic nature and need specific water requirements			1
just one in 100 of the @entity14 @entity13 squid survive in the wild so experts gathered double that number of eggs from the @entity19 when they tried to breed them in the @entity4			1
baby squid have been successfully bred at an aquarium for the first time ever in @entity4			2

@entity14 @entity26 in @entity27 - are notoriously hard to rear			1
they outgrow food sources quickly , have a cannabilistic nature and need specific water requirement			0
the squid only live for six months and in that time will grow to just over 1ft			2
they are widely eaten , and often used in sushi			0
out of the 200 eggs that hatched 35 of the little creatures have gone on to survive in a special alarmed tank that alerts keepers to any problems			1
they have since grown from a tiny 2mm to just over an inch			0
the @entity14 @entity26 in @entity27 - grow so quickly that their demand for food is incredibly difficult to keep up with			1
they survive on plankton and tiny shrimp but are known to eat one another should they become hungry enough			2
aquarists at the @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity52 , have created a system of tanks so that the bigger squid can be separated from the others in an attempt to avoid this			1

@entity61 , an aquarist at @entity50 , said : ' there is a long way to go and we will undoubtedly lose a few more yet			1

the tiny @entity14 @entity68 are notoriously hard to rear because they outgrow food sources quickly , and have a cannibalistic nature			1
' but with 35 having made it through the delicate first few weeks the chances that we 'll get some through to maturity are very good			0
' they flourish best in small groups , but are also notorious cannibals , so i have to monitor them carefully and separate any that fail to grow as quick as the rest			0
' our goal is to complete the lifecyle , to rear enough adults to produce more eggs , and then rear a second generation			0
' all of this will be done behind - the - scenes in quarantine tanks with water flow systems that prevent the squid touching the sides and potentially damaging their delicate bodies			0
' the next stage will then be to develop suitable clear tanks for them which will enable us to display these amazing creatures			0
' a baby squid produces ink , a type of protein , as a defence mechanism			0
the squid only live for six months and in that time will grow to 1.1 feet			0
35 of the cephalopods have survived in a special alarmed tank at the @entity110 in @entity51 , @entity52 , that alerts keepers to any problems .			1
