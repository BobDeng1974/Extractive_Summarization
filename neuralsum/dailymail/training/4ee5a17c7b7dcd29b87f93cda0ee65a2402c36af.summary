@entity0 insists he did not dismiss the @entity1 during his time in charge at @entity4 - despite a dismal record in the competition throughout his tenure at @entity8			1
the 53 - year - old takes his @entity11 side to another former employer as the @entity11 face a tough fourth - round tie at @entity14 on saturday , having already matched his win record at @entity4 following victory over @entity17 in his first game in charge			1
with cup humiliation coming with defeat at @entity22 in 2010 and @entity23 knocking out the @entity24 twice in successive years , many could point an accusatory finger at @entity0 for his approach to the competition			2
@entity0 insists he did not dismiss the @entity1 during his time in charge at @entity4 a 2 - 1 success against @entity29 in 2012 was his only victory in the competition in a four - year spell on @entity32 , which came to an end when he left in december to fill the managerial vacancy at @entity36			1
but @entity0 maintains he always gave his best and understood what delivering silverware to a trophy - starved @entity4 fan - base would have meant to the city			2
' that is the perception but it was n't the case , ' he said when asked if he took the competition lightly in the past			0
' it was just at times we were unlucky in terms with selection of teams			0
we had a couple of bad results in that competition and , of course , the way it is with cups and their longing for a trophy after all these years , the hurt at going out was magnified each time			0
under @entity0 , @entity4 lost to @entity23 in successive seasons in the @entity1 ' unfortunately i have to accept that but i can assure you we did n't plan for it			1
i have always done the same with cups			0
' i have tried to make sure the team is competitive and sometimes you do have to look within your squad and give people the opportunity , as we did at @entity17			0
then hopefully you find out things about players , sometimes for the good and sometimes for the not			0
' @entity0 does hold fonder memories of cup runs both as a player and a manager , having reached the final of the showpiece event during his time in the @entity11 midfield			2
@entity0 has won all three games since taking charge at his old club @entity11 he scored the winning goal in the 4 - 3 semi-final victory over @entity85 in 1990 and played both the final and the replay as the @entity11 were pipped to the trophy by @entity89			1
and he would suffer final heart - break 16 years later when he took @entity91 to the @entity92 , with the @entity91 taking the lead twice against @entity85 before @entity94 equalised in injury time and led the @entity96 to a penalty shoot - out victory			0
and now , if he can lead @entity11 to an unlikely win over high - flying @entity14 at the weekend , @entity0 will have already eclipsed his @entity4 record in the cup and will be dreaming of going one better than in 1990 and 2006 .			1

@entity0 won just one @entity1 match while in charge of @entity4
but the @entity11 boss said he was just unlucky
he *denied* *suggestions* he does n't care about the competition
