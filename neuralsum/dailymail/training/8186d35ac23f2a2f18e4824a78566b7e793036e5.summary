he said : ' to do it safely , we both needed to release from the glider together , at a very precise moment , to ensure we would n't fall into the glider			0
' we are not so good at this type of thing as we are at paragliding so it was necessary to feel comfortable in the air to do the slingshot properly			0
so in order to prepare for the moment , the paragliders both spent seven hours training in a wind tunnel he added : ' we took the hot air balloon to about 4,500 metres , and exited by letting the glider hang out of the basket , then tumbling over it			1
the pair first took a hot air balloon to 14,700 feet , before securing themselves to a paraglider which they later sling - shotted out of to perform the daring stunt , mr @entity6 said they both needed to be perfectly in sync to ensure they would n't fall into the glider after hurling themselves over the edge of the hot air balloon at almost 15,000 feet , the pair launched into a series of somersaults five - time @entity44 and world record holder mr @entity6 said it 's one of the ' coolest ' things he 's ever done ' at 3,900 metres we did about 13 revolutions and then after 13 , we released , at around 3,400 metres			1
' then it was a simple sky - dive to the landing at 2,000 metres , at the ski resort of @entity91			2
' mr @entity6 is a pioneer of aerobatic paragliding , which he began learning at the age of 14 as he watched his cousin 's fly at his uncle ’s paragliding school in the @entity7 industrial aviation hub of @entity100			2
at 18 , he entered his first competition , one of the very few synchronised aerobatic paragliding tournaments that existed in those days , as the discipline was regarded as too dangerous			0
