he told the jury : ' this case concerns the dishonest extraction of several million pounds from payments of investors who were all promised rich rewards for their investments			1
' the proceeds were laundered , converted and transferred to cash between 2004 and 2007			2
' individual members of the public began to receive unsolicited telephone calls from people purporting to be brokers and were convinced to invest substantial amounts of money , often through a hard sell , into various companies			1
' they were all told they would quickly make handsome profits as their companies were due to be floated on the @entity87			2
' it is alleged the gang spent the money on luxury cars including a @entity32 , like the one pictured but none of the companies were in fact floated and none the investors received any profit - they simply lost their money , the court heard			1
' this type of trick involving the dishonest selling of worthless shares is colloquially known as a boiler room fraud , ' mr @entity60 said			0
' there term is used to describe high pressure sales techniques often targeting elderly and vulnerable victims			1
' a large number of victims in this case were subjected to high pressure sells and repeated calls until they agreed to invest			0
' one 87 - year - old gentleman , mr @entity115 , unfortunately parted with £ 828,000 investing in most of the companies			1
' many of the elderly victims are not fools by any stretch of the imagination ; they are all successful , responsible individuals who eventually gave in to sales patter			1

' the floor book gives us a very interesting picture into how many victims we are talking about			0
' but we have to approach it with some caution because the fraud was going on before the start date and after the end date , in fact to early 2007			0
' some people on here were tricked again to con more money out of them			1
there are also very many victims who are not on this book at all			0
' the book has in excess of 1000 names , 600 of which handed over money for investment			0
they did n't all hand over money , but hundreds did			0
' the floor book records around £ 6million worth of investment and marks as received a figure in the region of £ 3million			2
' but what the bank accounts show is what was actually received that can in fact be traced back to the floor book - around £ 2.7million			1
