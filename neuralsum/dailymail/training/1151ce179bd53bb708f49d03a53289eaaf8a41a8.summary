a six - year - old schoolgirl spent more than five years with a hole in her heart before the life - threatening condition was discovered when her parents thought she had a cold			1
@entity7 from @entity8 was only given the diagnosis of having a an atrial septal defect after she was taken to her gp by her grandmother @entity12 , who thought she was suffering from a common cold			1
the grandmother , 55 , had become concerned about @entity7 when the youngster fell ill during a drama class at her school and took her to see a doctor , who discovered a murmur			1
six - year - old @entity7 from @entity8 with her grandmother @entity12 , who is recovering from open heart surgery after it was discovered she had been living with a 2.5cm hole in her heart the youngster , who lives with her sister @entity24 at her grandmother 's home was then referred to @entity28 's @entity27 , where it was found she was living with the serious heart defect , called atrial septal defect ( @entity31 )			1
almost immediately , she was then whisked off for life - saving open heart surgery , which involved repairing the 2.5cm hole with mesh			1
mrs @entity7 , an assistant medical administrator , said : ' i took @entity7 to see the gp after the incident in school and he picked up a mumur			2
' we were referred to the hospital but were assured it would be nothing serious but then the cardiologist said : " you do realise @entity7 has a hole in her heart ? " ' we could n't believe it			1
the hole was quite a size and we had no idea until it was found by luck			0
@entity7 underwent the operation at the @entity27 in @entity28 after being referred there when her gp diagnosed her with a heart murmur ' we were told that a hole in the heart usually forms at birth , so she will have been living with it her entire life			1
' the hole was found in october and a month later , she was having the surgery			2
' it was a bit of a whirlwind coming round to it after i thought both my granddaughters were fit and healthy			0
@entity7 's family first grew concerned about her health after she repeatedly suffered from colds and fell ill while at school now following the operation @entity7 's grandmother says she was back at school within five weeks and is as ' fit as a fiddle ' ' she seemed absolutely fine for the first five years of her life			1

' they had to stop her heart at one point so it was worrying for me and her family			0
' @entity84 septal defect is a congential heart condition that suffers are born with although the cause is unknown			0
the condition usually means that there is a hole in the upper chambers of the heart , which means that the oxygen - rich and the oxygen - poor blood , instead of being kept separate , are allowed to mix and flow from the heart to the body and lungs			2
children with @entity31 only show mild symptoms but can be prone to more chest infections and can sometimes cause breathlessness and a heart murmur			1
some small defects just require close monitoroing as they can sometimes close on their own			0
however , larger holes require surgery to correct the defect , although after surgery , most children do not need further operations , and go on to lead normal healthy lives			0
a hole in the heart is a defect usually formed from birth which changes the flow of blood through the heart			2
@entity31 is a hole in the upper chambers of the heart and allows blood to pass from one side to the other , with some oxygen - rich blood moving to the lungs instead of the entire body			2
throughout her whole life , @entity12 never saw any reason to be worried about @entity7 's health , except that she suffered the odd cold more than usual			1
she would often attribute the frequency of the colds to @entity7 's pale skin and red hair			0
after @entity7 fell asleep in school , teachers called mrs @entity7 and suggested that her granddaughter may be unwell			0
she spent five days in hospital recovering from her life - saving surgery and is now back to school and living a normal life			1
the 55 - year - old added : ' @entity7 would have runny noses and colds quite often but we thought it was just part of childhood , especially with her being at school around other children			1
' she was back to school within five weeks and now she is fit as a fiddle			2
' when i look at @entity7 now i do see a difference in how much more energy she has			0
' the unit at the @entity154 hospital was fantastic			0
the staff were so supportive and it was an ideal place for @entity7 to have the operation			0
' without them she would still be suffering with a defect that could have endangered her life , so i 'll be eternally grateful to them			0
