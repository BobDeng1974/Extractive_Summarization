@entity8 and @entity7 and their son @entity9 , who confirmed that @entity1 had died two weeks ago , shared the last note they received from her as they appeared on the today show on monday			1
' i am ok , healthy , remaining strong and being treated kindly			2
do not worry ... i love you all , ' she wrote in the undated letter			1
' my heart longs to be with you all as ... i have never felt before , but praise be to @entity21 you are in my dreams almost every evening and for just those brief moments in my sleeping conscious that we are together i am given a warmth			1
they confirmed her death earlier this month ' it 's warmth enough for me to wake with a smile			1
warmth enough to keep me company through the days , and warmth enough to keep my heart near to home and therefore to @entity21			2
' @entity1 , who grew up in @entity40 , @entity41 , was captured in august 2013 after leaving a @entity43 hospital in @entity44 , @entity45 as she visited her boyfriend , who was @entity45			1
on february 10 , @entity1 's family and @entity49 officials confirmed that she had died			1
the @entity51 group claimed the 26 - year - old international aid worker had died in a @entity54 airstrike , but that has not been confirmed			1
the @entity56 said it did n't know how she was killed			2
her family shared the note as they spoke about their daily battle after she was captured ; they worked hard to keep her name out of the press because they feared for her safety			1
her brother said her situation worsened after the government traded five @entity71 commanders for a captive @entity49 soldier last may			1
the militants increased their demands after the @entity49 swapped @entity76 sergeant @entity75			1
missed : @entity1 , 26 , was kidnapped while in @entity45 in august 2013 and @entity3 said she died during an airstrike in @entity54 , but that has not been confirmed by @entity49 officials			1
@entity3 told the family about her death by email final words : her family shared this letter - her last from captivity			1
she assured them she was being treated kindly but said that she missed them and often felt a ' warmth ' when she thought about tem ' that made the whole situation worse because that 's when the demands got greater , ' he said			2
they realized that they had something			0
' his father , @entity97 , said that the @entity49 ' willingness to swap for @entity75 but not pay ransom or allow ransom to be paid for his daughter ' was pretty hard to take '			1
' i actually asked the president that question when we were in the @entity107 , ' @entity97 said without elaborating			0
they said they had been instructed to pay $ 6.2 million for @entity1 's release but even if they had been able to raise the money , @entity49 government policy would have prohibited them from paying the ransom			1
' i really feel that we had a chance to get @entity1 out , ' said her father @entity8 , who called his daughter ' @entity118 ' - short for ' @entity120 '			1
' we were in communications with them , unlike other families			0
but how do you raise $ 6.2 million ? you know , it pretty much made it impossible			0
' he went on : ' we understand the policy about not paying ransom , but on the other hand , any parents out there would understand that you would want anything and everything done to bring your child home			2
and we tried , and we asked			0
but they put policy in front of @entity49 citizens ' lives			1
and it did n't get it changed			0
' @entity146 officials have repeatedly said that the government does not pay ransoms to @entity3 or exchange prisoners with the militant group			0
' the @entity49 government policy , in terms of how we operate , is we do n't make concessions to terrorists			1
that is our policy , ' spokeswoman @entity156 said during a news conference in january			0
disappointment : her mother said she often expected @entity1 to walk through the door , as the family said they wished @entity49 government policy had allowed them to do more to help their daughter questions : they said that when the @entity49 government swapped five @entity71 fighters for captive soldier @entity75 ( pictured ) last may , the militants holding @entity1 made greater demands some @entity49 lawmakers were outraged by the exchange of five @entity71 commanders held at the @entity176 for @entity75 , an @entity177 native who left his post in @entity179 and was captured and held by the @entity71 for five years			1
president @entity181 's administration has defended the swap			0
the @entity183 unanimously supported the exchange , insisting that the @entity49 has a sacred commitment to men and women who serve that it will never leave anyone behind on the battlefield			1
meanwhile , @entity1 's mother said that she was still ' in denial ' about her daughter 's death			1
' i still expect @entity1 to come through the door , ' @entity7 said			1
' we always had that little bit of hope that we would always get her home			0
' the family also unveiled a new foundation set up in her memory , @entity204 , devoted to the causes that she felt passionate about			0
' she had to be busy with her hands doing something to help people , ' her mother said			0
' and as long as she was , she was just joyful			0
she just did n't have enough power as one little person			0
maybe we can get the world behind her , or at least behind @entity204			0
' on the today show on monday , the @entity1 family shared the final letter they received from @entity1 while she was imprisoned			1
the letter does not have a date			2
