details of a sex - change operation carried out in the 18th century have been uncovered , in what may be one of the earliest instances of gender - reassignment surgery			1
a pamphlet called ‘ the case of the boy who had been mistaken for a girl ; with three anatomical views of the parts , before and after the operation and cure ’ by surgeon @entity14 has been uncovered			1
it describes how the sex - change operation was carried out , the @entity16 website reports			1
the pamphlet , published in 1787 , describes how the parents of a seven - year - old brought their to child to him with a ' complaint in the groin '			1
he said : at first it seemed to be the female organs with an imperforated hymen ; but , on more close examination , it was discovered that the part , which had the appearance of the labia pudenda , was in fact the scrotum , divided by its septum			2
’ mr @entity14 said he ‘ performed an operation to free the penis from its confinement ’ which involved ' a longditudinal incision on each size of the penis , as close to the pubis as could be admitted with safety			1
' the ' cure ' went on ' favourably ' , he added			0
after operating on the young child , whose name is unknown , mr @entity14 said the child was able ‘ to urinate standing up , wear trousers , and enjoy the privileges of being a male			1
’ the pamphlet contains no mention of either the patient nor his parents being consulted			0
however he did not view the operation as a sex change , but as a way of returning the child to his ‘ proper ’ gender			2
denying that hermaphrodites exist , he said : ‘ the term “ hermaphrodite ” is properly understood as an animal that has both the male and female organs equally and perfectly formed			2
but there is not reason to believe that such a case ever had existence in the human subject			2
’ the pamphlet describes the case of a ' girl ' brought to mr @entity14 with a ' complaint in the groin			1
he later discovered the child ws actually male he concluded that if the patient had been of the upper classes , the case would have been a lot more interesting			2
the pamphlet is eight pages long , with three illustrations of the child ’s anatomy , and may describe on of the earliest instances of sex - change surgery			1
it was discovered by @entity101 , a professor of sociology at the @entity103 , who found it when she was researching the history of electricity in the college ’s rare books library			1
the story has now been published as a study the @entity111			0
' i was looking through a bunch of materials that had been shoved together and this one appeared ' , she told @entity16 journalist @entity117			0
@entity118 , author of ' bodies in @entity120 : an @entity121 ' and professor of women ’s and gender studies at the @entity125 told ms @entity117 that she had not come across any earlier examples of gender reassignment surgery			0
‘ the first case i found ( in @entity129 ) was in the 1840s , and it was received quite critically by fellow physicians ’ @entity132 , a professor of the @entity133 at @entity134 added that @entity14 was ‘ not a quack ’			2
while sex - changes were unusual , the operation fits in with the historical record for surgeries carried out at the time , prof @entity132 said			1
she said : ‘ certainly this is unusual for the time period			0
‘ in the late eighteenth century , people were doing a little more adventuresome surgery			0
‘ that ’s the kind of operative surgery they were doing at that point			0
it ’s not invading a body cavity			0
it ’s not opening up the abdomen or chest			0
people would n’t have survived that			0
