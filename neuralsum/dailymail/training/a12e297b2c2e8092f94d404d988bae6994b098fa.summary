by @entity1 reporter published : 09:25 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 09:31 est , 11 july 2013 police could have prevented the @entity5 bombings if they had been more vigorous in their investigation into a grisly 2011 triple murder that @entity8 was connected to , it was alleged today			1
law enforcement authorities have accused local cops of botching the investigation after @entity8 was flagged up to them numerous times in the wake of the killings and they failed to act on it			2
had they apprehended him , the bombings that left three dead and more than 260 wounded may never have happened , sources believe			0
on september 12 , 2011 , @entity18 , 25 , @entity18 , 31 , and @entity18 , 37 , were found in an apartment with their throats slit and marijuana sprinkled over their bodies			1
there was no sign of forced entry and $ 5,000 cash was still in the apartment			0
involved ? @entity28 , left , and @entity29 , right , could have been involved in a 2011 triple murder , investigators have said			2
forensic evidence and cell phone records reportedly tie them to the scene investigators at the time said the murders were ' targeted and not a random act of violence ' yet no one was ever charged in the case			1
following the bombings , local investigators started looking at a connection with @entity8 as he and @entity18 had become close friends after training together in a boxing and martial arts gym			1
when they did , they found forensic evidence from the crime scene that matched the @entity8 brothers and cell phones records show they were in the area at the time of the killings			1

according to the @entity69 , federal investigators had been gathering information against @entity8 even before questioning @entity71 using ' old - fashioned ' police work			1
they ' went through his phone , did interviews , got his contacts - a combination of all that ' , a senior law enforcement official said			0
during the initial investigation , police concluded the murders were a professional job as a result of a low - level drug dispute			0
this was due to the lack of evidence , the savageness of the attack and the position of the bodies - all stomach down with their heads turned to the side			0
but relatives and friends of the victims have criticized this decision and said investigators failed to do basic policing work , especially after @entity8 was named a number of times and was known to be a frequent visitor to the @entity105 apartment			1
but three law enforcement officials familiar with the case told the @entity69 that @entity109 state troopers and the @entity105 police never questioned him - either as a potential suspect or as someone who could provide valuable information about the victims			2
it was when @entity8 did not show up to mess ' funeral and seemed to show a lack of emotion when talking about it , that mutual friends became uneasy and reported it to police			1
one friend , who did not want to be identified , said : ' i felt that the police were not really looking in the right places			2
' i told them there were only two @entity127 i knew of who hung around the group of friends , and because of the 9/11 date , the fact that @entity8 and @entity18 ’s last girlfriend were @entity127 stood out			2
' murdered : @entity18 ( left with a friend ) and @entity18 ( right ) were also killed in the home scene : investigators said there was no sign of forced entry so it is likely the men knew their murderers after the murders no one went to the @entity146 martial arts gym where @entity18 worked out with @entity8 - and later @entity71			1
@entity147 , the gym ’s owner who first flagged up the men 's friendship , said he was shocked by @entity8 's reaction to his friend 's murder when they talked about it a few days later			1
' as i said something , there was kind of a smile on @entity8 ’s face , and he laughed it off ' , he said			2
he laughed off the fact that he was murdered , like : " aw , man			0
it ’s crazy right ? huh huh			0
it ’s crazy right ? i guess if you do that , that ’s what ’s going to happen "			0
' there was no hint of grief , that really shocked me			0
' @entity18 ' girlfriend , who also did not want to be identified , said she told investigators that @entity8 , who she knew as ' @entity176 ' , was at the @entity105 apartment regularly but they also did not allegedly follow up			2
when questioned by the @entity69 a law enforcement official denied they were told about @entity8 saying : ' do n’t you think if someone had told us to take a look at him and that he had information , we would have talked to him ?
