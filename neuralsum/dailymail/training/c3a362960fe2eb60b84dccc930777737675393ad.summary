by @entity0 published : 19:05 est , 26 january 2014 updated : 06:40 est , 29 january 2014 @entity0 runs you through what we learned from the weekend 's football ... with some star turns and a look through the leagues , too			0
this week includes @entity9 failing to make an impact against @entity11 , @entity12 continuing to frustrate and @entity14 's resurrection under @entity15			1
1 ) @entity9 ’s £ 12million move to @entity17 has been an 18 - month nightmare of niggling injuries and lack of action even when he has been fit			1
the 22 - year - old has changed his car and moved house to try to solve his persistent hamstring problems since leaving @entity26			2
struggled : @entity9 ( right ) did not play well against @entity11 and was hauled off at half - time any hope that getting picked against @entity11 in the @entity29 might turn the tide for him proved a big let down , however			1
@entity31 said he wished he could have subbed all 11 players at half time when the @entity35 side were leading 2 - 0 – but it was @entity9 and @entity37 who were the pair that did get the hook			1
fight back : @entity41 's second - half hat - trick brought @entity17 back from two goals down to win 4 - 2 2 ) @entity43 celebrated his 41st birthday back in october but continues to justify @entity46 ’s decision to give him a one - year contract as cover to @entity49			1
the 1 - 0 win over @entity51 meant the 6ft 5in goalkeeper has now kept five clean sheets in his six appearances since moving to @entity55			0
that ’s one more than @entity57 , who ditched him in the summer after signing @entity60 despite his 220 appearances , have managed all season			0
unbeatable : @entity46 's reserve goalkeeper @entity43 has kept five clean sheets in six matches since moving to @entity55 3 ) @entity67 manager @entity66 made six changes for the clash with @entity70 to give some stars a break before this week ’s @entity73 matches with @entity74 and @entity57			1
but one man who did n’t get rested was newly - capped @entity77 striker @entity76 , who played all 90 minutes of the 2 - 0 win over @entity35 side @entity70			1
the 24 - year - old , who won his first @entity77 cap in the november friendly against @entity82 , has appeared in every one of @entity67 ’ games in all competitions this season			0
the hamstring injury which kept @entity87 out of @entity26 ’s win at @entity89 means @entity76 is now one of only three @entity73 players who have appeared in every one of their club ’s first - team games			1
the other two are @entity95 ’s @entity94 and @entity51 skipper @entity96 – the only man to have started every match			0
key man : @entity76 is one of just three @entity73 players who have appeared in every one of their club 's first team games this season 4 ) winger @entity14 played a key role in @entity104 ’s promotion side but struggled to adapt to the demands of @entity73 football – it was mid-december before he started a game			1
but the 26 - year - old from @entity110 , who has worked his way up from playing non-league football with @entity114 , looks like being a key man under @entity116			1
he was one of the stars of the show in the 1 - 0 win at @entity120 , and has played in all the club ’s last eight matches			0
revitalised : @entity14 ( left ) has been given a new lease of life under @entity15 5 ) @entity12 continues to be the most frustrating player in football			1
sent on for the last 23 minutes by @entity57 boss @entity127 following a red card for @entity130 skipper @entity129 , he gave the ball away the first five times he touched it			2
the @entity135 ’s loan move from @entity136 has brought him just one goal , right back in august against @entity138			0
at least @entity57 rescued a replay against 10 - man @entity140 on this occasion			1
the other five matches when @entity12 has been brought on from the bench have all ended in defeats			2
frustrating : @entity12 had no impact after being introduced against 10 - man @entity130 6 ) @entity149 skipper @entity148 has been linked with big clubs including @entity74 but looks likely to stay at the @entity151 when the window shuts this week			1
that ’s good news for @entity156 boss @entity155 , whatever the ambitions of the 29 - year - old captain of @entity159			2
he played @entity160 almost on his own in the first half at @entity163 ’s – making five vital blocks including two goal - line clearances			2
top performer : @entity149 skipper @entity148 ( left ) was excellent against @entity160 , making vital blocks and two goal - line clearances 7 ) @entity169 striker @entity168 appointed himself penalty taker for this campaign after watching youngster @entity172 miss the one at @entity11 that cost the @entity174 a place in last year ’s play - off final			1
the 28 - year - old has been deadly , with nine successful spot kicks so far – just one short of @entity180 ’s club record for penalties in a season set way back in 1953			2
he should have reached that milestone on saturday , but are nerves setting in ? his tame effort was easily saved by @entity187 ’s @entity186			0
8 ) @entity189 ’s starring role in @entity191 ’s 2 - 0 win over @entity192 was a reward for his determination to rescue his career after it all went wrong at @entity196			0
the 32 - year - old @entity198 midfielder signed at @entity199 in november on a short - term deal where he did n’t earn a penny unless he got picked for the @entity204 ’s team			2
he ’s now started two games and @entity191 have won them both , and he ’s been given a proper contract that lasts until the end of the season			0
impact : @entity189 had a starring role in @entity191 's 2 - 0 win over @entity192 9 ) @entity213 ’s tradition for open football , long established by @entity215 , comes with huge risks			0
they defended better in the 1 - 0 defeat at @entity219 which left them just a point above the relegation zone in @entity223 , having played two more games than 21st placed @entity130			1
but their goal difference is now an astonishing minus 27 – the worst of any of the 92 clubs			0
@entity73 @entity57 are on minus 26			0
10 ) they say teams reflect their manager , and @entity231 are a good example given the reputation for commitment and determination their boss @entity236 gained in his playing days at @entity237 and @entity238			2
they won 4 - 2 at @entity240 to go third in @entity241 , despite putting up with an hour ’s delay to kick off while torrential rain was cleared from the pitch , and then scoring two own goals			0
@entity236 ’s side will need the same character again tonight			0
with barely 48 hours break they travel to face leaders @entity250 for the benefit of the monday night tv cameras .			0

@entity9 struggled against @entity11 and was substituted at half - time
@entity12 did nothing when introduced against 10 - man @entity130
@entity14 back into the @entity104 team under @entity15
@entity46 reserve keeper @entity43 proves the old ones are good ones
