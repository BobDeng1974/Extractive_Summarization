one of those odd shapes , oddly enough , was the shape of a giant butterfly			0
they shared this news , and how it is these delicate winged creatures were detected as a cloud , on their @entity43 page last week			0

bigger and better : the size of the swarm of butterflies is good news for the species , whose numbers had begun to drop recently in @entity48 due to habitat loss and extreme weather the orange and black beauties will now fly thousands of miles south and , hopefully , make the trip back north come @entity63			1
as for the western @entity48 population of @entity66 , they never actually leave the country , heading from the @entity68 to sunny @entity69 come winter .			0
