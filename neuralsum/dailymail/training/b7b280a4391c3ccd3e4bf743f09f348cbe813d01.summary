by @entity0 pay row : @entity2 arrives at @entity3 in @entity4 yesterday @entity5 was last night accused of a ‘ constitutional outrage ’ after he demoted the woman chosen to be new leader of the @entity9			2
the upper house was united in anger after it emerged @entity13 would not be a full member of the @entity15 – unlike her predecessor			1
the appointment was already controversial after it emerged she would be paid £ 22,000 less than @entity18 , who is moving on to be the @entity21 ’s next @entity20 commissioner			1
@entity3 officials were left red - faced when it was revealed she would receive less for doing the same job as a man in a reshuffle supposed to promote women			0
they hurriedly announced her pay would be topped up by the @entity31			0
but this too has provoked outrage in the upper house			0
yesterday @entity9 demanded to know how she could represent the whole house – as her role demands – when she is part paid by a political party			2
they pointed to @entity9 standing orders – the rules of the chamber – which demand the leader of the house should be a full member of the @entity15			1
the new arrangement will see her attend meetings but not have @entity15 status , breaking , it was claimed , a precedent dating back 112 years			2
yesterday @entity49 referred the appointment to a powerful constitutional committee and it was condemned by peers from all parties amid near riotous scenes in the @entity9			2
mr @entity5 defended the arrangement at @entity57 ’s questions , saying : ‘ i ’m happy to confirm that she will do the same job as her predecessor , will sit in the same place around the table as her predecessor , and will receive the same money			0
’ @entity42 in the @entity65 said @entity2 ’s lack of full @entity15 status showed contempt for the house			1
she described the salary top - up as ‘ improper and unethical ’			0
@entity71 rejects @entity72 and @entity73 cooking up trouble for pm ? she added : ‘ when i heard about this yesterday , i simply did not believe it could be true , but when it was then confirmed later in the day , i was deeply dismayed that the prime minister could treat this house with such contempt			0
’ former @entity49 attorney general @entity81 called on mr @entity5 to reconsider			0
she told @entity2 : ‘ will you convey to him in the strongest possible way that it is this house ’s view that he has committed what amounts to a constitutional outrage that this house does not accept			0
’ the debate was prompted by an urgent question from former @entity92 cabinet minister @entity91 , who said it was vital the leader of the @entity9 was a full member of the @entity15			1
he said : ‘ what sort of signal does that send to the civil service and others about the authority of this place in its important duty in revising legislation ? ’ on tuesday , @entity3 confirmed that @entity2 would be paid the @entity9 ’ minister of state salary of £ 78,891 a year , compared with £ 101,038 for her predecessor			1
the fall was due to a legal limit on the number of full @entity15 posts and the reshuffle meant there were not enough seats to go around .			1

@entity13 would have been paid £ 22,000 less than predecessor
under rules of chamber leader must be full @entity15 member
one peer said move shows ' contempt ' for the @entity9
