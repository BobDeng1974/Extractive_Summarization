@entity0 has opened negotiations for @entity2 to challenge new world heavyweight champion sensation @entity3			1
if this agreement can be reached quickly , @entity0 might even be prepared to pay step - aside money to @entity2 's scheduled opponent @entity6 in their @entity8 title defence at the @entity10 on february 28			1
@entity0 will probably seek to book either @entity11 or the @entity12 in @entity13 for what he calls ' the biggest and most exciting fight out there in the world today , apart from @entity18 vs @entity19 '			1

@entity2 himself said : ' the ideal for me would be to beat @entity6 , take the majority of those belts off @entity25 and then meet @entity3 to become the undisputed champion			1
but if @entity3 says he will fight me next , i will take that rather than hang about waiting for @entity25			0
' @entity0 believes that @entity36 would be an even bigger box office sensation than a fight with @entity25			0
' @entity3 has brought the heavyweight division out of the doldrums , and back to life			0
him against @entity2 would be the most exciting event to promote for me , bar none			0
' the plan is still to pin down @entity25 and not let him duck @entity2 but @entity3 would be huge			2
@entity42 and @entity2 lead the heavyweight renaissance in 2015			0

he adds : ' with the greatest respect to @entity6 , if @entity3 were to confirm this week i would pay him off			2
in a way it 's a compliment , because we would have to ask ourselves , why take the risk ? ' why do that before the biggest income , the biggest live gate from a biggest tv heavyweight fight that could possibly happen ? it will fill any football ground			0
' @entity6 sounded convinced when he said ' people in @entity69 think i am mad , travelling over here to fight @entity2 but i believe i could beat him on points '			2
@entity2 says : ' i do n't think anyone in this room thinks he can beat me any more than i could beat @entity75 in a 100metre sprint			0
but running is not heavyweight boxing in which one punch can cause a big upset			0
