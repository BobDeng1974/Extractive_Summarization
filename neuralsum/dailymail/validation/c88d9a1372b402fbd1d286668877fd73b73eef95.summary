a group of fishermen in @entity2 , @entity3 , got a nasty surprise when a crocodile surfaced and stole their catch off the end of the line			1
the men appeared to have hooked a barramundi and were reeling it in when the massive mass of sharp teeth and scale got the jump on them			2
thrilled with the seeming size of their catch , one of the fisherman is heard saying ' he 's a good fish , mate ' to another man off camera			0
' did you get it yet , @entity29 ? ' @entity30 , who filmed the catch , can be heard asking just seconds before the dinosauric creature made its entrance			0
with one swift swipe the croc had knicked the catch from the fishermen , who were left to marvel at their close encounter , and be thankful they had n't been hanging a limb over the edge of the boat within biting range			2
