in a meeting tuesday afternoon with executives and lawyers from 14 media companies , attorney general @entity0 acknowledged that he and his team ' are not satisfied ' with the way search warrants for reporters ' phone records and emails were executed in cases involving leaks of classified information			1
referring to his own agency 's description of @entity17 reporter @entity16 as a possible criminal co-conspirator for reporting information leaked to him by a @entity21 source , @entity0 said he was ‘ not comfortable with that characterization of mr. @entity16			1
’ ‘ he was n’t aiding he enemy , ' the attorney general said			1
' he was just reporting news			0
’ ' there was no chance he was ever going to be prosecuted , ' @entity0 added			1
‘ i find it incomprehensible that it ever would happen			0
@entity17 reporter @entity16 's case has become a rallying cry for journalists concerned about government interference with the @entity47 @entity0 told the @entity48 on thursday that his agency had no plans to prosecute reporters involved in leak scandals			1
' @entity53 [ of justice ] has not prosecuted , and as long as i 'm attorney general , will not prosecute any reporter for doing his or her job , ' he said			1
in tuesday 's closed meeting , @entity0 addressed the cases involving @entity17 and the @entity60 , in which the @entity36 obtained search warrants for reporters ' records and emails without notifying the media companies they work for			1
in @entity16 's case , @entity0 personally approved a warrant that leaned on the @entity69 in order to satisfy technicalities in the @entity72			1
that latter statute requires notification of media outlets before the federal government can interfere with journalists , unless certain conditions are met			0
one of those exceptions is the formal identification of a reporter as a criminal suspect			0
the @entity36 asserted to a federal judge that @entity16 himself was an investigative target , and could be criminally liable for publishing state secrets which harmed the @entity31			1
that claim , once made , persuaded a judge to approve the warrant			0
@entity0 is now under fire for telling the @entity90 that he was wholly unfamiliar with any ‘ potential prosecution ’ of reporters in cases like these , testimony that @entity90 is investigating as possible perjury			1
deputy attorney general @entity96 explained that regulations under which the @entity36 operates require him to determine -- before notifying a media company that a reporter 's records are the subject of a warrant -- that the disclosure will not jeopardize an ongoing investigation			1
that , he conceded , put him in the position of having had to prove a negative before notifying the @entity60 or @entity17			2
but when pressed by @entity107 , @entity0 confirmed that there is no legal barrier stopping him from declaring on his own that the @entity36 will no longer withhold that information from publishers and their attorneys			1
‘ we could do that , ’ he said			0
‘ the big guy at @entity116 would have to check the box , but yes , we could			0
’ @entity0 also acknowledged that during the @entity120 presidency , his agency has yet to be ' burned ' by sharing that kind of information with news agencies involved in similar cases			2
and he said that the @entity36 has no other outstanding leak cases involving requests for reporters ' private records			1
@entity0 agreed that president @entity120 could approve a new policy requiring the @entity36 to notify media outlets every time records of journalists are sought in court , even though certain legal situations do n't require it president @entity120 has asked the attorney general for a set of recommendations by july 12 , describing what can and should be done to change the way his agency treats cases that uncover a conflict between press freedom and national security			1
but he was careful to point out that a proposed press shield law , which @entity120 favors , wo n't be a substitute for his own responsiveness to the president			0
' i do n’t want what we do to be tied to the shield law , ’ @entity0 said			0
' and i do n’t think this is brain surgery			0
’ the @entity36 caught flak from reporters last week after inviting them to two similar meetings about press freedoms , and initially insisting that they should be considered ' off the record			0
' that designation demands that journalists refrain from reporting on the event in any way			0
the @entity36 ultimately relented , holding a sparsely attended meeting on friday , after which reporters and editors were permitted to discuss broadly the content of the discussion			2
but of tuesday 's meeting , @entity0 said , ' we were n't intending it to be really " off the record			2
" ' ' i 'm not sure what the status really is , ' he conceded at one point			0
@entity21 contractor @entity175 allegedly leaked state serets to @entity17 reporter @entity16 , setting off a powder keg that has the attorney general 's neck in a congressional guillotine @entity107 attended the meeting			1
attendees on tuesday were asked to ' refrain from talking about specific suggestions ' offered by the group of 20 executives and attorneys , and one working journalist			0
floating those suggestions publicly , a @entity36 official said , could cause workable ideas to fall prey to premature public naysaying			0
that official also asked that the participants refrain from reporting on the content of discussions about ongoing investigations			0
@entity0 's comments , however , make it clear that @entity16 is not the subject of any criminal investigation			2
@entity107 is also refraining from reporting on solutions the group offered to the thorny problem of how to balance national security concerns with journalists ' freedoms guaranteed by the @entity47			2
media organizations in attendance on tuesday were the @entity60 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity17 , the @entity213 , @entity107 , @entity214 , the @entity215 , the @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 and the @entity220 .			2

@entity0 hosted closed meeting of news moguls tuesday as *accusations* *swirled* that he lied to @entity90 about probing @entity17 ' @entity16
executives *objected* to the @entity36 getting permission to *snoop* on reporters in national security leak cases without notifying their *employers*
attorney general conceded that he has the authority to ignore certain legal requirements and notify media companies every time records are sought
' there was no chance he was ever going to be prosecuted , ' @entity0 said , despite approving an affidavit telling a judge @entity16 was a co-conspirator
