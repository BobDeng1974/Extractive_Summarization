the @entity0 remains @entity2 ’s achilles heel			1
the @entity4 trophy which has eluded them most often			2
since beating saturday 's opponents @entity9 in the 1997 - 98 final , the @entity7 club have won it a further four times			1
to supporters of smaller , provincial clubs , that would be a form of nirvana			2
a glorious period of outstanding achievement			2
@entity19 is determined to get his hands on the @entity0 after sunday 's final against @entity9 to @entity2 , it ’s a source of mild failure			1
in the same period the club has captured twice as many league titles			2
and six @entity4 cups the clubs previous two managers , @entity29 and @entity30 , did n’t win the @entity0 at all and @entity30 ’s record in cups was a source of occasional unrest			1
for @entity19 , then , the first trophy of his @entity2 tenure would be hugely significant			1
‘ it is something we would remember for the rest of our lives , ’ said the @entity37			1
‘ @entity0 finals are big			2
they are big in @entity37 and in @entity4 and @entity44			1
’ bold and forthright , @entity19 has publicly pledged to win a @entity47			1
managers usually play down talk of clean sweeps and banish the very words from their vocabulary			1
a fatalistic , superstitious streak runs through @entity4 football , but @entity19 is n’t having it			1
far from piling pressure on himself or his players , he believes it sets a target to strive for			2
@entity2 expect to win all three domestic trophies every season			1
saying so should be no cause for palpitations			2
‘ i am very calm , ’ said @entity19 with a grin			1
hopefully it will come on sunday - but we have so many big matches you get used to it			1
‘ if this had been a small club , the cup final would be totally crazy			1
it would be all : “ who is going to sit here and what are we going to do with the supporters ? ” but this club has done it so many times , so it ’s very calm			2
‘ we just prepare for what ’s ahead of us and i think we can feel in the atmosphere of the players there is a big game coming up			2
again , we can reach one of our targets and that ’s important			0
’ @entity19 issues instructions to his players during the recent @entity91 quarter - final draw with @entity9 in one sense he is correct			1
@entity2 have been in many cup finals , too many to mention			1
‘ in 2010 , @entity95 beat a @entity97 team in the final , ’ he recalled			1
‘ i played in 2001 and won , then lost one in 2002			0
the cup final is big in @entity37 , there is only one cup and , like the @entity103 , it ’s the last game of the season and is always sold out			1
‘ i have seen crazy things at the cup final			1
things like : “ who is going to sit beside the @entity112 ? ” that ’s how it is with small clubs			0
’ he believes @entity2 are favourites to win because they have the bigger squad			1
those options will be diminished if @entity115 , an increasingly influential midfielder , fails to overcome a swollen ankle			0
but @entity117 is fit again and ready			0
‘ @entity117 trained yesterday ( thursday ) and looked good , ’ reported @entity19			1
‘ @entity118 is a bit too early			0
@entity115 will hopefully reach it , though he has still not trained			0
but he is very determined , so hopefully he will reach it			0
‘ we will give him until sunday because he is a very important player			2
we want him to play and i think he has a good chance			2
’ that @entity2 have the personnel is beyond doubt			1
there will be more focus at @entity126 on the discipline of the teams			0
@entity9 manager @entity129 poses with the @entity2 boss and the @entity0 at @entity126 so edgy and ill - tempered – and hugely enjoyable - was the @entity91 tie between these two teams at @entity133 last sunday that people are already looking for ‘ afters			1
’ evidence of bad blood which might lead to another day of big decisions and navel - gazing over the state of @entity4 refereeing			0
warning his team to keep their discipline , @entity19 recalled : ‘ it was the same against @entity145			1
if you lose your discipline there and get a red card you can lose the game			0
‘ i think we have been disciplined			0
last sunday some things happened after a situation			2
‘ again , when something happens like that you must keep discipline and focus			0
so i expect my players to do that in every game now			0
‘ we have to be disciplined			0
we have to think and we have to not do stupid things			0
stay on your feet and nothing will happen			0
‘ you have to have controlled aggression			0
@entity164 is always saying that			0
we have to be determined and high on motivation and aggression			0
‘ we have to be clear thinkers about what to do in certain situations			0
we want the team to be like that and we want to be the same way			0
’ chief executive @entity173 and @entity19 pictured after @entity2 announce new agreement with @entity175 he locked his players away in a form of exile at their @entity180 training ground before the @entity145 game and has employed similar tactics this week			1
nothing has been left to chance			0
the @entity185 gets a bad press			1
the crowds are poor , the interest levels low			0
the semi-finals were played on a @entity126 pitch better suited to @entity192 rice farmers , but a new surface has been laid for the final and @entity19 gave it the all - clear after a brief walkabout on thursday			1
the prospect of a new @entity2 manager going for his first trophy in charge sets a new narrative for sunday			1
nothing will be left to chance in pursuit of the prize			0
‘ all i do is go to @entity180 and then go home , ’ said @entity19			1
‘ you have to prepare for whatever is coming up , the next game all the time , and it has been a usual week for us			0
‘ we have big goals and one of them is to win trophies			2
the other is to develop the club in the direction i want it to go and they want it to go			0
‘ we have started well			0
the first year is always so hard wherever you go			0
you have to get people to understand what you believe in and you have to get to know people			0
if we can start by winning a trophy on sunday , it would be a very good start			2
