a behavioral checklist that the @entity1 uses to help identify airport travelers they believe could be potential terrorists has been revealed			2
the screening of @entity7 system , nicknamed spot , breaks down body language and demeanor the @entity1 believes indicates either ' stress ' or ' deception '			1
mannerisms are assigned points based on their severity and are assessed by trained ' @entity15 ' , who observe passengers as they go through the security checkpoint			1
behaviors are given points based on their perceived severity			1
if you walk through security with a ' face pale from recent shaving of beard ' or happen to be yawning or whistling , you can be assigned one point			1
having ' widely open eyes ' will get you two points , as will showing ' unusual ' interest in a security officer 's work routine or having ' identical luggage or dress ' to an individual who does not seem related to you			2
appearing to be in disguise will get you three points			0
but you can also get points shaved off			1
if you appear to be a member of a family or part of a married couple , you get two points deducted from your score			2
being a female over 55 , or a male over 65 , gets you a one point reduction			0
the checklist includes a list of items and behaviors to look out for if a passenger is pulled aside for inspection			0
' @entity68 ' items range from blueprints to liquids ' in excess of 3.4oz '			0
further signs of deception include excessive yawning or perspiration and lacking details about the purpose of one 's trip			2

@entity80 breaks down body language the @entity1 believes indicates ' stress ' or ' deception ' , including sweaty palms , a strong body odor , widely opened eyes or a bobbing @entity91 ( file photo ) the @entity83 found that there was no scientific evidence to support the spot 's claim that terrorists can be picked out via ' behavioral indicators ' , and said the human 's ability to ' accurately identify ' suspicious behavior is ' slightly better than chance '			1
the @entity82 report said that the @entity1 had not assessed the effectiveness of the @entity80 program or designed a ' comprehensive training program ' for it			1
it concluded that the @entity1 could not ' ensure that passengers at @entity108 airports are screened objectively ' with spot and did not believe the administration could ' justify the program 's expansion '			2
@entity1 was sued by the @entity112 last week for failing to respond to a @entity114 request regarding the spot program			0
the @entity112 is alleging that the program leads to racial profiling			0
a spokesperson with the @entity1 told the intercept that ' behavior detection ' was just ' one element ' of the administration 's efforts to ' mitigate threats against the traveling public '			0
' no single behavior alone will cause a traveler to be referred to additional screening or will result in a call or a law enforcement officer			0
' ' officers are trained and audited to ensure referrals for additional screening are based only on observable behaviors and not race or ethnicity ' .			0

the screening of passengers by @entity7 system breaks down body language the @entity1 believes indicates ' stress ' or ' deception '
