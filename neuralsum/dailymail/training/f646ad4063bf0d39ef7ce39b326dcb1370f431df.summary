bringing lots of presents , @entity65 they go , more agile than the reindeers , swinging to and fro			0
they are @entity32 's secret posties , bringing gifts wrapped in paper and ribbons , you thought the reindeers did this job , now you know it is the gibbons			0
mrs @entity77 said : ' because it was a poem about @entity7 , i made a list of festive words like snow and @entity32 and he would blink at the words he wanted to include			2
' we 'd gone through this process and had a whole load of christmassy words and then i asked ' are all the words you want to use on your list ? ' and he said ' no '			0
' baffled , she then started to point to letters on an alphabet chart and @entity40 carefully selected @entity95 followed by i. ' i thought the word must be " gift " but then he chose b and spelled out the word @entity54 , ' she added			0
' once he had all the words he needed he put them in order			0
it took him a week to write all the words for the poem			0
' this year his health has been really bad and he was in the @entity109 for respite care and they asked him to think about what he would like for his @entity113			0
' most of his friends wanted to go to @entity115 or meet a celebrity but @entity40 wanted to make his poem about the gibbons into a @entity7 song			1
' @entity40 , of @entity16 , was born with cerebral palsy and lost all movement at just 10 - months - old			1
when mrs @entity77 , who is studying for a phd in medical law , noticed that @entity40 would blink when she spoke to him she realised this was how he was trying to communicate			0
as he got older and learnt to read she began to hold up an alphabet chart , pointing to letters , with @entity40 blinking when she pointed to the correct one			0
the only movement @entity40 can make is to move his eyelids up and down in answer to questions			0
a blink means yes and if he simply stares it means no. the laborious process can mean it can often take a day to write just one sentence			0

when talented @entity40 won a poetry prize only a year later his mother suggested he wrote a festive poem to send out with the family 's @entity7 cards			1

' he 's really inspiring			0
despite all his difficulties , @entity40 was able to create something so wonderful			0

' it then took me about a week to record the track and i played all the instruments , including the piano and acoustic guitar , flute and bells			2
' animator @entity207 was then recruited to create a video cartoon to accompany the single which is being sold on @entity18 to raise money for @entity211 , a charity that runs children 's hospices in @entity188			1
