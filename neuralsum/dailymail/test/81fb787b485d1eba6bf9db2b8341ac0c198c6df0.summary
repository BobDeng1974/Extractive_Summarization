' @entity0 's horribly broken , ' @entity2 @entity1 sen. @entity1 said tuesday , but it came in the midst of a tv interview broken up by prickly moments and interruptions			1
@entity1 , who launched his presidential campaign tuesday in @entity8 , @entity2 , sparred with today host @entity9 about his past foreign policy positions			1
as @entity9 rattled off a list of issues where she said the senator had flipped and flopped – @entity14 , aid to @entity16 and defense spending – a testy and impatient @entity1 cut her off			1
' why do n't we let me explain instead of talking over me , ok ? ' he griped			1
@entity20 : newly minted @entity23 hopeful @entity1 and @entity22 host @entity9 talked over each other on wednesday @entity1 , a libertarian - leaning @entity2 senator , launched his presidential bid on tuesday in @entity8 ' no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no ! ' listen , you 've editorialized , ' @entity1 blasted at @entity9 ' before we go through a litany of things you say i 've changed on , why do n't you ask me a question : " have i changed my opinion ? " that would be sort of a better way to approach an interview			1
' @entity9 obliged , asking him if he had changed his views , but he charged ahead			0
' no , no , you 've editorialized , ' @entity1 said			0
' no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no ! ' listen , you 've editorialized			0
let me answer a question ! you ask a question , and you say , " have your views changed ? " instead of editorializing and saying my views have changed			0
' a spokesman for @entity45 , a liberal opposition - research group , leaped on @entity1 after the broadcast			2
' @entity1 ca n't seem to step in front of a camera without proving that shooting from the hip is a good way to shoot yourself in the foot , ' @entity47 told @entity53			2
' he 's got miles to go before his ability catches up to his ambition , ' @entity47 added			0
' and judging by his temper , he knows it , too			0
' when style gave way to substance on today , @entity1 clarified that when he said in 2007 that @entity14 was n't a threat to the @entity63 , the world was different and he was n't yet a candidate for the @entity65			1
' 2007 was a long time ago and events do change over long periods of time , ' he said			0
' so we 're talking about 8 years ago			0
we 're talking about a time when i was n't running for office and i was helping someone else run for office			2
' that ' someone else ' was his father , @entity74 , a former congressman who ran for president three times but never grabed the brass ring			0
the elder @entity1 was known for strictly non-interventionist views overseas in the face of growing threats abroad , a trap that his son has taken great pains to avoid			2
' there has always been a threat around gaining nuclear weapons and that 's greater now than it was many years ago , ' he said wednesday			0
his troublesome 2007 moment came during an interview with conspiracy - theorist radio host @entity93			2
' you know , it ’s ridiculous to think they ’re a threat to our national security , ' @entity1 said then of @entity14			1
' it ’s not even that viable to say they ’re a national threat to @entity16 , ' he added later			2
' most people say @entity16 has 100 nuclear weapons , you know			0
' on the today show , @entity1 the younger avoided taking a stand on the nuclear agreement the @entity23 says it has carved out with @entity110 's mullahs			1
@entity1 was joined by his wife @entity111 on stage tuesday as he declared that he would campaign to ' take our country back ' ' i 'm going to keep an open mind and look at the agreement , ' @entity1 said , while allowing that ' i do believe that negotiation is better than war			1
' he mirrored other republicans in questioning the ' sincerity of the @entity14 ' in reaching an agreement with the @entity63 and five @entity124 nations			1
' if they 're immediately saying that the agreement does n't mean what president @entity127 says , that is a big problem , ' @entity1 said			2
' the @entity14 put out 500 words , the @entity63 put out 1,300 words , the @entity124 put out 200 words			1
and they do n't all seem to agree , but it 's very , very little information so far			0
' he defended his position on foreign aid , saying that even @entity16 prime minister @entity136 has agreed that his country should one day shake off its dependence on @entity63 to fund its defense program			1
' i still agree with my original precept , which is – lem me answer the question ! – i still agree with my original statement from years ago that ultimately all nations should be free of foreign aid , ' he said , ' because we should n't borrow money to do it			1
' ' but my opinion 's not any different than @entity136 's opinion			0
' the @entity1 campaign did not respond to a request for comment no whether or not @entity9 gave him a fair interview .			0

@entity1 is already under fire for his *evolving* views on @entity14 , foreign aid to @entity16 and defense spending
why do n't we let me explain instead of talking over me , ok ? ' he asked the ' today ' host as she tried to *corner* him
@entity1 launched his presidential quest on tuesday in @entity2 andis already on a five - state campaign swing
he pinned his 2007 claim that @entity14 was not a threat to the @entity63 on the fact that he was campaigning for his father 's presidential bid at the time
