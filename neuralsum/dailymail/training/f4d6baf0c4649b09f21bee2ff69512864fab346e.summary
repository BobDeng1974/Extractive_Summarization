by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 has confirmed he and team - mate @entity3 are pulling in the same direction in a bid to haul @entity6 back to the front of the @entity9 grid			1
the return of @entity3 to @entity6 , pitching two world champions together in the same team , was expected to produce fireworks and results			2
but there has been nothing sparkly about their relationship to date as the @entity19 has struggled for form , leaving @entity2 to keep @entity6 in the hunt for podiums			1
not working : @entity3 ( left ) has been poor this season , placing a big burden on @entity2 ( right ) taking instructions : the pair receive a briefing before the @entity28 @entity2 and @entity3 did at least conjure their best results this season last time out in @entity32 before the sport 's summer break , finishing second and sixth			1
circumstances , however , dictated the result , which was no indicator as to a potential revival for the second half of the campaign which starts on sunday with the @entity40 @entity28			1
@entity2 and @entity3 both know they have a lot of work to do if @entity6 are to show signs over the closing eight races they can again be a force to be reckoned with in 2015			1
to that end , the duo are working hand in hand and @entity2 said : ' we definitely work a lot together			0
plenty to ponder : @entity2 has seen @entity6 struggle this season , with team - mate @entity3 out of form ' the meetings have been quite long this year because we have had a lot of things to sort out after the races			1
' we have been constantly making suggestions and comments about what we have on the track to try to help the engineers to transfer that to @entity69 ( factory ) and to translate those comments into ideas for the car			0
' it 's not a big change compared to the way i used to work with @entity78 ( @entity79 ) and any other team - mate			0
' it 's a working relationship to try to help the team all the time			2
' happier times : @entity3 ( left ) and @entity2 ( centre ) celebrate a podium finish in the 2013 @entity87 @entity28 @entity2 has so far finished ahead of @entity3 in all 11 races , and although he can point to longevity with the team as one reason behind such a statistic , the new regulations introduced at the start of the campaign should have provided more of a level playing field			1
@entity3 , though , has not found the car to his liking at all , with @entity2 adding : ' obviously the car is not great			2
' we lack downforce and traction , and we had difficulties with braking at the first couple of races , and other systems , that we had new this year			0
' @entity3 was probably not feeling confident with the car and he was not totally happy with the balance , but at the moment neither of us are super happy with the performance			0
' all we can do is to try to keep improving to score more points because , up until the last race and especially with the constructors ' championship , we were going backwards a little bit			0
' we now need to put both cars in the points as many times as possible			0
' respect : @entity2 has seen @entity120 surge to second position in this year 's championship			0

@entity2 : ' it 's a working relationship to try to help the team '
@entity3 returned to @entity6 for the 2014 season but has struggled
@entity2 has fared better , recording two podium finishes
@entity2 has so far finished ahead of @entity3 in all 11 races this year
the @entity40 @entity28 begins on sunday
