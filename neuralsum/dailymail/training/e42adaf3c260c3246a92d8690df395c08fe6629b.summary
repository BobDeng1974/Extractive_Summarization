by @entity1 reporter @entity3 's parents tried everything to help their deaf 3 - year - old son hear			1
but when a cochlear implant failed to fix his auditory disability , @entity8 and @entity9 turned to an untested method that had never before been used on children in the @entity12 : an ' auditory brain stem implant			1
' after the chip was implanted , @entity3 - who was adopted by the clamps as a newborn after he was placed in foster care - could hear for the first time in his life			2
' we do n't know exactly what he hears			0
his brain is still trying organize itself to use sound			2
' @entity3 is missing the cochlear nerves in his ears that allow humans to process the sounds that we hear			1
after the cochlear implant failed , the @entity40 decided to participate in a research trial at @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45 , where doctors were researching the use of the implant on children			0
auditory brain stem implants have been used on adults in the @entity12 since 1979			1
but researchers have never before tested the device on children - although , it is approved for use on children in @entity56			0
the procedure requires doctors to implant a microchip into a patient 's brain			2
the microchip then helps him recognize and process sound			0
medical breakthrough : clamp was the first child in the @entity12 to receive an auditory brain stem implant surgery : to implant the device that now allows him to hear , @entity3 had to undergo brain surgery the technology is similar to that of a cochlear implant - using electrical stimulation - the brain stem implant uses electrical impulses to stimulate the brain , rather than the cochlea			1
to date , roughly 1,000 people have undergone the procedure , with varying degrees of success - most recipients of the implant only have an awareness of sound			1
it 's described as being able to hear the beat , but not the melody			0
for @entity3 , the device seems to be working - his parents say his face lit up when he heard his father 's voice for the first time about three weeks ago			2
' it 's been phenomenal for us , ' @entity96 says			0
a good home : clamp was adopted as a newborn after his parents found him in foster care			0

@entity3 is the first child in the @entity12 to have an auditory brain stem implant
about 1,000 people in the world have auditory brain stem implants
auditory brain stem implants were first used in humans in 1979
