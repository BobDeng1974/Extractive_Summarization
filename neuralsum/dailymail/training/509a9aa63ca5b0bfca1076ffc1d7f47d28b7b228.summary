according to the inspector general , that task force can obtain @entity2 confidential passenger reservation information at no cost			2
@entity2 is not a federal agency but it runs its own police force -- which already partners with the @entity0 and shares information like passenger lists and cargo manifests the office of @entity2 inspector general @entity27 declined to identify the secretary or say why it took so long to uncover the payments			1
@entity27 's report on the incident suggested policy changes and ' other measures to address control weaknesses that @entity2 management is considering			2
' @entity0 spokeswoman @entity37 declined to comment			0

@entity2 's inspector general said the secretary provided the passenger information without seeking approval from @entity2 management or police , but @entity2 's own corporate privacy policy expressly allows it to sell or share personal information about its customers and passengers with contractors or a category of others it describes as ' certain trustworthy business partners			1

@entity0 administrator @entity92 will face pressure after the revelation that her agency paid an @entity2 secretary $ 854,460 over nearly 20 years to obtain confidential information about train passengers @entity100 @entity99 sen. @entity99 said the hundreds of thousands of dollars in payouts were unnecessary , and demanded more information from the @entity0 the report said the secretary was allowed to retire , rather than face administrative discipline , after the discovery that the employee had ' regularly ' sold private passenger information since 1995 without @entity2 's approval , said the @entity111 's summary			1
sen. @entity99 , the senior @entity99 on the @entity113 , called the $ 854,460 an unnecessary expense and asked for further information about the incident in a letter he released monday to @entity0 administrator @entity92			1

' it 's not unprecedented for law enforcement to have professional people who are informants employed in transportation and other industries , said a federal law enforcement official who is familiar with the incident involving @entity2			0
the official spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak on the record			0

the @entity2 secretary who pocketed the @entity0 's cloak - and - *dagger* money was allowed to retire instead of facing dismissal or other discipline
