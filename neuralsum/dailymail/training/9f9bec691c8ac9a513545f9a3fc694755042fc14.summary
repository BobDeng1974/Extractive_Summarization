when @entity1 damaged his car driving over a pothole , he decided that the council should foot the repair bill			1
but rather than admit fault , officials said they knew nothing of the hole and said his poor driving must have been to blame			1
they dismissed the 62 - year - old grandfather ’s claim that they should pay the £ 500 bill to fix the wrecked suspension on his @entity16			1
pothole : @entity1 , 62 , stands over the pothole in @entity19 , which damaged the suspension on his car but mr @entity1 suspected he was being fobbed off and resolved to find out whether the council was telling him the truth			1
using a @entity24 request , he found out that a council worker had reported the 18in by 6in hole during an inspection three months earlier – but the council had ignored it			1
the hole was even recorded as a priority case that should be repaired within 28 days , but it was never fixed			2
he thought that this evidence should be enough to force the council to soften its stance			2
but even after mr @entity1 , a retired @entity37 project manager , told @entity38 of his findings , it still refused to pay up – and the disagreement went to the small claims court			1
at a hearing at @entity44 , a judge ruled in favour of mr @entity1 and ordered the council to refund him £ 500 , plus costs of £ 115			1
victory : mr @entity1 , pictured , won a £ 500 payout from @entity38 after a judge ruled in his favour mr @entity1 , who has been nicknamed ‘ mr pothole ’ by his friends , last night told the @entity54 he hopes his win will inspire other drivers to make claims			1
his ordeal began when he struck the unfilled hole around a mile from his home in @entity19 one rainy night last april			1
‘ i think the council works on the basis that a lot of drivers will just throw their hands up in despair at all the obstacles which are put in their way and just forget about it as people just do n’t want the hassle , ’ he said			0
‘ i have had phone calls and texts saying “ well done ” since i won the court case and hopefully more people will now do the same			0
’ he said the council had claimed the road was in a ‘ reasonable condition – but i knew different and anybody who had driven on the road knew the truth ’			1
mr @entity1 , who is married to @entity83 , 62 and has three grown - up children , said he would now try to find out how much money the council spent fighting the case instead of just paying up			1
‘ on the night it happened , it was pitch black and it was raining so the potholes were full of water – i did not have a chance			0
i heard the bang and realised there might be a problem as the car was not right , ’ he said			0
‘ my garage gave me the bad news that i had a broken suspension arm so it was a major repair job			1
‘ had it been a cyclist or motorcyclist who went down into that pothole , they could have been killed			0
’ an @entity38 spokesman said : ‘ we felt we had a valid statutory defence to the claim , but the court disagreed and found for the claimant			2
’ in november last year , the council faced embarrassment after the councillor responsible for highways admitted he himself had applied for compensation three years earlier from the authority after his car hit a pothole			2
@entity121 , who took up his role in may last year , paid £ 250 for repairs after the exhaust clamp broke off his @entity126 convertible , but his claim for compensation was rejected			0
there are currently thought to be around 200,000 potholes in need of attention across @entity134 roads but the recent severe wet weather and freezing conditions are expected to make the problem worse			0
insurance company @entity138 this week estimated that the annual repair bill for damage caused by potholes has increased by 150 per cent in the past three years to £ 730million			0
damage : mr @entity121 had damaged his @entity126 , similar to the one pictured @entity38 ’s highways chief applied for compensation from his own authority after his @entity126 convertible hit a pothole - and was refused			1
@entity121 , 67 , who took over responsibility for highways in may last year , asked the authority for compensation three years ago when the exhaust clamp broke off his @entity126 convertible			2
he said : ' i submitted a claim to @entity38 , but it was rebutted			2
' i can empathise with those who do damage their cars , it is very irritating , but it is something we have to live with			0
' these things happen and you have to grin and bear it			0
' we have to have our eyes open all the time when we are driving			0
' mr @entity121 has since replaced the car , and said he does not interfere with the claims procedure as a cabinet member for highways			2
rules state if a road defect has been drawn to the council ’s attention , is classed as severe and has not been repaired , a claim for compensation can be made for any damage caused			1
in mr @entity121 ’s case , the problem had not been reported to @entity176			0
he said last november : ' the council ’s claims record is very good , or very bad if you are a driver			0
our ability to defend claims is very good , and this means we are actually inspecting and taking remedial action on severe potholes quickly			0
' if someone has damaged their vehicle they will know if we have inspected the defect and how serious it is by whether it has orange paint , which is a priority and should be dealt with within 28 days , or purple paint , which means it is less serious			0

@entity1 , 62 , said hole in @entity19 road broke @entity16 **'s** suspension
when @entity38 denied responsibility , he turned *detective*
mr @entity1 used @entity24 *law* to prove council was to blame
@entity38 must now pay for mr @entity1 **'s** car repair and costs
mr @entity1 said : ' i am a man of principles - the council made a mistake '
