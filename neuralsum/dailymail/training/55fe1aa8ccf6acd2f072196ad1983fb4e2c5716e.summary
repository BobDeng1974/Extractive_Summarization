@entity20 ( with her parents @entity17 and @entity18 and younger brother @entity19 ) , has a rare condition which means she 's the size of a two - year old and weighs less than two stone			1
her younger brother is already taller than her tiny : @entity4 's condition means she wears clothes designed for a two - year - old and excels at hide and seek the body is smaller than it should be even before birth and those affected also find it difficult to gain weight			1
but despite being smaller than her school friends and her younger brother , @entity19 , 4 , @entity4 can walk , play and boss them around like any other six year old			1
last week , her parents , @entity37 , 30 and @entity38 , 31 , watched her take to the stage in the school nativity			0
her mother said : ' watching her we were so proud , but it did make us realise how big the other children were compared to @entity4			1
' she was all smiles in the nativity and singing along to all the songs			0
she lit up the room and kept waving to us begging to have more pictures taken			0
to us , she 's our little @entity53 angel			0
' although @entity4 's mental capacity is the same as any other six - year - old , she 's well below the average weight and height for her age group			1
ms @entity37 added ; ' when @entity4 was born we knew something was wrong			2
i was terrified when she had to be induced at 36 weeks			0
small : @entity4 ( left ) aged eight weeks next to a four - week - old baby ( right )			1
she suffers from a rare genetic condition called @entity65 syndrome ' she weighed just 3lb 5oz and the doctors did n't have a clue why she was so small			2
' i took her home , but she did n't gain any weight when i fed her - she was too weak to suckle properly			1
the doctors told us she was a small baby but she 'd catch up eventually			0
' as a toddler , @entity4 's head grew so much bigger than her body that she was n't even able to lift it as she crawled along the living room carpet			1
ms @entity37 and her partner @entity18 , a retail manager at a mobile phone shop , spent the next three years visiting geneticists and dietitians , desperate to know why their little girl was n't developing normally			0
at the age of three , a referral to the genetics team at @entity84 finally brought a diagnosis - @entity12			1
@entity12 is a form of primordial dwarfism			1
it means that the body is smaller than it should be even before birth and those affected find it difficult to gain weight ms @entity37 said : ' we were terrified			1
@entity4 only weighed 11lbs and it was scary watching her go through so many tests			2
when they finally said that she 'd tested positive for @entity12 we were so relieved - we could finally help her			1
' ' with her blonde hair , cheeky smile and gorgeous blue eyes , @entity4 loves doing the same things as any other schoolgirl			2
' she has little steps to help with washing her hands and at home loves nothing more than dressing up like a princess or writing mummy and daddy notes saying " i love you "			0
despite being two years younger , @entity4 's brother @entity19 is taller she added : ' we still worry about the impact @entity12 will have on @entity4 's life - but she 's so confident and cheeky			1
she does get upset when people mention her size but now she 's old enough to tell them off which is quite funny			0
' unfortunately , passers - by and other children do comment on @entity4 's pint - sized form - and it 's not always positive			1
' in the supermarket , people used to gather around our trolley and gawp , ' says ms @entity37			0
' they 'd ask " what 's wrong with her ? " ' then when @entity4 could walk they 'd tell me off and say " your baby should n't be walking "			2
' ' everyone at @entity4 's school is so understanding , but sometimes we 'll go to play areas and other children will call her a baby and tell her off for playing in there			2
' but her younger brother @entity19 is already standing up for his older sister			0
at 103cms , he already towers over her and their height difference makes playing games even more fun			0
their mother said : ' @entity4 does get confused and asks why @entity19 is taller , but he 's so protective of his sister and he 'll always stick up for her			2
' she usually wins at hide and seek because she can fit into a little cupboard in the bedroom where he ca n't find her			0
' despite her specially adapted steps to reach things at school , @entity4 has had very few problems			2
because of her tiny fingers , she used to find fastening buttons difficult - but can now put her school uniform on herself.now she puts on her school uniform all by herself			1
tough : despite being dwarfed by her school friends and her younger brother , @entity19 , 4 , @entity4 can walk , play and boss them around like any other six year old , says her mother @entity17 ms @entity37 added : ' when she first started school she kept getting knocked over because people would run past and not see her			2
but she has a ' school buddy ' to look after her on the playground and the kids are brilliant			0
' @entity4 is being treated with growth hormones to give her a bit more height and has recently had hearing aids fitted			2
she also finds walking long distances difficult and has a special purple wheelchair to help her along			0
common physical traits of those affected include a small , triangular - shaped face and a head which grows to be disproportionate to the rest of the body			1
her mother said : ' there are adults with @entity12 who have led normal lives and had children of their own			2
we have to be positive for @entity4 's sake			0
when we look back at what she 's achieved it 's just incredible			0
' @entity12 is a growth disorder that causes slow growth both before and after birth			1
babies with the condition tend to have a low birth weight and often fail to grow and gain weight			1
however , their heads grow at a normal rate meaning they often appear unusually large compared to the rest of the body			0

the average height for a man with the condition is 4ft 11in and for a woman , 4ft 7ins			0
