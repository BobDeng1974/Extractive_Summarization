by @entity0 published : 03:32 est , 11 november 2013 updated : 01:42 est , 12 november 2013 @entity2 set up fake pages imitating @entity4 and other websites in order to spy on communications firms , it has been claimed			1
leaked documents apparently reveal that the @entity10 surveillance service targeted security staff responsible for safeguarding networks across @entity13			1
the claim is likely to lead to further controversy among @entity10 's allies coming just a week after it was reported that the @entity10 was spying on @entity18 via its embassy in @entity20			1
claims : spies at @entity2 , whose headquarters are pictured , are alleged to have hacked into telecoms firms @entity18 magazine @entity25 reported that one tactic used by @entity2 to monitor mobile phone and internet traffic was to install ' malware ' via dummy copies of popular websites			1
@entity10 spies apparently found out which employees of @entity35 's state - owned telecoms firm @entity34 used business network @entity4 and other sites , including tech news forum @entity38			1
they then created copies of @entity4 pages which were indistinguishable from the originals but which secretly installed software on the users ' computers , the magazine reported			1
this malware , installed by a process known as ' @entity48 ' , allegedly gave @entity2 access to the company 's routers			1
communications networks are particularly valuable to spies , because they allow instant access to individual users			2
defence : the agency 's director @entity57 insists its work is essential to national security other companies prioritised by @entity2 , according to @entity25 , were companies which process billing payments between mobile phone companies in different countries			0
spies are alleged to have hacked in to the computers of engineers at @entity68 and @entity69 , both largely unknown to the general public but key to international communications networks			2
by infiltrating telecoms companies , @entity10 is apparently able to compile detailed portraits of suspects ' lives			1
leaks : the latest allegations came from documents obtained by contractor @entity80 in one case , @entity25 reported , the firm drew up a list of multiple computers used by an employee of @entity69 , as well as his @entity87 , @entity88 and social networking accounts			0
the latest hacking allegations were brought to light in secret documents leaked by former @entity93 government contractor @entity80			0
they are believed to centre around a @entity2 department called ' @entity96 ' , or @entity97 , which brings together key staff from different divisions to work on infiltrating international telecommunications			2
one leaked document shows prince @entity102 and the @entity103 visiting @entity97 for a briefing on @entity105			0
a @entity4 spokesman told @entity25 : ' we were never told about this alleged activity and we would never approve of it , irrespective of what purpose it was used for			2
' the spying claims have prompted a furious reaction within @entity35 , where public prosecutors have launched an investigation			0
last week , the @entity10 ambassador to @entity18 was summoned to meet government officials over allegations that @entity2 had installed a ' listening post ' on top of the @entity10 embassy			2
and over the weekend an @entity123 politician claimed that the @entity10 spied on officials who were negotiating over the collapse of the country 's banks			1
@entity2 's head , @entity57 , delivered a robust defence of the agency 's work when he appeared in front of mps at a select committee hearing last week			0
the agency has refused to comment on the latest allegations			0
@entity80 , a former contractor at @entity93 's @entity137 , has rocked the intelligence world by leaking secret documents which reveal the previously unknown extent of global spying			0
while most of his revelations involved the @entity137 , he has also made a number of disclosures about @entity2 , which shares intelligence with the @entity93 and other close allies			0
it emerged that @entity10 spies regularly tap in to the fibre - optic cables which carry internet traffic around the world , co-operating with telecoms firms to intercept data			1
the programme , known as ' @entity155 ' , is meant to target terror suspects but also collects information about millions of innocent people			0
documents passed to newspapers by mr @entity80 showed @entity2 also monitors emails sent using popular services such as @entity88 , @entity163 and @entity164			0
a diplomatic outcry ensued when it emerged that @entity10 had spied on the leaders of other governments during the @entity169 summit in @entity170 in 2009			1
and last week the @entity18 government - already furious that the @entity93 had been tapping the phone of chancellor @entity174 - summoned the @entity10 ambassador for a meeting over claims that the @entity10 embassy was used for spying by @entity2 .			0
