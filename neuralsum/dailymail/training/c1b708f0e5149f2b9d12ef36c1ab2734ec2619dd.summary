thanks to well - endowed stars such as @entity3 and @entity4 , curvaceous derrieres have never been more popular			2
but as mother - of - two @entity5 knows only too well , attempting to get the look using silicone filler can have catastrophic results			1
instead of a curvier behind , mrs @entity5 was left in agony and eventually had to have her buttocks , legs and arms amputated after a black market practitioner injected her with industrial grade silicone of the sort commonly used in bathroom sealant			1
her problems began in 2005 when a woman claiming she could provide buttock injections walked into her salon			2
instead of telling her to leave , @entity5 , who says she always wanted bigger buttocks , was thrilled and immediately agreed to have the treatment			1
at first , everything seemed fine but just months after having the injections , the pain began			2
' they [ @entity5 's buttocks ] started to get hard , and then they started to get discoloured , ' she explains			1
' by 2006 , it was starting to itch and by 2007 , the pain started			2
' one thing about pain is that you ca n't turn it off			2
i could n't sleep , i could n't eat , i could n't even concentrate			2
' upsetting : @entity5 says she hopes others will learn from her harrowing experience of cowboy surgery but things continued to get worse			1
'' i had gone to this party one saturday night and woke up sunday morning and thought " oh my @entity52 , @entity53 ! "			2
i just could n't pull myself together , ' she remembers			2
' that night was the roughest night of my life			0
i literally scratched all of the skin off my buttocks			0
my nails pulled all of the skin off my body			0
and when my sister came in , and she saw that , it freaked her out			0
' @entity5 was rushed to hospital , where surgeons discovered that a massive infection caused by the impure silicone had caused her body to go into severe shock			1
' the only end point on silicone injections is removal , ' explains the doctor who saved @entity5 's life , @entity75			1
' removal when it 's not infected or removal when it is infected and about to kill you			0
' after a month in a coma , @entity5 awoke to a very different world			1
the drugs that saved @entity5 's life had diverted blood flow to her essential organs , keeping her heart beating and liver functioning as her body fought off the infection			1
but her hands and feet , starved of oxygen while the drugs did their work , had died			0
' i just moved the cover and i saw my right foot and i thought " oh my @entity52 " and it was that moment , that 's when it got real , ' remembers @entity5			1
gruesome : the damage to @entity5 's backside following the botched jab			1
her buttocks were later amputated dangerous : silicone injections nearly always have terrible side effects , say leading surgeons ' they were just black and swollen and necrotic and there was gangrene , and one [ of @entity53 's family members ] said : " just look at your hands " and i looked and that 's when it got really real			1
along with her buttocks , too damaged and infected from the injections to remain , her hands and feet had to be amputated			1
despite the heavy price she paid for cheap surgery , @entity5 says that she 's recovering and is determined to enjoy the rest of her life			1
' now it 's just my new normal , ' she explains			0
' now it 's just different			0
now i do n't just wake up and jump up on my legs , i wake up and snap on my prosthetics			1
' the hands , that 's more challenging because you do n't really realise how much you do with them until you do n't have them			0
' leading surgeon , dr @entity131 of the @entity132 , commented : ' we strongly discourage our patients from undergoing buttock injections			0
' you will not find any professional @entity138 cosmetic surgeon that would be prepared to perform this procedure			0
' she also hopes others will learn from her story and offers this advice to those contemplating surgery : ' do n't ever do anything without researching it and definitely do n't ever do anything on the black market			0
' it 's not about how you fall down			0
it 's not about making choices that are not catastrophic			0
it 's about knowing how to get up			0
' and the only thing that will ever make you feel better about yourself is feeling loved			0
that you are enough , no matter how it looks , what it is or how it feels , that it 's enough			0
' @entity5 appears in @entity161 , tonight on @entity162 at 10pm			1
