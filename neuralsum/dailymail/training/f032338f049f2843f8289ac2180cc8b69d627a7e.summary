by @entity0 last updated at 8:47 am on 2nd february 2012 immigrants are to be banned from taking the driving test in their native language amid mounting evidence that rogue translators are helping them cheat their way to a licence			1
government sources last night said that it would ditch the rules ‘ within months ’ that let learners sit the theory test in any of 19 foreign languages – including @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 – and ban translators who can currently sit in on the practical test to explain the examiner ’s instructions			2
nearly 800 people have had licences revoked in the past two years , after investigations by the @entity25 uncovered evidence of rogue translators coaching learners during their test			1
change : tests must now be carried out in @entity31 or @entity32 after investigations uncovered rogue translators there are dozens more cases in the pipeline and nine translators have been struck off the approved list			2
a @entity40 source said each investigation costs an average of £ 10,000 – and warned that the cases uncovered so far may be just the ‘ tip of the iceberg ’			2
ministers are also concerned about the safety implications of handing driving licences to thousands of people who do not speak @entity31 and can not read road signs			1
in 2010 , some 93,407 driving theory tests were sat in a foreign language			0
more than 1,500 people also took the theory test for a bus driver ’s licence in a foreign language			1
transport minister @entity57 said the existing rules also acted as a disincentive for immigrants to learn @entity31 transport minister @entity57 said the existing rules , which were introduced by the last @entity62 , also acted as a disincentive for immigrants to learn @entity31			0
he said : ‘ this practice is wrong on many levels , and we are going to end it			0
it is very hard to fathom the logic of why it was ever allowed in the first place			0
road safety should be our priority , not political correctness			0
‘ it can not be right to be handing @entity78 driving licences to people who are unable to read warning signs flashed up on motorway gantries			1
there is also evidence of fraud			1
‘ but there is also a wider point about community cohesion – we should be encouraging people to learn @entity31 , instead of offering them ways to avoid it			2
’ government sources said the change , which could be brought in by the autumn , did not require a change in the law			0
in future , drivers will be able to take their test in only @entity31 or @entity32			0
however , the @entity99 has privately warned ministers that the ban may breach anti-discrimination laws unless the government can produce firm evidence that allowing people to take the driving test in a foreign language is a threat to road safety			1
but mr @entity57 said he was confident that there was ‘ just cause ’ for the ban , and pointed out that most other @entity112 countries do not allow learners to take their driving test in a foreign language .			0
