@entity1 counter-terrorism experts have identified 64 suburbs in dozens of cities that act as breeding grounds for @entity7 extremism			1
so - called ' ghettos ' with high rates of youth unemployment , immigration and single - parent families , such as @entity13 near @entity14 , have been linked to the radicalisation of young and vulnerable people			1
@entity1 prime minister @entity17 last month admitted that the country had collapsed into social and ethnic ' apartheid ' - the first time a senior politician has conceded that economic marginalisation and religious tensions have led to serious divides			1
until 17 people were killed in january 's shocking @entity27 terror attacks , the @entity1 government remained largely consistent in its claim that overriding ' @entity29 ' was a unifying factor more powerful than loyalties to local communities or religious belief			2
tragic : until 17 people were killed in january 's shocking @entity27 terror attacks , the @entity1 government remained largely consistent in its claim that overriding ' frenchness ' was a unifying factor in the country extremists : @entity37 ( left ) and @entity38 ( right ) , who killed 12 people in an attack on the @entity27 magazine offices in central @entity42			1
the pair then died following a siege in total 64 @entity1 suburbs have been identified as breeding grounds for extremism , each of them sharing startling similar characteristics , according to @entity50			1
unemployment , for example , is on average 23 per cent in the suburbs , rising to a staggering 45 per cent among the young			1
up to half of all families in the 64 suburbs also have just one parent			1
for those lucky enough to have work , the average income is just € 11,000 ( £ 8,300 ) a year , leaving many with barely enough money to survive			1
as many as 50 per cent of those living in the suburbs are also first generation immigrants or their children , many of them having travelled to @entity1 from war - torn nations			1
such patterns of have now proved to the @entity1 leadership that vast swathes of the population are falling behind economically , resulting in ghettoised suburbs where mental and social attachment to @entity1 as a nation holds little sway , and where criminal and religious leaders often wield power			2
militants : the @entity1 government believes that around 400 @entity1 citizens have travelled to @entity82 and @entity83 to fight alongside militants from the @entity86 terror group ( pictured ) claim : @entity1 prime minister @entity17 ( pictured ) last month admitted that the country had collapsed into social and ethnic ' apartheid ' as well as identifying 64 suburbs as having the potential to push the young and vulnerable towards extremism , the @entity1 interior ministry has also designated 15 @entity93 in areas already considered hotbeds of crime - with radical @entity97 and jihadism chief among them			1
speaking to @entity50 , colonel @entity100 , head of the @entity101 in @entity102 , said : ' there is a very blurred and small gap between organised crime and terrorism			0
' ' terrorists need funding and they are often recruited in prisons			0
if you 're a terrorist and a former criminal you know where and how to get weapons , ' he added			0
he added that weapons , including guns , are easy to come by in these 15 areas , as each of them extensive links to mafia smuggling routes from @entity123 and eastern @entity124			0
the 15 areas , which have not been identified , have already been reinforced by undercover investigators and uniformed officers , with rapid response road blocks and random weapon and drugs checks now in force in an effort to reduce the rate of criminality			0
tribute : millions marched through @entity42 in the days that followed the attack as they showed their support for freedom of speech and the @entity27 staff @entity141 : the satirical magazine @entity27 was targeted by @entity7 terrorists because of it frequently published cartoons about the religion			0
17 people died over three bloody days last month the @entity1 government has been ridiculed for producing a poster to help identify potential jihadists - with one suggestion that giving up baguettes is a telltale sign			1
they claim pointers that someone is being radicalised by @entity97 fanatics include alarm bells such as losing interest in sports , rejecting family members and changing eating habits			0
the poster was launched as part of a new £ 320million campaign to counter terrorism in the wake of the @entity27 attacks			0
but the attempt to inform the public backfired , with many ridiculing the @entity172 poster for the suggestions it made			0
news of the terrorism breeding grounds being identified comes as @entity1 police arrested eight men suspected of recruiting fighters for @entity97 militants in @entity82			2
the arrests in the @entity42 and @entity184 areas are not linked to the @entity27 attacks , interior minister @entity181 told local media			0
the @entity1 government believes that around 400 @entity1 citizens have travelled to @entity82 and @entity83 to fight alongside militants from the @entity86 terror group			2
there are also approximately 900 @entity7 extremists still in @entity1 with links to recruitment cells			2
mr @entity181 said 161 terror - related legal proceedings were in progress , with 547 individuals suspected of involvement in terror networks			0
the majority of these relate to the funding and recruitment for terrorist groups , rather than the plotting of terror attacks themselves .			0
