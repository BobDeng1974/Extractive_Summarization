by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 07:08 est , 29 december 2013 @entity3 : 08:39 est , 29 december 2013 allergic to everything from dust to grass and even clothes , life for @entity10 , 17 , is n't always easy			1
the teenager , from @entity12 , spends her days swathed in bandages thanks to the painful eczema , dermatitis , arthritis and asthma caused by her multiple allergies			1
and her condition is often made worse by coming into contact with items that most of us handle each day , including cleaning products , strong light and even heat from the radiator			1
trapped : @entity10 , 17 , is virtually a prisoner in her own home because of her rare condition as a result , the teenager is virtually a prisoner in her own home as exposure to the outside world leaves her with blistered skin and painful rashes			1
' i have to apply cream two or three times a day and i wear bandages every night to keep the cream on my skin , ' explains @entity10			1
' i also have to have a bath at least twice a day			2
if i do n't my skin cracks and dries out			2
' but that 's not all			2
eating is also a minefield for the teenager , who has to follow a severely limited diet in order to avoid dangerous reactions			2
' i have to avoid certain foods such as diary products , wheat , soya , nuts and oats , ' she explains			2
' if i eat them my throat starts to swell up and close			0
i also take ten tablets a day			0
' thanks to her allergies , @entity10 , who has three sisters and three brothers , is unable to lead a normal life and will never be able to wear make - up or get a tattoo or piercing			1
painful : thanks to her condition , @entity10 spends her life swathed in bandages and suffers agonising blisters difficult : because of her allergies , @entity10 is unable to lead a normal teenage life but says she 's happy lifelong : @entity10 has had the condition all her life and is now hoping to make a career helping children and despite living on the edge of some of the @entity82 's most spectacular countryside , @entity10 is forced to give local farms a wide berth because she is allergic to all animals , while pollen makes her ill. ' i have always wanted to go to a farm but i know if i go i will react badly , ' added @entity10			1
' the nutrients from my skin are gone and my immune system is broken , so while other peoples bodies fight off colds in a couple of days mine takes a couple of weeks			0
' my brothers and sisters all help me			0
if we go out for a meal they always enquire about the ingredients and we avoid going anywhere where there is pollen			1
' they often say they wish they could be in my shoes for a day so they can understand what it was like			0
' but despite the pain and the lack of a cure for her rare condition , the brave 17 - year - old insists that she would n't want to live any other way			1
she left school with excellent gcse 's and is now studying childcare at @entity123 in the hope of working with children with special needs			0
' i grew up wearing bandages constantly so i do n't know any different , ' she explained			0
' people say to me if there was a cure would i take it but i do n't think i would			0
' although it is hard sometimes , i like being different to everyone else			0
i would n't have it any other way			0
