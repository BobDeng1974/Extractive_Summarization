by @entity0 published : 09:51 est , 27 december 2012 updated : 19:46 est , 30 december 2012 end of an era : @entity3 's life takes a wild turn in the pages of amazing spider - man no. 700 after 50 years of spinning webs and catching a who 's who of criminals , @entity3 is out of the hero game			1
but @entity3 is still slinging from building to building - reborn , refreshed and revived with a new sense of the old maxim that @entity13 taught his then - fledgling nephew that ' with great power , comes great responsibility			1
' writer @entity17 , who 's been penning @entity3 adventures for the better part of the last 100 issues for @entity21 , said the culmination of the story is a new , dramatically different direction for the hero that @entity26 and @entity27 created in 1962			1
' this is an epic turn , ' @entity17 said			0
' i 've been writing @entity3 for 70 - plus issues			1
every now and then , you have to shake it up ... the reason @entity3 is one of the longest running characters is they always find a way to keep it fresh			2
something to shake up the mix. ' and in the pages of issue 700 , which came out yesterday , it 's not just shaken up , it 's turned head over heels , spun in circles , kicked sky high and cracked wide open			0
@entity3 's mind is trapped in the withered , decaying dying body of his nemesis , @entity48 aka @entity48			1
where 's @entity48 ? inside @entity3 's super-powered shell , learning what life is like for the brilliant researcher who happens to count the @entity53 and @entity54 as friends and family			1
the two clash mightily in the pages of issue 700 , illustrated by @entity60 and @entity61			0
but it 's @entity48 who wins out and @entity3 is , at least for now , gone for good , but not before one more act of heroism			1
@entity17 said that it 's @entity3 , whose memories envelop @entity48 , who shows the villain what it means to be a hero			1
twist : in amazing spider - man no. 700 , @entity3 's mind is trapped in the withered , decaying dying body of his nemesis , @entity48 aka @entity48 ' gone are his days of villainy , but since it 's @entity48 and he has that ego , he 's not going to try and just be spider - man , he 's going to try to be the best @entity3 ever , ' said @entity17			1
editor @entity81 said that while @entity3 is gone , his permanence remains and his life casts a long shadow			2
villain ? @entity48 is one of @entity3 's greatest enemies , who controls four mechanical arms attached to his body ' his life is still important to the book because it affects everything that @entity48 does as @entity3			1
seeing a supervillain go through this life is the point - trying to be better than the hero he opposed , ' @entity81 said			0
' @entity48 has sort of inspired by @entity3 's life			1
that 's what i mean when he talks about the shadow he casts , ' he said			0
the sentiment echoes what @entity13 said in the pages of ' @entity103 ' no. 15 , @entity17 said			0
editor @entity81 called it a fitting end to the old series , which sets the stage for a new one - ' @entity108 ' early next year - because it brings @entity3 full circle , from the start of his crime - fighting career to the end			2
' in his very first story , his uncle died because of something he did so the book has always been aimed at making @entity3 's life as difficult as possible , ' @entity81 said			2
' the book has always worked best when it 's about @entity3 's life , not @entity3 's			2
' and with @entity48 influenced by @entity3 's life - from @entity124 to former girlfriend @entity125 to ex-wife @entity126 - it will make him a better person , too			1
' because @entity48 knows all of those things and will make decisions on what he saw @entity3 going through , ' @entity81 said			1
' in a way , he gets the ultimate victory as he becomes a better hero			0
