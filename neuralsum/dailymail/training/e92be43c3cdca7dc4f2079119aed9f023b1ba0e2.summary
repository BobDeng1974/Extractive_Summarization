by @entity0 published : 09:59 est , 17 may 2013 updated : 12:38 est , 17 may 2013 for centuries @entity3 culture has prized women with a fuller figure			1
but that is all set to change as the women of @entity3 follow in the footsteps of their @entity11 counterparts in a desperate quest to slim down			1
just 20 years ago , @entity3 women as young as 11 or 12 would routinely be fattened up before their weddings - in part to make them seem older , but largely because being fat is seen as a symbol of wealth and status			1
and , let us not forget , because a well - fed bride is likely to attract a better dowry			2
weight loss is fast becoming a priority for women with thousands joining gyms , but in such a conservative country as @entity3 , a scene like this would have been unthinkable until a few years ago in some parts of @entity3 it is reported that fathers would cut a hole in their daughter 's bed and leave her there for a year , feeding her fat - laden food and drink until she became big enough to fill the hole			1
only then would she be considered large - and valuable - enough to be married off			0
but , inspired by stars such as @entity42 and @entity43 who invade their television screens and the magazines that are ever more available , modern @entity3 girls are fighting back against their fat - loving culture in an attempt to emulate their slender idols			1
related ] female - only gyms have opened all over the country and are attracting women in their thousands who are keen to lose weight and get fit - a concept that would have been unthinkable in the conservative country up until a few years ago			2
it is not only their figures that concern them either , rather the growing awareness of obesity - related illnesses and the complications that can lead from being drastically overweight			0
speaking to @entity64 , fitness trainer @entity63 said : ' in @entity3 , fat has become not wanted			2
@entity3 want to be like the people outside			2
@entity3 men much preferred the fuller figured look and fathers would even go as far as feeding their daughter fat - laded food and drink until she became big enough to be married off @entity73 , a professor at @entity74 who has researched obesity and body image in @entity3 , told them : ' the media has created this image among young women that they have to be very thin - they want to be skinny like the models they see in magazines and on satellite television			1
' just as in the @entity85 , it 's now very common for women to lose weight - rather than gain it - in time for their wedding day			2
' there has also been the introduction of a new term - ' style ' - into popular lexicon , essentially meaning a slim and pretty woman , which is a look so many of the modern @entity3 girls want to embody			1
thanks to the influences of super slender stars like @entity43 and @entity42 , @entity3 girls are desperate to emulate their slim idols this age old tradition , dating back centuries and coming to an end - as a widespread tradition , at least - is seen as the training women receive before getting married			1
it is deemed to prepare them for marriage and womanhood			0
during this period the girl is n't allowed to come into contact with any human other than an older woman who is in charge of caring for her			0
inside the room , the girl is massaged three times a day , fed six huge meals daily , drinks three pints of water three times each day and sleeps for hours on end			0
the girl is also given domestic training of home management such as cooking , childcare and housekeeping and is also taught how to make her husband happy			0
after reaching her optimum weight and leaving the fattening room , the girl is fed garri , a porridge made from cassava tubers , and native salads , by her husband			0
her diet is also full of foods such as rice , beans , more meat and fish			0
at the end of the period , a graduation ceremony takes place to celebrate her success .			0

girls as young as 11 or 12 were once fattened up before their weddings
hole was cut in bed and girls were fed until their bodies filled the space
now young @entity3 women want to slim down like @entity159 brides do
gym culture has *exploded* in the conservative @entity163 country
women now influenced by slender stars like @entity42 and @entity43
