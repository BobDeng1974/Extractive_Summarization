@entity0 has insisted he remains fully committed to @entity1 and said he only ever joined @entity2 as a way of staying fit ahead of the @entity5 season			1
@entity2 have faced a storm of criticism for their handling of @entity0 's situation since it was confirmed on @entity10 that the 36 - year - old will remain with the @entity13 champions until the end of the season , delaying his debut for sister club @entity1 until midway through their inaugural @entity5 campaign			1
there has been much confusion over @entity0 's contractual situation , with differing accounts as to when he signed for which club and for how long			1
@entity0 at a press conference in @entity1 as he was introduced by the @entity5 outfit @entity0 holds up a @entity27 scarf after ' joining ' the @entity5 club but @entity0 , in an interview with @entity30 , insists his commitment to @entity1 remains priority			1
describing the talks he had with @entity34 , chief executive of both @entity2 and @entity1 , after leaving @entity35 , @entity0 said : ' it was 100 per cent @entity1			1
i had sat down with @entity34 and it was all about @entity1			2
' there was no mention of @entity2			2
if they had wanted to speak to me on behalf of @entity2 , with @entity1 in the pipeline beyond that , they could have done that , because i was a free agent , but that was never the question at all			1
' @entity0 said @entity2 did not enter the equation until he began to consider ways to keep fit during the long wait for @entity1 's season to start , and insisted there was no question over his commitment to @entity1 going forward			1
' i have signed for @entity1 , ' he said			2
' the original intention was for that to start on january 1			0
i signed a @entity2 agreement in the interim ( in august )			2
now that has obviously changed			0
i have extended my period here and will join @entity1 later			2
@entity0 insists he is fully committed to his new career in the @entity5 despite the @entity2 loan ' that is what has frustrated me , that people were sort of saying " you knew what you were doing " , ' @entity0 added			1
' i never would have done that			0
if i had wanted to come to @entity2 , then i would stand up and come to @entity2			2
that would n't have been a problem			0
' and in terms of @entity2 being " sneaky " , they could have signed me on a free anyway if that 's what they wanted to do			0
people mention @entity77 but what difference would that have made ? ' no difference			0
it would have been a slippery move , a dodgy move , for nothing			0
the fact is i signed for @entity1 , then i signed for @entity2 in the interim and now it has been extended			1
' city manager @entity86 sought to draw a line under the affair on friday , saying : ' i think it 's an issue which is finished			0
' @entity0 now is here			0
i know that there a lot of different opinions about @entity0 , about that			0
i respect all of them , but the decision is taken already and @entity0 will stay here until the end of the season			0
' @entity0 has been on loan at @entity2 and joined the @entity102 club to keep himself fit for the @entity5 the former @entity35 man pictured in action during @entity2 's @entity13 clashes			1
