with Â£ 28million new boy @entity1 looking on from the bench all eyes were on @entity3			1
how would the big man react ? the arrival of last season 's @entity7 top scorer already seems to have prompted the departure of one @entity11 striker , with @entity12 not even included in @entity14 's squad for this one			1
@entity3 scored his first @entity7 goal since his brace against @entity18 on september 27 the @entity19 shows his excitement after scoring past @entity22 goalkeeper @entity21 @entity3 scored his side 's third goal in @entity11 's 5 - 0 win against @entity22 at the @entity26 @entity28 goals @entity1 : 9 @entity7 goals ( all for @entity30 ) @entity31 : 17 @entity7 goals @entity34 goals and while @entity3 landed a place in the starting xi it appeared as though this was the @entity38 's bid to turn up the heat			1
it did not take too much time to find an answer			0
26 seconds , to be precise			0
that is how long had passed when @entity3 nicked the ball from an inexplicably slumbering @entity46			1
the @entity47 then sent him flying and @entity31 made no mistake from the spot			0
simple , sharp and effective , it was the kind of vintage @entity11 that they had not seen in these parts for some time			2
@entity3 has often been accused of being selfish , despite being paid to score goals			2
@entity3 celebrates with his @entity11 team - mates after scoring against @entity56 's side the 28 - year - old played the full 90 minutes as @entity11 ran out 5 - 0 winners but after setting up @entity31 's penalty he showed his giving side again 10 minutes later when he found @entity61 with an admittedly - deflected pass			1
eight yards out and with the freedom of the @entity26 , the @entity63 could not miss. all that was missing now for @entity3 was a goal			2
he had to wait another 10 minutes for that			0
the pass , linked over the middle from @entity70 , was exquisite			0
the chest down and left - footed finish from @entity3 sublime			1
@entity74 hath no fury like a @entity19 scorned			2
before the half was over , and with a less forgiving referee than @entity78 , it could have been even better but @entity3 saw two decent penalty appeals turned down			0
@entity22 simply could not handle him			0
@entity22 goalkeeper @entity3 was unable to get a hand on to @entity3 's first - half strike @entity82 may have been back in the side , @entity1 may have been on the bench and @entity31 may have been looking close to his best but it was @entity3 's name the gleeful @entity11 fans belted out time and time again before half - time			1
only @entity21 , quick off his line , denied him a second as the cakewalk continued after the break			0
on the hour mark the new man came on for @entity31 and the pair linked well with the game won and the pressure off			0
@entity14 may ask him why he needlessly handled home a corner late on to pick up a deserved yellow card but the manager will have been pleased with the response			0
he may have been wearing gloves ( because it 's always tropical in @entity105 ) but there was nothing cold about red hot @entity3 here			1
@entity1 came off the substitutes ' bench to make his @entity11 debut			1

@entity3 scored in @entity11 's *emphatic* 5 - 0 win against @entity22
the @entity19 had not scored since 4 - 2 *victory* at @entity18 in september
@entity1 came off the substitutes ' bench in the 60th minute
