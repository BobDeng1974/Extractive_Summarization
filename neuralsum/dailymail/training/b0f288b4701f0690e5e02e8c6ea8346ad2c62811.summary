by @entity0 published : 10:37 est , 3 may 2012 updated : 12:12 est , 3 may 2012 more teens than ever are struggling to find work in the stubbornly sluggish @entity4 economy			1
less than 25 per cent of 16 to 19 - year - olds holds a job , down 10 per cent from just five years ago , according to the @entity7 , the lowest it has been since 1984			1
with summer around the corner , teenagers might have a better chance at landing a seasonal job , though prospects are still shaky			1
for those who think young : less than 25 per cent of @entity4 teens are currently employed , the lowest rate since 1984 on the lookout : one reason why teens may be struggling to find work is because older job seekers are taking jobs once filled by younger people according to @entity24 , around 40 to 50 per cent of teenagers across the @entity4 held down a job throughout the 1980s and 1990s			1
while the number was gently sloping downwards during the aughts , teenage employment took a steep plunge during the recession as others scrambled to fill what would normally be considered teenager ’s jobs			1
however , those are n’t the only reasons why more teens are n’t working			1
some teens – for whatever reason – are not actively seeking employment , while others have simply given up what they think is a fruitless search			1
the search , to many , is disheartening , and a blow to many young workers ’ resolve			2
the number of people seeking unemployment benefits fell last week by the most in nearly a year			0
the figure was a hopeful sign that hiring could pick up in coming months			0
the @entity50 said thursday that weekly unemployment aid applications fell 27,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 365,000			0
the four - week average , a less volatile measure , ticked up to 383,500 last week			1
applications are a measure of the pace of layoffs			0
when they fall below 375,000 , it generally suggests that hiring will be strong enough to lower the unemployment rate			0
last month , applications jumped after steadily declining since the fall			0
at the same time , hiring slowed			0
those figures sparked concerns that the job market was worsening after strong gains during the winter			0
but some economists said temporary layoffs stemming from the spring holidays might have inflated benefit applications			0
last week 's drop reversed the increase during april			0
applications are now roughly back at their level four weeks ago			0
- @entity78 ‘ there 's no replacement for the dignity that comes with earning your first pay check , ’ said secretary of labour @entity79 in a statement yesterday			1
in 2011 , the number of young people looking for but unable to find summer work increased by 745,000 to 4.1 million in july , which is typically the peak of youth employment			2
also yesterday , the @entity92 pledged to help lower - income youth find summer jobs in a move likely to appeal to younger voters crucial to president @entity98 's re-election campaign			1
the initiative is in partnership with the cities of @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 and is meant to add 110,000 jobs , internships and mentorships to the 180,000 summer work opportunities for 16 - 24 year olds that mr @entity98 has promised to create for 2012			1
under the new program , companies such as @entity111 , @entity112 , and @entity113 , as well as non-profits and federal agencies such as the @entity116 will offer paying jobs as well as mentorships and other training programs			2
last summer marked the lowest rate of youth employment for the month of july since 1948 , according to the labour bureau			2
the problem is exacerbated by socioeconomic status – the children of unemployed parents or poor families are less likely to find work			0
@entity131 , the director of the centre for @entity133 at @entity134 , told msnbc.com that the phenomenon is caused because many teens find work through word of mouth , often through friends and family			2
@entity142 increase : in 2011 , unemployment for those aged 16 - 24 hovered around 17.4 % ; the number has only grown since spiking : according to the @entity7 , unemployment in teens and young adults is the highest it 's been in decades the odds are against them , he noted , in part because they may not have role models to look up to , or they may have other obligations , such as no access to public transportation or a car to get them to and from work			1
he also found that teens were more likely to find a job if they already had one			2
@entity164 early in life serve more purpose than a pay check – oftentimes , it helps a teenager or young adult decide what they may want to spend the rest of their lives doing			0
a low percentage of citizens in the labour force present a multitude of problems , including a drain on @entity180 and tax revenues , as well as increasing income inequality , according to @entity183			1
the website also notes that the jobless numbers hurt @entity4 growth in general .			0

less than 25 % of teens aged 16 - 19 are employed
in 1980s and 1990s , around 40 to 50 per cent of teens had jobs
@entity92 *announced* yesterday its plans to create thousands of summer jobs for low - income teens
