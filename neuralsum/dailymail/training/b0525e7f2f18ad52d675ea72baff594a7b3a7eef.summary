november - the month moustaches are grown for charity - can cause men all over the world to become strangely attached to their facial hair			0
but come december these newly - transformed hairy faces will have a big choice to make : to beard or not to beard			1
now , to help with this decision , two @entity6 at @entity7 have condensed the centuries - long debate into a seven - minute video detailing the science behind the trend			1
pictured is @entity19 with @entity20 ( left ) and a full - grown beard ( right ) in the video , @entity22 and @entity23 claim that 60 per cent of verbal communication is affected by a person 's facial appearance			1
a bearded mr @entity23 highlights research by college students in which bearded men were seen as more dominant and masculine			1
he added that a study of managers found that men with long beards are seen as more competent and had better personalities			2
to which a clean - shaven mr @entity36 replied : ' masculinity or being dominate is n't always a good thing , especially in job interviews , because it is n't always about being a leader			2
it 's about being a team player			0
he continued that a study , albeit funded by @entity44 , suggested that @entity47 professionals prefer clean - shaven men			2
the study of more than 500 hr professionals discovered that 84 per cent agreed that well - groomed employees have higher chances of getting promoted , than those with stubble or beards			1
in a separate study , psychologists at @entity57 manipulated men â€™s facial hair in photographs , giving them varying degrees of facial hair			0
these images were then rated by 60 women who scored bearded men higher for masculinity , but also aggressiveness			2
never mind balding treatments - now there 's a ' fertiliser ' which promises to boost beard growth			2
the supplement , called @entity73 , is aimed at follically - challenged men desperate to grow facial hair but struggling to achieve anything more than stubble			0
the product claims to promote the growth of facial hair by stimulating follicles , resulting in a thicker , more luscious beard to match those sported by @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity19 , @entity86 and @entity88 actor @entity87			0
it was launched after it became fashionable to have a beard - and it has been such a hit that around 1,000 bottles are apparently flying off the shelves every day			2
@entity73 is made from a blend of vitamins and minerals that its makers claim nourish facial hair follicles			0
users are recommended a dosage of three capsules a day for between one month and six months			0
however , when the images were ranked on social status and respect , the bearded men regularly received higher scores than the clean - shaven ones			0
but could clean - shave men be making a comeback ? earlier this year , a study by scientists in @entity111 , @entity112 , found changes in men 's beard fashions may be guided by darwinian selection			1
the more beards there are , the less attractive they become , giving clean - shaven men an advantage , according to the scientists at the @entity122			2
when ' peak beard ' frequency is reached , men start reaching for the razors - a trend we many now be experiencing			0
whether or not it 's still fashionable , mr @entity23 says his beard helps save his face from damaging uv rays			1
this theory , however , has been disproved by research at the @entity135 on three life - size mannequin heads			0
scientists attached a long beard to one , added a short beard to the second , and added minimal facial hair to another			0
they mounted the dummies upright on a rotating platform exposed to the sun and measured how much uv protection they received			0
@entity85 with a beard , and without			0
a quick hashtag search of # @entity150 ( which stands for @entity151 i 'd like to @entity153 ) brings up more than 16,000 results on @entity155 , suggesting that the trend may be around for a while longer more than half of @entity159 women think men with bushy ' hipster ' beards ( @entity163 left ) are ' sexiest '			1
eight out of ten women thought bearded men ( @entity167 right ) looked more masculine , and over two thirds revealed they would prefer to date a man with a beard over one who was clean - shaven ' although protection is provided by the facial hair , it is not very high and the presence of facial hair should not be taken as a reason to spend extended periods of time in sunlight , ' they said			1
a separate study last week , by online beauty retailer @entity181 , found more than half of @entity159 women think men with bushy ' hipster ' beards are ' sexiest			1
' eight out of ten women thought bearded men looked more masculine and over two thirds revealed they would prefer to date a man with a beard over one who was clean - shaven			1
