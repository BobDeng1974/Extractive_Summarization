' nothing the court heard about you from doctors can begin to explain the savage , remitting attack you launched on a helpless woman , your wife , other than wilful anger , ' the judge said			2
' all this in the street , in front of your own and other people 's children , and in the view of horrified neighbours			1
' you were angry because your wife and sister were consorting together without your knowledge and approval			2
the stabbing happened outside @entity7 's sister house on @entity85 in @entity86 ' the loss and suffering by your children , and your wife 's mother and family , is unbearable for them			1
' i 'm prepared to accept you were facing personality problems throughout this time , but what you did could not be explained by mental abnormality			0
