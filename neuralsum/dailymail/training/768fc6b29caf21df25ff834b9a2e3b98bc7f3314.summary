some of the fellas seem to have gone girly and cute , while others were maybe inspired by @entity36 outfits when they got out the slap , but their efforts were all commendable			2
@entity39 , left , went with heavy eyeliner and blusher while , @entity42 , right chose a smoky eye and pink lips meanwhile the # @entity45 shows no signs of dieing down just yet as women continue to strip back their look in the name of charity			2
