the bowl was set on the table in front of me next to the bottle of beer with a metallic clink			2
my mind did not even bother to process what it was that had been set in front of me ; i was looking out over the @entity10 , talking , drinking and having fun			0
besides , who would set anything other than peanuts in front of someone at a bar ? my hand goes into the bowl to pick up one small object to send it hurtling into my mouth with the unerring aim of a man who has spent much of his life throwing food down his gullet			1
as it hits my tongue , something seems off			0
i wash it down with a swig of beer and pick up the bowl			0
crickets â€¦ this was my introduction to the art of eating insects , or entomophagy			1
in some areas of @entity61 , insects are an extremely popular snack , and are sold from street carts and in restaurants			1
to be completely honest , there are few snacks you can eat at a bar that are better tasting and more healthy than crispy crickets dusted with salt and chilli pepper or giant locusts ; you just need to remember to remove the legs and head			1
since that first introduction , i have continued to eat insects at least occasionally , and found that they are a healthy , tasty , and high - protein addition to my diet			1
with only 121 calories per 100 grams of crickets ( vs 567 calories for a comparable snack food , peanuts ) , it is clear to see how they are a good addition to the diet for a man waging a personal war against fat			1
also , unlike peanuts or crisps ( for all my @entity96 man v @entity98 friends ) , it is almost impossible to eat crickets non-stop			2
mr @entity31 , who lives in @entity61 , claims insects are a ' healthy , tasty , and high - protein addition ' to his diet recently , i was introduced to an excellent @entity104 delicacy from @entity61 that is essentially young wasps and termites with a few giant ants , cooked with lemongrass and chilli peppers and served over rice , you can see that particular dish below			1
in addition to being delicious , it was far and away healthier than the alternative stir - fried chicken or beef			1
available seasonally , this delicacy is something i would happily eat any day of the year			0
many of us coming from @entity119 cultures have been raised on steady diets of ' meat and potatoes ' , and have been told that they are healthy , balanced diets			0
while there is nothing intrinsically wrong with these things , other cultures around the world live with radically different diets and lifestyles that we can learn from			0
while eating insects is seen by us as a strange thing to do , they are , gram for gram , some of the best protein available			2
while eating insects is seen by many in the @entity136 as strange thing to do , they are , gram for gram , some of the best protein available companies such as @entity140 have been pioneering a baked - goods industry in which cricket flour is substituted for grain flour , making cookies which are protein rich , sustainable , gluten - free and far better for you than their alternative			1
over the past century , the food choices available in the western world have exploded in a decidedly negative way			0
we have the ability to transform our diets from the steady stream of junk food , to which so many are accustomed , to an entirely different and decidedly broader global culinary adventure			0
it is up to us to make decisions about the future of our waistlines and our planet , and the best option might be a little more creepy - crawly than we initially suspected			0
read more at @entity167 the @entity168 says insects are a more sustainable protein source than other more commonly eaten meats			1
the @entity173 's @entity172 says that more than two billion people - 30 per cent of the planet 's population - already supplement their diet with insects			2
insects are ' extremely efficient ' in converting feed into edible meat , according to the @entity168 report			1
on average , they can convert 2 kilograms ( 4.4lb ) of feed into 1 kilogram ( 2.2lb ) of insect mass. in comparison , cattle require 8 kilograms ( 17.6lb ) of feed to produce a kilo of meat			0
currently , most edible insects are gathered in forests and what insect farming does take place is often family - run and serves niche markets			2
the @entity168 says insects are a more sustainable protein source than other more commonly eaten meats but the @entity173 says mechanisation can ratchet up insect farming production			1
the fish bait industry , for example , has long farmed insects			0
insect farming is ' one of the many ways to address food and feed security , ' the food agency said			0
' insects are everywhere and they reproduce quickly , ' the agency said , adding they leave a ' low environmental footprint			0
' they provide high - quality protein and nutrients when compared with meat and fish and are ' particularly important as a food supplement for undernourished children , ' it said			2
insects can also be rich in copper , iron , magnesium , manganese , phosphorus , selenium and zinc , and are a source of fibre			1
the agency noted that its @entity229 is also examining the potential of arachnids , such as spiders and scorpions , although they are not strictly speaking insects			0
university biologists have analysed the nutritional value of edible insects , and some of them , such as certain beetles , ants , crickets and grasshoppers , come close to lean red meat or broiled fish in terms of protein per gram			1
last year , @entity245 reported an increase in sales of insect delicacies after the @entity168 suggested eating bugs could be the solution to worldwide food shortages			2
the department store recorded an 11 per cent increase in sales of @entity256 's insect - based snacks including @entity257 , @entity258 and @entity259 .			0

@entity261 @entity31 , 29 , lives in @entity61 and *regularly* feasts on insects
discovered them in a bar after reaching for what he thought was a peanut
was *shocked* to discover it was in fact a bowl of deep fried crickets
with 121 calories per 100g of crickets , they are much healthier than peanuts
these contain 567 calories for the same size serving
insects can also be rich in copper , iron , magnesium , manganese , selenium , phosphorus , and zinc - and are a source of fibre
@entity168 : insects are good , sustainable source of protein
