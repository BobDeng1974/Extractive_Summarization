by @entity0 published : 10:44 est , 28 may 2012 updated : 10:27 est , 29 may 2012 sentenced : @entity1 , was today imprisoned for the ' carefully thought out and skilfully executed ' scheme a codeine addict who replaced pills in a @entity6 pack with his own schizophrenia medication to fund his habit was jailed today for 18 months			1
the contaminated packs ended up in the hands of unsuspecting members of the public and two men ended up taking them			2
@entity1 cost the manufacturers £ 2.4million and saved himself just £ 7 by placing strips of an anti-psychotic drug in empty packets of the painkiller and swapping them for new packets at pharmacies			1
he was today imprisoned by a judge at @entity22 for the ' carefully thought out and skilfully executed ' scheme , which created a ' good deal of public fear and anxiety '			2
passing sentence , judge @entity27 told @entity29 : ' your acts caused very considerable financial harm , amounting to well over £ 2 million			2
' the costs included recalling the product , destroying suspect stock , investigating the problem which you caused , returning new products to the market and handling the reputational damage caused by you			2
the court has heard how @entity29 ’s scheme involved asking for @entity6 at a pharmacy counter and then attempting to pay for it with a card he knew would be declined			1
in doing this , he created sufficient distraction to discreetly swap the contaminated packet for the fresh one and walk away			2
his actions cost manufacturer @entity53 £ 2.4 million when the painkiller was recalled			2
@entity29 , who went to university at the age of 16 , took 32 tablets of the drug each day to feed his secret addiction			1
but after losing his job he struggled to pay for it			1
dangerous : the 31 - year - old replaced empty packets with the @entity63 he was being prescribed for schizophrenia , and the contaminated packs ended up in the hands of unsuspecting members of the public instead , the 31 - year - old replaced empty packets with the @entity63 he was being prescribed for schizophrenia , and two men , @entity74 and @entity75 , took the anti-psychotic drugs in error , believing them to be @entity6 , and were left feeling unwell			1
mr @entity74 and mr @entity75 swallowed the wrong tablets after mr @entity74 ’s wife , @entity79 , bought what she thought was a 32 - pack of @entity6 from a branch of @entity83 pharmacy in @entity84 in @entity85 , south - east @entity86 , on august 21 last year			1
the next day mr @entity74 , who was employed on a building site , took the packet to work			1
there he took three tablets and gave two to his colleague mr @entity75 , who was suffering neck pain			1
both men soon began to feel unwell , experiencing tiredness and dizziness			2
they later discovered the drug inside the packet was in fact @entity63 instead of @entity6			1
on july 24 and july 28 last year two other consumers realised the @entity6 they had bought also contained @entity63 instead , but did not swallow any			0
evidence : the court has heard how @entity29 's scheme involved asking for @entity6 at a pharmacy counter and then attempting to pay for it with a card he knew would be declined the first incident occurred when a woman bought a 32 - pack from a @entity83 pharmacy in @entity86 ’s victoria station and the second when a man bought a 32 - pack in a branch of boots in @entity113 in south - east @entity86			1
in a fourth incident , an assistant at a @entity116 pharmacy found seroquel tablets inside a @entity6 packet in the store			1
@entity29 , of @entity121 in @entity122 , was tracked down to his landlady ’s home in @entity125 , @entity126 , on september 23 after the origins of the @entity63 were traced			1
he admitted his actions and was later charged with causing a public nuisance			0
judge @entity131 told @entity29 his actions put the building site workers at significant risk and said others may have unwittingly taken the contaminated medication , leaving them similarly vulnerable			0
' it needs little imagination to consider the many different circumstances in which that might have happened , ' he said			0
' what if they had been driving a car ? or operating machinery ? in short , the risk of potential harm was very high			0
' he acknowledged @entity29 was a man of good character and took steps to overcome his addiction			1
telling @entity29 he would serve half his sentence behind bars , minus the days already spent in custody , the judge added : ' what you did was potentially very dangerous , caused very substantial economic loss and was something for which you must take responsibility , not in the sense that you intended the consequences of it but because you chose to ignore them			0
' an overdose of @entity63 can cause coma , tachycardia ( rapid heart rate ) and hypertension ( high blood pressure ) , she said at the opening of his sentencing on friday			0
' the consequences of the defendant ’s actions were wide - ranging and spread beyond the actual medical harm suffered by mr @entity74 and mr @entity75			0
( they ) must have been to cause fear and alarm among the public as regards the safety of their health , and that ca n’t be minimised , ' she added			0
lawyer @entity186 , defending , said the figure of £ 2.4 million was an ' eye - popping ' one for an offence that centred on @entity29 saving himself £ 7			0
an extensive investigation was launched when the health scare broke out as ' it could not have been perceived that what was occurring was a young man in a very pathetic state of health trying to save himself £ 7 ' , mr @entity186 said			0
' he ’s the most remorseful that one could be , to know the effect of his crime			0
' he described @entity29 as a musically talented and intelligent man ' with so much potential ' , who had begun but not completed a string of degrees			0
@entity29 had been ' reckless and stupid ' but his mind had been addled at the time , mr @entity186 said			0
the defendant nodded quietly as the nature of his addiction was detailed in court this afternoon			2
he bowed his head as the judge spoke of the implications of his actions , before waving to a supporter in the public gallery , as he was led from the dock .			0
