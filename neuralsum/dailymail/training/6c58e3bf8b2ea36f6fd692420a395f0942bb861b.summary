by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 died aged 22 months after choking on a cube of jelly during a play session at @entity7 nursery in @entity8 , south @entity9 staff at a nursery where a toddler choked to death on a cube of jelly were found to be ' grossly negligent ' by failing to provide appropriate care , a coroner has ruled			1
@entity2 , aged 22 months , fell unconscious during a ‘ free flow ’ play session at the @entity7 nursery in @entity8 , south @entity9			1
on the morning of @entity2 's death in august 2012 , there were 11 members of staff working at the nursery , supervising 30 children aged up to four years old , @entity20 heard			1
the rooms of the nursery were opened up allowing children of different groups to play in a ' free flow ' session that encourages them to engage in a range of indoor and outdoor activities			1
one of the games was a sensory table that included cubes of jelly			2
but no one saw @entity2 pick up the jelly or put it in her mouth , the court was told			1
@entity43 , representing @entity2 's parents , @entity45 and @entity46 , said : ' no adult in that nursery saw @entity2 take jelly from the table			1
' no adult saw or heard @entity2 put jelly in her mouth			1
no adult saw or heard @entity53 choke			2
' if she coughed or struggled for breath or made noises , she was not seen or heard			2
no adult saw or heard @entity2 fall to the ground			1
' if children must be supervised at all times do you really think that there was adequate supervision ? ' the nursery staff argued there was adequate supervision and they had no way of knowing the jelly was a choking hazard			1
today the jury delivered a verdict of ' accidental death with neglect ' and said that the nursery staff had been ' grossly negligent ' in supervising her			1
her parents , who described their daughter as ' happy ' and ' bubbly ' wept as the verdict was read out			0
coroner @entity78 said : ' the jury concluded there was a gross failure on the part of the nursery to provide appropriate care for @entity2			1
' there was inadequate communication between all staff which was a gross failure			2
@entity2 's father @entity45 and mother @entity46 , pictured court after an earlier hearing , described their daughter as ' bubbly ' and ' happy ' and wept as the verdict was delivered ' there was a significant failure to carry out adequate risk assessments relating to the jelly cube			1
' the jury has ruled her death was accidental contributed to by neglect			0
' the inquest previously heard claims the nursery ’s operations manager @entity100 ‘ deliberately minimised ’ the incident in his formal report to @entity104			1
he also admitted picking out a member of staff , @entity106 , at random and suspending her following the death			0
mr @entity100 said he had done so ‘ because she had cold sores ’ but miss @entity106 ‘ thought it was something to do with @entity2 ’s death ’			1
dr @entity78 told the jury : ‘ he stated there was no logic to this suspension ’			0
but mr @entity100 ‘ specifically denied there had been a management cover - up of this incident ’ , dr @entity78 added			0
the coroner recalled how the toddler ’s parents were first told that ‘ an unknown medical condition had not been ruled out as the cause of @entity2 ’s death ’			1
earlier , the inquest was told that a @entity126 crew removed a piece of ‘ jelly - like substance ’ from @entity2 ’s airway			1
she was taken by ambulance to @entity131 but died later the same day			0
the cause of death was asphyxiation caused by a foreign body			0
speaking after the verdict , mr @entity46 said : ' we feel very satisfied the jury reached the correct verdict			0
' nothing we can say or do can bring back our beautiful daughter @entity2 nor relieve the pain of not seeing our little bundle of joy grow up with our family			1
' all our hopes and dreams for @entity53 have been taken from us			0
' this hearing , although hard to bear has helped us and we are grateful to the coroner for conducting a thorough inquest			0
speaking after the verdict , mr @entity46 said : ' nothing we can say or do can bring back our beautiful daughter @entity2 nor relieve the pain of not seeing our little bundle of joy grow up with our family ' ' this has provided us with an opportunity to better understand the circumstances in which @entity2 died			1
' but he said that unanswered questions remained following the inquest			0
he added : ' the nursery has continued to deny any responsibility or accountability for @entity2 's death in the face of overwhelming evidence and even to this day continue to blame the jelly			1
' we are absolutely disgusted by the behaviour of the nursery , they mislead @entity104 by suspending a junior member of staff who had nothing to do with her death			2
' we hope @entity104 and @entity174 fully investigate the matter			0
' the nursery has shown no compassion or remorse and the manner in which the @entity180 has conducted itself has been regrettable and has added considerably to our pain			0
' our aim has always been to establish the truth of how @entity2 died so that other nurseries and governing bodies may learn by the mistakes made here			2
' we believe the @entity187 has gone some way to achieving that			0
' ' at the time we did not appreciate how dangerous jelly play could be			2
immediately after the tragedy , we removed all free flow and food play from our nurseries ' - @entity195 , owner of @entity196 mr @entity46 told the hearing they had previously had concerns about the nursery after their daughter had been twice bitten on the face , and they had wanted to remove her from there			1
he added : ' she was loud , she was only 22 months , she was forming her personality			0
' she would pull her brother off toys , push him away			0
' she was bubbly , she was loved by everyone			0
she was an infectious child			0
' if she ever saw someone she would go up to anybody , she was n't afraid of anybody			0
she loved to get out			0
' @entity196 is a family - owned business with other nurseries in @entity8 , @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity216			1
@entity195 , owner of @entity196 , said in a statement today : ' we would like to express our deepest sympathies to @entity2 ’s family			2
' for the last 18 years we have always strived to provide the best possible childcare by exceeding all of the national standards set by @entity104 and other agencies including the quality of our buildings , resources , staff ratios and training			0
' during the hearing the medical expert gave evidence that even a small piece of jelly , in particular , if inhaled , could pose a silent and rapid asphyxiation hazard , from which it is almost impossible to recover			0
' in 2012 , as was nationally accepted best practice , we were operating free flow play at set times in our nursery			2
one of these activities was a sensory play table dressed with prehistoric animals in a spaghetti and jelly swamp			2
' at the time we did not appreciate how dangerous jelly play could be			2
immediately after the tragedy , we removed all free flow and food play from our nurseries			0
' currently , we know that food and jelly play remains prevalent in many nurseries and we welcome that the coroner will be making a report regarding the danger of raw jelly in childcare settings			2
' we remain devastated that the tragedy of this day two years ago can not be undone and our thoughts remain with @entity2 ’s family			1
