' passing sentence , judge @entity153 told @entity0 : ' there was an argument between you , triggered , it seems , by her express wish to attend a college course to improve her @entity9			1
' that wish was , in my judgement , a wish for a degree of independence on her part , which you would not tolerate			0

' she said : ' the injuries she suffered were so severe that the first officer on the scene thought she was dead , her defensive injuries showed that he stabbed her with such force that the knife went right through her hand , breaking her forefinger			2
' it was only after the officer felt for her pulse , that he realised she was still alive and even then it was touch and go , with the victim undergoing life - threatening surgery and several harrowing weeks in intensive care			0
