the @entity10 said in a letter on friday that the costume is offensive to 9/11 victims and will cause ‘ negative stereotypes about turbans and beards that have led to violence and discrimination against @entity2 and other minorities ’			1
the @entity10 offered an image of the original costume and the @entity23 leader , @entity22 , as part of their letter			1
similarity : the @entity2 community says the @entity28 costume , left , bears too much resemblance to the @entity23 terrorist @entity22 , right ' we apologise ' : @entity3 , who called the costume the ' @entity34 ' , pulled the product from their website the letter : on friday the @entity10 asked @entity3 to discontinue the sale of the costume the group also sent letters to retailers such as @entity44 , which listed the costume under the banner ‘ @entity48 ’s @entity47 ’			1
@entity3 described it as ‘ @entity34 ’			0
the costume appears to be manufactured by @entity51 , and is for sale on the sites of retailers such as @entity55 and @entity56 , among others			0
@entity58 , director of law and policy at the @entity10 , told @entity60 he doubts the costume would make people who had lost loved ones in the 9/11 attacks comfortable			2
a @entity3 spokesperson said they ‘ disabled this item for purchase and are in the process of immediately removing it from our site ’ , according to the @entity60			0
‘ we sincerely apologise to any customers who may have been offended by this costume			0
’ spiritual : @entity2 wear turbans due to their religious beliefs			2
it represents honour , self - respect , courage , spirituality and piety ignorance : about 70 per cent of @entity86 misidentify turban - wearing @entity2 ( pictured ) as @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 or members of the @entity92 faith wrong culture : the @entity2 are often mistaken for being @entity94 because of their turban			1
however , @entity94 do not wear turbans , they wear a @entity97 , such as this man from @entity99 humiliation : @entity100 declined to take off his turban after judge @entity102 of @entity103 told him to ' remove that rag ' attack : @entity106 , an professor at @entity107 , was brutally attacked and called ' terrorist ' and ' @entity22 ' in an incident that required him to get jaw surgery @entity2 @entity86 face an extremely high degree of ignorance surrounding their religious practices and beliefs			1

the complaint to the retailers comes in the wake of a brutal hate crime last week against a respected member of the @entity86 @entity2 community , dr. @entity106 , a professor at @entity107			1
his attackers shouted ‘ terrorist ’ and ‘ @entity22 ’ and pulled at his beard and turban in an attack that required him to get jaw surgery			2
and earlier this year , @entity100 , a long - haul truck driver , was told to take off his turban in court after being arrested by police officers who called him a ' terrorist '			2
in court judge @entity102 of @entity137 @entity103 said ‘ remove that rag ’			0
@entity58 refused , saying that to remove his turban would be sacrilegious and shameful			0
the turban is an important part of the religious identity for most @entity2			0
it is an article of faith that represents honour , self - respect , courage , spirituality and piety			0
the men also wear the turban partly to cover their long hair , which their religion strictly forbids them to cut .			0

the @entity10 sent a letter on friday telling the retailer the costume is offensive to 9/11 victims
the costume resembles the @entity23 leader , @entity22
according to the @entity2 , this will *perpetuate* negative stereotypes about turbans and beards
they said @entity3 should use more ' common sense ' in future
70 per cent of @entity86 misidentify turban - wearing @entity2 as @entity87 and other religious groups
the letter comes in the wake of the brutal attack last week on @entity106 , a professor at @entity107 , who was called ' @entity22 ' and ' terrorist ' while the attackers broke his jaw
