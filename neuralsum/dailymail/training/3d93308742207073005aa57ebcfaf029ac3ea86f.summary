threat : deputy prime minister @entity1 says he could block any moves to cut the top rate of income tax @entity1 , the deputy prime minister , today issued a stunning threat to stymie chancellor @entity7 's plans to abolish the 50p tax rate			1
he said cutting rates for the wealthy while millions were struggling to make ends meet could ' destroy ' public support for the entire tax system			2
in an interview with @entity15 no the eve of today 's opening of the @entity19 conference , mr @entity1 also acknowledged that the government had to do more to boost growth in the economy by adopting what he called a ' @entity24 '			1
his remarks risk a clash with mr @entity7 , the conservative chancellor of the exchequer , who has made no secret of his desire to abolish the 50p rate on incomes over £ 150,000			1
there is vocal opposition to the top rate of tax , particularly from the financial sector			2
earlier this month , 20 leading economists warned that @entity38 now has one of the highest personal tax regimes in the industrialised world			2
and on thursday right - leaning think - tank the @entity42 said that the 50p rate was encouraging the wealthy to dodge taxes and move their money overseas			2
however mr @entity1 made clear that as far as the @entity19 were concerned , the priority had to be reducing the burden of taxation on lower and middle income earners			1
' we are not there to rush to the aid of the top 1 per cent of very , very rich people who are not in straitened circumstances , ' he said			2
' if millions of taxpayers feel they are being overlooked , ignored and passed over , as preference is given to people who need the least amount of help at the moment , you destroy the very fabric of consensus without which a sensible tax system can not survive			2
' it would be utterly incomprehensible for millions of people who work hard , do their best for their families , and play by the rules , if suddenly the priority is to give 300,000 people at the very , very top a tax break			2
' it is not going to happen - certainly not until there is significant progress on giving tax breaks to those on lower and middle incomes			2
' clash : @entity7 , the conservative chancellor of the exchequer , has made no secret of his desire to abolish the 50p rate of tax in incomes over £ 150,000 while mr @entity1 's show of muscle - flexing on the eve of the party conference season will play well with @entity19 activists , it will infuriate many @entity93 who are determined to see an end to the 50p rate			1
however mr @entity1 made clear the @entity19 would back abolition in the long run only if it was not raising much revenue and if it was replaced by new taxes on ' unearned income '			1
these could include a 1 per cent annual ' mansion tax ' on homes worth more than £ 2million , a land tax , and restricting tax relief on pensions to the basic 20p rate			0
mr @entity1 also risked further antagonising by mr @entity7 - who has always insisted there was no ' @entity111 ' alternative to his deficit reduction plan - by conceding the @entity113 had adopted a ' @entity24 ' to ensure growth			1
' we need to do more in government			0
we are doing more , ' he said			0
' for too long people have assumed that , because we are sticking to the fiscal plan , somehow the government is impotent			1
' ' cuts are criminal ' : a hoarding outside the @entity126 hotel where @entity1 and members of the @entity19 will stay three people have been charged with causing a danger to road users after a protest near the venue hosting the @entity19 ' autumn conference			1
the men - a 19 - year - old from @entity135 , a 21 - year - old from @entity137 and a 22 - year - old from @entity139 in @entity140 - were arrested last night after an incident near @entity143 's @entity142 ( @entity144 )			0
a spokeswoman for @entity146 said the men had been charged this afternoon after they allegedly scaled a bridge which connects the @entity126 to the @entity144 last night to unfurl a banner			0
the spokeswoman said : ' as a result of these actions debris fell into @entity152 , creating a hazard to pedestrians and motorists			0
' @entity146 continues to monitor a small peaceful protest near to the @entity144			0
whilst we recognise and support the democratic right for people to peacefully protest , we continue to balance this with ensuring the safety and security of all those attending these events , as well as the wider @entity143 community			0
' those charged will appear at @entity168 on monday			0
as the @entity19 conference opened today , members were told they face the challenge of breaking down the ' dependency culture ' and setting people free			1
councillor @entity174 , @entity176 's @entity175 urged activists listening at the @entity144 to come up with policies which ' strike a chord with the electorate '			0
councillor @entity174 , who is also the @entity176 's deputy leader said the site was important as it saw the formation of the @entity184 in 1877 and a speech by @entity186			1
he said : ' the challenge for us not only as a party , but as part of the @entity191 is how we can break down the dependency culture that was created by the last @entity113			0
' we have to set people free , we have to give them the opportunity of getting away from what has become state subsidies			0
' @entity197 added : ' so the challenges that we have over the next few days are to come up with policies that strike a chord with the electorate , who will point the country in the right direction and ensure that it all started in @entity143 because of our heritage as far as @entity208 is concerned			0
' the @entity19 leadership will attempt to notch up an early success with activists today by opening the conference with a pledge to press ahead with moves to legalise same - sex marriages			1
pledge : @entity217 dem equalities minister @entity216 will promise a public consultation on gay marriage equalities minister @entity216 will use her speech to promise a public consultation early next year , ensuring legislation can be in place by the time of the next general election in may 2015			0
however - in a possible sign of conference season tensions within the coalition - senior conservatives were making clear the move had been pushed through with the personal backing of @entity231			1
the five - day conference event is the first major gathering of @entity19 activists since nearly 700 of its councillors were ejected in a local election bloodbath in may			1
that humiliation was swiftly followed by a crushing referendum defeat for its cherished ambition of changing the voting system			0
in what party president @entity243 describes in his conference message as a ' particularly distressing ' year , the party has also faced student anger and riots over its u-turn on scrapping tuition fees and seen its opinion poll rating remain very low			1
the election results sparked calls for mr @entity1 to quit as party leader but he instead promised a ' muscular ' campaign to exert a stronger @entity19 influence over government policy			1
apparent successes , notably in securing extensive changes to the @entity262 - led @entity261 reforms , appear to have calmed internal dissent though that issue could still prove a flashpoint with staunch critics of even the reformed package seeking a vote on the issue .			0
