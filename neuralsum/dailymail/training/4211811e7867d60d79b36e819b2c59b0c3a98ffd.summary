terminally ill great - grandfather @entity6 , 69 , from @entity20 , @entity21 , outside his local pub the @entity34 in @entity20 , after he was attacked from behind by two men in their 20s while on his way home ' i looked behind me to make sure no - one was following me , but out of nowhere , i got smacked on the back on the head and fell to the ground and landed on my stomach			1
' they took my wallet out of my pocket , took the cash out then threw the wallet very aggressively in my face			2
then they called me a few names and started kicking me in the stomach			2
they toddled off up the road , never to be seen again			2
' diagnosed with prostate cancer last october and given 12 months to live , mr @entity6 's failing health has deteriorated ever since			1
but in the days leading up to the attack on august 5 , he regained some strength in his legs and felt confident enough to walk alone to his local pub , the @entity34 in @entity20 , and join his friends for a drink			1
but as he walked home , the two thugs , both aged around 20 , attacked him from behind , one punching him in the back knocking him to the ground , before the other stood on his back and stole Â£ 100 from his wallet			1
the pair kicked and swore at the defenceless pensioner as he lay on the pavement before making off			2
cancer sufferer @entity6 said having a pint with his friends is one of his few remaining pleasures mr @entity6 added : ' it wo n't stop me going out , but i 'm looking behind me all the time now , i 'm very cautious			1
i still go out , but i do n't walk alone anymore			2
it 's a short distance , but it 's not worth the risk			0
' it 's a cowardly way to attack someone			0
i 've got prostate cancer and they 're kicking me in the stomach			1
they are cowards and just typical hoodies			0
i just do n't want it to happen again			0
' they should have a conscience and give themselves up			0
one day , this will come back to them			0
' they do n't deserve to be living , they 're not human beings			0
luckily , i 've got a lot of close friends around me , looking after me			0
it wo n't happen again if they have anything to do with it			0
' detective constable @entity101 , of @entity102 , said : ' this was a vicious and cowardly attack on a frail and dying man			0
' he has terminal cancer and is very ill. in fact he does n't have long to live			1
one of his remaining pleasures in life is to walk to his local pub for a couple of beers with his friends			1
' now because of the despicable actions of these cowards , this modest pleasure has been utterly destroyed			0
' walking to and from the pub was part of his ritual , no doubt bringing him a modicum of independence			1
now he has to get a taxi out of fear			0
' the robbers probably would n't have known about his condition , but one look at him would have told them he was frail , vulnerable and clearly not going to put up a fight - precisely why these bullies picked on him no doubt			2
' anyone in the area near the allotments on @entity138 in @entity20 around midnight on august 5 is urged to call police			1
