@entity0 was struck down with pneumonia linked to bovine tb after being infected by her pet kitten more people will catch potentially - fatal tuberculosis from their cats because the disease is so widespread in wildlife , pet owners were warned last night			1
@entity10 , president of the @entity11 , told @entity12 : ‘ it is going to happen again			1
it ’s low risk , but not no risk			2
’ his warning came after public health chiefs revealed that cats suffering from the bovine form of the disease had passed it to their owners for the first time			2
calling on vets to ensure the problem was ‘ on their radar , ’ mr @entity10 said bovine tb would persist in family pets even if it was eradicated in cattle because there is a ‘ high endemic problem ’ in wildlife			1
although the focus has been on badgers because they have long been linked to @entity38 in cows , other animals – such as foxes , hedgehogs , rats , mice and voles – can contract tuberculosis			1
a cat owner himself , mr @entity10 said infected animals should be put down and added he would even put his own pet to sleep , ‘ with a heavy heart , ’ to minimise the health risks to family and neighbours			1
unlike cattle with @entity38 , it is not compulsory for infected cats or dogs to be put to sleep			1
many pet owners resist the advice , but vets believe that if there are more such cases the law will be changed			0
in what is thought to be the first case of its kind in the world , 19 - year - old @entity0 told this week how she was struck down with agonising pneumonia linked to bovine tuberculosis after being infected by her pet kitten			1
she had to have emergency surgery followed by further treatment			0
miss @entity0 ' cat @entity77 died two days after his owners discovered a wound on his stomach another victim suffered similar symptoms and @entity0 ’s mother @entity84 contracted a dormant form of the disease , which attacks the lungs and can cause fatal complications			1
the kitten was one of nine cats infected in the @entity93 area of @entity94 last year – probably after coming into contact with diseased wildlife around @entity97			1
five of the cats died , one is missing and the other three have been treated and are being kept as pets – despite the continuing risks			2
experts say cats are more likely to be infected with bovine tb than other household pets because they are predators that hunt rodents which might have the disease , though it is possible for dogs to pass it on to humans			1
latest government figures show that from 2008 to 2012 , 91 cats and seven dogs caught bovine tb			2
@entity10 , president of the @entity11 , says vets need to have risk ' on their radar ' there are other strains of tuberculosis that pets and other animals can pick up but they are not serious notifiable diseases and pose no threat to humans or other animals			1
while the risk to humans from an infected cat is low , most vets would advise against keeping such an animal if there were babies , children or other vulnerable people in the household			1
mr @entity10 said : ‘ cats are particularly vulnerable because they chase after mice and voles			1
in the past , most cases of bovine tb in cats have occurred in hotspot areas of the disease such as the @entity147 and @entity148			2
‘ what is unusual about the @entity93 case is that @entity94 is not considered a @entity38 hotspot area yet there was a cluster of nine infected cats			1
’ @entity155 , the @entity93 vet who reported the outbreak , and whose own cat @entity159 was infected and has gone missing , said : ‘ we live near @entity97 where cattle graze			2
there have been some cases of @entity38 in cattle on the common			1
but my theory is that a stray cat became infected and passed it on to the others			2
‘ that stray cat has never been identified and has now probably died of the disease and that is why we have not had any cases for a year			2
’ two of the other cats to have died in the @entity93 outbreak were @entity175 , owned by @entity176 , 38 , and @entity177 , owned by @entity178			0
dr @entity181 , head of gastrointestinal , emerging and zoonotic diseases at @entity180 , said : ‘ this was a very unusual cluster of @entity38 in domestic cats			1
mocha ( left ) died after contracting bovine tb and @entity177 ( right ) also caught the disease - possibly from cattle ‘ these are the first documented cases of cat - to - human transmission			1
although @entity180 has assessed the risk of people catching this infection from infected cats as being very low , we are recommending that households and close contacts of cats with confirmed infection should be assessed and receive advice			1
’ mr @entity155 added that owners worried their pet has bovine tb should only contact a vet if the cat has a wound that is not healing , respiratory problems or chronic weight loss			0
previously , most human cases of bovine tb in humans have been among farmers and vets who work with cattle or @entity218 scientists who have worked with badgers			2
however , five years ago , a former veterinary nurse from @entity221 , her daughter and the family dog were reported to have caught the disease from a badger that wandered into their garden			1
@entity228 has one of the highest rates of human @entity38 in @entity231 , though the vast majority of sufferers people not inoculated against the disease , including migrants from @entity237 and @entity238			1
@entity239 and @entity240 have some of the highest tb rates in @entity238			0
dog owners are being urged to hose their pets after taking them for walks to protect them from a mystery illness that has so far killed 28 dogs in @entity228			2
experts investigating the outbreak suspect it is similar to @entity250 which struck greyhounds in @entity252			0
the disease is believed to be caused by @entity254			0
@entity255 , a springer spaniel owned by @entity258 's @entity257 died after a muddy walk one owner has warned he is convinced it can be picked up by dogs licking mud off their fur			0
the earliest signs of @entity250 are lesions on the legs , chest and abdomen , which spread across the skin			0
this is followed by lethargy , loss of appetite , vomiting and kidney failure			0
among the victims are two springer spaniels owned by forester @entity257 , from @entity278 , @entity279			0
the dogs , @entity281 and @entity255 , had been put straight into their outdoor kennels after a walk and not washed			0
mr @entity257 says this cost them their lives as a third dog , @entity289 , survived after being cleaned and allowed into the house after the same walk			0
he said : ‘ i ’m convinced the link is @entity281 and @entity255 were not washed , they groomed themselves , licked their coats and ingested the mud and soil			0
‘ @entity289 also became ill but did not get kidney failure			0
i believe giving her a bath saved her life			0
’ he added : ‘ tissue samples from my dogs were sent to experts in @entity252 who confirmed their condition “ mimicked ” @entity250			0
experts in the @entity252 believe the greyhounds died after eating raw meat infected with @entity254			0
i did n’t feed raw meat to my dogs but @entity254 is a common bacteria and it can trigger a toxin which affects the kidneys			0
’ vets have investigated @entity254 as the trigger for the disease in the @entity228 but there is no proof the bacteria is linked to the dog deaths .			0

pets will keep catching disease because of ' endemic problem ' in *nature*
foxes , hedgehogs , rats , mice and voles can spread tuberculosis
*teenager* @entity0 has told how she caught @entity38 from a kitten
@entity10 , of @entity11 , says risk continues
he thinks infected animals should be put down to stop spread to humans
