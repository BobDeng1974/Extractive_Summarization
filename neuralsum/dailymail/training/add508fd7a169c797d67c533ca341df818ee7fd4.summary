by @entity1 reporter a couple who struggled to have a baby were stunned when doctors said their laptop was to blame			1
@entity6 was told having the appliance on his lap had caused heat damage to his sperm			1
and , as a result , the 30 - year - old electrician and his wife , @entity12 , also 30 , were finding it harder to conceive			1
mr @entity6 started using his laptop on a table instead and three months later mrs @entity17 became pregnant with baby daughter @entity18			1
@entity6 and his wife @entity12 were delighted when they have baby @entity18 after discovering a hot laptop could be stopping them from conceiving mrs @entity17 said : ' i 've never heard of this happening before , when the doctors told us it was a real shock			1
' @entity6 would use his laptop in the evenings for a couple of hours on and off while we were watching television			1
' he would use it for work and general things like @entity33			0
we had absolutely no idea the damage it was causing him			0
' the couple , from @entity37 in @entity38 , visited their gp after trying for a baby for six months without success			1
initially it was thought mr @entity6 's fertility had been affected by mumps - which he had suffered with at the age of 21			1
mrs @entity17 , a pathologist , said : ' about six months after we started trying i was getting frustrated and mentioned it to my doctor			2
' you do n't think it will be that hard to get pregnant			0
we both went back to have a chat and the doctor put @entity6 forward for a fertility test			2
' @entity17 , 11 months in october 2010 the couple were referred to the andrology department of the pathology unit at @entity58 in @entity59			2
mr @entity6 said : ' because i had the mumps i needed to get tested			1
we were concerned they would find something but then we wanted a baby so we had to find out			0
' i did n't think about the worst - case scenario and just had to get on with it			2
' tests revealed mr @entity6 was producing a healthy amount of sperm but they had suffered heat damage			1
under the microscope it was possible to see that the tail of the sperm had coiled around the head , meaning it could n't swim quickly to the egg			2
the problem is common in chefs - who work in hot environments - but can also be caused by laptop computers			2
mr @entity6 said : ' i never thought using a laptop would affect the quality of my sperm			1
after asking if i was a chef , the next thing was ' do you use a laptop ? ' ' i was using it daily and had n't given it a second thought			0
it was quite shocking really			0
' after that mr @entity6 made sure he placed his laptop either beside him or on a table			1
mrs @entity17 said : ' we carried on trying and we were n't having any luck			0
we thought it was n't going to happen so we started planning a trip to travel around @entity98			0
but then i did a test and found out i was expecting			0
' @entity18 , now 10 months , was born on december 8 last year			0
proud parent mr @entity6 is now encouraging more men to be aware of the dangers of laptops - and not to be shy if they think there might be a problem with fertility			1
he said : ' generally men clam up and do n't want to talk about anything to do with genitals			0
do n't be scared of going through the process			0
i wanted children and so i got tested			0
' @entity6 had been using his computer on his lap for a few hours each evening			1
doctors said it caused his sperm to coil up , making it difficult for them to swim biomedical andrologist @entity117 , from @entity58 , confirmed the heat of the laptop can have an effect on sperm			1
she said : ' @entity6 had been producing a healthy amount of sperm but looking under a microscope i saw that there was heat damage			1
' @entity6 was using his laptop every day and for a few hours			2
it would get really hot , which would have an effect on his sperm			0
' this showed up under the microscope			0
the tail of the sperm had coiled around the head			0
' this means it ca n't swim quickly and get to the egg			0
i would say men should place the laptop on a table , rather than on their lap , as this can make a difference			2

couple , both 30 , visited doctors after trying to conceive for six months
doctors said heat from a laptop had damaged mr @entity6 's sperm
three months after mr @entity6 stopped using his computer in his lap his wife conceived
they now have an 11 - month - old daughter
