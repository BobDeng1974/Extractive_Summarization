the contestants may look a million dollars when they step out to perform on @entity1 but backstage it 's all last minute wardrobe changes , demands from @entity4 and lots of stitching and sequins			2
@entity8 followed @entity9 , the show 's head stylist , around for a day to see exactly what she gets up to and how she ensures the contestants transform from budding singers to fully - fledged @entity1 stage stars			1
' a lot of people ask me how we manage the @entity1 wardrobe , where do the pieces come from , how do we put the outfits together , how we work with brands and shops to pull pieces in that we need , ' explains @entity9 as she sets off on her whirlwind day out			1
' we are briefed on the contestants ' songs and the overall visual ideas for the performance , ' she explains			0
from this meeting , @entity9 's first port of call for any of the looks is her fashion hub on @entity43			2
off they go ! @entity9 and her team set off for the shops and spend the day meeting fashion brands and curating looks for the contestants based on the production team and judges ' demands she said : ' my team and i set this up a couple of weeks before the series began , i call it my mini @entity60			1
we have rails and shelves for each contestant , all clearly labelled and for all sorts of fashion eventualities			0
' the hub can provide a lot of what i need , but depending on the theme , i do also have to go out and about to bring in more pieces - so start a whirlwind of visits to designers , showrooms , shops and pr offices to gather in what we need			0
@entity9 takes some of her team with her and they keep checking back in with the hub to drop off anything they have collected and take stock of where they are up to			2
made to measure : @entity9 and her assistants root around @entity89 's trendiest shops to source a stage - worthy outfit for each singer she explained : ' remember it is n't just the saturday night performance look we are creating , but also the sunday ensemble and the sunday sing - off outfits			1
' we have 24 hours to bring these looks together , so it is important we move fast , work quickly and keep focused on the job - but , of course , all in style ! '			0
while it may seem that @entity9 has the world 's best job , it does n't come without its pressures			2
indeed , on saturday night , just hours before showtime , the team decided to completely change @entity109 's dress			1
' the inspiration was @entity111 and the high glamour of the 40s			0
we had created a gown for her from a @entity117 dress , adding a fake fur cape to the hem			0
' at the dress rehearsal on saturday afternoon , we decided that the look would work better in white - but we had our work cut out with about an hour to turn it around			2
' home from home : @entity9 and her team are based in the style hub , which they call their mini @entity60 , and store all of the clothes before the weekend 's show say cheese ! @entity9 has become extremely close with the contestants , such as @entity133 , and tries to give them confidence via their outfits the team used their creative prowess to completely revamp the look			1
they took a @entity142 cocktail dress and removed the sleeves , deepened the neckline and one of @entity9 's style assistants , @entity145 , raced into town to buy ostrich feathers that they attached to the hem			1
@entity9 explains : ' the team and i have 48 hours to prep the outfits before we go into sound check and rehearsal			0
we prep in the fashion hub and bring the outfits to the studios on a friday			0
when we see the outfits on stage , with the lights , staging and choreography , that 's when we can finesse the looks - which can mean adding a small detail through to , in this case with @entity109 , actually making the whole dress in a new colour			1
' ' @entity109 has an exquisite body so creating dresses to fit her shape is a dream , ' said @entity9			1
' we added @entity176 boots to bring the look up - to - date so she could carry off the @entity179 / retro version of @entity180			0
' after the @entity182 , @entity9 and her team pack down the fashion wagon at the studio			0
on monday , they open the hub , return pieces that have been used and tidy and re-stock each contestants ' rail			0
then they are ready for tuesday 's creative meeting and what lies ahead for the next show and the whole process starts all over again			0
quick change : the team used their creative prowess to completely revamp @entity109 's look from a @entity117 dress , right			1
they took a @entity142 cocktail dress and removed the sleeves , deepened the neckline and one of @entity9 's style assistants , @entity145 , raced into town to buy ostrich feathers that they attached to the hem			1

@entity8 followed head stylist @entity9 for the day
she *traipses* around trendiest shops and styles each outfit
