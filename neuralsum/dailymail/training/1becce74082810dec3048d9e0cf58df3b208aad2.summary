scientists have invented the world 's first ultrasound scanner for smartphones , which could revolutionise healthcare in countries where the technology is not widely available			1
the @entity10 scanner plugs straight into smartphones and tablets , providing an instant scan image on the mobile device 's screen ultrasound scans use high frequency sound waves to create an image of body parts to help with diagnoses			1
they are best known for their use during pregnancy to see the baby in the womb but are also used to scan organs such as the heart , lungs , liver , gall bladder and breasts			0
however , ultrasound scanners are usually fairly large , expensive and situated in hospitals and clinics , which could be a long distance away from the people who need them in poorer countries			0
to solve these problems , scientists spent three years developing the @entity10 , which can transmit images over a mobile network or @entity59			1
ultrasound scans ( pictured ) are best known for their use during pregnancy but are also used to scan organs			0
however , ultrasound scanners are usually fairly large and situated in hospitals and clinics , which could be a long distance away from the people who need them the scanner is supplied with its own @entity70 tablet or smartphone , but its inventors are working on versions compatible with @entity73 and @entity75 operating systems			0
the @entity10 costs £ 7,000 compared to £ 60,000 for a full - size ultrasound model			1
@entity77 , ceo of @entity2 creators @entity78 , said : ' ultrasound imaging is safe , effective and can save lives , however more than 70 per cent of the world 's population does not have access to ultrasound because it is expensive and not portable enough			2
' devices like @entity10 enable more care to be provided outside of expensive settings like hospitals into settings that are less expensive , such as clinics and other locations where the patient needs immediate care			2
' this is key to improving access while reducing costs			0
' the @entity10 scanner is supplied with its own @entity70 tablet ( pictured ) or smartphone , but its inventors are working on versions compatible with @entity73 and @entity75 operating systems			1
the portable system costs £ 7,000 compared to £ 60,000 for a full - size ultrasound model he believes accurate and inexpensive diagnostics at the point of care is critical to reducing healthcare costs , while also improving outcomes			1
mr @entity77 said that the @entity10 interface is extremely simple and can be mastered in just a few minutes			0
' @entity10 has built in network connectivity which allows easy sharing of images from the device , for storage as well as for second opinion or remote diagnosis			2
' the device starts in less than a minute and since it is battery powered , it can work off the electric grid			2
' this could be extremely useful in poorer countries where power is limited or unreliable			0
the company said : ' @entity10 fuses the power and wireless connectivity of a smartphone with the internet into a game - changing diagnostic solution that is personal and accessible			0
' the @entity10 interface is simple to use so that nurses , such as the one pictured , can master it quickly			0
the system has built - in network connectivity that allows easy sharing of images from the device for second opinion or remote diagnosis			2
as it is battery powered it can work in areas without reliable power			0

@entity2 scientists who created the device believe its portability and price tag could provide a breakthrough in medical care in third world countries
the £ 7,000 device is battery - powered and can share scan images so nurses can get second opinions and remote diagnoses
