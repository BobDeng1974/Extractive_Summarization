and if the @entity0 are told by @entity4 to unravel their sale and start again , a mighty legal battle will ensue			1
@entity28 , the former @entity29 compliance chief accused of fraud after allegedly obtaining £ 100,000 of unauthorised payments from a family pension scheme , had his case committed to @entity35 @entity34			2
@entity28 , who is held in such high regard in football that he represented sir @entity38 at six @entity29 hearings , claims he was the unwitting victim of a pension scam by a financial adviser who has left the country after being struck off by the @entity43			2

the former @entity54 junior had taken the premature swapping of shirts to a new level by attempting to book @entity47 ’s shirt to exchange before the fourth - round clash			1
@entity52 has contacted former team - mate @entity61 to help out			1
he said before @entity47 was left out of the line - up : ‘ i put my request in early and hope @entity61 can sort it			1
’ @entity50 midfielder @entity52 was keen on getting hold of @entity54 defender @entity47 's shirt @entity69 chief executive @entity68 has tried to justify his rampantly commercial organisation bringing out six @entity72 shirts within 15 months by saying : ‘ we have to have two shirts per season so we have to change kit			1
’ no they do n’t			0
the @entity69 chose to sign the lucrative deal with kit suppliers @entity78 that stipulates two new shirts per season — even in a @entity80 year when two non-branded shirts have to be worn as well			2

@entity99 say no rules are being broken			0
the @entity128 presidential election is becoming yet more of a circus , with volatile @entity131 agent @entity130 , who represents @entity132 and @entity133 , considering joining bookmaker - funded @entity134 on the hustings			0
no wonder @entity128 are having their ethics committee examine the authenticity of the five nominations from national associations required by each candidate			0
@entity130 , pictured with @entity133 , claims he is keen on replacing @entity102 as @entity128 president @entity143 , the former managing director of @entity72 , has bravely agreed , following his @entity29 leaving party this week , to be a guest pundit on 5 @entity147 ’s irreverent quiz show fighting talk on saturday			0
