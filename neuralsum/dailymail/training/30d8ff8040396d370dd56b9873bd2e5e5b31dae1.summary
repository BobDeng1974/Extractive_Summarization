by @entity0 parts of storm - battered @entity3 have suffered the greatest loss of trees in a generation , the @entity1 has said			2
the worst - hit areas have suffered up to 15 storms over the last three months , losing thousands of trees that have stood for decades			1
this winter has been the wettest for 250 years , with a relentless series of vicious storms sweeping in from the @entity15			1
@entity16 in @entity17 lost 400 trees , including this 250 - year - old oak planted by the man who created the landscaped garden winds of up to 40mph have blasted the nation ’s coastlines since december , tearing across the country and creating untold devastation			1
the greatest losses have been among ancient oak , ash and beech trees , experts said , with damage to some woodlands the greatest since the @entity34			1
but given the extent of the wild weather , which hit the western half of @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 particularly badly , losses could have been worse , the @entity1 said			0
the charity has surveyed more than 50 of its sites , with many gardeners , rangers and foresters saying that the losses of trees has been the greatest since 1987			2
@entity49 in @entity50 suffered some of the biggest losses , with more than 500 trees blown over , including 20 that were significant to the estate ’s landscaping			1
a 600 year old oak tree blown over by the storms at @entity59 in @entity60 which @entity61 called ' the greenest valley with the prettiest river in the world ' specimen trees have been badly damaged or blown over in gardens and parks , particularly in south - west @entity39 and @entity40 , but gardens outside the west have also suffered , with @entity70 near @entity71 , @entity72 in @entity60 and @entity73 in @entity74 all affected			1
@entity16 in @entity17 lost 400 trees , including a 250 - year - old oak planted by the man who created the landscaped garden			1
historically important trees have been lost , including a rare black walnut at @entity81 , which was the largest in @entity82			2
@entity83 , the trust ’s nature and wildlife specialist , described the lost ancient trees as ‘ nature ’s cathedrals ’			2
one of the reasons for the extensive damage was the heavy rain which accompanied the storms , he said , creating waterlogged ground and increasing the chance they would be toppled			0
lots of trees have come down on the south of the @entity99 in @entity100 with the south - easterly winds blowing in from the @entity102 mr @entity83 said : ‘ too many old beech , oak and ash trees have been lost			1
these are important habitats , for bats , beetles , flies and fungi , though a whole series of species colonise and utilise them once they fall , and drive the rotting down process			0
‘ people love and need trees , and the loss of specimen trees in gardens and parks , and of ancient beeches and oaks in the woods and wider countryside , hurts us all and damages much wildlife			2
‘ we value and venerate these old sentinels and need to become increasingly aware of the power of the weather			0
‘ increased storminess , and increased extreme weather events generally , are likely to stress trees further , especially veteran trees			0
we will have to think carefully about where we establish trees and what species we plant			0
’ the @entity139 , which looks after 1,000 woodland sites across the country , echoed the @entity1 ’s comments			0
a spokesman said staff are still assessing the extent of the devastation			0
