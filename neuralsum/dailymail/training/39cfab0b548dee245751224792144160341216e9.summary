by @entity0 lucky escape : @entity2 , one , from @entity3 , @entity4 , fell nine feet through the bannisters just as he had learned to walk a baby 's first attempt at walking ended in disaster after he fell through a gap in the bannisters and onto hard tiles on the floor below			1
@entity2 , from @entity3 , @entity4 , was playing in an upstairs bedroom when he decided to take his first steps unaided , two days before his first birthday			1
the stairgate was closed but he stumbled on the landing and plunged straight through a gap in the bannisters , falling nine feet onto the hall floor below			2
@entity2 's parents heard the thud and called an ambulance , which took him to @entity25 where doctors diagnosed a fractured skull			1
after x-rays and a @entity29 , @entity2 was transferred to the neurology department at @entity32 's @entity31 , where he spent two days			1
now , nine days on from the fall , he is back at home with his parents @entity35 , 33 , and @entity37 , 39 , and older brother , @entity38 , five			1
the orbital bone above his left eye is slowly healing , and the only trace of his accident is a slowly fading black eye			1
mrs @entity44 said : ' he 's doing great now and he 's back on his feet , but i really thought we were either going to lose him , or if he survived , he would n't be the same little boy he was before			1
' by some miracle , he 's ok			0
' she said the accident happened on the first day the little boy began to walk unaided			0
' he has been around that area a million times before when he was crawling and there have been no problems , ' she said			0
' when i saw him lying there on the floor , i thought that was it			0
' the accident happened when mrs @entity44 was in the kitchen and her husband , a @entity65 manufacturing worker , was in an upstairs bedroom			1
the family had already checked to make sure the baby could n't fit through the five inch gaps in the bannisters , but did n't realise the one nearest the wall was slightly wider than the rest			2
the @entity73 say there was a towel hanging over the bannister , and believe the baby put his hands out for balance , thinking it was solid , and fell through			0
' i just heard this thud and i screamed , and swooped straight in to pick him up			0
i think it took a couple of seconds for @entity2 to realise what happened and then he started screaming			2
' when i heard the thud and saw him on the floor the towel was with him			0
i just do nâ€™t think he would have been able to get through crawling			0
' she added : ' up until the results of the ct scan came in , we were scared that we were going to lose @entity2			1
it was horrific , but thankfully there was no bleeding on his brain			0
' now we just want to prevent this from happening to anyone else			0
' back at home : the @entity116 now want to warn other parents of the dangers of mobile children and bannisters			2

@entity2 was two days from his first birthday when he started to walk
he *tottered* out of his bedroom and plunged through a gap in the bannisters
@entity128 , @entity44 , 33 , from @entity4 , said she heard a loud thud
she and @entity2 's father , @entity65 worker @entity131 , 39 , called an ambulance
ct scan and x rays showed @entity2 had a fractured skull but no bleeding
now the one - year - old is back at home and fine apart from a big black eye
mrs @entity44 said : ' we checked bannisters but one gap is wider than rest '
