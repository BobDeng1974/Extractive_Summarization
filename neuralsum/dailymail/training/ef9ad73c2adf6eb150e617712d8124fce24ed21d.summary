@entity1 employees past and present with a bone to pick against the company have aired their grievances in an online forum that makes the ' best place to work in tech ' look like just another job			1
employees bemoan the company ’s lack of privacy , hate having to listen to people whine to them about @entity1 , and wonder whether this website they spend so much time with is really worth the screen it ’s displayed on			1
though the @entity22 , @entity21 company was given the designation of best overall tech company to work for by employment site @entity25 , its employee complaints will sound familiar to anyone who ’s ever held a job or simply logged onto the social media site			2
the grind : the reception at @entity1 headquarters in @entity22 , @entity21			0
though the company was recently voted best tech company to work for , employees still complain ' forget the free food and drinks , ' is among the complaints of one @entity40 user in answer to the question ‘ what 's the worst thing about working at @entity1 ? ’ on the q&a website			1
free food , managers who encourage personal expression , and wide open offices are all part of what consistently earns @entity1 ' best place to work ' designations but those same qualities can wear on employees ' nerves			2
' the workplace is awful , ' the employee continued			2
‘ huge rooms filled with rows and rows of picnic style tables with people sitting shoulder - to - shoulder with six inches of separation and zero privacy			0
' @entity67 was a big issue among employees who contributed to the post , something that will come as no surprise to users who 've complained for years of the company 's privacy policies			1
' like cattle ' : employees say the office 's open floor plan offers little privacy at work , a complaint many office workers in any industry can relate to sound familiar ? one employee said @entity1 top brass @entity85 and @entity87 impose a ' holier than thou attitude on everyone and everything around them ' hearing the corporate office mentality reflects the way @entity1 treats its users is hardly a revelation			1
meanwhile , it is hard to feel completely bad for exposed @entity1 employees , where even interns make $ 5,602 per month according to @entity100			0
‘ that 's how you keep cattle in the pen , ’ continued the employee , ‘ not high quality talent earning low to mid six figures			1
’ also , social politics play too big a role for some employees ’ tastes			0
many complain about having to hear people ’s opinions about @entity1 all the time from users just because they work there			0
not even their spouses are immune			0
‘ as a @entity1 spouse , ’ began an employee ’s wife , ‘ i was often asked for help on how to use the privacy settings solely on the basis that , being married to someone who works at @entity1 , i must know			0
’ ' overhyped ' : one employee bemoaned his time working for the company as wasted - with its ' dismal public offering ' and ' realizing the company does n't really have a future ' employees also said attitude issue extends to the top of the company , where ‘ @entity87 and @entity85 , ’ wrote an employee , impose a ‘ holier than thou attitude on everyone and everything around them			1
’ another employee wrote : ‘ the tone of voice people used was belittling and self - righteous			1
' and finally , the much ballyhooed and , for a time , maligned initial public also offering figured into many complaints			0
like users wondering if spending hour after hour on the social media site is a waste of time , so too do some employees fear they ’re wasting their professional lives			0
‘ knowing that you are part of an overhyped public company that was supposed to be valued over $ 200 billion by now , ’ cites another anonymous @entity40 user in list of @entity1 complaints , ‘ but which had a dismal public offering that left many employees feeling totally helpless as they saw the value of their stock collapse			1
’ despite the many issues employees who contributes to the @entity40 post took with @entity1 , most reflected the @entity25 ’s positive take on the company , not least of all its free three meal - per - day perk			2
‘ it 's a truly fantastic place to work , ’ wrote one user			2
another said his top complaint was ‘ that i have but one stomach for all the food			0
