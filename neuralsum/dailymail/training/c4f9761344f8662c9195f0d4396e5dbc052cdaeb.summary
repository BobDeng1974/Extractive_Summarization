by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 16:00 est , 3 may 2013 speaking out : @entity1 said midwives should return to routinely weighing pregnant women to help fight the obesity epidemic midwives should return to routinely weighing pregnant women to help fight the obesity epidemic , a health minister has said			1
@entity1 said it was ‘ absolutely bonkers ’ that the @entity9 had stopped the practice			1
the mother - of - two said women need not feel such weigh - ins were intrusive – and said that she was happy to be weighed when she was pregnant because it helped her ‘ keep an eye on things ’			1
midwives could then use the information to give women advice on eating more healthily and taking more exercise			2
the @entity23 is having to deal with more and more overweight women having children – putting them at increased risk of pregnancy complications			1
there is also a concern fat mothers can pass their obesity on to their children			2
a third of children are now overweight or obese			1
yet despite the risks of harm to mother and baby , the @entity9 stopped routinely weighing pregnant women around the turn of the millennium for fear of stigmatising the obese			1
miss @entity1 , the public health minister , revealed she was looking at the issue of weighing mothers - to - be during a debate on childhood obesity in @entity46			1
she also said she wanted updated advice for new mothers to ensure they are better at feeding their babies rather than putting them at unnecessary risk of obesity			0
obesity puts mothers at risk of high blood pressure and gestational diabetes , which can make pregnancies more dangerous			2
there is a higher risk of early induction and caesarean sections , and a greater threat of pre-eclampsia , which can lead to life - threatening seizures			0
maternal obesity also makes babies more likely to be obese in later life , and it can lead to a range of birth defects such as spina bifida			0
way forward : it is claimed that midwives could use the information from weighing women to give them advice on eating more healthily and taking more exercise			2
this picture is posed by a model the minister ’s call was welcomed by @entity83 , from the @entity84			0
he said : ‘ @entity85 stopped around the beginning of the last @entity88 administration when it was considered the practice was unduly concerning women about their size			0
‘ measuring them frequently was considered to be @entity93 , but what they did was throw the baby out with the bathwater			0
it has fuelled the consequences of obesity , with effects for mothers , babies and huge expense to the @entity9			2
’ the @entity105 however said there was no reason to weigh all women , and that it was usual practice to weigh those who are clearly obese			0
@entity109 , a midwife adviser to the college , said : ‘ we stopped weighing women because it did n’t make much difference in terms of assessing the state of the pregnancy and foetal wellbeing			1
‘ you can visibly see if a woman is getting obese , and there are protocols in place so that sometimes we may need to weigh them			0
’ she added that it was more important to help mothers feed their child healthily .			0

@entity1 said @entity9 should return to weighing pregnant women
@entity9 is dealing with more and more overweight women having children
