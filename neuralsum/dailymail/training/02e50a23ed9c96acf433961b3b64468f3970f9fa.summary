by @entity0 published : 18:07 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 02:28 est , 21 august 2013 the headmaster of @entity2 is calling for @entity3 to be abolished and pupils spared ‘ @entity6 - style ’ public examinations until they are 18			1
@entity7 said he wanted a ‘ loosening ’ up of what is expected of children at 16 to give schools more freedom over what they teach			1
his comments come as around 600,000 pupils across the country await their gcse results tomorrow			2
headmaster of @entity2 @entity7 is heavily critical of the constraints of traditional examining and believes that the system needs to modernise to equip students for the real world mr @entity7 said : ‘ it seems to me we ’re moving to a period when , as a society , we seem to see merit in all , or at least the majority of students , continuing to the age of 18			1
' it rather begs the question why we ’re having a major public examination at the age of 16 in the way we do it			0
‘ i say that because i think there are constraints about a traditional , one might almost say @entity6 , form of examining – sitting on your own at a desk for a given period of time			1
‘ as soon as you go into the world of work , the last thing on the whole you do is sit down on your own without speaking			0
you ’re dealing in teams , you ’re dealing in groups , you ’re sharing things			0
‘ what i ’d like to see is a more inventive approach , a loosening of what we expect at the age of 16 so one could introduce qualifications based on the shared experience of young people			0
personally i ’d be very happy with a system with a robust examination at the age of 18 and more freedom for schools about how they get there			0
’ candidates could face losing up to 5 per cent of the grades for sloppily written papers mr @entity7 highlighted the @entity71 awards , which are awarded at three levels of bronze , silver and gold			1
he said pupils can gain gold awards by working collaboratively in teams of four and learning that ‘ you ’re as good as your weakest member ’			1
he added : ‘ it ’s a tremendous learning experience about collaboratively producing an answer to the problem			2
’ prince @entity85 at @entity2 in 2000 , both he and his brother @entity86 were former pupils of the country 's most prestigious school pupils at @entity2 sit mainly @entity91 – based on the old o - level and regarded as a tougher alternative to gcses – and about half the subjects in the sixth form are @entity97 , which is seen as a return to traditional @entity100 study before it was divided into ‘ bite - sized ’ modules			1
the school has introduced ‘ flipped ’ lessons in some subjects , including @entity105 , which involves pupils going off researching their own work before class			2
mr @entity7 said : ‘ the notion of a school is that you turn up to the lesson , the teacher explains a lot of things in your 40 minutes and you go away and do homework to show you ’ve understood			1
‘ a flipped lesson turns it the other way round			0
the information you would need to have is available online , you ’re set all this in advance and what the lesson then becomes is seeing if you have understood the information and can develop it or manipulate it in creative ways			0
‘ it ’s not a question of every lesson suddenly becoming a flipped lesson			0
but what ’s really good for students is seeing there ’s different ways of going about things			2
that i find rather exciting			0
‘ we ’re developing a whole range of different ways of students learning – a lot of which enables them to take greater control for themselves , more independent learning			2

@entity7 was once himself a pupil at the prestigious school
but he thinks the constraints of ' traditional ' examinations limit pupils ' learning
students at @entity2 already take @entity91 regarded as tougher alternatives to gcses in preparation for *application* to @entity160 and @entity161 *universities*
