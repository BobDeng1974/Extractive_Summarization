judge @entity9 said that both victims of abuse had been terrified			1
abuse : @entity15 who was targeted by trolls on @entity1 after she campaigned for women 's faces to be used on banknotes ' the fact that they were anonymous heightened the fear , ' he said			1
' the victims had no way of knowing how dangerous the people making the threats were , whether they had just come out of prison , or how to recognise and avoid them if they came across them in public			2
' victim : @entity30 mp @entity29 who was also targeted by @entity1 trolls the court heard that university - educated @entity5 has 25 previous convictions , the majority for being drunk and disorderly			1

' he described @entity5 as an ' intelligent and well - educated woman ' with a 2:1 degree in creative advertising , but said her apology appeared ' hollow '			2

' she understands what it must have been like now			0
at the time , it seems , she did not , ' mr @entity97 said			0
' maybe there 's an issue about the technology and @entity1 and people understanding what it must be like on the other end			0

' he believed at that time that there was a conversation and he was engaging in that conversation			0
' mr @entity119 said @entity6 had no particular opinion on the campaign but had seen the topic trending on @entity1 and his lack of experience of social interaction meant he did not know his behaviour was inappropriate			2

in a statement released via @entity1 after the sentencing , ms @entity15 said that she was ' relieved ' the judge had given the pair strong sentences			1
' i did not attend the sentencing as i did n't feel i could cope with being in court with them - and i did n't feel sure that the judge would understand how terrifying and scarring the whole experience has been for me , which again is not something i could face , ' she wrote			0
' i feel immensely relieved that the judge clearly has understood the severity of the impact this abuse has had on me			2
' the damages that have been awarded to me will be going to charity			0
when this has all sunk in i will decide which charity			0
