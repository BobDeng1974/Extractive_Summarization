by @entity0 a week sir @entity1 will probably want to forget might just end with a reminder why the 10 - time champion @entity4 trainer is held in such high esteem			1
becoming embroiled in the spate of positive tests for @entity9 which have hit the sport is hardly the way @entity1 would have chosen to prepare for @entity12 ’s £ 1million @entity14 @entity13 , the midsummer highlight of the flat season			1
especially when one of your two horses involved is the headline - grabbing @entity20 ’ s 2013 @entity24 winner and 2014 runner - up estimate			2
the fact that the blame for the positives appears to lie with a feed manufacturer will hardly have lessened the embarrassment			2
bad week : estimate , trained by sir @entity1 and owned by the @entity20 , tested positive for morphine but the reason the @entity20 turned to @entity1 to train her horses was because of his reputation for patiently and successfully producing champions			1
five winners in the @entity13 , starting with @entity37 1981 , have been sent out from his @entity38 and one more will make @entity1 the most successful trainer in the race ’s history			1
in telescope , the 2 - 1 favourite , @entity1 saddles a @entity46 - ridden colt which has been typically given time to find its feet after injury disrupted its 2013 season and prevented a @entity52 tilt			1
defeat on his first two runs in 2014 did not derail the @entity1 master - plan and when @entity44 streaked seven lengths clear in @entity12 ’s @entity57 his place in this afternoon ’s race was sealed			1
that performance inevitably drew comparisons with @entity1 ’s latest @entity13 winner , @entity61 , owned like @entity44 by @entity62 , who completed the @entity64 - @entity13 double in 2010			2
favourite : sir @entity1 's horse telescope is strong favourite for the @entity13 @entity24 : the @entity20 and her daughter @entity67 greet the horse , estimate @entity70 , racing manager for @entity62 , said : ‘ sir @entity1 has trained him brilliantly to come in his own time			1
‘ we have had late - maturing horses with sir @entity1			1
at this time of year , they find their strength and maturity and start improving in leaps and bounds			0
you just never know how far			0
‘ telescope had a very high profile for a long time			0
it was incredibly public when he did n’t make the @entity52 and there have been a couple of other issues			0
suddenly he got the reputation of being a talking horse			0
‘ but he has never been out of the first two in his life , was impressive when he won last season ’s @entity89 and would run in the @entity91 but got a tiny bone chip in a fetlock joint			0
‘ he developed mentally and really relaxed and switched off through the winter so @entity1 said it was going to take a race or two to get him fit and after he was beaten by @entity96 at @entity97 in may , sir @entity1 said to make sure i told the owners not to lose faith			1
feed : estimate 's positive drug test was a result of horse feed contaminated with morphine ‘ at @entity12 we saw the blossoming telescope			1
in right conditions he is a talented horse			0
’ one of those owners is @entity113 manager sir @entity112 , who might make it to @entity12 after a bug prevented him leaving with his former team on their @entity118 tour earlier this week			2
@entity112 is shrewd enough to know telescope and @entity1 ’s reputation are built into his odds with strong opponents lining up			2
they include @entity126 - trained @entity125 winner @entity129 and @entity128 ’s @entity127 hero @entity124 , who looks a big danger			0
a high temperature has ruled out @entity135 ’s @entity134 hope @entity132 but the heavy showers that fell on the track yesterday turning the going @entity138 have ensured the participation of @entity142 ’s @entity141 winner @entity143			0
@entity142 saddles two other three - year - olds making this the clash of the generations the @entity13 is meant to be			2
they are @entity52 third @entity149 winner @entity148 , who receives a significant 15lb from @entity44			0
a win for any of his trio would be a significant blow in @entity142 ’s attempts to win a second trainers ’ championship .			0

sir @entity1 trains the @entity20 's horse , estimate
estimate tested positive for morphine after consuming contaminated feed
telescope strong favourite for **tomorrow** 's @entity13 at @entity12
a win **tomorrow** would make @entity1 the race 's most successful trainer
