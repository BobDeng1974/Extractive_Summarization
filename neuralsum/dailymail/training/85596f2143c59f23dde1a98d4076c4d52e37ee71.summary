when @entity2 was walking his dog on the beach , the last thing he expected was a three metre crocodile charging at them			1
the 56 - year - old , from @entity8 , north of @entity9 in the @entity10 , took his border collie named ' friday ' on their regular walks along @entity15 beach about 7pm on sunday			1
but after letting friday go for a swim in the water to wash off the sand , mr @entity2 noticed just the eyes of a submerged saltwater crocodile about 30 metres from his dog and moving quickly toward him			1
@entity2 was walking his dog , named friday on a beach when he noticed the crocodile coming at them ‘ i could n’t see what it was so i thought i ’d check it out because it looked like a fish on the surface , ’ he told @entity25			1
‘ they are very smart creatures and it had its whole body submerged the whole time and all you could see were those little eyes coming at you			0
‘ it was coming straight at us really fast and we had to run right off the sand before it spun around and went straight back into the water			2
' mr @entity2 was walking back towards the bridge when he happened to turn around and notice the reptile before other beach goers alerted what they had saw			1
‘ people on the other side of the creek were screaming out : “ watch your dog ! ” , ' he said			0
‘ it happened to stalk us at the time and it would have come from behind us and got the dog			0
if i had n’t seen it , it would ’ve been a whole different story			0
‘ i also warned the fishermen to get off the bank at the time because he was right on the edge of the water			0
' the quick - thinking man noticed the submerged three - metre crocodile moving really quickly towards them from 30 metres away but mr @entity2 said this was n’t the first time the crocodile had ' targeted ' the pair			1
two months ago , he was walking with his wife , daughter and friday , when they had a similar encounter			2
‘ friday was chasing rocks under the water and we made sure he played in the shallow end			0
' just as we started walking back , my daughter said something in the water looked like a croc			2
' we kept an eye on it and it did n't worry us too much but it started following us for a good 200 metres before it stopped and sort of sat there			0
‘ i did go back there after to take the dog for a run and as soon as it saw friday , it made a beeline for him because it obviously wanted the dog - a dog is a bit of a delicacy for the crocs			2
' a three - metre saltwater crocodile was spotted along @entity15 beach in @entity9 on sunday evening mr @entity2 has been a regular @entity15 visitor for 15 years and said the incidents have n’t changed his mind about going back there			1
‘ it does n’t stop me from going back there but i am always alert and aware , ' he said			0
mr @entity2 added : ‘ what worries me are the kids who are playing near the water or new people who do n’t have an understanding of swimming at the beach			1
‘ you need to be aware because they ’re very fast creatures but the odds of taking someone is slim			0
‘ there have been two reports of crocs in the @entity15 area around this time of year but no one has been taken by one – they ’d take a dog before taking anyone else			2
