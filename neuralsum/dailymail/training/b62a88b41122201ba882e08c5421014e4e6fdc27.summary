by @entity0 six years after his daughter was adopted without his knowledge or consent , @entity1 is getting to spend spring break with her			1
mr @entity1 has been fighting for custody of his daughter since before she born , but despite a @entity9 court dismissing the adoption two years ago , the case is still not over			1
when the case went back to a @entity13 court however , the judge ruled that mr @entity1 should share custody with his daughter 's adoptive parents			1
legal fight : @entity1 is pushing for full custody of his daughter after her adoption was dismissed but a judge ruled she should remain with the couple she was given to ' basically , i 've got out - of - state father visitation , ' he told @entity24			1
' i was hoping for sole custody			2
it was a little shocking that they ruled for joint			2
' the danger is they 're ignoring my constitutional rights to my daughter , ' he added			2
' it 's like what they are saying is if a case is in court long enough , the child will probably stay in the new home			0
' one of the problems , through all this fraud and lies is they are given primary care and no attention is paid to how she got [ to be with the adopted family ]			1
it has tainted her relationship with me , her father			0
' the court in @entity13 who ruled for joint custody stated that @entity57 's adoptive family were her ' psychological parents ' because theirs is the only home she has known			1
the process in which @entity57 came to be given away despite mr @entity1 ' requests for custody before she was born , led @entity9 to dismiss the adoption because of fraud			1
the ruling means that mr @entity1 has been forced to appeal the decision , leaving him and his daughter in a legal limbo that keeps them apart			2
currently he has shared parental rights , meaning he is involved with decisions about her life and education , but @entity57 remains living with her adoptive family			1
the confusing case and mr @entity1 fight for the right to bring up his daughter , began when his partner told him she was pregnant and that she wanted to give the baby away			1
even after they separated during her pregnancy , mr @entity1 tried to remain as involved as possible and helped financially			2
questions : @entity1 says as his daughter , @entity57 , gets older it gets harder to explain why she is n't living with her father but , on the same day he filed a paternity petition in a @entity13 court , his ex-girlfriend was signing adoption papers for their daughter in @entity9			1
he only discovered his baby had been born prematurely when a friend called to say his ex-girlfriend had returned to work and was no longer pregnant			0
on the advice of her @entity97 , his ex had been told if she let the little girl be adopted by a @entity100 family she would be accepted back into the church			0
@entity57 was adopted by the woman 's brother - a situation that makes the custody battle even more confusing for the child			0
' it 's very hard on her and had to try to explain who her real family is			0
we tell her we all love her and want to be part of her life , ' mr @entity1 , who is not @entity100 , said			2
' it gets harder and harder as she gets smarter and smarter			0
it will be hard on her to read the public records			0
' he added that the details of the protracted custody battle are all easily available , meaning that as his daughter grows up she will easily be able to find them			0
what will also be hard for her to come to terms with is that her biological mother , who she knows as an aunt , had another child after @entity57 was born , and decided to keep that baby			0
for mr @entity1 however , all that matters is spending as much time as possible with @entity57 , and working to get full custody of her			1
the latest - and hopefully final - appeal has been filed , and supporters of the family are able to make donations to a @entity136 page to help towards the legal costs			0
he is also suing the state of @entity9 and his ex-girlfriend and her family for allowing the adoption to go ahead despite him making it clear that he wanted to raise his own daughter .			0
