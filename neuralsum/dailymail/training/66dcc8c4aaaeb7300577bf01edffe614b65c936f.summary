the website of @entity2 bobsledder @entity1 has been censored by @entity5 's strict @entity4 laws while the @entity6 is in @entity7 for the @entity8			1
the heavy - handed censorship has led to speculation as to whether a recent picture of @entity1 and his teammates posing bare - chested may have fallen foul of president @entity16 's anti-gay laws			2
@entity1 had been using the website to keep fans updated on the team 's preparations for the @entity2 , but when he arrived in @entity7 he found access to it had been barred			1
@entity1 used an online translator to decipher the message and discovered his website had been ' restricted ' because it contained information prohibited by @entity5 law			1
it is believed the ban could be related to a tweet that @entity1 sent on february 6 , that linked to a video mocking @entity5 's homophobic laws			2
he tweeted : ' this is pretty funny ' and linked to a short film made by the @entity47 as part of its keep @entity50 campaign			0
@entity1 had also tweeted a team picture in january , which showed him and his bearded teammates wearing only their underpants			0
error : this @entity5 message , blocking @entity1 ' website says access has been restricted because it is either breaking a law or spreading information prohibited in @entity5 going for gold : kripps with the four - man @entity6 team the bobsledder 's tweets automatically link to the news feed on his website			1
according to the @entity70 , the team picture quickly went viral on social media networks last month , and led the team to be declared ' beards of the week ' by gay blogger @entity73			0
it is not known if @entity5 censors cut access to the website because of its popularity within the gay community , but the country has strict laws governing material it deems to be ' homosexual propaganda '			0
@entity1 told @entity85 the ban was ' pretty crazy '			0
an online translation that he did of the error message showed three possible reasons for the ban			1
denied : @entity1 joked on @entity91 about his website being censored the message said it could be restricted because of a court decision ; a source which spreads information prohibited in the @entity5 federation and law ; or that the website uses information from right holders that it should n't			1
@entity1 took the censorship in good spirits , tweeting : ' looks like my website is censored in @entity5 , haha classic # @entity107 i wonder if there 's a camera in my room			2
