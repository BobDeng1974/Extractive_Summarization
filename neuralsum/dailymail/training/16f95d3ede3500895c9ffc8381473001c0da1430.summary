they are the brutal terrorist organisation that claims religious authority over muslims across the world			2
the @entity6 offshoot is confusingly known by three names : @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity9 – but a terrorism expert says they have got their branding spot on			1
the murderous group , which now has around 50,000 fighters in @entity15 and 30,000 in @entity16 according to august 2014 figures from the @entity18 , until recently used the full arabic name @entity20 fi @entity21 - the @entity9			1
in june , the terror group declared a caliphate - an @entity9 state led by a supreme religious and political leader - and began using the simplified name ' @entity8 '			1
‘ @entity9 is very smartly branding itself as the @entity8 , that ’s how it ’s been able to attract so many followers , ’ dr @entity27 , a @entity28 at @entity29 , told @entity30			1
’ the counter-terrorism expert explained that by using the name @entity8 people believe they are signing up to support a legitimate and organised group			1
‘ they do n’t understand , they think they are going to join a humongous well organised army called @entity9 to give out welfare			1
they think they are joining something like a state with a humanitarian wing			0
‘ but it ’s not like that at all because there are lots of different competing factions within @entity15 … there is the @entity61 … so you get two brothers going over there , both thinking they are fighting for the @entity9 state , but they end up on two different teams shooting each other , killing each other			1
’ news organisations , presidents , prime ministers and other world leaders are currently using a mixture of three different names to reference the organisation which is essentially one movement			1
the name @entity9 – the @entity9 - is used by @entity79 news organisations such as the @entity80 and @entity81			1
fooled : people are joining the @entity8 in @entity15 and @entity16 because they think it is a well ' organised army ' , ' dr @entity27 , a @entity28 at @entity29 , said supporter : the @entity8 has captured swathes of territory in @entity16 and @entity15 and has declared itself an @entity87 and called on factions worldwide to pledge their allegiance mission : the @entity8 are trying to create ' a state that does not recognise the previous borders of @entity16 or @entity15 , ' dr @entity27 said international publications such as @entity95 also use @entity9 and the @entity96 uses a combination of @entity9 and @entity8			1
in a recent report condemning the group , the @entity98 referred to the group as @entity9 and by its original name			2
‘ forces of the @entity9 have committed torture , murder , acts tantamount to enforced disappearance and forced displacement as part of attacks on the civilian population in @entity111 and @entity113 provinces , amounting to crimes against humanity , ’ it said			2
the @entity79 government , including president @entity117 , the @entity118 , and the @entity119 , uses @entity9 which stands for @entity9			2
the group has used this name because it aspires to control what used to be the historic region called the @entity124			0
this area includes @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , and an area in southern @entity132 that includes @entity133			0
however , the @entity8 ’s ambitions are now even wider – it wants to bring much of the @entity136 - inhabited regions of the world under its direct political control			1
the @entity140 government , including prime minister @entity141 , also refers to the group as @entity9			2
beheadings : the @entity8 notoriously kills people by beheading them			2
@entity140 jihadist @entity145 is seen here holding up two severed heads in @entity15 control : the @entity8 flag ( left ) is waved by thousands of supporters in @entity15 and @entity16			0
this map ( right ) shows the areas controlled by the @entity8 in red , the areas claimed by the @entity8 in beige and the rest of @entity16 and @entity15 in pale yellow ‘ there are hundreds of @entity159 fighting with extremist groups such as @entity9 – including at least 60 @entity140 in @entity15 and @entity16 , and about 100 facilitators in @entity140			2
that means we could be confronting more potential home - grown terrorists than ever before , ’ mr @entity141 and attorney general @entity156 said in a joint statement on 26 august			0
similarly the @entity167 government and prime minister @entity168 use @entity9			0
on 27 august , mr @entity168 ’s office issued a statement after the brutal beheading of @entity79 photojournalist @entity172 by the terror group			2
‘ the prime minister has condemned the barbaric and brutal murder of @entity172 by @entity9 ( @entity9 ) in @entity15			0
this will not change our commitment to tackling this appalling organisation and doing everything we can to keep our country safe , ’ it said			0
murdered : @entity79 photojournalist @entity172 was killed by an islamic state terrorist in @entity15			0
the group posted a graphic video of his murder online , nearly two years after he was first kidnapped , in august 2014 destroyed : in this photo people walk through the rubble of a @entity191 mosque after it was destroyed in a bomb attack by militants of the @entity8 , formerly known as the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) in the city of @entity195 , july 23 , 2014 ‘ the situation in @entity16 remains deeply worrying and we condemn the barbaric attacks waged by @entity9 terrorists across the region			1
around 500,000 people are displaced in @entity204 province alone and the @entity98 has now declared the situation as the highest level of humanitarian emergency , ’ it continued			0
dr @entity27 said whether you use @entity9 , @entity9 or @entity8 is neither ‘ here nor there ’ but the fact they are calling themselves an @entity8 is important			1
‘ it is significant because what they are trying to create is a state that does not recognise the previous borders of @entity16 or @entity15			0
to say @entity9 state is to symbolically say “ we have created one state that does not respect the borders ”			1
‘ it ’s about a symbolic state - it also communicates their strategy or end goal of establishing true statehood in the region , which they are never going to get - let them dream , ’ she said			0
dr @entity27 explained that the @entity8 ’s leader - @entity37 – has been presented at a very important time as a rightful @entity38 , the head of state in a @entity87			1
‘ @entity234 is being brought forward as the rightful and true @entity38			0
he claims to have the right lineage , the way he walks and talks are also important for people to pledge allegiance to him			0
‘ that ’s how you create a state - when everyone supports him , ’ she said			0
dr @entity27 said another big difference between @entity6 and other terrorist organisations in the region , compared to @entity8 , is that they never really paid attention to ‘ having a valid and rightful caliph ’			1
‘ none of the leaders ticked all the boxes , ’ she said .			0

world leaders and news organisations are using three different names to reference the terror group which is essentially one movement
counter-terrorism expert dr @entity27 says the @entity8 group is spot on with its branding because it comes across as a ' well organised army '
the group changed its name to ' @entity8 ' in june after declaring a caliphate - an @entity9 state led by a supreme religious and political leader
