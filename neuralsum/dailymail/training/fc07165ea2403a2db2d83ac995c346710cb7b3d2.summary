by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 his union paymasters want him to move to the @entity4			0
and when it came to this group selfie , it seems @entity7 took their wishes too much to heart			2
in fact , his extreme shift in position meant he almost missed out on appearing in the picture snapped by reality tv star @entity14 when he found himself surrounded by luvvies and @entity17 mps at a party fundraiser			1
as they scrambled to get in the frame , the @entity17 leader was shovelled to the rear left of the group and ended up looking like a photobomber trying to muscle in on the act			1
among those more prominent in the huddle were actress @entity29 , artist @entity30 and writer @entity31			1
bizarre : @entity14 last night posted this selfie including @entity7 , @entity30 and @entity33 labour frontbenchers @entity33 , @entity35 and @entity36 also made it , although one high - profile colleague missed out – the figure hidden by @entity43 star @entity41 ’s quiff was reportedly deputy leader @entity44			1
@entity41 took a second picture of himself with mr @entity7 and posted it on @entity47 with the group shot , labelled ‘ my selfie buddies ’			2
in december , he took a selfie with the @entity51 at the @entity52 and refers to the would - be prime minister as his ‘ bezzie ’ , slang for best friend			0
the 23 - year - old , who tweets about vitally important matters such as having a bad hair day , has 2.58million followers on @entity47			0
mr @entity7 , who tweets about @entity62 privatisation and the bedroom tax , has 302,000			2
the group has all the elements - if not the glamour - of the @entity67 's selfie which featured stars including @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71			0
@entity41 took the snap at an event to raise money for mr @entity7 's general election war chest			1
he wrote on @entity47 : ' at # @entity76 drinks reception tonight with my selfie buddies @entity29 and @ @entity80 & gang pic. ' he later tweeted a selfie of himself and mr @entity83 , writing : ' with me and my bezzie @entity7			1
' @entity14 described @entity7 as his ' bezzie ' friend in a later selfie between the two of them the @entity17 is recruiting a senior adviser to bring ‘ fresh ideas ’ to overhauling the leader ’s image			1
as @entity95 's biggest selling broadsheet left - wing newspaper , @entity7 understandably wants to keep the @entity96 on side			1
today he is visited the paper 's north @entity100 , to address their morning conference meeting			0
but staff will have tried to keep today 's edition of its @entity96 supplement from him , headlined : ' can you make this guy less weird ? ' in addition to having ideas about how to improve mr @entity7 ’s ‘ brand strengths ’ , the successful candidate will also need to have experience of dealing with ‘ bad news stories ’			1
but someone obviously thinks that joining the selfie craze is the right way to reverse polls which show four in 10 voters think mr @entity7 is ' weird '			2
while @entity17 has maintained a lead in the polls , mr @entity7 ’s personal ratings have remained poor			1
a @entity122 survey last week showed 41 per cent of people think the @entity17 leader is ‘ weird ’ or ‘ very weird ’			2
the survey for @entity126 , which looked at the public ’s perception of the leaders ’ personalities , also found 36 per cent of the population believe mr @entity7 would have been bullied at school			2
with some opinion polls putting @entity17 ’s lead over the @entity134 at just one point , mr @entity7 has ordered his team to beef up his media operation			1
the @entity17 website is advertising the new role of @entity140 , to be based in the @entity141			0
the new job comes with a £ 44,244.40 salary , and a ‘ fixed sum allowance ’ of £ 971			0
the contract will last only until a month after the general election , due in may 2015			0
this week prince @entity147 became the latest prominent public figure to take a spontaneous self - portrait who tweeted a photograph of himself during an event at @entity153			0
in the photograph prince @entity147 can be seen grinning into his mobile phone camera from the stage , while members of the delegation – dressed demurely in suits – laugh and take their own pictures of him on their phones			0
hollywood star @entity29 pictured leaving the @entity17 event last night prince @entity147 became the latest prominent public figure to take a spontaneous self - portrait who tweeted a photograph of himself during an event at @entity153 spontaneity ? @entity169 @entity168 ( @entity170 ) takes a selfie with @entity173 president @entity172 after presenting a jersey during a ceremony on the @entity176 at the @entity177 in @entity178 , on april 1 , 2014 smiles better : the @entity180 posed for a selfie with a pair of newlyweds during his weekly audience best selfie ever : @entity188 's a-list @entity67 's picture literally broke @entity47 when she uploaded this celebrity laden picture during the ceremony the @entity147 first tweeted from his account , @ @entity192 : ‘ welcome to # pitchatpalace i wish you all a great event , both entrepreneurs and audience ’ , signed off by ‘ @entity197 ’ , indicating the tweet was written by him , rather than a member of staff			1
he then tweeted the selfie , which is somewhat at odds with @entity153 protocol , not least because his other tweet included a picture of a notice which reads ‘ mobile phones are not permitted in the state rooms ’ , with the word ‘ not ’ crossed out with black tape			0
prince @entity147 was hosting the final of his @entity215 competition , which looked for students interested in building their own start - up companies			0
he joins prince @entity218 , the @entity180 , @entity7 , @entity219 , @entity220 and @entity172 who have all taken ‘ selfies ’ on their mobile phones , in the craze sparked by teenage girls on social media .			0
