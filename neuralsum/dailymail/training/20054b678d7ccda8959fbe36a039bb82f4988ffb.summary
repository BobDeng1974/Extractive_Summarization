by @entity0 and @entity1 follow @ @ martinkeown5 @entity2 's @entity0 and @entity1 give their expert match analysis following @entity5 's @entity4 defeat to @entity6			1
@entity7 ... @entity9 's first goal was similar to the one @entity5 conceded to @entity10 on saturday			1
once again , the centre forward pulled off the shoulder of our defender and punished us			0
@entity15 should have been touch - tight in the box			0
instead , he was a few yards off @entity9 , who drifted away			1
@entity9 is always looking to pull off the shoulder and @entity15 just stood still			1
even when i played a charity match against @entity31 18 months ago , he was only interested in the space behind me			0
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
@entity35 ... we can look at the defending , but the pass by @entity24 is brilliant and it takes out five players			1
@entity9 ’s world - class movement beats @entity15 - takes his tally to six goals in six games against the @entity46 man			1
@entity47 and @entity15 were terrorised by the @entity20 striker			1
@entity49 said @entity9 had to score at this @entity4 to prove he is world - class			1
@entity9 proved his point , twice			2
deadly duo : @entity9 celebrates with @entity24 who crossed for the frontman to score the first half was not exactly packed with clear chances - @entity9 ’s goal was the first shot on target			1
@entity35 ... i can understand why @entity5 picked @entity60			2
he had a good season for @entity20 , but he plays in a different position , higher up the pitch , for his club			2
he is deeper for @entity5 and the team were crying out for more dare and creativity			2
i wanted @entity67 or @entity68 on from half - time but @entity68 did not arrive until the 64th minute			0
he had an impact when he came on			0
stretching : @entity5 midfielder @entity60 attempts to get the better of @entity71 too little , too late ? @entity68 made an impact when he came on for @entity5 off the bench @entity6 elated as @entity5 sit on the brink @entity76 's pass completion rate in the game			1
@entity7 ... @entity78 and @entity79 are huge attacking threats for their clubs			0
but they are frustrating for @entity5			2
they were both so conservative in possession in the first half			0
things improved after the break but playing at the highest level has a lot to do with self - esteem			0
different player : @entity78 is dynamic for @entity46 but has failed to reproduce the same form for @entity5 nervy : @entity79 ( right ) and @entity78 were conservative in possession during the first half @entity94 is level with @entity95 on 40 @entity5 goals			1
@entity35 ... it 's not rocket science			0
if you play your best players in their best positions they will do the business for you			0
there ’s been debate all week but playing through the middle @entity94 hit the bar and was clearly our most influential player			0
@entity5 had a poor night but @entity94 answered some of his critics			2
at last : rooney wheels away to celebrate after equalising for @entity5 in the second half hope : @entity94 , pictured celebrating with @entity68 , showed what he 's all about in an @entity5 shirt			1

@entity9 's header puts @entity6 ahead against @entity5
the @entity20 striker *peeled* away from @entity46 defender @entity121 to head the ball into the back of the net
@entity24 *provided* the assist with a *wonderful* *chipped* ball into the box
