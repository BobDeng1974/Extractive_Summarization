on any given night at @entity3 's @entity2 academy , @entity0 may find himself under the watchful eye of @entity6 midfielder @entity5			1
like @entity8 , @entity5 's son , @entity7 , is one of the young hopefuls enrolled at the @entity12 ' @entity11 complex			1
some evenings he may even find himself being put through his paces by @entity7 , who is taking regular sessions with the club 's academy as he completes his coaching badges			2
and then , of course , there 's dad @entity21 , a regular at @entity2 as he keeps tabs on the fledgling careers of his eldest son — as well as @entity26 and @entity27 , who are also on @entity3 's books			1
no pressure then , @entity8			0
@entity8 with sons @entity8 ( left ) , @entity27 ( centre ) and @entity26 ( right ) at the @entity32 last year the teenager has caused quite a stir at @entity3 's youth hq over the past few months			1
at the age of 15 , he was named on the bench for last weekend 's under - 18 clash against @entity39 , raising hopes that he may well have the substance to back up his name			2
@entity8 will discover over the weekend whether his call - up was indicative of a burgeoning career , or merely a generous farewell gesture , with the teenager due to be told whether he is to be retained for next season or released			0
@entity8 's rise through the age groups — having started in the @entity50 — at @entity2 this season has not gone unnoticed by those who are tasked with guiding his career			0
it seems he is modelling his game on @entity21 's , too			1
the descriptions of his playing style are uncanny			1
he plays on the right , but has a tendency to drift into central positions ; he is economical on the ball , makes good runs into the box and is n't afraid to have a shot			0
and to top it all off … he is pretty accurate with a dead ball , too			0
sound familiar ? @entity8 takes one of his trademark free - kicks during his playing days with @entity72 @entity0 is held by his mother , @entity73 , at the @entity74 2013 @entity8 ( right ) plays with brothers @entity27 ( left ) and @entity26 during his father @entity21 's time with @entity78 he is n't the strongest , though			1
his 15 - year - old frame is still slight and there 's a feeling he needs to toughen and bulk up , a problem many young players have			0
it is also said that he could work harder on his defensive duties during matches			0
whether @entity8 is given another year at @entity3 remains to be seen — but what 's for sure is @entity89 will be there to celebrate or commiserate with his son			1
@entity21 has been the driving force — literally — behind @entity8 's career so far			1
schedule permitting , @entity21 will invariably drive his sons to @entity2 for their evening training sessions and saturday matches			1
if he is unavailable , then grandfather @entity98 will step in			0
@entity21 — like all parents — is sent regular email updates with scheduling details for training , matches and meeting times			2
the emails also provide details of regular 10 - minute meetings parents are required to attend to discuss players ' progress			0
@entity21 ensures he regularly attends			2
by all accounts , there are no airs or graces about the @entity0 clan when they 're at @entity2			2
one source said : ' @entity8 is a down - to - earth kid , the other parents like him , too			0
he is a credit to the family			0
you would n't know he was @entity8 's son			0
' devoted dad @entity21 regularly drives his sons to their training sessions and games for @entity3 's youth sides @entity21 and his sons in @entity127 kits ahead of the match with @entity129 in the 2012 @entity130 @entity21 insists on it			1
he knows the value of the @entity134 youth system and wants @entity8 to have the same football upbringing he had			0
there seems a good chance that at least one of the @entity0 brothers will continue the family 's football legacy			2
@entity26 , 12 , has earned rave reviews playing for @entity3 's @entity143 , and scored , in front of his dad , in a 3 - 2 win over @entity147 in a youth tournament on thursday			1
but speak to those in the know at @entity2 and youngest son @entity27 , 10 , has the potential to be the best @entity0 brother			1
@entity0 shirt sales at the @entity156 club shop are set to go through the roof			2
@entity8 drapes a union flag over himself and his sons after winning the @entity130 in 2012			0

@entity0 is currently part of the @entity3 youth academy
his playing style has been likened to that of his father , @entity21
@entity26 and @entity27 are also on the @entity12 ' books
@entity26 *recently* scored for @entity3 's under 15s side against @entity147
@entity21 tries to attend as many of his sons ' games as he can
@entity27 has been tipped to be the most *successful* @entity0 brother
