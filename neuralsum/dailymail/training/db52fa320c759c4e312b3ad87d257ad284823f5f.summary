the world ’s largest solar power plant has gone online in @entity2 , with enough power to supply 160,000 homes			1
spanning a huge 9.5 square miles ( 25 square km ) - a third of the size of @entity8 - the @entity5 consists of nine million solar panels and has a capacity of 550 megawatts			1
and it is a major step towards the state 's goals of supplying 33 per cent of electricity to homes from renewable sources by 2020			0
the $ 2.5bn project spans 9.5 square miles and has nine million panels			1
it has a capacity of 550 megawatts , enough to power 160,000 homes			1
and it will take the place of 370,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions the mammoth $ 2.5 billion ( £ 1.5 billion ) project is located in @entity2 ’s @entity18 , in southeastern @entity28			1
construction began back in 2011 but now , with the installation of the final 40 megawatt segment , it is now the first 500 - plus megawatt solar farm to come online in the @entity34			2
and , at a total of 550 megawatts , it is also the largest solar plant online in the world			1
households in the @entity40 could see their energy bills slashed by £ 425million by the end of the next decade if the government adopts a ‘ stable ’ policy on solar power			0
the @entity46 and @entity47 said that , with the government ’s support , electricity produced by solar panels could become cheaper than the wholesale electricity price by 2024			2
this could result in 18 million homes benefiting from low - cost electricity by 2030			0
the @entity56 , which carried out the study for the @entity58 , also said the solar power industry could contribute £ 25.5billion to the economy and generate 50,000 jobs			0
with prices in the industry having tumbled since 2010 , the report suggests that building solar panel stations could become cheaper than constructing new gas plants by 2018			0
the power it produces takes the place of 377,000 tonnes of co2 emissions annually - equivalent to taking 73,000 cars off the road			2
construction was actually due to finish in early 2015 , so it has been finished ahead of schedule			2
unlike some solar plants , the @entity75 requires no water to generate electricity , and it makes very minimal noise as there are no moving parts			0
each of the solar panels stands just five and a half feet ( 1.7 metres ) off the ground , reducing visible impact from the expansive farm			0
‘ @entity90 projects have a low environmental impact , ’ the company said			0
‘ when in operation , our systems generate electricity with no air emissions , no waste production , no water use , and have the smallest carbon footprint of any photovoltaic technology			0
’ the @entity5 is part of an initiative to make a third of @entity2 ’s electricity come from renewable sources by 2020			2
the plant will ultimately be usurped by another solar farm in the @entity34 next year ; @entity108 ’s @entity107 , also in @entity2 , will be capable of producing 579 megawatts			1
the mammoth $ 2.5 billion ( £ 1.5 billion ) project is located in @entity2 ’s @entity18 , in southeastern @entity28 ( shown on map ) construction of the plant ( shown ) was due for completion in 2015 but finished early			1

construction was due for completion in 2015 but was finished early
but it will lose its status as the world 's largest solar plant next year with the completion of @entity108 ’s @entity107 , which has a capacity of @entity153
