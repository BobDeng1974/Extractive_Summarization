booking a holiday when you can not afford it and driving with a near - empty tank of petrol are the two best ways to live life on the edge , research has shown			1
driving through a red light , buying something frivalous which will take you into your overdraft and crossing the road when the red man is showing are also considered as some of the top ' edgy ' things to do			1
the study , which surveyed 2,000 people , also found that having an alcoholic drink at lunchtime , getting changed without closing the curtains and driving against the arrows in a car park were seen as daring			1
booking a holiday when you do not have the money to pay for it and driving a car on a near - empty tank of petrol are the top two examples of living ' life on the edge ' , according to a survey the research , which was commissioned by @entity34 , also found that 79 per cent of those who took part in the survey wished they had more excitement in their life			1
more than three - quarters said their life lacked excitement , while 46 per cent admitted they would like to be more ' edgy '			1
more than half of @entity45 also admitted they were not very daring , the research found			1
other signs of living life on the edge included driving through an amber light , sitting in a first class carriage on the train when you have a standard ticket and going out on a work night			1
being the last person to board a plan , eating cake for breakfast and consuming food past its sell - by date were also seen as daring			1
other top suggestions from those surveyed included ordering something other than ' your usual ' in a restaurant , leaving your car unlocked or staying up past 11pm on a work night			1
jumping a red light is also seen as a way to be ' edgy ' , according to the survey of 2,000 @entity45 @entity72 , marketing director at @entity34 , which commissioned the research to launch @entity75 pizza , said : ' for some , living on the edge means being a daredevil or doing something risky like bungee jumping or sky - diving			1
' but for everyone else , something as minor as making a change to their usual routine , or doing something they know they should n't be can be seen as ' living on the edge			1
' ' day - to - day , most people will live their life the same as any other day and can often feel like they are stuck in a rut , so even the smallest of risks can make that day more exciting			1
' so while booking a holiday without actually having the means to pay for it may seem quite tame , for many @entity105 , the idea of putting a luxury like that on their credit card is as daring to them as a sky dive is to others			1
