the @entity0 has received a massive shot in the arm with the news that leading @entity5 @entity4 has taken out membership — and he is unlikely to prove the only one			1
@entity8 , who makes his @entity10 debut alongside @entity11 in the first round of the @entity14 @entity13 on thursday morning , revealed he is giving serious consideration to becoming a member as well			1
@entity4 opened the @entity18 season with a win in @entity20 on monday to become only the fifth player in the past quarter - century to win four times in @entity5 before the age of 25			1
the others were @entity11 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			2
@entity4 , posing with his trophy , opened the @entity18 season with a win in @entity20 on monday it is an enormous coup , then , for him to take out tour membership on this side of the @entity35 as well			1
‘ exciting times , ’ the 24 - year - old tweeted , alongside a photograph of his membership badge			0
the last high - profile @entity5 to take out @entity0 membership was former masters champion @entity41 in 2009 , and before him other one - time major winners such as @entity45 champions @entity43 and @entity46 , and @entity49 champions @entity47 and @entity50			1
but @entity4 ’s is arguably a far more exciting development , for not only are all his prime years in front of him , it could also act as a catalyst			2
@entity11 , pictured during the @entity14 pro-am , has finished as runner - up three times in the tournament @entity11 posted a picture with @entity8 ' two best bar men at the @entity61 ' after generations when leading @entity5 were largely content to stay at home , the ambitious @entity4 and the driven @entity8 are keen to sample different cultures and courses to become more complete golfers than is possible simply by playing the largely one - dimensional game required in @entity5			1
@entity68 , the other outstanding @entity5 under the age of 26 , showed a similar willingness when he won the @entity45 in december			1
@entity4 came to prominence on this side of the @entity35 at @entity73 when he was by far and away the top @entity5 at the @entity74			1
two weeks later he returned for the @entity75 in @entity76 — and a love affair was born			0
he made it clear that week he was keen on broadening his horizons , and by taking out membership he has shown how keen			0
@entity11 and @entity8 pose for a promo shoot ahead of the @entity61 on thursday @entity11 ( left ) shakes hands with @entity8 ( right ) after an emphatic 5 & 4 victory at the @entity74 in @entity73 if truth be told , @entity0 membership makes perfect sense for those with ambition			1
given the four majors and the four @entity92 ( @entity92 ) events count , a player just has to compete in five other tournaments to meet the minimum membership requirement			0
he is playing here , the @entity96 and the @entity97			0
if he follows his appearance in the @entity100 event in @entity101 in november by staying to play in the @entity102 , he will be eligible to play in the final event in the race to @entity105 and so fulfil the criteria			0
‘ it ’s definitely something i am thinking about going forward , ’ said the @entity107			0
‘ when you think it ’s only a few more events and if you ’re playing well you can really be part of the race to @entity105 , it ’s definitely a possibility			0
’ exciting times and not just for @entity4 , at the start of the traditional three - week @entity10 swing that signals a new campaign , with all eyes on @entity8 and @entity11 this morning			1
@entity8 pictured during a practice round in @entity14 ahead of the start of the tournament on thursday these two forged something of a burgeoning rivalry last year , and while @entity8 lost out narrowly at @entity123 and the @entity49 and received a fearful walloping in the singles at the @entity74 , he ’s smart enough and good enough to ensure that future trophy presentations are at least tinged with his trademark orange			2
‘ i feel we ’re just at the start of what ’s going to be a lot of fun and some heated battles at times over the rest of our careers , ’ said @entity8			2
‘ we all know how good @entity11 is , and if he gets his driving going like he did last summer , that ’s something i ca n’t match up with as far as distance goes			2
‘ but i do n’t feel like my game is any weaker than his , or anything like that			0
@entity11 held off @entity8 to win the @entity45 ( left ) and the @entity145 ( right ) in 2014 ‘ i ’ve beaten him a couple of times in the past and i believe i will come out on top a few more times in the future			1
’ @entity8 , 26 , finished in the top five in all four majors last year , with the somewhat mixed blessing of becoming the only player ever to achieve that feat without winning one			2
the @entity49 was the one that really hurt , but even there he only bowed the knee owing to some stunning play from @entity11 down the stretch			0
and so it is only right they march stride by stride over the first two days here			0
it might just set the tone for the season .			0

@entity11 edged @entity8 to win 2014 @entity45 and @entity170
