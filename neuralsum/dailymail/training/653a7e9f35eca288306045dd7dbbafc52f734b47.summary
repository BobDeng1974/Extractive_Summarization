@entity0 had her first epileptic seizure in may 2013			1
it was the most frightening and painful experience of her life			0
‘ i ’ve had two children without pain relief and that was a breeze by comparison , ’ says @entity0 , 33			1
the ketogenic diet involves cutting carbohydrate intake to a minimum — no more than an ounce a day			1
patients eat generous amounts of fats , such as olive oil , butter and coconut oils ‘ it was a pain you ca n’t imagine			1
it started in my tongue and i felt impelled to open my jaws as wide as possible			0
' i expelled all the air from my lungs and then i could n’t breathe in			0
’ as well as feeling as if she was suffocating , her body was jerking uncontrollably , then she fell unconscious			0
after that , she had similar seizures every six weeks or so and smaller ones up to ten times a day			1
‘ my jaw would go fuzzy and numb			0
afterwards , i ’d feel tired and get emotional about the smallest thing			0
’ in july , the cause was revealed — a slow - growing brain tumour			1
‘ i was told it might stay in the same state for years , but they would n’t operate because its location meant i might suffer brain damage , ’ says @entity0 , who lives with her husband @entity34 , 35 , a hairdresser , and their children , @entity38 , four , and @entity39 , seven , in @entity40 , @entity41			1
unfortunately , leaving the tumour in place meant it could become aggressive			0
‘ i was told radiotherapy might prolong my life by several years , but only half of patients who develop the aggressive type of tumour are alive a year later			1
’ conventional treatment for brain cancer involves surgery , if possible , and chemotherapy and / or radiotherapy , as well as epilepsy drugs for the seizures — these occur because the tumour presses on surrounding brain cells			1
@entity0 is taking epilepsy drugs , but she believes their effect has been boosted dramatically by following a diet approved to treat children with epilepsy			1
known as the ketogenic diet , it is being used experimentally to help a few adult brain cancer patients control their seizures			1
it ’s thought it might even help tackle cancer			1
many cancer patients switch to a diet high in fruit and vegetables in the belief it can help them fight the disease			1
many cancer patients switch to a diet high in fruit and vegetables in the belief it can help them fight the disease			1
however the evidence for this sort of diet is ' weak ' however , according to professor @entity95 , of @entity97 ’s cancer epidemiology unit , the evidence for this sort of diet is ‘ weak ’			1
but could the ketogenic diet be different ? the radical approach is being investigated at two university brain research centres			1
the diet involves cutting carbohydrate intake to a minimum — no more than an ounce a day			2
out go pasta , rice , sugar , cakes and biscuits ; fruit and vegetables are the main carbohydrates			0
patients eat generous amounts of fats , such as olive oil , butter and coconut oils , and normal amounts of protein — meat , fish and eggs			2
the idea is to keep carbohydrates low enough so the body starts producing ketones as an alternative energy source — these are produced by the liver from body fat			0
this is a natural process and many of us have slightly raised ketone levels before breakfast because we ’ve been fasting through the night			0
they have been found to have a calming effect on the brain			2
indeed , ketogenic therapy is a recognised medical treatment for childhood epilepsy			1
‘ about 30 per cent of epileptic children do n’t respond to drugs			1
' ketogenic therapy is used after randomised trials found 40 per cent of children had a 50 per cent reduction in their seizures , ’ says @entity147 , a dietitian who specialises in ketogenic therapy			1
extensive trials have n’t been done on adults with epilepsy			2
the theory is ‘ almost too good to be true ’ , says biochemist dr @entity152 at @entity153			0
‘ tumours are addicted to a high glucose supply , so a reasonable way to attack them is by cutting carbs , which lowers blood glucose , reducing their energy supply			0
’ what ’s more , the ketones that the body produces to replace glucose as an energy source can be used by healthy cells , but ca n’t be used by cancer cells			2
‘ the ketogenic diet seemed such a plausible way to protect brain cells and starve cancer cells that we had to investigate it , ’ he says			1
a @entity176 study on mice published in the @entity178 found those on a ketogenic diet responded better to radiotherapy than those on a normal diet			1
professor @entity184 , a neuro - oncologist at the @entity185 in @entity186 , led the research			0
patients eat generous amounts of fats , such as olive oil , butter and coconut oils , and normal amounts of protein — meat , fish and eggs ‘ it looks as if the diet can have an effect on the way genes behave — it can help reverse processes that encourage tumour survival , ’ she says			1
it seems to reactivate a system that forces damaged cells to commit suicide			0
a branch of @entity211 in @entity212 — the molecular neuro - oncology laboratory at @entity214 — is also looking into ketones and cancer			2
one of its scientists , dr @entity219 , who studies the biochemistry of the brain , was intrigued by professor @entity184 ’s mice study			2
‘ there is a possibility this diet could change the way tumour genes behave , ’ she says			2
@entity0 has been on a ketogenic diet for a year , helped by the @entity230 , which funds @entity232 dietitians to treat adults whose cancer is causing epilepsy			1
‘ at first , it was challenging , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ you have to cut out so many foods and eating out is almost impossible because everything contains carbohydrates			0
’ a typical breakfast is scrambled eggs and cream while dinner is fish curry with green peppers , coconut and watercress			0
‘ but it ’s made such a difference			0
a month after i started , i felt a big seizure was coming , but it just fizzled out			2
i ’ve had no major ones since and only a fraction of the mini-attacks			0
‘ i ’d been feeling dreadful for two years before the first seizure — i picked up any infection going around and had tonsillitis every six months			2
i used to have a brain fuzziness and that ’s gone			2
' i ’m brighter and more energetic			0
’ she ’s also been told an operation to remove the tumour is now possible because it has shrunk			0
‘ no one is saying the diet did it , but i think it made a difference , ’ she says			2
however , the diet is controversial , not least because it flies in the face of conventional advice			2
dietitians are wary of recommending large amounts of fat , much of it saturated			0
there are also concerns that a high protein intake is unhealthy , with one major study linking it to a raised risk of heart disease			0
but the ketogenic diet used to treat epilepsy has normal levels of protein and high fat			1
@entity287 , professor of physiological biochemistry at @entity97 , believes concern about the safety of increasing ketone levels is based on a misunderstanding			0
‘ the ketone pathway developed as a way to provide animals and humans with energy in times of famine			0
' it ’s only if someone has uncontrolled diabetes that raising your ketone level is dangerous			0
‘ today , people rarely need to switch to ketone production because we are surrounded by cheap carbohydrates			0
' before , many people would be making ketones for much of their lives			0
’ dr @entity152 is leading a study at @entity153 in which healthy volunteers on a low - carb , high - fat diet will be given mri scans to track metabolic changes in the brain			1
‘ we will be able to see the changes in the way cells use energy , ’ says dr @entity319 , a paediatric oncologist involved in the research			0
‘ we can monitor how fats and carbohydrates affect the rate of cell growth			0
’ this is a new direction for cancer research which , for a decade , has been about targeting genes			2
‘ that has n’t been as successful as we hoped because the target keeps moving as cancers keep mutating , ’ says dr @entity319			0
‘ but that ’s not a problem if you can target the energy supply			0
this research could alter the way we think about the role of diet in treating cancer patients			1
’ the hope is to start a trial with human volunteers within a year			0
@entity214 supports brain cancer patients who ask to go on the diet as well as have standard treatment			1
‘ if a patient asks for the ketogenic diet to be part of a package that includes chemotherapy and radiotherapy , we will involve a dietitian to help them , ’ says consultant oncologist dr @entity353			1
@entity363 has been cautious about possible benefits of any diets on cancer			2
however , professor @entity95 , its scientific adviser , says the ketogenic diet research is ‘ very interesting ’ and he ‘ looks forward to the results ’			1
