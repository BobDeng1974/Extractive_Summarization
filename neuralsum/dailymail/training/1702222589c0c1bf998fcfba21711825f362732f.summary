by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ aside from a penchant for nuclear testing , @entity4 and @entity5 share one rather peculiar statistic in common , still standing as the only two nations that @entity8 has scored against at the @entity9			1
in 2006 against @entity4 , it was a penalty kick			2
in 2010 against @entity5 , it was the sixth goal in a 7 - 0 win for @entity13			1
for a player who many hail as the greatest of his generation , @entity8 ’s @entity9 record stands out as a troublesome blot on his copybook			1
two goals in 12 @entity9 appearances for @entity8 , neither of them decisive , stands as one of the inexplicable enigmas of the modern game			2
scroll down to see @entity8 carry @entity13 through qualifying despair : @entity8 's record at the @entity9 finals is a blot on his copybook cut : @entity8 sports his new mop style in training for @entity13 ahead of their @entity34 clash double : he only has two goals at @entity38 , one of which was a penalty against @entity4 in 2006 poor : @entity8 's only other goal came in 2010 - it was the sixth in a 7 - 0 win over @entity5 in @entity44 , @entity8 has had his moments , the highlight that majestic , curling cross to create a last - minute equaliser against the @entity49 but such has been the quality of this glorious @entity9 , it is just one of a gallery of breath - taking snapshots			1
@entity8 is just one comet in a galaxy of superstars , his contribution no greater than @entity58 of @entity59 or @entity60 of @entity61 , perhaps even less			0
more acutely , it will not have escaped the @entity65 captain ’s attention that his old friend @entity66 is producing perhaps his best performances yet in an @entity69 shirt , striking four goals in the group stages to @entity8 ’s none			2
on the world ’s greatest stage , the world ’s greatest player has been lowered into the realm of the mortals , offering only fleeting glimpses of the inspiration that saw him reclaim the @entity82 from @entity66			2
it will rankle that the column inches , the social media chatter and the radio phone - ins are pitting @entity66 against the @entity44 sensation @entity87 , arching away from the @entity8 - @entity66 narrative that has captivated football supporters worldwide for so many years			1
@entity90 : ronaldo baptism of fire : @entity8 could not influence @entity13 's 4 - 0 defeat to @entity94 in his @entity9 opener hopes : @entity8 held the aspirations of a nations on his shoulders for this @entity9 and is yet to deliver this has , it must be said , been a month of complications and frustration for @entity8			1
there is medical mitigation for his struggles			0
a physical phenomenon all season long for @entity107 , @entity8 has now been hampered by injury issues , limping out of training and constantly applying ice to relieve the pain			0
one @entity113 newspaper went as far as to suggest that the 29 - year - old had been told by doctors that @entity8 was risking his career by playing with the recurring knee injury which is causing so much angst			2
a @entity65 publication denied it but the white bandage strapped around his left knee is more than decoration			0
against @entity34 on thursday evening , with @entity13 facing a must - win ninety minutes and relying on improbable favours from elsewhere , it is not unfeasible that this could be @entity8 ’s last involvement at the world ’s elite competition			1
in @entity130 in 2018 , he will be 33			0
will he still possess that blistering pace ? does he have the desire to toil on with this lamentable @entity13 squad into his mid-thirties ? taking a breather : @entity8 's only real contribution so far has been a remarkable assist against @entity49 swansong ? @entity8 is 29 and will be 33 by the time of the next @entity9 so may not feature ‘ maybe we are an average team , ’ @entity8 commented on sunday evening , in a frank and damning assessment of a group that appears to rely almost exclusively on his talents			1
if it was not for @entity8 ’s display of individual wonder against @entity148 in the play - offs , they simply would not be in @entity44			0
the deference , though , approaches almost spiritual levels , with @entity13 looking to @entity8 on every occasion in the final third			0
it is a familiar tale as @entity8 falls into that old trap , offering grimaces of dismay to the exasperating @entity159 winger @entity158 and attempting to rectify his team ’s limitations by doing it all by himself			0
the preening peacock ’s feathers have re-emerged , with @entity8 almost too desperate to impress , too eager to make his statement before the global audience			0
@entity167 's best : @entity8 won the @entity82 in january but has yet to impress at the @entity9 @entity168 : the brightest stars at this @entity9 have been @entity69 's @entity66 ( left ) and @entity44 's @entity87 off target : @entity8 has tried to score this @entity9 but has been unable to find the back of the net it seems churlish to criticise this outstanding talent , who has hit numbers in excess of fifty goals each season for the last four years for club and country , yet some will wonder – particularly in his own country – why @entity8 ’s brilliance is yet to be transplanted onto the grandest stage			1
@entity8 will privately wonder the same and in @entity186 this evening , he may be entering his final opportunity to receive the adoration he craves so much on the global stage			0
stars : @entity8 is yet to light up the @entity9 like @entity44 's @entity87 or @entity69 's @entity66 centre of attention : @entity158 hugs team - mate @entity193 as @entity8 ( third from left ) looks on			1

@entity8 has only scored twice at the @entity9 during his career
his first goal was a penalty against @entity4 in 2006
he also scored @entity13 's sixth in a 7 - 0 win over @entity5 in 2010
@entity87 and @entity66 are *outshining* him on the world stage
his @entity9 record is a blot on an otherwise impressive copybook
