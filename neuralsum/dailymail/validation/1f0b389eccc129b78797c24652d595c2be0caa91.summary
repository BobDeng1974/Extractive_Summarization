he recalled that while none of the dishes he had that night tasted ‘ spoiled ’ per se , he noticed that nearly all of the food was barely lukewarm			0
‘ i was disappointed with the overall quality of the food , but i did not give it too much thought because i was there to support the terrific law school organization hosting the event , ’ mr @entity117 wrote to @entity118			2
