the @entity0 have slammed the @entity2 's ' extremely disappointing ' decision to schedule the club 's @entity4 third - round tie away at @entity6 for a monday night - and have also accused the governing body of ' damaging the magic of the cup '			1
the match has been scheduled for 7.45pm on monday , january 5 , meaning that the only way supporters can return to @entity13 is by taking a bus which arrives back at @entity15 at 4am			1
train travel back to @entity13 from @entity17 is not a viable option because fans would be forced to leave at half - time to ensure they made it in time			1
@entity0 fans will only be able to return from facing @entity6 at @entity17 in the @entity4 third round on a monday night via a coach that gets back to @entity15 at 4am and in a statement on their website ( which can read below in full ) , the @entity0 have reacted in frustration to both the @entity2 's scheduling and @entity31 ' inability to provide a chartered train that could have been financed through the @entity33			1
the @entity0 claim that it is their ' understanding ' that both @entity36 and @entity6 were willing to play on sunday , january 4 - despite this being just three days after @entity0 host @entity37 at @entity15 and @entity6 play @entity39 at @entity40 - but that the @entity2 have scheduled it for the monday instead			1
in a final pay - off to the statement , the @entity0 said : ' we will continue to press for answers from the @entity45 and the @entity2 , and have made the point to @entity36 that fuller explanations of decisions would help the relationship with fans			1
' once again , the football authorities ' actions make the fine words about giving the fans more consideration appear little more than lip service			1
we await answers to our questions from the @entity2 and the @entity45			2
and we will update supporters further when we receive them			2
' @entity60 celebrates putting @entity36 2 - 0 up against @entity39 on wednesday evening ' the scheduling of the @entity4 third round tie away at @entity6 has , understandably , prompted protests from @entity36 fans			1
our supporters are faced with a long trip on the evening of , what will be for many , the first working day of the year			2
the last scheduled train leaves @entity6 for @entity13 at half time			1
and those travelling by coach will need to find their own way back from @entity15 at 4am in the morning			1
' @entity0 made clear its response to the scheduling of the tie			1
since then , we have been in conversation with @entity36 and the football authorities to find out why the tie was scheduled at the most inconvenient time for @entity36 supporters , and what could be done to mitigate that inconvenience			0
there has been lots of rumour and speculation since the announcement was made and , as always , we 've tried to establish the facts before making comment			0
questions are still outstanding but we feel supporters deserve to be updated , so this is the situation as we currently understand it			0
we appreciate the patience of the many fans who have contacted us on this matter			2
' we understand the scheduling of fixtures over the holiday period presented challenges , especially with @entity36 playing at home to @entity37 on 1 jan. in previous conversations with the @entity2 and the @entity103 we have , alongside other fan organisations , frequently questioned the way the scheduling of live games impacts upon fans , and this is a prime example of the problem			1
we appreciate , too , that the playing and coaching staff must ensure there is appropriate recovery time between games			0
but scheduling the game on sunday 4 january would have meant the game was played three days after the @entity37 match , and at a time when it would have easier for travelling supporters to attend			1
' our understanding is that both @entity6 and @entity36 were happy for the game to go ahead on 4 january			1
but , as the @entity124 's statement said , there were " police and stewarding issues " that meant sunday was not possible			0
we have asked the club to clarify what those issues were			0
we have yet to receive a reply			0
we have also contacted @entity45 to ask what those issues were			0
we have yet to receive a reply			0
' the possibility of a cup tie between @entity135 and @entity136 on the 4 january has been mentioned frequently as a possible reason why the @entity6 v @entity36 tie could not go ahead on that day			1
we have asked @entity45 if it is true that they did not have the resources to deal with two football matches in the same county on the same day			0
we have yet to receive a reply			0
' in the event , @entity135 were knocked out of the cup , meaning there will be no match at @entity135 on 4 jan. the @entity149 v @entity135 game was played on the evening that the date of the @entity6 v @entity36 tie was finally announced			1
it 's possible this is because the @entity2 insisted a decision was made on that morning , rather than waiting until the outcome of the @entity135 tie was known			2
we have asked the @entity2 if this was the case			0
we have yet to receive a reply			0
' if the scheduling of the tie for 5 @entity161 was as a result of the @entity2 's insistence that a decision was made before the outcome of the @entity135 tie , we would find that extremely disappointing			1
in numerous discussions with the @entity2 , we have made the point about the effect of kick - off schedules on fans , and the @entity2 has promised to bear this in mind in order to preserve ' the magic of the cup '			1
the @entity2 also acknowledged that playing ties after the draw for the next round has been made damages the ' magic of the cup '			1
and yet this is the situation that we will be in again this year , possibly as a direct result of the @entity2 's action			0
' after making clear our objections to the scheduling of the tie , we also sought to find the best possible solution for fans who did want to travel			1
we asked for the possibility of chartering a train , paid for from the @entity33 , to be looked into			0
this train would have taken six hours each way to ferry supporters to and from the game at a cost approaching £ 40,000			0
@entity31 were also unable and unwilling to provide rolling stock			0
we asked for the possibility of air travel to be looked at			0
this would have cost a six - figure sum to take just 120 fans to the game			2
' so we are stuck with coach travel , taking at least a day 's leave , and significant onward travel difficulties			2
after securing our full allocation , after being denied this for last year 's third round tie , and securing a price of £ 20 for tickets , we had hoped to announce some positive news about this tie			2
but the timing issue has largely negated that			0
' we will continue to press for answers from the @entity45 and the @entity2 , and have made the point to @entity36 that fuller explanations of decisions would help the relationship with fans			2
' once again , the football authorities ' actions make the fine words about giving the fans more consideration appear little more than lip service			2
we await answers to our questions from the @entity2 and the @entity45			0
and we will update supporters further when we receive them			0

@entity0 face @entity6 at @entity17 on monday , january 5 at 7.45pm in the @entity4 third round
away fans will only be able to return home via coach that gets back at 4am
the @entity0 have slammed the scheduling
they say it is a ' disappointing decision ' that ' damages magic of the cup '
