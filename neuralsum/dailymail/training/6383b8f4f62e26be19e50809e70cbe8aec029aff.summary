@entity0 today promised to take a ' tough approach ' on negotiations with insurers over homes in danger of flooding as pictures emerged of its devastating effects in a town that has already been hit once this year			1
residents in @entity11 are once again counting the cost of being hit by flooding from the @entity14 and its tributaries following heavy rainfall - and it 's just five years since the town was home to similar watery scenes			1
as a result people in the town could face excess on their damage claims of £ 20,000 as well as a rise in their insurance premium but the prime minister has said he will come down hard on insurers who fail to provide affordable cover			1
in 2007 @entity31 became a symbol of the town 's plight as water crept ever closer to its foundations and now it looks like the town is suffering from the same fate			1
as this is the third time that the town has witnessed such flooding insurers will once again facing picking up the bill for damage done to many buildings			1
in turn it is likely that home and business owners will face a rise in the amount they pay for their interest and , more worryingly , a rise in the amount they pay for their excess			1
in 2007 a couple in @entity94 , @entity95 , had their house flooded twice in the same summer			2
@entity97 and @entity98 were told their insurance excess would be £ 20,000 after a 4ft wave of water washed across the road through their home			1
the six - bedroom detached house suffered hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of flood damage to the kitchen , living room and study			2
at the time mr @entity112 , 53 , said @entity113 dealt with them efficiently but when he went to renew his home insurance a year later his premium jumped from £ 1,000 to £ 1,638			1
then in 2009 it more than doubled to £ 3,747			2
initially @entity113 said their excess would be £ 20,000 but once he complained it was lowered to £ 10,000			1
here to help : rescue services , visited by mr @entity0 , have been working together to tackle the flooding that has hit the area the pm attended a @entity126 meeting at @entity127 to see how they have been working to tackle the flooding prime minister @entity0 meets staff at @entity131 , @entity132 , who are dealing with the flooding although the devastation is not yet as bad as that seen in 2007 , these pictures show why insurers ask residents for a £ 20,000 excess flooding can be seen stretching for miles away from @entity11 after heavy downpours broke the banks of the @entity14 there is hope , however , after prime minister @entity0 today promised to take a ' tough approach ' on negotiations with insurers over homes in danger of flooding			1
up to 200,000 high risk properties are at risk of being priced out of affordable cover when a deal struck in 2000 between the then @entity157 government and insurers ends next summer			0
the government has been in talks for two years but as yet an agreement has not been reached			0
' i 'm sure we will do a deal , ' mr @entity0 said			0
' we are in negotiations at the moment			0
' we need to take a tough approach frankly and it 's important insurance companies do what they are meant to , which is provide insurance to households and we are going to make sure that happens			2
' mr @entity0 said he was determined to reach an agreement			0
' i am personally involved , ' he said			0
' ( cabinet office minister ) @entity177 is doing this negotiation on my behalf			0
the current situation we have lasts until the middle of next year and we have some time to sort it out			2
' but i want to get it sorted			0
i 've seen myself in my own constituency the difficulty people have when they ca n't get insurance			2
it 's not just it makes them feel unsafe in their own home but they ca n't sell their own home , so it 's very important we get this sorted on their behalf			0
' @entity0 speaks with @entity199 in @entity200 , near @entity201 , as she tells him how quickly the floods rose inside her house hedgerows are the only sign that this is flooded farmland and not a huge lake @entity0 has vowed to get tough on insurers who charge people too much for cover for when they are flooded mr @entity0 was speaking after he met householders in the village of @entity200 , @entity215 , which was struck by flash flooding at the weekend			1
' it is obviously very traumatic when communities are hit by flooding like this but what i found are people are incredibly steadfast and have behaved incredibly bravely at handling the flood and now we need to help them with the recovery , ' he said			1
' we have to make sure their insurance pays out , make sure the @entity228 puts in place good flood defences , make sure there are better warning schemes			2
there are always lessons to learn and i wanted to come here and hear it for myself			0
' mr @entity0 also visited recently - built flood defences on the @entity238 , which have helped protect the local area from worse flooding			0
the prime minister defended his government ’s record on providing flood defences despite a cut in the budget			0
' we are spending over £ 2 billion on flood defences over the current four - year period , which is 6 % less than was spent over the last four years , ' he said			1
' but as well as that , we are actually encouraging private and other money into flood defences and making sure they are more efficient as we build them			0
' i am quite convinced we are going to provide flood defences for another extra 145,000 homes over the period ahead and that ’s very important			0
' flooding : a caravan park at @entity260 between @entity11 and @entity261 surrounded by flood water as the @entity14 burst its banks			1
@entity266 's @entity265 ground was left resembling a boating lake after waters poured into the stadium flood water surrounds @entity271 in @entity272 , @entity127 after becoming marooned in the floodwaters @entity261 racecourse is unlikely to have many races planned over the coming days after floodwater turned it into a lake the @entity261 bypass is just about high enough to stay above the water following the flooding along the @entity14			0

homeowners could face £ 20,000 excess on future insurance claims as a result of being repeatedly hit by floods
