by @entity0 published : 20:08 est , 12 february 2013 updated : 20:32 est , 12 february 2013 worrying : lung cancer deaths in @entity3 women outnumber those from breast cancer and will continue rising for the rest of the decade , warn researchers			1
smoking has been blamed for the predicted increase lung cancer deaths in @entity3 women outnumber those from breast cancer and will continue rising for the rest of the decade , warn researchers			1
at a time when death rates from other cancers are falling , an international survey shows lung cancer is the biggest killer in the @entity3 , which has the highest rate in @entity19			1
figures published today predict a rising number of cancer deaths across 27 countries in @entity19 , reaching 1.3million in 2013 , although the rate of deaths per head of population is actually declining			0
a group of researchers from @entity30 and @entity31 estimate that , compared with 2009 , the overall level of cancer deaths has fallen 6 per cent among men and 4 per cent in women			0
experts say advances in treatment and management are responsible for falling death rates in almost every form of the disease , except for lung cancer in women			2
it will continue rising because women took up smoking later in the 20th century than men , which means cancer develops later			1
in the @entity3 , lung cancer is the biggest cause of cancer death in women claiming almost 16,000 lives a year compared with 12,000 from breast cancer , and the rest of @entity19 is catching up			1
lung cancer deaths have risen by 7 per cent among women in @entity19 since 2009 , says the study published in the cancer journal @entity61			2
one of the study ’s authors , professor @entity64 , head of the @entity66 at the @entity67 and professor at the @entity69 , @entity70 , said : ‘ if these opposite trends in breast and lung cancer rates continue , then in 2015 lung cancer is going to become the first cause of cancer mortality in @entity19			2
‘ this is already true in the @entity3 and @entity78 , the two countries with the highest rates : 21.2 and 17.5 per 100,000 women respectively			0
' this predicted rise of female lung cancer in the @entity3 may reflect the increased prevalence of young women starting smoking in the late 1960s and 1970s , possibly due to changing socio - cultural attitudes at that time			1
‘ however , fewer young women nowadays in the @entity3 and elsewhere in @entity19 are smoking and , therefore , deaths from lung cancer may start to level off after 2020 at around 15 per 100,000 women			1
’ deaths from breast cancer have been declining steadily , with a 7 per cent fall in rates since 2009 in the @entity95			0
killer : in the @entity3 , lung cancer is the biggest cause of cancer death in women claiming almost 16,000 lives a year			1
this is a file picture although lung cancer is still the main cause of cancer death among men , with 187,000 deaths predicted for 2013 , giving a death rate of 37.2 per 100,000 men , this represents a 6 per cent fall since 2009			2
dr @entity112 , chief executive of the @entity113 , said : ‘ the prediction that lung cancer will overtake breast cancer as the main cause of death among @entity19 women is a real concern			0
‘ if we are to avoid such statistics remaining with us well into the 21st century , we will need to continue pushing for tobacco control measures such as standardised packaging for cigarettes and a ban on point of sale			0
’ @entity128 , of @entity129 , said : ‘ it ’s encouraging that breast cancer mortality rates in the @entity3 and across @entity19 are falling			0
‘ however , we must not become complacent as there is still more vital work to be done			0
‘ we need to dedicate more research into the prevention and treatment of these diseases to save more lives in the future			0

@entity145 will continue rising because women took up smoking later than men
