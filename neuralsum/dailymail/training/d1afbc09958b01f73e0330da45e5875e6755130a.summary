mr @entity1 , an ally of former chief whip @entity8 , said revelations around the @entity11 scandal showed chief constables had failed to properly investigate their own juniors - and misconduct should be ‘ taken out of their hands ’			1
his comments came as the @entity18 said it would re-open its probe into a now infamous meeting between mr @entity8 and three @entity22 representatives in october last year			1
the three officers met mr @entity8 amid furore over claims he had called police officers ‘ f * * * * * * plebs ’ after they refused to let him cycle his bike through the @entity30 gates			1
the fallout from the incident resulted in his resignation a month later			0
following the meeting , the three officers , sergeant @entity37 , detective sergeant @entity38 and inspector @entity39 told the media mr @entity8 had ‘ refused to elaborate ’ on what happened during the altercation			1
a secret recording of the meeting , made by mr @entity8 , showed he had provided a detailed account of what happened , but a misconduct probe cleared the three officers of lying			1
yesterday a report by @entity52 said the evidence the three officers had provided to them at a public hearing last month was ‘ misleading , possibly deliberately so , and lacking in credibility ’			0
their accounts were ‘ contradictory , inconsistent and provided little or no insight into their actions ’ , the @entity59 concluded			0
the committee has told two of the officers , @entity64 and det sgt @entity38 that they must appear before it again tomorrow and apologise or be in contempt of @entity68			0
at the same time , the @entity18 said it would reopen its investigation into the meeting with mr @entity8 , after it found ‘ procedural irregularities ’ in how the police handled it			1
mr @entity1 said it was ‘ astonishing ’ and ‘ deplorable ’ that three chief constables had been prepared to ignore clear evidence more junior officers had not told the truth about a meeting with mr @entity8 at the height of the scandal			1
when they appeared before the committee , the chief constable @entity81 of @entity82 , @entity84 chief @entity83 and @entity85 from the @entity87 force all apologised to mr @entity8			1
but only mr @entity83 said he thought the disciplinary probe should be reopened			2
mps on the committee said the officers had shown ‘ an absence of leadership ’ over the affair			2
mr @entity1 told the @entity97 : ‘ truth is central to the judicial system so you expect the police to abide by that			1
’ the recording of the meeting proved that the three officers ‘ were n’t telling the truth , ‘ he said , and given that , it was ‘ really worrying ’ that disciplinary action had not been taken			2
he added : ‘ for the chief constables of three important police forces to let it go is astonishing			1
i ’m afraid it shows you can not trust the @entity113 at all to do this			0
‘ all complaints above a relatively trivial level should go to the @entity18 and they should be equipped to carry them out , including the disciplinary hearings			2
‘ what we need is a core of untouchables to investigate anyone without fear or favour			0
that way the bad apples in the police will not be able to bring the others in to disrepute			0
‘ this will be welcomed by the vast majority of officers who are probably very unhappy about this			0
’ ex-conservative chairman mr @entity1 , an ally of former chief whip @entity8 ( pictured ) , said revelations around the @entity11 scandal showed chief constables had failed to properly investigate their own juniors the scathing report by the committee accused the three @entity22 officers of ‘ obstructing the truth ’ when they appeared before its mps last month			1
it said : ‘ if evidence was given in a similar manner by three serving police officers to a court of law it is our view that such testimony would undermine a case and lead a jury to reach an unfavourable conclusion as to the credibility of the evidence given by those police officers			0
’ it criticised det sgt @entity38 for referring to home secretary @entity162 as ‘ that woman ’ at the meeting , before claiming he was misquoted			0
@entity18 deputy chairman @entity165 said there were ‘ procedural irregularities ’ between the production of a draft version of the disciplinary report and a final version that warranted further investigation			2
miss @entity165 said the @entity18 would conduct the investigation itself so public confidence was not eroded further			2
@entity59 chairman @entity175 said : ‘ the narrative of what we have seen could rival any great work of fiction			0
‘ at every point and at every level , instead of being transparent , we have uncovered a process that obstructs the truth			0
if this can happen to a cabinet minister , what hope is there for anyone else ? ’			0
