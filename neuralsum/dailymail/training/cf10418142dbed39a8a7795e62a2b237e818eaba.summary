by @entity0 at least 1,000 hospital patients in @entity2 die each month from avoidable kidney problems , according to a new study commissioned by the @entity5			2
researchers found that acute kidney injury ( @entity8 ) causes between 15,000 and 40,000 excess deaths every year			1
the condition refers to a loss of kidney function and can develop very quickly			1
danger : thousands of patients are dying from acute kidney injury each month - something which could be avoided , experts have warned it can occur in people who are already ill with conditions such as heart failure or diabetes , and those admitted to hospital with infections			1
@entity8 can also develop after major surgery , such as some kinds of heart surgery , because the kidneys can be deprived of normal blood flow during the procedure			2
severe dehydration is one of the main causes of the condition			1
@entity8 costs the health service over £ 1 billion every year and is responsible for nearly eight times as many deaths as superbug @entity39 at its peak , according to a study commissioned by @entity43			1
the research , carried out by kidney disease experts and @entity46 , found that @entity8 is five times more prevalent in @entity2 hospitals than previously thought			1
severe dehydration is one of the main causes of acute kidney injury report co-author professor @entity52 , consultant renal physician at @entity53 , said : ' we know that at least a thousand people a month are dying in hospital from @entity8 due to poor care			1
' these deaths are avoidable			0
this is completely unacceptable and we ca n't allow it to continue			0
good basic care would save these lives and save millions of pounds for the @entity5			0
' doctors and nurses need to make elementary checks to prevent @entity8			2
in general , people who are having surgery should n't be asked to go without water for longer than two hours			0
' sometimes that is unavoidable but then medical staff need to check their patients are not becoming dehydrated			0
they also need to be aware that some common medications increase the risk of @entity8			2
' @entity75 , health economist at @entity46 , said : ' @entity8 costs the @entity5 more than £ 1 billion every year			1
that 's more than we spend on breast , lung and bowel cancer combined			0
' every day more than 30 people are dying needlessly			0
compare that to @entity39 which was killing about four people a day at its peak			0
' simple improvements in basic care could save the @entity5 £ 200 million pounds a year and , more importantly , save thousands of lives			0

acute kidney injury ( @entity8 ) causes up to 40,000 excess deaths every year
