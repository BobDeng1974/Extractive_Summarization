by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 if @entity4 spent much of their pre-match @entity5 obsessing about the centre forward they may or may not face in @entity7 on thursday , all of a sudden there is another goalscorer looming on the horizon with something to prove			1
@entity11 and @entity12 were always expected to provide @entity14 ’s team with something of a test this summer			1
providing @entity11 proves his fitness , @entity4 will deal with that particular obstacle on thursday			2
around the corner , however , await @entity20 and their young striker @entity21			1
video : scroll down to see @entity24 youngster @entity21 score a screamer rising star : @entity21 has caught the eye for @entity20 sharp - shooter : @entity21 was on target in the 3 - 1 win against @entity12 opening his account : @entity21 helped @entity20 cause a @entity5 shock a goal from the 20 - year - old @entity24 forward helped @entity20 shock @entity12 with a 3 - 1 win in @entity36 on saturday and those closest to him have predicted more of the same when the central @entity39 nation meet @entity4 in @entity40 next week			1
@entity21 ’s father @entity41 told @entity42 : ' i expect and want to make it known that i have told him this has to be the game for him			1
' when he played against @entity48 [ for @entity49 in the @entity50 last season ] i told him that it had to be the game to shine , to show the world what he can do			1
' he has the football to show in @entity4 and this is the time for him to prove it to everybody			1
i have told him this and that is what he is going to do			2
what he did against @entity12 , it was incredible			1
' i knew he was going to score or do something exceptional , like he did for the third goal			2
i knew it would happen			0
' @entity21 has been an @entity24 player for three years but has spent all of that time out on loan , first at @entity72 in @entity73 and then in @entity74 with @entity49			1
having scored the second goal in @entity49 ’s defeat of @entity48 in @entity78 last season , the 20 - year - old made a small dent on the public consciousness back in @entity4			1
making a name for himself : @entity21 scored against @entity48 in the @entity50 for @entity49 last season learning curve : @entity21 has progressed during his loan spell in @entity74 his performance in @entity87 at the weekend , though , left an even greater mark and it appears that the young footballer will not lack confidence against @entity91 in @entity92 on friday or indeed against the country where he hopes to make his living next season			1
' when he was young i used to work away a lot on cruise ships , ' revealed @entity21 senior			1
' when i came back i brought videos of @entity101 and @entity102 with me to show him			0
we sat on the bed and i showed him the videos of their best moments			0
' when i showed him one piece of skill from @entity102 , he said : " pop , where did he get that from ? i invented that "			0
' i told him that was impossible but he took me out on the porch and he showed me the trick			0
i knew then that i had a little @entity102 on my hands			0
high praise : @entity21 's dad has compared him to a young @entity102 ' when he was smaller , i was always taking him up and down to football school			1
when he was five i took him to one school and the guy said he could n’t take him as he was too young			2
so i told him he was seven and they put him in the team			2
he was actually only five and one of the smallest in the team but he was the best			2
all the time he was like that			2
' i always thought when he was growing up that he would be a great player			0
i just tried to support him and give him all he needs			0
he is looking forward to going to the @entity128			2
' @entity21 ’s loan with @entity49 is now up and he is due to report back to @entity24 for pre-season			1
his club manager @entity131 is in @entity87 working for @entity133 tv and will be aware of the impact his player could be about to have on the @entity5			1
taking note : @entity24 boss @entity131 is keeping a close eye on @entity21 ' hopefully he can see what @entity21 can do , ' said @entity139			1
' if they bring him back home to @entity24 i will be very happy			1
' if they do n’t then wherever they send him he just has to go and keep his feet on the ground			0
' he has always been good enough			0
he just needs them to give him the chance			0
i always had it in mind that @entity131 knows what is best for young ones			2
he always makes good players			0
' unfortunately he did n’t want to play @entity152 when he was 18 but maybe he will when he is 21			0
' @entity139 is travelling around @entity87 with his wife @entity153 and believes the party that has already started in @entity20 is about to get bigger			1
certainly the @entity156 underdogs have a real chance of making progress now that they have three points from their first game			2
' everybody back at home is very excited , ' he added			0
' i said beforehand that we would beat @entity12 , draw with @entity91 and beat @entity4			1
that is still what i feel			0
that is what i said			0
' the win on saturday did n’t surprise me			0
i told my son that			0
i am not sure he believed me			0
danger : @entity4 need to be wary of @entity21 ' if we come out with the personality i know the team has then i know they can damage @entity4			1
sometimes if you think too much it can cause trouble			0
' i know @entity4 are not better than us and if they are confident to just go and show what they can do they will beat @entity4			0
' my country is a small country – just a few million – and people pretty much ignore us			0
but if my son was @entity87 , for example , he would be famous around the world			1
