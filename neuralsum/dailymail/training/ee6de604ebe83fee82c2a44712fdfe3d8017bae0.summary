new research has found that as humans we all have a tendency to look on the bright side of life if you are struck down by the winter blues , take heart , for things will soon start to feel better			1
not only is spring on the way , but new research has concluded that as humans we all have a tendency to look on the bright side of life			0
a large study of languages spoken across the globe revealed that optimism is ingrained in human nature			2
scientists from @entity20 and the @entity21 studied the 100,000 most - common words used in the world ’s ten most - spoken languages			1
using mathematical analysis , they found that no matter their culture , people are far more likely to use positive words than negative ones			1
the study , which looked at the most popular words used in newspapers , books , films , the internet and on the @entity37 social media site , found that humans have a natural tendency to look at life with a cheerful slant			1
dr @entity42 , from the @entity43 , said : ‘ happiness is obviously important , but tough to define and measure			0
‘ we want to be able to do this in a data - driven , open - source way , so that both the public and policymakers can consult these metrics on a daily basis , as they might interest rates or stock tickers			2
’ he added : ‘ it does n’t matter whether it ’s @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 or @entity60 ─ the words that make up our languages are universally biased towards positive emotions			1
’ the researchers analysed the 10,000 most spoken words in each of ten languages - @entity57 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity58 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity59			1
they asked native speakers to rate whether those words were ‘ happy ’ or ‘ sad ’ on a 1 to 9 scale			2
the results , published in the @entity78 last night ( monday ) , revealed a positive slant in the way in which humans communicate , no matter the language			0
the study of languages spoken across the globe revealed optimism is ingrained in human nature			0
file photo even though all ten languages were positively biased , there were some differences between them - @entity58 and @entity69 were the ‘ happiest ’ and @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity59 were the ‘ saddest ’			1
the research provides evidence which backs up the ‘ @entity96 hypothesis ’ which holds that the human subconscious naturally leans towards optimism			0
it also explains previous research which shows that people often expect too much out of life			0
for example , we know that around 50 per cent of marriages end in divorce , but even people who have had a number of failed marriages continue to tie the knot again			0
this tendency , which psychologists call the ‘ triumph of hope over experience ’ , means we also tend to think we will live longer and be more successful than average , and underestimate our likelihood of having cancer .			0
