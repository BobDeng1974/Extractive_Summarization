anti-slavery activist @entity0 , who could be set to be the first female to feature on a @entity3 banknote an escaped slave who helped to free others from their captors could be set to become the first female face on a @entity3 banknote			1
a campaign has been gathering pace to replace former president @entity11 on $ 20 bills with that of a female for the first time in history			1
an online petition has now been set up with site visitors asked to vote for which female historical figure should feature on the bill			2
and it seems that illiterate black woman @entity0 is leading the way to be nominated as the new face before the petition is formally handed over to president @entity26			1
the petition has been set up on the website womenon20s.org , which is calling for @entity11 to be replaced due to his negative treatment of @entity30			1
a 15 - strong shortlist has been drawn up , which includes @entity0 , who was born into slavery in 1822 in @entity33			2
in 1849 she escaped her owners , fleeing north and then subsequently made several missions to rescue friends and family , who remained enslaved , by using a network of safehouses known as the @entity40			0
after the @entity41 she continued to be an advocate for education and joined early campaigns for women 's equality and suffrage			0
others on the list include @entity49 , whose refusal to give up her seat on a bus sparked the modern civil rights movement and @entity54 , a former first lady			1
the faces on @entity3 bank notes have remained the same since 1929 , but president @entity26 has signalled he would be open to change			2
civil rights activist @entity49 , left , and former first lady @entity54 , who are also on the shortlist to appear on the $ 20 bill currently , the $ 20 bill features the face of seventh @entity3 president @entity11 , who became much maligned due to this treatment of @entity30 the campaign , is hoping that if it is successful , a note featuring a woman would go into circulation by 2020			1
petition organiser @entity68 told @entity70 : ' there are no women on the money and i thought gee this is a crazy omission			0
' the petition mirrors a similar campaign in the @entity79 to get @entity80 as the face of a £ 10 note after a public outcry that every banknote featured a man			2
the @entity87 governor @entity86 unveiled the new design as a tribute to ‘ one of the greatest writers in @entity93 literature ’ which will appear from 2017 , replacing naturalist @entity95			0
a similar campaign in the @entity79 will see a £ 10 note , pictured , with the face of author @entity80 on it go into circulation in 2017 the announcement was hailed as a ‘ brilliant day for women ’ by journalist @entity103 , who had led a high - profile campaign on social media to ensure a female face would remain on banknotes after the @entity87 dropped social reformer @entity108 from the £ 5 note in favour of @entity110			0
but days later she began receiving a stream of abuse from 86 @entity114 accounts			0
arts college graduate @entity115 , 23 , and unemployed recluse @entity116 , 25 were jailed after threatening to kill and rape @entity118 for her campaign .			0
