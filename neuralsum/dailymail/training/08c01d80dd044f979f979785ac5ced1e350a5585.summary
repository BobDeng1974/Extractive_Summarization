by @entity0 published : 20:14 est , 5 january 2013 updated : 21:59 est , 5 january 2013 funds : @entity2 used cash to pay for household charge fight a blunder by @entity7 officials who omitted a single word from the guidelines for claiming expenses means that tds are allowed to claim for travel across the length and breadth of the country			1
in july , socialist tds @entity16 , @entity2 and @entity18 came under intense pressure to pay back expenses they had used to fund their nationwide campaign against the household charge			0
the @entity7 even issued a press release insisting such expenses could only be used for travel within a politician ’s constituency , not outside – and that they would have to return the money			1
however , legal advice from the attorney general passed on to red - faced @entity7 officials confirmed that the @entity11 could in fact claim for travel outside @entity35			1
and it was all because of a mistake made by the @entity7 when it prepared guidelines on expenses			2
under the expenses regime in place in 2010 , it was made specifically clear that travel claims covered only a td ’s constituency			2
however , when new booklets were prepared following the election of march 2011 , the word ‘ constituency ’ had accidentally been omitted			1
@entity51 emails obtained by the @entity52 reveal how the error was only spotted after controversy arose over the @entity17			0
deputy @entity16 had faced calls to pay back in excess of € 1,000 while a number of other tds including ms @entity2 and ms @entity18 also admitted they had used their expenses to pay for travel outside of their constituencies			0
an email from @entity7 staff member @entity66 outlined how the problem had only cropped up when a new travel and accommodation allowance was being introduced for politicians			0
it said : ‘ as all legislation and regulations ... had specified travel as constituency travel , the information booklet , issued to members in march 2010 , specified that “ other travel ” was constituency travel			2
‘ however , subsequent booklets – including those that issued to the new members after the election quoted the regulation directly and referred to “ travel expenses which the member is obliged to incur in the performance of his or her duties ”			0
pressure : td @entity18 , left , was told to pay back cash she had claimed while @entity16 , right , was furious at press coverage he described as ' malicious ' ‘ the fact that the regulation excluded the word “ constituency ” when referring to travel has , in our view , raised a legal issue which may have to be clarified by the attorney general			1
’ ms @entity66 said the @entity7 believed that their intention had been clear and that the payment was meant only to cover constituency travel			2
she said : ‘ notwithstanding that fact , however , the regulation does not specify that position exactly			0
’ the @entity7 then sought legal advice and were told the regulation did only cover constituency travel			2
they issued a press release saying so , heaping further pressure on the tds involved to reimburse the money			0
@entity117 td @entity16 was furious and wrote to minister @entity118 saying he had been the victim of ‘ malicious ’ coverage in the press			0
he wrote : ‘ it is not fair that certain media interests can use a lack of clarity to launch gratuitous and malicious attacks on [ individuals ] for their own reasons			0
’ separately , however , the @entity7 had also sought assistance from the @entity129 , who asked the attorney general @entity131 for her advice			1
the @entity129 said ms @entity131 ’s opinion was that the @entity7 ’ position was untenable because the word constituency was ‘ not explicitly stated ’			1
the @entity7 said that they had taken the view that non-constituency travel was already covered by the € 41,000 ‘ leader ’s allowance ’ that is paid to each @entity140 every year			1
the travel and accommodation allowance can be claimed by all tds and ranges from € 12,000 for @entity35 - based politicians to € 37,850 for those furthest away from the @entity146			1
the allowances are to be cut under changes announced by @entity149 in the @entity150 , with lower rates applying to @entity152 .			0

word ' constituency ' omitted from revised guidelines in 2011
attorney general says @entity140 could claim for travel outside @entity35
