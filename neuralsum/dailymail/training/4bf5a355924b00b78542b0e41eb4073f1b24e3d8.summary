by @entity0 published : 07:50 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 09:41 est , 6 november 2013 baby - faced crocodile hunter @entity1 has forged an unusual friendship with @entity4 's biggest croc			1
he has been handling the prehistoric predators since he was just five and now spends his days up - close and personal with his ' best friend ' - a 1,300lb crocodile , named @entity8			1
die - hard @entity9 fan mr @entity1 set his heart on working with scaly beasts after watching the @entity13 reptile handler on tv			1
now 20 , mr @entity1 has realised his dream by snapping up a job at @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23			1
he is only too aware that one wrong move in the enclosure could be fatal but that has n't tempered the keeper 's affection for the half tonne monster			1
originally from @entity30 , @entity31 , mr @entity1 said : ' there is no escaping from the jaws of a crocodile that big - but i love @entity8 like someone loves their pet			1
' whenever i am at the park i make sure to greet him when i arrive			1
@entity41 snaps : five - year - old @entity1 smiles as he handles the prehistoric animals			1
while most children might be scared , this meeting sparked his fascination with the creatures scaling the heights : common across the southern hemisphere , crocodile encounters are rare in @entity50			1
mr @entity1 had to relocate to @entity22 to follow his dream to become a handler smile : the odd couple pose for a pic at the @entity21 in @entity22			1
' there is always a certain degree of risk involved as they are born wild and can never be tamed			2
' at his size , if @entity8 wants to hunt something he will hunt it and if he manages to catch it then it will be all over			2
' the animals , which are normally found in the rivers and lakes of @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity13 have a brutal reputation			2
snap happy : @entity1 now works full time as a keeper at the @entity23 reptile @entity21 have regular shows @entity8 himself has already ferociously attacked his main rival at the park , another male called rebel			1
the rival tested the water , trying to become the aplha by tearing half of @entity8 's tail off			1
talking about the savage attack , @entity1 said : ' the young male , @entity79 , was temporarily living with @entity87 in the wild , crocodiles can live anywhere between 35 - 75 years			2
the reason crocodiles have that evil grin ? their mouth contains 80 sharpened teeth			2
each of these full grown teeth has a smaller tooth on standby in case one is lost			2
they can replace each tooth up to 50 times throughout their lifespan			2
generally nocturnal hunters , they use their acute night vision to stalk prey			0
unlike many animals , they can see colours too			0
crocodiles ' ancestors go back to the cretaceous period			0
modern snappers are thought to be around 200 million years old			0
crocs do n't bite their prey to kill them , they clamp their strong jaw and drag them underwater to drown them			0
larger species such as @entity119 ( found in the @entity121 subcontinent ) and are dangerous to humans , killing hundreds each year			0
daddy before being sent to another zoological park			0
' rebel was about 10ft long and we assumed that he would submit to @entity8			0
' however , @entity79 would often attempt to bask in @entity8 's favourite spots or court his favourite girls much to the irritation of @entity8			0
' late one afternoon as the park was closing , @entity79 decided he wanted to be the dominator of the pool and attacked @entity133 from behind , biting his tail and using the death roll to cut off a yard from it			1
' during the explosive fight @entity8 pushed @entity79 against the wall of the enclosure to expose the soft skin of his chest and ripped him open with a powerful bite			0
but the monster got his retribution and @entity79 's stuffed corpse now hangs in the visitor hut , a reminder to @entity1 just how vicious he can be			0
asked if he fears attack himself the calm keeper says : ' if he is relaxed then i can stay with him for as long as i like , so long as i continue to respect him			0
i interact with @entity8 to ensure our relationship is always a positive one			0
' close to snapping : @entity1 risks his life every day to look after @entity8 but would n't have it any other way , he loves the bizarre friendship battle scars : @entity8 emerged with half a tail missing following a scrap with alpha rival			1
he was 17ft long but now measures a still impressive 13.5ft relaxed : mr @entity1 takes a breather from croc wrestling in the @entity167 sunshine , a world away from his home in @entity31			0

@entity9 fan moved from @entity50 to @entity23 for love of reptilian beasts
his ' best friend ' already attacked rival but he still loves him ' like a pet '
