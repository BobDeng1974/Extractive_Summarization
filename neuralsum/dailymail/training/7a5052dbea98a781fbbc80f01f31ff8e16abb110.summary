by @entity1 reporter a drug used as a cancer treatment has been found to slow the progression of a fatal lung disease significantly			1
scientists from @entity7 discovered that nintedanib makes a dramatic difference to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( @entity11 )			1
the condition , which affects mainly men and former smokers , causes inflammation and scarring of the lung tissue			0
sufferers have an average life expectancy of between three and five years , with 5,000 deaths and 5,000 new cases every year			1
the drug nintedanib was previously used to treat cancer and has been shown to slow the progress of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis @entity26 works by blocking the chemical signals that activate the disease by creating excess tissue and scarring and causing breathing problems			1
the two studies , led by professor @entity33 , a consultant in respiratory medicine at @entity7 , compared the breathing capacity of 638 people with @entity11 who used the drug with 423 who took a placebo			2
breathing capacity is measured by the amount of air a person can expel after their deepest breath , which is seriously affected in @entity11 sufferers			2
researchers found that the decline in the breathing capacity of patients taking nintedanib was cut by around half over the two studies			0
the drug is now likely to be licensed worldwide within the next year , and avail - able to patients in the near future			0
researchers hope that the drug will be licensed to treat @entity11 within the next twelve months ( picture posed by model ) professor @entity33 said : ‘ the impact of this study can not be overstated			2
these are exciting results and mean nintedanib has the potential to offer patients a new direction in treating this aggressive disease			0
’ he said : ' the prognosis for patients with @entity11 is worse than many cancers and cases are increasing by 5,000 a year in the @entity72 alone , so the need for new , targeted and more effective treatments has never been greater			1
' @entity26 specifically targets some key molecular pathways known to be involved in @entity11 , which gives us a much clearer insight into how the body works and how we might be able to further develop treatments			1
he added : ' we expect an advance use programme to begin in @entity81 before next summer , so the drug may become available to at least some patients within the next few months			0
' researchers based at @entity7 ( pictured ) conducted the ground - breaking clinical study			0

5,000 people are **diagnosed** with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis each year
people **diagnosed** with @entity11 have a life expectancy of between three and five years
@entity26 has been shown by researchers to slow the disease progression
