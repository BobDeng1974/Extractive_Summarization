@entity0 is to coach @entity1 following his departure from @entity4 's team			1
the @entity5 became friends with @entity4 during their time together at the @entity9 - @entity8 academy in @entity10 and had worked with the @entity11 for the past five years			1
@entity4 announced last month that @entity12 and fitness trainer @entity13 had left the team , describing the split as ' mutual ' in a short statement			2
@entity0 ( right ) works with @entity4 on the practice court at this year 's @entity18 in @entity19 @entity21 's role in @entity4 's team increased under @entity23 but the 28 - year - old found himself taking a step back when @entity26 succeeded @entity23 as coach in the summer			0
@entity12 has wasted no time finding a new job , and landing a lead coaching position with world no 7 @entity1 shows the high regard in which he is held			1
in a statement on his @entity34 page , @entity1 said : ' dear fans and friends ... my new coach for next year will be @entity39 and @entity40 ... thank you to @entity41 and @entity42 for great time and fantastic work			0
' world no 7 @entity1 in action for the @entity47 at the @entity48 @entity1 began working with fellow @entity49 in 2009 but had been searching for a new influence after seeing most of his rivals appoint big - name coaches			1

it seems very likely , however , that @entity23 's appreciation for @entity12 's talents will have played a part in @entity1 's decision			0
@entity4 , who is currently at his pre-season training camp in @entity66 , intends to appoint a replacement for @entity12 to work alongside @entity26 @entity12 ( right ) sits in the stands alongside @entity4 's former coach @entity23 at the 2012 @entity69			2
