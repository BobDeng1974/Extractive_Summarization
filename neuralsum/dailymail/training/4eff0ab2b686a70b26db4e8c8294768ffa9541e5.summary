@entity14 student @entity13 captured the photo of this pygmy possum while on a field trip to the northern @entity19 , @entity6 ' i just could n't help taking the picture when the little fellow climbed up and clung on to my finger and sort of sat back on the rest of my hand , ' @entity13 said			1
' it is a western pygmy possum native to southern @entity6 and was taken on northern @entity19 , @entity6			1
' the pygmy possum was caught during a field trip at a site where it has been studied for 20 years to investigate how the pygmy possum population responds to rainfall in the semi-arid environment			0
these adorable western pygmy possums weigh between 8 and 21 grams and spend most of their time in trees ' pygmy possums are nocturnal and weigh between eight and 21 grams			1
they spend most of their time in trees , however , they do come down to the ground in order to change trees when foraging			2
' despite their small size , they can travel very quickly on the ground and this is when they can be caught in pitfall traps , otherwise known as a bucket dug into the ground			0
' @entity13 - who is studying conservation , molecular ecology , mammals and desert ecology - added that the little creatures can often appear to go missing from any given area for a number of years			0
' during dry years pygmy possums occur in very low numbers and can appear to ' disappear ' from the area for between five and ten years , however , after heavy rains the population can increase dramatically as they respond to the sudden increase in pollen and insects , which they feed off			2
at eight centimetres long , the @entity68 is one of the largest of the five types of pygmy possums , also found in @entity71 and @entity72 ' this is a very different to more temperate regions where possum numbers tend to be very constant			1
' they can also use torpor , a deep sleep - like state , to conserve energy			0
@entity80 is particularly useful when food resources are low or during low temperatures			0
' during torpor they curl up into a tight ball and are often found like this in the trap and it can take some effort to wake them up			0
