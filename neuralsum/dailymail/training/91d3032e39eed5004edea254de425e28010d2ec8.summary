by @entity1 reporter a government scientist kept silent about a potentially dangerous lab blunder and revealed it only after workers in another lab noticed something fishy , according to an internal investigation			2
the accident happened in january at the headquarters of the @entity11 in @entity12			1
a lab scientist accidently mixed a deadly strain of bird flu with a tamer strain , and sent the mix to another @entity11 lab and to an outside lab in @entity20 , @entity21			1
no one was sickened by bird flu , but unsuspecting scientists worked with the viral mix for months before it was discovered			0
cross-contamination : an internal probe at the @entity11 has revealed a new safety breach involving the dangerous avian flu @entity11 officials have called the incident the most worrisome in a series of lab safety problems at the government agency , long regarded as one of the most respected public health agencies in the world			1
earlier this summer , a lab mishandled anthrax samples and both the bird flu and anthrax labs were shut down			0
' we all feel horrible this happened , ' said dr. @entity44 , who oversees the @entity11 's @entity45 — which includes the lab where the bird flu accident took place			1
because of employee privacy rules , she said she could not name the lab scientist or the leader of the scientist 's team , who were both faulted in the investigation report released friday			0
she said disciplinary actions are taking place , but she did not provide any details			0
@entity11 's release of the report is one of many signs the agency is trying to make things right , said dr. @entity63 , an infectious disease expert at @entity65			2
but he added that the @entity11 should at least disclose any disciplinary measures , to reassure the public that the agency is taking the matter seriously			0
according to the report , the lab scientist was doing work with both bird flu strains — the deadly form and a tamer version			1
lab rules call for them to be handled separately , and the tasks should take at least 90 minutes			0
the @entity11 investigation found the work was completed in 51 minutes			1
that 's a clear indication the scientist took short - cuts , @entity44 said			0
@entity83 facility : a @entity86 government scientist at the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) in @entity12 , @entity21 , working with bird flu rushed through a procedure designed to ensure safety , allotting only about half the time necessary , in order to get to a staff meeting , health officials said on friday the lab scientist told investigators that the work was done in the proper sequence , but noted being rushed to finish the job and attend a meeting			1
@entity11 officials say it 's possible the scientist worked on both strains at the same time			2
in february , some of the mixed virus sample was sent to another @entity11 lab in @entity12			1
in march , a shipment of it went to a @entity86 @entity109 laboratory in @entity20			2
for a study , the bird flu virus was given to chickens			1
the chickens died , prompting @entity109 staff to take a hard look at the sample and detect the deadly strain			1
the @entity109 lab notified the @entity11 lab in may , and the @entity11 lab confirmed the finding			2
but the @entity11 team leader did n't report what happened to supervisors or anyone else , reasoning that the viral mix was at all times contained in specialized laboratories and was never a threat to the public , the investigation report said			2
@entity11 officials were only notified in june after the second @entity11 lab reported a problem with its sample			0
two weeks later , @entity11 director dr. @entity135 was notified			0
@entity135 ordered the flu and anthrax labs closed , an internal review and other steps			0
the anthrax lab director resigned last month .			0

scientist took *shortcuts* to speed up the work and accidentally contaminated the samples , mixing a deadly strand with a **benign** one
accident occurred at @entity150 in @entity12 , @entity21 , in january , a new report found
@entity11 shipped a virulent avian flu virus rather than a **benign** strain to a *poultry* *research* laboratory of the @entity109
no one became infected and the *pathogen* was *destroyed*
took @entity11 six weeks to admit to the blunder
follows the recent *exposure* of dozens of employees to live @entity163
