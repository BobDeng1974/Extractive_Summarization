during their time at ' the ranch ' , contestants were reportedly made to work out for dangerous lengths of time - up to eight hours straight - leaving their feet bleeding and causing some to collapse			2
once , they were even driven to a racetrack and housed in individual horse stalls , before a bell sounded and they were forced to run neck - to - neck , picking up heavy sacks along the track			2

' he was allowed to talk to his family , but he did n’t want to leave - the show would have been done with him			0
' the other former competitor said the trainers took a ' sick ' satisfaction in seeing them collapse - a result of a mixture of intense exercise sessions and severe restrictions on their diets			0
ms @entity102 added : ' they would say things to contestants like , " you ’re going die before your children grow up			2
" " you ’re going to die , just like your mother " [ and ] " we ’ve picked out your fat - person coffin "			0
' she said the one production assistant had even encouraged a contestant to take up smoking - because it would apparently help her to lose weight , impressing the show 's audience			1
