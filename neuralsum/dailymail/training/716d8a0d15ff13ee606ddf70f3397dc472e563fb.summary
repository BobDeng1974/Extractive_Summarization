by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 much like @entity4 ’s centre halves here in @entity6 , @entity2 is becoming the @entity8 chairman who commits too early			1
he repeatedly makes decisions before thinking them through			0
he makes embarrassing statements that have @entity8 spin doctors frantically sweeping up the mess			0
the throat - cutting gesture at the @entity21 draw , for instance , the declaration that ‘ the @entity16 will commit suicide ’ should they fail to progress from their group , not to mention the view @entity2 expressed on friday that two @entity21 defeats would be good preparation for @entity28			1
unnecessary : @entity2 has made a series of needless comments in his role as @entity8 chairman @entity33 : @entity2 reacted to @entity4 's @entity21 draw with a poor taste cut - throat gesture @entity35 : @entity4 crashed at the group stage in @entity6 but @entity2 says @entity37 will not be sacked really ? how so ? never mind the poor souls who have paid thousands to be in @entity41 on tuesday for what they rather hoped would be a big game			1
he suggested @entity47 , major rights holders for @entity4 games , had not done a terribly good job of screening the @entity49			2
and when he complained about a lack of opportunities for young @entity53 players , in almost the same breath he said the @entity8 should explore the possibility of @entity56 playing for @entity4			2
some say they like his dynamic style			0
hell , he deserved admiration for telling @entity61 president @entity60 he was out of order earlier this month			0
but when @entity2 became @entity8 chairman last year he seemed to have a dig at his predecessor for falling out with @entity60 , even though the stance @entity67 took after the original @entity21 voting debacle is looking increasingly justified			1
@entity2 simply shoots from the hip , often when it is n’t necessary			2
he backed @entity37 to remain @entity4 manager beyond this @entity21 long before the tournament even started			1
and he has backed him again when one more game remains against @entity74			0
there was no need to say anything yet — certainly when @entity37 was not even @entity2 ’s appointment — but rather than wait and see , @entity2 committed early			1
evidence would suggest he will be in no hurry to admit he ’s got it wrong .			0

@entity2 has already said that @entity37 will remain in his job until 2016 despite @entity4 's *humiliating* showing at the @entity21
he *infamously* made a cut - throat gesture when @entity4 were drawn *alongside* @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity74 in @entity89
