by @entity1 reporter published : 12:21 est , 11 december 2013 updated : 12:48 est , 11 december 2013 the @entity5 @entity4 jackpot grew to an estimated $ 400 million for the next draw on friday after no one won the top prize of $ 344 million on tuesday evening , lottery organizers said			1
the next draw is slated for friday , december 13 - considered an unlucky date by some - at 11 p.m. @entity12 ( 0400 gmt saturday )			2
if the winner chose to take a cash prize instead of an annuity , it would amount to $ 216 million , according to @entity4 officials			1
jackpot ! this friday 's jackpot is likely to hit the $ 400 million mark			1
will you be lucky on friday 13th ? up for grabs : no one matched the numbers of 5 , 12 , 22 , 41 , 65 and the @entity25 13 , meaning the jackpot will continue to roll pay to play : the @entity4 is played in 43 states and only costs $ 1 per ticket			1
whatta deal ! source : the @entity31 tuesday 's top prize had a cash payout option of $ 184 million , according to the lottery , which is played in a majority of @entity5 states			1
the winning numbers from that drawing were : 5 , 12 , 22 , 41 , 65 and 13 , @entity4 said			1
no one has won the jackpot in more than two months , pushing the purse steadily higher , although it remains well below the record - setting $ 656 million won on march 30 , 2012			1
the next largest prizes in the 17 - year history of @entity4 were worth $ 390 million and $ 380 million			1
five tickets worth $ 1 million were sold in @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48			0
those tickets matched the first five numbers			0
there â€™s no word which stores sold those tickets			0
it could be you : but then again , it probably wo n't be ! to win , you need to match six numbers -- five from 1 to 75 and one from 1 to 15			0
in addition to the jackpot , there are eight other winning combinations for prizes , of $ 1 , $ 2 , $ 5 , $ 50 , $ 500 , $ 5,000 and $ 1 million			1
if one ticket matches all six numbers for the $ 400 million mega-jackpot , the winner will have the choice of receiving the full jackpot in 30 annual payments , or a cash option of approximately $ 216.4 million before taxes			1
' the strong sales of @entity4 tickets mean more than just an exciting jackpot , ' said @entity77 , executive director of the @entity78 and lead director for the @entity4 group			2
' they mean greater profits to benefit each state in which @entity4 is played			2
' friday 's jackpot has been growing since october 1st , when @entity4 had its most recent jackpot winner			1
the jackpot has now rolled 20 times without a winner			0
feeling lucky : @entity89 displays $ 280 worth of @entity4 lottery tickets for her office pool that she purchased at @entity92 in @entity93 , @entity94 this is the largest jackpot since changes were made to @entity4 that include larger starting jackpots , a million - dollar second prize , and a new matrix of 1 - 75 for the first five numbers and 1 - 15 for the @entity25 number			1
one thing that did not change is the price of a @entity4 ticket : still $ 1			2
the odds of winning the jackpot are approximately one in 259 million			0
the odds of winning any of the @entity4 prizes are approximately 1 in 15			0
@entity4 holds the record for the largest jackpot ever , at $ 656 million			1
that jackpot on march 30 , 2012 , was split by three winning tickets in @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115			0
the average @entity116 is more likely to be killed in a mass murder than win the jackpot			2
fifty three times more likely , in fact			0
dying in an avalanche sometime in the next decade is 160 times more likely than winning			0
unfortunately , not all @entity5 have a chance of winning the biggest jackpot in history as @entity4 is only played in 43 states			1
however residents in other non-playing states can purchase tickets in the states they are sold in as there is no residency requirement to play and win			0
big money : @entity133 sells a @entity4 lottery tickets at a convenience store on the east side of @entity137 even non @entity5 citizens are allowed to play , but the tax they would have to pay on winnings is different			0
at 173 - million - to - one , the odds of scoring the largest lottery win in @entity5 history are so long they 're literally unfathomable			1
and mathematicians say there 's no way to improve them - except by buying more tickets			0
in theory , with such a massive jackpot would be possible to ' invest ' $ 173 million to play every number combination and then rake in $ 560 million in winnings			2
what would you do with $ 400 million ? there 's only one way to find out and that 's by filling out the numbers that is , at $ 1 a ticket , and 173 million possible combinations , you could play every number and increase the odds of winning to 100 percent and rake in more than 320 percent profit			1
( @entity166 , that begs the question : ' if you 've got $ 173 million laying around , why are you playing the lottery ? ' ) a lot of lottery players are superstitious and buying tickets on friday 13th may believe their luck is cursed from the start			2
but @entity175 , a computer programmer who developed a computer analysis to track @entity4 winning numbers since 2005 , said he has found no pattern - though higher numbers tend to be picked more often			2
the @entity4 lottery is designed to select five balls with numbers 1 through 56 and a sixth ball numbered 1 to 46 at random			0
that means , at least in theory , no number combination is more likely to be selected than any other			0
however , numbers 48 and 36 have appeared more than any others - about 11 percent of the time .			0

the 43 - state @entity4 jackpot is up to an estimated $ 400 million for friday 's drawing
no one has won the jackpot in 20 drawings
if someone wins , jackpot would be the fifth - largest in @entity116 history
the record was $ 656 million jackpot split three ways last year
