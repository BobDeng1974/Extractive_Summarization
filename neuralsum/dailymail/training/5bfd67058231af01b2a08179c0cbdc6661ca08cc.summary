for a while it seemed like @entity2 was done , another big seed facing a big loss			1
he was startlingly poor for two sets , slipping and sliding and whingeing and dropping points			0
then he changed his shoes and fortunes			0
sometimes the simple solutions are best			0
with new footwear he looked like a different player to the one who had followed a 6 - 1 first - set win by losing the next two 6 - 3 , 7 - 6			1
he promptly blitzed the fourth set 6 - 2 and then the third 6 - 2 to see off the 26th seed and set - up an intriguing semi-final against @entity17 , who crushed @entity18 so emphatically earlier in the day			1
nervy : but @entity2 did come out on top against @entity21 in a five - set thriller at @entity23 respect : the @entity26 26th seed pushed him all the way on @entity28 1 fan favourite : the top seed salutes to the crowd following his victory uncomfortable : @entity2 was two sets to one down at one stage , and seemed to be all at sea not his day : it was a frustrating day at the office for @entity2 on @entity28 1 on wednesday getting away from him : @entity2 stretches to return a shot to @entity21 but this was exceedingly hard work			1
at one stage , @entity2 was so tetchy that the outside noise caused by that @entity44 match was visibly bothering him			2
he waited between points , huffing and puffing and staring at the umpire			0
for sure , much of the frustration would have been born in his own performance			0
this was often rusty , uncharacteristic tennis from such a supremely talented athlete			0
to think it was all looking so easy early on			0
@entity2 charged through the first set , breaking twice as @entity21 fell victim to his nerves			2
at one stage , the @entity56 attempted a backhand from the back of the court and it barely reached the net , so misjudged was his power			0
@entity2 wrapped up the set 6 - 1 in only 27 minutes but even then was doing what he was needed and not a huge amount more			1
in the second , he fell a long way short			0
an element of that was down to his form slipping , a larger reason was the sudden discovery of range by @entity21 , both on serve and in the effectiveness of his forehand			2
from winning only six points on his first serve in the opening set , @entity21 took 13 of 19 in the second			2
out of reach : @entity2 tumbles in the third set as he attempts to return to the @entity56 physique : @entity2 returns a shot somewhat unconventionally , showing off his acrobatic side crucial : @entity21 celebrates winning the third set , putting him 2 - 1 in front he broke for 3 - 1 and quickly raced to 5 - 2			1
@entity2 had his moments , playing a sublime point at 2 - 5 , 30 - 30 , when he sucked @entity21 into the net and then played a delicious lob			1
but @entity21 , occasionally questionable under duress , held it together with some big forehands			2
he served out the set for 6 - 3			1
the 26th seed broke for 6 - 5 in the third and then gave it straight back , farcically dropping the first point of his service game by hitting the net with his racket on a routine smash			1
the tiebreak was then a calamity of errors , both players trading mini-breaks before @entity2 put a backhand long for 7 - 4 @entity21			1
two early breaks put @entity2 in command of the third set , not to mention a new pair of shoes after several slips			0
he closed the set 6 - 2 at the first time of asking with a service winner			1
@entity114 , @entity21 ’s coach , stopped smiling			0
from there , @entity2 closer resembled his usual self			0
he broke in the first game of the decider – crucially the top seed found his range on his backhand – and at one stage won 14 straight points on serve			2
he got a second break and , arguably , a second chance in these championships			0
@entity23 day nine roundup @entity129 in his hands : @entity2 hides his head in a towel on a warm day nine at @entity133 infrared image : a different look of @entity28 1 on wednesday			1

top seed @entity2 will play @entity17 in semi-finals after beating @entity21 6 - 1 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 7 ( 4 - 7 ) , 6 - 2 , 6 - 2
@entity17 beat @entity18 on @entity44 earlier in the day
@entity2 is now the favourite to win @entity23 for the second time
