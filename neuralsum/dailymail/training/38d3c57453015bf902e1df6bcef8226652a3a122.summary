when her culinary skills surprisingly let her down , @entity0 found a new ingredient for the @entity3 judges – a flood of tears			1
she appeared inconsolable after making basic errors during tuesday ’s semi-final			0
with tears rolling down her cheeks , the 21 - year - old philosophy student clearly feared she was for the chop			1
and whether it was the shock of messing up or a bid for sympathy , it worked			0
just add water : @entity0 bursts into tears as she awaits her fate before @entity19 and @entity20 she was spared by the judges , who put her through to next week ’s final , kicking out 31 - year - old @entity23 instead			1
however miss @entity0 ’s performance won little sympathy from viewers , many of whom have already claimed that judge @entity19 favours the attractive former model			1
on @entity31 , many criticised her weepy performance and suggested she survived only because the judges felt sorry for her			1
@entity34 wrote : ‘ i really just ca n’t stand @entity35			0
stop crying all the time			2
’ @entity37 added : ‘ i swear @entity35 has spent most of her time crying instead of baking			2
’ cry me a river : @entity35 gets a helping hand to wipe the tears from her face when a task does not go to plan a third tweeted : ‘ poor , poor judging – poor @entity46 so deserves a place – complete farce that @entity35 is through to the final ’			1
another described a spat with @entity53 over her decision to use saffron in one recipe as like ‘ a lovers tiff ’			0
this week ’s challenges required the four contestants to make savoury canapés , a charlotte royale dessert and an opera cake			0
miss @entity0 ’s canapés were praised , with @entity20 saying the pastry was ‘ beautifully cooked ’ , but her charlotte royale came last and her chocolate , almond praline and saffron opera cake ‘ did n’t have the finish ’ the judges wanted although it ‘ tasted good ’			1
falling flat : @entity35 failed to get the height needed for the technical challenge made it through : @entity35 was reduced to tears yet again when she found out she was in the finals they were left unimpressed by @entity79 ’s ‘ unmemorable ’ canapés , although her charlotte royal beat miss @entity81 ’s			0
she then made a banoffee - flavoured opera cake , which scored well on presentation but poorly on flavour , meaning she missed out on a place in the final			2
bookmakers have now made @entity88 the favourite to beat the other two finalists , @entity91 and @entity92 , next week			0
bake off will move to @entity94 next year after attracting @entity96 ’s best audience this year with an average of seven million .			0

student and *ex-model* through to the final of the @entity3
however , @entity0 *'s* tears have viewers *fuming* on @entity31
