@entity1 principal sir @entity0 says he has yet to decide who will be selected for this year ’s @entity3 despite @entity5 ’s claims that defending champion @entity6 will be chosen ahead of him			1
@entity7 , the 34 - year - old quadruple @entity8 gold medallist who became the first @entity9 to win the @entity3 in 2012 , said on friday the team would concentrate on delivering @entity11 - born @entity6 a second consecutive title			1
but with the tour due to start in @entity14 on july 5 , @entity0 told the @entity16 newspaper that he would pick his nine - man team after this month ’s @entity18			1
@entity6 , meanwhile , geared up for the @entity3 by winning the first stage of the @entity18			1
he completed the 10.4 - kilometre time trial around @entity27 in 13 minutes , 13 seconds			0
@entity31 @entity30 , a two - time @entity3 champion , finished second , eight seconds behind @entity6			2
@entity32 took third , nine seconds back , and @entity33 placed fourth , 11 seconds off the pace			0
the second stage on monday is a 156 - kilometre trek from @entity37 to col du @entity38			0
' despite the impression that might have been created , the team for the @entity3 is not yet finalised , ” @entity0 said			2
' i will be the one making the decision on who is in the team			0
i speak with our performance team , the riders can offer an opinion but they do n’t select the team and they never will			0
' with @entity6 selected to ride in the @entity18 , the traditional warm - up ahead of the @entity3 , @entity0 admitted the 29 - year - old is in pole position to lead the team across @entity54			1
front runner : @entity6 is in pole position after racing in the traditional warm - up @entity18 but @entity0 dispelled suggestions that @entity6 would have the final say on the selection of the team , especially given the fractious relationship between the two riders after @entity6 helped @entity7 win the @entity3			1
' trust and harmony are important considerations and it is a difficult decision , ” he added			0
“ i ’m not just talking about the harmony between @entity6 and @entity68 but harmony amongst the riders and staff			2
' people should be careful before thinking @entity6 is making decisions here			2
@entity6 is a great bike rider , he deserves to lead our team but ultimately he does n’t pick the team			0

@entity1 's @entity80 line - up has n't been decided , says @entity0
@entity5 claims @entity6 will be chosen ahead of him
