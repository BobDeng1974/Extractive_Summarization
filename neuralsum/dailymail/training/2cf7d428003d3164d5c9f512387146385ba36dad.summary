by @entity0 published : 13:26 est , 14 november 2013 updated : 13:47 est , 14 november 2013 a lawyer defending a bouncer who was convicted of raping a 20 - year - old woman told his client 's victim that she should have ' closed her legs ' to avoid being attacked			1
defence lawyer @entity9 made the remarks when summing up at the trial of his client at @entity13 on wednesday , the @entity8 reported			1
the newspaper said the 20 - year - old woman was drunk in the central business district when the bouncer , @entity17 , approached her and told her that he could get her into a nightclub where her friends were socialising			1
outrage : victims ' rights advocates in @entity22 on thursday condemned a defence lawyer who told a rape victim she should have ' closed her legs ' if she wanted to avoid having sex instead he led her down an alley and raped her , although @entity9 said the victim did not struggle or cry out			1
according to the newspaper he told the court : ' all she would have had to do was to close her legs ? it 's as simple as that			2
' ' why did n't she do that ? the reason she did n't do that was because the sex was consensual , as easy as that			0
' but his comments have sparked outrage among victims rights groups			0
@entity45 from the @entity46 described the remarks as ' horrific ' and an attempt to shift the blame for sexual assault onto the victim			1
she said the case , and the so - called ' @entity54 ' controversy -- which involved a group of @entity57 youths boasting online about having group sex with underage girls -- had thrown a spotlight on attitudes to sexual assault in @entity22			2
@entity45 from the @entity46 said that the @entity54 case , featuring a group of @entity57 youths ( pictured ) had already put attitudes to rape in the spotlight ' it is an example of victim - blaming comments and rape culture , which we 've seen all too much in the last week and a half , ' she said			1
' it 's very offensive obviously , and harmful for the victim and her family			0
' @entity9 admitted making the comments but said they came while defending his client and did not reflect his personal views			1
he told a @entity22 radio station that he was quoted out of context and that for anyone to fully understand what he meant they would have had to have attended the entire trial , which involved complex issues of consent			0
he said : ' if there had been anything unduly wrong with what i said i would 've been reprimanded by the judge and also the crown lawyer would have complained			0
' ' it was relative to the facts of this particular case			2
' the @entity8 said prosecutor @entity96 told the court that the victim , who was not identified , did not fight back because she was petrified of her attacker			0
she said : ' no , she did n't fight back , she did n't scream her head off , she did n't go running into the street screaming ? rape ! ' ' but this is n't an @entity105 tv show , this is real life			0
she was scared , and she did n't want to make the situation worse			0
' @entity17 is awaiting sentencing on the rape conviction .			2
