for the youths of @entity3 , a wealthy suburb of @entity4 known as ' @entity5 ' , @entity1 nightclub is a @entity6 of cheap booze , gyrating young women and pumping @entity10 pop. but before the waxed and preened sons of @entity16 's middle class can gain entry to this earthly @entity18 , they have to pass through a wall of muscle , the likes of which you would n't expect in this land of vegetarians and spirituality			1
beefy , square - jawed , arms the size of an average man 's thighs , although they are a far cry from the slim stereotype of an @entity16 man , these bouncers perhaps have little to outwardly distinguish them from their counterparts all over the world			1
it gets weird when you realise they all come from the same village - and most of them share the common surname , @entity40			1
bouncer : @entity40 stands with another bouncer outside a pub on june 17 , 2014 in @entity4 , @entity16 a few kilometres south , the twin urban village of @entity45 , near southern @entity4 's exclusive vip farmhouse belt , @entity47 , breeds bouncers			1
@entity40 , head trainer at the local wrestling school , or ‘ akhada ’ , told @entity52 : ' in this village , there is not a single boy who does not go to the gym			2
they are very careful towards their body			2
no one drinks and no - one consumes tobacco			2
' his boasts are perhaps a bit of an exaggeration			2
but physical fitness has long been a way of life for the young men of @entity45 , where wrestling has always been popular			1
many hoped - and still do - that their skills and strength would take them to the @entity73 , or careers as professional sportsmen			2
but whereas most who did not would have once ended up as farmers , soaring land values around @entity16 's capital have done for the cattle grazing land and fields of crops they once tended			2
now , to make a living , for many the best option is to take up what is locally known as ' bouncery '			2
two bouncers work out in @entity91 's gym , where they build the muscles that earn them a living in local clubs sweat suffuses the t - shirt of this bouncer as be lifts two heavy weights for a dumbbell bench press more than 200 men from these villages work on the doors of the pubs , bars and nightclubs of the national capital , act as bodyguards to local dignitaries , or secure private colleges , hospitals and upmarket hotels			1
for them , their bodies are their livelihoods , and they spend their spare time maintaining them with long , arduous sessions in the gym and prodigious feeding sessions to provide the raw materials for muscular growth			2
their efforts can earn them a good living			1
employers are willing to pay as much as @entity124 , 000 ( $ 835 ) a month for the most intimidating musclemen , in a country where the average monthly income is just $ 100 - and for many far less			1
but their talents are preferred to armed guards , whose gunplay can lead to unseemly scandals			0
@entity134 , who works at a private college in @entity47 , told the @entity136 : ' our bulging muscles and the glare in our eyes are enough to warn troublemakers			1
' ' when you come up against someone twice your size , you will think twice before taking him on , ' he said			0
a wrestler does push ups at @entity150 's akhara			0
traditional skills are important to the bouncers , who work unarmed trainees pose for a group photo at the akhara			1
with more youngsters craving lean , fashion model - like muscles , the village 's reputation as a breeding ground for beefcakes is now under threat @entity91 's gym , a 3,000sq/ft cement building lined with machines , racks and weights benches where the young men spend hours a day sweating and heaving for their muscles , opens at 4am and closes only at 10pm			1
it 's proprietor , @entity173 , boasts that his boys are ' the best in @entity4 '			1
but becoming a bouncer is not easy			0
youngsters face gruelling workout sessions lasting as long as two or three hours a day			0
it 's not all pumping iron , their regimens also include hours of wrestling practice and yoga , and @entity40 insists that they study up to class 12 before taking up security jobs			1
with many among them vegetarian , they must also follow specifically mandated diets to get the protein they need to bulk up			0
' my suggestion is they drink at least three to four liters of milk a day , ' @entity40 told the @entity197			0
' a dozen bananas and around half a kilo of fruit			0
during lunch , they also consume 1.5 to 2 kilograms of yogurt with three to four pieces of flatbread			0
in the evening , they should have two pieces of flatbread and one to 1.5 kilograms of almond - infused milk			0
' meat eaters can consume an entire boiled chicken , 10 egg whites , a dozen bananas , and 10 litres of milk a day			0
but just as the @entity216 's fashion for security work has emerged from changes to @entity16 society , new trends are threatening its future			1
@entity40 is particularly concerned about a new film which has had a bad influence on local youths			0
' ever since they 've seen @entity226 , they crave sixpacks			0
they want to be lean , ' he sniffs			1
@entity229 , 22 , is one of those corrupted by popular culture			1
he trains every day , but is also pursuing a degree in business administration at a local college			0
but , as he told the @entity136 , his ambitions have little to do with balance sheets or door work			0
' i want to become a model , ' he said .			0

@entity45 , south of @entity4 , is *famous* for security men
they can earn up to eight times the average national wage being bouncers
but some influenced by popular culture now want to build lean muscles
