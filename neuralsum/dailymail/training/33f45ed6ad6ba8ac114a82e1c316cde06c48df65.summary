more than 200 servicewomen have been sent home from war zones after discovering they were pregnant			1
an astonishing 99 were evacuated from @entity3 and 102 from @entity4 under rules that ban mothers - to - be from serving on the front line			1
commanders ordered them to return to @entity10 – sometimes on flights reserved for injured troops – as soon as their condition became known			1
six - month - old @entity14 , who was born to @entity15 at @entity16 in @entity3 , pictured with his grandmother @entity17 at the grandparents home in @entity20 mother : @entity22 , 28 , was the first @entity23 soldier to give birth on the front line incredibly , female soldiers are not forced to take a pregnancy test before deploying because top brass believe it would be an invasion of privacy			1
but the @entity30 has faced calls to introduce compulsory tests because it is ‘ unacceptable ’ that other service personnel are placed at risk of attack while evacuating pregnant women from the front line			1
pregnancy tests can be bought from @entity40 chemists for less than £ 10 and can give a result as soon as seven days after conception			0
official @entity30 figures showed 201 pregnant servicewomen have been evacuated from the conflict in @entity3 since 2006 and from the war in @entity4 between 2003 and 2009			1
the @entity30 said it was fewer than one per cent of female soldiers deployed on operations			2
most of the babies would have been conceived before the mother left the @entity10 but a small number of women may have become pregnant on a tour of duty			1
the @entity56 do not have a set - in - stone ‘ no - touching ’ rule for troops in the war zone			2
rules : 99 female soldiers were evacuated from @entity3 and 102 from @entity4 after commanders discovered they were pregnant ( file picture ) but all who serve there are warned that the @entity30 disapproves of sexual relations between troops and that any inappropriate behaviour would breach guidelines			1
those caught having sex usually face a rebuke from their commanding officer or more serious disciplinary action , depending on their rank and position			0
a defence source said : ‘ it would n’t be the hugest surprise that people get together at base to alleviate boredom and fear			0
but the vast majority of troops know it is utterly unprofessional and the consequences serious			2
‘ it ’s more likely people know they are going to be deployed for a long time so they have sex with their partner before they go and do n’t realise they ’re pregnant until they get there			0
’ in 2011 , private @entity94 , then 21 , from @entity95 in @entity96 , served in @entity97 unaware she was seven months pregnant			0
she conceived before going to @entity3 as a machine - gunner and thought her weight gain was due to high - calorie @entity23 rations			1
it was only when she collapsed in @entity102 after her tour that she realised she was pregnant			2
pre-deployment guidelines issued to every soldier make clear female troops should not deploy if they are pregnant but at no time are women given a pregnancy test by the @entity30 female soldiers are asked whether they are – or suspect they are – pregnant			1
this is routine so medical staff can ensure the inoculation does not damage an unborn baby			0
at the height of the fighting in @entity3 , between 500 and 600 women were posted at any one time			2
about 10,000 have served in @entity118 are barred from infantry battalions , tank regiments , the @entity121 and @entity122			0
but they go on patrol with combat units and risk firefights while in supporting roles such as medics			0
@entity130 mp @entity129 , a former commander of @entity10 troops in @entity132 , said he was against compulsory pregnancy tests			0
he said : ‘ i think you have to be very careful about suddenly ordering people to take intrusive tests			0
some get pregnant when they are actually out on operations in theatre so pre-deployment tests would not work with them			0
’ but major general @entity141 , the ex-commanding officer of @entity142 , said : ‘ it would need to be put across sensitively , but this would ensure that they are 100 per cent fit for operations when they deploy			0
’ an @entity30 spokesman said : ‘ pregnant servicewomen are returned home to protect the health and safety of the mother and unborn child , not as a punishment			1
