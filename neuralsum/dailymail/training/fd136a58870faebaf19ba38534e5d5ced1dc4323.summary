by @entity1 reporter last updated at 1:16 pm on 4th december 2011 apology : @entity5 's @entity4 contestant @entity3 wrote an apology for his actions but was still jailed a @entity5 ’s @entity4 dancer who reached the semi-final this year has been jailed for looting in the @entity11 riots , despite a judge commending him for a letter of apology			1
@entity3 , 18 , was part of the street dance crew @entity16 on the hit @entity18 show			1
but just a few months after his on screen success , @entity3 was arrested on august 8 during rioting in @entity22 , south - east @entity11 , and has now been sentenced to 14 months in prison			1
he pleaded guilty at an earlier court hearing to burglary after admitting stealing a £ 150 stereo from an @entity27 store			1
district judge @entity28 said he was considering a suspended sentence because he was impressed by @entity3 's letter , which told him he was teaching dance for free to make amends for his behaviour			1
@entity3 , who lives in @entity22 with his unemployed mother , claimed he was ' a bystander that got caught up in the heat of the moment ’ and promised it ‘ would never happen again ’			1
but on friday he was sentenced by a different judge , judge @entity39 , at @entity40 , who jailed him for 14 months			1
@entity3 's mother @entity41 , 36 , who watched from the public gallery , shouted at the judge : ‘ thanks a lot ’ , before storming out in tears			1
sobbing outside court , she said : ‘ i feel so angry i want to smash up the court			2
' why ca n't they see the difference between a good person who made a mistake and a real criminal ? ‘ my boy is n't a criminal			2
i brought him up decent			2
being locked up for a first - time offence is n't fair			1
‘ i 'm scared for him , i do n't want to leave him			2
i want to take my sleeping bag and stay outside the prison until he 's released			2
i do n't want him to be inside with all those real criminals			2
’ speaking before his sentencing , @entity3 admitted he was terrified that he might be jailed			1
he said : ‘ i feel stupid and really terrible about what i did			2
it has jeopardised my career and there 's not a day that goes by that i do n't regret what i did			0
talent show contestant : @entity3 , circled , as he appeared on tv 's @entity5 's @entity4 with dance troupe @entity16 ‘ i think in the back of my mind i was thinking everybody is doing it and i literally got sucked in			1
‘ i wanted to write the letter to the judge so he could see things from my point of view			0
' @entity3 said he did n't feel it was right to punish all rioters with prison sentences			1
he added : ‘ i think the harsh sentences that have been handed out are silly			0
to jail someone for 24 months for a first offence just does n't seem right			1
‘ i know i have to be punished for what i did , i just do n't think it 's necessary to send me to prison			0
‘ it makes much more sense to punish me by making me do community service - that way i can make a positive difference			2
' after his arrest @entity3 spent three days in a police cell			1
he said : ‘ when i got out and told the other members of @entity16 they were obviously upset and really disappointed in me and i have been suspended from the group			0
‘ it 's been a bit of a knock for them because they 've lost quite a few shows because what i did has given them a bad name			0
i do feel awful that i 've messed everything up			0
@entity3 had been about to complete a two - year course in contemporary , ballet and jazz dance at @entity113 , but dropped out after starring in @entity5 's @entity4			1
in court on friday , @entity3 's solicitor @entity114 pleaded with judge @entity39 to spare him jail			1
she said through teaching dance he acted as a mentor to hundreds of children and young people , about 50 of whom had asked her if they could attend court to support him			0
she said : ‘ they wanted to be here to say positive things about him , but i dissuaded them from attending because they would have had to take time off school or college			0
‘ how can i persuade you , @entity132 , to let him walk out of court today and continue doing the good work he has done in the community for the past eight years of his life ? ' but judge @entity39 ignored her pleadings and told @entity3 : ‘ you took full advantage of the fact the shop had been broken into and you went in and stole			1
' like for so many other people , it was an opportunity too good to be missed			0
‘ the total losses and damages incurred in @entity11 were quite phenomenal and the reality is that you have played your part in that overall damage			0
‘ there is strong mitigation in your case and i entirely accept that			0
it is quite clear to me you are a positive role model and have been for a number of years			0
‘ but by your actions you have destroyed a very good reputation and the reality is that this was a very serious matter and as a result there is no alternative to an immediate custodial sentence			0
’ the dancer was praised by @entity161 during his run on the talent show for doing something ‘ positive ’ with his life			0
@entity161 told him : ' i actually was very impressed with you			0
' i like the fact that when you get an opportunity to change your lives , you made the most of it			0
' his street dance group were popular with viewers , but split the judges when @entity178 controversially said they failed to live up to the 2009 winning dance group , diversity .			0
