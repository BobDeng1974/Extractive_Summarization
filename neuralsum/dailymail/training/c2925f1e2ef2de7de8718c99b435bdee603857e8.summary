it is one of life ’s little frustrations : you brace yourself with an umbrella on a stormy day , but the moment you step outside it blows inside out			2
now blustery conditions could become a breeze with the help of a storm - proof umbrella			0
tapered at the back , rather like a cyclist ’s racing helmet , it is said to be able to withstand winds of up to 70mph			0
the asymmetrical design is also easier to hold upright , helping its carriers appear unflappable on the stormiest of days			0
tests in a wind tunnel found that some women were unable to hold a normal umbrella in gale - force winds , but they did not struggle with the @entity35 design			1
meanwhile , the arm muscles of both men and women in the wind tunnel did a third less work when carrying the storm - proof brolly , according to a @entity43 study published in the journal @entity45			1
the @entity35 umbrella , which is thought to be the only type of its kind , was dreamt up by a @entity43 industrial engineering student , @entity50 , after storms broke three of his brollies in a week			2
after running up the prototype on his grandmother ’s sewing machine , he formed a company with two university friends and now sells the umbrellas globally , with prices starting at £ 20			0
the secret to their success is said to lie in the aerodynamic design which directs wind over and around the umbrellas , holding them in position			1
making a splash : @entity43 designer @entity50 claims the @entity35 brolly will not turn inside out ' storm - proof ' : the @entity35 umbrella can withstand gusts of up to 70mph , according to the designer unique : the @entity43 - designed umbrella was tested in a wind tunnel			1

asymmetrical umbrella can withstand gale - force winds without turning inside out , according to its @entity43 designer
@entity35 brolly *features* an aerodynamic design which directs wind over and around the umbrellas
