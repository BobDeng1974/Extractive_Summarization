last year , sales on that day dropped 1.8 percent to $ 11.2 billion , though it still was the biggest shopping day last year , according to @entity11			1
despite the big drop this year , @entity67 's @entity50 said he thinks @entity6 will remain the biggest shopping day of the year for the tenth consecutive year			1
