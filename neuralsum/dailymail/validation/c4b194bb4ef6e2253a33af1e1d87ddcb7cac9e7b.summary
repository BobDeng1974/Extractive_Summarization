on a damp day at @entity1 just over 50 years ago we gathered to report on @entity2 making his comeback from a broken leg			1
we were about to witness the amazing proof of what many us believed , that @entity2 was the hardest man of all in an era of footballers who tackled like tanks			1
the short , stocky , powerful wing - half who is enshrined in @entity13 folklore as ’ the heartbeat ’ of the first team to achieve the @entity17 championship and @entity18 double after the second world war had sustained a left leg fracture in a collision with @entity23 ’s @entity22 at @entity24			1
the iconic image of @entity2 confronting @entity26 of @entity27 during in august 1966 @entity29 's @entity28 grabs hold of @entity2 during a 1968 @entity32 match @entity2 pictured during a training session at @entity35 's @entity1 ground in 1967 @entity2 won the @entity18 with @entity35 on three occasions - in 1961 , 1962 and 1967 @entity2 is crowned by @entity37 ( right ) after @entity13 beat @entity38 2 - 1 in the 1967 @entity18 final @entity35 manager @entity40 with players @entity41 , @entity43 , @entity2 , @entity44 and @entity45 in 1965 @entity2 runs up the stairs at @entity1 as he fights his way back from a double leg fracture it was a serious , complex injury and it was nine months before his return , in a reserve match against @entity52			1
typically , @entity2 went thundering in for the ball			1
to our horror there was a snapping sound			0
still he got up but the trainer rushed on , took a quick look and heart - brokenly told him the leg had shattered again			2
the pain must have been excruciating but @entity2 insisted on checking the diagnosis personally			1
he stamped his foot on the ground and only as the cracked bone stuck out through his bloodied sock did he accept that he could not play on			0
even then he spurned the stretcher and walked off , trying not to limp			0
‘ never show you ’re hurt , ’ he growled as they hurried him to hospital			0
it was n’t the first time we heard him say that			0
as for divers , he despised them			0
‘ get up and be a man , ’ he used to bark at any opponent who made a meal of his tackling , which was an even more fearsome thing of which to be on the receiving end than it was to behold			2
but always , unfailingly honest			0
that was why he disliked that iconic photograph of him grabbing a startled @entity26 by his @entity27 shirt neck at @entity86			1
he thought it portrayed him as a bully			0
‘ no - one who goes into a fair challenge with me has anything to fear , ’ he used to say			2
@entity2 rises for a header in a 1968 league match between @entity13 and @entity94 at @entity1 @entity13 fans cheer as @entity2 shows off the @entity18 at @entity96 in 1967 @entity2 ( right ) rushes to congratulate goalscorer @entity43 ( middle ) with @entity37 in 1967 leaping to join in with the celebrations after @entity99 had scored @entity13 ' opener against @entity27 in 1966 proving his athleticism by jumping over @entity13 team - mates @entity41 , @entity103 and @entity43 @entity2 , then at @entity104 , challenges @entity23 's @entity105 during a game during the 1970s best again felt the full force of @entity2 's boot as the pair battle for the ball in 1971 @entity112 with the @entity113 after their 4 - 1 victory over @entity23 in 1970 showing off his @entity116 award in april 1969 @entity2 , who also played for @entity117 and @entity118 , was capped 22 times by @entity120 that repeat breakage of the same bone would have finished many a lesser man but @entity2 came back again , to resume his midfield partnership with @entity125 which was the axis of manager @entity40 ’s great @entity35 team			1
a legend which might have ended that day was to grow even greater			0
yet he regretted that the iron man image tended to obscure his remarkable ability			1
‘ i can pass the bloody ball , you know , ’ he would rasp in that @entity134 brogue brought down from @entity117			1
that was why we would elect him @entity139 down here , to follow the same award won north of the border			0
@entity125 , the thinking man ’s footballer , was esteemed as the brains of the team but @entity2 was very much more than the brawn			1
@entity125 was the captain but @entity2 was the spiritual leader on the pitch , the cement in their bond off it and their bridge to the fans			2
beneath that fearsome demeanour in action , he was engaging , amusing and charming and those who jostled for the team ’s company after matches at the pub near the ground , the @entity157 and @entity158 , enjoyed his generosity			0
@entity2 ( right ) and @entity125 are introduced to the @entity86 crowd before the 1981 @entity18 final @entity2 pictured during his spell as manager of @entity170 in the seventies sir @entity172 and @entity2 chat as they pose for pictures of their special stamps in 2013 that strong personality carried over into management , most notably at @entity104 where he picked up @entity180 ’s mantle and drove them to the @entity17 title			2
conscious of his role as a @entity13 figurehead @entity2 always dressed ‘ properly ’ and his one sortie into commerce was to join his lifelong friend and @entity35 fan @entity188 in a tie manufacturing business			1
@entity190 ’s was one of the ailments which afflicted his last years and in that sad sense we have been missing this great footballer and nice man for some time already			0
but none who saw him or knew him will ever forget @entity2			2
and certainly not that day when he had to prove to himself that his leg was broken .			0

@entity2 , @entity134 *enforcer* of @entity13 ' 1961 double winners , died aged 80
the powerful wing - half was known as @entity35 's ' heartbeat '
he never shirked a tackle and had a hard man reputation
@entity2 is best remembered by iconic image grabbing @entity26
but he was also a *cultured* and *influential* player who won plenty of medals
