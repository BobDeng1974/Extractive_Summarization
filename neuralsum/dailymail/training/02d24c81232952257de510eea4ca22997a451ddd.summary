five - year - old @entity2 brain cancer patient @entity0 has left intensive care in a hospital in @entity5 after undergoing potentially life - saving treatment			1
@entity7 , spokeswoman of the @entity8 of @entity5 , said the boy had been moved into his own private room following another round of proton beam therapy			1
' @entity0 left the intensive care unit on tuesday and has been put in an individual room , ' she said			1
he has ' started to put on weight , he is smiling , and he is reacting to the gestures of his parents and those close to him , ' she added			0
@entity0 has already undergone several round of the treatment , with the thirtieth and last of the sessions will take place on october 24			1
his case made headlines after his parents , @entity43 and @entity44 , fled @entity47 with their son in september			0
the pair were concerned about the side effects of treatment he was to receive in the @entity2 , and instead wanted to have the boy treated with proton beam therapy in @entity5			1
when the @entity29 said it would not fund the treatment , they fled to @entity57 where they planned to sell a house before travelling on to @entity5			2
however , @entity60 issued a @entity61 after discovering the family had left hospital in the @entity2 and the couple were held by police in @entity66 in @entity57			0
@entity0 was taken to hospital and the @entity68 were told none of the family could visit him			2
the couple were held in prison for 72 hours before international outcry - including criticism of the ' heavy handed ' treatment from prime minister @entity76 - led to the order to release them			0
following tests @entity0 was deemed suitable for proton beam therapy , and in an usual move the @entity29 agreed to fund the treatment on september 26			1
@entity0 's case rose to prominence after the boy 's parents were arrested in @entity57 while trying to take their son abroad for treatment , afraid that the radiotherapy used in the @entity2 would cause excessive damage to his brain but in further controversy , a children 's charity that raised £ 50,000 to fund @entity0 's treatment said yesterday that it would not be handing over the money because the @entity29 was covering it			2
@entity0 's older brother , @entity25 , said the family has sent a request to @entity26 for the money to cover the cost of their legal bills , but were branded ' greedy ' by the charity			0
he wrote on @entity103 : ' we have asked @entity105 to support us with paying for the legal fees involving the custody and the release of my parents from prison as well as living expenses whilst we are in @entity5			0
' kids n @entity26 came back with a reply saying that they were not willing to help us , they said we are greedy asking for help ... ' @entity26 have never given us any money and they are refusing to help us now			0
' kids n @entity26 said while it had been prepared to meet the £ 100,000 cost of the treatment in @entity5 , because the money had been donated specifically for the therapy this would now be used to help other children in similar need			1
the charity said it was not able to use the money to cover the legal costs incurred by the family because this was not part of the charity 's aims .			0
