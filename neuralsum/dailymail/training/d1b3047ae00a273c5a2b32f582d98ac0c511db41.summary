by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:17 est , 20 december 2012 updated : 21:07 est , 20 december 2012 work and pensions @entity2 said he was looking at how a ' welfare card ' would work in practice welfare claimants may soon be given credits on a card instead of cash to stop them buying alcohol or drugs with taxpayer money			1
work and pensions secretary @entity2 said yesterday : ‘ for somebody who has a history of drug addiction , giving cash sometimes can lead to further problems			1
’ @entity19 backbencher @entity18 recently suggested a @entity20 to stop all claimants buying anything with payments other than essentials such as food , clothing , energy , travel and housing			0
however , a department source stressed that mr @entity2 was only discussing addicts , adding : ‘ a welfare cash card for all claimants would be completely untenable and would go against everything else we are trying to do			1
’ in another development , mr @entity2 announced yesterday that jobseekers could see benefits slashed if they fail to look for jobs three times a week on a new website			1
called @entity43 , the system identifies suitable vacancies and provides advice on skills			0
it will be fully launched next year after a trial , with 370,000 companies already using it to advertise jobs			0
online recruitment firm monster will manage the site , which will be compulsory for jobseekers to use at the start of 2013			0
mr @entity2 said : ‘ your cv will do the work for you , even when you are sleeping , and notify you that a suitable job has become available			1
’ he said jobseekers would no longer have to use touch - screens in jobcentres , or wait for a print - out of jobs which had probably already been taken up			0
‘ if you choose not to take a job that matches you , then the adviser will look at your reasons , and if the adviser thinks “ actually , these are pretty specious reasons ” , he may call you in and say “ i think you really need to be applying for these jobs ”			0
’ mr @entity2 backed the idea of benefits being added to a pre-pay card which can only be used for certain purchases			1
he said : ‘ i ’ve been looking at this process to figure out whether it ’s feasible , how would it work , how does it match with legal obligations , so we ’ve already been examining this			2
‘ i genuinely think there are some areas where we might want to think about			0
’ he added that one cause of concern was drug addicts using benefits to feed a habit			2
‘ you know , somebody who has a history of real drug addiction , giving people cash sometimes can actually lead to further problems , ’ he told @entity88			0
it follows a move in the @entity97 by a backbench @entity19 mp to change the law to introduce a welfare card			1
@entity18 said he wanted to stop state money being used for non-essential , desirable and often damaging ( @entity102 ) products like alcohol , cigarettes , paid - for tv channels and gambling			0
mr @entity2 is prepared for a political battle with @entity110 over the @entity111 , which was published today			1
chancellor @entity113 claimed in the @entity97 the one per cent cap was to ensure fairness for those who go to work while their neighbours have their curtains drawn			2
but @entity120 , @entity110 ’s shadow work and pensions secretary , said : ‘ @entity122 is a naked attack on hard working families to pay the price for this government ’s economic failure			1
‘ i want to bring down the welfare bill			2
but they way we do that is with jobs			0
@entity110 will not support a @entity20 that does nothing to create a single new job yet punishes those who work			2

@entity2 is examining how a ' welfare card ' to limit how *handouts* are spent could work in practice
government launches website to find work for *jobless* while they sleep
@entity110 vows to oppose 1 *%* cap on benefits rises
