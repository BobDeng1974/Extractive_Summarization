swirling through the air in mesmerising saucer - like shapes , these exceptionally rare lenticular clouds are the most common explanation for @entity5 sightings			1
the remarkable - looking disc shapes were spotted by amateur photographer @entity7 , 42 , in the sky above @entity9 in @entity10			1
the formations , also known as wave clouds , were scattered over miles , producing a stunning spectacle			1
rarely seen in the @entity16 , lenticular clouds are formed when a tall geographic feature , such as the the top of a mountain , obstructs a strong wind			1
the interruption in airflow creates a wind wave pattern in the atmosphere on one side of the mountain and at the top of these waves , moisture in the air condenses and forms a cloud			2
as air moves down into the trough of these waves the water evaporates again , leaving behind clouds in a characteristic lenticular shape			2
mr @entity7 noticed them while driving to the shops and was so amazed that he stopped the car to retrieve his camera from the boot			0
he said : ' i tried to follow them to higher ground to get a good view			0
they were just so mesmerising and i thought they looked amazing			0
it is easy to see why people mistake them for @entity5			0

@entity88 lens shapes are exceptionally rare lenticular clouds and are also known as wave clouds
they are hardly ever seen in the @entity16 but were spotted by an amateur photographer in the sky above @entity10
the rippling effect is created by cooling air and the clouds are the most common explanation for @entity5 sightings
