by @entity0 published : 04:11 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 08:58 est , 18 july 2013 @entity3 scientists believe they have found a way to ‘ switch off ’ the extra chromosome that causes @entity7 ’s syndrome			1
researchers at the @entity9 have managed to prevent the condition in human cells in a laboratory			2
they believe that this breakthrough could eventually lead to treatments for the syndrome			0
@entity7 is a genetic condition that causes learning disabilities and a characteristic range of physical features			1
it occurs as a result of an extra chromosome called chromosome 21 @entity23 has already been used to treat medical problems that result from the presence of one defective gene , but this is the first time that silencing the impact of a whole chromosome has become a possibility			1
the @entity31 reports that the breakthrough means that this could now be possible			0
however , it will require many more years of research			0
a team of scientists at the university added a gene called @entity39 to lab - grown stem cells with @entity7 ’s syndrome			1
this gene is important in natural cell development as it turns off one of the two x chromosomes that are found in female embryos			0
the researchers found that it could be used in the same way to silence the extra copy of chromosome 21 that is found in people with @entity7 ’s syndrome			1
lead researchers , dr @entity52 , told @entity54 : ‘ the research means that we have a new way - right away - to study the cellular basis for @entity7 , that could help identify drugs for @entity7			2
researchers have managed to prevent the condition in human cells in a laboratory ‘ at the same time we have made it conceivable - not necessarily possible or effective , that still needs to be proven - but conceivable , that you could use just a single gene to correct the over-expression of the whole chromosome			1
so it makes genetic therapy for @entity7 's syndrome more conceivable where it really was n't before			1
’ @entity72 , chief executive of the @entity74 , told @entity54 : ‘ the findings could have serious implications for future work that may be of real benefit to people with @entity7			0
’ @entity7 is a genetic condition that causes learning disabilities and a characteristic range of physical features			2
it occurs as a result of an extra chromosome called chromosome 21			1
the degree of learning disability varies between people with the syndrome			0
people with @entity7 are often shorter than average , have eyes that slant upwards , small ears , and reduced muscle tone			0
they are also prone to heart defects , thyroid problems , infections , blood disorders and early onset alzheimer ’s disease			0
@entity7 is one of the most common genetic causes of learning disabilities and about 750 babies are born with the condition every year in the @entity103 .			2

@entity7 's syndrome ( @entity7 ) is a genetic condition that occurs as a result of an extra chromosome called chromosome 21
researchers added gene called @entity39 to human stem cells with @entity7
scientists found this ' silenced ' the extra copy of chromosome 21
breakthrough could lead to gene therapy to treat the condition
