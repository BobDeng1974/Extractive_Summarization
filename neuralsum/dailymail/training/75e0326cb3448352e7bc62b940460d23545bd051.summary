female cat owners are more likely to suffer mental health problems and commit suicide because they can be infected with a common parasite that can be caught from cat litter , according to a study			1
women infected with the @entity7 - or @entity7 - parasite , which is spread through contact with cat faeces or eating undercooked meat or unwashed vegetables , are at increased risk of suicidal thoughts			1
about a third of the world ’s population is infected with the parasite , which hides in cells in the brain and muscles , often without producing symptoms			1
risk ? female cat owners are more likely to commit suicide because they can be infected with a common parasite that can be caught from cat litter the infection , which is called toxoplasmosis , has been linked to mental illness , such as schizophrenia , and changes in behaviour			1
scientists from the @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 looked at more than 45,000 @entity35 women who gave birth between 1992 and 1995			0
babies do n’t produce antibodies to @entity7 until three months after they are born , so the antibodies present in their blood represented infection in the mothers			2
the scientists scoured @entity35 health registries to determine if any of women diagnosed as infected later attempted suicide , including cases of violent suicide attempts which may have involved guns , sharp instruments and jumping from high places			1
they found that women infected with @entity7 were one - and - a - half times more likely to attempt suicide compared to those who were not infected , and the risk seemed to rise with increasing levels of the @entity7 antibodies			1
lead researcher dr @entity57 , from the @entity58 , said : ' we ca n’t say with certainty that @entity7 caused the women to try to kill themselves , but we did find a predictive association between the infection and suicide attempts later in life that warrants additional studies			1
' the study is the largest ever to try and ascertain a link between @entity7 and attempted suicide and the first prospective study to document suicide attempts that occurred after the infection was discovered			1
dr @entity57 ’s research team at the @entity58 was the first to report a connection between @entity7 and suicidal behaviour in 2009			2
the parasite thrives in the intestines of cats and is spread through oocysts passed in their faeces			0
all warm - blooded animals can become infected through ingestion of these oocysts			0
the organism spreads to their brain and muscles , hiding from the immune system within ' cysts ' inside cells			2
humans can become infected by changing their infected cats ’ litter boxes , eating unwashed vegetables , drinking water from a contaminated source or , more commonly , by eating undercooked or raw meat that is infested with cysts			0
not washing kitchen knives after preparing raw meat before handling another food item also can lead to infection			0
pregnant women can pass the parasite directly to their unborn babies and are advised not to change cat litter boxes to avoid possible infection			0
dr @entity57 noted the study 's limitations , such as the inability to determine the cause of suicidal behaviour			0
he added : ' @entity7 infection is likely not a random event and it is conceivable that the results could be alternatively explained by people with psychiatric disturbances having a higher risk of becoming @entity7 infected prior to contact with the health system			2
' the findings are published online in the @entity120 .			0
