the ruling by judge @entity15 followed several blunders by prosecutors , who are seeking to prove the 58 - year - old @entity2 killed his third wife , @entity5 , in 2004			1
he is also a suspect in the 2007 disappearance of his fourth wife , @entity19 , but has never been charged in her case			1
a furious @entity15 admonished prosecutors on wednesday after the second witness in just their second day of testimony began talking about finding a .38 - caliber bullet on his driveway			1
@entity27 , a former neighbor of @entity28 's , hinted in his testimony that @entity2 may have planted it there to intimidate him			0
prosecutors later admitted under tough questioning by the judge that there was no evidence to support the claim			1
and @entity15 wondered aloud about whether the testimony made @entity2 appear menacing in jurors ' eyes and undermined his ability to get a fair trial			2
but after heated arguments by both sides on thursday morning , @entity15 told attorneys that ' the court believes that the defendant 's ability to receive a fair trial is not extinguished at this time '			0
prosecutors contend @entity2 killed @entity28 and tried to make it look like an accident			2
defense attorney @entity53 told jurors repeatedly during his opening statement that there was no evidence @entity28 's death was anything but a tragic accident			1
his defense attorney 's argued on tuesday that @entity2 was a victim of a 24 - hour news cycle and cable tv 's talking heads , which together created a media frenzy that did not subside until prosecutors had charged an innocent man			1

' just weeks before her death , he told her he was going to kill her and she would not make it to a divorce settlement and would never get his pension , ' @entity86 said during opening statements			0
@entity2 's real - life drama inspired a tv movie and a national spotlight was put on the case , as many speculated whether @entity2 used his law - enforcement expertise to get away with @entity28 's murder and make 23 - year - old @entity19 vanish			1
grave charges : @entity2 is accused of murdering @entity5 , left			2
it was initially thought that she had drowned accidentally in the bathtub , right , but after her body was exhumed her death was ruled as a homicide in memoriam : flowers and a small angel statue surround the grave marker of @entity5 , the third wife of @entity2 , at the @entity118 in @entity119 , @entity120 the first witness in the trial - @entity28 's close friend and next - door neighbor @entity71 - was called yesterday			1
she cried as she was shown a picture of @entity28 lying lifeless in her bathtub before describing the moment she found her body in march 2004			0
mrs @entity71 told the court she and her husband @entity133 , their son @entity131 and another neighbor , @entity132 , entered the home late in the evening after @entity2 told her he could not get in touch with his @entity136 recalled : ' i went into the bathroom , seen @entity5 in the tub and i ran out of the bathroom and threw myself on the floor and started screaming			2
' @entity2 checked @entity28 's pulse and when she asked if she was dead he replied : ' yes @entity71 , she is			0
' she said she noticed dried blood in @entity28 's hair and blood coming from her mouth , and she had bruises on her wrists and buttocks			0
mrs @entity71 said she offered to cover @entity28 with a towel ' because i did n't want people to see her like that			0
but he ( @entity2 ) said we were n't supposed to touch anything and we could n't do that			0
' the prosecution is expected to try and use statements that @entity19 made to her minister before she vanished in which she said that her husband had admitted to killing @entity28			2
while hearsay is usually barred , if the judge admits @entity19 ’s statements , the testimony could be damaging to @entity2 , according to @entity167 , a @entity168 attorney who has been following the case			1
distress : @entity173 and @entity28 , parents of @entity2 's third wife @entity5 , return to court as he stands trial for her murder ‘ what the judge is going to do is he 's going to wait and make individual rulings each time the prosecution tries to introduce hearsay , not give a blanket ruling , but listen to see if they open the door in some way that makes the hearsay admissible			1
he 'll make this a day by day ruling on these different pieces , ’ @entity167 told @entity177			0
‘ essentially we 've got @entity2 confessing the murder of @entity28 to his fourth wife , but we still have the question of whether that will come in			1
’ prosecutors will also try to admit @entity19 's statements to her minister that she saw @entity2 arrive home with women 's clothing around the time of @entity28 's death			1
@entity28 's sister may take the stand to describe @entity28 's statements that @entity2 threatened her with a knife and said he could make her death look like an accident			0
missing : @entity2 , right , is also the chief suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife , @entity19 , right taken in : police lt. @entity210 , left , and a fellow investigator escort @entity2 , centre , into @entity212 state police headquarters in 2009 ‘ that does n't concern us , ’ @entity2 's attorney , @entity53 told @entity177 this week			1
‘ anybody that knows anybody that has been through a divorce knows that people say things and do things that is totally out of character , and clearly @entity226 was trying to build a case to try and get as much money as she could			0
’ the outcome of the trial may also hang on which forensic pathologist the seven men and five women on the jury will believe : @entity235 or @entity236			0
@entity235 , who investigated @entity28 ’s death in 2004 and ruled that a gash on her head and bruises on her body were consistent with an accidental fall , died earlier this year			2
the defense will likely call expert witnesses to testify that the woman ’s death was accidental			0
@entity236 , who investigated @entity28 's body after it was exhumed in 2007 , will testify for the prosecution at the trial about what made him switch the cause of death from an accidental fall to homicidal drowning			2
‘ first , they are not going to be able to say that ( the death investigation was botched ) because it was n't , ’ @entity2 's attorney said			0
‘ by saying that if they had done a better job in the investigation , then they would have been able to prosecute @entity2 , that lowers the burden of proof			0
where you do n't have evidence , you presume innocence			0
