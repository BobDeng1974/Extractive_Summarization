@entity2 , 44 , says if the court , which only hears cases ' of the greatest public or constitutional importance ' , decides against him , he will go bankrupt			2
but the offshore construction surveyor from @entity20 , who says his credit rating was ruined after he disputed paying for a computer he did n't want , is determined to fight the corporate giants			2
' it 's too late for me to throw in the towel now , and besides , i 'm a very determined chap ' mr @entity2 said			2
' i 've spent so much on lawyers i 'm bankrupt already - i might as well go bankrupt for doing the right thing			0
' his @entity31 - style fight began in 1998 when he visited @entity4 in @entity20 and asked for a laptop with a built - in modem			1
he says the sales assistant showed him a model which was in a sealed box and suggested he buy it , saying that if there was a problem he could bring it back and get his money back			0
mr @entity2 bought the computer , putting down a £ 50 deposit and signing a credit agreement with @entity5 , a sub-division of @entity46 which provided @entity4 's in - store finance , for £ 1,449 to cover the rest			1
but he found when he got home that the computer did not have a built - in modem , and so took it back to the store the next morning , where the duty manager refused to take the computer back , refund his £ 50 or cancel the credit agreement			1
it began a fight that would stretch over the next decade and a half			0
mr @entity2 , who lives in @entity20 with his wife and two sons , aged six and three , left the computer at the shop and went to work offshore for a fortnight , returning home to discover the computer waiting for him			1
he took it back to the shop and sued @entity4 for his deposit			2
the company returned his £ 50 but did not admit liability , and @entity5 said he still had to make his credit payments			1
mr @entity2 said he told the bank what had happened with @entity4 but was told that if he did not pay , he would be putting his future credit rating at risk			1
mr @entity2 's problems began when he visited a pc world store in @entity20 in 1998 to buy a laptop ( file image ) the epic legal battle will be finally decided by five judges of the @entity8 , pictured , on 28 january subsequently the bank put black marks on his credit files with @entity82 and @entity83 , which , over the next few years , mr @entity2 struggled - and failed - to have removed			1
he said when he tried to buy a home in @entity85 in 2003 , these default notices meant he was unable to do so			0
' until you get a credit blacklisting you have no idea how much damage it can do - it has wrecked my life , ' he told @entity94			0
' at first i thought i would just take it like a man , but a bad credit rating affects everything			0
i ca n't do anything			0
' mr @entity2 bought a small council house in @entity20 in 1996 when he was in his twenties , with a view to buying a larger house once he married and had children			1
but he is still there because he can not get a mortgage for a bigger one			0
' people do n't realise how much damage a default on your credit record does until they actually have one			0
' i earn quite good money and have done for years , but i am stuck in my house and in so much debt because of the lawyers			0
' ' it 's too late to throw in the towel , and besides , i 'm a very determined chap			0
' - @entity2 in march 2008 , a decade after he bought the laptop , mr @entity2 was awarded £ 116,000 damages by @entity121 , which ruled that he was entitled to return the computer and cancel the credit agreement			1
but two years later , the court of session in @entity126 overturned the decision , saying that mr @entity2 was not entitled to cancel his credit agreement			1
the judges also argued that the @entity85 property deal fell through because of high spending on mr @entity2 's credit card			1
with the help of a legal charity , mr @entity2 now has the support of a top lawyer , @entity136 , and is taking his fight to the @entity8 on 28 january , where five judges will make a final decision over whether he was the victim of an injustice			1
mr @entity2 said : ' what makes me sick is that they 've had millions of opportunities to do the right thing , and every time they have refused			2
' it 's no longer about the money for me ; it 's the principle			0
why should these companies and banks be allowed to get away with treating consumers like this ? ' it sickens me			0
i just ca n't let them win			0
' neither @entity4 's parent firm , @entity158 , nor @entity5 parent company , @entity46 , would comment on the case today .			2

@entity2 , 44 , bought a computer in @entity20 's @entity4 in 1998
