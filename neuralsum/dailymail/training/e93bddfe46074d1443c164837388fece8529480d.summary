earlier this week , a visibly pregnant @entity0 wowed guests at a @entity3 charity event , with a stunning sheer polka dot top which she teamed with a neat belt and a shimmering knee - length skirt			0
but although she looked a million dollars , her outfit came with the considerably lower price tag of £ 89 - the cost of the glamorous semi-sheer top by @entity11 chosen for the event			2
and it is n't the first time that @entity0 has stepped out in @entity15			0
@entity16 , where prices for dresses average out at £ 50 , and @entity20 , which offers t - shirts for £ 40 and dresses for £ 120 , are among her favourites as are @entity24 and @entity25			1
high street meets high - end : @entity28 of @entity29 teamed an £ 89 @entity11 top with a @entity32 skirt at last night 's @entity35 charity event - just the latest example of how she uses simple styling tricks to make her low - cost labels look a million dollars but while low - cost looks might have been bought for bargain prices , on the @entity0 , they look anything but high street , thanks in no small part to her judicious use of accessories and penchant for teaming budget buys with designer splurges			1
her appearance at the @entity35 charity event was no exception			0
joining the £ 89 @entity11 bargain was a billowing silk skirt by top designer @entity32 , a patent leather belt and , of course , her stunning sapphire and diamond engagement ring			0
the @entity60 ' latest high street outing is the continuation of a trend that began the moment she joined the royal family in 2011 and chose a simple @entity16 dress for her going away outfit			1
she teamed the £ 49.99 pleated blue number with a pair of £ 129.99 wedge pumps by another of her favourite high street brands , @entity75 , while the fitted black jacket that completed the ensemble had been tailored just for her			2
a month later , at prince @entity80 's 90th birthday celebrations , the dress appeared again , this time with a designer @entity81 coat			0
updating her look : @entity28 wore a £ 189 @entity25 dress in one of her official engagement portraits , which she accessorised with dazzling jewels , including princess @entity90 's ring , reportedly worth £ 300,000 ( left ) recycling : @entity28 of @entity29 wore the @entity25 dress again during her visit to the @entity94 in @entity95 , @entity96 , in 2011			1
this team she jazzed it up with a hat by @entity100 , which can retail at nearly £ 1,000 ( right ) diamonds are a girl 's best friend : to open an art room in @entity105 , she chose a £ 225 kingfisher blue dress by @entity108 and added £ 1,200 amethyst and diamond drop earrings by her favourite jeweller @entity112 ( left ) @entity114 bling : @entity0 looked radiant in another high street design from whistles at the @entity117 , she paired the @entity119 dress with dazzling earrings once owned by @entity90 ( right ) since then , she has stepped out in a whole host of high street numbers , whether the @entity124 striped top she wore to watch prince @entity125 play polo earlier this year , or the tailored @entity16 jacket sported during the royal visit to @entity129			1
again and again , the @entity0 has mixed high fashion with high street style , although many of her purchases - among them the designer bargains she picks up at the @entity137 outlet centre - are later tailored to ensure they fit perfectly			1
but could there be more to the @entity60 ' high - low wardrobe than her love of a bargain ? fashion writer @entity142 thinks a desire to please a public fed up with watching high - spending politicians splash out could also be a factor			2
' there has been lots written about the @entity0 and prince @entity125 's spending , ' he explains			0
' it 's likely to be the reason why she is thrifty with her wardrobe and often recycles dresses and coats			2
even a @entity90 has to dress on a budget			0
' deja - vu : @entity0 's cornflower blue @entity159 that she wore the day after announcing her engagement to prince @entity125 sold out and she proved to be the frugal @entity0 when the dress appeared again just a month later at prince @entity80 's 90th birthday celebrations			0
she updated it with a swanky @entity81 coat , right luxe it up : @entity28 of @entity29 visited the @entity166 at the @entity167 at @entity168 in march wearing a £ 279 @entity11 coat and £ 400 emmy shoes and clutch , which was £ 290 by the same designer and it certainly seems to be working , with the @entity60 named the @entity175 's third most popular royal after @entity176 and the @entity177 in a recent @entity179 poll			2
her love of @entity175 brands has also won her acclaim from the @entity175 's fashion industry with her relentless championing of labels like @entity186 , goat and @entity32 giving business a noticeable boost			0
but while she 's no stranger to designer fashion , the high street , whether her @entity24 maternity dresses or @entity195 ' @entity194 ' shoes , remains a favourite			1
' we 're lucky in the @entity175 to have one of the best high streets in the world , ' adds @entity142 , ' and it 's good to see a royal appreciate it too			0
@entity0 has obviously worked out that designer pieces plus high street buys adds up to super-stylish - and she looks better than ever for it			1
' mixing it up : for a trip to the @entity210 ' studio when she was pregnant with @entity212 , right , she teamed a £ 38 @entity24 dress with a more high - end @entity215 blazer style icons collide : @entity0 met @entity217 at @entity218 in 2011 wearing a £ 175 @entity220 shift dress from @entity25 , £ 160 @entity108 shoes and a pricier @entity223 clutch bag , which cost £ 259 clever styling : @entity0 looked a million dollars on the red carpet at the @entity227 concert wearing a short figure - hugging black and tan dress costing just £ 69.99 from @entity16 , which she teamed with a @entity215 blazer			1

@entity28 of @entity29 often teams dresses by @entity25 , @entity20 and @entity16 with designer coats
makes low - cost pieces look high end by adding *expensive* accessories and shoes
she also has both budget and designer buys *subtly* altered so they fit her perfectly
fashion expert says her genius for combining designer and high street fashion adds to her appeal
