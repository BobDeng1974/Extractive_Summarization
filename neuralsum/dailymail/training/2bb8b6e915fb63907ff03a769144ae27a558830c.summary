‘ @entity148 , the speaker ’s chaplain , and @entity151 , the canon of @entity153 , have given me superb spiritual guidance which has given me the one thing everyone in this world needs , alongside air , water and food : that is hope			0
‘ @entity161 is that essential key to giving us a fulfilled life and they have ensured i have retained that hope			0
’ @entity9 said : ‘ this is clearly the most painful thing i have endured in my life alongside the loss of my mother in 2009 and the loss of my brother earlier this year			1
‘ @entity51 said when you are going through hell , keep going			0
and so i will see this through to the end with the support of the people that mean so much to me			0
’ the @entity36 mp added : ‘ returning to the backbenches gives me the opportunity to speak out on issues such as the over-building of new homes in the @entity36 , threats to the @entity189 doctors ’ surgery and cuts to rural bus services			0
‘ it ’s the bread and butter of politics , giving support to the people who put me in the mother of parliaments , my home for the past 21 years and a place that has meant so much to me			0
‘ i am proud to serve the people of the @entity36 and the best tribute i can give them now is to get on with the job that they sent me here to do			0
