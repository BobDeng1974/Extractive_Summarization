by @entity0 a man whose girlfriend refused to marry him because of his ' too small ' penis decided to travel the world and talk with men , women and medical experts in a bid to answer the age - old question ' does size matter ? ' @entity11 , 30 , based in @entity12 , @entity13 , filmed all of the conversations he had in destinations including @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 , and pieced them together to create a hilariously thought - provoking documentary titled @entity22 - out now on dvd			1
explaining why he decided to make his ' less - than - average size member ' a public concern , mr @entity11 told the @entity26 : ' i ’ve always gone after things i ’m insecure about head on [ and i ] saw an opportunity to answer a question that i think was bothering a lot of guys and			1
it was almost like doing a service for men in general			2
' mr @entity11 's one - hour , -24 minute - long film sees him battle humiliation and confusion as he candidly addresses his body hang - up			1
he even contacted former girlfriends to get their verdict on his ' package '			2
on a scale of one to ten , one ex gave it a ' three ' and another politely admitted , ' it could [ have been ] bigger '			2
caught on camera : a @entity61 video of mr @entity11 's failed proposal scored over ten million hits honest and open : mr @entity11 filmed all of the conversations he had in destinations including @entity17 and @entity19 , and pieced them together to create a hilariously thought - provoking film titled @entity22 while the woman mr @entity11 lost his virginity to recounted it as an unmemorable experience , where she apparently did n't feel a thing			1
' i do n't remember much , i thought we were just making out , ' she says			2
meetings with medical specialists confirm that mr @entity11 has a ' below normal ' size penis			1
refusing to give the exact size away , mr @entity11 told @entity79 magazine : ' i did a lot of measuring , and anyone who 's done it enough knows that there 's anywhere from an 1/8 to 1/4 - inch fluctuation on any given day			1
' it 's such a fickle creature			2
but if you were to say that the average penis is around five - and - a - half inches , i 'm below average ' ' it 's such a fickle creature			1
but if you were to say that the average penis is around five - and - a - half inches , i 'm below average			1
' however , over a series of interviews with women on the street , mr @entity11 was comforted by the fact that while size is an issue for many , it 's not a huge one			1
recalling their responses he said : ' you either get , " @entity103 , no ! that would never be a problem , " or " oh yeah			0
that 's a big problem			0
" it 's almost fifty - fifty			0
' he discovered that being ' too big ' can be just as much of a problem			0
in @entity17 he spent an afternoon with @entity111 , who has the world 's largest penis , to get a different view on things			1
but the full - time actor and comedian says the film is n't just about penis size and is about embracing all kinds of insecurities			1
an education : on his travels he learned about various methods people use to make their penises bigger shared knowledge : he also talked to men and women about their own sexual experiences ' after some screenings , people told me they relate to it but never had a penis , or seen a penis			2
maybe when they were younger they felt like they did n't fit what everybody wanted them to be			0
' and as soon as they accepted the fact that they are who they are , their life changed astronomically			0
' others who watched his film would open up to him about their own ' weird ' sexual experiences with current or part partners			0
' nowadays , there ’s just as much pressure on men in terms of body image , who you ’re supposed to be , and what you 're supposed to look like ' ' it ’s really cool to see people let their guard down like that , ' he said			0
in his film mr @entity11 also looked at the lengths some men go to make their penises bigger			1
the @entity18 offered the most dramatic remedies with turtle testicles and reptilian liquor sold as natural enhancers			0
one man mr @entity11 met tied and lifted 350lbs from the end his manhood in a bid to elongate it			1
he gave the bizarre practice a shot with 5lbs but did not recommend it			0
in @entity185 , he learned of an ' enlarging ' oil injection and in @entity187 he was introduced to dr. @entity188 , an esteemed penis enlargement pioneer			2
he removes fatty tissue from the abdomen of his patients and inserts it into the penis for a natural , enhanced look			2
mr @entity11 hopes his film will inspire more men to talk openly about their manhood			1
trying all avenues : one man mr @entity11 met tied and lifted 350lbs from the end his manhood in a bid to elongate it - he gave the bizarre practice a shot with 5lbs but did not recommend it ' i think it ’s a conversation people should have			1
people are so terrified to talk about it , but something we got into a lot is that all men are insecure about it			0
' nowadays , there ’s just as much pressure on men in terms of body image , who you ’re supposed to be , and what you ’re supposed to look like			0
' mr @entity11 came up with the idea to make his film after a girlfriend rejected his marriage proposal on a @entity224 at a @entity226 basketball game in 2012			1
a @entity61 video of the fail went viral , scoring over ten million hits , and mr @entity11 ’s girlfriend told him that one reason she could n’t marry him was that his penis was too small			1
one to watch : @entity22 is out on @entity232 now he said that he knew it was an issue in the relationship , but did n't realize it was a deal - breaker			0
‘ you can tell when , sexually , you 're getting somebody 's motor running or not			0
i felt like i was n't - but i did n't think she would run out , either , ' he said of the incident			0
mr @entity11 is now back on the dating scene			1
since news of his film broke , he says his penis often becomes a topic of conversation at the dinner table			2
' it ’s interesting because the times that			0
the penis has come up , i think i ’ve set the bar so low , girls are just surprised i even have a penis			1
' a girl i had been on a couple of dates with before , it came out and she said , " oh , my @entity260 , it ’s not that small			0
" ' he said after his extensive search to find out whether penis size matters in 2013 : ' i do n’t feel like i have a really small penis , i just know it ’s not a particularly impressive or special penis			1
but it ’s my penis , i love it and it ’s great			2
' but i ’m still insecure about it			0
this was n’t a magic cure - all for me			0
it ’s not like i ’m walking into parties and dropping trou [ sic ]			0

@entity11 , 30 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , refuses to reveal the size of his member but medical experts have confirmed it is below average
now back on the dating scene he said : ' i think i ’ve set the bar so low , girls are just surprised i even have a penis '
