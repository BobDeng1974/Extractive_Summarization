one can imagine the funeral			2
‘ mad ’ @entity2 , who died yesterday a fortnight short of his 91st birthday , will be given the type of reverential gangland send - off that @entity6 and the @entity7 pride themselves upon — plumed horses , ostentatious floral displays and the streets lined with people bidding farewell to a ‘ legend ’			1
yet the word ‘ thug ’ — or even ‘ psychopath ’ — does not do complete justice to the brutal nature of this man who was known as an ‘ enforcer ’ , meting out violence on behalf of the @entity24 gang in the @entity25			1
@entity2 , pictured left in his police mugshot in the 1960s , and right in 1956 before he was jailed for seven years typical of the obsequies paid to him by those who glamorised his murderous career can be found on the website madfrankiefraser.co.uk , where he was described ( before his death ) as ‘ one of the great continuing criminal links with the last century ’			1
sickeningly , the site elevates him to the status of some sort of precious historical artefact			2
‘ @entity40 ’ — he was never called ‘ @entity43 ’ by his acolytes because it was deemed insufficiently respectful — was a ‘ cell - mate and partner in crime to racecourse swindlers , train robbers and racketeers			2
he was quaffing beers with old man @entity51 while the @entity52 were still in primary school			0
’ summing up his criminal career , it added : ‘ @entity40 has been a contract strong arm , club owner , club minder , company director , @entity61 inmate , fire - bomber , prison rioter but — first and last — a thief			2
26 convictions , 42 years inside			0
’ the site should have added that @entity2 was an astonishingly stupid man — having been caught so often he spent more than half his adult life in prison			1
even so , he managed to get married once and have four sons			0
only one boy never went to jail			0
@entity2 , left , pictured with the notorious @entity24 brothers @entity73 and @entity51 , during their reign in the 1960s the @entity24 brothers - @entity51 and @entity73 - who formed the self - named gang , which also became known as the torture gang , in the 1960s			1
@entity2 worked for @entity24 outside prison , @entity2 was the sort of gangster who , in popular culture , is associated with the @entity25 ( though he was fortunate not to end up swinging in a more literal way , at the end of a rope , since capital punishment was abolished in 1965 )			1
in a sick comment on our age , he inspired modern films by directors such as @entity93 that revelled in the pornography of @entity6 gang violence			1
@entity2 ’s one redeeming feature was that he did not attempt to explain away his criminal behaviour			1
in his autobiography , he stated that there were ‘ no excuses ’ since both his mother and father were ‘ honest , hard - working people ’			0
born in 1923 , he grew up in a @entity6 neighbourhood full of criminals			1
it was there he acquired the habit of stealing , helped by his sister , who also became a professional thief			0
‘ you name it , we nicked it , ’ he once said			0
when @entity116 came , and men of @entity2 ’s age were eager to serve the country as soon as they could , he feigned illness to avoid being called up to the front line			1
‘ the war was wonderful , thieving wise , gangster wise , for everything			0
i ’ll never forgive @entity125 for surrendering ’			0
@entity2 was jailed for 10 years in 1967 for his part in the @entity24 gang , where he tortured people by pulling out their teeth with pliers if they were disloyal it was during the war that @entity2 was first jailed — as he noted years later : ‘ i do n’t regret one moment in my life			1
if i have any regrets at all , it was getting caught			2
’ in due course , he was called up , deserted , was sent to @entity138 for shop - breaking and then , shortly after his release , was convicted and sent to @entity140			0
his propensity for mindless violence — the aspect of his character his admirers seem most to enjoy — manifested itself early on			2
though not particularly tall , he was tough , physically fit , and learned early on he could get his way and command ‘ respect ’ by using violence			2
he particularly enjoyed assaulting prison staff			2
in the days before the abolition of judicial corporal punishment , this could have painful consequences			0
for example , in @entity138 , he was birched for such an offence , and in adult prison , later on , was given the cat o’nine tails twice			1
@entity2 boasted that he beat up the public executioner , @entity159 , in @entity140 in 1953 on the day he hanged @entity160 — the teenager executed for his part in the murder of a police constable			1
@entity2 said : ‘ sure i was violent , but only to people like myself			1
’ ‘ i suppose i ranked high , ’ he bragged about his place in the world of criminality			0
‘ i ’m quite proud of that			0
’ serving time in @entity170 for a raid on a jeweller ’s shortly after the war , his behaviour became so uncontrollable he was certified insane : his ‘ @entity43 ’ nickname was not the product of exaggeration			0
@entity2 dated @entity178 , daughter of the @entity179 , @entity180 , for a number of years between serving prison sentences for bank robberies in the early @entity184 , he acted as bodyguard to the notorious @entity6 gangster @entity186 , the so - called ‘ @entity187 ’ — carrying out razor attacks on victims for £ 50 a time			1
back in prison in 1954 , this time in @entity190 , @entity2 was certified insane again and sent to @entity61			1
surprisingly , he turned into a model inmate and secured a reasonably early release — only to celebrate his freedom by leading a violent attack on a rival gangster , @entity196 , and his wife , for which he received another seven years			0
free again in the early @entity25 , @entity2 was on the periphery of the @entity179 gang but worked regularly for @entity24 , one of the @entity51 ’ great rivals			1
even by @entity2 ’s standards , the violence became extreme			1
having set up a pub fruit machine enterprise as a cover for his crimes , he was accused of the shot - gun murder of another gangster , @entity208 , in 1966			0
but a witness changed his evidence at the last minute and charges were dropped			0
the following year , though , he was convicted at the @entity212 of torturing men who had been ‘ disloyal ’ to the @entity24			0
victims had their teeth pulled out with pliers			0
they were also given electric shocks , whipped and burned			0
@entity2 got ten years in jail			1

his crimes have been glamourised in the decades since his heyday horrifying : @entity2 at @entity227 in east @entity6 in 1995			1
he was notorious for his torture methods which involved pulling out enemies ' teeth with pliers while in @entity232 , in 1969 , he was one of the leaders of the notorious riots there			0
with the cat o’nine tails abolished , the usual punishment for his assaults on authority was the loss of remission on his time served — hence his almost permanent absence from the streets of @entity6 from the mid-sixties until the @entity246 , by which point he was an old man			1
@entity2 ( pictured in 2012 ) died yesterday at 90 after @entity2 ’s release in the @entity246 , he met the daughter of @entity179 , @entity179 — and they were together until 2001			1
even after reaching pension - age , @entity2 was no stranger to crime			2
in 1991 , he was shot in the head outside a @entity255 club , but refused to name his assailant — though he mischievously dropped hints a policeman was responsible			0
and only last year , aged 89 and living in sheltered accommodation , he had an asbo served on him after a violent altercation with a neighbour			0
but he spent much of his old age in a cynical and manipulative attempt to turn himself into a celebrity — something that was assisted by the parade of writers and tv documentary - makers who beat a path to his door to chronicle the story of his amoral and vicious life			2
by managing to outlive almost everybody else from the supposed ‘ golden age ’ of gangland crime , @entity2 achieved the fame and adulation he so craved			1
he was invited to play cameo roles on radio , television and in a number of gangster films			2
in 1999 , he launched a one - man show — an evening with mad @entity2 — that toured the country , a highlight of which was when he told his audience how he preferred the cat o’nine tails to the birch because it was ‘ more manly ’			2
he touted his memoirs and gave conducted tours of @entity6 ’s gangland			1
‘ honest , hard - working people were safe , women were untouchable , ’ he proclaimed			0
his purpose was to foster the malign notion that there is such a thing as a ‘ good , honest criminal ’			0
to anyone with an ounce of morality , such thinking — sadly taken up by so many film - makers and writers — is as repugnant as it is absurd .			0

gangland enforcer and torturer @entity2 has died at 90
but his treatment as a folk hero *belies* his history as thug and psychopath
he inspired films that revelled in the pornography of @entity6 violence
@entity2 was caught so often he spent more than half his adult life in prison
