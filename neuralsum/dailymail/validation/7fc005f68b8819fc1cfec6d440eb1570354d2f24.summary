@entity1 supporters have vowed to murder @entity3 staff because they believe the site 's policy of shutting down their extremist pages is a ' virtual war '			1
a mocked - up image of the site 's founder @entity9 in cross-hairs was posted yesterday alongside a diatribe written in @entity13 , which claimed @entity3 employees ' necks are ' a target for the soldiers of the @entity18 '			1
addressing mr @entity9 personally , it claimed @entity3 was taking sides in a ' media war ' which allowed ' slaughter ' , adding : ' your virtual war on us will cause a real war on you			2
diatribe : an image of @entity3 founder @entity9 in cross-hairs was posted alongside a rant in @entity13 it is nine years since mr @entity9 launched the site , which is trying to avoid being a vehicle for jihadi videos ' how will you protect your employees and supporters , helpless @entity39 , when their necks officially become a target for the soldiers of the @entity18 ? ' it also claimed killing employees ' outside a neighbourhood pub ' would be no more preventable than the massacres of @entity47 killer @entity46 and @entity50 shooter @entity48			1
it then said men and women , young and old , would all be targeted and closed by saying nothing would prevent the ' delivery of the holy mission to the world '			0
the rant was written anonymously and posted on the text sharing service @entity60 yesterday before being shared by @entity1 supporters , including on @entity3			1
a @entity3 spokesman told @entity64 law enforcement officials had been made aware of the rant and will assess whether it poses a genuine threat			2
@entity67 : the message compared its threat to the murders carried out in @entity71 by @entity46 ( left ) and in @entity50 by @entity48 ( right )			0
so - called ' lone wolf ' attackers are encouraged by online messages @entity76 militants have swept through huge tracts of @entity78 and @entity79 , murdering thousands of people and forcing others to conform to an extreme interpretation of @entity83			0
also known as @entity1 and @entity1 , they use social media a major propaganda tool in their bid to radicalise young @entity87 and persuade them to fight in @entity79 and @entity78			0
last year home secretary @entity88 said 500 @entity89 had gone to fight in the two countries , with cases emerging since then of schoolgirls fleeing to become jihadi brides			0
the terror group has posted gruesome videos and images of murder , including beheadings , on mainstream sites such as @entity3 and @entity100 alongside the hidden parts of the web			1
both sites have a policy of taking down extremist content and blocking users who upload it , but usually by the time an account is shut down the content has spread halfway around the world .			0
