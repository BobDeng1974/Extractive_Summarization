@entity0 was missing presumed dead after he was forced to crash land his plane on a @entity4 beach , but survived the incident to make it home to @entity7 when @entity9 opened the front door to see her son @entity11 she fainted , believing she must have seen a ghost			1
ten minutes earlier mrs @entity9 had received a telegram telling her that her son , @entity14 , was ' missing believed killed ' after he crash - landed his plane on a @entity4 beach during a strafing attack on a @entity18 aircraft in 1940			1
however @entity19 had survived the crash and after trekking miles along a beach and persuading a ship to take him back to @entity24 , he had dropped in on his parents to say hello			1
his incredible story came to light as his medals - including the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) - were put up for auction and his background was revealed			2
@entity19 had been involved in a strafing attack on @entity18 aircraft on may 10 , 1940 , when his plane was hit by ground fire and he was forced to crash land his @entity37 light bomber			1
at an earlier briefing all crew had been told that under no circumstances should they allow the plane 's secret interception radar to fall into enemy hands			2
after several unsuccessful attempts to set his @entity37 on fire , @entity19 decided the only thing to do was to shoot into the plane 's fuel tank			1
@entity19 and his gunner then trekked for miles where they met a @entity4 fisherman , who they persuaded to take them to @entity24			1
their journey to @entity24 took place just 16 days before the start of the evacuation of 300,000 @entity62 troops a few miles down the coast at @entity64			1
the vessel docked in @entity66 , @entity67 , and @entity19 travelled to his parents ' house in @entity7 in @entity70			2
@entity71 , of @entity73 auctioneers which is now selling @entity19 's medals , said : ' his mother answered the door and promptly fainted			1
' not ten minutes before she had received a telegram from the @entity78 stating that they regretted to have to inform her pilot officer @entity9 was missing believed killed			1
' she must have thought she had opened the door to a ghost of her son			2
' the authorities usually issued those telegrams fairly soon after a serviceman had gone missing and the tone of them was very much to fear the worst			2
' quite often news would eventually filter back that the missing person was in a prisoner of war camp somewhere			1
' but for a relative to receive that dreaded telegram and then literally 10 minutes later that person show up alive is quite remarkable			1
' @entity19 later rejoined his squadron at @entity95			0
he served with @entity96 throughout the @entity97 , flying under the command of newly appointed flight commander , @entity99			0
@entity19 's medals ( left to right ) the @entity29 , 1939 - 1945 @entity101 , with @entity102 , @entity101 , @entity103 and @entity104 medals and an @entity107 medal will be sold at auction just a few months later in november 1940 he had his second near death experience			0
his @entity37 aircraft iced up at 4,000ft and went into a spin			1
two crewmen bailed out leaving @entity19 to pull the plane out of the spin and land it safely			0
the squadron later upgraded to @entity118 planes and just a year later in may 1941 he survived a third close shave , when his aircraft was attacked by a @entity121 , seriously injuring his radar operator			1
@entity19 nursed his comrade and took the stricken @entity118 plane back to base			2
@entity19 went on to five ' kills ' , and was awarded the prestigious @entity29 for service			0
in april 1942 @entity9 was posted to @entity127 , based at @entity128 where he helped the unit convert to use @entity130			2
he later returned to his squad , 604 , and was promoted to flight commander			0
@entity19 went on to fly a @entity118 night fighter ( file pic ) and shot down several @entity136 planes in november 1943 @entity9 worked alongside lord @entity137 on planning the parachute landings for @entity139 and also helped develop the giant panjandrum - a huge cable - laying drum powered by rockets intended to destroy @entity18 mines on the @entity146 beaches			1
however this too almost ended in tragedy			0
@entity19 helped organise a demonstration of the pajandrum for top military officials only for the weapon to veer out of control and head straight towards the assembled generals , admirals and air marshals , prompting them to flee			0
an article in the @entity158 , published in 1943 , said : ' he is an exceptionally keen and skilful leader , whose personal example has been reflected in the high morale of the flight he commands			0
in spite of trying experiences , his enthusiasm remains unabated			0
' @entity9 's final posting was to @entity166 , working for the @entity167			2
this time he was involved in the planning for the invasion of @entity171			0
after the war he married wife @entity173 who served as an ambulance driver during the @entity104 and was no stranger to dangerous situations herself			0
in 1941 she helped transport a new false leg that was dropped by arrangement over a @entity180 base in @entity181 so it could be given to disabled flying legend @entity182 , who was being held prisoner			0
@entity19 died aged 57 in 1977			0
his widow passed away last year aged and now his medals are being auctioned by @entity187 in @entity188 for an estimated Â£ 9,000 on april 23 .			0
