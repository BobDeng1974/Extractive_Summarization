at last , some good news for @entity1 and @entity2 — apparently form goes out of the window in a derby			1
now is n’t that a relief ? on sunday afternoon , both sets of supporters will have the chance to suspend the depressing reality of their current plight			2
over the course of their last six matches — 12 in total — the pair have amassed a not - so - mighty six points			0
during that same period — 18 hours of football , no less — they have scored four times between them , conceding 22 along the way			0
it is little wonder they have billed this one ‘ the @entity26 ’			1
perhaps ‘ @entity27 ’ would be more apt. @entity28 issues instructions to his players during training on friday ahead of sunday 's derby @entity28 put his @entity2 players through their paces during the session at @entity36 @entity37 wraps up warm as he prepares his @entity1 side for sunday 's crunch clash @entity1 are the country ’s most out - of - form side and , unless new boss @entity37 can reverse what is a sorry slide towards the bottom three , they will be back in the @entity43 come august			1
@entity2 wo n’t be , but therein lies the problem			1
it is job done on @entity47			2
the @entity49 mandate is survival and little more , a dispiriting acceptance of mediocrity which has permeated a squad in desperate need of overhaul , both in terms of quality and character			0
the same can be said of a @entity1 side who have won just four times all season			1
if it was n’t for the history and intensity of the rivalry , this would have all the appeal of @entity68 versus the @entity69			0
perhaps that is being disrespectful to pub teams , however			0
but , amid all of the gloom , the stakes remain sky high , albeit for different reasons			2
for @entity1 , it is about survival			1
forget their bid for a record - making five straight victories over the enemy			0
forget , even , bragging rights			0
@entity28 is fighting to secure his future as @entity2 manager beyond the end of this season @entity37 was all smiles as he attempts to steer @entity1 clear of @entity88 relegation with trips to @entity91 and @entity92 to sign off their dismal season , this is one of six winnable matches which will determine their fate			1
@entity37 knows as much and hinted on friday that he is working on a six - game rescue plan			1
their last six have yielded just two points and one goal			0
should that sad sequence persist then it will end in a future - defining demotion to the second tier			2
for never has relegation come at such a cost given the fulsome flow of the @entity88 cash - cow			1
for @entity2 head coach @entity28 , it ’s about making a point			1
the outcome of this game will shape his future also			2
lose , and the chances of him landing the job beyond the end of the season will take a serious hit			1
‘ i have stopped thinking about getting the job on a permanent basis , i really have , because if i keep worrying about everything that ’s going on , if i keep worrying about everybody who has been linked with the job , then i wo n’t be giving this my 100 per cent , so i do n’t even think about “ permanent ” , ’ said @entity28			1
‘ in my eyes , i am permanent			2
in the contract i signed there was nothing about “ short term ” , there was nothing about “ interim ”			0
i am the permanent manager and that ’s my mindset on this , so i do n’t even think about the summer			1
’ newcastle are not in danger of relegation but their season has faded away in recent months @entity134 , who has scored twice since his return to @entity136 , trains with team - mates on friday @entity37 , meanwhile , will be gone come june , regardless of which division he leaves @entity1 in			1
to that end , his reputation is on the line			0
‘ if i did n’t think i could do it then i would have said “ no ” , ’ said the 67 - year - old , who has never been relegated , as a player or manager			2
‘ i need to give the players confidence			0
i need to be a little bit softer because of the position we ’re in , but if they do n’t do what i want then they wo n’t play			0
‘ the game against @entity154 [ 4 - 0 home defeat ] shows you that something is wrong			0
they will not play like that under me			0
’ history is at least on @entity37 ’s side			1
by a quirk of footballing fate , his predecessors — @entity166 and @entity167 — both won derbies in their second match in charge			0
‘ the pressure is on then , yes ? ’ laughed @entity37			1
he may joke and dismiss such coincidence , but those victories both played a part in @entity1 avoiding relegation			2
@entity176 ( left ) closes in on @entity177 during friday 's training session at @entity36 @entity179 works on his handling as he prepares to keep @entity1 out in the @entity181 on sunday and that is a recurring theme on @entity184 — a tedious tale of an annual battle against the drop			1
at least that , however , offers some perverse excitement for supporters			0
up the road at @entity2 , the club who returned profits of £ 18.7million last week are in debt to a fanbase which , mystifyingly , still exceeds 50,000 on a fortnightly basis			1
@entity197 has made way for apathy at @entity200 , for fans have accepted that , as long as @entity203 remains in power , their lucrative existence — at least that is for the owner — resides somewhere between 17th and 10th			0
for the @entity2 , it is ‘ @entity208 ’			2
indeed , many supporters resent their own club as much as they do their rivals across the river			0
throw in @entity213 returning to the @entity214 for the first time since his defection to @entity2 , @entity1 ’s @entity217 playing at home for the first time since his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15 - year - old girl , as well as a ludicrous 4pm kick - off in the middle of a @entity225 weekend , and you feel that a potentially poisonous atmosphere awaits			1
but the good news is that form goes out of the window			0
we can only hope that much is true .			0

@entity2 travel to the @entity214 to face @entity1 on sunday
