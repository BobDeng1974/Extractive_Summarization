even for the man universally known as @entity2 , it would have been a rather difficult concept to swallow			1
almost three years ago , upon the resignation of @entity4 as @entity6 manager , @entity5 briefly seemed destined to succeed the @entity7 in the post			1
fresh from his acquittal of two charges of cheating the public revenue , he seemed - in the public ’s eyes at least - a hand - in glove fit			1
@entity17 beat @entity18 and will want to dispatch of @entity6 at @entity19 on tuesday @entity20 still has the same thirst to see @entity17 beat @entity6 as he has done all his life for @entity20 - @entity17 legend , hammer of the @entity24 , scourge of defenders in three @entity27 and right - hand man to the then @entity30 manager , a very difficult question appeared to lie around the corner			1
@entity34 had famously assisted @entity35 at @entity36 ’ 98 but , although a proud @entity37 , @entity20 he was not			1
in the end , the question was never asked			1
just as they had done to @entity40 back in the day , the @entity39 overlooked the best man for the job , on this occasion in favour of @entity45			1
looking back now , that decision remains a mystery to @entity48			1
as much , indeed , as the answer he ’d have given @entity5 had he asked him to become @entity6 no 2			1
‘ there was certainly speculation about @entity5 and i thought he was a certainty , ’ said @entity20			1
‘ i do n’t know how things would have gone - and no disrespect to anyone else who was in the running - but i just thought @entity5 was a stick on			1
i ’ve worked with him for 10 years			1
he would have been spot on for a national team job			1
’ so , momentarily stepping into the hypothetical , how would he have answered the question that inevitably would have followed ? ‘ i do n’t really know , ’ @entity20 smiled			1
‘ it was never something we discussed			1
we were in the running for a @entity65 place and ended up fourth			2
@entity66 won the @entity65 , though , so that was us out			2
@entity20 ( left ) has assisted @entity5 for years and could have been with him with @entity6 too ‘ would i have gone as his no 2 ? he ’d have needed to have asked me ! it would have been a big decision for me			1
but it never came up			2
’ some things are better left unsaid			2
ahead of tuesday ’s encounter with @entity6 at @entity19 , it ’s evident @entity48 ’s thirst for defeating the @entity24 has never been quenched			1
he enjoyed heady days with @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 but none glossed over those epic encounters with the @entity24			2
‘ i played in nine @entity17 vs @entity6 games			1
the only one i did n’t play in was ’ 75 because we were in the @entity65 final and all the @entity75 players were exempt except for @entity84			2
he ’d been sent off in the semi-final against @entity86			2
‘ i made my debut against @entity6 in ‘ 73			1
it came a wee bit out the blue because @entity90 had said i still had a bit to do			2
but @entity75 played @entity77 in the @entity92 and i was called up immediately after that game			2
you ca n’t get away from winning your first cap			2
‘ but the following year , ‘ 74 , was a great year for me at @entity75 and we all travelled up after playing a testimonial at @entity100			2
there was the story about wee @entity103 ( @entity105 ) rowing out to sea before the game			2
i still laugh about it			2
‘ but on the day , he performed			2
it was just before the @entity108 and we were the only home nation who ’d qualified , so there was pressure on us to perform			0
that was a huge game because it would have been a damp squib if we ’d lost to @entity6 at @entity113 in front of 100,000			1
but we won and that was a great memory			0
’ @entity6 's 100 per cent start continued with a 3 - 1 win over @entity117 but @entity17 will not fear them despite being eliminated at the group stage in @entity120 that summer whilst unbeaten , mental images of that tournament , together with @entity123 ’ 78 and @entity124 ’ 82 , remain cherished			1
they also serve as a reminder to @entity48 as to what reaching a major finals means for the chief protagonists			0
‘ i remember @entity131 - and he was never a bragger , he did it on the pitch			0
but he wanted to show he was better by doing it on the pitch			0
he wanted to show he was better than the other guys in the @entity108			0
‘ you do n’t need to do anything else after that , because you ’ve done it and you are bracketed up there with those players			0
’ for the first time in seven years , @entity17 ’s hopes of qualifying for a first major competition since @entity36 1998 looks to be built on more than just blind faith			1
@entity148 has put wind in our sails again			0
in a section destined to go to the wire , @entity20 is reluctant to call the race just yet but there ’s no disguising his admiration for how events have turned			1
‘ i would not like to put more pressure on them by talking about that ( qualification )			0
but it ’s very encouraging what has happened			0
it ’s very much a @entity17 team			1
the parts are there but when you put it together it becomes a team bigger than the parts			0
if i was in charge of a team that ’s what i ’d like to see			0
you have a growth in experience and in the spirit of the team			0
’ @entity179 is one player @entity6 can rely on , and will thrive in the cauldron of hate at @entity19 @entity20 played in an era when @entity17 could afford to overlook a @entity65 - winning captain like @entity185 ’s @entity184			1
but while we will surely never again see such rich options at our disposal , the @entity186 feels a sense of strength in depth has at least returned			0
‘ what ’s emerged recently is competition for places			0
i do n’t think it was that intense two or three years ago			0
now you have players playing at a better level and they have an eye on others competing for their position			0
that ’s great for the manager			0
’ left - back is a prime example			0
with @entity208 required on the right and @entity210 injured , @entity207 has performed with aplomb			0
as a man who once made the trip from @entity214 to @entity75 as a teenager , @entity20 is thrilled to see @entity207 cope with the transition to @entity217 football with @entity219 as well as the international scene			1
‘ he ’s done really well			0
he played against us in the opening game of the season			0
he ’s a good player but there ’s one thing being a good player - it ’s another thing altogether taking on what comes with being an international player			0
he ’s shown great maturity and has taken it in his stride			0
’ @entity20 ’s growing confidence in those who now wear the dark blue does not stretch to him predicting what would be a famous win tomorrow			1
but oh how he ’d relish one			0
‘ it would be an easier place for me to go back to if @entity17 win ! ’ he laughed			1
‘ the rivalry does n’t get talked about much as the game does n’t happen as often but it ’s been a conversation in the last few weeks at @entity186 as i ’m sure it ’s been at other clubs			0
what did the @entity24 think ? the usual			0
’ perhaps it ’s best that question was never asked of him .			0

@entity17 host @entity6 in a *friendly* at @entity19 on *thursday*
@entity20 was close to being offered the @entity6 assistant 's job
if @entity5 had been made @entity6 boss he would almost certainly have been offered it but does not know if he would have accepted
@entity20 is hopeful @entity17 can qualify for a the 2016 *euros*
