what do you do with @entity2 ? it is a debate that has been raging for most of the season and shows no sign of ending			1
@entity2 is no stranger to being a hot topic of conversation but , in all the years i 've known him , i am struggling to remember a time when he has been scrutinised to this extent			1
some critics believe he should be out of the picture			0
others could n't be without him			0
where do i stand ? well , put it this way , if @entity18 were playing in a major final now , @entity2 would be one of the first names i 'd put down on the teamsheet			1
my reasons would have nothing do with sentiment			0
@entity2 is having a difficult season and here he trudges off after the home defeat by @entity27 the @entity2 front cover of @entity18 's programme for saturday 's match against @entity31 gerrard with @entity32 and @entity33 on the bench at the @entity35 and ( right ) after losing against @entity36 in the @entity37 at @entity38 if @entity18 had a penalty or a free - kick in a dangerous area , @entity2 is the only person i 'd want taking it			1
he 's proven that against @entity44 and @entity45 this season			1
he is also the man i 'd pick to play a killer pass and the one i 'd back over anyone else if he was racing through on goal			0
the issue , however , is that at 34 , he does n't get into those positions as regularly as he once did			0
furthermore , the dynamic of the deep - lying role he occupied last season has changed as @entity55 and @entity56 have not been around to provide outlets			1
after his outstanding efforts last year , he has yet to reach the same levels – who has in a red shirt ? @entity2 is not a great protector of a defence			1
he 's there to start attacks from deep rather than shield a defence as @entity67 or @entity68 did for me			1
now , though , his age is being tied in with his form			1
i know what it is like to reach such a stage			0
i remember playing in a game against @entity77 in march 2012 , when @entity78 scored a winning goal in the last minute at @entity38 , and dealing with critics saying i was finished			2
the @entity18 captain poses for @entity82 during an exclusive interview earlier in the season one of the high points of @entity2 's season as he scores a late penalty to beat @entity44 at @entity38 a week later at @entity90 , @entity89 took me out of the team			1
we lost again , this time 1 - 0 , but my replacement , @entity93 , struggled and i was recalled for the next game , against @entity45			2
@entity2 scored a hat - trick as we won 3 - 0			1
it was after the @entity45 game i realised it was best that i 'd been taken out of the firing line at @entity90			2
there is a saying in football , ' you have your best games when you do n't play ' and that was the case at the @entity105			0
your situation changes and people want you in the team			0
i found that again last year , when people were saying to me @entity18 would have won the league had i stayed			1
who knows whether they were right ? i knew when the end was coming			2
i had 18 months left on my contract and i knew i would n't sign another			0
like @entity2 , i was mentally tough			1
but when you hear constant references to your age after a poor performance or a mistake , it becomes draining			0
the high point of @entity2 's @entity18 career , lifting the @entity37 in @entity123 in 2005 @entity2 heads @entity18 's first goal against @entity125 that night , which sparked a remarkable comeback a swing of @entity2 's famous right boot rescues @entity18 in the 2006 fa cup final , which they went on to win @entity2 and @entity18 manager @entity130 hold the @entity131 after victory over @entity133 on penalties you go into games wondering , ' am i going to be physically able to get through this ? '			1
in your head , you have no worries about reading and understanding the game but when your legs go , they do not come back			2
@entity142 and his medical staff have done a superb job managing @entity2 's fitness			1
now they must manage the amount of matches he plays – @entity142 , himself , admitted in midweek that @entity2 ca n't play three games in a week to the level he would like			1
@entity2 will have had similar thoughts			1
over the next 18 months , @entity142 will have to start to take him off and leave him out for his own good			0
people have questioned whether the manager has the resolve to do so but history shows he makes big calls			0
@entity158 , @entity55 , @entity159 and i will testify to that			0
but that is n't a bad thing for @entity2			1
can you imagine the reaction inside @entity38 with 30 minutes of a tight game remaining and seeing no 8 getting stripped for action ? with space to exploit and energy to change the game , he could be a lethal weapon			2
another @entity2 rescue job - this time the goal against @entity174 which got then through in 2004 @entity2 and @entity176 with the @entity37 in 2005 ( left ) and exchanging the armband in 2013 sir @entity178 did it brilliantly with @entity180 and @entity181 , letting them miss the odd week , giving them 20 minutes from the bench and ensuring they were fresh for when he really needed them			1
that 's what has to happen with @entity2 , who i am sure will sign a new deal			1
@entity191 , @entity130 's former assistant , summed it up perfectly once when talking to us about squad rotation			2
he said it was n't important how many games you played in ; what was crucial was the amount of good games you played			0
do not doubt @entity2 's ability to go on making contributions , but do not underestimate that he needs help			1
take what is happening with @entity206 at @entity207			0
he is surrounded by top players , is being used sensibly and his reputation continues to be enhanced			0
@entity211 , by contrast , ca n't get a game for @entity213			2
who would have ever said that a player of @entity211 's quality would see his time out on the bench at @entity219 ? you need assistance when you reach that stage and @entity211 is n't getting it			2
a very young - looking @entity2 ( right ) and @entity176 ( left ) in action against @entity224 in 1998 the @entity18 lads show their determination to win the ball from @entity207 's @entity228 in 2000 @entity2 and @entity176 with the @entity229 after beating @entity230 on penalties in 2012 @entity176 passes the armband to @entity2 during a @entity234 match against @entity235 in 2012 @entity2 's situation is somewhere in the middle of @entity206 and @entity211			1
@entity18 need to sign a top defensive midfielder in the near future and it should not be that , on the 16th anniversary of his first appearance , he is still being looked to provide the inspiration			1
when the end finally came for me , against @entity213 in may 2013 , it was a relief			2
i also had the added bonus that i had been playing well and was able to finish on my own terms			0
for his immense contribution , @entity2 deserves more			1
he might not do what the other members of @entity18 's top three all - time players did in their final appearances – @entity89 lifted the league , @entity255 hoisted the @entity37 – but his journey has to end on a high			1
it is a huge blow for @entity258 to face another prolonged spell on the sidelines and @entity261 will be cursing losing a top player for three months			0
@entity258 was @entity263 ’s outstanding performer in their last two matches , albeit against inferior opposition in @entity266 and @entity267 , and won praise for the way he handled the holding midfield role			0
@entity258 showed off his bandaged ankle as he recovered from thursday 's surgical procedure he picked up this latest ankle injury by running through a packed midfield and , not for the first time , it is his ankle that is the problematic area			2
i fear this will not be the last time he suffers such an injury if he keeps playing an advanced role			0
every game i see him play , he seems to go down at some point after taking a buffeting			2
it is clearly having a detrimental impact			0
the image @entity258 shared on his personal @entity290 account showing @entity292 's challenge @entity261 stated publicly after his performances for his country that playing in the holding role was n’t @entity258 ’s best position but the question that now has to be asked is this : will being deployed in a holding role prevent these long lay - offs ? i believe it will			2
@entity258 could be back in training by february , but it will take some time to get back to full fitness this week i ’m looking forward to … watching @entity305 face their biggest test @entity308 's side have been given plenty of praise this season , attracting lots of admirers for the results they have secured , the signings they have made and the way they have played			1
they are second in the table , boasting the best goals - against column in the country , and people are wondering whether they should really be taking them seriously as contenders to finish the campaign in a top - four position			0
@entity308 's @entity305 side are looking to move further clear of @entity207 this weekend @entity328 will look to continue his rich scoring form for @entity207 against @entity305 now we are going to find out			1
after hosting @entity207 on sunday , a trip to @entity77 — who they knocked out of the @entity229 — beckons before @entity334 head to the @entity335 on monday week			0
if they come through this period unscathed , their claims will be taken more seriously and i hope they do			0
@entity305 have been the story of the season and it is remarkable they are up there after losing so many players and changing their manager			0
i just wonder , however , whether the depth of their squad will count against them			0
more will become apparent in the next 10 days			0
@entity350 here to @entity353 's facebook page .			0

@entity2 's form has been scrutinised *extensively* this season
he has not reached the same levels as last season
but @entity2 would be the first name on the teamsheet in a major final
match against @entity31 is 16th anniversary of @entity2 's first @entity18 game
he has to be able to end his @entity18 career on a high
