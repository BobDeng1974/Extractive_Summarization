by @entity0 in one small swoop , @entity2 architect @entity1 has opted out of paying rent or even a mortgage with her perfectly formed ' @entity6 ' - that cost her only $ 11,416.16 and which she broke her back building			1
finding herself divorced , unemployed and losing her home to foreclosure two years ago , the @entity12 resident enlisted the help of her dad and later her boyfriend to start building her 196 - square - foot dream home			1
the house which is built atop a flatbed trailer - made complete with sustainable materials - has the unlikely boast of its $ 2,000 compost toilet being the most expensive amenity or appliance in the whole cute build			2
' it did n't occur to me that it had been done before -- building a tiny house just made sense for me and for my situation , in every way , ' she told the @entity44 in 2011			1
home : @entity1 began construction of the property in december 2011 and has plowed $ 11,000 of her own money into the tiny home comforts : the kitchen is powered by gas and the home is currently hooked up to the power grid - but soon @entity33 wants that to change creating her plans for the house from scratch , taking influence from other tiny home residents , @entity33 invested $ 10,000 initially in her new home			1
inside the cozy home , every modern amenity needed is available including lighting which she wired herself , a kitchen area , and a working bathroom			2

' the steps leading to my bed will have drawers , the space above my pantry is sunken to have storage , behind my fridge is more storage , i have built in book shelves and i have plenty of cupboards and space under my bed for storage			0
room to move : @entity33 's bed is above her cupboards which is just behind her living room to the rear of her kitchen creating her plans for the house from scratch , taking influence from other tiny home residents , @entity33 invested $ 10,000 initially in her new home			1
' i have opted to leave open shelving in the kitchen to make it feel ‘ bigger ’ and more open but will be using shelving that maximizes the amount of storage space available			0
' her worst injury during the construction process was breaking her back falling off the roof - an injury which left her needing crutches for weeks			0
declaring that she will miss baths the most , her most pressing concern now is moving her tiny house to a permanent berth			2
