they might be fresh - faced and bright - eyed but when it comes to achieving their dancing dreams , girls will stop at nothing			2
and neither , it seems , will their mothers			2
now their antics are to appear on the small screen with the launch of a new reality series that follows a group of @entity13 mothers and their dancing daughters as they battle it out for @entity16 glory			1
but while the girls ' rivalries are ( generally ) limited to the dancefloor , their mothers are a different story entirely			2
from catfights ( ' it 's like @entity24 out there , ' exclaims dance teacher @entity27 at one stage ) to putting the kibosh on the competition , three ' dance mums ' reveal why they 'll stop at nothing in their battle to see their child succeed			1
' i will do whatever it takes to help @entity46 achieve her dreams , ' she says , steely determination glinting in her eyes			2
' she puts so much in and gives up so much			2
' @entity60 , who also has a son , @entity66 , got her daughter 's career off to an early start , when she enrolled her in a baby ballet class when she was just three years old			1
' she loved putting her little tutu on and ballet shoes , ' remembers her mother , fondly			2
' she was always so excited every saturday morning			2
stars of the show : dance teacher and former @entity77 star @entity27 surrounded by her young charges ' @entity46 loves to dance , ' she adds			1
' she never stops - she dances at home , in school ... she does n't walk down the street , she dances down it			0
' but while @entity60 has big ambitions for her daughter , she says the competitive world of dance mothers can sometimes be a bit too much			1
' there is real competitiveness in the dance world , ' she reveals			1
' i do think competition is healthy and it makes @entity46 work harder to achieve her goals and get results but there are some mums out there that can take it to the extreme			2
not , she hastens to add , that she ever has			0
' i would say the most outrageous thing i have ever done to boost @entity46 's chances is to be a part of @entity104 , ' she chuckles			1
' i 've never done anything like this before			0
being on television frightens the life out of me and it was n't for @entity46 's determination , i do n't think i could have done it			0
' @entity111 plans : @entity60 and daughter @entity46 , eight , ( left ) and @entity113 with daughter @entity114 , nine @entity115 , 31 daughter : @entity114 , nine ambition : for @entity114 to be ' the next @entity27 ' fight potential : nine - in part due to her friendship with the fiery @entity42 tall , blonde and pretty , @entity113 looks every inch the glamorous yummy mummy			1
but this mother - of - five has more on her mind than making cupcakes			0
a former dance wannabe herself , @entity113 admits that she lives vicariously through daughter @entity114 , nine , and says her little star - in - the - making has the talent to make it to the top			1
' i want to see @entity114 be on stage and win trophies in the dance competitions , ' she says			2
' a career in the @entity16 one day ... that ’s my biggest hope for my daughter			0
' like @entity60 , she readily admits to finding the dance world a competitive place and also says that there 's little she would n't do for her daughter - even if that means getting involved in an argument with @entity114 's dance teacher , former @entity77 actress , @entity27			1
' we do go against @entity27 ’s rules at times , ' she confesses , before adding : ' actually , it ’s not the other mums that go against @entity154 ’s rules , it ’s me			1
fight ! @entity41 and best friend @entity156 are n't shy of putting their opinions to dance teacher @entity27 paying attention : the mums keep a close eye on proceedings as @entity27 gets a class underway ' it ’s never the mums , they ’re very good , lovely mums – it ’s me			1
i do n’t always agree with what @entity27 has to say to the kids			1
' do n’t get me wrong , she ’s a brilliant teacher			0
i do love her too , she ’s done everything for my daughter but there are times we do n’t agree and there are times when we do agree			0
' it ’s definitely a love / hate relationship between us			0
' unsurprisingly , the antics of @entity113 and best friend @entity156 make for excellent tv , with @entity181 , in one scene , left squawking indignantly at what she sees as the pair 's lack of respect			1
' the disrespect that that they have is just unbelievable , ' she fumes			0
' @entity189 [ @entity42 's daughter ] is hysterically crying , while @entity42 is screaming at me like a docker			0
battling it out : danielle with her best friend @entity156 , both of whom know how to ruffle feathers ' to be honest , i do n't care if i see her ever again ! ' despite her best efforts to wind up @entity181 , @entity113 says everything she does is designed to give her daughter 's career a boost			1
' i want her to become one of the best dancers in the world and go on the @entity16 or to tv , ' she says			0
' i ’m hoping that people will recognise her and that she will become well known			0
i do n’t want to be on this show and then see it just slip away and no one knows who @entity212 is			0
' @entity214 pupil : @entity37 is mother to @entity27 's star pupil , @entity215 @entity216 , 44 daughter : @entity215 , 13 ambition : for @entity215 to be happy fight potential : six - as the mother of the show 's best dancer , @entity39 attracts a lot of jealous comments of all the mothers to appear on @entity104 , @entity37 is the gentlest and least controversial			1
but when you 're the mother of the star dancer , taking a more laissez faire approach to dancing is easy - as @entity37 is all too well aware			1
' my hopes for @entity233 is for her to lead a happy , healthy life and enjoy what she does best which is dancing , ' she beams			0
' @entity233 has done a lot of television work in the past : she ’s been on @entity240 , danced in front of the royal family , has been a special guest at the @entity244 and she ’s star billed at the @entity245			0
' @entity233 , it seems , is one child who does n't need any extra help from her mother , although that has n't stopped @entity37 from pulling off the odd stunt in a bid to boost her career			1
' she represented @entity253 in @entity254 this year and i jumped out of a plane to raise money to get her out there , ' says @entity37			1
' i ’d do anything for @entity233			0
@entity233 ’s talents are definitely what she needs to get to the top and not her mum being a lunatic			0
' i would do anything to help her out , but i do n't want to embarrass her so that 's where i 'd draw the line			0
' but while @entity37 has no plans to embarrass her daughter , the other mothers are a different story and she admits to being worried about the hostile reception she and her talented daughter occasionally get			1
' i get along with the other mums but them getting along with me ... that 's a different story			2
i would n’t connive against anybody , ' she adds , ' and i would hate it if someone did it to me or @entity233			0
she pauses and adds , ' i really hope no one will be nasty to @entity233 or myself			0

@entity37 , @entity113 and @entity60 are ' dance mums '
they will go to any *lengths* in order to see their daughters succeed
all three appear on new reality series @entity104 with @entity27
dance mums with @entity27 starts on monday at *9pm* on @entity292 156 / @entity293 *242* / @entity294 *490*
