how do you stop the world ’s fastest car ? with the world ’s strongest brakes , of course			1
the team behind the @entity7 have revealed how they intend to slow it from 1,000 miles ( 1,600 kilometres ) per hour to zero			1
the engineers based in @entity10 have been trying to find brakes that can withstand the huge temperatures and stresses of the vehicle - and they might now have the answer			1
the world record attempt will be made in @entity21 's @entity20 , a large patch of desert 2 miles ( 3 kilometres ) wide and 12 miles ( 19 kilometres ) long , in the coming years the @entity7 is a supersonic car in development , with the goal of setting a remarkable new world land speed record			1
a jet engine accelereates the car from rest to just over 300 miles ( 480 kilometres ) per hour in about 30 seconds			2
at this point the rocket is ignited , increasing accelerationto about 2g			0
maximum speed , 1,050 miles ( 1,690 kilometres ) per hour , will be reached after about 55 seconds			1
at this point the parachute and air brakes will be deployed , slowing the car to 160 miles ( 260 kilometres ) per hour with a deceleration of 3g			1
it is here that the world ’s strongest brakes , made from steel rotors , will then be applied , slowing the wheels from 10,000 revolutions per minute down to zero			1
the @entity18 project , based in @entity10 , hopes to break 1,000 miles ( 1,600 km ) per hour in the coming years with former @entity47 pilot @entity46 at the ‘ wheel ’			2
to get to that speed requires extraordinary power , but figuring out how to then stop the thin steel wheels has posed a problem			2
after the ‘ car ’ reaches its top speed , air brakes and parachutes will slow it to 160 miles ( 260 kilometres ) per hour			1
breaking to this speed is done at a constant @entity60 - equivalent to going from 60 miles ( 95 kilometres ) per hour in a normal car to zero in one second - for 20 seconds			0
this last stint to zero is where the problem lies , however			0
even at this speed the cars wheels are still spinning 10,000 times per minute			0
the @entity7 ( pictured ) is a @entity18 attempt to become the first car in the world to break 1,000 miles ( 1,600 kilometres ) per hour , breaking the world land speed record in the process			1
the vehicle is currently under development with the groundbreaking run scheduled for some time in the next few years the @entity7 stands for ‘ @entity76 ’ , because the @entity7 will be going faster than the speed of sound			1
the vehicle has four wheels and is powered by both a jet and rocket			2
it is designed to go over 1,000 miles ( 1,600 kilometres ) per hour			0
the slender body , 46 feet ( 14 metres ) long , keeps the entire vehicle aerodynamic			0
it weighs just over seven tonnes and the engines will produce more than 135,000 horsepower			0
that ’s more than six times the power of all the cars on a formula 1 starting grid put together			0
in the coming years the vehicle will begin test runs at lower speeds before attempting to set a new land speed record			1
attempts to use carbon rotors from a jet fighter in the form of car - like disc brakes shattered at speeds of just half this , so the team needed a new approach			0
instead , they switched to steel rotors from brake manufacturer @entity106			0
in tests these proved much more promising , withstanding temperatures of up to 850 ° @entity111 )			0
they even survived to such an extent that they can be used again			0
the next step will be to test these brakes out at the full 10,000rpm that will be experienced			0
but hopes are high that they could be the solution to bring the @entity7 safely to a halt			2
the current land speed record stands at 763.035 miles ( 1,227.985 kilometres ) per hour , set by former @entity47 pilot @entity46 ( who will also drive the @entity7 ) back in 1997 in the @entity123			1
the @entity7 will beat this record by some distance if it is successful			2
it will take the vehicle 55 seconds to accelerate to its top speed of @entity129 ( 1,600kph ) , where a mile will be covered in just 3.6 seconds , and at this speed the drag on the car will be 20 tonnes			1
the brakes shown here might be the answer to helping slow the car from these tremendous speeds			0

@entity10 engineers behind @entity7 have revealed how it will stop
the vehicle is set to break the world land speed record in a few years
the jet and rocket powered vehicle will reach 1,000mph in 55 seconds
it will then use a parachute and air brakes to slow down to 160mph
the world 's strongest brakes will then bring it completely to a halt
