‘ most of our constituents simply believe marriage is a unique institution that forms the bedrock of society and should be left as it is			2
‘ millions of people with marriage certificates imprinted “ @entity112 ” are entitled to ask what right anyone has to redefine their own marriages over their heads			0
’ signatories of the letter included @entity30 , the former education minister whose attempt to extend civil partnerships to straight couples was voted down , @entity32 , the former farming minister sir @entity108 , the former defence minister			0
sir @entity108 told the @entity114 : ‘ we are doing a really good job on the economy and @entity117 and cutting immigration but this is being obscured by this obsession with a massive social change that has no mandate			0
‘ i can not understand why the prime minister is hell - bent on driving through this through			0
‘ it is gratuitously disrespectful to the party and the country			0

late night : the @entity9 is due to vote on same sex weddings on monday night , but it could be delayed until 2am @entity134 , a ministerial aide who signed the letter , said : ‘ the manner of the process of this bill as much as the substance has been causing great concern			1
’ he added that while he was not personally coerced by the whips , ‘ i understand some colleagues may have felt the pressure from the prime minister and ministers about the impact on their careers			0
’ @entity149 and @entity150 had also publicly urged @entity25 mps to back the legislation			1
other mps to sign the letter include @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160			2
mr @entity160 said : ‘ my main issue is that there was not sufficient scrutiny of the @entity50 , and there was no mandate			0
it was n’t in the @entity169 , it was n’t in the manifesto , it was n’t in the @entity170			0
it is right that the @entity9 have the opportunity to vote on this			0
’ mps said that the legislation was railroaded through , with backbenchers given just four minutes for speeches at second reading while the committee put in charge of scrutinising the bill had 15 mps in favour of gay marriage and four against			2
however , the conservative party strongly denied issuing threats to mps who did not fall into line			0
a @entity25 source said : ‘ @entity188 was strictly neutral and left it to the advocates on either side of the arguments to put forward their case			2
’ @entity56 has said he is ‘ proud ’ of the @entity50 going through its third reading in the @entity42 last week			1
polls show that the public is broadly supportive of extending the right to marry to same sex couples			0
