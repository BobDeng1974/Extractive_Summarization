by @entity0 we 're taught to stay away from the bedrooms of our exes at all costs , and frequently reminded that nothing that goes on in there post-breakup can ever be a good thing for our mental well - being			0
but received wisdom of this ilk is being shattered by new findings suggesting that ' ex-sex ' can , in some cases , be a good idea			2

sex with a former lover can ease the pain of the split , says new research conducted at the @entity28 and published in the journal of @entity30 and clinical psychology in a recent study published in the @entity29 , researchers at the @entity28 examined a group of 137 recently divorced adults and asked how many had had the occasional post-conjugal visit after their divorce papers had been signed			1

partners who had n't accepted the break - up found the intimate encounters actually helped lessen the pain of divorce			2
we 're always taught that sex with an ex is an emotional minefield , but new research suggests it could actually help partners having difficulty coming to terms with a break - up meanwhile , partners who had accepted the break - up found sex made no difference at all to how they dealt with it , indicating that ' ex-sex ' may not be quite as emotionally detrimental as we had previously thought , and that it can , in fact , have benefits for those who are not - quite over their relationship			2
psychologists believe that break - ups can leave us with attachment needs that go unfulfilled , and that sex with an ex helps to provide some sense of security , and at least partial fulfillment of those needs			2
