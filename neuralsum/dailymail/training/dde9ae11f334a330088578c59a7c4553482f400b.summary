drinking sugary sports drinks and following a high carbohydrate diet has left many elite athletes with dental health so bad it affects their performance , researchers have found			1
they say tooth decay affects upto 75 % of elite athletes , and a third of medical problems at the @entity11 were dental			1
they also say that athletes were more likely to suffer eating disorders as they tried to control their weight			0
do n't drink it ! sugary drinks have become a key part of sports training - but have left many athletes with major dental problems , it has been revealed			1
diet is not the only culprit , says the research			0
it found there is little in the way of education or encouragement to help athletes appreciate the importance of good dental health on their training and performance			1
researchers looked at published evidence and data from the @entity11			2
it found : tooth decay affected 15 - 75 % of athletes ; moderate to severe gum disease up to 15 % ; enamel erosion 36 - 85 % ; and pericoronitis / impacted molars 5 - 39 %			1
damage caused by trauma was reported by between 14 - 57 % of athletes in high risk sports			1
athletes from rich countries were no less likely to be affected than those from poor countries , the data showed			0
dental health of athletes was on a par with that of non-athletes living in deprived communities			1
unsurprisingly , up to two thirds of those who had sustained trauma to their teeth said that this had adversely affected them			0
but up to 40 % said that their dental health ' bothered ' them or affected their quality of life , while between one in 20 and one in five said that it had affected their performance			1
the @entity70 , which draws on a comprehensive review of the published evidence and a recent symposium on the lessons of the @entity11 , is intended as a call to action			0
the @entity81 and @entity82 authors , all experts in dental health and sport and exercise medicine , point out that dental consultations accounted for almost a third of all medical visits at @entity11 , and that demand has continued to increase at subsequent major competitive events			1
eating disorders are also likely to be a factor , particularly in sports , such as boxing , horse riding , gymnastics , and long distance running , where body weight , composition , and aesthetics are crucial			0
experts say the problems must be addressed			0
' oral health could be an easy win for athletes , as the oral conditions that can affect performance are all easily preventable , ' said professor @entity105 of the @entity106 ' professional athletes and their teams spend a lot of time and money on ways to marginally improving performance , as this can make all the difference in elite sports			1
' simple strategies to prevent oral health problems can offer marginal performance gains that require little to no additional time or money			2
' things like better tooth brushing techniques and higher fluoride toothpastes could prevent the toothache and associated sleeping and training difficulties that can make the crucial difference between gold and silver			0
' there is a wealth of published evidence to show the impact of poor dental health on wellbeing , say the authors			1
' with clear psychosocial impacts of oral health , it would be surprising if training and performance were not affected in those athletes with poor oral health , ' they write			2
and this could be especially important in competition , where marginal gains ... or losses can make all the difference , they say			0
the intense dietary and training pressures on athletes could put them at high risk of oral health problems for many reasons , the team say			2
researchers looked at published evidence and data from the @entity11			2
researchers say water is a far better option for athletes saliva helps to protect teeth from decay and erosion , so dehydration and drying of the mouth could increase the risk of oral health problems			2
the amount of energy that athletes need for training often means they have high - carbohydrate diets and regularly use sugary , acidic energy drinks			1
these may contribute to decay and erosion in athletes ' teeth			0
' we do not want to demonise energy drinks and are not saying that athletes should n't be using them , ' says professor @entity105			0
' however , people should be aware of the risks to oral health and can take simple measures to mitigate these			0
' for example , water or hypotonic drinks are likely to be more suitable for simple hydration , and spit do n't rinse after tooth brushing			0
' for sports where athletes need a lot of energy drinks , high fluoride toothpastes and mouthrinses should be seriously considered			2

researchers found athletes suffered poor dental health which impacted performance
high carbohydrate diet and acidic sports drinks *combined* with poor dental care to blame
report found dental health of athletes was ' on a par with that of non-athletes living in deprived communities '
researchers *analysed* medical records from @entity11 - and found a third were dental problems
