from diets to exercise regimes or hunting for new jobs , the intention is often there - but in reality , most vows soon fall by the wayside			0
not so for one woman though - who at the start of 2011 vowed to carry out a good deed for every single day of the coming year			1

' i did n't realise when i made the resolution that @entity15 what i was taking on , ' she says in the epilogue to her book			0
' i 'd made resolutions before ... but the idea of doing one good deed a day morphed into something else again			1
' this year made me question what a good life is , how we give our lives meaning , and what it is to love			2
' it also taught me that people do n't always want the good you want to do , and that doing good - believe you me - is harder than it looks			1
' @entity67 goes onto say that the year of doing good is really an admission of her own failings			2
' my parents are saints , and it is tough being the parents of saints , ' she jokes			0
' people feel sorry for the children of murderers , because they think it must be hard worrying whether you 've inherited a genetic predisposition to kill as well as those long - lobed ears			2
' it is worse when you 're brought up by those who are good			2
' she calls 2011 the year that for her part , she ' tried to be good '			1
' when i ca n't remember something by name or that shoes should match , i know i 'll still remember these years , and that for a year at least , i tried to be good , ' she writes			2

after seeing all the good that her parents and other people had done , she wanted 2011 to be the year of her doing good			1
reflecting on her past year , @entity0 from @entity112 , @entity113 , humorously concluded there were both good and bad things			1
one such bad thing , she writes , is : ' i am still writing a bloody novel , and everyone who reads it says it is pants			0
' charitable : @entity0 threw herself into plenty of charity work too and even started a jam jar collection where she and others raised £ 26,000 @entity0 's comical tone continues throughout the book and has been highly commended by critics and readers alike			1
she even makes tongue - in - cheek digs at her husband throughout the book , writing : ' my other @entity15 's resolution is to stay married			2
if at all possible '			0
each chapter is dedicated to a resolution and they range from tidying a vase of flowers that had fallen over at a child 's grave to giving the @entity142 some blooms when she visited a nearby town			2
author : the journalist and author has already written two books , one of which was a bestseller her charity work was extensive too			0
she became a companion for cancer patients , taught mentally disabled children to write and worked with @entity156 packing shoe boxes			0
