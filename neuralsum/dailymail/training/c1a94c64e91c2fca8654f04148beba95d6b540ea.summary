president @entity16 has pledged that he will make a move on immigration reform this year			1
his original timetable called for a decision by the end of the summer			0
@entity22 have decried the plan as an ' amnesty ' for millions of illegal immigrants , including hundreds of thousands of unaccompanied minors who have come across the @entity7 - @entity29 border this year			1
the draft came complete with photos of what the finished cards will look like			0

either way , the online draft explains that ' @entity82 requires card consumables for the production of @entity0 ' @entity97 ( @entity98 ) and @entity99 ( @entity99 ) cards			1
