@entity1 coach @entity0 said he had no plans to jump ship after his side dropped down to last place in the @entity6 following their 2 - 0 defeat by @entity8 on sunday			1
it is the first time since 2007 - 8 that @entity1 , @entity6 champions in 2011 and both league and @entity12 winners in 2012 , have been in bottom place but @entity0 , who also led the club to the @entity16 final only 18 months ago , said they were ready to pick themselves up again			1
asked if he had any thoughts of leaving , @entity0 told @entity19 : ' i can understand journalists thinking about something like that but there is no such trend ( within the club )			2
i see myself as being responsible			0
“ but as long as nobody comes and says ‘ we have someone who makes it better ’ then i can not go			0
i am not in the way but i can not go before there is a better solution			0
this is a big responsibility and i accept it			0
” @entity1 , who have already qualified for the @entity16 knockout stage , have now lost eight of their 13 league games this season			1
the @entity1 team face their supporters following their 2 - 0 away loss to @entity8 with a leaky defence , a lack of goals and a string of injuries , including @entity63 and defenders @entity64 and @entity66 , @entity1 have won just one of their last 10 @entity6 games and have accumulated only 11 points			1
' we wanted dramatically to improve our situation today but we did not do it , ' said @entity0			2
' but we will keep on working at it			0
' @entity8 pounced on a @entity1 defensive error with @entity32 drilling in after five minutes			1
another even bigger defensive mix - up between @entity76 and keeper @entity77 allowed @entity33 to add another late on			2
@entity78 greets @entity0 before the @entity80 ' contest with @entity1 at the @entity81 in between , @entity1 missed more than half a dozen clear scoring chances , dominating the game for most of the time			1
' we suffered an early setback and that was painful			0
you could see it and feel it , ' @entity0 said			2
' now we face a major challenge			0
