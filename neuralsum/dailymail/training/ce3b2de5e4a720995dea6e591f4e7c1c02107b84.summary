the number you gave , there was no answer			0
' for somebody high risk , there was no support			1
' @entity0 was agitated and we were getting agitated because nobody was there			1
you should have already had that in place			0
i am just thinking about it to make it safer			0
' to me her mood was down but she tried to act normally as if everything as okay			0
' she was struggling and her mood just got low and i think the only people who could help her with the professionals			2
ms @entity0 's family have condemned @entity44 over its failure to have a messaging service ' we were out of our depth because that is not what we do			1
' you go to professionals and hopefully you think they are going to look after her			2
i just do not think she was on the right medication			0
' on the day she was sent home , even though she was high risk , she had to manage her own medication			1
she had to wean off one and increase another			0
' i feel as if she was neglected , a lack of care			2
' why she was not sectioned ? for somebody who tried two attempts in such a short space of time , why did you feel the need to let her go home ? ' the community nurses rang her but how can you see down a telephone ? ' earlier the @entity34 hearing was told ms @entity0 had suffered from depression since 1998 but since september 2013 her condition deteriorated and she made two suicide attempts			1
a month before her death she told mr @entity16 she had taken dozens of pills and was rushed to hospital			2

' dr @entity138 , a consultant psychiatrist for @entity44 , said ms @entity0 's medication had been switched due to a deterioration in her condition , but that she was not mentally ill enough to be sectioned under the @entity141			1
he said : ' there was a risk , but toward the end of january @entity0 was firmly saying she wanted to be out of hospital			1
' she did have capacity - she was not suffering from confusion or memory loss which made her unable to understand the situation			1
' there was no doubt she suffered from depression and a risk of harming herself , however parties felt the risk could be managed in the community in part because she was compliant with her treatment , she took her medication and was willing to sit down and talk with the intensive home treatment team			1
' we also have a duty to use the least restrictive option			0
@entity0 expressed the view that being in the hospital was detrimental for her			2
' she clearly and firmly said that she wanted to be home			0
' i would say she did not have any immediate plans to harm herself but there remained a large concern about her depression and impulsivity			0
' the intensive home care treatment team grade or rate patients they are seeing according to how concerned they are			0
' she was rated as a red which is the highest level of concern			0
but it was the opinion of doctors and nurses that the level of risk was not such that such immediate action be taken			0
' @entity183 , who works for the @entity184 told the inquest : ' everybody felt there was a risk that she had had two previous suicide attempts and there was a concern but she would not have met the criteria			0
' she said the lack of response from the out of hours hotline as an ' oversight ' and an answer message service has been put in place			2
recording a verdict of suicide coroner @entity202 said : ' she did receive in that regard the best care from her doctors and they factored into the equation what they thought @entity0 wanted			2
' the family have raised concerns and certain issues and i am grateful the concerns have been acted open as far as the trust and hospital are concerned			0
' after the hearing mrs @entity48 added : ' we left @entity0 's care to the professionals and the outcome was fatal			1
' they are supposed to know what 's best but at the end of the day my sister died even though she is high risk			1
' everything seems to stop on a friday in adult health services			0
