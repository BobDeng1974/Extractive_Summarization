@entity1 manager @entity0 insists the focus has to be on getting the most out of @entity4 's loan spell before thoughts even turn to a permanent deal			1
the @entity8 winger has been one of the more impressive performers since moving to @entity10 in the winter transfer window			1
@entity4 , 28 , has just four more matches to impress as he is ineligible to play against his parent club on the final day of the season and @entity0 said that must be the priority for all concerned			1
@entity4 ( right ) has four games remaining of his loan spell at @entity1 from @entity8 @entity0 wants to get the most out of @entity4 in the time he has left at @entity10 @entity0 said discussions about @entity4 's future will come at the end of the @entity23 season ' @entity4 is enjoying his football and his contribution to the team has been significant , ' said the manager			1
' he has got four games left and all i want is for him to enjoy every single second of it and make sure he enjoys the experience as much as we have benefited from his talent			0
' then , at the end of the season , will be the moment to sit down			2
a loan is a loan and it means that we are looking for a successful outcome out of that			0
' then , when the loan finishes , you have got a three - way conversation to see where that will take us			0
' but the focus now is to see ' @entity45 ' enjoying his football in the next four games			0
' reports have linked @entity4 with a swap deal with @entity1 ' forward @entity51 come the summer , with the @entity54 international 's future at @entity10 uncertain after declaring in february he was looking for a new challenge			1
@entity51 scored on his first start since early march with the only goal against @entity58 and @entity0 is looking for the 27 - year - old to finish the season strongly			2
' @entity51 is a special player for us , ' @entity0 told evertontv			2
' he brings a goalscoring threat that is so important in football			0
it 's good to see that @entity51 is well over his injury now and can challenge for a place in the team			0
@entity0 also praised the attacking talents of @entity51 ( right ) and rejected reports he could exit the club reports have linked @entity51 ( right ) with a switch to @entity8 with @entity4 signing with @entity1 permanently ' it 's great to have as many players like @entity51 fit and available because it gives you different opportunities to show a threat to the opposition			1
' i 'm looking forward to seeing how strong @entity51 can finish the season now			0
