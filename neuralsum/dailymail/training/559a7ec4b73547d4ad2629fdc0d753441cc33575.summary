and @entity16 mp @entity15 , chairman of the defence select committee , asked armed forces minister @entity18 to look at a @entity4 company within the reserves ‘ as a starting point ’			1
heritage : @entity23 @entity4 soldiers			2
supporters say soldiers should be given a regiment to take pride in mr @entity18 said he believes the plan – which was dropped by the @entity29 in 2007 for fear of being branded racist – ‘ may well have merit ’			1
and the @entity16 frontbencher went on to reveal that the suggestion was being ‘ looked at ’ , saying the proposed regiment would inherit many ‘ proud traditions of @entity4 regiments ’ from the @entity35 ’s past			2
mr @entity8 told him : ‘ you will be aware of the extraordinary gallant and distinguished service by @entity4 to this country down the generations			2
‘ would you not agree with me that it ’s high time to do away with the political correctness which infects some of this thinking and actually raise a @entity4 regiment to serve in the country and make up a very serious gap in our @entity48 ? ’ in 2007 defence chiefs abandoned plans to create a regiment of @entity5 @entity4 after talks with the @entity54			1
tradition : the @entity4 guard , from 5th battalion of the 14th @entity58 , pictured in @entity59 @entity4 leaders informed recruitment officers that they could easily find enough volunteers to form a 700 - strong regiment			1

leaders of @entity5 ’s 500,000 @entity4 were supportive of the idea of a new regiment , arguing that it would be no different from the @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 or the @entity78 , which recruits exclusively from @entity79 and which is regarded as a model infantry regiment			1
support : former defence minister sir @entity8 backed the idea ( file photo ) the decision to shelve the plans was at the time criticised by politicians , members of the @entity4 community and soldiers , who claimed that the @entity35 had fallen victim to political correctness			1
@entity92 , the general secretary of the @entity93 in @entity95 ’s @entity94 , west @entity96 , said : ‘ the @entity4 have a long and distinguished heritage of serving with the @entity35			0
‘ i know there are many , many @entity4 who would join up and would serve wherever required			0
' but if you want to get them in large numbers they need their own regiment , something they would take a huge amount of pride in			0
‘ they would regard it as very prestigious			0
it is a shame that it now looks as though it will never happen			0
’ prince @entity109 has previously expressed an interest in the creation of dedicated units to boost the number of people from ethnic minorities in the services and to harness the military tradition of the @entity4 faith in particular			2
the move comes after the @entity29 revealed plans to try and recruit more muslims and ethnic minorities into the army after the rise of @entity125 and massacre in @entity127			0
troops have posted pamphlets on @entity5 military values through the doors of @entity133 religious schools have been instructed to take part in integration projects in a bid to boost numbers .			0
