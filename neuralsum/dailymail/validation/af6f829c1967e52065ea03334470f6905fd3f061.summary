@entity1 member states have blocked plans to ban so - called ‘ roaming ’ charges for people using data on their smartphones and tablet devices			1
most mobile companies slap the sky - high fees on people ’s bills whenever they use their email , search the web , or use an online map to navigate , whilst they are overseas			1
customers can pay a small amount for special roaming packages , but people who fail to do this face eye - watering charges , even if they have used their mobile phone sparingly			1
in some cases , customers have racked up thousands of pounds just by surfing the web on their mobiles whilst on holiday			0
the @entity40 had promised to axe the controversial fees by the end of 2015			1
however , the @entity1 member states voted against that plan , so they will now remain in place until at least 2018 , and could stay far into the future			2
the move has sparked outrage amongst @entity48			1
@entity49 , leader of the @entity50 , said he would fight ‘ vigourously ’ to end roaming charges this year , and that ‘ @entity1 member states should hang their heads in shame ’			1
@entity55 , the @entity40 's former digital tsar first called for a ban on roaming charges in 2013			0
the move was hugely unpopular with mobile operator , who rely on roaming charges to fatten the industry ’s profits			2
they argue that the roaming charges are necessary to cover the costs that they are charged by foreign operators for carrying data across their networks			0
angered : @entity49 , leader of the @entity50 , said he would fight ‘ vigourously ’ to end roaming charges however , all mobile phone operators charge each other for this service , meaning that the whole industry is effectively taxing customers for using their phones overseas , and passing the money between them			1
now @entity80 ’ successors have rowed back on her policy , and said that mobile phone companies need more time to deal with the hole that a ban on roaming charges would put in their profits			2
instead , they have suggested that people using their mobile phones abroad should be given a discount on a small amount of roaming , and face standard roaming charges on whatever else they use			2
at a meeting in @entity48 , they said they would review the situation in 2018 to see if the market had come up with foreign roaming packages that offer customers better value for money			0
however , there is no guarantee that they would intervene , even at that point			0
@entity107 , a telecoms analyst at @entity108 , said : ‘ they were going to be abolished but that has been pushed back more or less indefinitely			0
customers are now relying on the market to deliver			0
’ a few mobile phone companies have taken steps to reduce so - called ‘ bill shock ’ for customers returning home from overseas			1
@entity118 invites customers to pay for a ‘ passport ’ whenever they travel overseas , whilst @entity121 allows users to use the internet , and make as many texts and calls as they like , when they visit certain countries , as part of its ‘ @entity129 ’ package .			0
