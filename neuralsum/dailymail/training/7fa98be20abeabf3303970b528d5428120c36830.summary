avoid giving cancer patients chocolates and sweets - there are so many other wonderful presents in the second part of her no - nonsense guide to thriving with cancer , @entity4 explains how to cope with chemotherapy – and why sweet treats are the last thing you should give a patient ... what gift do you give a woman with cancer ? while a well - thought - out present will be hugely appreciated , there are plenty of things to avoid , too			1
once , while i was in hospital , a friend brought me cupcakes			0
they were beautiful little things , and i just could n’t restrain myself			2
but even before my diagnosis with stage four , incurable breast cancer in 2011 , i tried to stick to a diet free from processed foods and sugar			1
other friends gave me pyjamas , bed socks , a beautiful soft poncho , organic body creams , bath oils and lavender eyes masks			1
there are so many wonderful , helpful things out there , so you do n’t need to give chocolates , sweets or champagne			2
fuel for the fight i believe that during cancer treatment , when your immune system is being battered by the disease and the toxic drugs used to kill it , it ’s even more important not to consume things that have been altered with synthetic chemicals and preservatives			1
and that includes sugar - laden ‘ treats ’			2
and although i never stopped exercising , when you ’re fatigued during chemo and radiotherapy , you simply ca n’t do it with as much vigour			1
i was often limited to some gentle stretching in my room , but anything is better than nothing			2
the aim is to keep your circulation going as this helps recovery			0
going back to those cupcakes , i enjoyed every moment of eating them			0
you do have to allow yourself to break the rules occasionally			0
i live by the 80/20 rule : if you get it rigorously right most of the time , eating only fresh , unprocessed food and produce – vegetables , fish , poultry , just a little red meat and no added sugar – you can have moments where you let go			1
when your immune system is being battered by the disease , it ’s even more important not to consume things that have been altered with synthetic chemicals and preservatives			1
and that includes sugar - laden ‘ treats ’ @entity90 … in comfort chemotherapy is the use of medicines to kill or slow the growth of rapidly multiplying cancer cells			1
once the medicines enter the bloodstream , they travel to all parts of the body in order to reach cancer cells that may have spread beyond the primary source			1
you will have heard about the sickness , nausea and hair loss that often accompany chemotherapy , but other side effects may include dry eyes , coldness , heartburn , a sore mouth , tingling hands and feet , and memory loss			1
here ’s how i dealt with some of the side effects from my treatment : it is vitally important that you rest while undergoing treatment - you have to give in to fatigue rest is best by the time i was into radiotherapy , i had endured eight operations , chemotherapy , and much more			1
i wrongly assumed i could do normal things , and would then find myself in a supermarket or at a children ’s sports match in a desperate state			2
my point is you have to give in to fatigue			0
rest ! rest ! rest ! and accept ! accept ! accept ! to do this , you must feel comfortable delegating tasks to friends and family			0
if you are anything like me , it ’s not easy			2
radiotherapy uses high levels of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing and dividing , while minimising damage to healthy cells			1
it is given to reduce your risk of local recurrence of the cancer and generally treatments start several weeks after surgery			1
it is very cold in the radiotherapy treatment rooms , which is necessary to keep these incredible machines cool			1
bring a scarf , woolly socks and a hat			0
on the plus side , you feel nothing during the actual treatment , which lasts only a few minutes			0
care for your skin moisturise your skin constantly but only use the ones that your clinic gives or authorises you to use in the area exposed to radiation , your skin may become red , swollen , itchy , warm and sensitive , as if you have nasty sunburn			0
it may peel or become moist and tender			0
gently cleanse the treated area using lukewarm water			0
i used to put moisturiser on first to act as a barrier cream and then get in the bath or shower			1
do not submerge the treated area in the bath			0
and if you are showering , let the water trickle over it as little as possible			0
do n’t rub your skin			1
@entity186 it dry with a soft towel instead or use a hairdryer on a cool setting			0
moisturise your skin constantly ( i did it about three or four times a day )			1
only use the ones that your clinic gives or authorises you to use , because they must not contain aluminium or other chemicals			0
do n’t apply cosmetics , shaving lotions , perfumes or deodorants on the treated area , and use only an electric razor if you need to shave that part of your body			2
make sure your baths are not too hot			0
i found this difficult as i was always freezing after treatments and longed for a hot , long soak			0
avoid tight - fitting clothes that might irritate your skin , and keep the treated area out of direct sunlight			2
always wear a very high factor sunblock , even after your course of treatment has finished .			0

@entity213 was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011 aged *47*
mother - of - three *writes* about her experience during and after chemo
here she gives *advice* to cancer *sufferers* on dos and dont *'s*
it is important to see a *dentist* before you start treatment to make sure your mouth is healthy . chemotherapy *affects* the cells that line the mouth , so it becomes very dry . any ***infection*** can run rife , meaning treatment must be stopped . it ’s therefore important to head off any potential *problems* .
as chemo lowers the immune system , *hygiene* is very important . i travel everywhere with *antibacterial* hand gel . anyone who had a cold was n’t allowed to come near me as even a minor ***infection*** could have interrupted my treatment .
i also suffered from dry eyes and even *blepharitis* – ***infection*** in the *eyelids* linked to dry eyes . moisturising *sterile* eye drops are hugely relieving and can help *protect* against this .
as my skin got *terribly* dry , i *massaged* in facial oils every night and used tinted @entity258 moisturiser during the day . i used to *slather* myself with body , hand , face and foot cream – always with *natural* products . i found that lots of bath oil helped too . this sounds *laborious* but it made a huge *difference* to my comfort .
cancer is my *teacher* , by @entity4 , is *published* by @entity273 , priced *£* *12.99* . you can order your copy at *mailbookshop.co.uk* , where *p&p* is free for a limited time only .
