' with the facts in front of me now , i see it all with sickening clarity			0
' sometimes at night , it replays in my head – a dark twist on @entity48 tumbling down the rabbit hole			0
' an emergency fire crew managed to harness @entity9 to safety and she was rushed to @entity52 in @entity53 in a helicopter			1

the doctors said ' i guess someone up there was looking out for her ' @entity9 's mother , @entity24 , and father , @entity27 , believe their daughter , saying she ' has no interest in melodrama ' doctors told her relieved parents : ' i guess someone up there was looking out for her			1
' ' the @entity79 doc told us the one thing we were n't expecting to hear , ' her mother said			0

i sat in @entity5 ' lap. ' ' i saw in @entity95 's eyes the conscious decision to confide in us , ' @entity24 said			1
' there was no drama , she was n't playing either			0
' this was n't like one of her long , spun - out recaps of a funny dream or movie she 'd seen			2

doctors advised she could begin to come off the antibiotics she had been taking for years			0
instead of taking ten different types of medication throughout the day , she only needed three , and the painkillers that were prescribed ' as and when she needed them ' were not required at all			0
previously , @entity9 's medication meant she had to have a liquid diet or stick to soft , bland food – but now , she can happily tuck into pizzas and @entity138 's happy meals			1
the family have gone more than a year without a single visit to the doctor			2
' i ca n't explain what happened to her physically while she was in that tree , ' said her father @entity27			0
