some people like to run with a dog as a companion , while others use a ‘ smart ’ accessory to keep track of the progress they ’ve made			1
but now a team of researchers has devised a new jogging buddy - a drone that flies with you to keep you company			2
and they claim robotic companions could be used for a variety of other physical activities such as cycling , cross-country skiing and rowing			2
called @entity24 ( shown ) it is designed to float in front of jogger when they run			1
the technology could allow it to track the speed and direction of the runner			1
and it could be used for other sports like cycling and rowing the research , by the @entity36 in @entity22 , reported @entity38 , was presented at the @entity39 in @entity40			1
in their paper , the researchers explained how they asked 13 joggers to run for an average of 26 minutes with a drone - specifically a quadcopter - as a companion			1
the goal was to see if a drone could motivate a runner to keep their pace up , and provide a companion that helped them stay fit			1
in this experiment , the quadcopters were programmed to follow a set path and speed , which the joggers also followed			2
the drone was designed to fly 13ft ( four metres ) in front of the jogger at a height of 10ft ( three metres )			1
each participant was fitted with a @entity65 camera and , after finishing their run of between 15 and 40 minutes , gave their thoughts on having a robot companion			2
@entity69 said that they found it was a good ‘ pace keeper ’ , especially on straight sections of their run			0
technology has been developed where a drone could lock onto a pattern on a runner ’s shirt in order to track their speed and direction , although this has n't been implemented yet			1
however , the researchers said their ’s was ‘ the first system that has been successfully deployed in an outdoor setting			0
’ ‘ it forces you to go a certain pace , pushes you a bit further , ’ said one runner			0
‘ if i was running by myself , i think my pace would vary a bit more , this is a more set pace			0
' ultimately , it seemed that the runners felt a sense of ‘ peer pressure ’ similar to how one might feel if they were running with a human companion			2
in this experiment , the quadcopters were programmed to follow a set path , which the joggers also followed			0
however , technology has been developed where a drone could lock onto a pattern on a runner ’s shirt in order to track their speed and direction ( shown ) there were some concerns from the runners , though ; occasionally the quadcopter would deviate from its path , leading them to question their safety			1
and it also wobbled in the wind , which one runner likened to it having a personality of its own			0
one also noted that they ‘ felt a bit awkward with a camera on my head and jogging with a robot			0
’ but they added : ‘ i ’m jogging with a robot , and people think it ’s rad			0
’ the researchers think their study could help design flying robots that support joggers , and it could even be used for other sports as well such as cycling , cross-country skiing , rowing or even fun runs			1
some runners may have dogs as jogging companions now , but will be using robots in the future ? the team hope their research could inspire new ways to perform such activities in a cycling scenario , the researchers say the drone could create a draft , ‘ providing a psychological and maybe even physical boost			2
’ other drones could display encouraging messages to keep motivation high			0
‘ overall , our work aims to inspire other designers to utilise robotic systems to support exertion activities , ’ the researchers concluded			0
there 's no news yet on when - or if - this technology will be available to the public , though .			0

@entity22 researchers have tested their drone running companion
called @entity24 it is designed to float in front of jogger when they run
technology could allow it to track the speed and direction of the runner
and it could be used for other sports like cycling and rowing
