even among all the dastardly deeds @entity3 might have committed , there is one crime of which he never stood accused – he never harmed a goldfish			1
but five centuries on from the much - maligned monarch ’s reign , he has become embroiled in a row he could never have foreseen			0
the murder of the @entity13 in a modern - day interpretation of @entity16 ’s play has incurred the wrath of animal rights champions – after it was alleged a goldfish was injured during the performance			1
she reported the production to the @entity48 ( @entity49 ) , claiming the goldfish was ‘ ground up with the gravel and pushed up against the sides of the tank ’ as the actor ‘ thrashed around wildly ’			1
@entity49 contacted director @entity55 to complain the life of the goldfish was being placed in peril of injury or death			2
campaign co-ordinator @entity61 asked him to stop using live fish for entertainment in what she described as an unsuitable environment			1
in a series of tweets , mr @entity55 responded by insisting : ‘ as a strict vegan , the safety & welfare of the goldfish in @entity3 has been my top priority			2
they are growing & flourishing			0
’ he added : ‘ no goldfish has been harmed or killed in @entity75 we ’ve followed very strict guidelines to ensure their well - being & happiness			0
’ the modern take on @entity16 's historical @entity3 has been playing on the @entity80 since july 1 eight goldfish are employed in rotated pairs to depict @entity13 being murdered in the tank , which then appears to fill with blood			1
@entity13 has earlier described a ‘ drowning ’ dream in which he sees fish gnawing at the bodies of shipwrecked men			2
in the original @entity16 play , @entity13 is stabbed and drowned in a butt of malmsey wine			1
history does not record if goldfish featured in the murder , but none is mentioned by the @entity16			0
@entity49 says in its letter to mr @entity55 that experts report fish to be ‘ intelligent , sensitive animals who feel pain just like humans do ’			0
they also possessed long - term memories and complex social structures			0
it concluded : ‘ taking them out of the production altogether is the only way to ensure their welfare and would in no way affect the success of the show itself			0
’ yesterday mr @entity55 agreed to withdraw the fish from the production , which opened on july 1 and is scheduled to run until september 27			0
he added in a statement that the goldfish were supplied by a reputable dealer and cared for under @entity120 - approved conditions to ensure no distress was caused to them			0
if only the same could have been said for the @entity13			0
@entity123 , the 1st @entity13 was @entity124 's brother and is a key character in @entity16 's play			1
in original versions , the play opens with @entity13 being framed for treason before he is arrested and taken to the @entity130			2
@entity22 ( pictured left alongside actress @entity131 ) , 43 , is playing the evil king at @entity41 's @entity40 in one scene , @entity13 recounts a nightmare of being pushed into the ocean and drowning - later on in the play he is attacked by assassins sent by @entity138 , the man who framed him , and is stabbed and drowned in a butt of wine			1
in the version - set in 1970s @entity144 and starring @entity22 - the butt of wine was ditched for an office fish tank in a modern twist on the gruesome murder .			1
