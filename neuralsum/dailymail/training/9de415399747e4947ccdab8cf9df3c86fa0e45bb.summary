by @entity0 published : 10:37 est , 3 december 2013 @entity2 : 18:42 est , 3 december 2013 jailed : @entity3 has been sentenced to prison for heroin possession a heroin addict has been condemned by a judge for abusing and dealing in drugs after his life was saved by an @entity11 heart transplant operation			1
@entity3 , 38 , was cleared for surgery by doctors even though his heart problems were caused by drug addiction			1
but instead of mending his ways , he responded by stepping up his criminal behaviour			2
@entity3 went back on heroin , became a dealer and committed 23 drugs offences in a seven - year period after his transplant			1
yesterday the case provoked outrage as transplant survivors questioned whether the drug addict should have been given his new heart above others on the waiting list			2
@entity3 was jailed for 18 months at @entity30 on monday			1
the recorder , @entity32 , passed sentence after hearing police found £ 430 worth of heroin as well as cannabis and valium tablets in his flat in @entity39 , @entity40 , last month			1
mr @entity32 told @entity3 : ‘ quite what an individual who has had a heart transplant is doing with these type of drugs defies explanation			1
’ @entity47 will be allowed to visit his hospital cardiologist from prison			2
he has refused to co-operate with probation workers who want him to quit drugs			1
the court heard details of his criminal history , mostly dating from after his transplant 12 years ago			2
@entity3 has 32 previous convictions , which include 23 drugs offences committed from 2006 onwards			1
he is no stranger to prison , having been jailed for two - and - a - half years in 2009 for supplying @entity60 drugs			1
his medical history means he can not be sentenced to do community work since the authorities are unable to get insurance for him			2
in 2001 , aged just 26 and already an addict , he had the heart transplant			2
it is understood that he needed the operation because his body had been severely damaged by drug use			2
his failure to seriously attempt to give up drugs meant the judge was left with little alternative to a prison sentence			1
as someone with a history of drug abuse he would have had to adhere to ‘ strict conditions ’ before being cleared by medical experts for a transplant			0
he would have had to convince doctors of his ability to kick the habit , an @entity11 spokesman said			0
however , there was anger yesterday about a £ 40,000 operation being given to a drug addict			0
@entity90 , 28 , whose daughter @entity91 underwent a heart transplant as a baby , said : ‘ i do n’t think he should have been given the heart in the first place			0
‘ that organ could have gone to someone else who could n’t help the fact they were ill and could have used the heart so much better			0
@entity91 did n’t choose to be in need of a new heart , neither do millions of people			0
' i think it ’s disrespectful to the donor , the donor ’s friends and family and to all of the medical staff who performed the operation and helped him recover			0
’ @entity113 , 67 , of @entity114 , @entity115 , suffered from a condition that caused her heart to swell and received the heart of a 17 - year - old boy in 2000			0
ill health : @entity3 , 38 , was previously given a heart transplant paid for by the @entity11 commenting on the case , she said : ‘ i think what this guy has done is absolutely awful			1
‘ he has been given this wonderful chance and he has abused it			0
there are so many people who really need a heart transplant and will die if they do not get one			0
' for him to take a heart transplant when there are so many other people waiting is just so selfish			0
how will the families feel of the person whose heart he inherited ? ’ @entity47 also appeared in court in february after being caught with £ 340 worth of heroin			1
police arrested him as he attempted to swallow evidence			0
the court heard he was dealing to pay for his daily fix and the recorder , @entity144 , let him off with a suspended sentence and a warning			2
he told @entity3 : ‘ if you continue to use heroin , not only will you spend time in prison , it will kill you			1
your body can not take it much longer			0
’ sentencing : @entity3 was jailed for 18 months at @entity30 , pictured , on monday but @entity3 was back in court on monday for sentence after pleading guilty to three charges of drug possession and possession of a knife in a public place			1
his barrister @entity160 told the court that his transplant was a result of the drug abuse and referred to his medical condition in an attempt to avoid a jail term			0
‘ he is a man of poor health , ’ he said			0
‘ you will see from his medical records that mr @entity3 is a heart transplant patient who requires medication and regular contact with medical services			1
all these matters are making him anxious about going into custody			0
’ mr @entity160 said his client was also worried about how his girlfriend , who is pregnant , would cope without him			0
he said @entity3 had used ‘ seven bags of heroin a day ’ at one time and was dealing to pay for his habit .			1

@entity3 , 38 , has continued to take heroin as well as dealing drugs
he has been jailed for 18 months after *racking* up more than 30 convictions
