by @entity0 a businessman has been awarded £ 6million of taxpayers ’ money after a court ruled he was wrongly arrested by the @entity5			1
entrepreneur @entity6 was questioned when the @entity5 carried out a dawn raid on his home in 2011			1
it was part of an inquiry into the collapse of @entity13 , one of three @entity16 banks to fold during the 2008 credit crunch			1
settlement : @entity6 , left , with brother @entity19 and sister @entity20 on board his yacht but after the investigation collapsed , a judicial review at the @entity24 quashed the search warrants and was highly critical of the @entity5 ’s conduct			1
now , in a final settlement , the @entity5 has agreed to pay mr @entity6 £ 3million to settle the case and a further £ 3million towards his legal costs within 21 days			1
however , the agency has yet to settle with mr @entity6 ’s younger brother @entity19 , who said last night he intends to pursue a £ 100million claim			1
the @entity35 - born brothers , who together are worth an estimated £ 850million , were seeking a record £ 300million in damages from the agency before yesterday ’s settlement with @entity6			1
@entity19 , 53 , said last night : ‘ i was unceremoniously arrested in a dawn raid on the morning of march 9 , 2011 , by the @entity41 , at the behest of the @entity5			2
‘ the media had been tipped off and were present before the police arrived to exercise the warrants			0
‘ i intend to continue to pursue this claim through the courts in order to right the wrongs that have been done			0
’ brothers : @entity35 - born @entity19 ( left ) and @entity6 are together worth an estimated £ 850million @entity6 , 57 , said : ‘ i am happy to accept this settlement from the @entity5 and bring to a close my disputes with them			1
‘ whilst i and my business have suffered serious and significant damage at the hands of the @entity5 , it has become increasingly apparent that the @entity5 ’s investigation was influenced by certain third parties , acting in their own commercial interests			0
‘ i have settled my case against the @entity5 and intend to focus my attentions on those other parties whom i consider are responsible			0
‘ however , i hope that the @entity5 has learned lessons from this sorry episode in its history and the serious errors which led to my investigation and arrest are never repeated			0
‘ i have maintained my innocence since day one and this settlement and apology that i have received from the @entity5 is total vindication for me			0
’ a judicial review at the @entity24 was highly critical of the @entity5 's ( above ) conduct @entity6 – who like his brother lives in @entity77 , @entity78 – had claimed he had been the victim of false imprisonment , trespass , misfeasance in public office and malicious prosecution			1
the @entity5 said in a statement that it was ‘ pleased ’ to settle the claim and admitted ‘ mistakes ’ had been made in the case			2
but a @entity90 spokesman said : ‘ this sorry episode has cost the taxpayers millions , but what ’s most galling is the fact that the @entity5 believes it ’s doing the public a favour by handing out bumper compensation payments			0
‘ the whole affair has been entirely avoidable , and those responsible must be held accountable			0
‘ this kind of waste can not be tolerated if @entity103 is to bring down its £ 1.3trillion debt mountain			0
’ @entity105 , the director of the @entity5 , said : ‘ i am pleased that we have been able to resolve this matter without the need for a costly trial			0
' the @entity5 deeply regrets the errors for which we were criticised by the @entity24 in july 2012			2
‘ on behalf of the @entity5 i apologise to mr @entity6 for what happened to him			1

@entity6 had borrowed £ 100million from the @entity16 bank shortly before its collapse			2
both he and his brother have always denied any wrongdoing .			0
