both parks have seen 80 % rise in visitor numbers since film was released by @entity5 reporter published : 10:16 est , 2 august 2012 updated : 02:14 est , 3 august 2012 a @entity7 national park has put up a Â£ 10,000 reward to anybody who can prove that it was not the inspiration behind @entity13 blockbuster @entity12			1
managers at @entity15 , @entity16 , claim their spectacular sandstone pillars were the inspiration for the ' @entity19 ' on @entity20 , the film 's densely forested moon setting			1
however , they already face a challenge from bitter rival @entity24 , the @entity26 in southern @entity28 province in eastern @entity7 , which claims it was the true source of the film			1
does the award for @entity12 inspiration go to @entity15 ... war of words : managers at @entity15 claim their spectacular sandstone pillars were clearly the inspiration for the ' @entity19 ' on @entity20 , the film 's densely forested moon setting ... or the @entity26 ? @entity24 's @entity37 in southern @entity28 province in eastern @entity7 strengthened their claim when the film 's director @entity40 said he had based the mountains on their site could it be ? rivals at the @entity46 beg to differ stunning : both parks have seen a rise in visitor numbers since the film was released as both claim to have been the source for @entity12 's @entity19 ( below ) and from the film : the @entity13 rendering of the mountains in @entity40 's blockbuster film @entity12 @entity15 spokesman @entity56 said : ' give us a pic of a place with a better claim and we will pay up the money the same day , but we are not worried because we are the real inspiration for the film			1
' but rivals at @entity24 were able to strengthen their claim when the film 's director @entity40 said he had in fact based the mountains on their site			2
the area also has peculiarly shaped granite peaks and is a frequent subject of traditional @entity7 paintings and literature			0
however , staff at the @entity77 tourism office pointed out that film producers had been to their park to take pictures and study the mountains in advance of the film			0
now where have i seen this before : the mountain previously known as the ' @entity87 ' in @entity7 , which has now been named the ' @entity88 ' its 3,544ft @entity87 is one of 3,000 in the @entity91 and they claim was the inspiration for the magical ' floating peaks ' in @entity40 's film			2
to further cement their claim , @entity77 tourism bosses changed the name of the @entity97 to @entity98 and started to cash in with @entity12 souvenirs , and later naming other attractions after parts of the film			0
as to what the visitors think - both parks have said they have seen an 80 per cent rise in visitor numbers since the film was screened			1
@entity108 eyed : there are 3,000 in the @entity91 which certainly resemble the magical ' floating peaks ' in @entity40 's film cashing in : to further cement their claim , despite opposition the @entity15 tourism bosses changed the name of the @entity97 into @entity98 and started to cash in with @entity12 souvenirs , and later naming other attractions after parts of the film picturesque : staff at the @entity77 tourism office however pointed to the fact that producers from the film makers had been to @entity121 to take pictures and study the mountains in advance of the film @entity12 became the highest grossing film of all time after its release in 2009 , beating @entity128 , also directed by @entity40 , off the top spot the action - adventure movie , starring @entity131 , is set in 2154 and tells the tale of a disabled ex-marine sent to @entity134 to infiltrate a race of 10ft ( 3m ) blue aliens and persuade them to let his employer mine their homeland for natural resources			2
the film took more than five years to make and was reportedly one of the most expensive films , with a budget of at least $ 300 million			0
it wowed both critics and fans , winning a @entity150 as well as three @entity151			0
record breaker : @entity12 became the highest grossing film of all time after its release in 2009 , beating @entity128 , also directed by @entity40 , off the top spot remote : the @entity156 region is home to the so - called ' @entity12 ' mountains in the @entity15			0

managers at @entity15 , @entity16 , claim their sandstone pillars were inspiration for ' @entity19 ' on @entity20
rivals at the @entity46 in southern @entity28 province in eastern @entity7 , beg to differ
both parks have seen 80 % rise in visitor numbers since film was released
