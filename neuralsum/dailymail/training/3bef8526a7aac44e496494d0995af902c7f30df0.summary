by @entity1 reporter published : 22:19 est , 28 march 2012 updated : 22:19 est , 28 march 2012 a 15 - year - old girl who disappeared on her way to school earlier this month is believed to have been abducted , police say			1
@entity6 was reported missing by her mother on march 16 , having never made it to the bus or her @entity10 , @entity12 high school on that fateful day			1
after initially allowing for the possibility that @entity16 ran away from the home she shared with her mother and her mother 's boyfriend , the 40 detectives assigned to the case are saying they now believe it is highly unlikely that she vanished voluntarily			1
interviews with friends and a search of her computer also yielded no information indicating she fled			1
a day after her disappearance , sheriff 's deputies found @entity16 's cellphone , an electronic window into her world which now sits in a @entity48 crime lab undergoing forensic tests			1
it was in a field near where she normally caught a school bus in @entity28 , a semi-rural community of 40,240 on the fringes of @entity57 surrounded by mountains , orchards and reservoirs			1
for her family and many of the 583 volunteers who turned out to search for her , @entity16 's abandoned phone wiped away thoughts that she ran away			1
' a teenage girl without her phone ? no way , ' said @entity68 , a mother of two teenagers who showed up at a vacant elementary school that was transformed into the search command center to sign up as a volunteer			1
' if she was planning to run away , she was going to tell friends that			2
' so far , however , the investigation has provided more questions than clues			0
search : both the teen 's cell phone and laptop are now undergoing forensic studies for any further clues clues : her mother snapped this photo of her the morning she disappeared , appearing playful which followed her parents and friends ' perception of nothing out of the ordinary @entity95 sheriff ’s office sgt. @entity94 told @entity96 : ' the first week the focus was on the public ’s help for possible sightings			1
now the focus is to call us with people that are suspicious in the neighborhood			0
we do n’t know where she could be in the area , but we are thinking that whoever is involved either lives in @entity111 area or has a familiarity with the area			0
' the day after deputies located her @entity117 smartphone , they came across @entity16 's handbag a few blocks away			1
several items of her clothing - a @entity124 t - shirt , pants and undergarments - were folded neatly inside			1
tracking dogs lost her scent at the end of the driveway of her home on a @entity132 , leading investigators to hypothesize she never got much further			2
' this seems like a very remote location , and it seems like anybody who would have been there had to have a reason to be there , ' said @entity141 , whose 12 - year - old daughter @entity142 was kidnapped from her @entity144 home in 1993 and murdered			2
' therefore , my immediate thought was : whatever happened to @entity16 , assuming she did not run away , happened on this block , ' he said			2
a missing children 's foundation he founded in his daughter 's memory is organizing searches in the city , about 25 miles south of @entity48			2
of the 46 similar searches the @entity156 organized last year , 37 resulted in either a victim being found alive or their remains located , he said			2
school : last week , sheriffs investigators visited miss @entity6 's school of @entity164 , suspending their ground search for interviews with her classmates and friends without a trace : while police dogs lost her scene at her mother 's driveway her cell phone was recovered sunday in a field nearby growing concern : clothes belonging to @entity6 have been found after the teenager went missing 12 days ago from her home in @entity28 , @entity12 the law enforcement response has included searching the homes of neighbors , contacting registered sex offenders , interviewing friends and relatives , and stopping drivers who travel the road where @entity16 picked up the bus and where her phone and purse were found to ask if they saw anything unusual			1
on tuesday , a sheriff 's team boarded a boat with a cadaver dog to search the shores of @entity197 , a reservoir and teen hangout , while volunteers walked the surrounding brush - covered slopes in a line formation			1
a weekend search by the sheriff 's department and the @entity205 covered a 12 - square - mile radius from @entity16 's home			1
it included canyons and hillsides off major highways that could provide a place to dump something in a hurry , @entity94 said			0
people have called in tips about seeing a girl matching @entity16 's description , he said , but none had panned out			1
' we do not know what she was wearing when she left the house , we do n't know when she left the house because no one saw her do it , and we have not had any new credible leads or tips or evidence since discovering the bag of clothes , ' @entity94 said			2
' there has been ... so many unknowns			0
' @entity233 told investigators she last saw her daughter when she left for work about 6am on march 16			0
volunteers : searchers are briefed by members of the @entity156 as they sign up for duty on tuesday @entity241 continues : a @entity95 county sheriff photographs possible evidence that a volunteer searcher under the guidance of the @entity156 discovered in the area near @entity247 on tuesday keeping hope alive : volunteer searcher @entity249 under the guidance of the @entity252 bags possible evidence in the case @entity254 : the @entity256 underwater search unit prepares to lower a zodiac into @entity247 to look for clues on tuesday just before 6:30am , when @entity16 ordinarily got ready for school , the teenager tweeted			1
a friend received a routine text message from her about 40 minutes later , the time she usually left home to catch the bus , authorities said			2
but investigators have not found anything to signal where to look now			2
the macbook she got for her birthday has not provided any hints about where she might be			0
the night before she disappeared , she tweeted that she planned to write a school essay about teen depression and suicide			2
that same week , she tweeted : ' suiiiiicide im tooo aliiiiive kill ya sellf			0
' @entity16 and her mother have been living in @entity28 since october			1
@entity279 , a family friend , said @entity16 appeared to have adjusted to the move , briefly joining a private cheerleading club and befriending the daughter of her mother 's boyfriend			1
the sheriff 's department said neither @entity233 nor her boyfriend is considered a suspect			0
authorities also absolved @entity16 's father , @entity290 , a registered sex offender convicted in 2009 of one count of lewd or lascivious conduct with a child under 14			1
the victim was not @entity16 or her older sister			2
police say he is cooperating in the investigation and is not a suspect			0
' i 'm not going to hide it			0
it is very important they interview me , i get cleared and cooperate with everything , ' @entity290 said			0
sex offender : the @entity12 sex offender registry entry for @entity307 , @entity16 's father the night before @entity16 went missing , she asked her father to make an appointment to get her hair highlighted			1
he said he texted her the next day to say he had , but never got a reply			0
when investigators reported finding the phone , @entity290 said , ' that was pretty disturbing because we know that she is 15 years old and she loved that phone and was always on it			0
we would get mad at her for being on it at dinner			0
' among the hundreds of volunteers tuesday were several who endured the same ordeal as @entity16 's family			1
one was retired @entity48 police officer @entity325			0
his 28 - year - old daughter , @entity326 , disappeared from a @entity328 - area casino in 2005			0
a man who gambled at the casino that night has been convicted in her murder , but her body never was found			0
on tuesday , @entity325 stood in the command center , explaining to volunteers returning from a fruitless search that their effort was still valuable not just to investigators trying to narrow the territory they have to cover but also @entity16 's parents , who have only question marks			1
' do i hope and pray she is just a misguided teenager and ran away ? yes , that is my number one hope , ' he said			0
' number two is that somebody did abduct her and is keeping her alive somewhere			0
and the last is that at least the family gets closure by finding out who did it and where she is			0
