by @entity0 published : 09:41 est , 7 february 2013 updated : 13:40 est , 7 february 2013 for most children , a bump or scrape is a normal part of everyday life			2
but for @entity7 , it can trigger a sequence of events that could kill him			1
the two - year - old was born with a rare genetic disorder that causes his skin to be very fragile and blister easily , at the slightest bump			1
called @entity17 , it is so serious that doctors wanted he would n't live to be more than eight months old			2
@entity7 , with father @entity20 , was born with a rare genetic disorder that causes his skin to be very fragile and blister easily , at the slightest bump when he was born , doctors predicted that @entity7 ( here with mother @entity24 ) now , two , would n't live past eight months but @entity7 , who lives just outside @entity26 in @entity27 with his mother @entity24 and her partner @entity20 , has defied the odds and is still fighting on			1
the only exterior sign of @entity7 's condition is his extremely sensitive skin , with the slightest bump causing it to peel off			1
his entire body , both inside and out , is covered in sores and blisters			1
the condition also has other unforeseen and serious implications , including respiratory problems that can cause @entity7 's airways to close suddenly and without warning			1
last summer he had to be hospitalised due to severe breathing problems and on another occasion his eyes were totally swollen shut for three weeks			0
@entity7 's condition makes his skin so sensitive , that the slightest bump can cause it to peel off the condition also has other unforeseen and serious implications , including respiratory problems that can cause @entity7 's airways to close suddenly and without warning but his body has battled back each time and , while at one point 70 per cent of his body was covered in blisters , today this is closer to 15 per cent			1
@entity7 has also developed at a normal pace despite his poor immune system and the fact he has to be fed through a tube in his belly button due to scarring of the pharynx			1
the family live in a specially adapted house where everything , including the floor of @entity7 's bedroom , is carefully padded to avoid damage to his skin			1
meanwhile , he is not allowed to interact with children his own age and @entity24 's other two children can only stay every other weekend to limit his exposure to childhood illnesses			0
his mother said : ' we feel pleasure every morning @entity7 opens his eyes but we only ever plan two days ahead			2
' he never complains , but is a rewarding little guy			0
' @entity7 's disease is so rare that doctors have few answers to the family 's questions			1
the family live in a specially adapted house where everything , including the floor of @entity7 's bedroom , is carefully padded to avoid damage to his skin while at one point 70 per cent of his body was covered in blisters , today this is closer to 15 per cent his parents have also faced difficulties with their insurance company regarding the cost of @entity7 's medical care			1
his mother said : ' now we have the full support but in the beginning it was terrible			0
i hope we have taken the fight for future families			0
' doctors are unable to say what @entity7 's life expectancy is , as most people with the same condition rarely live past infancy			1
his mother said : ' the only thing we can hope is that his breathing will be better , that the airways grow the older he gets			2
' and despite the hardships he faces , she says @entity7 has taught her a lesson			2
she said : ' you can get one or the other in life , but it does not mean that you give up			0
she adds : ' it 's not bandages and gloves @entity7 is wearing			2
it 's sweatband and boxing gloves , because we 're gon na beat the s * * * out of this disease			0
' @entity131 causes widespread blistering of both the skin and the mucus membranes			0
areas of the body affected by blistering and chronic ulcers include the eyes , inside the mouth and throat and the toes and neck			0
because the blistering also affects the mucous membranes , such as the moist lining of the mouth and digestive tract , it can make it difficult to eat and digest food			0
as a result , many affected children have chronic malnutrition and slow growth			0
because of these complications , the outlook for children with @entity7 's condition is very poor			1
around 40 per cent of children with the condition die during their first year of life and almost all by the age of five			0
sepsis and respiratory failure ( due to blistering and narrowing of the airways ) are the most common causes of death			0
other complications of @entity131 can include fusion of the fingers and toes , abnormalities of the fingernails and toenails , joint deformities that restrict movement , and hair loss ( alopecia ) .			0

@entity7 , 2 , has rare genetic disorder that makes his skin very fragile
his is covered in sores inside and out , caused by even the smallest bump
condition can also cause his airways to close without warning
parents were warned he would n't see first *birthday* , but has defied the odds
