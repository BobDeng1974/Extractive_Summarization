thousands of patients needing urgent medical treatment could have their conditions diagnosed remotely by doctors using @entity5 video calls under proposals to close and downgrade @entity8 departments			1
under plans seen by @entity16 , patients suffering from potentially serious symptoms such as chest and abdominal pains , pneumonia and fractures will be sent to walk - in centres to see gps rather than go to casualty wards			1
but because the centres are staffed by less qualified medics , advice could come from specialist colleagues at a separate @entity25 ward using @entity5 calls			2
the astonishing proposal is among those being considered by the @entity28 ( @entity29 ) , which is planning to centralise emergency services in the region			0
campaigners warn it is ‘ like death is being built into the system ’			0
the draft proposals , contained in official documents lodged within the july board minutes of the @entity29 , also say : the proposals are the latest planned cuts to casualty units up and down the country , and come despite a new independent report insisting @entity25 provision needs to expand to meet rising demand for services			2
the @entity16 has been fighting for two years to save @entity60 from closure			0
the latest threats mean there are now 18 units across @entity65 facing the axe			0
@entity67 , from the @entity69 campaign group , said : ‘ this is terrifying and means a death sentence for a lot of people			0
in a rural area , the idea of centralising everything – with already long travel times to get to @entity25 – is mad			2
‘ but there ’s got to be a clinical risk in diagnosing patients over @entity5 because you lose so much crucial information if it ’s not done in person			2
it ’s scary they ’re building risk – and possibly death – into the system			0
’ the region currently has two @entity25 departments – at the @entity91 and at the princess royal in @entity42 , both district general hospitals			1
the ‘ @entity95 ’ programme is examining three options – locating a single @entity25 at either the @entity97 or the princess royal , or building a new single @entity25 at a site between @entity97 and @entity42			1
this means patients will have up to travel an additional 18 miles – around 30 minutes – for @entity25 services			0
the @entity29 is considering how many @entity103 will be needed			0
@entity109 , the @entity110 mp for @entity42 , said : ‘ residents are extremely concerned to yet again see a review of @entity25 at a time of large - scale growth in the town			1
we want to see full , 24 - hour @entity25 services at our hospital and this process brings massive uncertainty			0
’ the current @entity25 service is already under pressure and paramedics were forced to wait eight hours , 11 minutes with patients outside a hospital recently because of a shortage of beds			1
but the ambulance service is also struggling and was fined £ 2.6 million after failing to meet strict eight - minute targets to reach seriously ill patients on time – one critically ill six - week - old baby had to wait 41 minutes for paramedics			2
the plans come as a joint report by the respected @entity132 and @entity131 found the ‘ obvious answer ’ to dealing with the @entity25 crisis ‘ might appear to be increasing the capacity of @entity25 ’			1
a spokesman for @entity29 said : ‘ doctors and health professionals believe one single emergency centre in the area supported by @entity103 is the safest way to treat the most seriously ill patients			1

proposals by @entity28 to close and downgrade *accident* and emergency departments
patients with potentially serious complaints will be sent to walk - in centres
plans mean there could be one @entity25 department for more than 600,000 people across @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44
@entity25 could be ‘ ambulance only ’ – so walk - in patients would be *diverted* to an @entity159 ( @entity103 ) .
unwell or *feverish* children would need to go to an @entity103 rather than @entity25 – but the report *acknowledges* that ‘ not all gps and generalists have *[* the skill set to treat them *]* ’ .
paramedics may have to *decide* on the scene whether patients need to go to hospital or an @entity103 . but the report also says studies have found paramedics can not ‘ safely and *accurately* ’ predict this .
patients who have attempted *suicide* , are suffering from potentially life - *threatening* deep vein *thrombosis* , and children having a *wheezing* fit would all be brought to @entity103 .
@entity103 will be dealing with more serious cases , so staff will need specialists on the rota or ‘ timely *access* ’ to them via @entity5 .
