well - water contamination caused by controversial oil and gas drilling - known as fracking - has been confirmed in at least three @entity4 states which have nurtured the nation 's energy boom , according to a new review of industry data			1
new figures show that hundreds of complaints have been made about pollution in @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , casting doubt on industry suggestions that such problems rarely happen			1
in @entity12 alone , at least 106 cases of water - well contamination have been confirmed in the last eight years			1
the data , requested by the @entity22 , also highlight a lack of transparency and major differences in the way these problems are reported			1
anger : anti-fracking protesters hold placards near the @entity31 in september last year			0
new figures show that water - well contamination from oil and gas drilling has been confirmed in at least three states controversial : a rig drills for natural gas at a hydraulic fracturing site in @entity12 , a state where more than 100 cases of water - well contamination have been confirmed since 2005 ( file picture ) while the confirmed problems represent only a tiny portion of the thousands of oil and gas wells drilled each year in the @entity4 , the lack of detail in some state reports could help fuel public confusion and mistrust			1
@entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 provided only general outlines , while @entity15 , which has n't confirmed a single case of drilling - related water - well contamination in the past 10 years , released the most detail			1
the @entity22 found that @entity12 received 398 complaints in 2013 alleging that oil or natural gas drilling polluted or otherwise affected private water wells , compared with 499 in 2012			2
the @entity12 complaints can include allegations of short - term diminished water flow , as well as pollution from stray gas or other substances			1
more than 100 cases of pollution were confirmed over the past five years			1
just hearing the total number of complaints shocked @entity66 , an eastern @entity12 homeowner who complained about water - well contamination that state officials eventually confirmed			1
' wow , i 'm very surprised , ' said @entity66 , recalling that she and her husband never knew how many other people made similar complaints , since the main source of information ' was just through the grapevine			0
' confusion : a fracking site in @entity78 , @entity12			1
the new data highlights a lack of detail in some state reports which could help fuel public mistrust in the industry ( file picture ) the @entity86 were one of three families that eventually reached a $ 1.6 million settlement with a drilling company			1
@entity66 said the state should be forthcoming with details			0
over the past 10 years , hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , has led to a boom in oil and natural gas production around the nation			2
it has reduced imports and led to hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue for companies and landowners , but also created pollution fears			1
extracting fuel from shale formations requires pumping hundreds of thousands of gallons of water , sand and chemicals into the ground to break apart rock and free the gas			2
some of that water , along with large quantities of existing underground water , returns to the surface , and it can contain high levels of salt , drilling chemicals , heavy metals and naturally occurring low - level radiation			0
but some conventional oil and gas wells are still drilled , so the complaints about water contamination can come from them , too			0
experts say the most common type of pollution involves methane , not chemicals from the drilling process			0
fracking fame : the @entity137 family gained celebrity status last year after blaming the high level of methane in their well water in @entity142 , @entity12 , on a natural gas driller some people who rely on well water near drilling operations have complained about pollution , but there 's been considerable confusion over how widespread such problems are			1
for example , starting in 2011 , the @entity151 aggressively fought efforts by the @entity22 and other news organisations to obtain information about complaints related to drilling			0
the department has argued in court filings that it does not count how many contamination ' determination letters ' it issues or track where they are kept in its files			0
@entity164 , spokesman for the @entity165 @entity164 , a spokesman for the @entity165 , the leading industry group in @entity12 , said in a statement that ' transparency and making data available to the public is critical to getting this historic opportunity right and maintaining the public 's trust			1
' when the state @entity174 determines natural gas development has caused problems , @entity164 said , ' our member companies work collaboratively with the homeowner and regulators to find a speedy resolution			0
' among the findings in the @entity22 's review : — @entity12 has confirmed at least 106 water - well contamination cases since 2005 , out of more than 5,000 new wells			1
there were five confirmed cases of water - well contamination in the first nine months of 2012 , 18 in all of 2011 and 29 in 2010			1
the @entity174 said more complete data may be available in several months			0
— @entity13 had 37 complaints in 2010 and no confirmed contamination of water supplies ; 54 complaints in 2011 and two confirmed cases of contamination ; 59 complaints in 2012 and two confirmed contaminations			1
it had 40 complaints for the first 11 months of 2013 , with two confirmed contaminations and 14 still under investigation , @entity202 spokesman @entity201 said in an email			0
anti-fracker : artist and musician @entity206 is pictured at a gas drilling site in @entity142 during an ' artists against fracking ' bus tour of gas drilling sites in @entity212 and @entity12 none of the six confirmed cases of contamination was related to fracking , @entity201 said			1
— @entity14 has had about 122 complaints that drilling contaminated water wells over the past four years , and in four cases the evidence was strong enough that the driller agreed to take corrective action , officials said			1
— a @entity15 spreadsheet contains more than 2,000 complaints , and 62 of those allege possible well - water contamination from oil and gas activity , said @entity229 , a spokeswoman for the @entity230 , which oversees drilling			0
@entity15 regulators have n't confirmed a single case of drilling - related water - well contamination in the past 10 years , she said			2
up in arms : anti-fracking activists demonstrate in @entity212 in september last year over claims the industry is contributing to climate change and other environmental issues affecting communities in @entity12 , the number of confirmed instances of water pollution in the eastern part of the state ' dropped quite substantially ' in 2013 , compared with previous years , @entity151 spokeswoman @entity242 wrote in an email			1
two instances of drilling affecting water wells were confirmed there last year , she said , and a final decision has n't been made in three other cases			2
but she could n't say how many of the other statewide complaints have been resolved or were found to be from natural causes			0
releasing comprehensive information about gas drilling problems is important because the debate is no longer about just science but trust , said @entity262 , a social psychologist who studies environmental policy issues			0
losing public trust is ' a surefire way to harm ' the reputation of any business , @entity262 said			0
experts and regulators agree that investigating complaints of water - well contamination is particularly difficult , in part because some regions also have natural methane gas pollution or other problems unrelated to drilling			1
a 2011 @entity278 study found that about 40 percent of water wells tested prior to gas drilling failed at least one federal drinking water standard			0
@entity12 is one of only a few states that do n't have private water - well construction standards			1
outrage : anti-fracking activists protest in @entity212 in september last year			0
fracking has led to a boom in oil and natural gas production around the nation over the past ten years but other experts say people who are trying to understand the benefits and harms from the drilling boom need comprehensive details about complaints , even if some cases are from natural causes			2
in @entity12 , the raw number of complaints ' does n't tell you anything , ' said @entity303 , a @entity304 scientist who has studied gas drilling and water contamination issues			2
@entity303 said he does n't think providing more details is asking for too much			0
' right or wrong , many people in the public feel like @entity151 is stonewalling some of these investigations , ' @entity303 said of the situation in @entity12			2
in contrast with the limited information provided by @entity12 , @entity15 officials supplied a detailed 94 - page spreadsheet almost immediately , listing all types of oil and gas related complaints over much of the past two years			2
the @entity15 data include the date of the complaint , the landowner , the drilling company and a brief summary of the alleged problems			2
many complaints involve other issues , such as odors or abandoned equipment			0
@entity331 , an expert on oil and gas drilling with the @entity333 , a national nonprofit based in @entity334 , notes that @entity15 regulators started keeping more data on complaints in the 1980s			0
new legislation in 2011 and 2013 led to more detailed reports and provided funds for a new information technology system , he said			0
@entity331 agreed that a lack of transparency fuels mistrust			2
' if the industry has nothing to hide , then they should be willing to let the facts speaks for themselves , ' he said			0
' the same goes for regulatory agencies			0

pollution has been confirmed in @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14
@entity12 has confirmed at least 106 contamination cases since 2005
new data casts doubt on industry suggestions that problems rarely occur
highlights major differences in the way contamination is reported by states
also reveals lack of detail in reports , fuelling public confusion and mistrust
fracking generates hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue for industry
