by @entity0 follow @ @ stu_fraser when @entity2 received the all clear from cancer last july , it only took him one day to return to the courts of the @entity5 for a hit with father @entity7 and brother @entity8			1
on thursday , eleven months on , it felt as if @entity2 took another crucial step on the long road back as he walked onto @entity12 11 for his first competitive match here for two years			1
although he and partner @entity15 lost 6 - 3 , 4 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 7 - 6 to 16th seeds @entity17 and @entity18 , @entity2 said : ‘ it felt great			1
this is my home club			0
back : @entity2 ( left ) took part in his first competitive match for two years on thursday ' i live three minutes away			1
it ’s great to be back having missed last year			2
it ’s the best tournament in the world			0
it ’s what you want to perform well in			0
' we played okay but did n’t perform to our absolute best			0
we got outplayed a little bit			0
’ as @entity2 attempts to work his way up the doubles rankings from @entity35 , however , it is not ideal that he and @entity15 have now suffered first - round losses at the last two @entity37			1
@entity2 gets a protected ranking of @entity39 due to his illness — which he uses to enter tournaments — but it will soon expire which means he may have to drop down to the second - tier @entity43 level if he and @entity15 do not have a good run soon			2
down but not out : @entity15 and @entity2 lost 6 - 3 , 4 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 7 - 6 to @entity17 and @entity18			0

@entity2 plays for competitive match for two years after *battle* with cancer
