' ' both families are hurt			0
let this cop be laid to rest peacefully			0
let @entity52 be put to rest peacefully			2
that 's it , ' @entity170 told @entity182 on tuesday			2
' there 's no back - and - forth			0
i do n't want to argue with no cops , i do n't want to fight with no cops			0
i just want to put him in the ground , he 's gone , that 's it			0
' the funeral today was held just two days after local authorities received threats of vengeance from the @entity98 gang			0
a senior law enforcement official told the @entity196 the gang had threatened to ' kill a @entity5 cop and not stop until the @entity198 is called out			2
' an internal @entity200 advisory , obtained by @entity201 , read : ' @entity202 has received credible information from the @entity139 about specific threats toward @entity5 police officers and law enforcement			1
' the @entity207 may take retaliatory action against police officers			2
' it is not known whether @entity52 was a member of the gang			0
a law enforcement source also told the paper a statewide alert had been issued following three shootings involving police in the city			0
it seems that local authorities are taking the threat seriously since @entity37 's wake was heavily patrolled by police officers armed with firearms and even a tank			1
at the wake , current @entity225 honored @entity4 by promoting him to the rank of detective and awarding him a @entity229			0
@entity4 was everything we would want in a police officer			1
he was hard working and conscientious , good and courageous , strong and considerate			0
to quote the @entity69 in @entity70 , " it was not how these officers died that made them heroes ; it is how they lived			0
@entity4 had always wanted to be a police officer			1
i 've been told that as a boy he 'd travel with his uncle to the precinct to learn about the @entity139			0
from family and friends , we 've learned that @entity4 kept that dream alive in his heart and worked diligently in high school and his years in college to qualify as a police officer			1
and , when the time came to serve , he repeatedly requested to serve in the @entity250 so that he could guard the community which was his home , which was his family			0
he was assigned to the @entity250			0
captain @entity254 describes @entity4 as squared away in his work and manner , intent upon learning , and always trying to be better			0
@entity254 told me how @entity4 would just watch the older guys , watch and learn , that he wanted to bring pride to the @entity250 , and bring honor the profession of law enforcement			0
@entity254 would try to encourage @entity4 to relax and smile			0
i personally think that the " @entity264 " cap that @entity4 wore to work put @entity254 a bit off			2
in the year since @entity4 came on the @entity250 , he participated in patrols and police work , he chased down perpetrators and arrested them , he was on the front lines of the district and handled everything that came his way			2
and whether it was neighbors ' yelling , domestic disputes , or the threat of gun violence , @entity4 was intent upon good prevailing over evil , protecting the vulnerable , and order maintained in our community			2
@entity4 represented the best of that thin blue line which protects and defends civilized society from the indiscriminate violence which human beings are capable of			2
@entity4 understood that serving as a police officer is dangerous , but he also knew that it was the highest calling of service			1
and as @entity4 's family knows , it was not only his willingness to make the supreme sacrifice , but his daily commitment to service , his quiet , dogged determination to be a force for good , and to give the protection of the law to the entire community -- including those who would tear it down			1
@entity4 never excused himself from the standards that he was commanded to enforce			0
the self - discipline and principled behavior , which @entity4 always showed , is what makes a police officer so unique , and it is also what makes the brother and sisterhood that is law enforcement so sacred			1
while we ask you to protect and serve us all , we also ask you to hold yourselves to the highest standards , on the job and also in your private lives			0
this was a part of his service which @entity4 approached with a determination which was exceptional even among police officers			1
this morning , in this sacred place , we as a community express our eternal gratitude for the life and legacy of @entity4 , and that of all law enforcement			2
last week when @entity75 wrote an essay about his brother , he expressed his gratitude in the title , " my hero			0
" well @entity75 , @entity4 is also my hero and i 'm quite certain he 's also the hero of quite a few people in this church			2
as every police officer will honor his memory each time they don the uniform , let all of us take a moment deepen our appreciation for @entity4 's life and sacrifice			1
let us also consider our larger struggle to carve out a space of order and security in this world for ourselves and our families			0
@entity4 's service and sacrifice are a special part of that struggle , and in light of his courage , let us return to it with a renewed determination and commitment which meets his high standards			2
may eternal rest grant unto @entity4 , @entity362 , and let perpetual light shine upon him			0
may his soul and all of the souls of the faithful departed , through the mercy of @entity368 , rest in peace			0
