altering what we eat to conform to dietary guidelines would actually increase emissions of greenhouse gases , a study has found			1
the researchers found that diet - related greenhouse gas emissions would increase by 12 per cent if dietary recommendations are followed			1
and while the scientists are n't suggesting we should ignore dietary guidelines , they are suggesting that such guidelines should be made with more environmental considerations in mind			1
the study is not a recommendation to eat less healthily , however , but rather to highlight the gap between food production and living sustainably			1
this pie chart from the researchers shows how greenhouse gas emissions of certain foods compare to the @entity25 dietary recommendations dr @entity26 and dr @entity27 of the @entity29 's @entity28 looked at the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of around 100 foods			1
they also looked at the potential effects of shifting @entity35 to a diet recommended by the @entity35 @entity25 ( @entity25 )			2
they found that if @entity35 adopted the recommendations in @entity25 's ' @entity39 for @entity35 , 2010 , ' but consumed the same number of calories diet - related greenhouse gas emissions would increase by 12 per cent			1
current estimates put the average @entity35 's daily calories intake at more than 3,300 calories a day			2
increase vegetable and fruit intake			0
eat a variety of vegetables , especially dark - green and red and orange vegetables , and beans and peas			0
consume at least half of all grains as whole grains			0
increase whole - grain intake by replacing refined grains with whole grains			0
increase intake of fat - free or low - fat milk and milk products , such as milk , yogurt , cheese , or fortified soy beverages			0
choose a variety of protein foods , which include seafood , lean meat and poultry , eggs , beans and peas , soy products , and unsalted nuts and seeds			0
increase the amount and variety of seafood consumed by choosing seafood in place of some meat and poultry			0
replace protein foods that are higher in solid fats with choices that are lower in solid fats and calories and / or are sources of oils			0
use oils to replace solid fats where possible			0
choose foods that provide more potassium , dietary fiber , calcium , and vitamin d , which are nutrients of concern in @entity35 diets			2
these foods include vegetables , fruits , whole grains , and milk and milk products			0
if @entity35 reduced their daily caloric intake to the recommended level of about 2,000 calories while shifting to a healthier diet , meanwhile , greenhouse gas emissions would decrease by only 1 per cent according to dr @entity26 and dr @entity27			1
' the take - home message is that health and environmental agendas are not aligned in the current dietary recommendations , ' dr @entity26 said			0
the paper 's findings are especially relevant now because the @entity117 is for the first time considering food sustainability within the context of dietary recommendations , he said			0
in its 2010 dietary guidelines , the @entity25 recommends that @entity35 eat more fruits , vegetables , whole grains , fat - free and low - fat dairy products and seafood			1
they should consume less salt , saturated fat , trans fat , cholesterol , added sugar and refined grains			0
the guidelines do n't explicitly state that @entity35 should eat less meat			2
however , an appendix to the report lists the recommended average daily intake amounts of various foods , including meat			0
the paper titled ' greenhouse gas emission estimates of @entity35 dietary choices and food loss ' was published in the @entity146			1
the recommended amount of meat is significantly less than current consumption levels , which dr @entity26 and dr @entity27 estimated using the @entity25 's @entity151 as a proxy for per capita food consumption in the @entity35			2
researchers at the @entity29 say following dietary guidelines ( stock image shown ) could increase greenhouse gas emissions			1
they say certain guidelines do not have environmental impacts in mind			2
in the study they found the @entity163 would increase emissions by as much as 12 per cent while a drop in meat consumption would help cut diet - related greenhouse gas emissions , increased use of dairy products - and to a lesser extent seafood , fruits and vegetables - would have the opposite effect , increasing diet - related emissions , according to the researchers			1
in the @entity35 in 2010 , food production was responsible for about eight per cent of the nation 's greenhouse gas emissions			1
in general , animal - based foods are responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions per pound than plant - based foods			1
the production of both beef cattle and dairy cows is tied to especially high levels of greenhouse gas emissions			1
for starters , cows do n't efficiently convert plant - based feed into muscle or milk , so they must eat lots of feed			0
growing that feed often involves the use of fertilisers and other substances manufactured through energy - intensive processes			0
and then there 's also the fuel used by farm equipment			0
in addition , cows burp lots of methane , and their manure also releases this potent greenhouse gas			2
in general , animal - based foods are responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions per pound than plant - based foods			1
the production of both beef cattle and dairy cows ( stock image shown ) is tied to especially high levels of greenhouse gas emissions , say the researchers greenhouse gas emissions associated with producing the @entity35 diet are dominated by the meats category , according to dr @entity26 and dr @entity27			1
while beef accounts for only four per cent by weight of the food available , it contributes 36 per cent of the associated greenhouse gases , they conclude			2
the researchers found that a switch to diets that do n't contain animal products would lead to the biggest reductions in this country 's diet - related greenhouse emissions			2
but dr @entity26 said he 's not arguing that everyone should go vegan , and he believes that animals need to be part of a sustainable agricultural system			0
however , reduced consumption would have both health and environmental benefits			0
in their paper , dr @entity26 and dr @entity27 also looked at wasted food and how it contributes to @entity35 greenhouse gas emissions			1
they concluded that annual emissions tied to uneaten food are equivalent to adding 33 million passenger vehicles to the nation 's roads .			1

it is not a recommendation to eat less healthily , however , but rather to highlight the gap between food production and living sustainably
they also found that wasted food in the @entity35 was equivalent to adding 33 million vehicles to roads
