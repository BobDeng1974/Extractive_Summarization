is this the next @entity24 ? these pictures , which appeared earlier today on @entity16 mobile forum 52 @entity6 , appear to show a version of the forthcoming handset customised for the @entity16 market you might need bigger pockets : the pictures appear to back up rumours that the @entity4 will have a 5in screen - with the device dwarfing the hand of the man who has taken the photographs the images were uploaded to @entity16 forum 52 @entity6 just hours ago and were quickly picked up and republished by respected tech site @entity41			1

aside from the screen - size upgrade , the pictures show a mobile that is broadly similar to the last - generation @entity24 , complete with oblong home button			0
another hotly anticipated feature of the forthcoming handset is @entity6 's patented ' eye tracking ' system , which will allow users to automatically scroll through webpages by simply casting their eyes across the display			1

it is believed the new handset could have a 1920x1080 display and boast a @entity65 camera as @entity6 tries to leap ahead of @entity66 in the smartphone wars			1
mocked - up graphics put together by mobile phone retailer @entity99 based on the widespread rumours have shown how the @entity4 could match up to previous incarnations of the @entity24 device			1
a camera on the front of the handset is able to focus on the user 's eye			0
it can then calculate where on the screen they are looking - and automatically advance pages when they reach the bottom , for instance			0
however , @entity41 sounded a note of caution over the latest set of apparently leaked photographs , reminding readers that the @entity138 was leaked several times in dummy casings that concealed its actual design			0
' while this leak does n't have a visibly - fake outer shell , there 's every chance @entity6 could 've crafted a false casing for testing purposes — just as there 's every chance this could be an elaborate hoax , ' the site reported			0
@entity6 ' mobile division chief @entity153 told @entity156 's @entity155 news website that the decision to launch the new smartphone in the @entity81 was spurred by demand from mobile networks			0
