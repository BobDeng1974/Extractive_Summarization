published : 14:28 est , 7 july 2013 updated : 14:28 est , 7 july 2013 the minions of ' @entity2 ' ran away with the july 4th box office , leaving the @entity6 ' @entity5 ' in the @entity7 to studio estimates sunday , the @entity1 animated sequel took in $ 82.5 million over the weekend and $ 142.1 million across the five - day holiday window			1
@entity11 's reimagining of the iconic lawman bombed for the @entity13 , opening with just $ 29.4 million over the weekend , and a disappointing $ 48.9 million since wednesday.the trouncing for @entity13 was especially painful because of the high cost of ' @entity5 ' , which reportedly cost at least $ 225 million to make			1
made by the same team that created the lucrative @entity13 franchise ' @entity16 ' ( the four film series that grossed $ 3.7 billion worldwide ) the @entity19 drew bad reviews and failed to capture the attention of younger moviegoers			0
flop : despite an all - star cast and a huge budget , ' @entity5 ' has failed to captivate the movie - going public animated : @entity28 poses with some life - sized minions , the troublemakers from his film ' @entity2 ' ' we thought it would appeal to a broader audience than it did , ' @entity32 , head of distribution for @entity13 , said			1
ranger danger : the big - budget @entity40 remake could saddle @entity13 with a sizable loss in profits @entity44 : @entity6 's get - up for his role as @entity47 in ' @entity5 ' the poor performance of ' @entity5 ' called to mind a previous bomb for @entity13 : last year 's similarly - budgeted sci - fi adventure ' @entity50 ' which opened with $ 30.1 million.but ' @entity5 , ' which stars @entity52 as the masked lawman , will likely fare better than that disappointment , since @entity6 's international star power should bring in better worldwide business			1
it started with $ 24.3 million abroad , opening in about 30 per cent of its planned international @entity58 critics skewered the film , it did earn a decent b + @entity62 grade from moviegoers			0
but ' @entity5 ' is nevertheless likely to be a sizeable write - down for @entity13 and could impact the company 's stock price when markets reopen monday			2
failure to launch : ( from left ) executive producer @entity69 , actors @entity6 , @entity52 and director / producer @entity11 at the @entity71 of ' @entity5 ' ' everybody beat up on " @entity5 " pretty hard , ' said @entity73 , analyst for box - office tracker @entity75			1
' everything was just not going in its favor			0
' on the other hand , @entity1 made ' @entity79 for the comparatively small amount of $ 76 million ( a figure that does n't count a huge marketing budget )			1
the far - better than expected haul firmly establishes ' @entity2 ' , which stars @entity28 as a diabolical villain turned stay - at - home dad , as a new franchise for @entity1 and @entity88 's @entity87 , the @entity1 - backed animation company			0
humorous henchmen : the loyal but mischievous minions proved too popular with audiences for ' @entity5 ' to get a look - in sweet success : a scene from ' @entity79 ' featuring @entity94 , voiced by @entity95 ( right ) and @entity96 , voiced by @entity28 ( left ) @entity97 , head of distribution for @entity1 , attributed the strong performance to @entity88 , the robust appetite for summer family films , and , above all , those teaming little yellow guys			0
the minions will get their own spin - off in 2014 , and @entity106 said another ' @entity2 ' film is a certainty			0
' the minions steal everybody 's heart , ' @entity106 said			0
' it 's a great time of the year to release a family film with broad appeal			0
' stand - up @entity116 's concert documentary ' @entity116 : @entity118 ' proved savvy counter-programming for @entity120 , opening with $ 17.5 million over five days and $ 10.1 million over the @entity122 's family comedy ' the way , @entity123 ' ( which also stars @entity28 ) opened in 19 theaters with a strong theater average of about $ 30,000			0
it slowly expands for a july 26 national @entity128 ticket sales for friday through sunday at @entity130 and @entity131 theaters , according to @entity75			0
where available , latest international numbers are also included			0
final domestic figures will be released on monday			0
