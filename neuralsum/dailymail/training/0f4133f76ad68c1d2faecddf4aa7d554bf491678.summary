no wonder @entity1 ca n't wait for @entity2 to return in the @entity4 derby on sunday			1
the @entity5 is a particularly happy hunting ground for the @entity8 striker with seven of his record 11 derby goals coming there – including his last five against @entity11			1
so while @entity15 's men will boast home advantage , the @entity18 title and a better team than their neighbours , @entity1 's players inside the away dressing - room will see @entity2 and still believe they can win			1
nobody has scored more @entity4 derby goals than @entity2 – 11 in 22 appearances			1
there will be international talent worth hundreds of millions on show but none is proven in this special fixture than @entity2			0
@entity2 will captain @entity1 in sunday 's derby after serving a three - game suspension @entity2 ( right ) has n't featured for the @entity32 since being sent off against @entity33 in september the 29 - year - old will return from a three - match suspension to wear the captain 's armband for the first time ever in a @entity4 derby and his return ca n't come soon enough for @entity1 who have failed to win their last two games without him and are off the pace for a top - four finish			1
some of his best moments in a @entity1 shirt have come against the emerging enemy from across the city – the special atmosphere clearly fires him up			0
most famous of course was his spectacular overhead kick against @entity11 in february 2011 , which was voted the best goal of the first 20 years of the @entity18			0
it was important too – the winning goal in a 2 - 1 @entity1 victory at @entity57 , but it 's by no means his only derby highlight			1
after drawing a blank in his first derby , @entity2 sent out a warning to @entity11 fans for future years by converting a @entity65 cross to score in a 2 - 0 @entity1 win at the @entity5 in 2005			1
@entity2 won the @entity4 derby for @entity1 in february 2011 with a spectacular overhead kick the change in @entity11 's ownership in 2008 was always likely to tilt the balance of power away from @entity1 , who had been completely dominant in @entity4 before then			1
but @entity2 more than any other @entity73 seemed to thrive on the challenge			0
in the first derby of the “ @entity77 era ” , @entity2 scored the only goal at the @entity5 in 2008 and @entity1 went on to retain the @entity18			1
@entity11 have become serial trophy - winners themselves since then but @entity2 has always been the one player they have failed to control			2
@entity2 ( right ) scored the only goal of the game as @entity1 beat @entity11 1 - 0 at the @entity5 in 2008 he followed up his wonder - goal in 2011 by scoring four times against @entity11 the following year			1
he struck twice in an @entity86 tie in january and twice more in a @entity18 game in december			0
ironically , both games at the @entity5 ended with @entity1 winning 3 - 2			2
his last derby goal was less celebrated though , a weak consolation in a 4 - 1 defeat during the dark days of @entity92			2
there were those who thought @entity96 's arrival in the summer might be a threat to @entity2			0
after all @entity98 was @entity100 's @entity99 captain for @entity101			0
@entity2 scored twice as @entity1 beat their local rivals 3 - 2 in the third round of the @entity86 in 2012 the @entity8 international was on the scoresheet again as @entity1 beat @entity11 3 - 2 later that year in the league it has n't worked out like that though			1
after much deliberation , the new @entity1 manager turned to @entity2 to be his captain as successor to @entity112			0
@entity100 felt @entity1 's captain should be @entity114 and ingrained in the values of the club			2
though @entity2 is from @entity117 rather than @entity4 , he has been at @entity57 for a decade and set to pass sir @entity119 's all - time goalscoring record one day			0
a red card against @entity33 for kicking @entity121 to prevent a counter-attack was unwise			0
but nothing in @entity1 's results since then has suggested that @entity2 wo n't walk straight back into the team as captain and leader			1
@entity128 has taken time to adjust following his loan move from @entity131 and been hit by minor injuries that often accompany a return from a long - term injury , his knee			0
@entity2 's last goal in a @entity4 derby came in @entity1 's 4 - 1 thrashing at the @entity5 last season @entity141 has failed to convince in a @entity143 role and was taken off by @entity100 against @entity144 before @entity1 scored the equaliser			1
so @entity2 is set to face @entity11 – a foot problem early in the week seems to have been overcome - and remains one of the first names on @entity96 's team sheet , either up top alongside @entity98 or as a @entity143 behind the @entity151 and @entity128			2
@entity2 's will - to - win was epitomised by his reaction to losing at @entity11 last season			2
he had just broken the record for derby goals but it was no consolation following a 4 - 1 loss			2
' not good enough , ' he said afterwards			0
' we have to improve , stop giving these sloppy goals away and capitalise on some of our good play			0
' that is exactly what he will be trying to do on sunday and given his @entity5 record , @entity11 will be wary			0
@entity1 boss @entity96 ( right ) will be hoping @entity2 can add to his tally of 11 derby goals against @entity11			1

@entity11 host *fierce* rivals *united* in the @entity18 on sunday
@entity2 is back for the *visitors* after serving a three - game ban
