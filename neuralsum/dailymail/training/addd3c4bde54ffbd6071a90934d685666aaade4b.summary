mr @entity47 told the @entity62 : ' this is something we very much wanted to avoid			0
we believed that dna from @entity7 's mother would be enough to prove that the kidney they sent back was n't @entity7 's			1
' but sadly the @entity6 authorities stood by their request for @entity7 's body to be exhumed and to extract @entity54 from the source			1
' the @entity6 have made it as difficult as possible for us from day one			0

mr @entity47 , 51 , told the newspaper : ' until we get the results of the new samples taken , we can only go by the findings of @entity110 and we remain confident that the kidney sent by the @entity6 authorities is not @entity7 's			2
' if that is the case , the @entity6 authorities have put this family through living hell			0
' to bury your child once is a nightmare but to bury your child twice is beyond a living nightmare			0
' he said if the kidney was proved not to be mr @entity7 's , the family wanted those responsible to be jailed .			2
