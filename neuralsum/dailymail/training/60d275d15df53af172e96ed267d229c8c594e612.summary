just when you thought unemployment was dropping and stock markets were surging back , these three analysts today sent out a stark warning to @entity5 to brace for another financial crash			1
trend forecaster @entity7 advises buying a gun to protect your family , stocking up on gold if the dollar crashes and planning a getaway , so it ’s no shock he ’s preparing for an ‘ economic 9/11 ’			1
share prices and unemployment are posting their best figures in four years since the recession hit , but mr @entity7 , along with authors @entity20 and @entity22 , says the rebound wo n’t last			1
going down : @entity7 is one of three analysts outside of @entity25 sending out stark warnings to @entity5 to brace for another financial crash , just as things seem to be getting better all three were profiled in a @entity30 feature on monday			1
mr @entity20 , who had the @entity31 published last september , believes stocks are simply experiencing an artificial short - term boost			1
mr @entity22 , who had a new version of @entity35 the crash published in 2009 , is fearful of today ’s economic similarities to the @entity38 and says the brief recovery will fail like in the 1930s			1
‘ the economic recovery has been weak , so the next downturn should generate bad news in a big way , ’ he told @entity30 , saying the markets look ' very bearish ' for the third time in 12 years			1
mr @entity7 , who works as an analyst at the @entity7 , which he founded in @entity48 , @entity49 , has been doom - mongering for years - so his latest concerns are hardly surprising			1
fear : authors @entity20 , left , and @entity22 , right , insist the current stock market rebound wo n’t last looking for work : job seekers attend an employment fair in @entity49			1
unemployment fell last month to 8.3 per cent , a three - year low , and weekly jobless claims are at a four - year - low			0
but the doom - mongers are n't happy but he told @entity30 that a potential run on banks by savers could cause the government to invoke a national holiday and temporarily close them all , which happened during the @entity38			2
' when money stops flowing to the man on the street , blood starts flowing in the street ' @entity7 , trend forecaster it comes as billionaire @entity74 chairman and ceo @entity76 today painted a happier picture of stocks , which he said are relatively cheap compared to other investments as the economy improves			2
meanwhile contracts to buy previously owned @entity5 homes neared a two - year high in january in further evidence the housing market was slowly turning the corner , an industry group said today			2
however oil prices have been spurred higher by worries over disruptions to @entity90 supplies due to sanctions against @entity92 and expectations for greater demand from an improving @entity5 economy			2
stronger shares : traders work on the floor of the @entity99 in @entity100 on monday			0
the @entity102 index is now trading around the 13,000 mark - but not everyone is convinced it will stay high economic violence : occupy @entity25 protesters clashed with riot police on many occasions last autumn , including in november after being ordered to leave their camp at @entity110 in @entity100 , @entity49 but on the markets , the @entity111 500 has risen nearly nine per cent so far this year and the @entity102 is trading around the psychologically - important mark of 13,000			2
but the three experts are n’t happy			0
billionaire @entity76 said today that @entity5 stocks remain relatively cheap compared to other potential investments as the economy continues to improve			2
the chief executive of @entity74 ( pictured ) said even though stocks are n't as cheap as they were during the depths of the recession in 2008 , they 're still a more attractive long - term option than bonds , gold , cash or anything else			0
' equities are still cheap relative to any other asset class , ' he said , adding that houses are another attractive investment at current prices			0
meanwhile mr @entity76 reiterated his call for tax reforms and a higher tax rate for wealthy investors like himself and said the @entity5 is simply spending too much and bringing in too little revenue			0
mr @entity22 told @entity30 both markets will crash back below their lows hit at the height of the financial crisis in march 2009			1
unemployment fell last month to 8.3 per cent , a three - year low , and weekly jobless claims are at a four - year - low			0
but mr @entity20 believes that people will be left out of work again in 2013 or 2014 and @entity5 markets will crash because central banks have been pumping so much money into markets that they are unrealistically strong			1
the economy is proving to be the major issue in this autumn ’s presidential election , with every @entity154 candidate berating president @entity155 for his handling of the recession			0
@entity158 said on monday that his major rival @entity160 is ill - prepared to deal with the nation 's economic woes , calling his @entity154 rival a nice guy who never held a job in the private sector			0
but mr @entity160 has mounted an unexpectedly strong challenge against mr @entity158 ahead of the primary in @entity169 tomorrow , despite accusations from his rival that he does n't know how to create jobs			0
mr @entity7 told @entity30 that a higher unemployment rate will cause social unrest and there will be a growing rich - poor divide			1
this would no doubt help fuel movements such as @entity179			0
‘ when money stops flowing to the man on the street , blood starts flowing in the street , ’ he said .			0
