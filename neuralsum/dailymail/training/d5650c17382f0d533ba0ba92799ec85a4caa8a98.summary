it seems this polar bear cub was desperate to be the centre of attention			1
@entity4 , 53 , captured the adorable bear showing off its best dance moves for the camera while on a trip to @entity9 , @entity10			1
the photographer , from south @entity12 , looked on with amazement as the bear threw its giant paws in the air and appeared to strike a series of poses for the camera			2
the polar bear cub appeared to be lapping up the attention as it performed some of its best moves for the camera photographer @entity4 managed to capture the unusual shots while touring the @entity10 archipelago of @entity9 @entity4 said the cub eventually followed its mother but not before completing its ' dance ' and performing a grand finale with a stunning nosedive into the icy waters			1
he said : ' the polar bear cubs were following their mother on some ice but they were certainly full of energy and keen to expend it			2
' they spent a good half hour exploring the area and were a team of mischief and energy			2
the cub was full of energy as it played with its sibling and stood on its hind legs before following its mother across the ice the two bears were describe by mr @entity4 as ' a team of mischief and energy ' as they bounded across the snow the photographer captured the intimate moments on his second trip to the @entity10 archipelago , following a previous holiday in 2012 the cub performed a grand finale by jumping into the icy waters before following its mother to move onwards ' eventually the mother moved on and slowly the cubs followed - after a little dancing and playing			1
' it was just great to be in the right place at the right time and have great light to see and also photograph the cubs			0
' if the weather had been foggy then it would have been a lot harder to even spot the bears let alone observe them			0
even as they disappeared into the distance , the cubs continued play fighting and leaping around ' i have been carrying a camera around with me since i was a teenager and developed images in my darkroom before the wonderful digital cameras emerged			0
' i enjoy wildlife photography because of the sheer challenge to find the wild animal rather than just go to a wildlife park			0
' i initially photographed polar bears in 2012 so to go back this year and capture these images was an epic experience			0
