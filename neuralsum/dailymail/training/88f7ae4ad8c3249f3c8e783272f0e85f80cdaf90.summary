by @entity0 published : 07:26 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 09:10 est , 26 september 2013 a mother and her three daughters are giving a new meaning to the term @entity5 by taking over the running of a farm following the death of their husband and father			1
when farmer @entity14 sadly died from cancer four years ago , his grieving wife @entity12 , 52 , decided to carry on the family business rather than give it up			2
and while mourning the untimely loss of their father , his three daughters backed their mother ’s decision by going to work on the 700 acre mixed arable farm as well			1
farm girls : @entity25 - @entity24 , 25 , @entity12 , 52 , @entity26 , 28 , and @entity27 , 21 , run the 700 acre mixed arable and dairy family farm in the heart of @entity31 now the four women are pulling up trees in the largely male - dominated farming community by making a success of the one million pound a year business			1
@entity12 runs the farm with middle daughter @entity38 , who has a university degree in agricultural studies , and has roped in daughters @entity26 , 28 , and @entity27 , 21 , for manual labour			1
the four women are now in one of their busiest times of the year when they bring in the harvest of 250 acres of barley and wheat , a task that requires 14 hour days			1
@entity27 operates the combine harvester while @entity38 , 25 , drives the tractor and trailer alongside it to take the yield of 400 tonnes of barley corn			2
success story : the four women are pulling up trees in the largely male - dominated farming community by making a success of the one million pound a year business tragic : @entity12 's husband died four years ago and rather than give up the family farm @entity12 and her daughters have taken the unusual step of running the 700 acre mixed arable and dairy farm themselves in charge : @entity12 runs the farm with middle daughter @entity38 , who has a university degree in agricultural studies , and has roped in daughters @entity26 , 28 , and @entity27 , 21 , for manual labour @entity26 takes charge of milking the herd of 180 dairy cows and although modern machinery extracts the milk , it ’s a job that still requires getting up at the crack of dawn			1
@entity77 , in the village of @entity79 , near @entity80 , @entity31 , was run by @entity14 ’s father , @entity81 , who called the business @entity14 and sons			1
the irony of the name has not been lost on @entity12 who has considered renaming it besent and @entity87 but decided not to in honour of her late husband			0
@entity38 had intended to work on the farm and manage it one day after being taught the ropes by her father but she found herself thrown in at the deep end after he died			1
home farm : @entity38 , 25 , is in charge of the day to day running of the family farm milking it : @entity26 takes charge of milking the herd of 180 dairy cows and although modern machinery extracts the milk , it 's a job that still requires getting up at the crack of dawn behind the wheel : @entity27 operates the combine harvester while @entity38 , 25 , drives the tractor and trailer alongside it to take the yield of 400 tonnes of barley corn she said : ' it would have been easy to give the farm up after dad died but that would have meant his life ’s work would have just gone			1
' carrying and sometimes struggling on makes us all feel closer to him in some way			0
' i hope he would be pleased and proud of what we are doing and keeping the farm in the @entity126 name			2
' mother @entity12 said : ' there is quite a troop of us			0
we are all blonde and all females and i think what we are doing has surprised quite a few people			0
' many people have been very supportive and have given us advice but farms are n’t traditionally run by women and some of the traditional farmers see things differently			2
' but there are n’t many things that the girls ca n’t do although sometimes we need a little brawn and we do have a dairyman for that			0
loss : their father was diagnosed with prostate cancer and died in 2009 aged 50			2
at the time @entity38 was about to start her final year at @entity148 while @entity27 was doing her a-levels close : the girls say that sarrying and sometimes struggling on makes them all feel closer to their late father in some way non-conventional : ' many people have been very supportive and have given us advice but farms are n't traditionally run by women and some of the traditional farmers see things differently , ' they say ' delivery drivers often turn up and start addressing the dairyman thinking that he is in charge but it raises a few eyebrows when he tells them they should be talking to @entity38			1
' i am sure @entity14 would be terribly proud of us all , the girls especially			0
to cope with the death of your father and have to run a 700 acre farm on top of that is an awful lot to deal with			1
' @entity14 was aged nine when he moved onto @entity77 with his parents , @entity81 and @entity178			0
he took over the running of the business with @entity12 after they married in 1984 and they went on to have their three daughters			2
but he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and died in 2009 aged 50			2
at the time @entity38 was about to start her final year at @entity148 while @entity27 was doing her a-levels			0
home : @entity14 was aged nine when he moved onto @entity77 with his parents , @entity81 and @entity178 and now the girls have taken over family : their father took over the running of the business with @entity12 after they married in 1984 and they went on to have their three daughters @entity12 said : ' @entity38 planned to come home and eventually run the farm but unfortunately my husband died too soon and she missed out on being shown the ropes in terms of managing the farm			1
' @entity38 said : ' it is not just our gender that surprises a few people but also our age			0
' when i tell people that i am a farmer that do n’t take it seriously and think i have a hobby farm with a few ponies			0
' @entity26 has trained to be a schoolteacher and is about to start her first job in teaching but has spent the summer mucking in on the farm			0
@entity27 has recently completed a degree in environmental geo - sciences at @entity217 and has returned to the farm to help out			0
tough job : ' when i tell people that i am a farmer that do n't take it seriously and think i have a hobby farm with a few ponies , ' says @entity12 busy : it is a busy time of year because the girls have 250 acres of barley and wheat that needs harvesting @entity12 said : ' this is a very busy time of year because we have 250 acres of barley and wheat that needs harvesting and we are an autumn calving farm as well			1
' @entity27 drives the combine harvester and she has to grease it and fuel it as well and @entity38 drives the tractor and trailer to take the corn off the combine			0
' @entity38 is up at 5am and feeds the animals and we then have breakfast and talk about what jobs need doing on the farm that day			0
