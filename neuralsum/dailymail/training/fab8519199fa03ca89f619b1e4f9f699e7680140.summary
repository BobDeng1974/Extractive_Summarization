a top parenting expert has warned mothers that being too possessive of their sons and not letting men be strong father figures can be detrimental to their boys ' upbringing			1
the frank advice comes from parenting expert @entity9 in her new book @entity10 , easier , @entity13			1
according to the parenting and behavioural specialist and former teacher , fathers have much greater influence than mothers in shaping boys into well - adjusted young men - but too often mothers find it hard to back off and let dad take control			1
a top parenting expert has warned mothers that being too possessive over their sons and not allowing fathers to get enough of a look can be detrimental ' without a strong father - figure , ( which could also be a step - father or grandfather ) , boys may struggle to learn how to express their emotions constructively , how to handle their physical strength and learn to respect others - and themselves , ' @entity31 tells the @entity39			1
‘ mothers need to allow dads to be dads and to have their own relationship with their children - and in particular with their boys - without trying to micromanage , ' she says			1
the parenting expert , who has been credited by the likes of @entity47 turning her family life around , also warns mothers about being barking too many orders			1
' a boy will lose respect for the mother who appears to bossing the father around – or criticising him , ' she says			1
so when @entity56 gets little @entity57 dressed in the wrong clothes , feeds him the wrong breakfast and then starts a pillow fight should mum just look on through gritted teeth ? ' yes - absolutely she should ! ' says @entity31			1
' and the gritted teeth part comes because mums assume they know best - but actually none of us is perfect			1
we ’ve got weaknesses too			0
' we ’re not doing it right all the time			0
so really we should n’t be judging the dads ! ' despite the title of her book , the @entity10 , easier , @entity13 author , is at pains to point out that keeping calm is not always the goal			1
in fact , she actively encourages play - fighting for boys of course mums are usually more familiar with the routines : ' even in families where both parents work long hours outside the home , children tend to spend more time with their mothers , ' says @entity31			1
' that ’s not a problem for a girl – but for a boy it is			0
because the genetically preprogrammed urge is for boys to copy their fathers			1
and it ’s hard for a boy to do that when he does n’t spend enough time with @entity56			0
' despite the title of her book , the @entity10 , easier , @entity13 author , is at pains to point out that keeping calm is not always the goal			1
in fact , she actively encourages play - fighting for boys - especially when it 's with their father			1
' mums generally do n’t have an interest in play fighting and they worry someone 's going to get hurt , or feelings will get hurt , or clothes will get ripped or something will get damaged			0
' but none of that is as important as boys getting their energy out and through play fighting they learn a lot about how to fight fair			1
' they learn how to control themselves , they learn how not to be too rough - and they also learn how to make amends if it does go too far			1
' by play fighting with @entity56 , boys can learn how to control themselves , how not to be too rough - and how to make amends if they have been too rough ' dads can teach boys all of that , ' she says but does advise that play fighting that is likely to become manic or annoy others in the house is best taken outside			1
of course mothers are not the only ones that need to make an effort to encourage that father - son relationship to flourish			1
@entity56 needs to work at it too : ' because so many fathers are spending more hours at work and often have longer commutes their time at home may be taken up with household chores such as paying bills , mowing the lawn and doing repairs			2
@entity9 has written the new book using her tried - and - tested @entity157 , easier , happier parenting strategies ' you can see that even a loving , conscientious father can end up not being a very good role - model			1
' they may be reluctant to insist on good behaviour , to enforce rules and routines and to follow - through when rules are broken or routines drift			2
' the less involved a father is , the less confident he will feel and the less confident he feels , the less involved he will want to be , ' she warns			2
@entity31 decided to write the book , which adapts her tried and tested @entity157 , easier , happier parenting strategies to focus on boy behaviour , after parents of boys kept asking the same questions			1
' they were often frustrated exasperated and perplexed , ' she says			0
' parents often complain that their boys are fidgety and easily distracted and socially immature			2
parents worry that their son is n’t fulfilling his academic potential			0
' another issue that concerns parents of boys is the tendency towards disrespect , defiance and aggression			2
and parents do n’t know what to do			0
' the most important piece of advice @entity31 has for parents is to sop telling their children off			2
it may not sound like a recipe for cooperative offspring , but according to @entity31 it is key : ' telling off does n’t work and motivate to improve , ' she says			0
' thankfully there are strategies that can help parents get back in charge , ' she says			0
‘ the strategies i teach parents will help boys to become more cooperative , more confident , more motivated , more self - reliant and more considerate			1
' one such strategy is @entity205 , describing what your child is doing right rather than what they 're doing wrong			0
‘ let ’s imagine a family around the dinner table			2
the little girl is eating with her knife and fork properly and using her napkin properly and sitting with legs in front of her – and waiting to swallow her food before she talks			0
' the boy is doing all the opposite - plus he ’s singing and talking too loudly and interrupting and maybe doing a deliberate burp			2
@entity9 's new book : calmer , easier , happier boys ' so it ’s very tempting to keep saying " no " , " do n’t " , " stop "			1
' ' reprimands may - or may not - get you immediate cooperation , but in the long - term telling off and endless reminders make the behaviour worse – because when children keep hearing about what they ’re doing wrong , they start to feel that ’s who they are			2
' so after a while they do n’t even bother trying to improve their behaviour			0
' in fact , boys often enjoy being able to wind up their parents by burping or making some kid of a vulgar joke			2
' so i advise parents to focus most of their attention on the ok things that the boy is doing			0
notice and mention the tiny steps in the right direction			0
' i ’m not saying it ’s easy to stay positive ; it takes a lot of self - control			2
but it ’s worth practising this strategy , which is called @entity205 , because the more we notice when our children are doing things right , the more motivated they will be to behave better			0
' within a meal a parent might say : ‘ you ’re sitting up straight ’ or ‘ you ’re using your napkin instead of your sleeve ’ or even ' your chewing with your mouth closed and i cant see any of the food in your mouth ’			0
' if you take a moment to look carefully , there ’s always something your son is doing that ’s ok that you can comment on , ' @entity31 says			0
' for example , if your son is talking too loudly , just look at him , with a friendly face , and wait a few seconds until he pauses			0
then at that moment you can say , with a big smile , " and now you ’re not talking too loudly			0
you ’re using your indoor voice "			0
' @entity47 , who took a course in @entity279 , @entity280 , happier parenting in 2010 is just one mother who has been helped by @entity31 's strategies			1
' it absolutely works , ' the star said of trying descriptive praise with her son @entity286 , then seven			0
' @entity286 is lapping it up			0
and as a parent , you become happier because you ’re observing all these good things about your child , if you ’re being specific about what they ’ve done			0
