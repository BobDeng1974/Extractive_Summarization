germ - ridden towels could be the worst culprits for spreading bugs around the home , researchers have warned			1
and its not just kitchen towels that are to blame - bath towels can also spread diseases			1
the problem is two fold : first , towels retain moisture for long periods of time , allowing the bacteria to survive			1
secondly , they are used in the most germ - ridden areas of the house			1
towels could be the most germ - riddled part of your home , experts have warned			1
this is because they retain moisture for long periods of time - allowing the bacteria to survive - and are used in the kitchen and bathroom the recent study , from the @entity30 , found coliform bacteria - bacteria present in faeces which can lead to outbreaks of food poisoning and diarrhoea - in 89 per cent of kitchen tea - towels and @entity37 in 25.6 per cent of towels			1
the researchers said towels are more likely to be bacteria - ridden than other household items because they are used to wipe hand and surfaces that might have come into contact with raw meat products			1
study author @entity46 said : ' you can cross contaminate food when you wipe your hands on a towel and then contaminate other foods or bring your hands to your mouth and infect yourself			2
' with face and bath towels you may spread bacteria and viruses among family members who use the same towels , ' he told @entity60			1
and bunging them in the washing machine might not be enough , either			2
the researchers warned of another study which found bacteria can survive washing and drying with detergent in the kitchen			1
dr. @entity69 , of @entity70 , told @entity71 : ' the three elements required to provide a comfortable environment for bacteria and microfungi are : moisture , warmth and organic material			1
' obviously , towels get wet			2
they also often sit in warm , moist bathrooms and washrooms , and pick up dead skin particles during use , which provides the organic food material for microbes to live on			2
so , what 's the best towel management strategy ? ideally , conventional cotton towels should never be used in communal situations , where bacteria and fungi can be transferred from one person to another			1
washrooms should therefore consider more sanitary hand drying , like paper towels and hand dryers			2
in the home , gym etc , towels should be laundered regularly to remove contamination , and in between uses , should be dried effectively , as drying will temporarily arrest microbial growth			2
damp , used towels in moist bathrooms will encourage microbial growth			2
" so what are the risks ? unlaundered , used , moist towels produce the highest risk of skin infections			0
for example , dermatophytic fungi , like those that cause athlete 's foot , will not only live on the towel , but may cause skin infections in cut , abraded , or sensitive skin			1
it 's skin infections that are the main risk , but if you can smell a mustiness around a towel , the chances are that it 's bacteria and fungi that you can smell , and it 's time for the washing machine			1
' ‘ coliforms , @entity37 and @entity136 can survive the drying of kitchen cleaning cloths and regrow if the cloth becomes soiled again , ’ researchers wrote in the study			1
they say soaking the cloths in bleach for two minutes was more effective in reducing numbers of bacteria than washing			1
professor @entity144 , head of biological and biomedical sciences at @entity146 , warned washing towels at low temperatures does not always kill bacteria			1
he told @entity71 : ‘ there ’s a tendency towards people to use lower temps to wash fabrics , down to 30			0
if a child is unwell , and vomits on fabrics , they need to be washed at high temperatures			0
‘ many of these organisms thrice at body temperature , they live at 37			0
so washing at 30 is not going to kill them			0
but there are laundry additives designed to enhance low temperature washing that will kill bacteria			1
’ even regular bathroom towels need be used with care , he added			1
a recent study found coliform bacteria - bacteria present in faeces which can lead to outbreaks of food poisoning and diarrhoea - in 89 per cent of kitchen tea - towels ‘ when you rub a towel on your body or face , you leave a microbial fingerprint			1
‘ if it remains damp , such as after a shower , the organisms start to grow			0
that ’s why towels start to grow musty			0
‘ in real terms of causing infection , there are lots of bacteria that are n’t harmful			1
' but as an extreme , someone could wipe their backside and then those organisms would be on the towel , perhaps a child or someone with a diarrheal illness			0
‘ the towel would be used to wipe a face then you ’ve got that faecal - oral link that leads to infection			0
' infections such as athlete 's foot are another issue , he said			1
dr @entity208 , a leading hygiene expert from the @entity210 , told @entity71 : ' the first thing is to keep towels separate			2
' put them on the towel rail to dry so they do n't fester while they wait to be washed			0
' wash them often , at least once a week			0
' wash them on a high temperature , @entity218 - and bear in mind lots of washing machines do n’t reach the temperatures they say they will			2
' if you want to wash on a lower temperature , use a laundry cleanser product that kills bacteria			0
' @entity230 would kill bacteria on white towels ' on face flannels , have one for each day and wash them all at the end of the week			2
' everybody should have their own bathroom towels , especially if they 're ill. ' and , to make them extra soft , replace fabric conditioner with vinegar			1
' anything with an exposure risk , especially in a damp environment , can spread infections			0
' if i had athlete ’s foot and rubbed my foot on someone else ’s , they would expect to catch it			2
putting a towel in between just wakes the towel the vehicle for exposure			0
’ and cross-contamination can be even worse in the kitchen , he explained			0
‘ in the kitchen environment you ’ve got the dish cloth which lives in the sink in a bit of water used to dry up spills			0
then you ’ve got the tea towel used to dry dishes when they ’re clean			0
‘ the problem comes when they are used for different purposes			0
' the towels get used for wiping up footprints from a cat , or a shoe			0
' you might end up washing up a spillage of raw chicken juices , and then next you might wipe some chocolate off a baby ’s face with the same towel			0
‘ it ’s probably full of nutrients , its damp , so bacteria will thrive			0
‘ these bacteria cause diarrhoeal disease , gastroenteritis			0

main problem is that towels retain moisture , allowing bacteria to breed
and they are used in the most germ - ridden areas of the house
researchers analysed tea towels for bacteria that causes food - poisoning
sickness - causing bacteria *detected* in *90* **%** of towels and @entity37 in *26* **%**
hygiene experts warned bacteria can also transfer from bathroom towels
diseases like athlete 's foot can be passed on to different family members
washing at *90*c is the best way to get rid of the germs , say *doctors*
