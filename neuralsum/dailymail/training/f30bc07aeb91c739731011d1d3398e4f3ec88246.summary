by @entity0 questions : @entity3 set up the @entity4 the @entity6 campaign after her mother @entity2 died at @entity7 half the cash paid to victims of the @entity12 hospital scandal has been pocketed by their lawyers , the @entity8 can reveal today			1
one patient who suffered botched surgery was paid just £ 6,500 in compensation yet his solicitors picked up £ 221,000 – 34 times as much			1
and , in another case of neglect at @entity21 , lawyers made almost £ 50,000 while the victim received only £ 15,000			1
official figures show that 104 negligence claims have succeeded against the @entity12 over the past four years			2
but ‘ ambulance chasing ’ lawyers have picked up almost half of the £ 7.4million compensation paid out by taxpayers			1
because the figures are incomplete the solicitors ’ share may be higher still			1
hundreds of patients are feared to have died unnecessarily at @entity7 between 2005 to 2009 , and earlier this year a damning report warned that many others had suffered appalling abuse			2
the startling compensation figures have raised fresh concerns over the tactics employed by lawyers who tout for @entity6 negligence cases			1
using the controversial ‘ no - win , no fee ’ system , they entice the vulnerable with slick sales pitches on tv adverts			2
if they win , they demand costs of up to £ 900 an hour , which they justify as their reward for taking a risk			2
last night @entity53 , the @entity54 chairman of the commons public accounts committee , described the figures as shocking			1
shocking : in a case of neglect at @entity21 , pictured , lawyers made almost £ 50,000 while the victim received only £ 15,000 ‘ lawyers provide an invaluable service in supporting people ’s rights , but they should not be exploiting this in a way which is greedy and excessive , ’ she said			1
‘ it takes a lot for somebody who has suffered negligence – or whose relatives have – at the hands of the health service to take action			0
‘ to then find that you have greedy lawyers exploiting you by making money on the back of it is unacceptable and extremely disgraceful			1
’ bereaved relatives and victims of the @entity12 scandal have been frustrated at how long their legal cases have taken			2
criticism : last night @entity53 , chairman of the commons public accounts committee , described the figures as ' greedy and excessive ' by the time some cases finished , the medical staff responsible for the blunders had retired or changed careers – sparing them any accountability			1
@entity3 , who set up the @entity4 the @entity6 campaign after her mother @entity2 died at @entity7 , said : ‘ if the @entity6 stopped harming patients then the solicitors would n’t be able to claim the money			2
‘ the @entity6 has created this situation by harming patients and then making it so difficult to get answers			0
' if you take legal action you just get a small settlement			0
you do n’t learn any answers and the trust does n’t learn any lessons			0
' i have met people who have been in a legal battle with the @entity6 for 20 years and they still have no answers			0
’ @entity110 , whose 67 - year - old mother @entity111 died at @entity21 , added : ‘ the system is torture			0
it took me three years to get my complaint upheld			0
they treated my complaint with utter contempt			0
‘ my mum died of something she caught in hospital			0
the responsibility is on the trust to be open and transparent			0
’ lawyers say they expect to see an ‘ explosion ’ in medical negligence claims in future years , following the scandals at @entity12 and at @entity128 this week			2
last year legal firms received £ 250million through claims against the @entity6 as a whole for medical negligence			1
during a 12 - month period between 2011 and 2012 , five practices received £ 35million between them			1
a spokesman for @entity7 trust said the compensation payments were made by the @entity138 , which acts as an insurance scheme for the hospital , and the majority were for ‘ historical ’ mistakes			1
the spokesman added : ‘ we never hush up mistakes			0
all serious incidents are reported to a board held in public every month			0
this does not reflect @entity21 as it is today			0
the care of our patients has significantly improved			0

half of the £ 7.4m paid to @entity152 victims has been pocked by lawyers
one patient received £ 6.5k in compensation , while his solicitors got £ 221k
in another case , lawyers made £ *50k* , yet victim only received £ *15k*
lawyers ' actions are ' unacceptable and disgraceful , ' says @entity53
