for many hay fever sufferers , spring can be a mixed blessing			1
with the benefits of longer days and warmer weather comes the misery of endless sneezing			0
and the bad news for hay fever sufferers is that this year is going to be particularly bad			1

maps show ( left to right ) how the proportion of people with hay fever is expected to increase by 2009 , 2020 , 2040 , 2060 according to experts , the birch pollen hay fever season will start much earlier than usual this year			1
and over the next 50 years , the number of hay fever sufferers may double , they say			1
dr @entity8 , director of pollen @entity20 , predicts that this year the birch pollen hay fever season will hit the @entity20 by the end of march			1
she said : ‘ this year ’s birch pollen season is expected to start three to four weeks earlier than 2013 and is set to be a high pollen production year , with high or very high pollen counts occurring on warm , dry days with some wind			2
‘ current indications for 2014 suggest that the birch season will start abruptly in the @entity30 and @entity31 between march 25 and 28 , but some sufferers may be in for an earlier hay fever hit as temperatures continue to rise			1
‘ there will be a short lag time of about two weeks when it will reach @entity38 mid-april			2
pollen count is highest in central and south eastern @entity10			0
it is much lower in @entity38 and @entity41 ‘ the @entity30 and @entity31 will be the worst affected areas and the season is likely to last for approximately four weeks in each location			0
‘ last year , the birch pollen season started nearly a month later around april 24 , across the @entity30 and the @entity31 and the season was below average severity across the season overall			0
’ dr @entity8 says that @entity20 currently has one of the highest rates of hay fever in the world with about 25 per cent of the population suffering			1

it is thought that this year the @entity20 birch pollen season will start three to four weeks earlier than normal			2
image shows a pollen calendar for the @entity20 ‘ this will have important consequences for the individual sufferer in the form of economic and social costs , together with decreased quality of life and exam performance			0
‘ the costs of absences from work and decreased productivity , together with the costs of remedies and gp consultations are estimated to be about £ 7 billion a year in the @entity20			0
‘ there is a high probability that climate changes over the next few decades will bring longer and more severe pollen and spore seasons which will , in turn , increase these financial and social costs significantly			0
’ dr @entity8 said : ' this year 's birch pollen season is expected to start three to four weeks earlier than 2013 and is set to be a high pollen production year , with high or very high pollen counts ' however , it is not all bad news as dr @entity8 says there are things people can do to reduce their symptoms			2
she says it can be helpful to avoid going outside when the pollen count is high - normally from early to mid-morning - and to avoid cutting the grass			0
she says people can also benefit from wearing wraparound sunglasses to keep the pollen out of their eyes and to avoid drying laundry outside when the pollen count is high .			0

the season is expected to start three to four weeks early this year
it is predicted to hit southern @entity10 between march 25 and 28
