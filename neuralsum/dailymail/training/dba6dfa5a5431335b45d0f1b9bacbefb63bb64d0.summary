read @entity1 's match report from the @entity2 @entity3 felt @entity4 deserved the late winner from @entity6 that sent them through to the quarter - finals of the @entity9 at the expense of @entity11			1
saints looked in control at 2 - 0 up at half - time against the team they beat in the @entity17 on saturday , but the @entity18 fought back and levelled through @entity19 with eight minutes remaining			1
@entity11 appeared to be the more likely winners at that stage but @entity22 saw red for two yellow cards in less than a minute			1
@entity11 keeper @entity24 was helpless as @entity6 's strike curled inside his left - hand post @entity4 striker @entity6 continued his impressive run of form against @entity11 on wednesday night the second was for a foul on @entity31 and , from the resulting free - kick , an error by @entity34 allowed @entity6 to grab his second in the 88th minute			1
@entity3 said : ' we played well			2
it was more difficult when they made it 1 - 2 after half - time			2
' in the first half we scored two great goals and were much the better team on the pitch			2
they showed more character after half - time , real fight , but we created three big chances for the third and did n't take them			2
' they were physical and brought @entity22 in , and it 's difficult to defend			2
it 's not the way i like to play but that 's @entity11			1
' maybe after the red card for @entity22 we were a little lucky but we deserved to win , we had more chances than @entity11			1
' @entity57 celebrates with @entity58 after scoring to put @entity4 2 - 0 up against @entity11 substitute @entity22 was shown a red card by referee @entity60 for a second bookable offence @entity6 has been a key figure in @entity4 's run of nine wins in 10 games and took his tally for the season into double figures			1
' @entity6 is a great player and showed his qualities , not only scoring , but as a target man , ' said @entity3			1
' little by little the players are learning how to play with @entity6			2
he 's been a great signing for us			0
' you ca n't always win the football way			0
@entity11 made it very difficult and made it a battle in second half			2
but my team showed spirit			0
even after the disappointment of going to 2 - 2 , the feeling was positive on the bench			1
' i had the possibility to change players and i was confident if it went to extra time			0
' @entity11 boss @entity90 was frustrated by the result after seeing his side make amends for a lacklustre first - half display			1
' we put in a huge effort in the second half , ' he said			0
' we needed to because in the first half we did n't really get anywhere near the intensity that i was hoping for in terms of making it a real cup tie			0
' the difference with the second half was marked			0
it was a real effort and i thought the momentum was with us			0
' at 2 - 2 i felt we were in the ascendancy and we could go on and possibly win it from a situation where at 2 - 0 down you think it 's going to be very hard against a very good @entity4 team			1
' @entity3 argued @entity113 could have been sent off at 2 - 1 for a challenge on @entity58 that earned him a booking - one of seven shown by referee @entity60			1
@entity11 striker @entity19 ( centre ) scores @entity11 's second goal against @entity4 midfielder @entity117 gave @entity11 a lifeline with a goal three minutes after the interval @entity90 felt @entity22 was a little unfortunate to see two of those - with the first coming for a clash with @entity124 and the second the late challenge on @entity31			1
' i felt the first yellow card was a little bit harsh on @entity22 , ' said @entity90			0
' i think he made a genuine attempt to just try to get across the lad			0
whether or not the referee thought he raised his arm , i do n't know			0
' the second one , he 's miscontrolled it and in trying to retrieve the ball he 's high			0
when you 're on a yellow card , there 's always a risk you 're going to get another one if you go in with a challenge like that			0
' we 've lost him , and that took a bit of the wind out of our sails , and then we have n't dealt with a ball into our box			0
' @entity4 , who have never won the @entity9 , will travel to @entity150 in the last eight .			1

@entity4 beat @entity11 2 - 3 at the @entity2 on wednesday night
@entity6 scored a late winner to send the @entity4 through
@entity3 's side will face @entity150 in the last eight
@entity4 manager felt his side deserved the @entity9 win
