by @entity0 published : 04:48 est , 5 june 2013 updated : 04:58 est , 5 june 2013 campaigners have hit out at @entity2 for removing images of women who have undergone mastectomies because they are classified as ' pornography '			1
photographs posted online by @entity8 , which aims to raise awareness of breast cancer , show women proudly displaying the scars from having invasive surgery on their breasts			2
but a number of them were removed by the social media giant , which has a policy banning sexually explicit images on the site			2
the project 's founder , photographer @entity21 , was kicked off @entity2 for a month over the images , and called for the site to educate its staff properly to avoid a repeat of the incident			1
controversial : some of these images were banned from @entity2 for their allegedly explicit content moving : the images by @entity21 feature breast cancer survivors displaying their mastectomy scars inspiring : the photographs are intended to remove the stigma currently surrounding breast cancer for several years , @entity8 has been encouraging women to share picture of their mastectomy scars in an attempt to remove the stigma surrounding breast cancer			1
the striking images show women who have had their breasts removed , leaving them with highly visible surgery scars			0
last month , mr @entity21 added a new set of photographs to the project 's @entity2 page in the wake of @entity51 's revelation that she had undergone a double mastectomy in an attempt to avoid contracting cancer			2
however , the social network soon removed many of the images and handed the photographer a 30 - day ban for allegedly violating its terms of service			1
he told @entity61 : ' i ca n't imagine anyone finding anything pornographic or sexualised or even offensive in any way			0
' outrage : campaigners have started a petition urging @entity2 to change its policies on pictures like these apology : @entity2 has now reinstated the images and vowed to clarify its photography policies defiant : many breast cancer sufferers derive strength from the bravery of those featured in the images in response , one breast cancer patient started a petition on @entity83 in an attempt to persuade @entity2 to clarify its policy on photographs of mastectomies			1
she wrote : ' they document the physical and emotional toll of women and men who have undergone mastectomies			0
' they raise awareness of the disease and reinforce the need for early intervention and research toward a cure			0
' a @entity2 spokesman has apologised for censoring the image , saying that the site has ' long allowed mastectomy photos to be shared on @entity2 , as well as educational and scientific photos of the human body and photos of women breastfeeding '			1
project : @entity21 began the series years ago but was recently inspired by @entity51 's courage policy : @entity2 insists it is a supporter of the campaign and will work with photographers in the future mr @entity21 spoke to representatives of the company yesterday in an attempt to prevent a repeat of the incident			0
' they 've had a policy in place allowing mastectomy photos , and they made it clear during our conference call that obviously mistakes had been made , ' he told @entity61			0
' i think it 's not lost on @entity2 how important this issue is to so many people , and perhaps they 'll spend some time internally educating their staff about the types of images @entity8 has			1
' @entity2 's official policy on pictures of nudity currently reads : ' @entity2 has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved			2
we also impose limitations on the display of nudity			0
