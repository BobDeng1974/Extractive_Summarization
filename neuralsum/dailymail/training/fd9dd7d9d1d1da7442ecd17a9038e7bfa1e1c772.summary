by @entity1 correspondent scientists may have hit on the secret behind @entity5 ’s success on the track – his perfect knees			1
a study of @entity10 youngsters found those whose legs , and particularly knees , match in size grow up to be the best sprinters			1
the finding could help explain why athletes from the @entity19 island dominate international 100m and 200m races – the distances @entity5 specialises in			0
perfectly formed : scientists say the secret of @entity5 's success might be his symmetrical knees the theory may seem bizarre , but many scientists believe perfectly paired body parts are a sign of good genes and good health			1
previous studies have linked symmetrical bodies and faces with everything from good looks to fertility			2
the latest study , which started in 1996 , involved almost 300 @entity10 schoolchildren whose bodies were measured from the age of eight			1
when they reached 22 , they were asked to undergo more tests , including two sprint races , with just over half taking part			0
the study of @entity10 youngsters found those whose legs , and particularly knees , match in size grow up to be the keenest and best sprinters the results showed that those with the most symmetrical legs – and in particular knees – as children were more likely to agree to race			1
significantly they clocked up faster times than the other young men and women			0
@entity62 researcher @entity61 said his results could help explain the success of six - time olympic gold medallist bolt – whose 100m world record is 9.58 seconds – and his teammates , but added more research is needed to back up his symmetry theory			2
he told the @entity70 : ‘ we need to ... look at international level sprinters and add some genetic tests			2
also more data on @entity75 will help to further clarify the issue			0
’ writing in the journal @entity78 , he added that symmetrical knees could also be a sign of general healthy development of the body			1
other theories behind @entity10 ’ sprinting success include higher numbers of ‘ speed genes ’ and fast - twitch muscle fibres that provide the explosive power needed for sprinting			1
professor @entity61 said : ‘ we found that participants with symmetric legs in 1996 , particularly knees , tended to volunteer for the sprints and they tended to run the fastest when tested in 2010			1
‘ there was some evidence that these @entity10 children had substantially more symmetry in their legs than @entity100 children			1
‘ so we think our results inform the debate as to why @entity10 tend to win gold medals in sprinting			2

’ he added that symmetrical knees and legs may not only be conductive to speed			2
they may also be a sign of general healthy development of the body			2
professor @entity61 said : ‘ it may be the simple explanation is that symmetric knees are more efficient during sprinting			0
research also suggests that @entity10 children 's legs tend to be more symmetrical than those of their @entity131 counterparts ‘ however , for me , the most likely explanation concerns the nature of developmental stability			1
‘ people have a genetic instruction to develop symmetrically across most of the body			0
however , it is very difficult to maintain symmetry in , for example limbs , particularly if one is a rapidly growing child			0
‘ we initially measured these children when they were about 8 years old , and their knee symmetry at 8 years predicted their sprinting speed years later			0
‘ this suggests that symmetry can only be achieved and maintained by individuals with " good genes "			1
such genes are likely to influence one 's physiology and hence one 's running speed			0
