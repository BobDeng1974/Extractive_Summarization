parents could be banned from parking near their children ’s school and fined up to £ 100 if they disobey			2
from next month , town halls will be given sweeping powers to outlaw any activity which may have a ‘ detrimental effect ’ on the quality of local life			2
ministers insist so - called public spaces protection orders ( @entity12 ) are intended to clamp down on anti-social behaviour , such as spitting and aggressive begging			1
anyone flouting the order will be liable for an on - the - spot fine , normally between £ 70 and £ 100 , from a police officer , @entity28 , council worker or security guard employed by the town hall			0
refusing to pay will be a criminal offence that can land the person in court			0
the @entity36 think - tank asked a string of council enforcement teams how they plan to use the legislation			0
examples included prohibiting parking outside schools			0
streets close to the entrance would be made ‘ no parking ’ areas for non-residents at drop - off and pick - up times			1
a zone would most likely be designated after complaints from nearby residents			0
the think - tank said it had been told parking in front of a home with a ‘ for sale ’ sign may be banned , as well as busking , begging , skateboarding and ball games			1
councils are also considering restricting when ‘ chuggers ’ – charity collectors – can operate in town centres			1

from next month , town halls will be given sweeping powers to outlaw any activity which may have a ' detrimental effect ' on the quality of local life - including playing all games in public places @entity84 , @entity36 director , said : ‘ the possibilities for the use of these powers are endless … @entity12 amount to a blank cheque for councils to ban anything that is unusual or unpopular , or with which officials disagree			1
’ @entity93 peer @entity92 , who hopes to get busking exempted from @entity12 , said he feared they would be used in a ‘ heavy - handed ’ way			1
he added : ‘ these are very wide - ranging powers and it is vital that it is made very clear to local authorities that they should have proper grounds for invoking them			0
’ pspos replace three existing powers : gating orders to close alleys used for anti-social behaviour ; designated public place orders confiscating alcohol ; and dog control orders that ban dogs or require them to be on leads			1
anyone flouting the order will be liable for an on - the - spot fine , normally between £ 70 and £ 100 , from a police officer , @entity28 , council worker or security guard employed by the town hall			0
refusing to pay will be a criminal offence that can land the person in court but the new legislation , in force from october 20 , can regulate any activities in public spaces which the local authority believes have a ‘ detrimental effect on the quality of life of those in the locality ’ – or is likely to do so			2
the @entity36 said while the scope of the orders is similar to that of bylaws , they can be obtained much more easily			0
bylaws must go through a democratic process and be sanctioned by the secretary of state , while @entity12 are made in a summary manner by councils			2
a @entity36 report warns the range of activities that could be deemed detrimental is ‘ extremely broad ’ , adding : ‘ one person ’s favourite busker could be another person ’s awful racket			2
’ once an order is imposed , any appeal to the @entity147 must be made within six weeks			0
crime prevention minister @entity149 said the @entity151 wanted the orders to tackle anti-social behaviour rather than parking and that councils had been given this advice .			1

the orders were intended to clamp down on anti-social behaviour
so called @entity12 were used for behaviour like spitting and begging
but councils are now planning to roll them out to ‘ nuisance parking ’ , ball games in public car parks and even ‘ inappropriate dress ’
