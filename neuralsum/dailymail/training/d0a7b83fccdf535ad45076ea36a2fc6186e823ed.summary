these are the amazing scenes when a wildlife photographer in @entity2 thought he was about to get some unbelievable images of a female bear and her cubs on the banks of a river			1
the unnamed photographer is equipped with a wide - angled and long lens - which is even covered in camouflage			0
the bear and her three cubs walk just a few feet in front of the photographer as he captures images on both of his cameras			2
however , @entity17 , 44 , from @entity18 , was volunteering in @entity19 , when he spotted the potential danger			0
while the first photographer concentrates on the bears in front of him , he is completely oblivious to the second bear approaching from behind			1
fortunately , the second bear was not interested in the photographer who survived the potentially fatal encounter unscathed			0

a wildlife photographer thought he got as close as possible to a family group of bears at a @entity2 wildlife reserve
the family unit was photographed as it walked from the woods over towards the water *'s* edge
however , the photographer was completely oblivious to the second adult bear as it approached from behind
luckily for the *unsuspecting* photographer , the second adult bear was *uninterested* in him and walked away
