by @entity1 reporter published : 23:45 est , 12 january 2014 updated : 06:16 est , 13 january 2014 another arctic blast is on its way for residents in the @entity6 and @entity7 still reeling from last week 's brutal polar vortex -- but according to meteorologists , it wo n't be as severe			1
the upcoming front of icy temperatures is expected to first bring arctic air to southern @entity14 , then move into the northern plains of the @entity16 before moving to the @entity6 and @entity7 -- each of which is still recovering from last week 's frigid temperatures			1
the polar plunge 's expected path for this week is seen here ... ... and by the middle of week residents near the @entity24 should expect lake - effect snow			1
@entity27 states and states in the @entity29 are expected to see temperatures at or below zero bundle up : another blast of arctic air is expected to hit the @entity16 next week - despite mild temperatures over the weekend frozen : @entity36 air from last week 's @entity37 caused many parts of the @entity24 to freeze over the polar vortex last week was so cold that @entity40 froze in an incredibly rare occurrence ice from the breath forms around this woman as she exercises by walking outside in during last week 's polar vortex ' following the retreat of arctic air this weekend , waves of progressively colder will move southward over @entity14 next week , ' @entity45 told @entity49			1
the new arctic blast is due to the northern plains by monday , the lower @entity52 and @entity6 on tuesday and on wednesday then the @entity7 on thursday			2
like the last bout of icy air , this one is the result of a portion of the polar vortex breaking away from the @entity59			0
' we will likely see a piece of the polar vortex break off and set up just north of the @entity24 spanning jan. 16 to 20 , ' mr @entity60 said			2
' this next main arctic blast will not rival , nor will be as extensive as the event this past week , ' he continued			0
unlike the last push of cold air , weather experts expect temperatures to stay above zero in most locations in the @entity72 , @entity73 , the @entity74 and the @entity6			1
a train can be seen passing over the ice - packed @entity76 in @entity78 at the weekend @entity79 looks across the ice - filled @entity80 , near @entity82 in @entity83 on saturday @entity27 states and states in the @entity29 , however , are expected to see temperatures at or below zero			2
additionally , anyone near the @entity24 should also expect lake - effect snow			1
there is also a chance that the cold air could deposit snow in parts of the @entity93 and along the @entity7 later in the week			1
weather maps for the middle of next week show the polar vortex creeping back across the @entity16 many areas are still recovering from the extreme weather last week , which has caused a dam of ice to block the @entity76 in @entity78 , forcing roads to close and causing a severe flood risk			2
a @entity104 ice cutter has been called in to try to clear shipping lanes but after 2 and half miles the 2ft ice had become to thick to break up			0
chunks of ice have been building up for days near the @entity111 , @entity108 reported			0
but with the sudden warm temperatures , it is feared a fast thaw will flood low - lying areas			2
' if in fact the ice jam breaks then we 'll have a rush of water which could cause flash flooding , ' @entity116 , of @entity117 , said			0
flash flood warnings are in place in several of the regions affected by the polar vortex , as rain falling on the already frozen ground is forced to run off			0
nearly all of @entity83 is under a flood warning after the sudden rise in temperatures caused a faster than usual thaw			0
a chaotic scene of ice chunks could be seen stretching across the state 's @entity80 near @entity82 on saturday morning			0
but the thaw is likely to be halted by the new cold front coming in , even though it is not expected to be as severe as the one last week			1
blocked : ice piles up on the @entity76 near @entity111 , @entity78 , on saturday , causing flooding @entity142 takes photos of the frozen @entity76 on saturday , where the build up of ice is causing a flood risk mist rises from the @entity76 as chunks of ice ride up near @entity111 , @entity78 at the weekend			0

experts do n't expect temperatures as severe as last week 's chill
most of the country 's temperatures will remain above zero *degree* - unlike the last @entity37
*cities* near the @entity24 should expect lake - effect snow
chance of snow for parts of @entity93 and along the @entity7 later in week
new cold front is expected to hit the @entity7 on thursday
