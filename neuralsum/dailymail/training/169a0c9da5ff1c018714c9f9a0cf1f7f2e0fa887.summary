there 's a little bit of a feeling that @entity3 have become the forgotten team of our @entity6 group , but we know the danger they pose if not taken seriously			1
they have some really talented players based all over @entity13			2
their sevens background naturally breeds players who like to play an expansive and attractive style			2
sevens is a quick game and it helps develop a lot of good centres , wingers and full backs			2
you only have to look at @entity24 and @entity25 , who play for @entity26 and @entity27 , for two examples of the kind of talent produced in @entity3			1
@entity32 ' @entity31 ( right ) gets away from @entity27 's @entity33 during their match last saturday the @entity35 were beaten 33 - 28 by the @entity27 at the @entity36 in @entity37 saturday is a chance to lay down a @entity6 marker			1
the @entity40 are obviously the no 1 team in the world and we play them the following week , but that wo n’t be in the back of anyone ’s mind			1
@entity3 are our focus ; they are really strong and , if we ’re not switched on , they can do some damage			1
on a personal note , it will be nice for me to get back on the wing after my run at centre against @entity27			1
i enjoyed the switch in position , even if it was cut short by the injury to @entity60			2
our performance was very positive , but there has been a negative spin put on it because of the final score			2
while we did n’t get the victory , we did outscore @entity27 by four tries to three			1
any other day that would be a win			2
@entity24 runs with the ball during @entity26 training ahead of their clash with @entity72 @entity27 's @entity73 breaks through the @entity35 defence to score a try against them last saturday it was our first game on the new semi-artificial pitch			1
the surface was very quick compared to what we had previously , but the more we play on it , the easier it will become			0
i think it can give us a real advantage going forward — starting tomorrow			0
we ’ve got @entity85 back in the squad and it ’s great to have him involved			0
he was left out initially but he ’s already up to speed ; that alone goes to show what a talented player he is			0
@entity92 was booed by a small part of the crowd on saturday and that ’s pretty appalling			1
he ’s an outstanding talent and i do n’t think people understand how rough he ’s had it in terms of injuries and criticism on social media			0
it almost caused him to hang up his boots			0
i do n’t think anyone should be driven to that position			0
it ’s just not on			0
the team all support him			2
everyone has ups and downs , but i think @entity92 has shown in his last four or five games for the @entity116 that his form is coming back			0
@entity92 of @entity32 is tackled by @entity118 of @entity27 ( right ) during the match between the two sides he just needs some time to find his feet			1
@entity122 told him to go out and show two fingers to his doubters and i agree with him			0
when he finds his form everyone will suddenly say , ‘ oh , he ’s amazing , whey did n’t we pick him for the first test ? ’ it ’s just the @entity35 public ! we 're doing a lot of intensive training and that definitely helps you build up an appetite throughout the day			0
big @entity136 , our nutritionist , puts on some lovely grub for us			0
it ’s all very healthy stuff but i like to have the occasional sweet on the side			0
a lot of the big front - five guys can put their food away , but none more so than @entity147 — he can eat like there ’s no tomorrow ! when he ’s not hungry he will still eat and he ’s face down most of the time without a knife and fork ! @entity32 player @entity147 ( centre ) is tackled by two @entity153 defenders as he tries to break the line i ’m trying to get in the spirit of @entity156			1
i ’ve joined my @entity158 team - mates in the @entity159 , so hopefully we can raise some money			1
i like to think i have a bit of a @entity164 look , but really it ’s more of a top - lip slug ! @entity122 told the media on saturday that @entity168 , the @entity169 who has just joined @entity37 , needs to familiarise himself with the @entity35 banter before he joins up with the squad			1
my tip would be to come in with an open mind and not to spend too much time with @entity176 and @entity177 , because they have shocking banter			0
he should sit down for a coffee with @entity181 ; he is good craic and would definitely help him get to know the @entity35 way ! @entity32 coach @entity122 was watching on at the @entity36 as his side were beaten			1

@entity3 have become the forgotten team in our @entity6 group
but @entity32 know they pose a really danger if they are *n't* taken seriously
saturday is a chance for us to lay down our @entity6 marker
wales were beaten 33 - 28 by @entity27 at the @entity36 last week
