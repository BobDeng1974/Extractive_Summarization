by @entity1 reporter assistant coach @entity2 was disappointed to see rain curtail @entity5 's bid to build a big lead over @entity7 at @entity8 , but conceded it would have been dangerous to try and resume the match with conditions as they were			1
@entity5 had reached 237 for six and a first - innings lead of 85 over @entity7 when the players were forced off by a torrential downpour during the afternoon session on day two			1
although the rain stopped , large amounts of water collected on the outfield and the groundstaff could not get the playing area sufficiently ready for the match to resume and play was abandoned for the day following an inspection at 5.40pm			1
waterlogged : the downpour in @entity27 left the @entity8 outfield looking like a reservoir dark skies : the clouds stopped above @entity8 and unleashed a rain storm down on to the outfield rain stops play : assistant coach @entity2 would have liked to see @entity5 build a big day two lead that was frustrating for @entity5 and the crowd , but for @entity37 it was the right decision			1
asked if it the conditions in the affected areas were dangerous for the players , @entity39 told @entity44 : ' of course it is			2
' and the other thing is , i 'm sure the @entity47 would n't be too keen to see the ball keep disappearing into that , getting wet and boggy			0
' the umpires ca n't keep changing the ball every time it goes in there , and it would ruin the ball , the seam would become soft quickly , so i do n't think either team would really be pleased with that			0
delay : @entity59 ( right ) and @entity60 ( left ) leave the field after rain stopped play not long after lunch on friday ' it is a pity though because , so far , it 's been a very good game			1
the pitch is fantastic , it 's accelerated the game forward nicely and it was a good partnership developing between @entity69 ( @entity60 ) and @entity70 ( @entity59 ) there , so we did n't really want to come off when we did come off to be fair			1
' @entity59 was unbeaten on 48 when the players were forced off while @entity60 , playing in his second test , was 22 not out off 53 balls as he showed a different side to his game having hit a blistering 85 on debut			1
@entity2 said of the 23 - year - old wicketkeeper : ' i thought he was very watchful			0
@entity81 showed today that he really can fight , get stuck in , he 's a talented cricketer with so much to give			0
their partnership was just starting to go in the right direction today			0
' an 85 lead at this stage , i think we 're in a quite a good position , but we want to bat on and get as a big a lead as we can tomorrow			2
' on top : @entity59 is unbeaten on 48 for @entity5 as they lead @entity7 by 85 runs with four wickets in hand @entity96 clubbed a brilliant 123 but it proved to be in vain as @entity99 fell short in their run chase against @entity102 @entity101 the @entity104 wicket - keeper was comfortably @entity5 's highest scorer as they were bowled out for 260 in their pursuit of 282 , with only @entity108 ( 42 ) offering a semblance of support in a 22 - run defeat			1
it was harsh on @entity96 - one of @entity5 's match - winners when they beat @entity115 a in this triangular series on wednesday - that when his 116 - ball knock ended so did @entity5 's reply , but he could rest assured that he had done his bit , hitting 12 fours and two maximums along the way			1
@entity123 and @entity124 led the way in the bowling for the @entity127 , taking three each , as @entity5 consistently struggled - especially as they slumped to 48 for four			2
@entity129 assumed the @entity96 role of comfortably leading the scoring for @entity102 , hitting 115 with the nearest highest scorer being @entity133 with 42			0
@entity134 did his burgeoning reputation no harm with five wickets , although his economy rate of over six and over did not make such pleasant reading			0
@entity140 also chipped in with a couple of wickets but the chase was always going to be a tough one for @entity5			2
it proved to be that way too as @entity96 and @entity108 apart , the batsmen laboured , with six of them failing to make double figures			0
openers @entity148 and @entity150 made just eight between them , while @entity151 and @entity134 also failed in the middle order			0
in vain : @entity154 could n't save @entity99 from defeat at @entity156			0

@entity5 's assistant coach says @entity5 did n't want to come off the field
but he also *admits* playing on would have been dangerous for players
rain stopped play on day two at @entity8 with @entity5 in control
@entity59 and @entity60 were setting a good partnership but were halted
assistant still feels the home side are in a good position in the test
