book - sharing : @entity0 , pictured with his wife @entity1 , signed the £ 15million deal best - selling novelist @entity0 has signed a £ 15million agreement to produce six more books			1
and the twist in the tale is that he does n’t even have to write them himself			0
the 79 - year - old author , whose books have sold more than 122million copies since 1964 , has promised to produce up to two titles a year for three years with the help of ‘ carefully selected co-authors ’			1
@entity0 will reportedly sketch plot outlines and characters , leaving his appointed writers to flesh the skeletons out into full books			1
the new arrangement means his output of novels will dramatically rise , delighting his fans and adding to his fortune , already estimated at £ 100million - plus			2
but it will dismay literary purists – and appears to have been too much of a step for his previous publishers of 45 years , @entity27 , whom he has just left to join @entity30			2
the @entity31 suggested yesterday that a key figure in advocating the new scheme was @entity0 ’s fourth wife , @entity35 - born @entity1 , who is 39 years his junior			1
@entity0 ’s first hint at his plans to take more of a back seat in the novel writing process came last month , when he said on his website : ‘ i have plenty more books in my head clamouring to be written			2
' now @entity30 has announced that it is to publish six @entity0 books – the first being a sequel to his 1993 novel @entity47 , set in ancient @entity48 , and due to come out for christmas 2014 , marking his half century as an author			1
team : it has been suggested @entity1 , pictured with her husband at their @entity54 home has been a key figure in the new scheme @entity0 said : ‘ for the past few years my fans have made it very clear that they would like to read my novels and revisit my family of characters faster than i can write them			1
‘ for them , i am willing to make a change to my working methods so the stories in my head can reach the page more frequently			0
’ @entity0 married for the fourth time in 2000 , five months after the death of his third wife			2
he had spotted ‘ @entity70 ’ , as the former @entity69 is known , in @entity54 , and decided to approach her			0
fortuitously , she seems to have found the multi-millionaire instantly attractive			0
@entity0 recalled : ‘ i saw this nubile little @entity73 thing going down @entity74 and i joined her in the bookstore			0
’ a lunch invitation was soon followed by a successful proposal of marriage			0
the @entity81 - born author has said : ‘ with @entity82 beside me i look forward eagerly to each day			1
she is the perfect lover and companion			0
’ @entity0 is not the only blockbuster writer to share the creative load with others			0
thriller writer @entity89 has used a stable of co-authors to help produce some of his best - sellers , as have @entity93 and @entity94 .			1

the best - selling author will produce six books over the next three years
will *enlist* a group of ' carefully selected co-authors ' on the project
has been suggested his wife @entity1 is a key figure in the scheme
