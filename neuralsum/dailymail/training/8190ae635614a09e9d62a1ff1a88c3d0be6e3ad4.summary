critics are claiming that after @entity9 , the new action film starring father and son team @entity1 and @entity2 , which had meager earnings at the box office , bears striking similarities to the teachings of @entity12			1
the film opened to poor reviews and only earned $ 1m on opening night at the box office			0
film critics have pointed out several similarities between the film 's themes and @entity21 's religious teachings			1
critics have compared after @entity9 , starring @entity23 , to teachings of the @entity12			1
the film 's final scene ( pictured here ) features a volcano erupting , an iconic image from the religion founder , @entity21 's book , @entity32 after @entity9 , directed by @entity33 , tells the story of @entity35 ( played by @entity23 ) and his 13 - year - old son @entity36 ( @entity37 ) , who crash land on a @entity9 1,000 years after it has been abandoned by the human race			1
a former scientologist @entity41 reviewed the film for @entity44 and agreed that many of the themes are similar to @entity21 's teachings			1
@entity48 said he ' escaped ' from the organization which he was a part of for 15 years in 2005			0
after seeing the film he wrote for the magazine			0
' while most of the movie involves following @entity2 ’s character as he faces off against apes , a large , angry bird and a leech , ( none of which have much to do with @entity12 -- besides maybe the leech ) , most of the @entity12 influences play out in the film ’s dialogue			1
' @entity23 ’s character , @entity35 , tells his son , @entity36 : ' fear is not real			2
it is a product of thoughts you create			0
now do not misunderstand me : danger is very real			0
but fear is a choice '			0
' @entity21 ’s teachings insist that emotions and fear are triggers and are part of the reactive mind			0
through @entity12 , one is supposed to ' rid oneself of your fears ' ...			2
besides the film 's dialogue and its direct similarities to @entity12 teachings , there are also some other clues in after @entity9 that can not be ignored			1
' the movie ’s climax takes place on a volcano that could have been ripped right off the cover of @entity32 , the look is so similar			0
in @entity12 , the volcano is a common thread through many different teachings			2
' @entity23 ’s character is pretty much devoid of all emotions for the entire movie			2
while this may be part of his character or something that was directed in the script , in @entity12 , one goes through great amounts of training and counseling to control one ’s emotions and ' mis - emotion ' as described by @entity21			2
' now overrun by aliens who feed on fear , @entity113 must fight through the planet 's dangerous terrain to find the wrecked ship 's rescue beacon and save his father who was wounded in the crash			0
several film critics have dissected the plot and found numerous similarities to the teachings of @entity21 , the founder of the @entity12			1
the most glaring similarity is that the iconic image of a volcano erupting , featured on the cover of @entity21 's @entity32 , is the final climactic shot of the film			2
delving deeper , critics cite the film 's value on the self , derived from @entity12 , @entity133 noted			1
one of @entity21 's teachings was that people must set aside their doubts and conflicts and place unquestioned value on the self			1
in the film @entity145 is plagued by fear and self doubt as he travels through the alien terrain and tries to measure up to his general father			0
conversely @entity35 , the superior solider , is able to ' ghost ' or suppress his emotions			0
cypher classically embodies @entity21 's theory of ' thetan , ' or the pure human soul unburdened by emotion , whereas @entity113 is a ' misguided theatan , ' struggling to escape his fear			0
it is only as @entity36 learns to overcome his emotions over the course of the film that he experiences a @entity163 triumph of the self and success over the alien planet			0
critics also note the use of ' auditing ' in the film , which is the @entity12 's practice of ridding its members of painful emotional memories			1
@entity12 teaches that people are plagued by ' engrams , ' mental images similar to memories which can cause emotional pain			2
the @entity12 rids people of engrams through the use of an e-meter , commonly used in free @entity12 stress tests , that measures electrical resistance and pinpoints where the engrams live			2
after @entity35 is wounded in the spaceship crash he audits @entity36 from a far , helping him to move past his painful memories and find inner strength			0
@entity35 even has a equivalent of a 31st century e-meter with @entity36 's ' @entity193 ' suit that tracks his health stats			0
a third similiarity is that the predominant theme in the film is man - versus - nature , a basic @entity12 concept			1
in @entity12 life is divided into eight ' urges of survival , ' commonly known as dynamics			2
the first dynamic is self , the survival of the individual against all odds			0
in the film @entity36 outruns @entity9 's harsh environmental elements and dangerous wildlife hoards			2
the film suggests that he is able to overcome his external circumstances due to self - actualization and not an actual skill set			0
the film 's villains , blind aliens who both inspire and feed off of human fear are representative of @entity21 's condemnation of psychiatrists , who @entity21 wrote , ' advertise man as a push - button stimulus - response robot ' in the film @entity23 's character ' audits ' his son from afar , a @entity230 precept where someone helps you erase painful memories in order to find inner strength			1
in this scene @entity2 coaches his son from a video screen on the spaceship similar to an e-meter , used in @entity12 stress tests , the character 's ' @entity193 ' suit ( worn here ) allows @entity2 to track his son 's health stats and locate areas of stress in his body and mind finally critics noted that the film 's villains , monstrous aliens who feed off of people 's fears , are representative of @entity21 's aversion to psychiatry			1
@entity21 was famously outspoken against psychiatrists , writing in his paper crime and @entity260 that they ' advertise man as a push - button stimulus - response robot ' and use inhumane methods to manipulate people 's moods			2
in after @entity9 the blind , murderous aliens are akin to psychiatrists , feeding off people 's fear while also provoking them			0
religious overtones aside , after @entity9 failed to do well financially at the box office and opened to poor reviews			0
the @entity44 reported that on its opening night the film only grossed $ 1m , and may only debut at $ 35m , the lowest opening for @entity2 in his recent film history			2
the @entity277 summed up the movie in their review 's title stating , '' after @entity9 ' crashes on take - off			0
' @entity23 and son @entity2 pose together at the premiere of their new summer action flick , after @entity9			1
the film has been called a parable for @entity12 by critics			1
@entity2 has donated money to the church in the past , though he denies being a scientologist the @entity292 also condemned the film saying , ' @entity294 has its first bomb , and sadly , it ’s landed right on @entity23			1
' however the harshest review came from the @entity297 who criticized the film 's actors with a back - handed compliment for its director			0
reviewer @entity303 wrote , ' on the upside , this may be the first terrible movie by @entity33 that 's not primarily his fault			0
' this is not the first time that @entity2 has been closely associated with @entity12			1
in 2007 he donated $ 122,500 to church charities			0
then two years later @entity2 and his wife @entity311 opened the @entity312 in @entity313 , a private school based on @entity21 's teachings			1
despite @entity2 's philanthropic efforts involving the church he strongly denies being a practicing member			1
instead , in several interviews @entity2 has labeled himself as a ' student of world religion			1
' for their part the @entity12 says that " the subject of the film has no similarities with @entity12 whatsoever " .			1

critics are calling @entity23 's new action film *propaganda* for @entity12 's teachings
amongst the similarities are a focus on the self , themes of man versus nature , and ' auditing '
@entity2 denies any formal affiliation with the church , referring to himself as a ' student of world religion '
the @entity12 says " there are no similarities whatsoever "
