by @entity0 futuristic plans have been unveiled to build @entity3 's first ' floating village ' in the heart of @entity5			1
the scheme would turn the @entity7 , which was an industrial powerhouse for more than a century , into an array of brightly - coloured houses , paths and restaurants on giant concrete ' stilts '			2
but its unveiling today has sparked a furious row between @entity5 mayor @entity16 and local politicians , who say it will hasten @entity5 's slide into a millionaires ' playground			1
dramatic : plans have been unveiled for @entity3 's first ' floating village ' in the old industrial heart of east @entity5 who would live in a house like this ? each home would be custom - built and perched on top of concrete piles driven into the base of the 160 - year - old industrial dock - but there are fears over their high price the entire ' village ' - similar to many in the @entity38 - was described by mr @entity16 as floating but is set to be propped up on concrete piles driven underwater and through the floor of the dock			1
it 's claimed the 15 - acre site next to the @entity44 , @entity16 's prized cable car which was blasted by his critics as a white elephant , would become a ' thriving community ' with 50 homes , restaurants , cafes and bars			1
each building would be connected by bridges and there would be a large events venue in the shadow of the nearby 69,000 - capacity hall at the @entity59 , which hosted events for the @entity61			0
the luxury development would also feature offices , water sports , a floating @entity65 and even an ice rink			0
lead architect professor @entity67 , of @entity5 's @entity68 , designed the scheme after giving high - profile talks on floating villages in @entity72			1
multi-coloured : the ' village ' would include 50 custom - built homes and walkways , restaurants and bars @entity79 and new : but the scheme has sparked a row with local politicians who say it is only for the super-rich it would be similar to a ' floating village ' in @entity87 , @entity38 , with each luxury house built off - site and shipped into place			1
but the scheme has been blasted today as a ' yuppie ghetto ' by the mayor of the borough of @entity93 - which will decide whether to grant planning permission next spring			2
sir @entity95 said : ' we have always been clear that any new development must provide affordable housing and an acceptable mix of uses along with much needed long - term jobs for local people			2
mayor @entity16 said the scheme would host some of @entity5 's most sought - after homes ' the current plans for the @entity106 do not meet our vision or the @entity109 's own @entity108			1
' @entity110 can not , and will not , accept a development consisting purely of luxury apartments which will be out of reach of the majority of our residents			0
' @entity5 mayor @entity16 's office was unable to say exactly what percentage of the scheme will be affordable at this stage			1
but each house will be custom - built to its buyer 's demands , raising the price , and the development will be surrounded by ' a blue water square , framed by a market square and a floating corniche			0
' a spokesman for mr @entity16 insisted : ' the mayor wants to ensure a significant proportion of low cost homes within this exciting new development , with social housing provider @entity134 on board , and a commitment from @entity138 to recycle all financial receipts from the scheme back into it for affordable homes and commercial space			1
' dug out in the heart of east @entity5 near what is now the financial hub @entity146 , the @entity7 opened in 1855 and was a key part of @entity149 's powerful shipping trade			1
the first of the ' royal docks ' , it was followed by the @entity152 and @entity153			0
together they became the largest enclosed docks in the world and reached their peak in the 1950s			0
but as @entity3 's economy radically changed after the @entity159 the docks declined , and by 1978 they were losing £ 9million a year			2
cargo gradually stopped being shipped up the @entity161 and went instead to sites further downriver including @entity163 in @entity164 , which is now home to a gigantic container terminal			0
as it is now : opened 1855 , the @entity7 is now part of the largest enclosed docks in the world			0
pictured centre is the vast @entity59 venue , which opened in 2000 and hosted sports for the @entity61 dramatic past : troops unloading the @entity175 during a strike at the @entity7 in 1949 @entity177 , the director of @entity178 , said : ' living in a floating home you 've helped to design is a dream lots of us have			0
' by combining the floating home experience of our @entity38 collaborators with our custom built business we hope to make these dreams come true in @entity7 for a few lucky @entity190			0
' @entity5 's place on the tourist trail is growing fast			2
it 's about to be joined by @entity195 ’s largest floating village , with floating markets , creative workspace , events and watersports			0
' the @entity5 mayor added : ' this site has the potential to become one of the most sought after addresses in the capital while breathing new life back into @entity5 ’s waterways			2

*multi-million* pound scheme in @entity210 , east @entity5 , to be @entity3 first
set to include 50 multi-coloured homes perched on top of concrete piles
but it was blasted by local mayor for not having enough affordable homes
