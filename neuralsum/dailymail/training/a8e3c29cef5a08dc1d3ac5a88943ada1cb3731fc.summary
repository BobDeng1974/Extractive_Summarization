@entity0 has staged a tongue - in - cheek ' come and fight me ' plea to @entity4 as the @entity6 pound - for - pound king closes in on a multi-million dollar fight with @entity8			1
it is understood undefeated five - division world champion @entity10 is ready to complete terms with @entity8 's promoter @entity12 in @entity13 on friday for a may 2 superfight			1
but @entity15 is keen to muscle in , attempting to goad the 37 - year - old @entity18 and @entity19 welterweight champion into taking him on instead of the 36 - year - old @entity22 @entity21 holder			0
@entity0 is interviewed during a promotion event for boxing company @entity24 @entity0 calls out @entity10 , telling him to accept a fight against him this year @entity0 taunts @entity10 by wearing a mask of the pound - for - pound king and holding a bundle of cash @entity0 has been long hoping for a fight against the world 's best boxer in a video seen exclusively by @entity34 from boxing suppliers @entity24 , @entity0 comically dons a facemask of @entity10 and holds out a wad of money in hand			1
he then attempts to goad his illusive opponent further , whilst pointing at a giant wall projection spelling out ' who are ya ? ' as he looks to up the pressure on the @entity6 to give in and fight him			2
despite the @entity47 hero 's best efforts , @entity10 is likely to snub @entity0 and give boxing fans the bout they have long - awaited			1
@entity10 has previously been dismissive about @entity0 despite the 28 - year - old 's impressive victory over @entity52 last december			1
@entity18 silver welterweight holder @entity0 is determined to become a world champion again but may have to be patient in his bid to conquer either @entity10 or @entity8 with a fight against fellow @entity58 @entity57 - the @entity59 champion - a possibility later this year			1
indeed , @entity0 will be an interested bystander once @entity10 and @entity8 eventually lock horns			1
the pair are expected to clash this spring in the @entity6 's hometown of @entity64 at the @entity65 in a mega-fight worth at least $ 300million ( Â£ 197m )			2
@entity10 wants to fight on may 2 , the saturday closest to the @entity68 holiday , as has been his tradition in recent years			1
but that date has also been earmarked for @entity72 's proposed clash with @entity73 which would be one of the biggest fights in the history of the @entity79 - @entity78 rivalry			2
@entity10 said last month : ' the public want this fight			1
the only stumbling block has been @entity12 ( @entity8 's promoter ) but i think both fighters want it			1
so it 's time to get it on			2
i 'm not ducking anyone , so let 's get this on			2
years ago we had problems with random blood and urine testing			0
i just want to have an even playing field			0
as @entity0 goaded @entity10 , a giant projection mocking the @entity97 appeared on the wall those present at the promotional event also got involved by wearing their own @entity10 masks @entity0 ( left ) appeared in good spirits during the event ' now he 's in a very , very tight situation with his loss to ( @entity106 and his loss to ( @entity109 ) @entity108			1
his pay - per - view numbers are extremely low , so he 's desperate			2
i wanted that fight a long time ago			0
' reports in @entity6 over the weekend suggested the venue had been agreed , as well as a drug testing programme			0
the final stumbling block appears to be the purse split with @entity10 refusing to agree to a 50/50 division			1
but @entity8 has long been adamant that he would accept the smaller portion in order to end more than five years of debate since the fight was first mooted			1
before @entity122 he told @entity123 : ' @entity10 can get the amount he wants			2
i challenged him to a charity fight			0
until now , he has not agreed to it			0
' so , money is not the issue in our fight			0
this fight is about legacy , this is about making the fans happy and , above all , this is for the good of boxing			2
@entity0 is likely to miss out on his chance to fight @entity10 , who looks set to face @entity8 ' he has reached a dead end			1
he has nowhere to run but to fight me			0
i will try my best to make this a thrilling and entertaining fight			0
but i doubt if he 's gon na engage me in a slugfest			0
you all know his fighting style			0
most of his previous fights , if not all , induced us to sleep			0
' i know what i have to do			0
i will chase him wherever he goes just in case he decides to run around the ring			0
we will devise a good fight plan against him			0
' @entity0 will be more than willing to step in , however , if negotiations break down between boxing 's long - standing arch - rivals .			1

@entity34 has exclusive video of @entity0 mocking @entity10
@entity0 : ' shut up @entity10 , let 's get this fight on in 2015 '
@entity10 reported to be close to agreeing deal to fight @entity8
@entity0 : @entity10 has five days to decide if he wants to fight me
