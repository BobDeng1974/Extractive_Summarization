tragedy : miss @entity1 was found dead days after receiving a hoax phone call at @entity4 's king edward vii hospital an inquiry has been launched by @entity7 ’s media watchdog today into a radio station 's prank call to the @entity11 's hospital , which was followed by the apparent suicide of a nurse			1
the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) will examine whether radio station @entity15 and staff were in breach of broadcasting licence conditions			1
the station risks being shut down if found to have broken the rules			1
@entity14 is also expected to ask @entity15 ’s parent company , @entity21 , to name those responsible for approving broadcast of the hoax call			1
@entity14 's chairman , mr @entity24 , said it would be examining ‘ whether the licensee has complied with its broadcasting obligations			1
’ miss @entity1 was found dead days after receiving a hoax phone call at @entity4 ’s king edward vii hospital from @entity30 djs @entity29 and @entity31			1
she and another nurse in the ward where the @entity34 of @entity35 was being treated for morning sickness believed they were talking to the @entity38 and prince @entity39 , despite the unimpressive attempts by the @entity41 to imitate the royals			0
although @entity44 has repeatedly apologised for the ‘ tragic , regrettable death ’ of the nurse and has committed at least $ 500,000 ( £ 326,000 ) to a memorial fund for her family , the media watchdog has shown its determination to dig deeper into the scandal			1
the radio show 's producers and lawyers on duty at the time of the hoax are expected to be questioned			1
the watchdog will be referring heavily to the radio broadcasting code , particular a part which states that it is a breach to record a person in conversation , and also air it , without their knowledge			1
section 6.1 of the code states that ‘ a licensee must not broadcast the words of an identifiable person unless that person has been informed in advance or a reasonable person would be aware that the words may be broadcast			1
’ the section adds that there must not be a broadcast unless , ‘ in the case of words which have been recorded without the knowledge of the person , that person has subsequently , but prior to the broadcast , expressed consent to the broadcast of the word			2
’ the station ’s parent company has said it attempted to contact the hospital five times following the hoax call to discuss it , but had not been able to speak to anyone			1
mother - of - two @entity102 , 46 , was found hanged at her hospital apartment last friday morning , just days after the hoax call and left a note for her family			2
she had not told her husband or children that she was involved in the incident , meaning the letter may provide their only clue to what prompted the respected nurse to take such a drastic and tragic step			0
@entity21 has since pledged to donate $ 500,000 ( £ 326,000 ) from its advertising profits to her family			0
condolences : the @entity120 and @entity11 sent their condolences to the @entity1 family following the death of nurse @entity1 who worked on the ward where the @entity11 was being treated for morning sickness @entity127 , the company 's chief executive officer said how sorry they were for what had happened			2
' it is a terrible tragedy and our thoughts continue to be with the family			0
' we hope that by contributing to a memorial fund we can help to provide the @entity1 family with the support they need at this very difficult time			0
' the company reiterates that it is deeply saddened by this tragic and unforeseen event and offers its condolences to the family of @entity102			0
' @entity21 also cancelled the @entity15 's @entity144 out of respect for @entity1 , and donate the cash to two @entity7 charities that handle emotional , life threatening problems			1
as much as £ 8,000 had been set aside to entertain between 200 and 250 of the radio station 's staff , before executives decided the party would be inappropriate			1
before the nurse 's death , mr @entity31 said he expected the hoax would be the highlight of his career , and might have expected jubilant celebration at the end of year party			1
instead , a company spokesperson said : ' cancellation of the party was entirely out of respect for the nurse , @entity102 , and her family			0
this is not a time for celebration at the radio station			1
' the party was due to be held at a trendy nightclub called the @entity172 on @entity30 's popular nightlife strip , @entity174			2
bereft : all the profits from the radio station 's advertising will be donated to nurse @entity102 's family			1
pictured centre , her husband @entity180 visits @entity183 with their children @entity185 , left , 14 , and @entity186 , right , 16 lord @entity187 , chairman of the hospital where miss @entity1 worked , welcomed news of @entity191 's donation to the family			2
he said : ' @entity102 was an outstanding nurse who was much loved by everyone at @entity195			0
' after discussion with her family , we have established the @entity200 to benefit her husband and children at this difficult time			0
i am pleased to announce that many donations have already been made from around the world			0
' i have read that @entity191 have pledged to make a minimum donation of $ 500,000 @entity7 dollars to an appropriate fund			0
we would certainly welcome such a donation			0
' meanwhile @entity211 spokesman , @entity212 mp @entity210 , said mrs @entity1 's family were demanding answers from the hospital about the circumstances that led to her death			2
although bosses at the hospital in @entity224 have said they will conduct internal inquiries , the nurse 's family – husband @entity220 , 49 , and children @entity186 , 17 , and @entity185 , 14 – ' want to know everything '			2
mr @entity210 , who has met hospital chairman @entity187 to demand a full inquiry , said : ' what the chairman of the hospital said to me was that there are inquiries going on in the hospital			2
' that is not sufficient for the family			0
the family want to know everything			0
all the facts , fully and clearly			0
' mr @entity210 added : ' the hospital needs to be more pro-active , a full inquiry is needed and the family need to be included in that			2
' they are a lovely close - knit family , a @entity248 family who will be spending their first @entity144 without their mother , and for @entity220 , without his wife			0
' difficult time : in a @entity255 interview , mr @entity210 ( centre ) said mr @entity180 ( left ) - along with @entity185 and @entity256 ( right ) - had been left ' shocked and bewildered ' after mrs @entity1 was found dead at nurses ' housing last friday morning			0
