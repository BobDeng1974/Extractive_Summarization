' @entity1 gene ' : couples attending an exhibition are expected to be keen to discover if they could produce red - headed children couples are being offered dna tests to see if they are carrying the ‘ ginger gene ’			1
organisers of a heritage show are bracing themselves for an influx of couples keen to discover if they could produce red - headed children			0
carriers of the gene variant can have ginger children even if neither parent has red hair			1
a simple dna test , available at the @entity18 ? live exhibition at @entity21 in @entity22 next month , can identify carriers			1
dr @entity24 , chief scientist at @entity25 – the ancestry company behind the test – said : ‘ through a simple saliva test to determine deep ancestry , we can also identify whether an individual is a carrier of any of the three common red - head variants in the gene @entity33			2
‘ this means that families can carry a variant for generations , and when one carrier has children with another carrier , a red - headed baby can appear seemingly out of nowhere			0
’ it is estimated that about four in ten people carry the red - head gene variant without having red hair themselves – accounting for many surprise births of babies who are red - headed			1
about 40 per cent of men and women in @entity51 carry a red head variant , but only 10 per cent have red hair			1
in @entity53 , just over 30 per cent are known carriers and up to 13 per cent have red hair , while in @entity55 only 6 per cent of people have red hair			2
on the @entity58 , only about 1.3 per cent of people are red - headed , getting much rarer heading towards the south - east			0
when counting the entire world population only just over 0.5 per cent ( one in 200 ) have red hair , which is nearly 40million people			0
identifying carriers : couples can get dna tests to see if they are carrying the ' ginger gene ' ( file picture ) about one in four of the children of two carriers will be born with red hair and half will themselves be carriers			1
' families can carry a variant for generations , and when one carrier has children with another carrier , a red - headed baby can appear seemingly out of nowhere ' dr @entity24 , @entity25 half of the children of a carrier will also inherit the variant , even if their other parent is not a carrier			2
recent research indicates millions of @entity85 carry ‘ silent ’ genes for redheadedness			0
while this does not turn their hair ginger , it may expose them to a range of increased health risks that afflict redheads			0
these can include increased sensitivity to pain , skin cancer , parkinson ’s disease and even @entity102 ’s syndrome .			0

about 40 *%* of us carry gene variant without having red hair ourselves
