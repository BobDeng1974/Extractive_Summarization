by @entity1 reporter published : 02:10 est , 18 february 2013 updated : 02:10 est , 18 february 2013 instead of switching off the tv , parents may just need to switch the channel their kids are watching if they want to see improved behavior			1
a study at the @entity8 has found that parents who switched their kids ' television from the violent stuff to more educational programming can improve preschoolers ' behavior			1
more or less : @entity17 was part of a @entity20 study that wanted to know if changing , not reducing , tv habits could improve kids ' behavior the modest but promising results may lead to ways to avoid aggressive and violent behavior in young children			1
' it 's not just about turning off the television			0
it 's about changing the channel ' said lead author dr. @entity31 , a pediatrician and researcher involved in the study			1
new rule : @entity17 's sister @entity35 ( right ) also participated in the study that taught parents to modulate their kids ' television habits the research was to be published online monday by the journal @entity43			1
the study involved 565 @entity20 parents , who periodically filled out tv - watching diaries and questionnaires measuring their child 's behavior			1
@entity50 were coached for six months on getting their 3 - to - 5 - year - old kids to watch shows like ' @entity54 ' and ' @entity55 ' rather than more violent programs like ' @entity57			1
' toy time : @entity35 and @entity17 's mom @entity59 ( right ) says her kids now play with toys more often because what the study taught her the results were compared with kids whose parents who got advice on healthy eating instead			2
at six months , children in both groups showed improved behavior , but there was a little bit more improvement in the group that was coached on their tv watching			2
too soon : the study 's findings were modest but may pave the way toward curbing aggressive behavior in children by one year , there was no meaningful difference between the two groups overall			1
low - income boys appeared to get the most short - term benefit			0
' that 's important because they are at the greatest risk , both for being perpetrators of aggression in real life , but also being victims of aggression , ' @entity31 said			0
but the study has some flaws			0
the parents were n't told the purpose of the study , but authors concede they probably figured it out and that might have affected the results			0
before the study , the children averaged about 1Â½ hours of tv , video and computer game watching a day , with violent content making up about a quarter of that time			1
by the end of the study , that increased by up to 10 minutes			0
those in the tv coaching group increased their time with positive shows ; the healthy eating group watched more violent tv			2
@entity118 , who took part with her now 6 - year - old daughter , said the study was a wake - up call			0
' i did n't realize how much @entity35 was watching and how much she was watching on her own , ' she said			0
baby steps : researchers admit the study had flaws but some say its a smarter alternative to research that seeks to demonize nearly all tv @entity17 said her daughter 's behavior improved after making changes , and she continues to control what @entity35 and her 2 - year - old brother , @entity17 , watch			1
she also decided to replace most of @entity35 's tv time with games , art and outdoor fun			0
during a recent visit to their @entity20 home , the children seemed more interested in playing with blocks and running around outside than watching tv			2
dr. @entity146 , director of the @entity147 at @entity148 , was not involved in this study but works on similar research and commended the @entity20 team 's efforts			0
' because no one 's going to stop watching tv , we have to have viable alternatives for kids			2

@entity8 study finds that children who watch educational tv are less prone to violent or aggressive
though modest , the study could one day lead to ways to help *prevent* kids from becoming violent *adults*
