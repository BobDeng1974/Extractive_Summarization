@entity1 managing director @entity0 can understand @entity4 owner @entity3 's frustrations and has vowed there will be ' no surrender ' in a bid to right their current wretched wrongs			1
in sunday 's @entity10 , @entity1 suffered two blown engines as first @entity4 's @entity12 was forced out of the race , followed late on by @entity15 's @entity14			1
it was yet further embarrassment for @entity1 who are under pressure to perform after @entity4 's billionaire benefactor @entity3 threatened to pull out of @entity20 unless the @entity22 manufacturer raised their game			1
@entity4 team principal @entity24 has been critical of @entity1 this season the fact @entity1 powered @entity4 to four consecutive drivers ' and constructors ' championships from 2010 - 2013 is a thing of the past			1
instead , the focus is now on their problems , leading to @entity4 team principal @entity24 hauling in @entity35 to explain the woes in a post-race media debrief normally solely reserved for him			1
asked about @entity3 's threat , @entity0 said : ' i understand his position and frustration , and to a certain degree i 'm sure @entity1 's board could share the same frustration			1
' we understand we have issues			2
those issues are supposed to be addressed by some of the many things going on at @entity50			2
@entity12 and @entity52 squabble with the mclarens of @entity54 ( left ) and @entity55 ' there are things waiting to happen			1
there is a plan , and we need to understand if that plan is commensurate with the issues we 've seen on track			2
' this plan was more focused on power because we saw that was where we were missing			2
we 've got all the driveability issues completely out of the way			2
' now we need to understand the reliability issues because a problem with reliability is bad for @entity72 ' also when you have to address reliability issues you 're not necessarily in a position to address power , which is also still missing			0
' @entity52 ( left ) and @entity78 jostle for position - the latter was forced to retire after an engine failure it means @entity4 's problems seem to continue in the short term , leaving @entity24 to state : ' the solution is we get our heads down and we work hard			1
' from @entity4 's point of view , we 'll offer as much support in the relevant areas as we can			1
' it 's a s * * * * y position to be , but we 've just got to engineer our way out of it			0
' @entity35 is aware the two failures at the @entity95 will be addressed , adding : ' we 've just got to analyse what happened a little bit			0
' it looks like the two issues are similar			0
we need to have a clear understanding			0
' but we knew we had this reliability risk above our heads			0
obviously it struck today , not the best day			0
it 's a tough business			0
but we will not surrender			0
we are in this together and we will hopefully fight back			0
