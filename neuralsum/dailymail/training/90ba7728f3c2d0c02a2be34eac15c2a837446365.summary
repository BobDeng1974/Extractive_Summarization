a quiet revolution is taking place on the @entity2			1
as you walk past shop windows , you may spot it : sleeves on dresses , flattering fits that are looser on the waist , and campaign shots that feature greying models			1
elegant clothes for grown - ups , rather than styles for youthful fashion victims			1
and look around at who ’s actually carrying bags , or shopping in giggling packs with friends — it ’s not teenagers			0
they ’re either buying online , or counting their pennies			0
@entity24 , 49 , is the face of @entity26 the @entity2 is steadily being reclaimed by the 50 - plus women it abandoned years ago			1
and no wonder : figures just this month revealed these women now spend £ 2.7 billion on clothes — accounting for 41 per cent of sales — with a staggering 90 per cent of @entity35 retailers seeing their fastest growth from this age group			1
suddenly , shops are pulling out all the stops for a slice of the @entity41			0
for they ’ve finally realised the over- 50 woman — more likely to walk in , run her fingers over fabrics , and try on in dressing rooms , as opposed to buying blindly online before returning items ( a huge hassle for retailers ) — is the most desirable customer on the @entity2			1
for stores that win her heart , the rewards are considerable			0
@entity54 , aimed at the over- 50s , has seen profits up 66 per cent in a year and even @entity57 is starting to reap the benefits of its leading ladies campaign which featured @entity60 , 59 , @entity61 , 55 , and @entity62 , 61 , with clothing sales returning to growth for the first time in three years			1
@entity67 ’s ‘ face ’ @entity68 , who is fast approaching 50 , is also a prime example of a new breed of mature woman			1
‘ women over 75 are now shopping as frequently as those in their teens and 20s were in the @entity79 , ’ says the @entity73 ’s professor @entity72 , author of @entity74			2
‘ now , the lives of those in their 60s are not immensely different from those in their 40s			0
‘ it ’s a difficult ask for the @entity2			1
they ’ve got to promote clothes that do n’t have a label that says : “ this is a frumpy dress for an older woman ” , and yet cut in a way that flatters older figures			1
‘ the over- 50s are not a funny little niche to be pandered to , but a market every bit as stylish , active and alert as their daughters — and with more disposable income			1
’ @entity101 is a case in point : in its new campaign , former fashion photographer @entity104 , 70 , looks directly at the camera , every bit as confident as her supermodel daughter @entity109 , beside her			1
the message is unequivocal : these are clothes that flatter older women , but are still fashion - forward enough to be desirable to her thirtysomething daughter			1
in fact , it seems the trick is to make this explicit enough to bring customers in , yet subtle enough to avoid offending said customers by telling them they ’re ‘ old ’			0
like much of the fashion industry — from @entity57 to @entity124 and @entity125 — @entity101 chased the glamour of youth and abandoned its core customer in the @entity129			1
‘ we tried to go too young , too fashionable — and that was a disaster , ’ admits ceo @entity130			0
‘ we had to rethink			0
’ @entity133 , 50 , modelling for @entity135 the result is an autumn / winter collection that uses forgiving cuts and will work across generations , with a return to natural fabrics — more breathable , which can be useful for menopausal women			1
a simple grey jacket , £ 220 , for example , is eminently wearable , but has details , such as raglan sleeves , that make it modern			2
but , while quality is often cited as an overriding concern for mature women , professor @entity72 also says much of the trick to luring back the over- 50s is a good , old - fashioned bargain			1
while the babyboomer generation may be richer than their parents , they have also experienced 15 years of fast fashion , so are less willing to blow their pensions on one or two good items			1
and the section of the industry that responded first to that need was the catalogue and mail - order scene			2
the @entity168 of brands such as @entity135 ( which has signed up @entity133 as a model ) @entity172 and @entity173 & @entity174 has long been offering a huge range of clothes carefully designed to fit the more mature figure , without losing out on the fun factor — providing an alternative to @entity180 that , until recently , has made older women feel so unwelcome			1
they have helped spark a reassessment of just what the older woman wants to wear , exactly how it should fit , and how she shops			2
at @entity135 , contemporary fashions adapted for a more mature figure are key			0
what that means is more forgiving waists on well - tailored skirts and trousers , perhaps with hidden elastic or drawstring for flexibility , to account for the general redistribution of fat from hips to waist			2
other popular features include secret support on jeans , lower bust darts to lift breasts , shaping panels on dresses , sleeves , longer hemlines , and slimming style details , such as bold patterns and ruching on the waist			0
fabrics , too , are often less flimsy , with heavier cotton jersey , quilting , or knits that skim the body , rather than cling			0
vibrant colours that flatter the skin and subtle neutrals are more popular than harsh black , which highlights wrinkles			0
‘ for our customers , looking good is a daily deal you make with yourself , ’ says @entity224 of upmarket @entity173 & @entity174			0
‘ you can become “ invisible ” , and fall prey to bland , shapeless clothing , or you can rock what you ’ve got			0
’ and this successful formula , which started among mail - order catalogues , now spans the @entity2			1
stores that have become huge successes , such as @entity124 , @entity238 ’s @entity237 , @entity239 in a @entity240 , @entity241 and even @entity243 ’s spin - off cos are packed with stylish , older women seeking out contemporary fashion , safe in the knowledge that the styles will fit and suit them			1
@entity57 is starting to reap the benefits of its leading ladies campaign , which featured baroness @entity62 , 61 ( right ) @entity61 , 55 , and @entity60 , 59 , starred in @entity57 's @entity250 campaign perhaps one of the most telling examples of this sea change is jeans , once a youth staple			2
now , they are available in styles — and with stretch and panelling — that flatter more mature figures			2
the options are seemingly endless : @entity262 alone has everything from super-soft jeggings in its @entity266 line for £ 18 , to high - waisted bootcut jeans by not your daughter ’s jeans for £ 150 , while shape - boosting denim is available everywhere from @entity57 in classic black for £ 35 , @entity268 in chic purple for £ 125			1
this effect is not confined to clothing , either : @entity276 , managing director at @entity278 shoes , has noted a distinct change in the requirements of his customers in recent years — they are now taking style tips from their daughters , unlike the more formal pre-war generation , who took their dress sense from their mothers			2
over 50s are getting younger in their attitude and lifestyles ( posed by model ) ‘ one of the best - selling shoes we have is a canvas - print , which has stretch panels in the side , and can be worn by anyone from an 18 - year - old to an 80 - year - old , ’ he says			2
‘ our customers loved our comfort , but wanted more style			0
’ eighty per cent of over- 50s have problems with their legs and feet , according to @entity276 , though most simply do n’t recognise that their feet are changing shape			1
‘ how we tackle that is the design of our shoes , ’ he says			0
‘ we ’ve done a lot of research in what is the right fit for people — things like the toebox area , that ’s where there can be a lot of change and you need more room			0
other considerations are adjustability , with @entity327 , for example			0
’ other traditionally comfortable shoe brands are also upping the glam factor in search of the grey pound : @entity57 ’s sturdy @entity334 range , for example , has had something of a makeover , with shoes every bit as stylish as the main range — but hidden benefits , including wider shapes , softer materials and @entity344 soft innersoles			0
‘ the generation now hitting their 50s are getting even younger in their attitude and lifestyles , ’ says @entity276			2
‘ they ’re highly active and highly social			0
their footwear wardrobe is widening because they want a particular product for a particular aspect of their life , whether that ’s adventure holidays , lunch with friends , fancy dinners , or fitness			0
’ professor @entity72 agrees : ‘ a lot of the work on old age tends to focus on problematic things ; difficulties — all very important , but it misses the fact that later years , for many people , are n’t necessarily problematic , but do contain all sorts of good things such as choices about clothing , leisure , those sort of things			0
’ finally , it seems , the @entity2 has caught up .			2

shop windows are boasting elegant clothes for grown - ups , rather than styles for youthful fashion victims
major campaign shots are featuring older models such as @entity389 , 50 , or @entity68 , 49
the @entity2 is steadily being reclaimed by the 50 - plus women it abandoned years ago
over- 50s women spend £ 2.7 billion on clothes , accounting for 41 *%* of sales
