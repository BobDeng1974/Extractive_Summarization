@entity1 author @entity0 says the @entity3 hack threatens us all if society does n't enforce important values : our individual and collective freedom of expression and an unwavering refusal to negotiate with anonymous terrorists			1
the best - selling author said friday that he was prepared to make himself an example — even if it meant inviting criticism and potential threats — if @entity16 had taken him up on his $ 100,000 offer for the rights to its cancelled film			1
defending these values is a matter of the highest concern for ' everyone on the planet , everyone who believes in freedom of expression , ' he said , drawing parallels with the plight of fellow author @entity30 , who spent years in hiding after his novel @entity32 drew death threats from the @entity35 government			2
' i thought that they could take the offer so as not to lose face , ' @entity0 said			1
' you know , " in a gesture of good will , we are going to accept $ 100,000 even if we put $ 44 million in this movie because we believe in freedom of information			1
" ... tomorrow the film would be there			0
' the author of @entity67 acknowledged he would have been afraid if he had released the film , particularly because he travels and could be vulnerable , but he would have been more ashamed of himself if he did n't at least try			1
' so live with fear or live with shame ? better to live with fear , ' he said at his luxury @entity74 home , where his phone and internet service were mysteriously out of service in an apparent attack directed at him			0
' in the name of something that is more important than i am , as a physical person			0
' @entity3 defended its decision after president @entity84 said during a press conference that the studio had ' made a mistake ' in dropping @entity42 , a satirical film about a plot to assassinate @entity90 's leader , and he pledged the @entity91 would respond ' in a place and manner and time that we choose ' to the attack that led to the withdrawal			1
the @entity98 blamed the hack on the communist government			0
@entity3 said the cancellation happened only because the country 's top theater chains pulled out			2
' this was their decision , ' @entity3 said in a statement			2
vocal : the @entity1 author said in an interview that the hacking of @entity3 threatens everyone @entity0 made clear he was n't defending the movie itself but rather that he decried the ' culture of fear ' and apparent willingness to ' negotiate with terrorists ' that he said undercuts people 's freedom of expression and the principle of not negotiating with terrorists			1
he also expressed admiration for actor @entity125 's attempt to highlight the same values of sticking one 's neck out to defend our freedom of information by putting forward a petition for @entity134 bigwigs to sign — though none did			0
@entity125 said the entertainment industry should seek release of @entity139 online , telling the trade site deadline that he urged @entity3 to ' do whatever you can to get this movie out			2
not because everybody has to see the movie , but because i 'm not going to be told we ca n't see the movie			0
that 's the most important part			0
' @entity0 said he was unable to reach any executives to discuss the decision not to screen the film before a projected december 25 release , but he thinks the studio ignored his offer because of fear that more @entity3 hacked e-mails would be divulged			1
' what i 'm doing here is much more a kind of political statement : fight for you rights , ' he said			0
' we live in a moment where fear rules , and this can not continue			0

@entity0 has revealed that he offered @entity3 $ 100,000 for the film rights to the interview
