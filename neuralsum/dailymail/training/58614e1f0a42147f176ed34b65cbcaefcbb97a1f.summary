one day after the former @entity6 champion revealed the 33 - year - old married @entity8 architect @entity7 in the @entity9 , he shared a few details about how he kept the wedding a surprise , and how he managed to go three months before anyone found out			1
he said there was n't a proposal , it was more like a conversation			2
as for a honeymoon ? they live part of the year in a place most couples go for their honeymoon , so felt no need to take another			2
' so there were no real plans for any of that			0
we 'll just keep on going			0
' and of the actual ceremony - the parents were aware where they were heading that day , but no one else was			1
' it was a week where we knew some people would be around that we wanted and we kept it a secret for a couple of months and then surprised them on the day , ' smiled @entity2			1
' we just said we were having a party , so come on over , ' @entity2 added			1
' so then they had no idea that it was going to happen			0
so that was the fun little game for me and @entity7 to play for a while , planning it and stuff			1
' they were married april 17 , the thursday after the @entity3 tied for 14th at the masters			1
@entity58 open champion @entity56 , one of his best friends , was invited to the party but did n't attend			1
he did n't know it was a wedding - so the secret did n't work out well for everyone			1
for being one of the most popular players in the game , @entity2 does n't seek a lot of attention			1
life is like a honeymoon : the couple ( pictured in january ) wo n't be taking a honeymoon because their usual life is fabulous enough , @entity2 said hardly anyone sees him when he 's not playing golf			1
he typically retreats to his home in the @entity9 or in @entity79			0
after becoming the first @entity3 to win the masters , he waited until the end of the year to return home to @entity83			0
@entity84 announced his engagement on @entity86			0
he was asked if he would wait a month before he told anyone he was married			2
' no , but @entity2 is a little different than me , ' @entity84 said			2
i do n't know how he kept it a secret for so long from you guys			2
' i had breakfast with him this morning			0
it was nice to be able congratulate him			0
he was telling me he had to tell lie after lie just to keep it quiet			0
' @entity2 said that part was n't planned			1
on the green : golfer @entity2 of @entity3 watches his tee shot on the fifth hole in @entity103 on sunday , following his wedding last month secret wedding : @entity2 ( pictured playing golf on sunday ) married @entity7 on april 17 and did n't even tell their guests what the party was for ' we just wanted it to be a secret for the day , and then we have n't told anyone to keep it a secret since , ' he said			1
' but i think people did n't want to do the wrong thing by me			0
so i 've got them right where i want them			0
' he has not played since the masters , keeping to the same schedule as last year			0
when he showed up at @entity125 , he was not wearing a ring			0
' we have rings , but i 've never played with one , so i was n't going to start this week , ' @entity2 said			1
' we 'll see if it makes it to the course or not			0
' @entity2 's bride did not travel to a lot of golf tournaments when they first were dating more than a decade ago , and he said that probably would n't change			1

the golf was n't bad , either			2
@entity2 got off to a rough start saturday and finished strong for a 69			2
he was 3 - under par , still with an outside chance at finishing high enough to replace @entity145 at no. 1 in the world ranking next week .			0
