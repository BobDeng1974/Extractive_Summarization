by @entity0 published : 08:09 est , 19 march 2014 updated : 08:58 est , 19 march 2014 a gecko so small it can fit on the end of a pencil has been drawing a lot of attention			1
the tiny reptile is called the @entity8 , or the @entity10 leaf tailed , gecko due to its point raised ' brow ridges '			1
in the wild they are masters of camouflage and mimic dead leaves and twigs			2
the @entity8 , or the @entity10 leaf tailed , gecko is so small it can sit on the head of a pencil their legs look like little branches and their tails look just like dead leaves – all the way down to having veins and raggedy edges			1
it was born at @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity34 , last month and will soon be on display once it grows a bit bigger			1
a zoo spokesman said : ‘ leaf - tailed geckos are found only on @entity40 where populations are decreasing mainly due to habitat loss caused by logging , agriculture and cattle grazing			2
the gecko is so small that sometimes staff at the zoo have difficulty finding it the fantastic , or @entity51 leaf tailed , gecko is native to @entity40 and was first described in 1888 by @entity52 ( 1858 - 1937 ) , a @entity53 zoologist , who said it was ‘ mythical ’ because of its unique look			1
its scientific name is @entity58 – meaning imaginary flat tail			2
geckos have no eyelids and so they use their long , mobile tongues to wipe away any dust or debris that gets into the eye			0
it is a nocturnal animal feeding on insects such as crickets and moths			0
. when faced with a predator , it flattens its body to reduce its shadow , shows off its red mouth or sheds its tail			0
‘ they are active at night and eat mostly insects			0
‘ the females lay two eggs at a time – as an adult these animals will be between four and six inches in length			0
right now he 's about the same size as a pencil eraser			0
‘ we 're often hard pressed to find them in their enclosure – sometimes you 're looking right at them and do n't even know it			1
’ the @entity10 gecko will voluntarily lose its tail if threatened by a predator			0

first described in 1888 and gets name from its point raised ' brow ridges '
born at @entity32 last month but is too small to be seen by the public
so tiny that even zoo staff sometimes can not find it in its enclosure
