by @entity0 obese people who are told obesity is a disease are less likely to try dieting , new research shows describing obesity as a disease makes people eat more , new research suggests			1
the label also encourages unhealthy behaviour among people who are severely overweight , the study revealed			2
the researchers believe this could be because labelling obesity as a disease makes people think it is unchangeable and that attempts at weight loss are likely to be fruitless			1
researchers at the @entity17 and the @entity18 say obese people who are told their condition is a disease place less importance on dieting and are less concerned about their weight			1
as a result , they also tend to eat more unhealthily			0
the @entity25 defined obesity as a disease in june 2013 and psychologists @entity28 and @entity30 wanted to establish what effect this has had			1
‘ considering that obesity is a crucial public health issue , a more nuanced understanding of the impact of an “ obesity is a disease ” message has significant implications for patient - level and policy - level outcomes , ’ said dr @entity35			1
‘ experts have been debating the merits of , and problems with , the @entity25 policy — we wanted to contribute to the conversation by bringing data rather than speculation and by focusing on the psychological repercussions			2
’ dr @entity35 and her colleagues recruited more than 700 participants to take part in an online survey across three different studies			0
the participants read an article related to health and weight and then answered various questions			0
importantly , some participants read an article that described obesity as a disease , some read a standard public health message about weight , and others read an article specifically stating that obesity is not a disease			2
height and weight data were used to calculate the participants ’ body mass index and to classify participants as ‘ average weight ’ or ‘ obese ’ , in line with @entity79 guidelines			0
the results showed that the particular message obese participants read had a clear impact on their attitudes toward health , diet , and weight			0
being told obesity is a disease can make people think their situation is unchangeable specifically , obese participants who read the ‘ obesity is a disease ’ article placed less importance on dieting and reported less concern about weight relative to obese participants who read the other two articles			1
they also chose higher - calorie options when asked to pick a sandwich from a menu			0
interestingly , these participants reported greater body satisfaction , which , in turn , also predicted higher - calorie food choices			0
‘ together , these findings suggest that the messages individuals hear about the nature of obesity have self - regulatory consequences , ’ said dr @entity35			0
despite these findings , the researchers also accept that labelling obesity as a disease can have benefits			1
they say it can reduce stigma which might help obese people engage with , and attempt to tackle , the problem .			2

in june 2013 @entity25 defined obesity as a disease
new research shows this makes people place less importance on dieting
the researchers say it makes people think their situation is unchangeable
but , they say it could be helpful if it reduces the stigma around obesity
