by @entity0 published : 17:30 est , 9 january 2014 updated : 03:05 est , 10 january 2014 @entity2 was left ruing the one that got away after @entity5 all but booked @entity7 ’s place in the @entity9 final with a stunning hat - trick against @entity11			1
while @entity12 ’ misfiring @entity14 side stumbled to a 2 - 1 semi-final first - leg defeat at @entity16 , @entity5 made @entity7 ’s return meeting with @entity11 a formality with his second hat - trick of the season - and 15th goal in 15 home appearances this season - in a 6 - 0 win			1
yet the prolific @entity24 striker could have been wearing the blue of @entity26 , rather than @entity7 , after former @entity27 boss @entity2 despatched his transfer negotiators to @entity29 last january , with orders to bring him back to @entity31			1
@entity2 also headed to @entity45 , to replace sir @entity46 as manager , and was dismayed to discover @entity14 ’s scouting network in southern @entity24 had allowed their city counterparts to outmanoeuvre them for both @entity5 and lightning - quick winger @entity51			1
@entity5 revealed he was aware of @entity26 ’s interest but insisted it was always his intention to see out the season with @entity55 before testing himself in the @entity56			1
slide show : the @entity58 stretches to score his second in the hammering of @entity11 at the @entity61 home comforts : @entity5 now has 15 goals in his last 15 appearances at the @entity61 @entity65 : @entity66 : @entity67 : @entity68 : @entity69 : 10 @entity70 : 10 @entity71 : 10 @entity72 : 5 ‘ there were some rumours , but i just wanted to finish the season with @entity55 , ’ he said			1
‘ i wanted to wait until it got to the summer before i started looking at other options			2
i never really considered the possibility of moving in january			0
’ known affectionately as @entity79 by @entity61 fans , he has terrorised opposition defences all season and is now just one goal behind @entity84 in @entity7 ’s scoring charts			2
‘ i am in a great moment , but i hope to get even better , ’ he said			0
‘ i need to get more goals and catch @entity84 up quickly , because i know that when he comes back from injury , he will score plenty			0
class act : @entity91 was impressed with what he saw from his front man on wednesday @entity95 steps : @entity5 chose to stay with @entity55 last january , rather than head to @entity26 ‘ but , the way i am feeling and the way my game is going , i do feel this could be my best moment so far			2
this could be the best season of my career			0
i ’m feeling comfortable , i score a lot of goals and hopefully i can make some assists			0
this is how i want to continue for the rest of my time here			0
the only real target , though , is to grow , to improve as a player and become better as i go along			0
’ @entity14 have their work cut out to make it an all - @entity45 final , with their tie balanced on a knife - edge , but @entity5 is unconcerned about who @entity7 will face			1
‘ at the moment , we just want to be sure of booking our place , ’ he said			0
‘ maybe the fans are all thinking about @entity14 , but as long as we are in it , i do n’t mind			2
i ’ve never been to @entity120 before , so that is all that matters			0
’ uphill task : @entity14 will go into the second leg of their @entity9 semi-final 2 - 1 down after a shambolic display at @entity16 on tuesday , for whom @entity127 ( right ) scored the winner			1

@entity26 were only prepared to *pay* £ 12m for @entity5 so he stayed in @entity24
striker wanted to see out season with @entity135 club then move to @entity136
*hot* s*hot* hit hat - trick in 6 - 0 @entity9 semi-final win over @entity11
he now has 15 goals in 15 home games this season
@entity2 *'s* @entity14 lost their semi-final first leg 2 - 1 at @entity16
