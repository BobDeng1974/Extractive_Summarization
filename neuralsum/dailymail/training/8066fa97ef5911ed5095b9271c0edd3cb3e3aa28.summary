ms @entity31 's elegant appearances in national media are seen as a sign that @entity5 is trying to raise the country 's aspirations			2
the country of 24 million has suffered severe food shortages since a famine in the mid- 1990s killed hundreds of thousands , but the state 's totalitarian rulers have copious personal wealth and are said to live a lavish lifestyle			2
it is unclear whether the bag is genuine or an imitation , but @entity43 's @entity64 newspaper said it would cost 1.8 million won ( £ 1,017 ) in the capital , @entity66			1
