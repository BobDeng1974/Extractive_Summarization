most homeowners hit by flooding are faced with just two options - clean up and hope it does n't happen again , or move out			2
but one determined couple whose island home was wrecked when the @entity7 burst its banks last year have come up with a new idea - shifting their five - bedroom house 5ft into the air			1
@entity12 and his wife @entity13 have spent almost £ 80,000 jacking their riverside property in @entity16 , @entity17 , up onto stilts , and filling in the gap with breeze blocks			1
@entity12 and his wife @entity13 ( pictured together ) spent almost £ 80,000 jacking their thameside property in @entity16 , @entity17 , up by five feet to prevent it from a repeat of last year 's winter flooding			1
here the house is seen in its finished state , having been put on stilts and the new basement underneath the property bricked up over the course of ten days , a team of engineers lifted the 80 - ton building up into the air , using a steel cradle and 28 computerised jacks which pushed the house upwards at a rate of three inches an hour			2
now , a year after the house was devastated by floods last january , work is complete with the house protected from the waters of the @entity7 , and the @entity12 family enjoying a new basement underneath their home , as well as a new kitchen , replacing the one which was left underwater when the river breached its banks			1
' it 's fantastic , ' mr @entity12 , 59 , told @entity51			1
we are back in the house now and the work is almost all done			2
' there is still some work inside but it 's nearly there			0
' we have created a new basement under the house in the space where the stilts are and that will be useful for storage and we have a new kitchen			2
' it is better than we could have ever imagined , with under floor heating , and a better view out over the river			0
mr @entity12 hired specialist builders who created a network of steel beams under the house which would hold its weight as the property began to lift			1
holes were bored into the brick walls , shown here , so supportive beams could put up both inside and outside the building 28 super-strong jacks — each capable of supporting 50 tons — were placed underneath the steel cradle			0
a diamond - edged saw then sliced horizontally through all the brick walls below the level of the concrete floors , severing the building from its foundations ' every day i look out of the window and i smile and feel happy because i am safe			0
' mr @entity12 , a former engineer and owner of telecommunications business @entity92 , his wife , 49 , their 17 - year - old daughter @entity94 , and dog @entity96 live on an island between the @entity7 and an artificial water channel , which left them vulnerable to flooding			1
when water poured into their home last january it caused £ 125,000 in damage , with the house 's hardwood floor , ground floor walls and electrics wrecked beyond repair			1
as the rain poured down , mr @entity12 's garden was left underwater and even though he tried to set up barricades at his garage and front door , he was unable to stop the water gushing in , leaving the ground floor under nearly half a foot			1
' we are sitting on an island , so when the water comes up it comes from all sides , ' he said			0
' when we were flooded we were an island surrounded 360 degrees by water			0
' the self - employed couple lost a year of business because they could no longer work from their home			2
mrs @entity131 , who runs a jewellery distribution company , said : ' i was hoping right up until the last minute we would not have to move			0
' we thought maybe we could stay and live upstairs , but after a day we realised it was not realistic , when the smell starts			0
the windows and walls of the home were braced with timber beams to help ease any internal strains , and work began to lift the house slowly into the air - with the family 's belongings still inside			1
work to lift the house began after planning permission was granted last june with the perimeter ring of steel steadying the structure and pressure spread evenly over the hydraulic jacks ( pictured ) , no one part of the building was exposed to particular stress as it was lifted from the ground at a rate of three inches an hour ' the house became all humid and stinking - it was not healthy			2
' the value of the house - which had been worth £ 1 million - dropped to £ 750,000 as it could not be insured against future floods			1
now , after the £ 80,000 project the house is thought to be worth between £ 1.5 million and £ 2 million			1
' my view was that if i did nothing it would end up costing me and i would lose a lot of value on the house because i could not insure it , ' he said			0
' but if i did something , if i put in £ 80,000 to save the house , i would definitely get it back if i did decide to sell it			1
' plus i could insure the house and i could live in it safely			0
' father - of - three mr @entity12 had considered sealing the house with a barrier , waterproof doors and pumps to get rid of any ground water or leakage , but worried that just one tiny crack would mean water pouring into his home again			1
' i could have spent £ 35,000 and i would n't know if it would even work , ' he said			2
he also considered demolishing the house completely			0

now , after the £ 80,000 project the house is thought to be worth between £ 1.5 million and £ 2 million			1
it took ten days to lift the house to its agreed height ' it would have cost me maybe £ 400,000 to rebuild it , and i would need to find somewhere else to live , ' he said			2
' so i took up the challenge of lifting it and researching on the internet i saw that it had been done with a concert hall in @entity205			0
' people were sceptical and wanted to see if it would work , but i knew that if it was done properly it then the risk would be almost nothing			0
' after getting permission from the local council , mr @entity12 hired specialist builders who created a network of steel beams under the house which would hold its weight as the property began to lift			1

finally , all the windows and walls were braced with timber beams to help ease any internal strains , and work began to lift the house slowly into the air with the family 's belongings still inside , although they moved out into a rented flat nearby			2
the newly - formed gap at the bottom of the house was then filled with breeze blocks , and the steel cradle removed before the breeze block basement was concealed with reclaimed @entity256 yellow bricks , designed to match the rest of the house			0
mr @entity12 's newly - raised front door now has a long staircase leading up to it , protecting the entrance to the house from any flood water around the back of the family 's house , two former patio doors will soon become a raised decking area for barbecues			1
the family were able to move back into their home in october the couple say the transformation is ' unbelievable ' , and their higher home means they enjoy a better view of the river his front door now has a long staircase leading up to it and around the back of his house two former patio doors , which are now suspended from mid air , will soon become a raised decking area for barbecues			1
work on the main structure was completed in august , and the family were able to move back in last october			0
mr @entity12 's home , which the family have lived in since 1998 , is thought to be the first in @entity295 to have been lifted in this way , and he has been visited by officers from the @entity298 eager to learn from his project			1
his neighbours , many of whom were forced to leave their homes in last january 's floods , have also turned to him for advice on how to protect their own homes from any future damage			2
' 2014 was total chaos , ' said mr @entity12			2
' i could not work , by wife could not work and we were out of our home			0
' now 2014 is behind us and we are looking forward to the future			0
' we are so happy that we have done it and the house is unbelievable			0
