among the millions of war heroes who will be commemorated in @entity1 on tuesday november 11 is one of the greatest boxers who ever lived			1
@entity4 – as he was born in @entity5 , @entity6 100 years and six months ago – was not killed in action			1
indeed , he did not see combat during @entity9 despite being a private in the army			1
@entity4 at @entity12 in 1942 just after enlisting in the @entity13 ( left ) and in @entity14 in 1944 born : may 13 , 1914			1
died : april 12 , 1981 weight : heavyweight record fights : 70 wins : 66			2
wins by ko : 52 losses : 3 no contest : 1 he was world heavyweight champion from 1937 to 1949 they do things a little differently over there			0
this is not @entity29 in the @entity1			1
@entity30 , the last monday in may , is when they pay specific tribute to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice			0
november 11 is @entity35 , when they honour all past members of the military			0
and @entity4 did his bit for country even though he never fired a bullet in anger			1
not that the @entity4 , as he was also known , was unwilling to go to the front			1
exactly one month after @entity1 declared war on @entity46 , following the attack on @entity48 , the heavyweight champion of the world walked into an army camp near @entity52 to voluntarily enlist as a private			1
when told by the clerk to state his occupation , @entity4 responded : ‘ fighting … them @entity56			1
’ a trickier question came from fellow african - americans who asked why he was joining the then - racially segregated @entity1 army			2
again he had the answer : ‘ lots of things wrong with @entity1 - but @entity67 ain ‘ t gon na fix ‘ em. ’ louis shakes the hand of a taxi driver during his trip to @entity14 in 1944 shrewdly , the authorities perceived that for all his physical courage his greater value would be recruiting more black soldiers , who made an important contribution and suffered numerous casualties			1
among those who followed him into uniform was @entity81 , the young baseball slugger whose subsequent signing by the @entity83 broke that sport ’s six - decade colour barrier			0
the impact of @entity4 on race relations in the @entity1 was even more profound			1
the @entity13 recruitment poster in @entity9 the remark about @entity67 made him a driving force for @entity92 sentiment across all sections of society there and strengthened support for the decision to enter the war			1
then a widely distributed recruitment poster ( right ) helped him become @entity1 ’s first non-white national hero			1
it showed ‘ pvt. @entity4 ’ saying : ‘ we ’re going to do our part ... and we ’ll win because we ’re on @entity104 ’s side			2
’ in company with another ring legend , @entity106 , @entity4 travelled to @entity107 and the @entity108 , raising troop morale in the course of 96 exhibition fights watched by a combined two million soldiers			1
@entity1 ’s latent resentment of a black man holding the supreme world title - and not only that being acclaimed as the greatest heavyweight champion of his and all previous eras – evaporated			1
he became a sought - after celebrity			0
the tax - man was not so forgiving			0
@entity4 received not one dime of the 90,000 dollars he generated for the war effort with a series of fund - raising bouts			2
nevertheless the @entity125 added that amount to his income … … and to the $ 500,000 tax assessment already demanded despite his handlers milking all but an estimated $ 800,000 from his purses totalling more than $ 6 million			0
such can be the spoils of war			0
@entity4 returned to the prize - ring in 1946 , having to fight for the money as well as the glory , and was fiscally obliged to make a come - back after one retirement			2
the end came with an eighth round ko by @entity141 – only his third loss in 70 fights – at the conclusion of a severe beating in @entity146			0
he was to admit that the financial stress drove him to drugs and his last years were difficult			0
but @entity1 did not forget			2
certainly not one @entity1 president			2
@entity4 ( left ) hands out a severe beating to a bloodied @entity151 at @entity152 in @entity52 in 1940 when @entity4 died in 1981 , aged just 66 , @entity153 decreed he should be buried at the @entity154 , with full military honours			2
on november 11 in @entity157 and the @entity158 , we bow our heads in respect for the fallen			0
we know , also , that service takes many forms			0
at a time when it became fashionable to say that the @entity4 was a credit to his race , renowned @entity165 sports reporter @entity164 wrote thus : ‘ yes , @entity4 is a credit to his race … the human race			2
’ had he been born this side of the @entity175 , he would have worn his poppy with pride			0
there could be life in ' @entity180 yet despite his @entity181 there is a clamour for @entity184 to retire following saturday night ’s loss of his world light - heavyweight title to @entity188 , just two months short of his 50th birthday			1
after all , he was knocked down in the first and lost the ensuing 11 rounds as well to end up on the wrong end of a whitewash decision in @entity194			0
yet there may be life in the old pug yet			0
@entity184 ( left ) gets hit by @entity188 of @entity198 during the third round of @entity201 's defeat the @entity202 – as he calls himself in reference to his phenomenal athletic condition for a human of his age – went the distance with the @entity198 who knocks out almost everyone he fights and is therefore dubbed ‘ @entity210			1
’ @entity211 - the decades younger @entity212 who is among those who have been ‘ krushed ’ - returns to the ring to face @entity217 rival @entity216 in @entity218 on saturday week			0
@entity184 gave a more distinguished account of himself and could call it quits with great distinction , as the oldest world champion ever			1
so it his decision , alone , if he chooses make further history as a title challenger at 50			0
cleverly v @entity216 will be live on @entity227			0
can the @entity202 can achieve another first ? that of fighting on extra-terrestrial television .			0

@entity4 never saw conflict but was an @entity1 @entity13 hero
he was *instrumental* in the recruitment of black soldiers
his image and words *adorned* a recruitment poster during the @entity9
@entity4 was a driving force for @entity92 sentiment across @entity1
@entity184 might not call it quits despite defeat by @entity188
