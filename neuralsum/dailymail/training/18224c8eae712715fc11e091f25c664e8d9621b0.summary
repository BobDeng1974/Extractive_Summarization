@entity0 has called on the @entity1 to consider temporary substitutions in a bid to improve concussion treatment			2
the @entity6 boss was left frustrated after medics withdrew @entity8 just 11 minutes into saturday 's 2 - 1 defeat at @entity10 , only for the @entity12 midfielder to be deemed ' fine ' at half - time			1
@entity8 suffered a heavy blow to the head and manager @entity0 admitted doctors must take no chances with such complex injuries			2
@entity19 midfielder @entity8 is forced off with a head injury during the first half of @entity6 's game at @entity10 club doctors now have the final say over whether players who suffer head injuries are withdrawn , after widespread criticism last season when @entity30 ' @entity29 returned to action despite being knocked unconscious			1
the @entity33 boss suggested football take a leaf out of rugby 's book and implement short - term replacements , to allow extended assessment of head injuries			2
' you could n't wait 10 or 15 minutes with 10 men , you just could n't do it , ' said @entity0			2
' so you could n't give medics that amount of time to look at a player			0
' but it does n't sound the worst idea for a temporary replacement , so that the doctors could have a longer look at the player with the potential head injury			0
@entity0 talks to his summer signing as the midfielder was withdrawn after only 11 minutes at @entity57 's ' that is something worth looking at			1
medical people have got to be so careful , they ca n't take a chance because if anything went wrong there would be massive trouble			0
' if someone is very bad you can not expect them to carry on because if something went wrong we would all be very sorry			0
' at half - time there did n't seem to be a lot wrong with @entity8 to me though			1
' he was fine in the changing rooms , he did n't look too bad at all but obviously the doctors have got to err on the side of caution			0
' @entity79 expresses his delight towards the travelling @entity6 supporters after scoring on saturday @entity83 's scissor - kick volley trumped a fine blast on the spin from @entity79 to deny @entity6 any points on the south coast			1
former @entity10 boss @entity0 admitted @entity6 are continuing to count the cost of losing @entity89 to @entity90 in the final stages of the transfer window			1
@entity0 believes @entity6 are missing ' 16 goals ' after being unable to secure a replacement for @entity95 striker @entity89 , with a deal for @entity97 falling through			1
' i thought @entity99 ( @entity100 ) was excellent when he came on , held up the ball well , but we are short and we do n't have an awful lot of striking options , ' said @entity0			1
@entity83 makes the perfect connection from a cross to score in spectacular fashion as @entity10 won 2 - 1 ' we have lost 16 goals when @entity89 went			1
it is a problem : you look at last year and @entity79 ( @entity110 ) got 17 goals and no one else got anywhere near			0
' @entity0 admitted he was disappointed @entity115 's case of mistaken identity with the police ended up making headlines			2
@entity6 defender @entity115 was wrongly detained by police in @entity120 after being falsely accused of stealing soft cheese from a @entity123 store			2
@entity0 said the incident has had no effect on club or player			0
' it is not fair to get accused of that			0
i honestly do n't know the story of it all , but surely he does n't need to nick a piece of cheese			0
' if he had stolen it then he would deserve to be in trouble for being such an idiot but obviously he has n't			0
' how does it get in the papers ; how does it get in ? we have all been there have n't we , someone tells them			0
' @entity0 is concerned by the lack of striking options at his disposal at @entity6 this season after losing @entity89			1
