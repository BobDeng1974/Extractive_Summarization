by @entity0 tourists in @entity2 could not believe their eyes when @entity5 - a 20ft giraffe - casually strolled through an animal sanctuary restaurant			1
it was a shock to visitors at the @entity9 animal sanctuary in @entity10 who after an initial shock then became hysterical with nervous laughter			1
the giraffe stopped briefly and sniffed in the bins but had obviously already had its dinner as it did not stop for a bite to eat or drink			2
fortunately though one smart visitor decided to video the whole incident - proving to friends and family back home that the story was no lie			0
' how can you explain this to someone , ' a woman is heard asking a fellow onlooker on the video			0
she added : ' it 's not the same as saying , " oh the giraffe was in the restaurant			0
' the @entity54 allows animals access to all areas and zebras are also often spotted around the grounds			0
unimpressed : @entity5 walks off into the night looking distinctly unimpressed with the menu at the animal park strolling : this is the moment @entity5 casually walks across the bar at the @entity9 animal sanctuary in @entity10 - causing gasps from tourists sitting nearby tower of strength : @entity5 's true size and strength can be seen from this angle - an enormous animal disappearing into the night : the giraffe heads home after her short trip to the bar - no doubt she 'll back again			1
