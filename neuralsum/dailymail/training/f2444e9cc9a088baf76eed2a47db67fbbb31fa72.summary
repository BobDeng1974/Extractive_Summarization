@entity25 solicitors @entity26 said they are working on behalf of the women who want to take legal action against the council because of the abuse they suffered			2
today in a stunning development @entity20 confirmed that deputy leader of council and vice chair of the police and crime panel councillor @entity38 has stepped down over allegations that he knew about the relationship			1
the @entity41 alleges that at the time mr @entity38 , who is related to @entity10 , not only knew about his relationship with a child but also that he set up a ' deal under which a violent offender ( @entity10 ) agreed to hand a missing child to police after being assured that he would not be detained '			1
but mr @entity38 , who was a taxi driver at the time , told @entity49 shortly before he stepped down today that the allegations are ' total lies ' and also denied that there had been any such deal			1
a spokesman confirmed that the council had referred the matter to the police ' to consider if any criminal offence has been committed and to undertake any appropriate criminal investigation			2

the @entity41 revealed today that @entity10 has never been prosecuted for suspected child sex offences , and is only now being investigated 14 years on			1
at the time he was on a social services list of men believed to be grooming up to 40 young girls in the area and more than a dozen believed he was their ' boyfriend '			1
it has been alleged that @entity20 ( pictured ) said they had ' no power ' to intervene despite an admission the man and girl were having sex @entity2 described how she met @entity10 days after her 14th birthday in 1999 , and after he bought her chicken and chips he took her to some woods and told her : ' you 're not really 16 are you ? you look too young '			1
they starting seeing each other regularly and her parents could not keep them apart - in the end she was taken into ' emergency ' care			2
but @entity2 was rarely in school so the relationship continued , and @entity10 would even follow her on holiday , on one occasion renting a caravan in @entity107 so they could have sex there			1
in june 2000 police and social services reports said that @entity10 and the girl , now 15 , were ' known to be having a sexual relationship ' and she was ' at risk of sexual abuse '			1
but after he was sent to prison for violent disorder and intimidation in a different case , @entity2 got an injunction against him			2
describing the infatuation @entity2 said : ' it was like somebody put a spell on me			2
i wanted to marry him			0
he did n't tell me he was already married			0
' i did n't think of myself as being groomed , but now i realise it was an abusive relationship			0
it can stay with you for the rest of your life			0
' police and social services do n't want to take any responsibility for what happened back then '			0
speaking about when she was caught in bed with him by police , @entity2 , which is not her real name , told @entity41 : ' i was in bed upstairs with @entity142 when the police came into the house			1
he panicked and pulled on some trousers			0
' i grabbed a pair of knickers and tried to hide under the bed			0
one of the police officers told me to come out			0
he could see my legs sticking out			0
' ; officers then found an offensive weapon and she was arrested , but despite noting later she was ' at risk of sexual abuse ' @entity10 was released			1
a @entity158 funded review , examining her case , quoted by @entity41 confirmed that @entity10 , with permission of the authorities , was allowed to call her mobile phone and even to collect her from her foster carer 's home			1
resigned : @entity166 , deputy leader of @entity20 council , denies that he knew anything about his relative 's sexual relationship with a 14 - year - old but has stepped down today it said : ' @entity173 was allowed to contact ( @entity2 ) via mobile telephone , was allowed to arrange to collect her from foster carer 's home by ringing in advance and asking to meet him at the end of street ' with the ' knowledge and consent ' of social services			1
it also said there was an ' unwillingness to recognise danger of relationship ' an ' in the absence of any criminal prosecution of perpetrator as a pimp , all rumours about him were speculation and there was no cause for concern			0
' staff ' also took some comfort in knowing where ( @entity2 ) was ' , it said , and @entity10 was even allowed to attend appointments with her gp			1
solicitor @entity203 told @entity49 this afternoon that his client @entity10 is unwell and unable to comment today			1
a spokesman for @entity20 said following @entity207 , the authority asked @entity208 ( @entity208 ) to thoroughly review all historical cases that may be linked to child sexual exploitation			0
he added : ' that review is ongoing and continues with a number of live and ongoing investigations			0
' @entity214 wishes to support @entity208 and not potentially compromise this process			0
as such we will not be making further comments on the article without further consultation with our police colleagues			0
' in response to the claims , @entity208 and crime commissioner @entity223 said he was deeply concerned			0
mr @entity223 said : ' the allegations made in today 's @entity41 newspaper about the way in which various agencies failed to adequately combat child sexual exploitation and protect vulnerable victims 14 years ago concerns me deeply			1
' the approach taken today is vastly improved , and as commissioner , my determination is to ensure that the approach that is now being taken by those agencies in responding to and investigating allegations of such crimes is consummately professional			2
' i will be seeking assurances from the chief constable and other agencies that all allegations of such crimes are thoroughly investigated , that victims are fully supported and that this process is underpinned by the most robust and thorough processes and policies			0
' the commissioner said extra resources had been provided to @entity208 to help combat child sexual exploitation and he noted that @entity248 is about to review the approach to the problem being taken by all police forces			0
the authorities in @entity20 , @entity25 , have been accused of turning a blind eye to sex grooming gangs for more than a decade , confidential files have revealed in 2010 five men , described by a judge as ' sexual predators ' , were given lengthy jail terms after they were found guilty of grooming teenage girls for sex			1
the prosecution was the first of a series of high - profile cases in the last three years that have revealed the exploitation of young girls in towns including @entity270 , @entity271 and @entity272			2
last year it emerged police in the town turned a blind eye to allegations of sexual abuse of white girls by gangs of largely @entity282 men for more than a decade			1
research , reports and case files also revealed that council officials were desperate to cover up any racial link to the abuse of young girls			2
following the 2010 case , the @entity41 claimed details from 200 restricted - access documents showed how police and child protection agencies in the @entity25 town had extensive knowledge of these activities for a decade , yet a string of offences went unprosecuted			1
the allegations led to a range of official investigations , including a probe by the @entity303			0
@entity208 said today it ' deeply regrets ' the publication of the @entity41 story ' about an on - going , complex and highly sensitive investigation into matters of historic child sexual exploitation			2
' but the @entity41 defended its decision to publish saying it believed stories like this ' will encourage others to come forward to tell police what happened to them so that successful prosecutions of their abusers will be more rather than less likely			2
' it said : ' the police have asked us not to publish ( the story ) at this time for fear of prejudicing their own inquiries			0
' while we recognise the significant advances that have recently been made in the force 's approach to tackling child sexual exploitation , we do not believe that enough has yet been done			0
' @entity208 has had more than a dozen years to investigate the crimes against ( the girl )			0
' it is almost a year since this newspaper first highlighted the abuse inflicted upon other vulnerable girls in @entity20 by groups of offenders who were allowed to act with virtual impunity			2
" @entity338 , of @entity339 , said : " it is important to remember that at the time of the abuse they were children under the age of 16 and could not legally consent			0
" referring to the @entity303 report , mr @entity338 said : ' the report noted part of the problem is that adults may misunderstand the grooming process and assume that the young person was a willing participant in a relationship , rather than the victim of sexual abuse			0
