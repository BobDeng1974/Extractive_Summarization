former troops said their reputations had been tarnished and their relatives had suffered years of anguish due to the allegations , which the £ 31million investigation eventually exposed as ‘ calculated lies ’			1
last night the mother of one of the soldiers who gave evidence to the taxpayer - funded inquiry said the way her son had been accused of wrongdoing was ‘ disgraceful ’			1
she said @entity26 , now 31 , heroically fought off the enemy – only to have his name dragged through the mud			2
@entity30 , 50 , from @entity31 , @entity32 , told the @entity33 : ‘ i think the inquiry disturbed him and this coming back again now has just upset and disturbed him again			2

’ she said her son was just 21 when he engaged in a ferocious firefight named @entity42 in 2004			0
the convoy he was travelling with came under fire from militants armed with grenades and @entity47			0
‘ it was a worrying time for the family as he was so young and fighting over there , ’ she said			0
‘ now this has opened it all up again for both @entity26 and the family			0

the long - running inquiry found that @entity3 troops mistreated nine @entity11 detainees following a fierce battle a decade ago , but false allegations of murder and torture were the product of ' deliberate lies ' the @entity6 public inquiry released shocking images which formed part of its investigation into the ferocious firefight , dubbed the @entity113 , at a checkpoint near @entity115 in 2004 when a number of insurgents were killed but on the way there in armoured warrior vehicles , his unit was ambushed by insurgents from three positions			1

but their heroic efforts were tarnished when the detainees claimed they were subjected to torture and witnessed executions and mutilation			0
the @entity142 probe into the shocking allegations found they were ‘ wholly and entirely without merit ’			1
it exonerated @entity3 troops , saying the @entity11 men they were accused of torturing were not innocent farmers but insurgents killed or captured in the firefight			1
@entity3 troops had responded to the ‘ deadly ambush with exemplary courage , resolution and professionalism ’ , according to sir @entity156 , who was conducting the inquiry			1

his firm , @entity160 , has received around £ 3million in public money for the @entity97 alone and has been involved in dozens of other such claims			0
it is still representing another 1,500 @entity11 who say they are the victims of @entity3 abuse			1
@entity188 - based mr @entity164 has also persuaded prosecutors at the @entity190 to probe @entity3 over claims of war crimes by troops			1
