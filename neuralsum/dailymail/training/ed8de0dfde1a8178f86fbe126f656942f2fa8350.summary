@entity0 , one fifth of the world 's biggest boyband @entity2 , was at the @entity4 on tuesday night to cheer on @entity5			1
despite growing up in @entity6 , he supports the club because of his dad , who pledged allegiance when @entity10 ruled the roost			0
@entity0 has attended matches in the past – including the 2007 @entity14 play - off final – and was in a box here after performing on sunday 's x factor final in @entity19 , alongside @entity21 guitarist @entity20 , wearing a @entity23 earpiece			2
one direction star @entity0 ( right ) left his band - mates to watch @entity5 take on @entity26 on tuesday @entity27 had an interest in the match through @entity30 , who is on loan at @entity5 from the @entity33 giants			1
he gave mascarell his first - team debut in his last match at the @entity38 in june 2013 , replacing @entity39 with nine minutes left of a 4 - 2 win over @entity41			2
@entity27 loanee @entity30 ( left ) challenges @entity26 's @entity42 on tuesday evening @entity34 went mad at the people carrying the stretcher onto the pitch as @entity46 lay stricken on the floor , physically pushing two of the quartet to hurry up			1
@entity42 and @entity50 then ran over to drag them along quicker			0
it was odd to see such medical staff walking but the doctors were already tending to @entity46 and did not look in immediate need of the stretcher			0
@entity34 has history of agitation in similar circumstances , of course , attacking the @entity61 for the time taken to arrive at @entity64 's @entity63 to collect @entity65 in 2006			2
his claims were later rebuked			0
@entity26 duo @entity50 ( left ) and @entity42 help carry on the stretcher for @entity46 @entity68 was culpable for @entity26 's opening goal , just as his error led to @entity71 scoring @entity73 's winner in may 's @entity14 play - off final			1
his slip here allowed @entity42 to pick up his 15th assist of the season , 10 more than any other @entity26 player			0
away fans cruelly taunted @entity68 , chanting ' are you @entity81 in disguise ? ' he did make amends of sorts with two excellent challenges on @entity86 in dangerous positions			0
@entity68 was at fault as @entity90 forward @entity89 opened the scoring for @entity26			1

@entity0 has followed in his dad 's *footsteps* by supporting @entity5
he was at the @entity4 to watch their *defeat* by @entity26 on tuesday
@entity34 gave @entity5 's @entity30 his debut at @entity27
the @entity26 boss was *unhappy* with the speed of the stretcher *carriers*
@entity68 was at fault for @entity89 's opening goal
