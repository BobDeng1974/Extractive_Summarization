by @entity0 published : 18:36 est , 2 july 2013 updated : 01:43 est , 3 july 2013 the controversial @entity3 peer in charge of the @entity6 ’s new diplomatic service was facing fresh charges of waste last night after figures revealed that she employs nearly 500 chauffeurs – including one paid £ 62,000 a year			1
@entity12 , who has faced repeated charges of profligacy since being plucked from obscurity to be the @entity6 ’s first ‘ foreign minister ’ , paid one chauffeur a basic salary of almost £ 5,200 a month – equal to an annual salary of more than £ 62,000 a year			1
the @entity6 ’s diplomatic service now employs almost 500 drivers to ferry officials between meetings , with many of them on lavish salaries , figures released to the @entity28 show			1
@entity12 who is paid a salary of more than £ 250,000 as well as lavish expenses , is the highest paid female politician in the world the most expensive vehicle bought for the diplomatic service cost £ 182,695			1
the figures also show that chauffeurs clocked up 30,000 miles last year with no - one in the back of the car			2
@entity12 , who is paid a salary of more than £ 250,000 as well as lavish expenses , is the highest paid female politician in the world			1
her income is similar to that of @entity43 president @entity42			0
she also enjoys the use of a bulletproof car with two chauffeurs , and a lavish grace - and - favour home in @entity48			1
the total budget of her @entity50 ( @entity50 ) went up by 5.7 per cent last year to £ 442million , with @entity52 ’s share of the bill increasing to about £ 58million			0
@entity55 mep @entity54 said the figures made a mockery of @entity12 ’s claim that she was running a lean operation			0
she added : ‘ the @entity50 was meant to be budget neutral , yet this year @entity12 has asked for £ 20million more to run her expensive , inefficient and unproductive diplomatic service			1
‘ last month @entity62 announced that the @entity52 ’s @entity63 would need to make savings of 6 per cent			0
the @entity6 and @entity12 should be expected to do the same			2
‘ these figures show the service now has four drivers per @entity6 embassy – that is completely unwarranted			2
salaries of over £ 60,000 are unreasonable and an army of chauffeurs driving empty cars and spitting out tonnes of carbon dioxide makes a sham of the @entity6 ’s commitment to reduce climate change			2
’ the revelations are embarrassing for @entity12 , who has faced diplomatic grumblings that she is too low - profile to make an impact on the world stage			1
she was appointed as part of an extraordinary stitch - up in 2009 , which saw equally obscure @entity87 @entity86 appointed as the @entity6 ’s first president , after @entity6 leaders rejected more high - profile figures who might steal their thunder			2
the two jobs were both created by the @entity94			0
critics claim say both are a waste of money			0
@entity12 has faced diplomatic grumblings that she is too low - profile to make an impact on the world stage the new figures reveal that the @entity50 has 484 drivers operating out of 141 @entity6 ‘ embassies ’ around the world as well as @entity48			1
the highest - paid driver works in @entity106			0
@entity12 said the @entity50 had had to buy several bulletproof cars for use in danger zones , which accounted for the decision to spend £ 182,000 on a single vehicle			1
she said the highest sum spent on a non-armoured vehicle was £ 42,000			0
a @entity48 source said @entity6 diplomats frequently asked their chauffeurs to travel vast distances to collect them when they travelled by plane			1
the source added : ‘ you get cases where an official in @entity122 will fly to @entity123 and get their driver to travel ahead so they can pick them up and ferry them around			0
it does n’t seem to matter that the chauffeur is driving miles with no - one on board			0
’ a @entity134 spokesman said the £ 62,000 salary was ‘ at the extreme end of the scale ’			0
he said the average salary was closer to £ 10,000 .			0
