dr @entity56 also listed her top tips for a successful haggling experience abroad			1
first impressions : never show that you love an item , always create the impression you quite like it , but you would need to be persuaded to part with cash			0
always wait to be approached before starting your negotiation			2
in fact , it 's a good idea to look as if you are about to walk away when they approach you			0
embrace ' tourist traps ' : on a packed street of restaurants or souvenir shops , you hold all the aces			2
choose a quieter time when they are more desperate for customers , be bold and negotiate up front on what you are prepared to pay			0
brush up your acting skills : this is a game , so be prepared to play			0
wait for an opening price , look shocked and start walking away			0
the stallholder might ask how much you are willing to pay - always answer with half the amount they first priced it at			0
choose your friends : always smile and be pleasant , make friends - but do n't get too friendly or you will start to feel sorry for the stallholder when he tells you his sob story about how little money he is making			0
mix up your tactics : if you 're with a partner or friend , play good cop , bad cop where one enthuses over the item while the other points out its flaws			0
if you 're with a small child , explain they are spending their pocket money and only have a small amount ( if this is true - do n't encourage deceitful behaviour in your kids ! ) 6			0
language barrier : turn any language barrier to your advantage by pretending you do n't understand when they tell you exactly why the item is worth so much more than you want to pay			0
just repeat your offer and look blankly at any attempts they might make at justifying their price .			0
