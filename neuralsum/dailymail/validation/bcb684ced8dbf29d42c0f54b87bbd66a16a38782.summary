three in four households are paying up to £ 250 a year more on gas and electricity than they have to , official figures reveal			1
most families are still on their energy firm 's standard variable tariff – two years after @entity7 promised to force suppliers to put all customers on the best deal			1
the standard packages are £ 180 a year more expensive than the cheapest tariff , with some customers paying nearly £ 250 a year more			1
three in four households are paying up to £ 250 a year more on gas and electricity than they have to , because they are on a standard variable tariff rather than the cheapest deal @entity18 energy secretary @entity17 said mr @entity7 had promised 17 times in the @entity20 to make energy suppliers automatically put all customers on their supplier 's lowest tariff			1
she said : ' more than two years after @entity7 promised to make energy companies put all customers on the lowest tariff , millions of households are still being routinely overcharged by hundreds of pounds every single year			1
' that 's why the next @entity31 government will freeze energy prices until 2017 , so that bills can fall but not rise , give the regulator the power to force energy suppliers to cut their prices and end overcharging once and for all			1
' last month the @entity40 released early findings of an inquiry into the sector that the @entity44 were overcharging millions of loyal customers by up to £ 234 a year			2
during @entity48 's @entity47 's @entity46 , @entity7 pledged to force energy firms to put customers on the cheapest tariff its findings showed 95 % of the @entity55 's 19 million dual fuel customers - those who take gas and electricity from the same company - could have saved between £ 158 and £ 234 by switching tariff or supplier			1
the @entity40 found the @entity44 had consistently charged higher prices for standard variable tariffs than for other deals such as fixed tariffs			2
@entity67 chief executive @entity66 said : ' standard variable tariffs are just that , the standard price a company is offering energy to customers			1
@entity31 's @entity17 said mr @entity7 had promised 17 times to make energy suppliers put all customers on the lowest tariff ' part of the cost of energy is an assurance that the gas and electricity has been bought months in advance , making sure energy will be available to customers when it is needed			1
' new fixed - price deals are able to take advantage of short - term changes in costs and usually offer lower prices than the standard deals , often for a year or two			2
' however , the important thing for customers to remember is there are a wide range of deals available in the market			0
' if a customer thinks they might be able to save some money by switching tariff or company , they should log on to a comparison site or call their supplier			0
' @entity106 chief executive @entity105 said : ' while recent price cuts are a step in the right direction , many customers could be better off to the tune of up to £ 250 by moving from a variable rate to a fixed rate deal			1
' if you 're not sure where to start , then i 'd strongly recommend the @entity117 website for an independent and impartial guide			0
' a @entity120 spokeswoman said : ' our reforms to drive down household bills are working and the best energy tariffs are cheaper than they were a year ago			2
but people want to see more savings - now - and the power is in their hands to do something about it			0
by shopping around for a better deal and switching energy suppliers households can save around £ 200 and some even more			2
' consumers deserve a fair deal - and this is exactly why we 're backing the @entity40 's investigation			0
' despite wholesale energy prices falling sharply , household energy bills are not dropping at the same rate – nor at the same level across providers			0
anyone on a standard tariff with a @entity44 provider – @entity146 , @entity147 , npower , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 – who has not switched for several years can almost certainly save money by jumping ship			0
households should really review deals every year to ensure they are n't overpaying , but even moving every other year will save you significant amounts			0
remember , suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs			0
prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you will depend where you live			0
you can check how prices compare using the tool on the right .			0
