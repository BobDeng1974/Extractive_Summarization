but it was n't for the usual goal scoring reasons as the @entity9 were held to a 0 - 0 draw by a stubborn @entity12 side at the @entity13			1
@entity0 instead was the centre of attention following two incidents which could have led to the dismissal of the @entity19 striker in the @entity20			1
the @entity37 international was n't cautioned for the retaliation , with the incident sparking debate over the similarities between that and a similar reaction shown by @entity44 the previous weekend , which saw the @entity46 midfielder sent off against @entity47			0
