it has been described as a durable and scratch resistant smartwatch and is a considerable investment , costing from $ 349 ( £ 299 )			1
but the @entity5 model has been to shown to shatter easily after being dropped from a height of just under four feet ( 1.2 metres )			2
@entity5 claims its watch , which has an @entity9 glass display , is ' protected by a lightweight aluminosilicate glass that 's especially resistant to scratches and impact			1
the model has an @entity9 glass display which is supposed to be ' resistant to scratches and impact ' in a video , @entity21 drops the 42mm timepiece from a height of four feet ( 1.2 metres ) to simulate what may happen if a wearer drops their watch while tightening or unfastening the strap			1
when @entity30 dropped the watch ‘ not aiming at the display , ’ in a test conducted in @entity37 , @entity38 , it survived unscathed despite a nasty ‘ crack ’ noise when the timepiece hit the pavement			1
however , when the watch was dropped so the display hit the floor first , the screen shattered with beads of glass seen on the ground after impact			1
in the video he exclaims : ' are you serious @entity5 ? that was n’t even that bad			0
that was about three - and - a - half feet ! ' deep impact : when online tester @entity30 dropped the watch ‘ not aiming at the display , ’ in a test conducted in @entity37 , @entity38 , it survived unscathed despite a nasty ‘ crack ’ noise when the timepiece hit the pavement			1
however , when it landed on its face ( pictured ) , it smashed instantly the watch has ' high performance ' rubber straps and the screen is held in an anodised aluminium case , that 's 60 per cent stronger than standard aluminium , but is just as light			2
the @entity5 ( pictured ) has high performance ' rubber straps and the screen is held in an anodised aluminium case the tester added : ‘ i found it amazing that the amount of shatter that occurred was so tremendous			2
' when he threw the watch down with force , the screen came off completely			0
damage to the screen , such as chips , scratches or indeed shattering , is not covered by the watch 's warranty and is expensive to fix , @entity85 reports			1
damage eligible for warranty service includes debris under the screen , a loose back cover and condensation in the heart rate monitor sensor windows			2
@entity85 also discovered that in the @entity98 owners will have to pay repairs fees of $ 229 , $ 329 and $ 2,800 for the @entity101 models respectively to fix a cracked or missing crown , missing buttons , or screen damage , for example			1
it is not known how much these repairs will cost in the @entity107 and other regions and @entity109 has contacted @entity5 for comment			2
by comparison , the @entity111 , which costs from $ 549 ( £ 479 ) and @entity5 watch edition from $ 12,000 ( £ 8,000 ) have different screens made of @entity116 glass			1
in a recent test , repair specialists in @entity118 showed that the 38mm @entity116 screen remained scratch - free after being subjected to being rubbed with sandpaper , keyed and even hit with a hammer			2

@entity127 said : ‘ i found it amazing that the amount of shatter that occurred was so tremendous ' by comparison , the @entity111 , which costs from $ 549 ( £ 479 ) and @entity5 watch edition from $ 12,000 ( £ 8,000 ) , have screens made of @entity116 glass			1
in a recent test conducted by repair specialists in @entity118 , the 38mm @entity116 screen remained scratch - free after being subjected to sandpaper and and hit with a hammer but some early adopters of the @entity111 have complained its stainless steel case scratches easily , according to @entity139			2
the @entity141 steel used is cold - forged to be ' extra hard ' , but it seems to scratch in a similar way to the back of an @entity144			0
but it 's not all doom and gloom for @entity149 owners			0
another test has shown that the @entity5 model does live up to @entity5 's waterproof claims			1
unhappy : some early adopters of the @entity111 have complained that its stainless steel case ( pictured ) scratches easily , much like the back of an @entity144 waterproof : but another test has shown that the @entity5 lives up to @entity5 's waterproof claims after surviving 15 minutes in a swimming pool ( shown above ) @entity5 's ceo , @entity159 previously said that he showers wearing his @entity111 and @entity5 said the sport edition has an @entity163 water - resistance rating , which means it can be submerged up to 3ft ( 1 metre ) underwater for 30 minutes			1
and a team at @entity166 in @entity167 has shown that the watch can not only withstand a long , soapy shower , as well as being submerged in a bucket of water for five minutes , but can also be left in a swimming pool for around 15 minutes , @entity139 reported			1
while the screen could n't be used while in the pool , because of the capacitive screen technology , when it was fished out afterwards it functioned as normal			0
the team found that the @entity177 still worked underwater , allowing them to zoom in and out of apps			0
the sapphire glass screen in the @entity111 has remained scratch - free after being subjected to being rubbed with sandpaper , keyed and even hit with a hammer			1
the test was carried out by @entity118 - based @entity185 repairs specialist @entity184 , which used a sapphire screen from a 38mm @entity5 watch for its experiment			1
two out of the three models of @entity190 have sapphire glass screens - the @entity111 and @entity192			0
the glass is made from synthetic sapphire , which is created by applying heat and pressure to aluminium oxide powder , before the crystals are processed to remove impurities			0
the tiny round disks created are ground into shape , and polished , to become glass			0
@entity116 glass is said to be twice as tough as normal glass and almost as hard as a diamond			0
to test the durability of the screen , it was rubbed against a stone wall and then with a coin , before being ‘ scratched ’ by a key			0
the video capturing the attempts at destruction , shows no scratches were achieved to the screen			0
it also withstood being rubbed with abrasive sandpaper at some force and hit by a hammer – albeit not very hard			0
but most impressive , was the screen ’s ability to withstand an electric drill being dragged across its surface , without leaving a mark			0
the test led @entity227 to claim : ‘ @entity116 glass is pretty strong and virtually impossible to scratch ’ .			0

@entity5 edition costs $ 349 ( £ 299 ) and has an @entity9 glass screen
' durable ' screen shattered when the watch 's face hit the ground first
screen damage is not covered for free repairs in the @entity240 warranty
but another test has shown the *device* lives up to @entity5 's waterproof claims after it survived 15 minutes in a swimming pool
