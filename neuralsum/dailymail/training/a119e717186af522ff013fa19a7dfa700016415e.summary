hungry diners may argue about pizza toppings , but most people agree the cheese on their pizza should look golden , taste great and have just the right amount of elasticity			0
now food scientists have identified the best combination of cheese to ensure an optimal amount of stringiness and flavour			2
and they say that a mixture of mozzarella and cheddar makes for the perfect pizza			1
the secret to grate pizza : food scientists have identified the best combination of cheese to ensure an optimal amount of stringiness and flavour on pizzas			1
they say that mozzarella can be mixed with other cheeses such as cheddar to make ' gourmet pizzas ' scientists at the @entity29 evaluated different cheeses - mozzarella , cheddar , colby , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , and provolone - to see how well they melted			1
they evaluated how the cheeses ’ composition and texture affected how well it browned and blistered – a desirable quality for pizza toppings			1
elasticity , oil content , moisture , water activity and ‘ transition temperature ’ all influence the colour uniformity of cheeses , they explained in the study , which was published in the @entity50			1
the scientists found that blisters – the dark spots seen on cheese – did n’t form using cheddar , colby , and @entity32 cheeses because of their small elasticity			1
scientists at the @entity29 evaluated different cheeses - mozzarella ( pictured left ) , cheddar ( right ) , colby , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , and provolone - to see how well they melted a sufficient amount of ‘ free oil ’ prevents moisture evaporation , so @entity34 and provolone did not brown easily , while @entity33 would not go golden at all			1
‘ these cheeses can be combined with the easily blistering mozzarella to create a gourmet pizza with a less burnt appearance , ’ they said			1
this is the first study to look at the composition of the ideal pizza , without relying on humans ’ taste buds , the researchers said			2
they have developed a computer vision technique to help manufacturers make better pizzas			2
last year , a mathematician devised a formula for the ' perfectly proportioned ' pizza , taking into account factors like the ratio of topping to base			0
she said that pizza lovers get more topping per bite in a smaller pizza , but a more even spread of bites in a larger pizza			0
size matters : a mathematician believes that a larger pizza must have a larger base to compensate for most spread - out toppings , while a smaller pizza needs a thicker base a mathematician claims to have come up with the first - ever formula for the ' perfectly proportioned ' pizza , taking into account factors like the ratio of topping to base			0
dr @entity101 said pizza lovers get more topping per bite in a smaller pizza , but a more even spread of bites in a larger pizza			0
the mathematician from the @entity108 , calculated a ratio to ensure maximum flavour of topping to base			0
it shows that even if a person keeps the same amount of dough and topping , the ratio of topping to base in an average bite changes with the size of the pizza and smaller pizzas typically have more topping per bite than larger ones			2
dr @entity101 said it is not only about how thick the base is , but about the balance of flavours between the topping and the dough that determines how much topping an individual can enjoy per bite			0
she used d as the constant volume of dough and t for the constant volume of topping to come up with a mathematical formula for the ratio of topping to base in a median bite			0
dr @entity101 calculated that in relative terms , the average bite taken from an 11 inch pizza has 10 per cent more topping than the average bite from a 14 inch pizza			0
the mathematician came up with these formulas as she was asked by chain restaurant @entity144 to work out why its 14 inch @entity147 pizzas , which have a thinner and crispier base than the @entity151 inch pizzas , are proving so popular .			2

@entity29 scientists evaluated different cheeses , such as mozzarella , cheddar @entity32 and @entity34 , to see how well they melted
they looked at how the texture affected how well it browned and blistered
less elastic cheeses like cheddar did **n't** blister , while cheeses with ' free oil ' like @entity34 did **n't** go brown when they were analysed
they can be mixed with mozzarella to create ' gourmet pizzas , ' study says
