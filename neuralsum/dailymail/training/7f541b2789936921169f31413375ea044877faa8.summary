by @entity0 last updated at 2:16 pm on 22nd june 2011 in scenes reminiscent of @entity2 , a desperate man has been caught on camera firing on a store owner and making a dramatic last stand against police			0
police say @entity9 , 45 , was gunned down after he refused to submit to two police officers in the @entity12 section of @entity13			1
they said @entity15 pointed his weapon at them and shouted : ' you are not going to take me alive '			0
so each cop fired a single round , hitting him twice in the chest			0
@entity9 later died at @entity23			2
they say he had exited a tyre shop on @entity47 11 minutes earlier , where he took several shots at merchant @entity49 , 49			1
mr @entity51 was struck in the hand and shoulder , according to the @entity54 , but he likely saved himself by holding his hand in front of his body and by his quick feet			0
when the shots started ringing out , he ran deep into the shop , down a maze of tires			0
he told police he was ' trying to run serpentine , but i ran out of room '			0
fleeing : @entity51 , 49 , narrowly escaped alive , after running down a maze of tyres			0
he suffered injuries only to his hand and shoulder hot pursuit : the shooter fires several more times at mr @entity49 , but he got away			2
police say @entity9 fled the shop , but was stopped by two officers eleven minutes later , where he was shot and killed police say mr @entity51 may have affiliations with the @entity31 crime family			1

police say @entity9 's brother is also in the mob			1
but instead of appearing like an orchestrated act of mob violence , police say they think @entity9 acted alone			1
getaway : police say @entity9 tried to get away in a livery cab after shooting at mr @entity49 final moment : as a police officer can be seen approaching through the rear window , @entity97 hesitates a moment			1
he then steps outside , and police say he shouted he would n't be taken alive , then pointed his gun it may have been a final desperate act of a suicidal man , since police say they found several suicide notes left to his mother and sister			1
@entity9 , who had been unemployed for three years , wrote : ' i can no longer live as a failure '			0
and so he walked into the tyre shop around 4:40 p.m. yesterday , armed with two .38 - caliber pistols , police say			1
he asked : ' are you @entity38 ? ' ' yeah , i 'm @entity38 ' , mr @entity51 responded			0
