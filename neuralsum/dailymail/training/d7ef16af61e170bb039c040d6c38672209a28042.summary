a gay couple are to become parents to three children by three women they met via surrogacy websites			1
for the past 15 years , @entity5 , 41 , and @entity6 , 50 , had longed to have children and joined a number of online forums in an attempt to find a suitable surrogate			1
they made contact with one of the women , @entity14 , 27 , and through her met @entity16 , 32 , and @entity17 , 32			1
mr @entity5 , 41 , is the biological father of two of the children , while mr @entity6 , 50 , gave his sperm for the third			1
all three babies will be born within seven months of each other , between january and july next year			1
' we love each other very much , but despite that it has felt like something was missing from our lives - our home felt empty without children , ' mr @entity6 told @entity42 's @entity41			1
' we never imagined in our wildest dreams we would have three all at once			0
' mr @entity5 and mr @entity6 , who live in @entity20 , had met online in 1999 , and entered into a civil partnership in 2012			1
surrogates : @entity14 ( right ) , @entity16 ( centre ) and @entity17 ( top left ) with their neighbour @entity47 ( top right ) and @entity16 's mother @entity49 ( left ) appeared on @entity51 's @entity50 in july to talk about surrogacy			1
when they appeared on the show , @entity16 was already carrying mr @entity6 and mr @entity5 's baby , @entity17 was preparing to , and @entity14 was days away from giving birth to another couple 's child helping others : @entity14 , who appeared in the show before giving birth to her third surrogate child , told the programme that she ' loves being pregnant ' they had considered adopting a child , but decided to try surrogacy after learning that singer @entity67 and his partner @entity68 had a child , @entity69 , by a surrogate mother in december 2010			1
their second son , @entity71 , was born via the same woman in january 2013			1
gay couples using a surrogate to have a child have only been able to apply for a parental order , giving them the legal rights over the child and relinquishing those of the surrogate since april 2010			2
mr @entity6 and mr @entity5 met @entity14 , but she was already helping another couple and was pregnant with her third surrogate child , so put them in touch with her former sister - in - law , @entity16			1
she in turn introduced them to her friend @entity87 , and both became pregnant , before @entity14 , having given birth to the other couple 's baby , decided she would help them too			1
mothers : the couple met @entity14 ( left ) online , and because she was already helping another couple have a child , she put them in touch with her former sister - in - law @entity16 ( right ) mr @entity5 said : ' while it is unorthodox to have three surrogates at the same time , we could n’t turn down what could be our only chance to have the big family we ’d always dreamed of			1
' the couple say their families are happy for them , and are extending their three - bedroom home to add extra bedrooms and bathrooms to fit their brood , who they have dubbed the ' twiplets '			0
both mr @entity6 and mr @entity5 plan to work part time , with one parent at home to care for the children , and mr @entity5 's parents will also move in to help them			1
the mothers say they had all wanted to help mr @entity6 and mr @entity5 become parents			1
' none of us can think of two people more deserving of the joy of fatherhood , ' said @entity14			2
the women appeared on @entity51 's @entity50 in june to speak about surrogacy , along with their neighbour @entity47 , and @entity16 's mother @entity49 , who has the nickname ' @entity131 ' and takes care of the women			2
at the time of the programme , @entity16 , who with her mother introduced @entity14 to surrogacy , was already pregnant after using mr @entity5 's sperm , while @entity14 was pregnant with the other couple 's child , and just one week away from giving birth			1
miss @entity17 was waiting to try to become pregnant			0
friend : @entity16 introduced the couple to @entity17 , 32 ' i absolutely love being pregnant , ' @entity14 said			1
' and that inspiration from @entity148 , wanting to help somebody - it 's so strong			0
' speaking about how her body reacted when having to hand the child over to its intended parents , she added : ' your body does wake up thinking it 's used to being pregnant and so it thinks there is a baby coming soon so your body does tell you to get up in the night			0
' @entity16 said it was seeing the joy on the faces of the intended parents when she hands over the babies that makes her want to be a surrogate , and that the feeling was addictive			2
she had wanted to become a surrogate since she was just 11 years old , after a friend of the family struggled to conceive			2
she said : ' it was just always there [ the need to help ] , growing up seeing that it was really hard to watch even as a kid			0
you just really wanted to help in some way			0
' she added : your body recovers a bit quicker because your not getting up in the night or to feed , you can recover a lot quicker so within a week i did n't look like i 'd had a child			0
' surrogacy @entity183 , a not for profit organisation which introduces surrogate mothers with intended parents said it was highly unusual for a couple to use more than one surrogate			1
trustee @entity190 told @entity191 : ' i think this is a really extreme case and it 's not something that would normally happen			0
' ms @entity190 said intended parents would be recommended to use just one surrogate by @entity183 , because of the trust needed between all parties , and the shortage of surrogates within the @entity183 caused by the fact it is illegal to pay women to carry a child			1
' there is a waiting list for couples who are waiting for them , ' she said			0
' the surrogate chooses the couple , not the other way around			2
they go on our waiting list and they wait to be chosen			0
' they come off the waiting list while they are waiting to become pregnant , they get to know the surrogate in depth			0
' if someone wanted to work with more than one surrogate they would have to do that independently			2
' ms @entity190 said the number of gay couples turning to surrogacy had increased since 2010			0
' the laws changed so gay couple could apply for parental orders , ' she said			2
' because of that law change we have seen an increase in gay couples coming to us			0
' there are two types of surrogacy , ' straight ' surrogacy , in which the surrogate uses her own egg and is also the biological mother , and ' host ' surrogacy , where the egg comes from another woman			2
under @entity183 law , it is illegal to pay a surrogate mother to carry a child , other than reasonable expenses such as travel costs , maternity clothing , care for her other children or counselling			1
agencies recommend these expenses amount to no more than £ 15,000			0
the woman who gives birth to the child is always treated as the legal mother , and has the right to keep the child - even if she is not genetically related to the baby			0
if she has one , the mother 's husband or boyfriend is regarded as the legal father , but if she is unmarried the name of the genetic father can be put on the birth certificate			0
the legal rights over the child are given to another intended parent through a parental order or adoption			0
in the @entity183 a parental order is only open to couples in a long - term relationship and following the grant of the order the child will be issued with a new birth certificate			2
gay couples using a surrogate to have a child have only been able to apply for a parental order since april 2010			0
surrogacy contracts are not enforced by @entity183 law , even if a contract has been signed with the intended parents and they have paid for any expenses			2
the birth mother is entitled to maternity leave , but the parents who she is carrying for do not currently have the same rights regarding maternity or paternity leave as those who have their children naturally or adopt. employers may offer paid leave , but this is at their discretion			0
however , this is set to change in april next year			0
in the @entity183 , just 83 surrogate births were registered in 2010 , but with surrogacy becoming more popular , this figure is expected to rise to 200 for this year			1
the shortage of surrogates in the @entity183 means some intended parents find surrogate mothers abroad			1
it is estimated that thousands of parents take this option , although there are no official figures .			0

@entity5 , 41 , and @entity6 , 50 , have always wanted to have children
couple from @entity20 , who met in 1999 , had considered adopting a child
they tried surrogacy after @entity67 had a son by a surrogate mother
couple met @entity14 online , and through her met two other mothers
all three babies will be born between january and july next year
using more than one mother at the same time is rare , says @entity183
there is a shortage of surrogates in the @entity183 because of laws over payment
