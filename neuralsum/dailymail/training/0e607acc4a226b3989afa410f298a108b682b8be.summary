by @entity0 an entertaining university student took home $ 100,000 from game show @entity3 on monday night without being certain of a single answer to any of the questions			1
@entity6 , a second year law student from @entity7 , was calm and more than a little cheeky , as he joked with host @entity8 and plugged his @entity11 page in between each round			1
' i 'd buy 10 jet - skis , for me and all my friends ... i 'd have my name on the side ' , he revealed when asked what he would spend the jackpot on if he won			1
he attributed his win to his ability to read body language , and said his strategy involved repeating the answers back to @entity37 to gauge his response			2
' i did n’t play the game — i played the man , ' he told news.com.au			0
though it is entirely possible this admission is just another part of the performance which kept viewers entertained throughout			0
@entity24 had the audience in stitches the whole time he was in the chair , cracking jokes and jumping between options before locking in one of the multiple choice answers in a seemingly random manner			0
the prankster joked his way through the questions , and proclaimed each time one popped up on the screen ' i have no idea ' each time a question popped up on the screen , his reaction was the same : ' i have no idea			0
' he even asked @entity37 ' if i win or lose can i take a selfie ? ' the first question he was asked who @entity67 was , a man well - known for his work in law , the field which @entity24 is studying in			1
before he answered he cheekily proclaimed in a hilarious act of self - promotion ' would n't have a clue , it kind of reminds me of my @entity11 name @entity77 , ' as he stared straight down the barrel of the camera			0
when it got to the $ 100,000 question and @entity37 quipped that the law student had n't been certain of any answer so far , the 19 - year - old was quick to respond			1
@entity6 said early in the program he would buy 10 jet - skis for him and all his friends if he won the money ' maybe i make you think that i do n't know the answers ' , @entity6 said with a straight face , sending the audience into fits of laughter once again			1
the final question asked who the artist behind 1908 masterpiece @entity95 was , and the @entity7 man nearly went with @entity100 because ' i know he 's popular			0
' at the last second he locked in @entity102 , and had a very good reason for doing so			0
the 19 - year - old appeared to guess each answer , but said he was actually reading host @entity8 ' if you wan na know my thought process it 's like i have n't done @entity109 in a while so i 'll choose that			1
' whether he was lucky or just much smarter than he let on , the 19 - year - old still left up the show with much more money than he came with			0
however he admitted he might stick to just one jet - ski instead of 10 , as his previous promise was causing some trouble between his friends			2
the @entity7 man made sure to plug his @entity11 page and ask for a selfie with @entity8 while on tv			2
