it may be more than 13,300 years old , but a spear made using the horn of a woolly rhino horn has been unearthed - and it is still sharp enough to kill today			1
the spear was discovered on the island of @entity5 , off the north coast of @entity7 and is the first tool from this era found so far north			1
it was was used by @entity12 man in the @entity13 , and has been shown to @entity15 president @entity14 on a recent visit to @entity17			1
straight to the point : a spear made from woolly rhino horn , which was used by @entity12 man in the @entity13 , is still sharp enough to be used today			1
it is almost 35inches ( 90cm ) in length the horn was uncovered by paleontologists searching for mammoth remains on the @entity13 island			2
@entity27 , director of the @entity28 at @entity29 in @entity17 , said : ‘ this find helps our understanding of how far north people penetrated in the @entity34			0
‘ at the same time , there are no analogues in the world for this discovery , ’ he told @entity35			0
the discovery was 240 miles ( 386 km ) north of earlier finds of tools and implements of ancient man , at a site on the @entity46 , also in the @entity47			0
@entity48 rhino horn is known to has been used in making spears , but the latest evidence shows it formed the weapon 's tip , - almost 35inches ( 90cm ) in length			1

it helps experts understand how far north people penetrated in the @entity34			2
the spear was probably used by ancient man to kill woolly mammoths and rhinos , demonstrating their considerable hunting abilities			2
@entity48 rhino horn is known to has been used in making spears , but the latest evidence shows it formed the weapon 's tip , - almost 35m inches ( 90cm ) in length			1
it is first time we see that the tip - and such a long tip - was made of rhino horn			2
experts believe that the spear could have been used to kill woolly mammoths and rhinos , both of which became extinct thousands of years ago in @entity7			1

‘ it is first time we see that the tip - and such a long tip - was made of rhino horn , ' said mr @entity27			2
‘ the woolly rhino 's horn is rather hard , but flexible at the same time			1
‘ it consists of keratin - a substance that makes up our hair and nails			0
deer horn or cow horn , by contrast , consist of bone substance			0
’ the weapon was dated as being 13,300 years old after analysis by @entity108 in the @entity109			0
the spear was discovered on the island of @entity5 ( shown on the map ) , off the north coast of @entity7 and is the first tool from this era found so far north mr @entity27 expects other rhino spears may be found , and further evidence of early man uncovered on the island of @entity5 ( pictured ) , which is part of the @entity121 , or @entity122 , archipelago scientists say that stone spear points used by our ancestors 500,000 years ago , are comparable to bullets that expand on impact because they create large ‘ wounds ’			1
in august , researchers announced that they think that the use of stone tips had a large impact on human evolution because it allowed early humans to hunt large animals effectively			2
experts tested stone - tipped and sharpened wooden spears and found that both had the same penetrating power			0
however , the stone point caused far more damage and was likened to the hollow - nose or ‘ dum - dum ’ bullet that expand on impact and are more destructive than regular bullets			0
the study involved shooting six stone - tipped and six sharpened wooden spears into gelatine and examining the degree of penetration and damage they produced			0
all were fired from a cross-bow with the same amount of force			0
scientists found that the stone - tipped spears created a significantly larger and wider ‘ wound ’ cavity			0
dr @entity162 , of @entity163 , said : ‘ hafting a stone point to the end of a spear was an important innovation that changed life for @entity170 humans			0
‘ humans with stone - tipped spears were more likely to kill the game that they targeted , and were able to secure high quality food resources more frequently and regularly			0
’ mr @entity27 expects other rhino spears may be found and further evidence of early man uncovered on the island , which is part of the @entity121 , or @entity122 , archipelago			2
the spear suggests that early siberians were accomplished hunters			0
‘ @entity48 rhinos were rather dangerous animals , and hunting them could be regarded as a huge trophy , ’ he said			0
‘ the spear is also in one - piece , so it could be made only from the horn of a big , mature rhino			2
’ while woolly rhino died out some 12,000 years ago in @entity7 , mammoth roamed the area until around 4,000 years ago			1
experts believe that the spear ( pictured ) could have been used to kill woolly mammoths and rhinos , both of which became extinct thousands of years ago in @entity7 the discovery was 240 miles ( 386 km ) north of earlier finds of tools and implements of ancient man , at a site on the @entity46 , also in the @entity47 .			1

@entity203 was discovered on the island of @entity5 , @entity7
it 's the first tool from the @entity12 era found so far north
@entity203 is almost 35inches ( 90cm ) in length and made of woolly rhino horn
it was likely used to hunt these animals as well as woolly mammoths
@entity203 has been revealed to @entity15 president @entity14
experts think more may be found in the remote northern area of the island
