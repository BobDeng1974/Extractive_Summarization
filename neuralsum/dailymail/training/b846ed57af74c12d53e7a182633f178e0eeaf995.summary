@entity0 and @entity1 came across each other again in a tumbledown corner of south east @entity4 and began informal man - to - man discussions about an alternative superbout in case @entity8 fails to call either of them for his next megafight			1
@entity1 and @entity0 are friends and sparring partners and they met up at the century - old @entity13 which is squeezed in a tunnel of bricks and aluminium that forms part of a railway - line archway in @entity19			1
they did stand in the old ring which has produced some of @entity24 ’s finest prizefighters but declined the suggestion of swapping a few punches			0
@entity0 ( left ) was in @entity4 on friday to discuss a potential future fight with @entity24 's @entity1 @entity0 's ( left ) arrival was greeted enthusiastically by fans who wanted the boxer 's signature @entity0 met up at the century - old @entity13 in @entity19 to discuss a possible megafight the visit of ring royalty to this dusty but hallowed corner of boxing came at the end of @entity0 ’s visit to @entity4 which included thursday night ’s dinner with boxing fan @entity41 at @entity42			1
@entity1 prefaced the reunion by visiting @entity45 stadium which has been mooted as a venue if he ever agrees to a battle of @entity24 with @entity48			1
but this engagement has an eye to him meeting @entity0 here			2
if that is to happen , @entity8 would have to pass on the two leading contenders to face him in @entity53 on may 2			0
@entity1 is aware that @entity8 versus @entity0 is the $ 300million spectacular which most of the world wants to see and that global audience would have been excited to hear @entity0 telling me : ‘ i think now that @entity8 and me is going to happen			1
’ @entity1 , pictured getting out of his gold @entity60 , had hoped to fight @entity8 in may @entity1 gave a beaming smile to the camera as he arrived at @entity63 this is the closest either @entity8 or @entity0 have come to predicting a real likelihood of the barriers blocking the way of the richest fight of all time are as good as removed			1
even so , the @entity0 is putting @entity70 in place with @entity1			1
as @entity0 continued his state visit to @entity4 his advisor @entity72 told me : ‘ just in case @entity8 does n't come through we regard @entity1 as the best possible alternative			1
he and @entity0 would make for a very exciting fight and @entity0 would be more than happy to do it at @entity45			2
‘ we are looking at that possibility and also @entity81 as another potential venue			0
‘ but of course we are still working on @entity8			0
’ @entity1 said : ‘ i ’ve been looking at @entity45 which would be a great stage for me and @entity0 and @entity81 is very much in the running			1
‘ it was great seeing @entity0 again			2
we talked a bit about old times and also about the future			0
although we have this friendship , if fighting each other makes sense then it can certainly happen			0
’ @entity1 ( left ) beat @entity93 in @entity53 to win the @entity95 welterweight title last december @entity1 set a mid-january deadline for @entity8 to deliver on his long - standing promise of giving the young man from @entity99 the biggest fight of his life			1
that has passed but with @entity8 still deliberating khan would obviously respond eagerly if the offer was still to come			0
@entity8 has a third option in one of his former victims , @entity106 , who would bring plenty of @entity110 interest to a @entity53 on the weekend of a major @entity112 state holiday			0
@entity0 set his own @entity8 deadline as january 31 but he was more confident then at any other time so far that it will be met as he arrived at @entity13			1
he was greeted by dozens of cheering young @entity4 boxers and their trainers as he came through that creaking old door			2
there was also a rousing rendition of the @entity19 walk as @entity1 arrived a few minutes later			2
@entity0 ( right ) defeated @entity122 easily on an unanimous points decision last november @entity0 said : ‘ the dinner with prince @entity41 was very enjoyable and i am really pleased to come to a boxing place like this			1
' he also confirmed a fight with @entity1 could take place			2
' yes , there 's a big possibility , nothing personal , we 're just doing our job in the ring , ' he said on @entity135			0
' it 's not difficult for us because we respect each other and we 're just doing our job in the ring			0
' as for his hopes on fighting @entity8 , @entity0 maintained he has done everything in his power to make the bout happen and it is now in the @entity145 's hands			2
' we 're waiting for the answer from them , the signed contract from them , probably next week we will know if the fight ( can be ) pushed through or not , ' he added			0
@entity1 was greeted just as enthusiastically and then said to @entity151 : ‘ great			0
