@entity1 's account of key issues at the heart of the prosecution case against him has changed over the four years since his wife 's murder in @entity8 and his trial the story @entity1 gave to his in - laws about the night his new bride was murdered four years ago is at odds with what his @entity8 trial has heard in recent weeks			1
a plea explanation , which was read out in court by his lawyer , was dismissed by the detective who made the case against @entity1 in court as ' a newly - fabricated story '			1
in the 37 - page document , read out by his lawyer at the start of his trial , @entity1 provided his first justification for @entity29 footage and phone records which revealed he met privately with @entity31 , the taxi driver who accused the businessman of ordering the murder of his wife			1
their two meetings - totalling almost an hour together alone - plus a string of text messages and calls in the 24 hours leading up to the murder of @entity40 , 28 , were not mentioned by @entity1 in interviews with four police officers or at the two - hour meeting with his family			1
the new statement also sees @entity1 admitting for the first time to carrying a large sum of cash in the car on the night the honeymooners were ambushed by gunmen – and an ' alibi ' for having it			1
however , comparing his stories told soon after the dramatic killing of his wife and his recent recollection , the businessman 's story becomes vague on essential details - such as how he was freed from @entity31 's taxi before his wife was driven off to her death			1
@entity1 , 34 , was accused of plotting with cab driver @entity31 , @entity64 and gunman @entity65 to kill @entity40 while they were on their honeymoon in @entity68 in november 2010			1
he denies all charges including kidnapping , murder and defeating the ends of justice			0
here , @entity74 has compared his two accounts given four years apart to highlight the variations on the key issues at the heart of the prosecution case against him			0
taxi driver @entity31 ( above ) was sentenced to 18 years for his part in arranging the honeymoon murder contact with @entity82 : @entity29 footage seized by police from the @entity86 hotel and @entity1 's and @entity31 's phone records revealed the two men had met alone twice – for 13 minutes and 45 minutes – in the 24 hours before @entity40 's murder			1
in addition , during the same period they exchanged 12 phone communications - calls and text messages			0
security film also shows the two men talking alone together at the hotel on the morning after the carjacking and two days later , on the day @entity1 leaves @entity8 , when and leads the driver down a hotel corridor to a quiet business centre where he hands over a bag containing cash			2
2010 : in the transcript of the two - hour family crisis talks , @entity1 specifically denies meeting or having any contact with @entity31 between the time the driver dropped the honeymooners off at their five - star hotel and 24 hours later to take them out for dinner , apart from a brief call or message to make that arrangement			1
@entity1 makes no mention of meeting @entity31 in the hours before the fatal carjacking , on 13 november 2010 , or two more rendezvous at his hotel in the days after			2
caught on cctv : in one video clip shown to the courtroom , @entity1 is captured leading alleged fixer @entity31 down a hotel corridor to a quiet room , carrying a small bag in the meeting 's record , @entity122 asks his brother about friday 12 november , the day before the murder , when @entity31 dropped the couple at their hotel			1
@entity1 fails to mention that after checking in , he went back outside to talk alone with @entity31 in his car			0
@entity122 : ' so this guy , you have n't spoken to him again that night [ friday ? ] @entity1 : no , uh uh , he left us when he dropped us at six and that was it			2
@entity1 confirms he contacted @entity31 by phone ' at lunchtime ' on the day of the murder to arrange for him to pick them up that evening and drive them to a restaurant			0
@entity122 , apparently trying to work out if @entity31 had sufficient time to plan the carjacking , asks : ' so the earliest he knew he was going to be used by you was lunchtime ? ' @entity1 : ' yes , or just before			0
' 2014 : in his plea explanation to the court , @entity1 admits to the two private meetings with @entity31 in the 24 hours before his wife 's death and exchanging text messages and calls			1
the contact was necessary and private , his explanation says , as @entity31 was organising a helicopter ride on behalf of @entity1 as a surprise honeymoon treat for @entity40			2
the cost of the trip was @entity158 , 000 – exactly the same sum of money that @entity31 told the court @entity1 was prepared to pay for the contract killing of his wife			2
evidence : the opening shot of the surveillance camera sequence shown to the @entity8 court shows suspect @entity1 walking through the foyer of the @entity86 hotel days after his new wife 's murder follow me : @entity1 leads the way as he takes the cab driver to a part of the hotel not covered by @entity29 @entity176 : 2010 : in his account to @entity40 's family shortly after her funeral , @entity1 makes no mention of any significant sums of cash he had on him at the time of the armed ambush			1
in the transcript , he recalls handing over an unspecified amount of money that was in his left trouser pocket , along with valuables such as his phone and designer watch			0
he makes no reference to any money in his wife 's bag , which was stolen by the two armed robbers			2
' i think she gave him the handbag because the phone was in the handbag , ' he says during the meeting			0
2014 : four years later , @entity1 informed the court , via @entity205 , his senior barrister , that a significant sum of cash was being carried by the couple on the night of the murder			1
prosecutors allege the bundle of notes – @entity213 , 000 , around £ 850 at the exchange rate of the time - which he had put in his wife 's bag , plus @entity218 , 000 ( £ 425 ) more in his pockets , was payment for his wife 's killers			1
' i took the @entity213 , 000 i had exchanged in order to pay a deposit [ for the helicopter ride ] … i asked @entity40 to put the money in her handbag			0
' i also had about @entity228 , 000 in my pocket to pay for dinner , and the taxi fare of @entity232 , 000 previously agreed , ' the statement read			0
the bundles of cash - fortunes in poverty - stricken @entity8 - or what they were intended for , were not disclosed to any of the four policemen who interviewed @entity1 in the hours and days after his wife 's fatal shooting			1
captain @entity241 , the senior detective who became suspicious of @entity1 a day after his wife 's sudden death , said the first he knew about the cash or the helicopter was on the opening day of the businessman 's trial , eight weeks ago			1
knowledge of the money would have immediately made @entity31 a prime suspect and changed the course of the murder investigation , the detective told the @entity253			0
middle man and trigger man : @entity64 ( left ) was sentenced to 25 years in prison for his part as a go - between in the plot to kill mrs @entity260 , while @entity65 ( right ) was convicted of firing the fatal shots @entity262 was freed by his wife 's killers : 2010 : in his version to the @entity266 about how he came to be freed from the car unscathed , which his mother - in - law appeared to found implausible , @entity1 describes how one of the gunmen got out of the @entity271 in a futile attempt to open a rear door and free him , before forcing him out through a window instead			1
' he tried to open the door from the outside – and it would not open … ' @entity1 tells the family , adding that he was instead ejected through a passenger window as the car continued to move			0
' he then just pushed my head through the window and just rolled me out like a roly poly onto the road			0
' @entity1 's account of how he was freed from the taxi ( above ) before his wife was shot dead differed over time 2014 : by the time he offers an explanation to his murder trial , @entity1 's recollection of how he was forced out of the car , and whether the car was moving at the time or not , is vague			1
' they became angrier and shouted at me to get out			0
the one with the gun put it to my head again and threatened to shoot me if i did not get out			0
' i tried to open the door but it would not open			0
i recall the window opening			0
i recall hitting the ground and the car speeding away , ' his statement reads			0
in an apparent effort to explain why his most recent account of events lacks the specific details that he recalled in his police interviews , @entity1 claims : ' as a consequence of the traumatic experience which resulted in the loss of my wife , i have been hospitalised for over three years and suffered from severe post traumatic stress disorder			2
' this , and the resultant flashbacks , nightmares and anxiety attacks , have affected my memory and impacted on my ability to precisely and chronologically recall events concerning this terrible incident			2
' @entity1 was accused of orchestrating a plot to kill his new bride @entity40 on their @entity8 honeymoon			2

record of his account to wife 's family in 2010 at odds with one at his trial
his plea explanation dismissed by detective as ' a newly - fabricated story '
provides first justification for meeting taxi driver convicted of her murder
admits for first time he was carrying large sum of cash on night of killing
story about how he was freed from taxi before @entity40 was shot also differs
@entity1 says memory was affected by ' trauma , flashbacks and nightmares '
