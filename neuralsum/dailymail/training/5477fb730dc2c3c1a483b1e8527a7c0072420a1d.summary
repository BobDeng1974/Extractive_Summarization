by @entity0 @entity1 : 10:32 est , 13 december 2013 @entity2 : 14:04 est , 13 december 2013 it 's @entity4 time and it is n't just a season of good will and cheer , it 's also the most likely time to conceive			1
@entity9 for the @entity10 indicate the most birthdays fall in september - making december a prime baby - making month			1
some parents may plot a december conception on purpose to achieve an all - important september birthday , making their child one of the oldest in their class at school which has been proven to give them an academic advantage			1
love is in the air : the festive spirit helps many couples conceive in december but other couples struggling with fertility issues are n't as lucky as to be able to plan a conception			1
so @entity30 , relationship expert for @entity31 , said december can also be an excellent opportunity for those who have been trying for a baby to finally get lucky			1
she explains : ' if you are trying for a baby , @entity4 is a great opportunity to make the most of your time off together			1
and the cold weather also means that your partner 's sperm quality is higher too			2
' trying to conceive puts pressure and stress on couples , but remember to enjoy the experience			1
' @entity30 recommends women keen to conceive should make the most of the cosy nights in the winter months provide and have some fun rather than stressing about getting pregnant			1
she said : ' it 's important to enjoy the simple pleasures of sex and not just save it for when you 're at your most fertile , ’ says @entity30			2
‘ conceiving a baby should be a joyous affair , however long it takes			0
if you get stuck in the routine of only having sex on your fertile days , it can be difficult to see making love as anything more than a baby - making process			0
' she added : ‘ december is the ideal time to reconnect sexually with your partner - it 's what cosy winter nights were meant for ! watch a sexy movie together or dress up and role - play in some seductive kit			2
many outfits include props like gloves , feather boas or corsets			0
they always feel appropriate in the winter			0
' get out those stockings and suspenders , which probably have n't seen the light of day during the summer months			0
' be safe : @entity4 festivities can also lead to some unplanned pregnancies if contraception is forgotten in a drunken fling but while some couples may be hoping december will bring them a much - longed for baby , others might find it an unwelcome consequence of the festive season			1
@entity30 explained : ' the lead up to @entity4 is becoming ever longer			0
it 's party season , we 're in a good mood and the drink is flowing			0
it 's easy to be forgetful in all the merriment			0
it 's not only a time of celebration , it 's also the month when we 're likely to forget to use our contraception			0
' for those who do n't want to end up with a baby in 2014 thanks to a drunken festive fling , she has the following advice			1
' if you 're on the pill , try and take it at a regular time each morning in december , perhaps leaving the packet on your bedside table as a reminder for you , if you 're tempted to forget			2
' if you use a barrier method of contraception , such as a cap , pop it in before you go out for the evening			0
alternatively , invest in a few festive condoms - there are loads of fun varieties available - and keep those in your bag or again , on the bedside table			2
that way you 'll be making seasonal merriment without making a baby ! '			0
