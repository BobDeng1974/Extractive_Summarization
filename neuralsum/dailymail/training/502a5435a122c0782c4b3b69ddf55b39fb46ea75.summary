@entity0 , a @entity1 lawyer , was known as ' @entity2 ' and may have been the inspiration behind @entity5 's @entity4 a @entity1 lawyer who was known as ' @entity2 ' and turned to crime after noticing his clients were getting rich may have been the real life inspiration behind @entity10			1
@entity0 was born in @entity11 in 1874 , before his family moved to @entity13 when he was five			1
after supporting his family by working in a pharmacy from the age of 14 , he bought the pharmacy at 19 , expanded and bought another in his early twenties before deciding to become a lawyer aged 24			0
he specialised in criminal defence , particularly in murder cases and by 1920 he was earning $ 50,000 a year - a huge amount at the time			0
in 1920 @entity0 divorced his first wife @entity23 after embarking on an affair with his legal secretary , @entity25 , whom he subsequently married			1
that year @entity26 decided to ban toting or selling alcohol - but bizarrely , drinking was still allowed			1
' @entity0 soon noticed the criminals he was defending were getting rich off bootlegging , ' @entity29 of the @entity30 told the @entity33			1
' he saw all this money and thought he 'd better get in on the action			0
' @entity0 began studying the @entity36 – the law that enforced @entity38 – and soon found several loopholes			1
his pharmaceutical background came in handy when he realized the loopholes meant he could buy distilleries and pharmacies to sell ' bonded ' liquor to himself under government licenses for ' medicinal ' purposes			0
@entity0 's employees would then ' steal ' his liquor so he could sell it on illegally			1
by this point he had moved to @entity1 and bought up most of the whiskey manufacturers			1
in less than three years @entity0 made $ 40 million - in today 's currency almost $ 900 million			1
@entity0 shared many characteristics with the character of @entity4 ( pictured is @entity54 actor @entity53 as @entity4 in the 2013 film ) - he was overly generous , ostentatious and yet introverted he owned many of @entity58 's most famous distilleries , including the @entity59 , which he bought for $ 197,000 - a price which included 3,100 gallons of whiskey			1
in addition to becoming the ' king of the @entity64 ' @entity0 was known as a generous host			1
he held many parties , including a 1923 birthday party for @entity68 in which she appeared in a daring bathing suit , serenaded by a fifteen - piece orchestra			0
@entity0 enjoyed flaunting his wealth - his mansion in @entity73 was decorated in rare art and exotic plants			2
for his daughter @entity76 he installed a massive indoor pool at a reported cost of $ 125,000			0
he was renowned for throwing lavish galas and events where he showered guests with expensive gifts			0
@entity83 ( pictured left ) had an affair with @entity0 before he divorced his first wife			2
he later shot and killed her after she spent his money while he was in prison			0
the cover of the novel @entity10 ( right ) he and his wife held a @entity90 at their mansion in 1922			2
as parting gifts , @entity0 presented all the men with diamond watches and gave each woman a brand new car			1
but despite his overt generosity @entity0 was an introvert			2
he did not drink or smoke and during parties he would sometimes retreat to his personal library – much like @entity4			0
mr @entity29 said : ' @entity5 met @entity0 by chance at a hotel in @entity104			1
' the writer was fascinated with this larger - than - life personality , and based the eponymous character in ' @entity10 ' on @entity0			1
' there used to be a photo of @entity0 surrounded by the police chief , @entity111 and @entity5 , all in laughter			1
he truly was a character that transcends time			0
' @entity0 was also seen as charitable , donating money and presents to those in need - along with those who were perhaps not so needy			2
' @entity0 had an untold amount of bribes to the police , lawyers and government , ' mr @entity29 said			2
he allegedly even paid off the @entity58 attorney general of the time			0
writer @entity5 met @entity0 ( pictured ) by chance at a hotel in @entity104 and was fascinated with this larger - than - life personality - he apparently based the eponymous character in ' @entity10 ' on @entity0 but his luck finally ran out and in 1925 he was charged with thousands of violations of the @entity36 and was sentenced to a two - year prison term in @entity132			1
but according to biographers he still managed to throw a lavish party on his private train coach to @entity136			0
while behind bars he enjoyed his meals at the prison chaplain 's residence , his cell was always decorated with flowers and he was even waited on by servants			0
his cellmate was @entity145 and the pair got on so well @entity0 even confided how he was hiding his personal assets from the government - by keeping his wife @entity68 in charge of his estate			2
but @entity152 was an undercover @entity154 agent , sent to prison to investigate a corrupt warden			0
@entity152 , for his part , did not tell the agency but instead resigned his post and headed to @entity1			2
there he embarked on an affair with @entity83 and helped to spend most of her husband 's empire , leaving @entity165			0
she sold his mansion , his distilleries and all of his possessions , leaving him just $ 100			0
after @entity0 left prison @entity68 filed for divorce , but on her way to the courthouse to finalise it @entity0 had his cab driver chase her down			2
she was forced to abandon her vehicle in @entity176 and in front of a shocked crowd @entity0 shot and killed her			0
@entity0 owned this property on @entity181 in @entity1 , @entity182 during the peak of his career the subsequent trial attracted national attention			1
the prosecution was led by @entity188 , the son of former president @entity189			0
despite the testimony of several witnesses , @entity0 was found not guilty by reason of insanity			0
there were rumours of trial fraud , a theory that appeared proven when @entity0 threw a celebratory party after the verdict with all 12 jurors in attendance			1
@entity0 ' stay in the asylum was short as he used @entity189 's reasoning that he was not insane to get himself back out again			1
a free @entity0 tried to restart his bootlegging venture , but found other bootleggers had taken control of the market in his absence and so he retired , dying in 1952 of natural causes aged 77 .			0
