by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 was left to rue the one that got away after falling further adrift of @entity7 team - mate @entity6 in this season 's @entity9 title scrap			1
a blistering start and stunning first lap in the @entity14 @entity13 only made @entity2 further regret what transpired during qualifying			1
mistakes in the final session resulted in @entity2 failing to set a time and starting from ninth on the grid at the @entity22			2
team game : @entity2 is 29 points adrift of @entity6 after finishing behind his team - mate in @entity14 winners : @entity7 celebrated their sixth one - two finish of the campaign at the @entity14 @entity13 come the end of lap one @entity2 had made up five places and had the leading trio of @entity34 pair @entity33 and @entity35 , along with @entity7 team - mate @entity6 in his sights			1
when the chequered flag dropped 70 laps later , clever strategy from @entity7 had allowed @entity6 and @entity2 to claim a sixth one - two in eight races this year , with @entity35 third ahead of @entity33			2
@entity2 , though , is now 29 points adrift of @entity6 heading into his home race of the @entity43 @entity13 at @entity44 in a fortnight			1
' i got one of the best starts i 've ever had really and positioned the car in the correct places , ' said @entity2			2
thumbs up : @entity2 has vowed to bounce back at the @entity43 @entity13 in a fortnight 's time ' it would have been great if i 'd started where perhaps i should have started this weekend , so after what happened in qualifying it was all about damage limitation for me			1
' i 'm as happy as i can be with a @entity59 finish			0
i had the pace in the car all weekend , but i was n't able to capitalise on that so second place from a bad weekend is pretty good			0
' the strategy worked really well for me to get into second position , then i tried to start pushing @entity6 , but he did n't make any mistakes and i did n't have the chance to overtake			2
' to get another one - two , though , is just incredible			0
' with the @entity43 @entity13 on the horizon , a race @entity2 has not won since 2008 , the 29 - year - old said : ' next race is in @entity44 and all the positive energy from my home fans that goes with that			1
' it will be a special time , and i 'll be going all out for the win			0
' shake on it : @entity2 congratulates @entity6 on his third win of the campaign on sunday for @entity6 , in extending his advantage over @entity2 , his third win this season and sixth of his career was mission accomplished			1
' twenty - nine points is a nice gap , but it 's still so early in the season , ' said @entity6			1
' i really like to concentrate on each weekend , taking it step by step and every weekend my aim is to extend the championship lead , which i managed to do this weekend			0
' behind the leading quartet @entity93 's @entity92 was fifth ahead of @entity96 's @entity95 , @entity98 's @entity97 and @entity99 in his @entity100			0
as for @entity99 's team - mate @entity102 , the reigning quadruple champion was forced to retire for the third time this season , as many as in the previous three years combined			0
