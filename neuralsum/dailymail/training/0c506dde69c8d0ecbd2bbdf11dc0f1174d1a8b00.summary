they had travelled from their homes in @entity29 to @entity30 , the most northerly point on the @entity33 mainland			0
' we travelled the distance in an @entity52 and it took us a week , ' said mr @entity5			1
mr @entity5 's journal documented the stop - off in @entity10			1
he said : ' i had to record everything we spent because my friend and i were splitting the cost of the trip ' ' the car only did 35mph at best and it was blizzard weather - the snow was coming into the car			0
' we called at @entity10 on the way back and we ’d heard about the mint cake , so when we saw some we thought we ’d buy a bar			2
' mr @entity5 said he was not sure why he had kept the bar in a box in his loft			1
' it was on a shelf as a memento of the trip but it ’s been in the loft since we moved to @entity19 16 years ago , ' he said			2
the bar is still in reasonable condition although some of the sugar is seeping through the wrapping			2
although the original @entity85 's recipe is still used , the company was sold to @entity86 's in 1987			0
@entity8 's invented the climbers ' favourite energy bar - made of glucose and peppermint - by accident back in 1869 , while trying to make glacier mints			2
although the original @entity85 's recipe is still used , the company was sold to @entity86 's in 1987 managing director @entity94 said : ' we have been making it all these years and i do n’t think we have any that old - it ’s impressive			0
' it would n’t do him any harm to eat it now but i do n’t expect it would taste very nice			0
' mr @entity5 said what was also interesting to discover was the journal he wrote while travelling , which documented the stop - off in @entity10			1
he said : ' i had to record everything we spent because my friend and i were splitting the cost of the trip			0
' it ’s funny now to look back and see that someone offered to sell us a car engine and gear box for £ 2.50 , and that 15 litres of petrol was 60p			0
' unfortunately , the price of the mint cake was n’t included , although i did write that we ’d visited and purchased it			0
