sitting in the afternoon sun , @entity0 calmly writes in her journal while her fiancé , @entity3 , watches over her			1
the couple – who have known each other since their schooldays – look like any other young lovers enjoying a spring afternoon at home in @entity11 , @entity12 , 27 , is now just hours away from learning if she will become a convicted murderer for the second time when a court in @entity16 , some 5,000 miles away , delivers its verdict tomorrow			1
wearing a casual vest and jeans and with her short hair tied back in a knot , the creative writing graduate must have a number of things going through her mind to jot down as the new judgement over the bloody murder of @entity30 exchange student @entity28 in 2007 eases closer			1
@entity12 served four years in prison after she was originally convicted of the crime alongside ex-boyfriend @entity34 and @entity28 , but a second ruling in 2011 declared her innocent and she returned to her native @entity36			2
@entity0 ’s seemingly relaxed demeanour was a far cry from the telling body language of her mother , @entity41 , on tuesday , the day before the new verdict had originally been due to be given			1
' he said @entity0 was ' worried , very worried ' @entity0 's mother , @entity41 , has tried to distract herself with the family shopping but she can barely hide her inner turmoil on behalf of her daughter , who once again faces the prospect of a life sentence behind bars for her alleged role in the death of @entity30 exchange student @entity70			1
@entity41 had risen at around 05.30 am wednesday morning at her home in @entity44 and around an hour later was joined by ex-husband @entity12 , 54 , who lives nearby			1
no doubt they were waiting for the final verdict in the case , which has dragged on for eight years and already seen @entity12 and her co-accused , former boyfriend @entity34 , 30 , acquitted once			0
after the 2011 acquittal @entity12 , 28 , returned to her hometown of @entity44 , @entity79 , after having served four years in an @entity81 prison			1
she is currently believed to be staying at her mother 's house			2
however , the ruling was overturned in 2013 , and @entity12 was handed a sentence of 28 and a half years in prison			0
her current case is an appeal against that sentence which could either be upheld – and see her once again declared guilty – acquit her entirely , or the case could be sent back for another round of appeals			0
physical and forensic evidence in the brutal murder of @entity70 – who was stabbed and had her throat cut – has been hotly contested throughout the trials , as has both @entity12 and @entity34 's version of events that night			2
@entity12 and her family now face another agonizing day before a new verdict is given			0
speaking at court in @entity16 on wednesday , @entity12 's lawyer , @entity54 said her ' conviction is not justice – but a distortion of the facts '			2
in his closing statement he asked the court to overturn the guilty verdict , and added : ' we are confronted with a very grave judicial error that must be set right			1
' @entity0 is just hours away from learning her fate @entity114 changed his story earlier this week claiming he now does not remember whether @entity12 was with him at the time of @entity28 's murder asked about how his client had been in the last few days , he said : ' worried , very worried			1
' @entity34 remains in @entity81 – where his passport has been confiscated to stop him fleeing - and was present for the hearing in court			1
if @entity12 is convicted @entity81 courts will have to ask for her extradition , which will lead to another round of legalities in the @entity36 to determine whether or not she will finally be sent to prison again , and where			0
that decision would ultimately be left in the hands of secretary of state @entity132			0
on tuesday afternoon @entity41 , 52 , a mathematics teacher in the @entity135 area of @entity44 , had shopped for groceries at a local supermarket before heading to the @entity44 area of the city where she lives with husband @entity140 , 40 , and daughters @entity142 , 20 , and @entity143 , 15			2
they appeared to have a number of visitors , who were no doubt wishing them luck with the scheduled verdict			0
however , after it was delayed , the curtains in the house remained closed all day wednesday			0
since her return to @entity44 , @entity12 has tried to get on with a normal life and had resumed studies at the @entity159 and even took on freelance work at a local newspaper , the @entity161			0
@entity12 's new guy : @entity0 was pictured out with fiance @entity3 in @entity162			1
he is an aspiring rock musician @entity0 's mom will have to wait until tomorrow to learn the @entity81 court 's decision she even found love , first with classical music student @entity167 and then with @entity162 - based musician @entity3 , whom she announced her engagement to in february of this year			1
@entity12 has become increasingly distanced from @entity34 , who changed his story earlier this week , claiming he now does not remember whether @entity12 was with him at the time of @entity28 's murder			2
he claimed in documents presented to court on tuesday he ca n't be sure she was at his house for the whole of the night @entity70 was murdered			0
@entity176 , an @entity81 criminal trial lawyer claimed @entity34 was making the claims in a last ditch attempt to save his own skin			0
he said : ' you could say he is throwing her to the wolves			0
it is bad for @entity0 ' s defense but it might not be good for @entity34 's defense either			0
the lawyers are probably trying this approach as a very last resort			0
' one person , @entity28 , has already been convicted of murder , but the @entity81 courts have ruled he did not act alone .			1

@entity0 is seen writing in a journal in the backyard of her mother 's home in @entity44
her rock musician fiancé @entity3 is by her side
@entity0 's mother @entity41 was looking distraught as she went about her chores
