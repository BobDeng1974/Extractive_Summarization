by @entity0 he promised that the @entity2 would throw open its convents and monasteries as shelters , while saying that the church must be ' the first port of call ' for migrants			1
but pope @entity10 is seemingly remaining silent in the face of a group of 50 immigrant families , who have taken shelter in his favourite church in @entity17			1
around 120 migrants , including 15 children , have been occupying @entity20 , the giant basilica where @entity10 goes to seek guidance before every major endeavour , for more than a week			1
the migrants wrote to @entity10 , pictured , eight days ago asking for asylum but he has so far not replied the group , from @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 as well as @entity29 , have requested asylum from the @entity2 after being evicted from their squat in @entity31 , a district in south - eastern @entity17 by @entity33 authorities			1
a letter to the @entity10 asking for help began : ‘ @entity37 , we are men , women and children , inhabitants of @entity17 and citizens of @entity43			2
‘ we ask that you make yours the wounds that we carry , that you grant us as human beings who have been persecuted , harassed and humiliated by the @entity47 , political asylum			0
’ but after eight days they have heard nothing			2
the church which is officially @entity53 territory like all of the four great @entity55 of @entity17 shuts to parishioners and pilgrims at 8pm every night whereupon the group lay out their beds on its marble floors			1
the migrants have been staying inside @entity20 basilica , pictured , said to be one of the @entity10 's favourite churches in @entity17 they rise at 5.30am and tidy their beds away before mass at 7am			1
during the day some go to work , while others attempt to sleep in an adjoining nave , or care for children playing in the car park			0
@entity17 city council has offered the group accommodation , but they refused it because they say there is no electricity there and some of the inhabitants there have tuberculosis			2
it is not the first time the church has been occupied			0
in february anti-austerity demonstrators in the @entity84 set up camp there saying they had urgent questions for @entity10			2
@entity89 , one of the priests at the church , told @entity91 : ‘ the @entity55 is beginning to feel the weight of their presence			0
' they are good people ...			0
but unlike other churches we do n’t have another room for parishioners or a space to put them in			0
this is a holy place that at night turns into a dormitory			0
