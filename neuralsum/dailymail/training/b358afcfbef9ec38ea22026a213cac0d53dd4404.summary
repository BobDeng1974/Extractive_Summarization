something very strange is happening in our skies			2
from @entity4 to @entity5 , @entity6 all the way to @entity8 , thousands of people reported hearing a series of loud bangs in the sky around 10.30pm on saturday			1
many have described the mysterious noises as sounding like explosions or rumbles of thunder			1
others thought they were similar to sonic booms — the sound a supersonic aircraft makes when it passes through the sound barrier			2
some said the bangs sounded more like a series of loud , crackling pops and so suspected fireworks			1
however , when they looked outside , none were to be seen			2
no one , it appeared , had a clue			2
but what made matters even more puzzling was that it emerged that a loud bang had been heard in @entity47 , @entity48 — thousands of miles from @entity30 — around the same time			1
so , what on earth could it have been ? there ’s no doubt that as soon as an event like this occurs , it becomes hard to separate fact from fiction			2
though social media is brilliant at spreading information quickly , it ’s as fast at circulating incorrect stories			2
many attention - seekers falsely reported they had heard noises			1
others innocently reported similar noises they heard at the same time for which there will be perfectly ordinary explanations — such as military training or , indeed , fireworks			1
fireworks were in @entity72 ( pictured ) - but they were hardly loud enough to be heard nationwide the most persuasive of these reports was the sound recording made by @entity75 , from @entity72 , @entity76 , who said she could not see any fireworks and was therefore baffled by the noises			1
however , it emerged there was a large and very loud fireworks display for a wedding party on saturday night at the @entity84 , which is just four miles from the centre of @entity72			1
saturday was a still night and the sound would have easily carried for miles			0
but as fireworks in @entity76 are most certainly not loud enough to be heard in @entity4 , @entity88 wheels ca n’t possibly account for the nationwide reports of this seemingly other - worldly phenomenon			1
some of the explanations are positively outlandish , but we must consider them all for , as @entity95 famously observed : ‘ when you have eliminated the impossible , whatever remains , however improbable , must be the truth			0
’ the most bizarre accounts have been propagated by those who suspect the world is coming to an end			0
according to a blog called @entity104 , which seeks to chronicle ‘ the end of days ’ , the noises may signal our doom			1
‘ i believe the booms are manifestations of spiritual warfare we happen to hear on this side of the veil or the preparations @entity115 is making for imminent tribulation judgments , ’ says the blog			0
you do n’t need to be the atheist @entity118 to dismiss such an explanation , but the idea that the noises are a manifestation of divine displeasure is widely accepted by many			1
thousands melodramatically used the @entity34 hashtag — which signals a much - discussed topic — # @entity128 when they reported the bangs , though often in jest			1
other wild explanations involve aliens , as so many conspiracy theories do			0
a lack of corroborating visual evidence — such as spaceships or little green men — makes this harder to press home			0
theories : there was no shortage of ideas when it came to the possible source of the noises then there is the @entity148 theory			1
this is a widely reported low frequency noise that is said to occur in parts of @entity30 and @entity152			0
there have been different reports of the noise for at least 40 years			0
for example , in 2011 in the village of @entity158 in @entity159 , residents claimed to be hearing it for days			0
often , there are rational explanations for @entity148 , such as nearby factories or people suffering from tinnitus , but some occurrences remain genuinely mysterious			0
however , what was heard on saturday night was not a humming , but more of a series of explosions			1
one of the more believable explanations is that the noises were caused by an ultra top secret @entity175 aeroplane that uses a ‘ pulse detonation engine ’ to power it to five times the speed of sound			1
according to dr @entity179 , a scientist at @entity180 working on the technology behind these engines , the strange sounds could have been made by such a plane			0
‘ when we run a test engine it ’s a real industrial noise you can hear it for miles , ’ he says			1
no aircraft have used such engines to travel at supersonic speeds , though a persistent conspiracy theory maintains that the @entity175 have a plane called @entity195 powered by pulse detonation			1
as such theories go , @entity195 is the oldest of chestnuts — it has been around for at least a quarter of a century			0
a widespread version is that the @entity175 have secretly developed a hypersonic spy plane to replace the defunct @entity203 spy plane , and that it flies around the world on clandestine missions			0
of course , this conveniently ignores the fact that with increasingly sophisticated satellites , there is little or no need for the @entity175 to develop fearsomely fast — and expensive — manned aircraft			0
it seems more plausible that @entity195 was simply the name given to the project that developed @entity152 ’s range of stealth aircraft , such as the b - 2 bomber			1
and even if there was such an aircraft , it is highly unlikely it would have been heard the length and breadth of @entity30 on saturday night			2
could it be ? an artist 's image of the so - called @entity195 project			2
enthusiasts say one possible power source is a ' pulse detonation engine ' , whose sound is said to resemble that caught on an audio clip on saturday theory : @entity195 is rumoured to be a top secret aircraft in development since 1989			1
last year @entity236 announced it was developing a similar sr - 72 spy plane ( illustrated ) said to be able to accelerate up to @entity238 after all , there seems little point in developing an aeroplane quite so absurdly noisy			2
some suggested weather conditions , such as thunder , might be the source , but the @entity246 dismissed this			0
another suggestion made by people pointing out that @entity30 has a severe terror warning in place is that the bizarre bangs were controlled explosions carried out by the police			0
but this is highly unlikely			0
so , if is not secret planes , fireworks , @entity115 , the police or aliens , then what is the only possible explanation left ? the most plausible answer is simple and , surprisingly , has barely been considered			1
the noises heard are likely to have been caused by a massive meteor entering the atmosphere above @entity30			1
though we think of meteors as visual phenomenon , they do , in fact , make a noise — and the larger the meteor , the bigger the sound			0
compare the reports over the weekend to the eyewitness testimonies given in the @entity276 in december 1795 when a 56lb meteorite hit the ground near the village of @entity280			0
a @entity282 engine works by using force from a series of explosions , caused by mixing a fuel mist and air intake , to thrust itself forward			2
its contrails appear to look like ' rings on a rope ' ( pictured ) , or a spine ‘ i heard noises in the air like the report of cannon at a distance , ’ said mr @entity294			1
an 11 - year - old boy called @entity301 also heard the sound , which he described as being like ‘ the noise as of firing of cannon , heard at the above time a hissing in the air ’			1
many local inhabitants thought the repeated noises were ‘ guns at sea ’			1
witnesses of other meteorite falls over the centuries have recorded hearing similar sounds			0
‘ a noise like thunder or the rolling of drums broke overhead , followed by a whizzing noise or the sound of escaping steam , ’ said one			0
all these reports from over the years sound extremely similar to those recounted over the weekend			0
dr @entity326 , the curator of meteorites at @entity76 ’s @entity328 , agrees that the sound may have been made by a fireball — a meteor burning up as it hits the atmosphere			2
one possible explanation is that the loud noise and ground shaking could have been a meteorite breaking up in the atmosphere , which would result in a sonic boom - a claim backed by expert dr @entity326 ‘ from what i ’ve seen , it could be the noise effects from a fireball , ’ she says			1
‘ you certainly get a series of explosions and it is possible this occurred over @entity30 on saturday			0
’ what this does not explain is how the noise could be heard in the @entity175 the most rational explanation is that what was heard in @entity354 was something else — perhaps the sonic boom from an aircraft — and its timing was coincidental			2
if the noises were made by a meteor and it landed in the @entity30 , then somewhere there is going to be a very big crater			2
however , it is more likely that whatever made the noise landed with a big splash and its secrets are at the bottom of the sea			0
for those who do n’t believe it was a meteor — and it does seem strange no airline pilots have reported any bright lights as they flew above the cloud cover — there can only be one explanation left			0
it was @entity379 on a practice run .			0

noises were heard from @entity6 to @entity72 , from @entity5 to @entity8
loud , crackling pops sounded like fireworks - but none were to be seen
guns , jets , meteorites , fireworks or *fantasists* all could be to blame
one expert said it could be ' pulse detonation engine ' from top - secret jet
