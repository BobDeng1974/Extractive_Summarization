the future looks bright for @entity1 , or at least brighter now that @entity2 has released a new map with all the friends connected through the site across the world represented by shining points of light			1
countries worldwide are bathed in blue on the striking map , and far more users are represented than were on a similar map released in 2010			2
the map shows the rising popularity of the social media site in @entity17 , @entity18 , and @entity19			1
but it has one undeniably black hole : it sits directly over the nation of @entity23			0
september 2013 : @entity2 has proudly made this map his @entity1 page 's new cover photo			0
it shows how all the world is connected through the social media behemoth december 2010 : an older map , while impressive , proves just how much @entity1 's reach has spread			2
notice a darker @entity17 , @entity18 , and @entity19			1
@entity23 , where @entity1 is blocked , is a black hole on the new and old maps blue planet : according to @entity1 , over a billion users logged on to the social media site each month in 2013 , up 23 percent from 2012 as noted by @entity38 , the @entity37 is no big fan of @entity1			1
the communist government has blocked @entity1 for years — blaming it , at least in part , on the riots in @entity43 that left 140 dead in 2009 — along with @entity44 , @entity45 , and other sites			0
instead of @entity1 , @entity23 internet users interested in social media log onto the sites @entity50 , @entity51 , and @entity52			1
also a dark spot , on both the new and old @entity1 connection maps , is the @entity17			1
@entity17 ’s more populous coastal and southern regions are alight , but no connections are leaping out of the continent ’s center			0
telecom infrastructure here is far less developed , though tech giants like @entity1 and @entity63 are working to change that			0
@entity65 is another dark area on the map , though that ’s owed less to a restrictive government and more to its citizen ’s preferences			0
@entity1 is only the second most used social network in @entity65 after the more popular @entity73			0
while the darker areas of @entity1 ’s maps have remained relatively unchanged , many of the brighter spots have become even more so			0
the booming economy of @entity19 has no doubt fueled its increased connections on @entity1			1
@entity81 , another rapidly industrializing country , has also increased its @entity1 use , despite the longstanding popularity of @entity63 ’s @entity84 in the @entity18 nation			2
while @entity1 may not be breaking into the @entity23 market , just a glance at these maps makes it clear that the site ’s popularity is on the rise worldwide and wo n’t be going away any time soon .			2

a map using points of blue light to show how @entity1 connections across the globe shows a jump in users in @entity19 , @entity17 , and @entity18
but @entity23 , where @entity1 has been *banned* for years , remains in the dark
