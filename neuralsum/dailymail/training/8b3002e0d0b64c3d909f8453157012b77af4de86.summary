according to the most recent figures , one million @entity0 claim to have gotten a tattoo during a late night drinking session			2
but for one man , the consequences proved particularly severe			2
not only did @entity7 , a father - of - five from @entity9 lose his job , his facial tattoos have also resulted in social ostracism and his children being picked on at school			1
so desperate to get rid of them did the 35 - year - old become , he even resorted to trying to scratch them off using a cheese grater			1
' i find it hard to get a job of any kind and as for paid work , i have n't had any in five years			1
' interviewers say " i do n't think you 'd be quite right for this position " and i know it 's because of my face			2
' @entity7 's ordeal began following a drunken party			1
after the discussion moved to inkings , a friend boasted he could make a tattoo gun			1
much to everyone 's surprise , he did			2
' he got a little motor , some biros and this welding thing and he came back an hour later with this machine , ' remembers @entity7			1
' i thought : " this is pretty cool ! " he did n't have any ink so someone went and got a printer cartridge and we all thought : well this will do ! it was nuts ! ' unemployed : since getting the tattoos , the @entity9 father - of - five has been unable to find a job difference : @entity7 wishes he had kept his face tattoo - free and says people judge him for his tattoos the next morning , much to his horror , he woke up to find three wobbly tears etched into his cheeks with jet black ink			1
' when i sobered up i looked in the mirror and thought : who are you ? what the @entity71 have you done to yourself ? you look like an idiot , ' he remembers			0
' it looks like an alien sneezed on my face			0
' worse was to come			0
on his first day back at work after getting the tattoo , his bosses called him into the office and gave him the sack			0
' the first day i went back in after having the tattoo , they said : sorry , you ca n't work here			0
bye - bye , see you later			2
' but almost as bad was the daily abuse he began to receive and the social ostracism that followed			0
' when i 'm out and about in town , i get stared at pretty much 24/7 , ' he says			0
' old ladies cross the street and clutch their handbags like i 'm going to nick something of theirs			0
' i 've been called @entity104 , a murderer ... i think people think i 'm some kind of psychotic clown gangster sort of thing			0
' @entity7 has also had to watch his children be bullied at school as a result of his inkings			1
' it makes me feel guilty all the time , ' he admits			0
' knowing they 're suffering because of something i did			0
' desperate to remove the inkings but unable to afford laser treatment , @entity7 hit rock bottom and decided to take drastic action			1
' i 've got a nutmeg grater and i 've been trying to grate them off my face , ' he reveals			2

awareness : @entity7 , who appears on @entity126 with @entity127 , hopes others wo n't repeat his mistake brighter future : @entity7 , who is now having laser treatment , tried to get rid of his tattoos using a cheese grater ' i grated them quite a lot and i thought , " oh , it 's coming out " because blood was coming but i woke up the next day and they were still there - with scabs too			1
' @entity7 , who has now begun laser treatment to remove the etchings , says he would tell anyone thinking of getting a facial inking not to have it done			1
' bascially , i 've regretted it since the day i got it done , ' he says			0
' people think they can call you every name under the sun. ' what affects me most is people 's preconceptions of who i am			0
