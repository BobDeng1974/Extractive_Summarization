passengers on a @entity2 holiday have complained they were effectively asked to ‘ pay the crew ’s wages ’ after being urged to tip £ 8 a day			1
travellers on the ‘ all - inclusive ’ tour of the @entity8 islands were allegedly told by a guide that the gratuity was the company ’s ‘ own recommendations ’ which would be shared among the ship ’s crew of seven			1
but with 30 passengers on board for the eight - day cruise , they calculated this worked out as £ 274 per crew member			1
‘ the general conclusion was that @entity2 was not paying the crew ’s wages , but was asking the passengers to pay them instead			1
’ the seven - night holiday , which costs up to £ 1,250 per person , is advertised as including travel insurance , return flights and transfers , full board , local wines , beers and soft drinks with lunch and dinner throughout the cruise , excursions and a free bar open 11 hours a day			1
the tour includes the @entity45 of @entity46 and @entity47 , national park of @entity49 and the islands of @entity51 and @entity52			0
@entity53 said customers are told to ‘ use their own discretion ’ on how much to tip. a spokesman for the firm said : ‘ we pay the commercial market rate for chartering the ships on these holidays			1
in the light of this complaint , we will be reminding the ship owners of our policies regarding gratuities			0
’ the payment of tips on cruises is a long - running issue between some cruise companies and their customers			2
many tour operators that are not all inclusive automatically add tips from adult guests to bills , typically of around £ 3 - £ 6 a day			2
in most cases the amount can be altered or completely removed if requested			0
however , some cruise lines send passengers a letter to their cabin asking them to reconsider if they ask to have the tips taken off the bill			0
the holiday tour visited @entity45 such as @entity46 ( pictured ) and @entity47 in @entity87 crew on some liners are said to compile a list of people who have removed their gratuities – nicknamed the ‘ spit - list ’ – which is posted in staff communal areas			1
costa holidays automatically add a fixed service charge of £ 5.50 per person per day to bills and 15 per cent on drinks bills for all guests over 14			0
those aged between four and 14 are charged half that amount			0
the company warns : ‘ the service charge is used by the company to incentivise staff who perform hotel duties and to continually improve the quality of service offered on board @entity110 ships			0
‘ the service charge is an integral part of the total price of the cruise and therefore the amount can not be altered			0
’ crews on @entity118 - based cruise companies have been known to express disappointment when asked to join cruises leaving the @entity121 because @entity121 are believed to be worse tippers than @entity118 .			2
