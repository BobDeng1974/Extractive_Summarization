affluent and attractive , @entity0 has been ranked the best place for a golden retirement			1
in fact , it is one of a string of areas in the west of @entity10 that top a league table of ‘ grey hotspots ’			1
but there is one notable exception to the catalogue of picturesque or coastal destinations			1
second place in the list was the comfortable if unglamorous @entity20 ’ town of @entity21			1
@entity0 has long scored strongly in official records for its high life expectancy , good health , and general affluence			0
above , the county 's fabulously expensive seaside mansion suburb of @entity31 , in @entity32 second place in the list was the comfortable but rather unglamorous @entity35 suburb of @entity21 the table , compiled by analysts at the @entity38 , reflects levels of home ownership , health , the number of unpaid carers who help relatives , the numbers of pension - age people who are married , and , as a measure of the ability of local retired people to enjoy travel , the number of pensioners who hold passports			1
many of the top 10 destinations are coastal or highly picturesque areas which have long attracted those able to afford to move after retirement to the most attractive parts of the country			1
they include the coastal districts of the @entity63 , @entity64 ; the county of @entity66 and the @entity68 town of @entity32 ; @entity69 , which includes the @entity70 and the @entity71 ; and @entity72 , which lies between the @entity73 and the @entity74			1
the @entity76 district includes @entity77 and a coastline comparable to @entity79 ; @entity64 includes the resort of @entity81 ; and @entity66 has both popular coastal resorts and attractive country towns			2
@entity32 includes the fabulously expensive seaside mansion suburb of @entity31			2
@entity21 , on the other hand , offers a @entity87 factory , most of @entity35 airport , and easy access to the @entity90			1
the area is , however , long established as a well - off suburb with good schools and high house prices , and its strength as a retirement zone may have come about because its residents are reluctant to move out when they leave their jobs			2
@entity99 of @entity38 said : ‘ our analysis clearly shows that the quality of life experienced by retirees varies significantly across the country			0
‘ however , it is not always possible for people to up sticks and move to a location they consider to be more desirable , when the time comes to give up work			0
' family ties and the cost of moving home often dictate where people find themselves living as pensioners			0
’ the @entity118 was produced by examining statistics on 170 local authority areas with the largest numbers of retirees			2

@entity21 scored 44 points , with more than eight out of 10 pensioners owning their homes and nearly as many holding passports , while more than half are in good health and nearly half are married rather than single , divorced or widowed			1
more than one in eight of its population provide unpaid care to children , a spouse , a partner or to a relative or a friend			0
@entity68 towns and villages are a favoured destination for people retiring from jobs in major cities			0
the town of @entity159 has the highest number of married people in the country ; the @entity38 last year named @entity163 as the town with the highest concentration of pensioners in its population ; and in @entity68 one in 10 of the population are likely to be aged over 85 in less than 20 years ’ time			2
the report said : ‘ @entity0 was found to provide retirees with the best quality of life			0
@entity68 has one of the highest retirement populations in the country			0
’ mr @entity99 said : ‘ people looking to secure a retirement in an area where the quality of life is already high , or those simply looking to be as financially comfortable as possible when they give up work , are well advised to follow the simple rule of saving as much as possible as early as possible in their working lives			0
