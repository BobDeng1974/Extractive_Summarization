' they can even move out of the way if someone walks near them and be programmed to follow you around so you ’re never in darkness			0
the toro - bots were built by @entity17 - based artist @entity16 and are made using @entity19 quadrupeds fitted with @entity21 - style lights			1
the toro - bots , pictured , were built by @entity17 - based professor @entity16			1
he fitted @entity21 - style lanterns to the top of @entity19 quadrupeds			1
these lamps can be controlled collectively , or individually , using an @entity27			1
they walk , flash their lights and can be made to ' dance ' the quadrupeds used in @entity33 ’s robots were made by @entity35 - based @entity34 and cost $ 949.95 ( £ 568 ) each			1
each of @entity33 's lamps have a ‘ personality ’ and can sense their surroundings using infrared rangefinders			0
they then communicate with a central computer using an @entity43 network , which can be controlled by an @entity27 , or other wireless network			0
the lamps are also fitted with infrared blinking leds and a @entity48 camera that can scan the garden and be used to track the robots			0
the lamps can be controlled collectively , or individually , using an @entity27 and they were designed for a ‘ generative garden ’ exhibition at the @entity52 in @entity17 : @entity54			1
@entity16 said : ‘ a traditional @entity21 garden strives to represent a miniature natural landscape			2
' following clear aesthetic principles , a @entity21 garden is designed to recreate the eyes and foster contemplation and meditation			2
‘ we propose a garden that takes care of itself , that somehow understands and reinterprets the rules of harmony and equilibrium , and reconfigures itself depending on the season , and the presence or absence of a human observers			0
