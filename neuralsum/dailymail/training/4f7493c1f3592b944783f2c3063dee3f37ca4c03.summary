commuters faced chaotic scenes while getting to work in @entity2 this morning - with two - thirds of buses in @entity2 not running because of a strike			1
passengers had been warned that their journeys would be ' significantly disrupted ' because of a walkout by thousands of members of the @entity11 union			1
the strike came despite the fact that only 16 per cent of drivers in the capital voted for the industrial action over pay			1
some 24million journeys are made across the @entity20 network daily - and almost 90 per cent of adult fare paying passengers used public transport today			1
the lack of buses meant that the @entity26 and train network in the capital had to cope with an estimated two million extra journeys today			2
the average total jam length during the peak hour in @entity2 is 501 miles			1
the worst congestion was on the @entity57 in @entity58 heading towards @entity2			1
on that stretch of road - which links the capital to @entity63 in @entity64 - there was stationary traffic for 15 miles causing two hours of delays			2
around a third of buses ran during the morning rush and passengers were urged to check before they travelled			2
there are around 46million bus journeys made in @entity2 on an average week , with some 6.5million bus journeys taken in the capital every day and it was revealed in 2013 that the number of journeys by @entity2 bus had increased from 1.4billion to 2.3billion - 64 per cent - in the past 13 years			1
trying to make it to work : commuters queue at @entity34 as they wait to enter the @entity26 during a one - day strike by bus drivers making their way on foot : commuters walk across @entity86 during a one day strike by bus drivers in the capital empty bus lanes : passengers at @entity34 and elsewhere have been warned that their journeys will be ' significantly disrupted ' today @entity93 , @entity20 's director of buses , said : ' i am very sorry that the leadership of @entity11 have chosen to disrupt the journeys of bus passengers , especially given that only 16 per cent of the bus drivers voted for strike action			1
' as the bus companies who employ the drivers have said , it makes no sense to pay all drivers precisely the same amount			2
' as in all professions , bus drivers have different skills and experience and it is only right that this can be reflected in pay			2
' if all drivers are paid the average then , by definition , half of all bus drivers will need to take a pay cut			2
' any ' levelling up ' of pay to the highest rates would lead to a cut in bus services , an increase in fares , or both			0
' @entity2 has one of the best and most extensive bus networks anywhere in the world			1
' it would be much better if the leadership of @entity11 actually worked with the bus companies to ensure that it remains that way rather than disrupting bus passengers			2
' @entity11 said there was a difference of around Â£ 3 an hour in pay rates in @entity2 bus companies			1
the union is campaigning for a single rate			0
@entity11 reported solid support for the strike and said picket lines had been mounted outside bus depots across the capital			2
busy : commuters struggled to get to work from @entity34 today as bus drivers held a 24 - hour strike calling for better pay conditions struggling to get on a train : around a third of buses ran during the morning rush and passengers were urged to check before they travelled strike lasting 24 hours : @entity156 bus drivers were all smiles as they picketed outside @entity159 bus depot in north - west @entity2 official picket line : members of @entity11 at @entity163 's @entity162 in south - west @entity2 go on strike @entity165 , @entity166 's transport spokesman on the @entity167 , said : ' today 's dispute is regrettable , but not surprising given the fact that @entity2 's bus operating companies treat drivers so unfairly			1
author @entity173 said on @entity174 from @entity175 : ' did everyone just decide to drive this morning in @entity2 because of the bus strike ? ugh			1
two hours and i 'm still not at my office			0
' and a @entity182 user named ' @entity183 ' said : ' in nearly two hours i made it to @entity185			0
which is 1/6 of my total journey # @entity187			0
' meanwhile fashion pr worker @entity189 , from west @entity2 , tweeted : ' my usual 30 minute journey to work has taken almost two hours today			1
' and mother @entity192 said : ' not impressed - my daughters had to leave at 7am and walk to school - it 's an hour 's walk and walk home again later x # @entity187			0
' ' the mayor has washed his hands of responsibility for @entity2 's bus drivers , but it is not just a matter of fairness that he should take some responsibility for resolving this dispute			1
' @entity2 's passengers will get a better service from transport staff who are treated fairly			1
' the mayor raises questions about the validity of strike ballots , but this strike had 84 % of @entity11 members voting in support			1
' @entity2 's bus drivers are not militant			1
in fact , this is only the second @entity2 - wide bus strike in 50 years			1
' the assembly 's conservative transport spokesman @entity217 said : ' this sort of strike action , designed to bring @entity2 to a standstill , is archaic and belongs in the past			1
' withdrawing services will only hurt commuters and businesses			0
' a better solution would be @entity228 - style mediation from an independent judge between employees and their private companies			0
' in this case , it 's a fact of life that people doing similar jobs for different companies get different amounts of pay , so the call for standard wages across the board seems unrealistic			0
' a petition has been started to allow licensed minicabs access to bus lanes during transport strikes			0
minicab comparison and booking app @entity247 said it will submit the petition to @entity20			2
chief executive @entity252 said : ' today 's bus strike will cause millions of @entity255 problems getting to work , or any other destination , which will have a detrimental knock - on effect on commerce			2
help : @entity11 reported solid support for the strike and said picket lines had been mounted outside bus depots across the capital getting in line : passengers queue for the 507 bus today , which runs from @entity268 to @entity269 different modes of transport : cyclists and a motorcyclist travel along along @entity274 during a bus strike in @entity2 today a former chief of naval staff has called for greater use of the @entity278 to ease congestion on @entity2 's roads and railways			1
@entity166 ex-minister @entity282 said increased use of the river would ' take a lot of weight off the railway system and the roads '			0
his comments came after passenger chaos due to over-running engineering works at @entity292 over the @entity294 break and problems at @entity86			0
transport minister @entity296 agreed at question time the @entity278 offered ' exciting opportunities '			0
but because it ' winds and bends around loops ' journeys could be ' fairly slow '			2
independent crossbencher @entity304 said the ' fiasco ' at @entity86 and the ' chaos ' at @entity308 were good reasons to ' renationalise everything to do with our railways '			0
@entity296 said quite a number of the problems that had occurred were down to @entity315 ' the one part of the system that we actually do directly own '			0
she said the problems highlighted were ' inexcusable ' and must be dealt with			0
liberal democrat @entity320 said there had been ' tremendous under - investment ' for decades in the rail network			0
' it pinpoints the imperative of getting @entity326 working ... to relieve the congestion , ' he added			0
@entity296 told him : ' i agree with everything you 've just said			0
' but @entity166 spokesman @entity331 of @entity332 added , to laughter : ' well , i do n't			0
' lord @entity331 asked how frequently ministers met with @entity315 planners when ' crunch ' works were approaching , adding : ' ministers should realise the buck stops with them			0
' @entity296 said there were frequent meetings			0
' there are many lessons to be learned from the experiences of the last couple of weeks , which have been inexcusable			0
' ' a simple solution that would help keep @entity2 moving , is to grant access to @entity2 's licensed minicabs during public transport strikes , but it 's a solution that @entity20 is just not willing to consider			1
' @entity11 said around 20,000 of its members had joined the strike , with picket lines mounted at 70 bus depots across @entity2			1
a spokesman said : ' rather than quoting misleading figures about turnouts in the ballots , @entity20 and the mayor need to look at the streets of @entity2 today and recognise the depth of anger felt by bus workers			1
' they need to bang the bus companies ' heads together and get them to allow collective bargaining			0

passengers are warned that journeys will be ' significantly disrupted ' because of walkout by thousands of drivers
@entity20 officials say they are ' very sorry ' that strike action has gone ahead given that only 16 % of drivers voted for it
