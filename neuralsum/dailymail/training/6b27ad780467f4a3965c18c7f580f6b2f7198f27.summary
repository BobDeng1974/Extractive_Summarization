the officials also said @entity1 said he should be ' trusted ' on the issue and about the unwillingness of @entity23 to enter into and follow through on cease - fire talks			2
on a phone call with the @entity13 ambassador friday , shortly after a cease fire was broken , he vented his anger and said he expects @entity13 support on how he chooses to deal with @entity23 the @entity17 administration on friday condemned ' outrageous ' violations of an internationally brokered @entity9 cease - fire by @entity6 militants and called the apparent abduction of an @entity2 soldier a ' barbaric ' action			1
the strong reaction came as top @entity2 officials questioned the effort to forge the truce , accusing the @entity13 and the @entity46 of being naive in assuming the radical @entity23 movement would adhere with its terms			1
the officials also blamed the @entity51 state of @entity52 for not forcing the militants to comply			0
with the cease - fire in tatters fewer than two hours after it took effect with an attack that killed two @entity2 troops and left a third missing , president @entity17 demanded that those responsible release the soldier			0
@entity17 and other @entity13 officials did not directly blame @entity23 for the abduction			2
but they made clear they hold @entity23 responsible for , or having influence over , the actions of all factions in the @entity9			2
the language was a distinct change from thursday when @entity72 was focused on the deaths of @entity6 civilians			0
' if they are serious about trying to resolve this situation , that soldier needs to be unconditionally released as soon as possible , ' @entity17 told reporters			0
president @entity17 spoke on friday afternoon , in part about he @entity80			0
his administration condemned ' outrageous ' violations of an internationally brokered @entity9 cease - fire by @entity6 militants and called the apparent abduction of an @entity2 soldier a ' barbaric ' action he added that it would be difficult to revive the cease - fire without the captive 's release			1
' it 's going to be very hard to put a cease - fire back together again if @entity2 and the international community ca n't feel confident that @entity23 can follow through on a cease - fire commitment , ' he said			1
his comment reflected uncertainty in the @entity13 and elsewhere that @entity23 was actually responsible for the incident or if some other militant group was to blame			2
at the same time , @entity17 called the situation in @entity9 ' heartbreaking ' and repeated calls for @entity2 to do more to prevent @entity6 civilian casualties			0

@entity14 negotiated the truce with @entity46 chief @entity112 in a marathon session of phone calls over several days while he was in @entity115 on an official visit			0
@entity14 had spent much of the past two weeks in @entity117 , @entity2 , the @entity118 and @entity119 trying to mediate a cease - fire with @entity52 and @entity121 playing a major role because of their close ties with @entity23			0
a @entity6 supporter of @entity23 holds the quran as others shout slogans against the @entity2 military action in @entity9 , during a demonstration in the @entity118 town of @entity132 on friday those efforts failed with @entity2 saying it could not trust @entity23 and some @entity2 and @entity13 pro-israel groups complaining that the @entity13 was treating the group — a foreign terrorist organization as designated by the @entity138 — as a friend			1
late thursday , however , @entity2 accepted @entity14 and @entity112 's latest proposal , despite its reservations			0
once the truce was violated , though , @entity2 officials hit out at not only @entity23 , but the @entity13 and @entity52 for its failure			1
an @entity2 official said the @entity1 government viewed both @entity23 and @entity52 as having violated the commitment given to the @entity13 and the @entity46 and that it expected the international community to take practical steps as part of a ' strong and swift response , ' especially regarding the return of the abducted soldier			1

@entity1 told @entity156 the @entity17 administration was ' not to ever second - guess me again ' and that @entity72 should trust his judgment on how to deal with @entity23 , according to the people			1
@entity1 added that he now ' expected ' the @entity13 and other countries to fully support @entity2 's offensive in @entity9 , according to those familiar with the call			1
they spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter by name			0
they said @entity1 made similar points to @entity14 , who himself denounced the attack as ' outrageous , ' saying it was an affront to assurances to respect the cease - fire given to the @entity13 and @entity46 , which brokered the truce .			2
