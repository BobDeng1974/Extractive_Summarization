by @entity0 published : 10:53 est , 2 september 2012 updated : 11:02 est , 2 september 2012 the daddy of all @entity3 games is back			1
and now , thanks to loads of improvements , you ’ll be able to feel the passion , speed and glory of the world ’s most glamorous sport like never before			1
yes , it ’s @entity14 , which developers say is the most accessible and immersive @entity14 game out there			1
and , as an @entity14 ‘ noob ’ , i ’d have to agree			1
@entity3 fun : yet again , the @entity3 game is shaping up to be a classic this is largely due to the ingenious @entity24			1
here , @entity3 novices are taught the basics of the sport through tutorials , and learn how to get the best from their cars			1
this even includes how to use the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) and the @entity33 ( @entity33 )			2
when you ’re ready , you can test out your moves in a variety of different game modes			0
these include @entity40 mode – where you ’re thrown straight into the action against one of six world champions ( @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 ) to try and beat them and become the ultimate champion			1
then there ’s the @entity52 , where you take part in ten races			1
you start as a low - ranking team and select a rival driver you think you can beat			0
as you beat him over a series of races , you will win their seat in the better car – eventually working your way through the field to become champion			1
of course , if you ’re still not up to the challenge , @entity14 features all - new lap walk - throughs from @entity3 test driver @entity69			1
@entity69 will talk the player through a lap of each of the 20 circuits on the 2012 calendar , highlighting braking points , gearing and giving expert technical advice which will help players find extra speed on every lap. there have been the usual graphical upgrades , too			0
one massive improvement is the localised weather system			2
this results in sudden weather changes in different parts of the track			2
breathtaking : the attention to detail really is something to behold when one part of the track is wet while other areas are dry , the race will become more unpredictable and you ’ll have to make game - changing strategy calls			2
' the whole weather scenario system has really been refined this year , ” said @entity100 , game director			2
' you ’ll get weather fronts come in now and then and it could be raining at one section of the track but dry on another			2
' you get those moments where you ’re not sure which tyres to be on and that really mixes up the racing			0
' the general look has improved , too			0
the @entity112 engine has been tweaked so graphics seem sharper this time around			0
the attention to detail is fantastic , with dynamic lighting shining off the cars			0
handling , however , does take some getting used to – no matter what difficulty you ’re on , is hard to manage			0
but it ’s incredibly rewarding when you get it right , and there are useful speed / break markers which help keep you on course			0
' significant work has gone into the physics model , particularly the suspension , which has a real change on the feel of the car , ’ said @entity133 , creative director			1
' you can really attack the track			0
it ’s those extra elements that make you feel like a real @entity14 driver			1
’ and for those after authenticity , then look no further			0
photorealistic : squint your eyes and you 'll feel that you 're watching a race on tv all twelve teams and twenty - four drivers competing in the 2012 season will feature , and the brand - new , incomplete @entity150 in @entity151 , @entity152 — is included in the championship			1
drivers , start your engines			0
it ’s due out september 21			0
