it sounds like the storyline for an episode of the @entity3 – tearaway @entity4 goes metal detecting and causes chaos when he brings home an unexploded bomb			1
but that is just what his namesake did when he went hunting for treasure near his home			0
@entity4 , 37 , unwittingly came across the second world war relic encased in mud in while metal detecting in woodland in @entity18			1
he said : ' i did n’t know how they would react to a guy phoning to say " hi , i ’m @entity4 and i ’ve found an explosive "			1
' the funny thing is i ’m not even a fan of @entity3			0
' police evacuated mr @entity4 's neighbours in @entity37 at 11pm on sunday and an @entity39 bomb disposal unit was called in			1
he said : ‘ i do n’t think my neighbours were very impressed about being asked to leave their homes on the coldest night of the year			2
still , it was the safest thing to do			0
' mr @entity4 said he had n't realised the object was a bomb , saying : ' i had just put it in my bag and it was n’t until i began cleaning the things i had found that i realised what it was			1
mr @entity4 said he had n't realised the object was a bomb and put it in a bucket of water outside his house , saying : ' i had just put it in my bag and it was n’t until i began cleaning the things i had found that i realised what it was ' ‘ i put it in a bucket of water outside my house and called the police			1
' mr @entity4 said had he known the object was a bomb he would have simply ' marked the spot ' and called the police			1

‘ it ’s the first time i have ever found anything like this			0
usually it ’s coins and other items			0
’ an @entity39 spokesman said the bomb ' still contained explosives '			2
the spokesman added : ‘ destroying the shell was the safest thing to do in the circumstances , as old ammunition can be quite unstable			0
