by @entity0 follow @ @ neilashton _ before every training session , @entity1 reminded his players that @entity4 was n't a fan of @entity6 and their football			1
@entity9 's manager had them down as a primitive @entity11 team who would rely on ' long balls and long throws - ins '			1
he called it wrong , catastrophically so			0
after this extraordinary comeback by @entity6 , recovering from 3 - 0 down to draw 3 - 3 , @entity4 must play the long game			1
centre of attention : @entity4 oversees his side 's dramatic draw at @entity6 on monday night @entity9 's manager has accepted that their chances of winning the title are over			1
well done @entity25 and good luck , he said			0
truth be told @entity4 under - estimated @entity6 and this incredible match will surely be remembered as the night when @entity9 blew the title			1
when @entity30 scored @entity6 's third goal , there is no stadium in the country that has experienced a noise level like it this season			2
the corrugated iron roofs of the @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 at @entity41 nearly flew into the night sky			0
@entity4 , standing on the edge of the technical area , turned to his assistant , @entity45			0
they knew , as everybody else knows , they could not win the @entity11 title from there			1
@entity4 ' team , including the newly crowned @entity52 , @entity53 , have been left shredded			2
they have nothing left to give			0
@entity30 , who also scored in @entity6 's defeat at @entity9 in october , has barely been able to get a game this season and yet he scored two remarkable goals			1
what a night for him			0
on target : @entity30 levels for the hosts on a stunning night of drama at @entity6 inconsolable : @entity64 comforts @entity53 a point still sent @entity4 's team top of the table , but it will mean nothing to them after what was a catastrophic capitulation			1
if this was @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 or @entity25 , we would be talking about whether the manager was the right man for the job			0
that 's what the @entity11 does , it chews managers up and spits them out			2
at this level , with a title to play for , you ca n't surrender and get away with it			0
fortunately , @entity4 has enough credit in the bank to go forward next season			0
@entity4 has paid for his inexperience after his side lost a critical game against @entity73 at @entity91 last week and tossed away a three - goal lead			1
how did they manage to do it ? maybe we will never know			0
but @entity9 's title challenge all came so suddenly for @entity4 , way ahead of schedule after spending his first season in charge of @entity9 figuring it all out			1
season two has been an extraordinary journey and yet now it has suddenly hit the buffers			0
game over : surely @entity9 's dreams of winning the @entity11 title ended on monday night @entity109 football next season will be a gamechanger for this club , however , and @entity4 is already making noises about signing five or six players to cope with the group phase before the turn of the year			1
@entity9 will , therefore , operate with a swollen squad and , juggling that will in itself be another test of this manager 's ability			2
just look how it turned out for @entity123 at @entity74 , where every member of the squad expected to play			0
everyone wants to play @entity109 football , but the bar is high and the standard is on another level			0
they have to live with that and somehow fight it out for a place in the top four again next season			0
suddenly the task feels enormous			0
end of the road : @entity4 conceded the title to rivals @entity25 after @entity9 's 3 - 3 draw at @entity6 in support : @entity1 has performed a minor miracle since taking over at @entity6 @entity4 will be ready , steadying himself after his trip to the @entity142 in the summer to scout for the players he needs			1
in a few weeks he will be in @entity144 and it will give the @entity9 manager a chance to reflect on the events of the final games of a @entity11 season			1
they are a massive test of nerve , something @entity4 has never experienced before as a @entity11 manager			2
he spoke of giving this title chase away , his players attempting to play ' @entity158 ' in an attempt to pulverise @entity6			2
they were 3 - 0 up at the time and suddenly , bafflingly , they were back level at 3 - 3			1
after this , @entity4 will look to the long term .			2

@entity9 drew 3 - 3 with @entity6 despite @entity4 ' side leading 3 - 0
@entity4 had branded @entity1 ' side as a team who would rely on ' long balls and long throws - ins '
result all but ended @entity9 's @entity11 title dreams
