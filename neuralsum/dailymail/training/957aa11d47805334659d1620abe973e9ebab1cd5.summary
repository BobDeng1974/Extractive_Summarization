@entity0 go to the @entity2 hunting for three points as they take on @entity6 's dishevelled @entity5 champions			2
here , @entity8 's @entity7 gives his take on where the game could be won and lost			0
@entity13 v @entity11 i ’ll be covering the game for @entity16 and this is the battle i am most looking forward to watching			1
it ’s an all - @entity18 affair and whoever comes out on top will probably end up on the winning side			1
@entity22 has had two quiet games – @entity24 and @entity25 were very physical and frustrated him			0
@entity11 will offer that but will want to take him the other way - he ’s one of the best raiding right backs we ’ve seen in the @entity5			2
this will be a brilliant contest and absolutely key in deciding the game			0
@entity11 ( left ) and @entity13 ( right - @entity34 centre ) will do battle on sunday afternoon @entity36 @entity22 has lit up the @entity5 since moving to @entity0 from @entity37 fellow countryman @entity11 ( left ) is one of the division 's toughest customers at full back @entity44 v @entity42 / @entity41 that goal against @entity46 will give @entity47 confidence and he got good opportunities against one of the meanest defences in the league			1
he still has a lot to offer but if he gets involved in a physical battle with @entity56 , there will be only one winner			0
@entity47 needs to target @entity42 / @entity41 instead because that ’s where he ’ll get his success			0
@entity44 's last - gasp equaliser against @entity46 will give him the confidence to kick on @entity41 has endured a tricky start to life in @entity65 after the defender 's summer move from @entity68 @entity6 may opt for @entity42 ( right ) instead of the struggling @entity41 at the back @entity72 v @entity70 @entity6 may go with one up front to get more numbers in midfield , but if that one is @entity72 , @entity0 are in for a tough afternoon			1
@entity72 played alone at @entity77 last season and as the lone striker against @entity80 two weeks ago he was sensational			2
@entity0 need to get numbers around him because he preys on weak links			0
@entity70 had one of his best ever games for @entity0 against @entity46 last week			1
he ’ll need another one on sunday			0
@entity72 celebrates scoring for @entity86 as they thumped @entity0 at the @entity2 last season @entity70 ( pictured being fouled by @entity88 ) could be in for a real examining by @entity72 at the @entity2			1

@entity13 is set to be *marked* by fellow @entity18 @entity11
@entity44 will be *buoyed* by his goal against @entity46
