by @entity0 published : 06:57 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 14:41 est , 27 september 2013 when @entity2 finished tending to the cabbages on her allotment one afternoon in 1972 , she was distressed to find her beloved wedding ring had slipped off her finger and tumbled into the plot			1
she and her husband @entity8 desperately scoured the muddy area of @entity10 , south @entity11 , for days , eventually giving up and replacing the nine - carat gold band			1
so @entity2 , 62 , now has two wedding rings , thanks to a local amateur treasure hunter who this week found the lost one while searching for medieval coins using a metal detector and returned it to its original owner 41 years after it was misplaced			1
buried treasure : @entity2 her husband @entity8 and the wedding ring which was found four decades after it was lost back in its rightful place : mr @entity28 holds his wife 's hand as she wears the ring which was lost for four decades after giving up on the ring in the 70s , @entity2 and @entity8 thought nothing more of it until this week when @entity8 strolled past the same area - now fields - and spotted a neighbour with a metal detector			1
he looking for ancient coins , but @entity8 left him with a description of the long - lost jewellery , and roughly where it was lost , just in case			1
the couple were stunned when the neighbour rang him a few days later to say he 'd found the nine - carat ring			1
incredibly , it was still in near - perfect condition , despite being buried beneath soil for 41 years			0
@entity8 said : ' back then the ring cost me a fortune			0
when @entity2 told me she 'd lost it we went back up there with our own metal detectors			2
' but they were not nearly as good as they are now and we did n't find it			0
eventually we had to buy a replacement			0
' reunited : @entity2 's wedding ring which was found four decades after it was lost then and now : mr and mrs @entity2 photographed left on their wedding day in september 1969 , and right today in the field were the ring was found by a neighbour who 'd been hunting for treasure with his metal detector explaining how he came across the neighbouring treasure hunter , @entity8 said : ' i was going out in the village and saw him up in the field , and when i saw his wife i asked her : " what 's he up to in the field with that metal detector ? tell him if he finds a ring , it belongs to @entity2			1
" ' then i had a phone call telling me that he had found a ring			0
i could n't believe it after all these years			0
' @entity8 had saved up to buy the ring for @entity2 before the pair married in september 1969			2
she had only been wearing it for three years when she lost it while uprooting veg near their home on the outskirts of @entity10 , @entity11			2
but the treasure hunter managed to find the ring in almost exactly the same spot where @entity2 had dropped it			1
happy day : incredibly , the ring was still in near - perfect condition , despite being buried beneath soil for 41 years mr @entity28 's brother @entity99 handing him the ring before his wedding : he had saved up for the 9 - carat band the couple took the ring to a local jewellers to have a small crack repaired but it 's now as good as new and back on @entity2 's finger			1
she said : ' i was working in the field when i took my gloves off , and that 's probably when it came off			0
' when we got the phone call to say it had been found i did n't know what to say			0
' the ring 's locator , who wishes to remain anonymous , said : ' it was in absolutely perfect condition , despite the number of years it had been there			0
' i 'm interested in history and i have often found medieval coins which are absolutely fascinating			2
that 's why i was up there			0
