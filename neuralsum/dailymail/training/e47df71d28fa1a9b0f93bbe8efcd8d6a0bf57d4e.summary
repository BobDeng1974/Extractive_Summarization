aside from the time travelling @entity2 and coveted hoverboard , the @entity1 franchise featured another simpler , yet equally futuristic design - self - tying laces			1
during @entity7 , @entity5 , played by @entity6 , puts on a pair of @entity9 that automatically tighten and adjust to fit his feet - using so - called power laces			1
@entity9 released a limited range of @entity5 's @entity12 with manual laces in 2011 , and now designer @entity14 has revealed the power laces will arrive in 2015			1
inspired by this board , a team of @entity25 inventors designed the @entity28 board - a four - wheel drive motorised skateboard capable of reaching 31mph ( 50kmh )			2
elsewhere , @entity32 - based @entity31 created a self balancing , one wheeled skateboard			0
called the @entity36 , the $ 1300 gadget can reach speeds on 12mph , and turn 360 degrees within the length of the board			0
@entity14 made these comments because 2015 was the year @entity7 was set in			2
speaking at the @entity40 in @entity41 @entity14 told @entity42 : ' are we gon na see power laces in 2015 ? to that , i say yes ! ' rumours about the technology have been circling since 2010 when @entity9 applied for a patent for ' automatically lacing trainers			1
' it said : ' the automatic lacing system provides a set of straps that can be automatically opened and closed to switch between a loosened and tightened position of the upper			0
' the article further includes an automatic ankle cinching system that is configured to automatically adjust an ankle portion of the upper			0
’ the @entity1 - inspired @entity60 range was then launched in 2011			1
much loved : @entity6 starred in 1985 's @entity1 - the first in three films starring the actor and @entity64 rumours about the technology have been circling since 2010 when @entity9 applied for a patent for ' automatically lacing trainers '			1
@entity9 then released a range of @entity1 - inspired @entity9 , pictured , in 2011 only 1,500 models of the @entity71 , pictured , were made , and every pair was auctioned off on @entity73			2
a total of $ 6million ( £ 3.5million ) was raised from the sales of these shoes , and all the proceeds went to the @entity78 the announcement about the power laces was made by @entity9 designer @entity14 , pictured , yet he did not expand further only 1,500 models of the @entity9 were made , and every pair was auctioned off on @entity73			2
a total of $ 6million ( £ 3.5million ) was raised from the sales of these shoes , and all the proceeds went to the @entity87			0
@entity89 - based inventor @entity88 has already created her own self - tying laces , a prototype which she says will ' tide you over until @entity9 comes out with something more polished			1
' using an @entity97 microcontroller , @entity88 fitted a sensor to a @entity99			0
when a person steps into the shoe , a force sensor reads the pressure of their foot and activates two servo motors , which apply tension to the laces , tightening the shoe			0
a touch switch can be used to reverse the servos			0

designer @entity14 announced the plans at an event in @entity41
self - tying laces were worn by @entity5 in 1989 film @entity7
@entity9 applied for a patent for automatically lacing trainers in 2010
in 2011 , the firm launched its @entity60 range of shoes inspired by the film
the laces are *expected* to be available by in 2015
