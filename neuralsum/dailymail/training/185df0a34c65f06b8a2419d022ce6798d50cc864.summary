leading smartphones are routinely chewing up more data than tablets , according to a report			0

they also use @entity156 meaning that you are not eating into your allowance when you surf the web			0
researchers found that smartphones tend to use significantly more data than a tablet analytics firm @entity164 examined the data demands of more than one million users over a 24 hour period in november last year covering 125 different devices			2
