by @entity0 a civilian crew damaged a $ 1.5 billion 27,000 tonne warship to be known as @entity3 , when they took it out on a test cruise between @entity6 and @entity7 , it has been reported			1
the hull of the @entity9 was damaged and its electrical systems melted down during the ship ’s first ' shakedown cruise ' , which tests a ship ’s performance before it enters service			1
the crew from @entity17 who crewed the vessel encountered two problems , both of which were the result of user error , reported @entity24			1
the @entity3 had an electrical meltdown and had its hull damaged during a test voyage by a civilian crew a source said the first issue occurred when the electric powered pods at the stern of the ship were operated independently in low - speed mode when the ship was travelling at high speed , when they should have been operated in tandem , which caused serious vibrations across the ship			1
a source told @entity24 : ' it was like the shaking floor in an amusement park house of fun			2
' once the pods were back in the correct mode the vibration ceased			2
' the vibration caused paint to be stripped form the ship ’s hull , though damage was minimal			1
both issues were the result of user error and occurred during a ' shakedown cruise ' from @entity6 to @entity7 in may the vessel is the first of the two @entity59 that are being built for the @entity60			1
the @entity3 should be commissioned later in the year length : 230.82 m displacement : 27,500 tonnes speed : maximum of 20 knots carrying capacity : up to 110 vehicles , 1,600 troops cost to build : $ 1.5 billion each the @entity3 is one of two @entity9 ships being built for the @entity60 , the other , the @entity68 is still being fitted out			1
the will be the largest vessels ever operated by the @entity60			2
they will likely be operated out of @entity73 in @entity74			2
the @entity3 also reportedly suffered an electrical power failure when the crew forgot to disconnect the emergency power , resulting in the circuit breakers melting			1
the error resulted in the vessel losing steerage and forced the crew to drop anchor for four hours			1
the source told @entity24 that ' there were no major design errors during the trials and both issues were operator errors			2
' a spokesperson for @entity90 , who supplied the crew for the sea trial denied the claims that any problems occurred during the sea trial due to user error			1
' [ c ] laims that the hull of the @entity3 was damaged and that an electrical system melted down are fallacious , ' he said			1
' the claim that @entity102 were negligent resulting in damage to the vessel is completely false			2
' the @entity3 is the first of two @entity59 being built for the @entity107 navy			1
other problems detected during the shakedown cruise were corrosion in propeller nuts and a small crack in the hull of the ship , caused by the long barge journey made by the ship from @entity117 , where it was built			1
the next round of sea trials for the ship will be in july and she is due to be handed to the navy later this year			2
guided @entity123 – a long - range escort ship , with air defence , anti-submarine warfare , surveillance , interdiction and reconnaissance			0
frigate helicopter – a long - range escort ship with helicopter landing facilities			0
@entity135 – these ships are named after cities and towns with close links with @entity60 heritage			0
they have attack capabilities , as well as the abilitiy to intercept and apprehend vessels			0
@entity146 – has excellent shock resistance and sonar capable of detecting mines underwater			0
landing ship , @entity152 – a multi-purpose troop and heavy vehicle carrier with facilities for helicopter landing			0
able to carry the heaviest load of all carriers			0
landing ship , dock – these have a large flight deck and the ability to load and transport large number of troops and heavy vehicles			0
landing craft , @entity152 – these vessels are able to move large amounts of cargo , personnel and equipment from larger ships to shore			0
surveying ship – these produce nautical charts of the earth ’s surface , which is particularly important , as around @entity107 , less than half of the area has been surveyed to acceptable standards , making ocean travel more dangerous			0
@entity188 , @entity146 – these ships perform surveying work , but in shallower and more constrained waters , particularly around the water of northern @entity107			0
support ship – these replenishment oilers have fuel tanks and dry cargo holds and can replenish other ships while underway on the high seas			0
submarines – these guided missile submarines move almost silently , and have a sophisticated combat system			0
ancillary craft – various craft include landing craft , inflatable boats , a light utility boat and a ceremonial admiral ’s @entity210 .			0

the @entity3 was damaged during a ' shakedown cruise '
electrical systems melted down and the hull was damaged in the may trials
the problems resulted from user error on the part of the civilian crew
