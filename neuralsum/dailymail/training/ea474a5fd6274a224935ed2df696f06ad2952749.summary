@entity5 , of @entity6 in @entity7 , was sentenced in her absence at @entity9 today			1
the mother - of - four had denied obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception and perverting the course of justice , but was convicted of both charges last month			1
guilty : @entity5 spun a tangled web of lies , including getting her daughter to pose as her to avoid finger print detection she was not able to attend her sentencing as she had taken an overdose of pills and alcohol shortly before she was due to appear and was admitted to @entity24 in @entity25			1
judge @entity27 - @entity26 branded the 44 - year - old ' devious , manipulative and thoroughly dishonest ' , adding she was prepared to go to extraordinary lengths to serve her own selfish interests			2
@entity32 ' criminal past dated back to january 1995 , when she was jailed for a year at @entity34 for a £ 90,000 mortgage fraud			2
at her latest trial , @entity5 denied she had either served a prison sentence or had a criminal record , but police had her finger prints from when she was originally arrested			2
lies : @entity5 had denied having a criminal record , despite police having finger print evidence after her release , she studied law at the @entity47 in @entity48 , and later trained to be a teacher at the @entity50			1
she then applied for a teaching post at @entity52 in @entity9 , but crucially failed to reveal her conviction for fraud			1
the court heard @entity5 made similar applications to @entity57 in @entity58 and @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity9 , again failing to declare her conviction			1
at her latest trial , prosector @entity62 said : ' the decision by her not to disclose previous convictions was deliberate because she feared if she did disclose them she would jeopardise her chances of being employed by the school			2
' she was employed by the school from may 2001 to february 2005 , when she was sacked for gross misconduct			1
in 2007 she sued @entity52 for £ 1.2million for unfair dismissal , claiming racial and sexual discrimination			2
@entity5 won her case after a 42 - day hearing , but during the case it emerged she may have had a criminal conviction , an accusation she flatly denied			1
mr @entity62 said : ' having lied on her application form to @entity52 she was no doubt aware if her previous convictions came to light she would have committed an offence			0
' in all likelihood she would have been dismissed from her job and prosecuted for that			0
' she knew if her lie about her background was found out before the tribunal concluded her award damages might be significantly reduced , ' he added			0
' in order to maintain the lie about her background and clear the way for future employment she and her daughter conspired to pervert the course of justice			2
' sentencing : @entity5 was handed two years behind bars after being found guilty of perverting the course of justice and gaining a pecuniary advantage through deception in the end she was awarded damages totaling £ 28,500 , although it is not clear if she ever received the money			1
in an attempt to distance herself from her past , during her tribunal she had offered to have her finger prints taken again and hatched a plan for her daughter @entity108 to pose as her			0
when a fingerprint expert went to @entity108 's home in 2009 , @entity108 had answered the door with her face covered and handed over her mother 's driving licence as proof of identity			0
@entity108 had denied this at the trial , saying : ' i would not pretend to be my mother			0
i would not have given my mother 's licence and covered my face			0
' she now admits she lied on oath			0
the plan unraveled because 24 - year - old 's prints were already on the police file - @entity108 had herself been convicted of forging a cheque to pay for a £ 3,200 breast enlargement , for which she was handed a suspended sentence and unpaid work at @entity136 earlier that year			0
she also had previous convictions for shoplifting in 2009 , and theft in 2004			0
