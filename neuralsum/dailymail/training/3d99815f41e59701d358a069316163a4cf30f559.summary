by @entity0 published : 11:54 est , 24 august 2013 updated : 06:59 est , 25 august 2013 this crazy komodo dragon does not show a hint of camera shyness as it shows off its dance skills for a lucky photographer			1
the @entity7 reptile was spotted in a park near amateur photographer @entity10 's home in @entity11 , @entity12 , while he was out searching for local wildlife			2
although the lizard was busy hunting insects , it still had time to stop and perform a quick dance before dashing off into the bushes in search of its next meal			0
flexible : this young komodo dragon pulled some unusual poses for a photographer walking past in @entity12 @entity10 was not in any danger when the picture was taken as the komodo is only young			1
it is unlikely that it would ever have come so close had it been an adult			0
as adults they can reach 10 feet in length and weigh more than 300 pounds , making them the heaviest lizards on @entity36			0
they can eat a remarkable 80 per cent of their body weight in a single feeding			1
@entity10 said ' i spotted some movement in the bushes while out looking for wildlife and as i got closer i could see the lizard jumping around trying to catch insects			0
' i could nâ€™t believe the picture when i got home and checked my camera , the picture is hilarious			0
@entity51 : the obliging lizard struck a pose before scuttling off to catch insects ' there was nobody else around when i saw the lizard so i think the performance was especially for me			2
' when i showed my photographer friends and they kept asking how i managed to get the lizard to dance for me ? ' at no point was i in danger as the @entity63 is not very old but i would never have approached a full grown adult as they are extremely dangerous			1

@entity51 young lizard performed a dance for photographer in @entity12
young komodo dragon was not dangerous but an adult would have been
adults can eat 80 per cent of their body weight in a single feeding
they have been known to attack humans and to eat them
