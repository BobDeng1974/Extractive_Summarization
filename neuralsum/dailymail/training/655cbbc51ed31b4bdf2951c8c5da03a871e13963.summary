' although he can remember very little , he said he has one vivid memory of one of the dogs ' calmly ' licking his ankle as others attacked			2

fighting on : @entity4 , who hopes to get prosthetic limbs ones day , also lost his left ear in the attack staying upbeat : @entity4 , one of six siblings , had been missing for about a year before the incident but after his sister read about his plight in the paper , she called the hospital and identified him one 911 caller described the dogs as ' all over him '			1

@entity4 was rushed to hospital , where he underwent multiple skin grafts to cover the bones in his right arm and leg			1
he has lost most of his leg below the knee , his arm and one of his ears			1
investigation : @entity93 , 61 , who owned the dogs , may still face charges in the case despite his horrifying ordeal , @entity4 told the newspaper that he believes the attack happened for a reason : to reunite him with his family			1
before the attack , he had been missing for a year			1
he had previously lived in @entity103 , @entity9 but was homeless so stayed with a friend - but when that friend lost his home , he had to move on			2
he had been in @entity8 for a year , and his family did not know where he was			0

until then , he was a ' @entity114 '			0
he has now been reunited with his siblings			0
' it 's a good feeling being alive , ' he said			0
' there 's moments when i 'm barely myself			0
there 's moments when i can barely function			0
and i 'm insecure â€¦ but i do seem to make it back to this place where i am myself			0
