@entity0 refused to stand behind one of the opposition mascots before @entity4 's game with @entity5 on tuesday , seemingly because the youngster was too tall			1
at 5ft 7in , the @entity8 midfielder is no giant , and he stood away from his team - mates as the national anthems were sung			2
but @entity0 is not alone			0
poor old @entity12 is only 5 foot 6 inches , so it seemed a little cruel when @entity14 assigned the tallest mascot to the @entity16 ahead of the quarter - final against @entity18 at the @entity19			2
the @entity35 will be hoping qualification for @entity37 is n't such a tall order after defeat in their opening game			0
new boss @entity42 has endured a tough start after @entity45 's departure for @entity46 , losing 2 - 0 to @entity47 last week before the loss in @entity49			0
things did n't get much better for @entity0 as @entity4 lost 2 - 1 to the @entity5 @entity51 and co have struggled since @entity42 took charge of the @entity35 national side			1

@entity0 was almost blocked from view by large mascot
@entity8 midfielder moved to one side as national anthem was sung
@entity12 suffered *similar* fate at the @entity19
@entity4 lost 2 - 1 to @entity5
