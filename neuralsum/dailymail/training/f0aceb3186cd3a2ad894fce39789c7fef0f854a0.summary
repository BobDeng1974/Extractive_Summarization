in december 2012 – after languishing on bail for four months – police dropped the charges after prosecutors concluded he used ‘ reasonable force in self - defence ’			2

my boss came out and told me to leave work because he heard that on the radio and sent me home			0
‘ i went from being a hero who saved my mum ’s life while standing up to a thief , to people thinking there was something i was hiding			0
their assumption was , “ what is he not telling us ? what is he hiding ? ” ‘ it is a huge burden because people who i used to work with think i ’m a liar who has not been telling the truth			0
court documents claim the @entity106 ( pictured ) was wrongly briefed by senior @entity18 police officers that mr @entity6 tried to shoot out the thief ’s tyres during the high - speed chase ‘ farmers have tens of thousands pounds of equipment and machinery and why would they trust me on their machinery ? you 're finished if something happens and they do n't trust you			1
