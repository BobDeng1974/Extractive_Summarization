@entity0 has endured another awkward grilling on live television after calling @entity4 host @entity3 the wrong name on two occasions			1
the prime minister appeared on @entity8 's @entity4 on monday to face questions over his low approval rating and to talk about his paid parental leave plan			1
but just like his interview with @entity15 on rival program today last week , the dialogue with @entity13 did n't go so well			2
' @entity22 , sorry @entity3 ... we 're not the first government that 's had a rough patch in the polls			0
we 're getting on with delivering for the @entity28 people , ' mr @entity0 said			2
as the prime minister listed promises and policies the @entity33 government had delivered on in its first year , @entity13 interrupted and told him people were actually focusing on the promises he had broken			1
' the public feels like you have lied to them consistently over your first term , ' @entity13 told the pm			2
the interview started with @entity13 quoting the new opinion poll results and saying mr @entity0 was ' now as unpopular as @entity21 at her lowest ' as the prime minister listed promises and policies the @entity33 government had delivered on in its first year , @entity13 interrupted and told people were actually focusing on the promises he had broken ' they did n't think they 'd get a $ 7 co-payment or have to pay university fees … all things that you 've broken since then			1
' do you need to apologise to the public and say " yeah i 've let you down , i did lie to you , i did break a lot of promises but hey i 'm going to rebuild from here ? "			2
' after repeated questions from @entity13 asking if the prime minister would apologise to the public , mr @entity0 slipped up on his name again			1
' well @entity22 , @entity13 , i do not accept the accusations that you ’re making			0
i just do n’t accept them , ' he said shaking his head			0
' i think there are a lot of things that people have said and frankly a lot of these so called commitments were commitments other people had attributed to us post the election			0
' sunrise host @entity13 repeatedly asked mr @entity0 is he was going to apologise to the public over his broken election promises mr @entity0 had a radio interview with the @entity79 's @entity78 prior to @entity4 , which may explain the slip - up			1
in last week 's interview on @entity82 , mr @entity0 took aim at the @entity84 saying they were trying to sabotage the government 's budget and he wished they were n't ' in such a feral mood '			1
@entity15 hit back by saying he was exactly the same in @entity90			0
' with respect you were fairly feral in @entity90 were n't you , i mean the greatest respect by that , and ... why would ( @entity96 ) do anything different when it worked for you ? ' @entity15 asked			0
' the reality here is that the budget position is in a shambles and every day it does get worse			0
' no one is buying what you are selling , what you are laying down			0
' it comes a just week after mr @entity0 came under fire from @entity82 's @entity15 mr @entity0 took aim at the @entity84 saying they were trying to sabotage the government 's budget and he wished they were n't ' in such a feral mood '			1
