each household is committed to contributing £ 116 to foreign aid projects , such as wind turbines in @entity16 and greener cattle farming in @entity18 , over a four - year period ending in 2015			1
conservative climate change minister @entity2 said the £ 2.9billion was a sensible investment which was needed to prevent more ‘ failed states ’ as a result of ‘ dangerous climate change ’			1
mr @entity2 , speaking at the @entity25 climate talks in @entity26 , @entity27 , added that the @entity6 ’s economy was well - placed to benefit from the growing global investment in renewable energy			1
@entity6 is the only developed nation that has so far publicly committed funds , known as climate aid , over the next three years to help poorer nations adapt to the impact of rising temperatures , such as floods and droughts			1
the pledge has angered some @entity38 , who believe the money could be better spent in times of economic hardship at home			0
@entity44 , conservative mp for @entity45 , said the government ’s spend on climate aid was a ‘ complete waste ’			0
he added : ‘ energy costs are impacting on @entity6 households and businesses			2
i think tackling that should be the absolute focus of the government at the moment , not spending millions supporting wind farms abroad			0
’ but mr @entity2 said : ‘ we are extracting value for money [ on climate aid ]			2
i think it represents a sensible investment for @entity6 people			0
‘ if we turn our back on the developing world we will see more failed states , we will see countries struggling and failing to deal with the impact of dangerous climate change			2
and , ultimately , we pay the price in @entity6 lives			0
’ helping developing countries : foreign aid projects such as wind turbines in @entity16 will receive money over a four - year period ending in 2015 save ' @entity6 lives ' : support foreign aid projects including greener cattle farming in @entity18 mean the @entity6 's economy will be well - placed to benefit from the growing global investment in renewable energy , mr @entity2 said the minister warned climate change would be ‘ a very aggravating factor ’ that could threaten the future stability of countries such as @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			1
he said growing investment in the renewable sector could also benefit @entity6 economically , adding : ‘ these talks are about making an audacious land - grab for the multi-trillion low carbon market for the @entity93			1
’ @entity6 ’s ‘ climate aid ’ includes more than £ 100million pledged for renewable power generation in @entity16 , such as wind farms , solar , bio-energy and hydroelectric power			1
another £ 21million has been pledged to provide better water resources management for 18million of the world ’s poorest inhabitants			0
@entity6 is also giving the @entity18 government £ 15million to support ‘ low carbon agriculture ’ by helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ranching			2
it aims to save carbon emissions , protect forests and improve the livelihoods of farmers			0
@entity111 energy secretary @entity111 said : ‘ the problem is sometimes people look at the numbers rather than looking at the outcomes – the advantages of spending money in this way			0
whether it ’s bringing clean energy to @entity16 , whether it ’s preventing the rainforest being chopped down in parts of @entity124 and @entity125 , these are huge benefits			0
’ in chaotic @entity25 climate talks in @entity128 in 2009 , rich countries pledged to provide £ 6billion a year over three years as ‘ fast start finance ’			0
