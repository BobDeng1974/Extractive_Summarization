i ’m now a victim in my home and it ’s completely legal			0
' legal problems : the @entity19 's have said that they ca n't believe the battle to have @entity8 removed @entity112 of the @entity113 confirmed to @entity42 they can not do anything at the moment because , ' generally , once somebody has established residency , you have to go through a formal eviction process			1
