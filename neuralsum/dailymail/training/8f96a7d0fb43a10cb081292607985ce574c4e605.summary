@entity0 , five , from @entity1 in northwestern @entity2 , is a happy little girl who loves playing with her sisters and is doted on by her mother @entity4 and father @entity5			1
but the future is bleak for little @entity0 because , having been forced to flee to @entity7 in the face of the is advance through @entity2 , she has no access to the medical care she desperately needs			1
' she ca n’t cope with the cold weather , ' says her worried mother			2
' she has almost no chance of surviving if she does n’t get care or a warm house			2
' happy little girl : @entity0 , left , plays with her sister @entity18 and her mother @entity4 in the refugee camp they call home and , as a heartbreaking new documentary makes clear , @entity0 , who suffers from spina bifida and is paralysed from the waist down , is by no means unique			1
more than a million @entity2 refugees currently live in @entity7 , eking out a living in the makeshift camps that dot the countryside			1
making the problem worse is the islamic state advance , as refugees fleeing the jihadis add to pressure on camp clinics and food supplies			1
although agencies such as @entity40 are attempting to deal with the influx , life for disabled refugees , among them those who have lost limbs thanks to the bloody civil war , is particularly difficult			2
@entity0 , who suffers from spinal bifida , has a shunt that drains fluid from her brain , although it has n't been replaced since she arrived at the camp			1
scarce : with more refugees flooding in , in the face of the is advance , finding doctors to treat @entity0 is impossible desperate times : @entity0 's father @entity5 has been unable to find work in the camp and says he feels useless she is also prone to pressure sores , which are now being treated by her mother , albeit with a wadded up old t - shirt instead of the dressings she needs			1
the situation is far from ideal and her father , the manager of a soap factory in their old life in @entity2 , knows it			2
' it ’s very difficult , ' he admits			0
when i ’m sitting at home without work [ to pay for medical care ] i might as well be a chair			1
' the family do get some help from @entity40 in the form of food coupons worth $ 140 a month but doctors require money that @entity4 , a former school teacher , and @entity5 just do n't have			2
' you need money to go to hospital , but i have to borrow money just to buy bread for my children , ' says @entity4			0
' that ’s all i can do big cuddle : @entity0 , who her mother describes as being ' like sunshine ' , reaches over to give @entity4 a hug help : @entity0 's older sister @entity18 was the one who carried her into @entity7 as the family fled the @entity93 advance limited : although the family are given money to buy food by @entity40 , funds for medical care are nonexistent ' you can see our humiliation , ' she adds			1
' you see your daughter dying and no - one helps			0
in this camp no - one helps anyone			0
' we did n’t live like this in @entity2			1
my children went to the best schools			0
we lived a happy life in @entity2			2
' but help , it seems , is not likely to be forthcoming any time soon			0
' i would be the first to tell you that what refugees are able to receive does not meet all their needs , ' admits @entity40 's @entity115			0
' with 30 per cent of our budget funded , it ’s simply impossible for us to cover all the basic needs that we need to cover			0
' i feel so sad for them , so sad for their families , and also very sad for the frontline workers that have to be able to say i ’m so sorry , we feel your need but we ’re just unable to do anything about it because we do n’t have the resources to do it			0
deadly : as is advance , more and more refugees are flocking across the border to @entity7 horror : although air strikes have been launched against @entity93 , they still hold several towns , including @entity136 ' and it all comes back to where is the source of this problem ? the source of this problem is the on - going conflict in @entity2 that is wreaking havoc in this region , and that has torn apart so many lives with devastating consequences to @entity0 and to others			1
' in the meantime , @entity4 and @entity5 are hoping for a miracle			0
' she makes me feel that life is beautiful no matter what , ' says @entity4 of her youngest child			0
' she ’s stronger than she looks			0
when she was born , the doctors said there was no chance for her to survive and yet she ’s still alive ' @entity0 does n’t want to die			1

@entity0 , five , has spina bifida and lives in a refugee camp near @entity163
more than a million @entity2 refugees have fled across the border to @entity7
the influx has worsened as @entity169 jihadis advance across @entity2
@entity0 has no access to medical care and as a result , is unlikely to survive
her mother says her daughter does n't want to die and is desperate to live
@entity0 and her family appear on @entity180 , *tonight* at *7.30pm* on @entity181 or *online* at @entity182
