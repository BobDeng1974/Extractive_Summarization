by @entity0 published : 03:31 est , 26 july 2013 updated : 05:56 est , 26 july 2013 lead exposure can damage a child 's developing brain a study has found that there is more than just chilli lurking in hot sauce - high amounts of poisonous lead are also contained in a range of spicy relishes			1
a variety of piquant sauces were tested , and discovered to exceed 0.1 ppm lead - the @entity16 standard for unsafe levels of the chemical			1
out of 25 bottles of imported hot sauces , four - all from @entity19 and made by different manufacturers - were found to have a high amount of the metal			1
lead exposure can damage a child 's developing brain and lead to a lower iq			1
overall , lead poisoning in the @entity29 has declined significantly since it was removed from paints and gasoline formulas			0
@entity32 , @entity33 ( @entity34 ) researchers @entity35 and professor @entity37 subjected the variety of sauces to the tests as hot relishes have long been suspected of containing lead			1
their study , published in the @entity45 , explained how the products were shaken for a minute and then analyzed for lead concentrations and ph levels , the @entity34 website reported			0
they also tested the lead content of the packaging , as that has a history of seeping into products and contaminating them			2
it was then that they found that 16 per cent of the @entity19 and @entity59 products contained the high levels - but did not specify which ones they had tested			2
@entity32 , @entity33 researchers @entity35 and professor @entity37 subjected the variety of sauces to the tests ( posed ) they warned that if hot sauce is a regular feature of someone 's diet - particularly a child where spicy food is part of their culture - they could be at risk			1
following the shocking find , researchers have demanded a more demanding testing process			0
prof @entity80 told the @entity34 : ' the results indicate the need for more rigorous screening protocols for products imported in @entity19 , including an applicable standard for hot sauce			1
' without enforceable standards for hot sauces and condiments , manufacturers will not be encouraged to improve quality control measures designed to reduce the amounts of lead and other toxic elements before exporting			0
' lead had long been considered a threat to a child			2
in january , research found that cities where lead pollution was reduced experienced falling levels of robbery and violent crime around 20 years later			2
similarly , an increase in lead pollution prompted an increase in violence two decades later , scientists found			0
researchers believe that exposure to toxic lead in the environment damages children ’s brains and could make them more likely to commit violent crime when they grow up			0
professor @entity115 , of @entity116 in @entity117 , who has studied the effect of lead on children , said there was a ‘ strong association ’ between criminal activity and lead			0
dr @entity125 , professor of environmental toxicology at @entity127 , said : ‘ we know that lead exposure in children and infants , when the brain is developing , damages the brain , and we know that children who are exposed to lead have a lower iq			1
‘ these children tend to be more impulsive and find it more difficult to concentrate			0
what these studies are saying is that following exposure in infancy the effect on the body seems to predispose , or is certainly strongly linked , with violent behaviour in adulthood			0

out of 25 tested bottles , four were found to exceed 0.1ppm lead

@entity32 researchers demand more rigorous screening tests
