@entity0 director of rugby @entity1 believes it is only a matter of time before @entity4 is restored to the @entity6 fold			1
@entity4 excelled in saturday 's roller - coaster @entity8 victory over @entity10 , scoring the crucial try in the 70th minute at @entity12			2
the 22 - year - old wing won the last of his seven caps as a replacement last autumn , but was overlooked by @entity6 throughout the @entity17			0
@entity0 winger @entity18 crosses for his side 's first try at the @entity12 ‘ we ’ve had a difficult year , but anyone who has watched him will know he ’s been absolutely outstanding			2
when we get back to winning he will get recognition again , ’ @entity22 said			0
@entity0 spent most of an uninspiring mid-table clash feeding off scraps due to the overwhelming superiority of the visiting scrum , only to produce the key drive in the 70th minute that was finished by @entity4			0
as half time drew close , referee @entity31 had finally lost patience with @entity0 set - piece frailty and pointed the finger at @entity36 by sending the club captain to the sin - bin			2
@entity10 only entered the interval 13 - 11 ahead - a poor return given their ascendency - and then moved 18 - 11 clear through a @entity40 try with half an hour remaining to suggest their eighth win of the season was imminent			1
@entity0 centre @entity44 puts in a strong fend on @entity10 lock @entity46 the kicking of @entity50 kept @entity0 in touch - the @entity48 fly - half finished with 14 points - before an eventful final quarter produced a flurry of yellow cards and three tries			1
@entity4 seized the initiative for the @entity59 club and full - back @entity60 appeared to have sealed the victory , only for @entity64 's try with a minute left to give @entity10 a faint glimmer of hope until they aimlessly kicked the ball away in the last act of the game			1
the opening 10 minutes were dominated by @entity10 's scrum , yet it was @entity0 who opened the scoring when outside centre @entity75 jinked into space before sending @entity18 over			1
@entity18 's try was the result of a clinical counter attack , but the 2012 @entity8 champions were immediately back under pressure once play resumed with their set - piece targeted once more , conceding a penalty that @entity86 sent between the uprights			0
@entity89 8 @entity88 is hit hard by @entity0 flanker @entity90 @entity86 and @entity50 exchanged penalties and just as @entity0 began to attack with greater frequency , yet another retreating scrum gave @entity10 the platform to race into a 31st minute lead			1
@entity96 broke the gainline with a large dummy - his second of the afternoon - and found @entity99 in support , with the outside centre showing strength to force his way over from 10 yards out			0
@entity10 's set - piece dominance was rewarded when @entity31 sent @entity36 to the sin bin , but they were unable to turn a push late in the first half into points			2
a big step and outside - break from full - back @entity111 created a half - chance for @entity4 moments after the interval , but the @entity6 wing was well tackled			1
@entity116 tries to evade the clutches of @entity119 flanker @entity118 it was then @entity10 's turn to find space through @entity122 down the right wing only for @entity40 to drop what should have been a try scoring pass			2
two attacking scrums later , however , and @entity40 dived over after @entity99 had spotted the overlap caused by @entity0 being sucked into the one - sided forward exchanges			0
@entity50 ' boot whittled down the deficit to one point but as the match entered the final quarter number eight @entity90 was shown a yellow card for a shoulder challenge on @entity40 and @entity86 rifled over the ensuing penalty			0
@entity10 scrum half @entity64 crosses the @entity0 whitewash for a late score despite being a man down , @entity0 almost scored with two successive rolling mauls and on both occasions @entity10 saw a player sin - binned - replacement lock @entity143 for bringing down the first drive and @entity40 for a deliberate knock on			1
on the third line - out catch and drive they succeeded , with @entity4 touching down as the game entered the final 10 minutes			0
@entity111 and replacement scrum - half @entity64 then swapped late tries to bring the game to a dramatic if scrappy conclusion .			0

@entity10 led 13 - 11 at half - time thanks to a @entity156 try
a @entity18 try and two @entity50 penalties kept @entity0 in the hunt
@entity40 register another try for the @entity163 and @entity119
but two more @entity50 three - pointers kept the home side in front
late tries from @entity4 and @entity60 secured the win
