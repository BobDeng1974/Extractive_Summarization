by @entity0 follow @ @ marthakelner @entity1 is only 21 but he is hobbling around the office building at @entity3 like a wizened old man			1
a crashing fall at @entity6 the previous evening has left him barely able to walk			2
most people would be in bed but @entity1 , like all jump jockeys , is a breed apart			1
his most pressing concern is not the crippling bruising on his left hip but passing a medical examination so he can ride at @entity15 that afternoon			2
‘ i spent the night with it iced up , ’ he said			2
‘ but then the ice fell off my leg and my bed was soaking wet when i woke up			2
i ’ll ice it in the lorry on the way down to take away the swelling			2
they make you do squats and press - ups to show you ’re ok			2
they ’re very good at strapping you up and getting you back out there			2
’ falls are as much a part of the job as hot baths to make weight and studying the formbook every morning			0
@entity1 knows they are coming — ‘ i think one in every eight or nine rides ends on the deck ’ — but it would never stop him from racing			1
@entity1 is relishing his new role as stable jockey for @entity42 the risk of bone - crunching falls is even perversely useful in engendering a sense of brotherhood in the weighing room			1
‘ you ’re like a massive dysfunctional family in there , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ you might not get along with the lad three pegs down but if he was to have a fall you ’d be the first to help him out , get his car home and see him in the hospital			0
’ @entity1 is the hottest property in race riding			1
last month he was made stable jockey for @entity42 — champion trainer in eight of the last nine years — and had his first winner in his new job on @entity61 on thursday evening			1
@entity42 has previously shared his best horses among a number of jockeys but @entity1 will have the pick of the bunch this season			1
it is a move which means he could be the biggest threat to the dominance of @entity71 in the last two decades			1
not that he has any ideas about toppling the greatest champion racing has ever had			2
‘ to think about ever challenging him is crazy , ’ he said in reverential tones			0
‘ you would n’t ever think about trying to beat @entity78 @entity77 ’s tried for 19 years and finished second and third every time			0
i think @entity78 ’s the most dominant champion in world sport , just to ride in the same generation as him is a privilege			1
the long - term dream for me is to be champion jockey but it ’s never going to happen when @entity78 ’s around			1
laid - back : @entity1 was relaxing at his father 's yard in the @entity89 ‘ the day @entity78 retires is going to be a sad day for racing because we ’ll all miss him , but it ’s going to be so competitive because the whole thing ’s going to open up			1
the domination he has is amazing			0
’ @entity1 was three years old when @entity71 won the first of his 19 champion jockey titles in 1996			1
with his lightly freckled face , red hair and airy charm , he oozes youth but has had a whole lifetime preparing for this career			0
the oldest son of trainer @entity103 grew up in @entity104 , the home of jump racing , surrounded by jockeys			2
‘ @entity107 was stable jockey for my dad when i was growing up			1
he won two @entity109 on saturdays and then was sat down with us on monday morning at the kitchen table eating boiled eggs and soldiers for breakfast before we went to school			0
family affair : @entity1 will keep the ride on his father 's star horse @entity120 , who is a leading contender for next year 's @entity122 ‘ i learned so much from having all these amazing jockeys around so there ’s no way i would be riding as well as i am without having my start here			1
but at the same time , the early days were all about trying to prove myself , to show that i was n’t just getting rides because of my dad			0
‘ i did all the mucking out and riding out the same as everyone but i think sometimes people did n’t understand that at first			0
’ @entity1 is rake thin , with his tracksuit bottoms hanging from his hips and wearing a @entity134 hoodie bought during a trip to @entity136 last week with fellow jockeys @entity137 and @entity139			1
‘ i went away to @entity134 weighing 9st11 and came back 9st12 despite eating three massive meals a day			0
i ’m quite lucky in that respect			0
’ younger brother @entity143 , 19 , rides on the flat and is stable jockey for @entity146			1
rising star : @entity1 ' spiralling profile has seen him get the job as @entity42 ' stable jockey ‘ you would n’t believe we were brothers , ’ said @entity1 , ‘ he ’s 6ft tall and made of nothing			1
because he has to watch his weight so much he ’d be lucky to have a meal a day so he ’s grumpy a lot of the time			0
he ’s very quiet because he saves so much of the energy for trying to be bubbly in the paddock beforehand			0
he ’s great fun when he ’s eating and drinking normally			0
‘ it ’s hard watching what he does but those are the sacrifices he ’s willing to make			0
we all make sacrifices because it ’s the best job in the country			0
’ a natural raconteur , @entity1 is more ebullient than most jockeys and sees his responsibilities as extending beyond the winning post			2
‘ i try to be happy , ’ he said			0
‘ when the owners are there i try to make their five minutes before and after their horse has run enjoyable			0
even if i ’ve pulled it up five out , if i can somehow put a smile on their face afterwards then i ’ve done my job			0

the 21 - year - old is the new stable jockey for champion trainer @entity42
@entity1 will keep the ride on his father 's star *hurdler* @entity120
says @entity71 is ' most dominant champion in world sport '
