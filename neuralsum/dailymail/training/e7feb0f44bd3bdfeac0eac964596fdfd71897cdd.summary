by @entity0 , @entity1 on sunday political correspondent questioned : ex-ukip candidate @entity3 , who was called into the police after a diatribe comparing @entity6 to an ape a @entity9 mp called in the police after his @entity11 opponent sent him a grotesque diatribe comparing the family of murdered @entity6 to apes			1
@entity9 mp @entity15 has revealed that @entity3 , who stood for @entity11 in @entity16 at the 2010 general election , emailed mr @entity15 to ask if it was ‘ a joke ’ that @entity19 had received a peerage			1
mr @entity3 attached a tirade by a racist internet commentator , who wrote that the peerage made him ‘ ashamed to be @entity24 ’			1
shockingly , the commentator – who called himself ‘ @entity26 ’ – goes on to say : ‘ mrs @entity19 should be elevated higher than the indigenous @entity27 , which she would normally be , due to the preference of her species for dwelling in high places ’ – seemingly a reference to monkeys			0
‘ @entity26 ’ goes on to describe the peerage as ‘ treason ’ and says this ‘ latest ludicrous elevation of an ethnic - minority woman to baroness on the grounds of her being black with the distinction of having had a son murdered ( sic ) by white - men , is a crass injustice ’			0
@entity44 is a @entity46 term used to highlight an apparent mistake – indicating that ‘ @entity26 ’ does not believe that @entity6 ’s death counted as murder			0
after mr @entity15 told mr @entity3 that he was ‘ truly appalled ’ by the email , an unapologetic mr @entity3 replied that his nephew had been murdered ‘ by some foreigner ’ and claimed that the case remained ‘ unsolved ’ because the victim ’s mother was ‘ a white @entity24 citizen ’			1
mr @entity15 referred the email exchange to the police – who concluded that although the content was ‘ deeply unpleasant ’ it did not constitute a crime			1
last night mr @entity3 , 71 , confirmed he had been visited by @entity62 police a fortnight ago over the email			1
he said : ‘ i told them that i had forwarded the email and still agreed with it			0
murdered teenager @entity6 ( left ) and @entity19 ( right ) who were insulted in the racist e-mail by @entity3 ' as far as i ’m concerned we have freedom of speech in this country and i will say what i think			1
‘ i ’m not frightened to speak and say what other people are too frightened to say			0
i have black and @entity73 friends but i think it ’s wrong that people play the race card just to prove a point			0
‘ the police wanted to know who @entity26 was but i told them i had no idea and they said the case was closed as far as i was concerned			2
‘ i do n’t understand why the @entity6 case is still going on			0
it ’s been 21 years and it ’s time everyone moved on			0
that ’s why i sent it			0
i still agree with it			0
’ mr @entity3 claimed he did n’t agree with the ‘ monkey ’ reference , but still did not regret sending the email			2
he added that he had let his @entity11 membership ‘ lapse ’ a couple of years ago			1
the row comes just days after a damning report revealed the full extent of corruption by officers investigating @entity6 ’s death , including a police cover - up and a ‘ spying operation ’ on the grieving family by an undercover unit			2
@entity11 leader @entity106 has battled to contain a string of revelations about the views held by some of his candidates @entity6 , 18 , was stabbed to death by a group of up to six white youths in an unprovoked racist attack at a bus stop in @entity118 , @entity119 , on april 22 , 1993			1
baroness @entity19 fought back tears in the @entity121 last week as she reacted to the report by barrister @entity123			0
last night , a @entity11 spokesman said that mr @entity3 was no longer a member of the party			1
he added : ‘ @entity11 abhors racism and takes all allegations of racism extremely seriously			2
' @entity3 left @entity11 in 2012 after becoming unhappy about the direction of the party			1
’ mr @entity3 , who won more than 3,000 votes at the last election , was a member of the @entity132 for 33 years , switching to @entity11 when @entity133 became @entity132 leader			1
last night mr @entity15 told @entity135 : ‘ one only has to see the dignity with which @entity137 has reacted to this week ’s revelations to realise how much she deserved her place in the @entity121			2
‘ this exposes @entity11 for the narrow - minded bigots they really are			2
’ @entity11 leader @entity106 has battled to contain a string of revelations about the views held by some of his candidates			2
last week he pledged to weed out ‘ eccentric ’ candidates who have ‘ skeletons in their cupboards ’ , and said everyone who wanted to stand as an mp or an @entity153 would have to sign a charter to prove they are not extremists			0
as a result all new candidates now have to make a written declaration that they have ‘ never engaged in , advocated or condoned racist , violent , criminal or anti- democratic activity ’			0

ex-ukip candidate @entity3 sent racist diatribe to @entity9 mp @entity15
