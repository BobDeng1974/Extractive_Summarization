click here for your ultimate stats guide to the game , including @entity5 's winner after just nine minutes ! @entity6 dished out the rough stuff to @entity8 and @entity9 , but can claim the tactic was justified as @entity12 ’s men climbed to second in the @entity13 following captain @entity5 ’s shock winner			1
@entity8 , making his @entity16 debut after a £ 16million move from @entity18 , appeared to be targeted by @entity6 to try and make him lose his temper , particularly when @entity20 kicked him off the ball			1
substitute @entity22 was also the victim of a bad , late tackle from @entity23			0
but any collateral damage in public relations terms will hardly dampen @entity6 ’s spirits after @entity5 celebrated his new four - year contract with a goal poacher ’s effort after nine minutes			1
even though £ 25m @entity102 midfielder @entity68 and @entity103 reject @entity79 were making club debuts , one - man publicity machine @entity8 was predictably the centre of attention			2
@entity8 ’s name was cheered louder than anyone else ’s and a @entity9 lap - dancing club hired a plane to fly overhead and advertise their wares			1
being photographed outside such an establishment was one of @entity8 ’s many misdemeanours during his eventful spell at @entity117			1
even with golden boy @entity22 left on the bench following his @entity102 exertions and @entity120 out with a thigh injury picked up on international duty , @entity9 made a bright start with @entity65 attempting an ambitious volley from @entity63 ’s cross that flew just too high			1
but @entity6 were surprisingly adventurous to and there had already been a couple of panicky moments in the home defence when they struck			2
@entity81 ’s corner was met by the head of @entity20			0
@entity60 blocked unconvincingly and before he could have a second go at clearing , @entity5 nipped in to scoop the ball in from a prostrate position			2
it was the striker ’s second goal in consecutive games			2
@entity68 , who had signed from @entity138 early in the summer but sidelined by a knee injury until now , showed his frustration by going in late on @entity79 and collecting a booking			0
the @entity142 then vented their displeasure when lax @entity9 marking allowed @entity20 a free header from @entity81 ’s free - kick which he missed			1
as for @entity8 , he was quiet but certainly not anonymous , certainly not to the @entity6 antagonists			2
@entity84 claimed , unconvincingly , that @entity8 had dived after the @entity6 man had clipped him from behind			2
more seriously , the @entity148 hit the turf again when @entity20 kicked him in the calf while referee @entity95 was looking elsewhere			0
the @entity152 defender was trying to stop @entity8 running into the area and was lucky it went unseen			0
if @entity6 assistant @entity156 – never popular at @entity16 – had dared to appear in the technical area before he finally appeared to galvanise the troops in injury - time , you would imagine he ’d have been pleased with his centre - half			1
then , @entity23 caught @entity160 by the touchline , high on the thigh			0
it was to @entity8 ’s credit he kept his cool and even applauded @entity142 as he was substituted after a frustrating day			0
@entity37 gives @entity8 a pep talk before the match kicks off between @entity9 and @entity6 on saturday evening at @entity16 in the @entity13 @entity8 is chased by @entity81 ( right ) and @entity6 's new signing from @entity103 , @entity79 , during the @entity170 match @entity8 tries to escape the markings of @entity6 during the first half at @entity16 as @entity9 went in trailing 1 - 0 in the @entity170 clash @entity8 constantly found himself on the end of rough treatment from @entity20 at @entity16 as the @entity6 defender kept the striker quiet @entity30 was n't looking happy during the 1 - 0 loss to @entity6 at @entity16 - @entity9 's second defeat of the still - young @entity13 season @entity68 in action for @entity9 after signing from @entity138 during the summer transfer window and he is chased by @entity6 's own new boy @entity79 @entity68 on the ball for @entity9 after signing from @entity138 during the summer transfer window and he was later substituted for @entity22 mins @entity185 @entity9 total 114.95 71.4 @entity67 90 11.92 7.4 @entity64 90 11.84 7.3 @entity37 90 11.10 6.9 @entity6 total 113.78 70.7 @entity81 90 12.33 7.6 @entity82 90 11.79 7.3 @entity86 90 10.97 6.8 data courtesy of the @entity187 , the @entity188 of the @entity13 the only piece of real link - up play between him and @entity68 in the no 10 role came when @entity8 laid off and @entity68 hit a rising half - volley wide with @entity76 well beaten			1
@entity8 ’s only other moment was a spectacular solo strike that was deflected for a corner after he ’d been brilliantly picked out by @entity37			0
following an insipid start to the second - half , @entity30 succumbed to the temptation of throwing on @entity22 after an hour even though he ideally wanted him rested for tuesday ’s @entity201 opener against @entity202			0
within seconds he turned on the turbo ’s to reach @entity67 ’s pass and was flattened by a late tackle by @entity23 , who was booked			0
it says a lot for 19 - year - old @entity22 ’s ability how quickly @entity9 now regard him as the go - to man following @entity210 ’s departure			1
he was joined by fellow subs @entity213 and @entity66 for the last 20 minutes , a remarkable turnaround for @entity66 who rejected moves to @entity217 and @entity218 on transfer deadline day			0
it was @entity67 who came closest to proving an equaliser though			0
he twisted his way to the edge of the @entity6 penalty area before hitting a strike against the post with @entity76 rooted to the spot			2
ultimately though , on a day of great expectation on @entity231 , it was the underdogs who were able to celebrate as they maintained their unbeaten league start to the season , achieved without star defender @entity237			0
last week , the film ‘ one night in @entity241 ’ about @entity9 ’s legendary 2005 @entity240 win was premiered to great acclaim in the city			1
@entity22 had about 30 minutes to make an impact after coming on as a substitute in the place of @entity68 on saturday evening in the @entity13 one of @entity22 's first contributions once he 'd arrived on the @entity16 pitch as a substitute was to be flattened by @entity23 in this crunching challenge @entity22 was sent in a spiral by @entity23 's challenge at @entity16 , which warranted a yellow card from referee @entity95 on saturday evening @entity22 chases the ball but the substitute , who had 30 minutes to make an impact , failed to help @entity9 equalise against @entity6 @entity9 midfielder @entity37 looks dejected during the 1 - 0 defeat to @entity6 at @entity16 as the captain tasted a loss for the second time this season @entity6 celebrate their shock 1 - 0 win at @entity16 over @entity9 after @entity5 , who signed a new four - year contract this week , scored the winner @entity30 is hoping to inspire @entity9 to another @entity13 title charge after finishing runner up to @entity117 last year @entity120 was unable to take part in the @entity13 match due to injury and @entity9 manager @entity30 missed his main goalscoring threat @entity9 's key striker @entity120 was unable to take part in the @entity13 match due to injury and @entity30 missed his main goalscorer click here for all facts , stats and graphics from the big match , including @entity5 's simple finish to gift @entity6 the lead ! @entity5 scored the winner after just nine minutes - you can see this and more in @entity288 's brilliant match zone service by clicking here !			1
