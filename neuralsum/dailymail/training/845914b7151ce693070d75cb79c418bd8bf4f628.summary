by @entity0 former elite referee @entity1 is expected to leave @entity2 at the end of the season following the failed experiment of having an ex-official in the gantry alongside the match commentator			2
however , @entity1 's demise also follows a serious falling - out with his former employers at the @entity12 after he criticised refereeing standards and called for the head of @entity12 boss @entity15 in a newspaper article			1
after @entity1 ’s incendiary comments were published , @entity2 allegedly reacted to huge pressure from the @entity19 by taking him off their live coverage			2
promises from the network at the time that he would stay fully involved in other football programming have not materialised			0
he 's off : @entity1 is set to be ditched as a football co-commentator by @entity2 on the pitch : @entity1 , in his former career as a ref , shows @entity31 's @entity30 ( second left ) a red card during the @entity19 match against @entity34 at @entity35 in september 2012 @entity36 : ( left - right ) @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 in the studio and it ’s believed that @entity1 , who has remained on the @entity36 payroll , will be quietly paid off in june , the station not wanting to further antagonise the @entity19 with the next tv rights tender possibly starting in november			1
a @entity36 spokesman said : ‘ @entity1 is a regular contributor , ’ although the controversial referee has not been seen on screen since last december			1
the @entity19 have repeatedly insisted they have not interfered in @entity36 ’s use of @entity1			1
yet the 52 - year - old sent an email to his lawyers at @entity54 ’s @entity53 that read : ‘ @entity55 ( @entity19 chief executive ) rang @entity56 , the head man of @entity36 , demanding they sack me			1
i received a phone call from @entity59 ( @entity36 football chief ) telling me i had been stood down due to the article			2
’ the @entity63 ’s initiative of having the @entity65 team bond with supporters will see the players walk through the packed @entity69 west car park on saturday rather than take the team bus all the way into the stadium			1
and fliers will be handed out at the railway station publicising the 2.30pm arrival of the team coach ahead of the @entity78 game			0
yet they still want to keep the long walk informal by not announcing the players ’ names as they leave the bus , as @entity84 do at the @entity85			0
in training : ( left - right ) @entity65 's @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 there could be another twist to the provocative decision by @entity95 to ask @entity65 outcast @entity96 to play in their bicentenary showcase match against the @entity99 at @entity100 on july 5			1
the only previous occasion on which @entity96 played for @entity95 was in the 2004 game against champion county @entity103 , when the @entity105 ’s team was captained by @entity106 and included @entity107 - his two arch - critics			2
that memory might be enough for @entity96 to decline his invitation			0
@entity111 : @entity96 and his wife @entity112 were at the @entity114 ceremony on wednesday @entity116 manager @entity115 has been offered a @entity119 pundits ’ gig at the @entity120 despite the troubles with his struggling @entity19 side			1
another manager under siege , @entity34 ’s @entity123 , has not committed to media overtures to work in @entity126 knowing it would not impress fans who will expect him to be scouting full - time for players			0
radio ga ga : @entity116 manager @entity115 has been offered a summer job on @entity119 @entity135 agent riddle no proper explanation was given by axed @entity138 manager @entity137 at his @entity140 press conference this week as to whether his close ties with @entity143 agent @entity142 played any part in his exit			1
but certainly @entity138 insiders believe @entity137 ’s loyalty to long - time adviser @entity142 - whom @entity138 chairman @entity147 refused to involve in transfer dealings - contributed significantly to the split			1
@entity142 said on thursday : ‘ people can say what they want but @entity38 does n’t think it was anything to do with me and nor do i. we ’re moving on , the past is the past			0
’ * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * @entity159 ’s cluttered sponsorships makes a scrap among bookmakers keen to maximise publicity for their races inevitable			0
the first day has the biggest potential for a bust - up , with @entity167 somehow allocating sponsorship rights to both @entity169 and @entity170			2
and that ’s before ambush marketing specialists @entity173 seek to hijack attention			0
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * there is much anticipation as to how @entity177 , @entity179 ’s new loan signing from @entity180 , and @entity181 will rub along in the @entity183 dressing room			0
however , while @entity181 is never short of an opinion whatever the subject , @entity177 is said to be quiet and unassuming , though he did stand up for himself at @entity186 concerning his own management representation			0
combustible ? @entity177 ( right ) and @entity181 during a training session with @entity179 this week			0

@entity1 set to lose role as football co-commentator at @entity36
former referee had bust - up with officials ' ruling body @entity12
@entity19 alleged to have forced @entity1 's removal
@entity65 rugby team set for @entity69 walk through fans
another twist is possible in @entity96 's @entity65 saga
@entity115 offered pundit 's job on @entity119
@entity137 's loyalty to his agent could be behind @entity138 exit
