@entity1 manager @entity0 praised the composure of his young players in the heat of a @entity6 derby which never really fully ignited at @entity7			1
the visitors hit the post through 19 - year - old @entity10 , on only his second @entity12 start , but that was the closest either side came			1
@entity14 did not register a shot on target until the 86th minute when @entity17 forced @entity18 to save			1
@entity10 dribbles with the ball while being tracked by @entity21 forward @entity20 @entity14 's @entity22 puts in a tackle on @entity10 during the first half at @entity7 @entity10 could be part of a very bright future for @entity1 under @entity0 @entity10 was named man of the match , which justified @entity0 ' decision to last month bring him back from a loan spell at @entity31			1
' i have been just waiting to put him in			1
i called him back because i thought now he can really contribute , ' he said			1
' he had a great spell on loan , which is what you want from your young players , and he had a good time at a good club but it was time for him to come back and feature			1
' i had no qualms about putting him in			1
it was a brilliant performance by him , he was unfortunate not to have scored with his run and strike			2
' he has wonderful temperament and technique and is tactically very good for a kid coming into that system			2
i am very pleased for him			2
' what was decent was in such an intense atmosphere the composure of the young players			2
' @entity54 , he was like a @entity55 at the back at 21 and he defended fantastically			2
' @entity10 and the rest showed great composure			1
they connected the game really well and we now have got a real solid structure defensively and 86 minutes was ( @entity14 's ) first shot on target			2
' @entity54 , pictured with three @entity14 players , looked assured during his first @entity6 derby the downside was the early loss of midfielder @entity69 to a thigh problem , which is likely to keep the @entity72 out for a while			1
@entity14 had their own injury issues to deal with prior to kick - off with left back @entity75 failing a fitness test on a knee injury and winger @entity78 likely to be out for longer after sustaining bruising on a bone in his knee			0
' it was a bit of a disappointment			0
he ( @entity86 ) did n't want to miss the game for any money in the world but the knee would n't settle , ' said @entity14 boss @entity91			0
' he was n't 100 per cent to play			0
i do n't know about wednesday ( against @entity93 )			0
i do n't think it is a long - term problem			0
' @entity78 got a knock in training and has a bruised bone in his knee and he will be longer			0
' @entity14 left back @entity75 missed the @entity6 derby due to a knee injury @entity91 felt his side handled a technical game well			1
' it became a fascinating game , tactically , two asymmetric shapes that would allow some space , ' he added			0
' there were n't many open chances ; @entity1 hit the post in the first half from long range and @entity113 's overhead kick , that was all			1
' we were in good positions in the first half but could n't find the composure or final pass but when @entity17 got into the penalty late in the second half you thought that was the moment			0
' i thought the tempo and intensity of the sides was typical of a @entity6 derby			1
@entity129 puts his jacket back on after @entity91 changed his mind regarding a substitution ' we got a very important clean sheet and another strong performance that will allow us to become more confident on the ball and get that arrogance with our play			0
' the @entity138 defended his handling of @entity129 , who was set to come on five minutes before half - time but did not get on until five minutes from the end			0
' @entity142 had a really nasty fall , his neck got twisted and the doctor was concerned but we felt he could carry on until half - time , ' he said			0
' he did n't want to come off , @entity148 was carrying a bit of a niggle , @entity147 was coming back ( from injury ) , @entity146 was on nine bookings so i had to make sure i did n't use a substitution cheaply			0
' @entity129 was desperate to come on but @entity155 was desperate not to come off and it was the right call medically			0

@entity0 reserved *special* praise for the @entity1 *starlets*
@entity1 *claimed* point in @entity6 derby at @entity7
@entity10 was recalled to @entity164 after impressing for @entity31
