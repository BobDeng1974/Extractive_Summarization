by @entity0 playing cards and draughts and doing crossword puzzles could help stave off alzheimer 's disease , scientists say			1
new research shows brain - stimulating activities could help to preserve vulnerable structures and cognitive functions in regions of the brain involved in the disease			1
research suggests people who spend more time playing these games are also more likely to perform better in learning , memory and information processing tests			0
scientists say brain - stimulating activities , such as doing a crossword , could help to preserve vulnerable brain structures and cognitive functions in regions of the brain involved in @entity25 's disease but charity @entity26 said that the study - while ' useful for identifying factors that may influence our risk of memory decline ' - does not confirm whether or not playing such games actively prevents the condition			1
as part of the study , scientists from the @entity34 and the @entity35 in the @entity36 performed a series of tests on 329 people with an average age of 60			2
those taking part were healthy but deemed to be at a higher risk of alzheimer 's disease due to their genetic background or family history			0
as well as giving them brain scans , scientists also asked the participants how often they took part in activities such as reading books , going to museums and playing card games or doing puzzles			2
the researchers , who presented their findings to the @entity58 in @entity59 , found those who reported playing games were more likely to have a greater brain volume			1
they also scored higher on cognitive tests			2
the researchers concluded that , for some individuals , participating in such games could help prevent alzheimer 's disease			0
the researchers from the @entity34 and the @entity35 in the @entity66 those who reported playing games were more likely to have a greater brain volume and scored higher on cognitive tests , which could prevent the disease dr @entity73 , science communications manager at @entity26 , said : ' observational studies like this are not able to pinpoint cause and effect , but they can be useful for identifying factors that may influence our risk of memory decline and dementia			1
' previous evidence has suggested that keeping the brain active may help boost ' cognitive reserve ' , allowing the brain to resist damage for longer , and this study adds to the ongoing ' use it or lose it ' debate			0
' it 's important to note that the people in this study did not have dementia , and we ca n't say from these results that playing card games , reading books or doing crosswords will prevent the condition			2
' the best evidence suggests that we can reduce our risk of dementia with a healthy lifestyle - eating a balanced , healthy diet , exercising regularly , not smoking , and keeping blood pressure and weight in check			0
' dr @entity107 , director of research and development at the @entity110 charity , added : ' this research shows an interesting association between the size of certain brain areas , memory performance and time spent challenging the brain with games and puzzles			0
' however , it does n't tell us that playing mind - stimulating games can cause positive changes in brain volume or memory - this needs to be tested in longer term studies or clinical trials			1
' although there is no harm in playing games and puzzles , research shows that the best steps you can take to reduce your risk of developing dementia is taking regular exercise , eating a healthy balanced diet , not smoking and keeping cholesterol and blood pressure under control			0

brain - stimulating activities can preserve cognitive functions , scientists say
those who played cards , draughts and crosswords had greater brain volume
@entity26 said tests do not prove puzzles prevent condition
