by @entity0 published : 11:13 est , 7 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:26 est , 7 february 2014 a defiant father is refusing to leave the £ 1million house he built himself despite being completely surrounded by fields of muddy floodwater on the @entity7			1
builder @entity8 , 40 , has kept the house in @entity11 safe from the rising floodwater by building his own flood defences which consist of a five - foot deep moat around his house , brick waterproofing and a pump system			1
he insisted his partner and their two young children left in case the defences breached , but @entity8 refused to evacuate despite the impending storm and inevitable deluge			1
an @entity26 's home : @entity8 built his own flood defences to protect his four - bedroom home in @entity11 , @entity28 marooned : @entity8 is keeping his house dry by using a moat , water - proofing and a pump system			1
he built the house himself four years ago mr @entity8 spent around £ 1million building his four - bedroom detached home from scratch and moved into it just two - and - a - half years ago			1
the home sits on a four - acre plot which is the highest point in @entity41 house was built on a spot which according to records had never previously flooded - and mr @entity8 is determined to maintain the record			1
the flood water is currently 2ft away from the top of the barrier and any water which breaches his blockade is quickly pumped back out of the house			1
he has also wrapped the bottom of his house in polythene in an attempt to stop any rainwater soaking through the bricks			2
the father - of - two is using diggers to make sure the defences remain firm under the mounting pressure mr @entity8 looks out onto the flooded scene outside his home in @entity65 mr @entity8 said : ' all around the house is completely flooded but because we 've built a band around it we 've managed to stop it actually coming into the house			1
' if we had n't have put the band around the house it would be completely flooded now			2
' as it stands the barrier we 've built is about 2ft higher than the water , so that 's how much more we 're hoping it 'll take			1
' obviously it might collapse if the pressure of the water gets too much			2
for about three days solid we 've been pumping water out with two big pumps and stopping it from getting in			1
i 'm determined to stay here and look after it			0
' i wo n't be able to get out of here now anyway - the water all around the house is up to my waist			1
' we ca n't even get up and down the drive			0
i 've got to stay here			0
i need to man the pumps anyway			1
' @entity8 stands defiant in the land surrounding his £ 1million home on the @entity7 a friend in need : mr @entity8 's neighbours have delivered food to the home and helped keep the water at bay mr @entity8 's partner @entity102 , 31 , and their two children , who are 18 - months - old and 20 - weeks - old , left the house on tuesday			1
he added : ' my friend came out last night on his boat and delivered me some food			0
it 's a disaster area around here			0
' rescuers waded through waist deep water at 2am to knock on the door and tell me to leave			2
' i told them i was n't going and they just shook my hand and said fair play , good luck			0
' @entity8 brought his land with @entity102 nearly four years ago			1
knowing that the area was vulnerable to flooding they ensured the house was built as high as the @entity121 would allow - much higher than any recorded flood			1
in spite of this their house is now completely surrounded by water 3ft deep in the lowest points and 8ft deep in other areas			1
out on top : the builder 's planning has saved him the heartache of the floods - as more rain and winds are predicted for tonight head and shoulders above the rest : a view of @entity8 's house ( centre , right ) on the edge of the village of @entity11 which was evacuated last night when flood water rose a further metre mr @entity8 added : ' we brought the land four years ago			1
when we brought it we were sure that it would be safe from flooding			2
' the land around here has always been managed well to prevent flooding			1
we brought it and knocked the old farm house here down and started again			1
' we spent about £ 1 million on the house - buying the land and then actually building and decorating the house			1
it took us about 18 months , then we moved in			0
' just to be on the safe side we made sure we built the house higher than the highest recorded flood			1
ironically we wanted to build it higher than we did but the @entity121 would n't allow it			0
the water level is higher than ever at the moment and that 's how the house has ended up at risk			1
' we all know it 's called " @entity11 " but it 's not meant to flood like this			2
all four of my acres are under water now			2
another thing that 's upsetting is how much this will have devalued the house - if we want to ever sell it now we 'll struggle			1
' the builder 's planning has saved him from some of the most destructive weather the @entity186 has encountered in years			2
but the torrential rain and powerful winds is far from over			0
helping hand : @entity8 's friend drives one of the builder 's diggers at the property friends have delivered supplies to the property while mr @entity8 desperately tries to defy the elements @entity8 is the last man standing in flooded @entity65 - after creating improvised flood defences around his home winds of 80mph and heavy rain will sweep in from the @entity204 tomorrow , in what forecasters say could be the worst of the dramatic weather so far this winter			1
flooded areas and sea defences weakened by earlier storms will be bombarded once more			2
yet again , the worst hit will be the @entity214 , where coastal homes and businesses have been severely damaged			0
the flooded @entity7 meanwhile , where hamlets have been turned into ' ghost villages ' after homes were evacuated due to rising flood waters , is also expecting a new deluge of torrential rain			2
@entity223 who had been in the region building sandbag defences were drafted in to assist with the evacuation of residents in the village of @entity11 this morning			2
two weather systems are on course to collide in the coming days , bringing more than an inch of rain to some areas			0
the warning came as prime minister @entity235 faced growing pressure over the floods			0
communities secretary @entity238 last night said an extra £ 130million was needed for emergency repairs and clean up			0
he criticised the @entity121 , saying its chairman , @entity242 peer @entity240 , was wrong to suggest the countryside would have to be sacrificed to protect urban areas			0
‘ we will work to defend both town and country , ’ mr @entity238 said			2
lord @entity240 has faced criticism for the quango ’s decision to stop dredging rivers in flood - prone areas			2
after claiming that @entity186 must choose between saving ‘ the town or country ’ , he is sure of a vocal welcome from locals , many of whom have called for him to resign			0
@entity259 , pictured right , also known as @entity259 , lived between 985 and 1035			0
although @entity261 he was @entity262 , @entity26 , @entity263 and @entity264 at the same time			0
@entity259 's claim to the throne of @entity26 was initially rejected by this country 's noblemen so he returned home			0
there raised an army of more than 10,000 men and in 1016 launched an invasion force that sailed up the @entity274			0
according to legend he believed himself to be so powerful his command could hold back the tide			0
he tested this theory by having his throne placed on the shore where he vainly tried to command the tides back until he nearly drowned			0
however , some historians argue the demonstration was proof of his wisdom in showing courtiers he was not taken in by their flattery			0
after his death @entity259 was buried in the @entity289 at @entity290			0
however , during the @entity292 , his coffin was among those smashed by parliamentarian soldiers and his bones scattered			0
his bones remain at @entity296 but are intermingled with those of other deceased @entity26 kings .			0

builder @entity8 bought the land and started building his house four years ago with his partner @entity102
the four bedroom house has only escaped flooding because mr @entity8 built his own flood defences
the defences *include* a moat , waterproofing and a pump system which is pushing water back out onto *farmland*
the father - of - two has refused to evacuate his *beloved* home , saying ' someone has to man the pumps '
