by @entity0 published : 03:15 est , 21 august 2012 @entity2 : 05:31 est , 21 august 2012 the traditional image of the birth of the universe suggests that all matter sparked into existence in a cataclysmic @entity7 more than 13 billion years ago			1
but this model is now being challenged by a theory which suggests the universe froze its way into existence in what has been deemed a ' @entity14 '			1
theoretical physicists at the @entity16 said the best metaphor for the start of the universe should be considered as water freezing into ice			1
in this theory , the three spatial dimensions and the one dimension of time ' froze ' into place - and the physicists suggest we could learn about the ' cracks in time and space ' by investigating the natural cracks in ice particles			1
the @entity14 : physicists from the @entity16 suggest we view the universe and the four known dimensions as ' freezing ' their way into existence the eternal spark : the traditional view of the universe creation is the @entity7 , when matter burst into existence they say our understanding of the nature of the @entity46 could be revolutionised by investigating the cracks and crevices common to ice crystals			1
lead researcher on the project , @entity50 said current theorising is the latest in a long quest by humans to understand the origins and nature of the @entity46			2
he said : ' @entity59 philosophers wondered what matter was made of : was it made of a continuous substance or was it made of individual atoms ? ' with very powerful microscopes , we now know that matter is made of atoms			0
' thousands of years later , @entity67 assumed that space and time were continuous and flowed smoothly , but we now believe that this assumption may not be valid at very small scales			1
' he added : ' a new theory , known as @entity74 , suggests that space may be made up of indivisible building blocks , like tiny atoms			1
there are many theories as to how the universe formed			2
the @entity7 - which suggests that all the matter in the universe exploded from a single dense point - is the most popular model			2
there are differing schools of thought about how this type of universe will end			0
will it continue expanding forever , eventually dying a cold death as the stars burn out ? alternatively the universe could stretch and ' bounce back ' into a single point , leading to an endless cycle of universes contracting and expanding			0
or the universe may be eternal - known as the ' steady state ' theory which suggests there is no beginning or no end			1
other popular theories suggest we could be part of a multiverse - one of many universes connected together , each with slightly different physical properties , or simply that the universe is a hologram or computer simulation			2
' these indivisible blocks can be thought about as similar to pixels that make up an image on a screen			0
' the challenge has been that these building blocks of space are very small , and so impossible to see directly			0
' however @entity50 and his colleagues believe they may have figured out a way to see them indirectly			0
he said : ' think of the early universe as being like a liquid			0
' then as the universe cools , it " crystallises " into the three spatial and one time dimension that we see today			1
' theorised this way , as the @entity46 cools , we would expect that cracks should form , similar to the way cracks are formed when water freezes into ice			2
' @entity134 research team member associate professor @entity133 said some of these defects might be visible			0
' @entity137 and other particles would bend or reflect off such defects , and therefore in theory we should be able to detect these effects , ' he said			0
the team has calculated some of these effects and if their predictions are experimentally verified , the question as to whether space is smooth or constructed out of tiny indivisible parts will be solved once and for all .			0

@entity16 suggest theory could ' revolutionise ' our understanding of the universe
theory suggests the universe moved from a ' fluid ' state to a fixed state of three spatial directions
investigating ice crystals could lead to understanding of ' cracks ' in time and space
