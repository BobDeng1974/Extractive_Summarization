dr. @entity12 and @entity13 were less dedicated to @entity15 's welfare than their own , says a lawsuit filed on thursday			1
a public administrator 's office , a local government entity , represents the estate of @entity22 , whose father was a @entity25 copper baron and founded @entity26			1
gracious : @entity15 was shy , but not sad			0
her friends and the few relatives who knew her describe her as cheerful , gracious , stubborn , and devoted to her art. she poses at about age 37 ' @entity13 abandoned its duties and responsibilities when it learned that a very rich patient was in its eye , ' and @entity12 ' placed his own interests above those of his patient , ' the lawsuit says			1
@entity12 's lawyer , @entity40 , called the lawsuit ' outrageous '			1
the hospital 's lawyer , @entity42 , declined to comment			0
@entity22 died at @entity13 at age 104 in 2011 , leaving no close relatives and a roughly $ 300 million estate			1
she had glorious homes in @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 but had lived in the hospital since 1991 , though she did n't need its care most of that time			0
distant relations raised concerns about gifts @entity22 had lavished on those around her , including more than $ 4million to the hospital , more than $ 800,000 to @entity12 and his family and about $ 31 million to her main private - duty nurse , court papers say			1
the nurse is n't among those being sued in the newly filed case			0
the questions deepened as it emerged that @entity22 had signed two very different wills within six weeks in 2005			0
the first mainly benefited her distant kin ; the second cut them out			0
a september settlement in the will fight largely benefited arts charities and the relatives			0
it left a door open to further court action over gifts doled out during @entity22 's life			2
family of fortune : ms @entity15 , right , as a child in 1917 with her wealthy father and her sister @entity84 the new lawsuit says the hospital and @entity12 let @entity22 stay - violating regulations that require discharging patients once they no longer need treatment - to extract presents from her			1
it also faults @entity12 for not having @entity22 undergo psychiatric evaluation and says he and others violated hospital policies against employees accepting personal gifts			2
the hospital , @entity12 and others who tended to @entity22 have long maintained she was mentally sharp , if eccentric , and lived and gave as she desired			2
@entity12 was unaware of any gift policy , was n't a hospital employee part of the time in question and provided care that helped @entity22 live as she chose , his lawyer said thursday			2
" the concept that dr. @entity12 did something improper , in any way whatsoever , is absolutely absurd , " @entity40 said			0
any money recovered would be split among @entity115 ' relatives and arts institutions			0
