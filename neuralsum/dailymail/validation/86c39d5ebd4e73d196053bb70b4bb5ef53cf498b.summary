host commentator @entity1 : the club need to be supportive off the field , to create an environment so that his family can settle in the north west and enjoy their life in @entity8			1
his wife wants to leave the country and return to @entity11 , and @entity13 is wrestling with that decision : let her leave with the children and leave him to continue his @entity18 career , or move to another club more suited to their lifestyle in @entity21			1
click here to read @entity1 's full player ratings from @entity24 @entity1 : without a doubt			1
he looked the business with his great @entity29 team in the @entity30 and he has an excellent record in @entity21 football			2
the problem is that he has under - estimated some of the demands and the customs of @entity37 football , such as the @entity39 defeat at @entity40 and the failure to inspire the supporters at @entity24			1
he claimed @entity18 would be stronger in the second half of the season			2
they actually look disillusioned and directionless			0
i was surprised that @entity47 did not build from the back when he arrived , buying top class defenders ( although i like @entity50 ) to make sure @entity18 would be difficult to beat			1
everybody with a passing interest in the club knew that they would need defensive reinforcements after @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 left			0
the task of rescuing @entity18 and turning them into a formidable attacking presence again was bigger than he thought , possibly too big			2
@entity1 : not a lot , but at the pressure moment of the game he delivered			2
he spotted the back pass , the opportunity to take @entity68 into the @entity69 semi-final at @entity71 if he could take advantage inside a stadium where he has only ever known what it is like to play in red			1
to finish the way he did , clipping the ball around the advancing figure of @entity80 , was a moment of composure and genuine class			0
click here to read @entity1 's full player ratings from @entity24 @entity1 : absolutely right			1
@entity47 was dismissive of him when he decided to sell , claiming that he was not of the standard required for his new @entity18 team			2
he had been fairly anonymous until his goal , but he took it brilliantly			0
when he was substituted he showed respect for his surroundings by clapping all four corners of the stadium			0
you know in his heart of hearts he would still like to be a @entity18 player , but the decision was taken away from him			1
@entity1 : history is on @entity68 ’s side because they have won the trophy five times under @entity103			1
if @entity105 reach the final then it will be difficult for them to deviate from the narrative about it being a fitting send off for the captain @entity109 before his move to @entity111			2
the reality is that it would be a distraction , particularly for a team that has n't won the competition since 2006			0
having said that , @entity109 ’s contribution to the 2006 fa cup final against @entity119 was superhuman			0
you could not rule out something special			0
@entity1 : @entity18 measure their seasons on silverware , not top four finishes			1
at the moment they are making up the numbers , trying to work out where they are heading under a manager who appears uncertain of his own values			0
@entity47 is becoming increasingly tetchy and his response on monday evening , sarcastically batting away questions , is a sure sign that he is under pressure			0
finishing in the top four would be an achievement , nothing more			0
to win a sixth @entity69 under one manager would be impressive , but @entity103 wants another crack at the @entity141 title before he calls it quits at the @entity142			1
to do that he will need a better squad , not team , than @entity144 and @entity145			0
as good as @entity68 look at times , they do not have the muscular presence and stature of @entity144			2
@entity1 : a quiet word is needed because @entity37 football frowns upon it			1
i do actually have sympathy in some instances because i ’m sure that a lot of players throw themselves to the floor to avoid robust challenges in situations where they think they might get injured or seriously hurt by an opposition player			0
@entity164 is a case in point , because he had a terrible reputation for diving when he was at @entity169			0
@entity1 : he has added a protective force in the shape of @entity172 , an unexpected bonus after he was sent out on loan to @entity175			2
he has made the grade because he has finally listened to the coaches who told him that he could have a career in the position , provided he sacrificed his initial preference to be more extravagant on the ball			0
the big test is whether he can get the better of @entity183 in the big games with @entity144			0
if he ca n’t get to grips with him then they will be second best again next season			0
@entity1 : it was a bizarre decision to substitute two players at half - time because @entity18 were in the ascendency after @entity192 scored the equaliser			1
after the game @entity103 even conceded that his players had been demoralised at half - time because they felt they did not deserve to have been pegged back			0
@entity47 should have persisted for a little while longer , but the changes disrupted the team ’s rhythm			0
it felt like a big mistake at the time and an even bigger one when @entity68 scored the winner			2
@entity1 : i am not sure he has a philosophy because he urges caution and does not want to play with risk , and yet he makes two huge gambles at half - time with his substitutions			1
everybody can bring in players , but has he really identified the players who can turn @entity18 in to a team capable of challenging for the top four ? patience is beginning to wear thin			2
