a @entity1 artist has come up with a novel way of fixing the city 's pothole problem by turning them into mosaic works of art. @entity8 has transformed the holes in the road starting within his own neighbourhood in @entity12 by not only filling them in but making them a work of art. he began his project in the summer of last year and uses the flag of the city of @entity1 as the inspiration for his creations			1
@entity8 scrapes away the cement to reveal his finished mosaic on a filled pothole in a @entity1 street mr @entity8 cones off the areas he works at using cones belonging to his sons , which they use for soccer practice the artist puts fake serial numbers on the mosaics as a way of highlighting the severity of @entity1 's pothole problem he also leaves a fake serial number on the mosaic as a humorous way of pointing out the severity of the pothole problem in the city			1
the artist told @entity42 : ' it 's a way to say , " this is a @entity1 pothole ! ” ' the fake serial numbers are a joke , a comment on the number of potholes there actually are in @entity1 , ' mr @entity8 added			1
