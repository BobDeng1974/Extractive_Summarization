it is one of the most recognisable and popular of all instruments , and yet its design has remained almost unchanged for 100 years			2
but now @entity6 musician @entity5 claims to have reinvented the grand piano after spending 8,000 hours and almost £ 1million building his own in a workshop in @entity10			1
with its edgy design , finished entirely in glossy black paint , music fans have dubbed the creation the @entity16 - for its resemblance to the @entity19			0
almost every single one of the instrument 's 18,000 components has been redesigned			2
rather than the traditional three legs , the @entity5 has only two , and both of them have been carefully shaped to help project the sound into the auditorium			1
he had also reinvented the key mechanism , meaning it applies only the slightest pressure to the soundboard - the anchor of the piano to which everything else is fixed			2
the board itself , instead of being made from the traditional wood , is made from more than 20 carbon composite layers woven one on top of the other			1
@entity5 , 41 , a feted concert pianist who has spent more than a decade building the instrument in a workshop above a disused communist - era factory , is optimistic about the results			1
he said : ' what we created will enrich piano history			0
it is said that old pianos sound friendly , velvety , while new ones are stronger and more powerful			0
i was hoping for both			0
' the piano traces its history back to the dulcimer , an instrument made of strings stretched across a board played with hand - held hammers , which was invented in @entity84 shortly after the birth of @entity86			1
however , the first modern piano was created by @entity89 di @entity88 in @entity90 , @entity91 , in 1709 and was called gravicembalo col piano e forte - which roughly translates as ' harpsichord with soft and loud '			0
@entity5 won his first music prize at the age of six , and has gone on to play as a soloist in some of the most critically acclaimed orchestras in the world , including the @entity99 in 2004 @entity5 says that , unlike other modern redesigns such as though sponsored by @entity101 and @entity102 , his was focused entirely on the sound , rather than the appearance following a premiere concert in @entity10 on wednesday this week , the piano will go on sale later this year			1
@entity5 does not know how much it will cost yet , but says ' it will be expensive ' it was designed to improve upon the harpsichord , the favoured instrument of @entity113 and @entity114 , which produced notes by plucking at strings , rather than striking them			1
the plucking action meant that the harpsichord was only capable of producing one flat tone , while the piano 's hammer action meant the tone varied depending on how hard the key was struck			0
during the late 18th century , around the time @entity125 was playing , craftsmen added more keys to the instrument , as well as the first pedals to dampen or sustain notes			0
the suit the new styles of playing , the hammers were made heavier , and the strings stronger , producing a powerful new sound			1
makers also experimented with upright versions , with the strings stretched vertically in front of the player , and square grand pianos			0
the last great period of invention came in the mid to late 1800s , when @entity40 developed their grand piano , and added a third pedal underneath			1
but now @entity5 , who won his first music prize aged six and performs as a soloist in acclaimed orchestras such as the @entity99 , is hoping to add to that history with his latest version			1
he says the new instrument is based on innovations dreamed up , but not widely used , by 19th - century @entity6 piano makers			2
the instrument 's soundboard , the central fitting to which all other parts are fixed , has been refashioned out of 20 layers of carbon composite woven together giving the piano a lighter , airier sound jazz pianist @entity161 described playing the new piano as like being ' in a spaceship , like you are hovering above gravity ( pictured , @entity5 plays the piano in his workshop ) @entity5 and his design team are pictured with the new piano in their workshop in @entity172 and it seems that it could have been worth the wait as expert piano players agreed that the sound it produces is entirely new			1
@entity178 , ceo of @entity181 piano repair shop @entity179 , was ' mesmerized at the sound he said brought lyrical qualities back to the piano after a century of power - focused development			2
he said : ' in this design you will be able to hear the 1850 - 1860 era qualities , lyrical , bell - like , precise – and also the modern instrument that our time is used to , which is clarity			0
' four - time @entity195 - nominated jazz pianist @entity161 said he felt he had played a slick new type of instrument			0
he added : ' the sound almost feels as if you 're in a bubble , it 's so clear			0
it feels like you are in a spaceship , like you are hovering above gravity			1
' when you play a lot of notes , or you play a chord , the sensation is different			0
' following a premiere in the @entity211 in @entity10 earlier this month , the piano will go on sale later this year			0
@entity5 does not know how much each one will cost yet , but he says ' with these materials it will not be cheap			2
