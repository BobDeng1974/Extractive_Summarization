being expected to do household chores is n't just a bug bear of modern women â€“ female neanderthals had a similar dilemma			1
a new study of @entity7 teeth has discovered that our ancient cousins required women to do typical household chores , while also expecting them to hunt alongside men			1
the study suggests women in the group were responsible for looking after furs and adjusting garments , while men had the task of improving stone tools			1
the @entity20 made the discovery after analysing 99 incisors and canine teeth of 19 @entity7 found in @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			1
pictured is one of the specimens used in the study scientists at @entity20 ( @entity20 ) in @entity32 analysed 99 incisors and canine teeth of 19 @entity7 found at sites in @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			1
the fossils in @entity24 dated back 100,000 years , in @entity25 50,000 years , and in @entity26 the ancient teeth were believed to be 44,000 years old			0
regardless of age , @entity7 had dental grooves			1
' this is due to the custom of these societies to use the mouth as a third hand , as in some current populations , for tasks such as preparing the furs or chopping meat , for instance , ' said @entity50 , @entity20 researcher			2
but the study found grooves present in the female fossils followed the same pattern , and were different to those found in male individuals			2
but the study found grooves present in the female fossils ( pictured ) followed the same pattern , and were different to those found in male individuals			2
' what we have now discovered is that the grooves detected in the teeth of adult women are longer than those found in adult men , ' said professor @entity50 in modern hunter - gatherer societies , women may have been responsible for the preparation of furs and the elaboration of @entity75 state that the retouching of the edges of stone tools seems to have been a male task			1
pictured is an illustration of how they used their mouths as hands ' what we have now discovered is that the grooves detected in the teeth of adult women are longer than those found in adult men , ' said professor @entity50			1
researchers believe @entity7 used their mouths as a third hand for tasks such as preparing the furs or chopping meat			1
in july , the biggest collection of ancient human fossils ever recovered lent weight to this theory			0
the collection reveals how @entity7 developed their distinctive teeth before their brains , using them as a third hand for holding objects			1
the study adds to theories that the @entity7 evolved their characteristic looks slowly , and intermittently , over hundreds of thousands of years			1
the ancient skulls , dating back 400,000 years , show @entity7 - like features in the face and teeth , while other parts of the skulls , including the brain case , resembled those of more primitive human ancestors			2
this suggests the earliest @entity7 used their jaws in a particular way for chewing as well as for holding objects			2
the discovery at the @entity120 site in @entity24 's @entity120 has allowed scientists to better understand pre-human evolution during the @entity123 period - a time in which the path of hominin evolution has been controversial and fiercely debated			0
' therefore we assume that the tasks performed were different '			0
the tiny nicks of the teeth enamel were also analysed			0
male individuals show a greater number of nicks in the enamel and dentin of the upper parts , while in female individuals these imperfections appear in the lower parts			0
it is still unclear which activities corresponded to women and which ones to men			0
however , the authors of the study note that , as in modern hunter - gatherer societies , women may have been responsible for the preparation of furs and the elaboration of garments			2
researchers state that the retouching of the edges of stone tools seems to have been a male task			0
@entity158 , @entity20 researcher at the @entity24 @entity159 , adds : ' we believe that the specialisation of labour by sex of the individuals was probably limited to a few tasks			0
' it is possible that both men and women participated equally in the hunting of big animals '			0
' the study of @entity7 has provided numerous discoveries in recent years , ' @entity171 adds			2
' we have moved from thinking of them as little evolved beings , to know that they took care of the sick persons , buried their deceased , ate seafood , and even had different physical features than expected : there were redhead individuals , and with light skin and eyes			0
' so far , we thought that the sexual division of labour was typical of sapiens societies , but apparently that 's not true '			0
@entity158 , @entity20 researcher at the @entity24 @entity159 , adds : ' we believe that the specialisation of labour by sex of the individuals was probably limited to a few tasks			0
' it is possible that both men and women participated equally in the hunting of big animals ' the study looked at the teeth of 19 individuals from three different sites in @entity197 , in @entity198 , @entity24 , @entity199 in @entity25 , and @entity200 in @entity26			1

this is according to a study of 99 @entity7 incisors and canine teeth
@entity7 often used their mouths as a third hand to complete tasks
the grooves and patterns in the teeth differed between men and women
it suggests women were responsible for tasks such as looking after fur
however , women were also expected to hunt alongside men to get food
