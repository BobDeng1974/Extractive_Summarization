cheaply available software will allow an electronic shadower to hear phone conversations , monitor emails , texts and social media messages , and even track the phone ’s whereabouts using gps tracking			1

some devices are easily available in @entity34 for less than £ 100 and software marketed in the @entity36 can be installed for less than £ 50			1
the @entity37 said yesterday in the aftermath of @entity39 – a time of year notorious for the high numbers of couples who break up : ‘ women leaving abusive relationships and seeking refuge will often unwittingly lead abusers to their location via mobile phones			0
‘ mobiles can track the victim if the phone is registered to the abuser , if they have access to the victim ’s @entity54 or @entity55 online account , or surveillance software or app has been put on the phone			1
’ @entity60 of the women ’s aid group told the @entity63 : ‘ we increasingly hear stories of abusers adding tracking software to phones , placing spyware on personal computers and using the internet to gather information about their partner			1
‘ however , in many cases the police are not trained to recognise and understand the impact of online abuse , including tracking , and action is rarely taken against abusers			0
’ a number of laws governing communications offences appear to criminalise men or women who put a spyware app on a partner or target ’s phone and overhear messages and calls without their permission			1
however one key piece of legislation , the @entity94 , sets the maximum penalty for spying offences as no more than a fine			0
one device that can be used for spying marketed in @entity34 by the @entity100 chain is the cell phone recon system , which provides software which can be installed on a target phone			1

this device should not be used for any other purpose			0
the software / device must not be installed without prior permission from the owner of the device			0
’ another easy - to - find system is the @entity151 , marketed from the @entity36 at under £ 45 a month under the slogan : ‘ their cell phone will tell you what they wo n’t			2
’ advertised as a way to find out if your husband or wife is cheating , the system will , once installed on a spouse ’s phone , allow you to ‘ know for sure what your partner is really feeling , saying and doing when you are not there , ’ promoters say			2
the @entity94 makes it an offence ‘ to knowingly or recklessly obtain , disclose or procure the disclosure of personal information without the consent of the data controller			0
’ however the punishment for offences is no more than a fine			0
a number of other laws may cover spyware , among them the @entity182 , 2000 , which was used to prosecute newspaper phone hackers			2
however the law has never been used against a stalker or a suspicious spouse hacking the phone of a personal target .			0
