the 11 - year - old who managed to sneak onto a plane without a ticket or passport and fly to @entity4 said it was ' easier than doing my homework			1
' @entity8 slipped away from his mother in @entity10 , caught a bus to the airport three miles away and boarded a plane bound for @entity14 without anyone questioning what he was doing			1
speaking to @entity18 about how he had managed the feat , the schoolboy said it had been easy			1
' i did n't have anything on me and no one asked me for anything , ' he said			2
he added that he had needed to go to the toilet and had simply kept walking until he ended up on the @entity27 plane			0
@entity8 , 11 , was allowed to board a @entity27 flight to @entity14 without being asked for his passport or boarding pass he said : ' i went in the toilet and sat there but i could n't get out			1
then - whoosh ! - we were going up in the sky			2
' it was only when @entity8 began boasting that he had run away from home as the plane cruised over @entity38 that other passengers alerted cabin crew			1
a major investigation has now been launched into how the schoolboy managed to evade security , but the managing director of @entity45 admitted an earlier decision to scrap a headcount of passengers on board before take - off could have been partly to blame			1
mr @entity45 promised to reinstate the policy with immediate effect			0
he said : ' as an airline we take security extremely seriously so i was very surprised to hear the news			2
' we do n’t actually do headcounts on aircraft attached to airbridges - we stopped doing that some time ago , but we have reinstated it with immediate effect after this incident			1
' we are also doing a secondary boarding pass check at the gate			1
we are taking the matter very seriously			0
' upon realising the schoolboy was aboard the plane , it was by then too late to turn around so the flight continued its journey to @entity14			1
@entity8 stayed in the airport with police and airline staff for nearly two hours before being put on a flight home			1
@entity8 , who has learning difficulties , said he did not think much of the @entity4 capital			2
' the police were there			0
it was too big and scary on my own			0
i just wanted to go home and see my mum , ' he said			0
an full investigation is underway at @entity85 after the security lapse as well as causing several hours of panic for @entity8 ’s mother @entity88 , 29 , the astonishing breach of security at @entity85 just before the start of the @entity92 raised urgent questions about @entity95 ’s border protection			2
ms @entity96 said : ' i ca n't get my head around it			0
how did he get that far without anyone asking him one question ? i just keep thinking how easy it would be for a terrorist			2
' yesterday @entity8 ’s father , @entity105 , 34 , spoke of his disbelief that no one at the airport had questioned what an unaccompanied child was doing there			2
he revealed that @entity8 – described as ‘ a handful ’ who has run away in the past – had never been on a plane before and does not own a passport			2
mr @entity105 said : ‘ @entity8 told me the first time he knew he was in a bit of trouble is when the plane started to rise off the ground			0
he just did what the stewardesses told him and sat in his seat with his belt on			0
’ once other passengers raised the alarm , flight crew radioed details of the stowaway to colleagues on the ground			1
on arrival at @entity133 in @entity14 , @entity8 was kept on board while the aircraft was prepared for the return journey			1
finally , eight hours after taking off from @entity85 , he was reunited with his relieved mother			0
with airport security meant to be on heightened alert amid fears of a terrorist attack on the @entity92 , transport secretary @entity138 last night said : ‘ i treat security breaches very , very seriously , so we are now reviewing urgently with @entity85 , and the airline , exactly what happened			1
’ meanwhile , airline @entity27 said it had suspended three employees who had waved @entity8 through and was now carrying out headcounts on all flights			0
@entity8 ’s father explained that his son had been swimming with his mother in @entity10 , @entity85 , when his adventure began on tuesday			2
mr @entity105 , who is separated from @entity8 ’s mother and lives in @entity155 , said his son had to be rescued by a lifeguard			2
‘ that sort of incident would have worried him , ’ the charity shop worker added			0
‘ he has some learning problems and copes differently from other children			1
he must have got changed and given his mother the slip			0
’ after his bus journey , @entity8 wandered into @entity165 at around 1pm and apparently ‘ tailgated ’ another family preparing to go through to security			1
an airport source said : ‘ often one parent has the boarding card for all their children , so the security guard should count the cards and the children , but obviously they ’ve failed to notice there was one extra			1
’ journey 's end : @entity8 managed to get to @entity133 in @entity14 he stressed that @entity8 went through scanners which would have picked up anything suspicious he was carrying			1
once through to the departures , he went to the first gate he could find			0
he is thought to have again mingled with families , and @entity27 staff failed to notice he had no documents as he took a seat			0
a passenger on the return flight , @entity188 , 26 , from @entity189 , said : ‘ he was very talkative and seemed quite unfazed by it all			0
’ @entity8 ’s mother was not at her top - floor housing association flat in @entity193 yesterday , but a neighbour said : ‘ i think he ’s going to be a bit of a hero among his friends for managing it			0
’ a relative added : ‘ @entity8 ’s an attention seeker , he runs away constantly			0
but he ’s never done anything like this			0
the little monster went off to @entity14			1
’ a spokesman for @entity85 said the breach was being ‘ urgently investigated ’ , but added : ‘ the boy went through full security screening so the safety of passengers was never compromised			1
’ in total , @entity8 escaped five checks : security staff should have checked his boarding pass before screening , @entity27 staff should have taken his boarding pass and checked his passport at the gate , flight crew in the cabin should have checked his boarding pass stub , and a passenger headcount should have been carried out before take - off			1
earlier this month police criticised security at @entity85 after an armed robbery suspect being flown back to the @entity95 for questioning escaped through a luggage chute .			0
