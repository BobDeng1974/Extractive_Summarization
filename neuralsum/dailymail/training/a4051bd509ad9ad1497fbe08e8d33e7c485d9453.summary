by @entity0 published : 12:06 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 18:45 est , 16 january 2014 chancellor @entity2 hinted the minimum wage could rise to £ 7 - an - hour the minimum wage could rise to as much as £ 7 an hour next year – adding a potential £ 1,225 a year to the pay packets of millions of workers , @entity2 signalled last night			1
the chancellor backed a dramatic 11 per cent increase in the current rate of £ 6.31 an hour , delighting @entity9 but alarming business leaders , who insisted it should not be increased by more than inflation			1
his surprise intervention provoked an immediate backlash from business groups			0
the @entity16 said the rate should not go up by more than inflation – currently just 2 per cent – while the @entity18 said it should be offset by a reduction in employers ’ national insurance contributions			1
the @entity22 said an unaffordable rise ‘ would end up costing jobs ’			1
but mr @entity2 insisted low - paid workers should ‘ enjoy the fruits ’ of the economic recovery , suggesting that a rise would be carefully calibrated on the advice of the independent @entity30 to avoid it affecting jobs or hurting employers			1
his move is designed to counter @entity36 ’s charge that the government is overseeing a recovery for the few , demonstrating that the proceeds of growth will be shared by all			1
it also appeared deliberately timed to eclipse a speech on living standards by @entity46 today			0
the @entity30 , which makes recommendations on the rate of the minimum wage , has been asked to look at restoring its value – undermined in real terms since the financial crash of 2008 and 2009			1
work and pensions secretary @entity55 , cabinet office minister @entity56 and treasury minister @entity57 are among those who have backed a significant increase , the first part of which is expected to take effect in october			0
it has been suggested that an increase could also save the @entity64 significant sums in lower benefit claims and increased tax receipts			1
critics claim that the change will be difficult for many cash - strapped businesses to manage , and could lead to lay - offs or send some firms to the wall			1
however businesses may be offered more tax relief to compensate for an increased minimum wage			1
government sources said that further cuts to corporation tax or an increase to a new national insurance relief might be used to help firms contend with a new minimum pay rate			1
mr @entity2 said : ‘ i think @entity83 can afford a higher minimum wage			0
i think we have worked hard to get to this point and we can start to enjoy the fruits of all that hard work			0
‘ i believe @entity83 can afford an above - inflation increase in the minimum wage so we can restore its real value for people			1
’ since 2005 the minimum wage has risen by just a few pence , despite soaring inflation leaving workers worse off in real terms the minimum wage rate stands at £ 6.31 for over- 21s , but has fallen in value in real terms since the financial crash he insisted that the exact figure would be set by the @entity30 , adding : ‘ if the minimum wage had kept in line with inflation it would be £ 7			1
‘ just as we were all in this together in the crisis , i want to make sure we ’re all in this together in the recovery			0
@entity111 has made the second highest amount from its investment banking division in its 145 - year history			1
last year ’s figures were beaten only by those in 2007 – the year before the financial crisis struck			2
the bank ’s $ 6billion ( £ 3.6billion ) revenue bonanza helped fuel an average staff payout of £ 234,000			2
the average full - time salary in the @entity83 is £ 27,000			1
meanwhile , @entity111 has unveiled a proposal to get round the cap on bonuses being limited to double bankers ’ salaries – boosting their base salaries with a new payment called ‘ role based pay ’			0
by inflating bankers ’ salaries , they can continue to pay massive bonuses while still claiming that they are no more than double basic pay			0
@entity137 , general secretary of the @entity138 , said : ‘ while millions suffer , @entity111 is brazenly showing who the main beneficiaries of the recovery are with another bumper year for their investment bankers			2
‘ the very people who caused the crash are now hogging the fruits of recovery for themselves , and governments are letting them get away with it			0
’ ‘ because we ’re fixing the economy , because we ’re working through our plan , i believe @entity83 can afford above - inflation increases in the minimum wage and make sure we have a recovery for all and that work pays			2
’ he added : ‘ we are only in a position where we can contemplate an above - inflation increase in the minimum wage because we have taken difficult decisions to fix the @entity83 economy			2
the work is not yet half done			0
’ last week he claimed any increase would be carefully thought through , saying : ‘ i think everyone wants to see an increase in the minimum wage			0
i would like to see an increase in the minimum wage			0
but it has to be done in a way that does n’t cost jobs			0
we have a @entity30 as a body that exists to make exactly that judgment			1
‘ we have got to get the balance right between supporting business , growing our economy and making sure it is a recovery for all , and that is what our long - term plan is all about			2
’ yesterday mr @entity55 welcomed the ‘ bold move ’ , saying : ‘ at the heart of all our reforms this government is concerned to improve the quality of life for the poorest in society			2
’ business minister @entity191 , the first member of the government to call for a significant minimum wage hike , said : ‘ modern conservatives are passionate backers of the minimum wage , as part of a plan to make work pay and ensure everyone can benefit from the recovery			0
’ and @entity202 , founder of renewal – a campaign group dedicated to ‘ blue collar @entity204 ’ – said : ‘ for a party that once opposed the minimum wage this is momentous			0
it shows the @entity194 can become the real workers ’ party , standing up for the low paid			2
’ however @entity210 , from the @entity211 , said : ‘ although there is an increased disparity between the highest and lowest earners , arbitrarily raising the floor is n’t necessarily the solution and could make the @entity83 economy uncompetitive in the long term			0
