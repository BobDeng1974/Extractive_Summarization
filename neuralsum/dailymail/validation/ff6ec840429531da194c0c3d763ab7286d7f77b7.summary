@entity0 has knocked back an invitation from @entity2 to visit the @entity4 garage this weekend , fearing a pr stunt			1
@entity6 star @entity0 and @entity4 ace @entity2 became involved in a spat during the @entity9 press conference			1
it resulted in @entity0 suggesting @entity4 should open up their garage at the @entity12 for an inspection of their cars in the wake of a dominant display at @entity18 's @entity17			1
@entity0 , speaking ahead of the @entity19 @entity9 , has snubbed an invite from @entity2 @entity0 branded @entity2 's invitation to visit the @entity4 garage in @entity19 as ' staged ' and a ' pr stunt ' @entity2 then invited @entity0 , with the latter suggesting the debrief in the engineers ' room for his visit			1
now , however , such a plan has been knocked down as @entity0 said : ' when i was joking with @entity2 in the press conference the deal was the invite was for all the paddock			2
now it seems the invite has shrunk to just me			0
' initially i think it was called off by @entity36 ( @entity37 , @entity4 non-executive director ) and @entity39 ( @entity40 , @entity4 motorsport boss )			0
@entity2 finished second behind race - winner @entity41 at the season - opening @entity42 @entity9 ' now they 've told ( @entity2 ) yes , so i think they are using it as a bit more of a pr thing rather than a proper invite , so the answer is no i wo n't be going			2
' asked as to whether it was his decision or that of @entity6 , he said : ' it was n't really discussed to be honest			0
' initially it was called off and then i think they tried to use it as " ah yeah , we are so friendly and open to everyone "			0
' even if i went there , do you think they would really open up ? that means i wo n't go , because even if i go it 's all staged			0
