the initial round of shipments will be 3 to 5 million watches			0
@entity2 anticipates a total of 24 million watches to be shipped during 2015 , @entity102 said			0

a ' source close to @entity2 ' told the information last month that the firm ' would be lucky to ship [ the watch ] before @entity172 '			1
@entity110 falls on 19 february next year , so ms @entity174 comments push it at least beyond this date			1
despite the range of impressive features unveiled by mr @entity112 , there was something he failed to mention : battery life			0
the telling omission suggests the watch ’s battery life will be the @entity185 of the device when it eventually does go on sale			1
@entity2 is said to be unhappy with the watch 's battery life , and the long lead time before the $ 349 ( £ 216 ) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it 's released early next year			1
@entity2 's chief executive @entity112 ( pictured ) unveiled the watch at a launch event in september			1
although he did n't reveal battery life details , mr @entity112 did spend some time talking about the watch 's charging system , which combines @entity2 ’s magsafe technology with inductive charging most existing smartwatches on the market , such as @entity202 and @entity203 , tend to last up to a week on a single charge			2
the closest @entity112 came to talking about the battery life for the watch was saying that users would ‘ charge it at night			2
’ during an interview in @entity211 , @entity2 's senior vice president of operations @entity209 said : ' we want to make the best product in the world			0
' one of our competitors is on their fourth or fifth attempt , but nobody is wearing them			0
' the company 's chief executive added that the @entity5 ‘ can be worn all day , for any occasion , ’ but hourly figures were notably absent			0

the long lead time before the $ 349 ( £ 216 ) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it 's released early next year a spokesperson for @entity2 declined to provide battery details to @entity242 and said they will be revealed closer to launch next year			0
like many of @entity2 ’s other products , the @entity5 appears to have a sealed back , which means the battery can not be replaced			0
this suggests that the entire $ 349 ( £ 216 ) device will have to be replaced , once the battery eventually deteriorates from constant charging and use			0
another concern is the launch of the health and activity - tracking apps on the @entity5 , which will rely on adequate battery life for round - the - clock monitoring			0
companies including @entity259 and @entity260 have health trackers that are designed to be worn at night too , monitoring sleep patterns through movements			0
however , if the watch has to be charged at night , vital health signs could be missed companies including @entity259 and @entity260 have health trackers that are designed to be worn at night too , monitoring sleep patterns through movements			2
however , if the watch has to be charged at night , vital health signs could be missed by the gadget which @entity2 says will ‘ motivate people to be more active and more healthy			2
’ @entity2 did , however , spend some time talking about the watch 's charging system , which combines @entity2 ’s magsafe technology with inductive charging			2
@entity2 ’s silence on battery life suggests the company is still working to improve the feature			0
the success of the device could hang on whether or not it manages to do it in time .			0

@entity63 staff expected to undergo training in february
