i lost more than just my hair when i lost my hair			0
' @entity12 's first bout with the disease came at age 23 , when she was diagnosed with uterine cancer			1
the long and short of it : the 59 - year - old had n't had a haircut in nearly a decade although she did n't lose her hair during that treatment , it led to a life - changing meeting with a young girl in a children 's cancer ward , who said her greatest wish was to have long hair like @entity12 's			1
' they could 've shaved my head in that moment and i would 've handed her my hair , ' she recalled of the heartbreaking moment			0
from then on , @entity12 donated her her hair to children with cancer every few years up until her second diagnosis nine years ago			2

when it was time for the big reveal , @entity12 stepped out in a sleek , modern bob , gasping as she saw her stunning reflection in an oversize mirror			0
' this is reminiscent of my thirties , and i 'd like to go back there , ' she said .			0
