@entity0 are likely to have to pay £ 250,000 if they want to land @entity2 this month			1
@entity4 boss @entity3 confirmed the champions ’ interest in the winger this week , with contact already thought to have been made over a pre-contract offer that could see him switch to @entity11 in the summer			1
a quicker move to have @entity2 on board for the title run - in would require an outlay , but could also cut off @entity17 competition at the pass			1
@entity0 will have to pay £ 250,000 if they want to sign @entity19 winger @entity2 this month the 24 - year - old ( left ) is also the subject of interest from @entity24 outfit @entity23 @entity23 want to sign the 24 - year - old immediately and have seen an offer in the region of £ 100,000 rejected by the @entity29 club			1
it ’s thought @entity19 would want more than double that amount before being persuaded to part with him during the current transfer window			1
returning from the club ’s training camp in @entity38 yesterday , @entity35 @entity34 was reluctant to be drawn too much on the situation but admitted @entity2 has attributes that appeal			1
‘ he ’s a good football player			2
he ’s got pace , he ’s skilful , but he ’s a @entity19 player			1
we ’re looking for speed in the wider areas and at the top of the pitch			2
it ’s very important and if we can find that it would obviously be very good for us			2
’ @entity0 boss @entity3 reckons a move for @entity2 would be a good call in the @entity53 title race reports in @entity55 have also linked the club with a move for highly - rated @entity59 defender @entity58			1
@entity60 have bid £ 1million bid for the 20 - year - old @entity62 under - 21 international , but @entity0 , @entity63 and @entity64 are also said to be interested			1
any move would inevitably heighten speculation over the future of @entity68 but @entity3 reiterated his stance on the @entity71 and @entity72 target when he said : ‘ the most important thing is to keep our players			2
' we start with that and then if we get some players who can make us better we will do it			2
when we come back now that ’s the window starting – and then there will be something behind the rumours maybe			2
’ meanwhile , @entity3 has revealed he is happier now to let his players blow off some steam and relax			1
@entity0 defender @entity68 ( right ) is wanted by @entity71 and @entity72 he earned a hardline reputation for banning junk food and fizzy drinks from the players ’ lunch menu			1
however , after allowing his squad to socialise and invite their families on the week - long sunshine break in @entity93 , he says his senior players have earned the right to some rest and recreation			2
‘ i ’m not hard , ’ claimed @entity3			0
‘ if you are not fit then you have a problem			0
but these players in this squad now are fit			0
the things we were talking about six months ago are not there anymore			0
‘ it ’s not just about doing all the wrong things			0
it ’s okay to relax			0
they eat very well , there is no problem with that			0
what this trip is all about is relaxing their head			0
‘ but they also have to be in shape and train and be prepared			0
we had some good training and played the games			0
we asked them questions in the summer – and they gave us good answers			1
’ @entity0 squad recently enjoyed a week - long sunshine break in @entity93 and were allowed to invite their families returning to @entity125 ahead of saturday ’s clash with @entity127 - and trailing @entity128 by four points - @entity3 still has niggles affecting @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133			1
@entity134 made his return from injury in a 3 - 2 defeat to @entity138 – but could be granted compassionate leave following the death of friend @entity141			1
‘ @entity132 has an issue with his ankle so we have rested him , ’ added @entity3			0
‘ he is training but we need everybody now to be 100 per cent going into this period			0
the injured players like @entity149 , @entity131 and @entity150 are close now			0
it looks very positive so we are looking forward to the game on saturday			0
