worried : @entity0 has held crisis talks at @entity2 after being told of allegations of a sensational love affair which has potentially significant political implications for him @entity0 has held crisis talks at @entity2 after being told of allegations of a sensational love affair which has potentially significant political implications for him			1
for legal reasons , @entity9 can not disclose the identities of the people involved or any details of the relationship – even its duration – other than that they are middle - aged figures			1
the affair has now concluded			0
but this newspaper can report that when aides told mr @entity0 the identities of the alleged lovers he was ‘ stunned ’ , and , according to sources , ‘ immediately realised the importance of the story ’			1
the prime minister and his aides also discussed the possible fallout should details of the affair become public – and how such disclosure could ‘ blow out of the water ’ any major political set pieces planned by @entity35			1
one senior source told this newspaper last night : ‘ this revelation is dynamite			1
none of us could believe it when we first heard it			0
then we just thought , “ what a complete mess ”			0
’ the source added that , apart from the political implications , the revelation had caused ‘ great personal distress to innocent parties ’			2
it is understood that the prime minister was told of the relationship - which does not involve anyone serving in the @entity53 - within the past few weeks			2
if details of the affair do emerge , it could place a further strain on mr @entity0 ’s leadership , which is already being tested by backbench revolts over issues such as @entity60 and gay marriage and rumours of plots being hatched to overthrow him			1
on friday , he faced a further blow when one of his mps , @entity66 , resigned the party whip after being caught in a cash - for - questions ‘ sting ’ operation			2
if the affair is revealed , it is likely to cause as much public surprise as the disclosure of the relationship between @entity77 and @entity78 , which was kept secret for nearly two decades until 2002			2
like mr @entity77 , mr @entity0 is increasingly finding his time in @entity2 is beset by sex scandals			1

a third person has also given a statement to @entity98 police , claiming to have been sexually assaulted by mr @entity90 , and on friday police said they were planning to interview a fourth alleged victim who claims he was intimately groped by mr @entity90 in a @entity88 bar			0
in april , @entity102 said it had launched a formal investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct by the @entity108 peer @entity106			0
the @entity109 set up a phoneline for alleged victims after a number of women made claims about inappropriate conduct by the peer , who was the party ’s former chief election strategist			0

@entity66 , right , was caught in a cash - for - questions ‘ sting ’ operation deputy prime minister @entity125 , who had initially denied knowing about the allegations , was later forced to concede that his office had heard ‘ indirect and non-specific concerns ’ as far back as 2008			1
and , in a further case , @entity108 mp @entity129 will tomorrow face a disciplinary hearing to determine whether he should lose the party whip over ‘ very serious allegations ’ of sexual assault			0
mr @entity125 asked the party ’s chief whip to convene the meeting after @entity129 was served papers as part of a @entity141 civil action brought by a ‘ vulnerable ’ constituent			2
