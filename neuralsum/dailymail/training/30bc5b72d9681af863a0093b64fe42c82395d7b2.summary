by @entity0 @entity2 's much anticipated press conference in @entity3 was cut dramatically short today after doctors said he was not feeling well and would have to remain in their care			1
his planned flight out of @entity3 to @entity7 tomorrow has been postponed for at least four or five days until doctors decide he is well enough to travel			0
@entity2 said very few words through interpreter @entity10			2
doctors have postponed his flight home to @entity7 , scheduled for tomorrow , for at least four or five days he said : ' i thank the government of the @entity18 and all my friends who have helped me on the way and especially mr @entity22 ' , who is the head of the immigration department			0
officials said @entity2 's paperwork had also not been finalised			1
the minister of foreign affairs , mr @entity27 said : ' the investigation is ongoing to verify the story of how he ( @entity2 ) got to the @entity18			2
' i wo n't give you all the details , but we will eventually tell everybody			0
so far the story has been substantiated			0
' his hair tamed and beard shaved , the 37 - year - old had to be supported as he arrived at the press conference he made no further comment and did not explain why an investigation was still continuing			1
officials said it was likely that @entity2 would not be able to travel until at least monday - and there was the added problem of finding an official to fly with him			1
an official from the @entity48 in @entity49 who was due to leave with @entity2 tomorrow ( @entity50 ) will now have to return to the @entity51 on saturday , leaving the question open of who will travel with the fisherman			2
it is understood he will fly from @entity3 to @entity56 , then on to @entity57 before flying direct to @entity58			2
as @entity2 does not have a passport , he will need special paperwork to be allowed to enter @entity62 territory en route to @entity58			1
the man who has made headlines around the world washed up on the remote @entity18 , 8,000 miles from where he originally disappeared in a small fishing boat , on monday			1
he has told of starving on his broken - down fishing boat , living on the flesh of tiny fish and turtles , and drinking the blood of sea birds , turtles and even his own urine			1
he said he had been drifting for 14 months , after his engine cut out in september , while he was on a fishing trip with a friend			1
wearing nothing but a pair of torn shorts , the sailor and his battered 23ft boat washed ashore , 8,000 miles from his home in @entity58 , on the remote coral @entity87			1
new pictures of the 37 - year - old emerged , showing @entity2 four days after he washed ashore on the remote @entity87			1
despite stumbling through the surf to reach the beach semi-naked and wearing nothing but a tattered pair of shorts , four days later the father - of - one appears the picture of health			1
washed and clean , he showed no signs of a man who had endured a grueling 14 months at sea			1
yet on monday when he was revealed to the world , @entity2 looked , arguably , in a worse condition			2
today it emerged the @entity12 fled his home on the @entity105 of @entity58 12 years ago after he was stabbed in a brutal bar fight			1
this was one of the first pictures of @entity2 , taken after he was revealed to the world on monday			2
he washed ashore in the @entity18 days earlier , after surviving 14 months drifting at sea this picture shows @entity2 looking healthy and clean just four days after he was washed up on the remote coral @entity87			1
he looks arguably better than when he arrived on the mainland on monday to face the world 's cameras while out drinking in the village of @entity118 , @entity2 got into an arguement with four men and was stabbed , punched and kicked to the point his family feared he would not survive			1
after 15 days in hospital he made an incredible recovery			0
but , terrified his attackers , who lived locally , would target him again he fled the country , deeming it too dangerous for him to stay			0
he left his wife @entity127 and the couple 's 18 - month - old daughter @entity128 at home			2
@entity128 , who is now 13 years old , has no memories of her father and said meeting him would be ' awkward ' having spoken to him for the first time on the phone a few days ago			0
after crossing the @entity136 border by bus , @entity2 settled in the @entity138 of @entity139 where he worked as a fisherman			2
it was in september 2012 , that @entity2 set off for that fateful day 's fishing with his friend 's son , @entity143 in their 23ft boat			1
speaking through an interpreter @entity2 said : ' it broke down and we started drifting			2
' we were lucky that we had already caught two sharks that day and we were able to eat them for a time but then they went bad and we had to throw the carcasses overboard			0
' it emerged @entity2 fled his @entity58 home after he was stabbed and brutally beaten to within an inch of his life during a bar fight			1
he left his wife @entity158 and their young daughter @entity128 @entity128 has never met her father , she was a year and a half when @entity2 left @entity58 for @entity7 , where he found work as a fisherman he said his companion , @entity143 had died after the pair drifted for four months			1
' my friend tried to drink the blood of turtles but he kept being sick because it disagreed with his stomach , ' he said			2
when it came to the time when his young friend died and he had to lower the body overboard , he shook his head , indicating it was a moment he did want to recall			2
the boat 's deck , he said , was triangular and on it was what he said was a large box , although he was vague when it came to describing it exactly			0
he said : ' i would get under the box to stay out of the sun , but it was also there that i prayed			0
i prayed and prayed to be saved			0
i am not a @entity188 but i do believe in @entity189			0
he sent food to me all the time			0
' i caught small fish by putting my hands in the water and wriggling my fingers			1
this attracted the fish and i was then able to grab them			0
' in what he said was a sign from @entity189 , after the many months at sea he woke one morning and saw a bird sitting on the edge of the boat			0
the 23ft fishing boat @entity2 claims to have lived on , surviving 14 months drifting through the @entity105 the family of @entity2 's companion @entity208 , who died after four months at sea			1
@entity2 said @entity208 starved to death as he was unable to stomach their diet of turtle 's blood and raw fish the family of @entity217 have demanded answers as to how the 24 - year - old died			1
his brother @entity220 , pictured , has called for @entity2 to be brought back to @entity7 to be quizzed ' i crept very quietly to it and i was able to catch it			0
i broke off its head to drink its blood as i had been doing but as i was doing that , as i was tilting my head back , i saw land			0
it was the first land i had seen			0
' he was able to half swim , half stagger , through the shallow water and collapse on the beach			0
' it had taken me a long time to reach the beach and it was then early evening			0
' but the family of @entity217 have demanded more answers as to how the 24 - year - old perished			1
his brother @entity220 , 29 , has called for @entity2 - nicknamed @entity239 - to be brought back to @entity7 to answer questions			2
he told @entity241 : ' we ask the authorities to bring the shipwrecked man , @entity244 , back here or take some of us to meet him , so we can find out was it really our brother who he is talking about			0
' if it is , why did he die ? why would n't he eat raw fish and birds ? what did he do with his body ? there is a lot of confusion and we want to hear it from @entity257			0
' it 's a miracle that @entity239 survived at sea for 14 months , and we feel no anger towards him			1
we understand this was an accident and how dangerous the sea can be			0
' but we need confirmation from him before we can accept his death			0
