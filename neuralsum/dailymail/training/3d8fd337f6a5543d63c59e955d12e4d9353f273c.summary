detailing the anatomy of the female reproductive system and the breasts , the pant and bra set is similar to the more simple ‘ nipple bikini ’ which hit headlines recently			1
part of the ‘ @entity18 ’ movement which aims to end the stigma surrounding female bodies , the bikini caused a stir as celebrities like @entity21 shared pictures of it online			1

one set of pictures , entitled ' @entity52 ' , shows a woman with thorns instead of underarm hair , aiming to highlight upon the constant narrow - minded views that it is somehow an abnormal occurrence for a woman to have body hair			2
speaking to @entity60 says : ‘ the main influence for me for this piece is the divide that 's been made between genders			0
