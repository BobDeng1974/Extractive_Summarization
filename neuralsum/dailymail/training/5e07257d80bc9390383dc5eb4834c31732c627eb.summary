by @entity0 published : 18:09 est , 12 july 2012 updated : 18:09 est , 12 july 2012 the @entity2 campaign has accused @entity3 of being a serial liar and the president ’s aides hit back by suggesting the @entity8 candidate might have committed a felony as the 2012 election reached new heights of rancour			1
after weeks of @entity8 urging mr @entity2 to hit back hard at attacks on his record at @entity16 , his campaign released a new television ad entitled ‘ no evidence ’ accusing mr @entity3 of deceit in claiming that the former @entity21 governor shipped jobs overseas while heading the venture capital firm			1
the ad , which will run in several battleground states , asks voters : ‘ when a president does n't tell the truth , how can we trust him to lead ? ’ the press release which accompanied the ad in an email to journalists also referred to mr @entity3 's ‘ lies and exaggerations ’			2
under fire : @entity2 has been accused by the @entity3 campaign of committing a felony by lying in regulatory documents about his employment at @entity16 but mr @entity2 found himself on the defensive over a @entity43 article citing federal documents filed by @entity16 that conflicted with the presumptive @entity8 nominee ’s statements about when he left @entity16			1
in a filing with the @entity48 in february 2001 , @entity16 listed mr @entity2 as the company 's ‘ sole shareholder , sole director , chief executive officer and president ’			1
it said mr @entity2 's ‘ principal occupation ’ was as @entity16 's managing director			2
mr @entity2 's campaign , backed up by a number of independent fact checkers , has repeatedly said mr @entity2 had almost nothing to do with the company 's operations after february 1999 , when he began work on the imperilled 2002 @entity63			1
@entity64 , mr @entity2 ’s spokeswoman , said that her boss ‘ left @entity16 in february of 1999 to run the @entity65 , and had no input on investments or management of companies after that point ’			2
accusation : the @entity2 campaign has suggested that president @entity3 is lying about @entity16 in campaign ads the significance of the period from 1999 to 2001 is that it covers the time when @entity77 oversaw investments that either sent jobs abroad or filed for bankruptcy			1
it 's also when mr @entity2 stated in federal disclosure forms that he was not active in @entity16			2
for example , in late 1999 , @entity16 - controlled @entity83 set up overseas call centres , and a subsidiary moved jobs from @entity88 to @entity89			0
the following year , the @entity91 company declared bankruptcy			0
in 2001 , the steel maker @entity93 also fell to bankruptcy as @entity16 made $ 58.4million from its investment			0
@entity8 fear that the relentless attacks on mr @entity2 , who is worth more than $ 250million , over his time at @entity16 , his failure to release tax returns , his investments in @entity99 bank accounts , @entity100 and the @entity101 are defining him as an out - of - touch plutocrat			2
the two presidential campaigns dispute how many @entity109 jobs were affected but the @entity2 campaign 's line all along has been that it is irrelevant because mr @entity2 was n't involved in the company ’s decisions for that period			0
@entity116 , mr @entity3 's deputy campaign manager , said that mr @entity2 may have committed a felony if he misrepresented his role at @entity16 on the @entity48 documents			1
and if he was running @entity16 after 1999 , ms @entity116 said , mr @entity2 has n't been truthful with the public			0
‘ if that 's the case , if he was lying to the @entity109 people , then that 's a real character and trust issue , ’ she said			0
@entity125 , mr @entity2 ’s campaign manager , issued a blistering statement in response			0
‘ president @entity3 's campaign hit a new low today when one of its senior advisers made a reckless and unsubstantiated charge to reporters about @entity2 that was so over the top that it calls into question the integrity of their entire campaign , ’ he said			1
‘ president @entity3 ought to apologize for the out - of - control behaviour of his staff , which demeans the office he holds			0
campaigns are supposed to be hard fought , but statements like those made by @entity116 belittle the process and the candidate on whose behalf she works			0

president has hit out at @entity2 's record as boss of @entity16
@entity8 candidate accuses @entity3 of ' lies and exaggerations ' in campaign ads
but @entity158 's campaign suggests @entity2 could have committed felony by *misleading* @entity48 about his role at @entity16
