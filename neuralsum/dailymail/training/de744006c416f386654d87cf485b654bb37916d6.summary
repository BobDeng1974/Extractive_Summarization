by @entity0 published : 23:07 est , 15 september 2013 updated : 23:08 est , 15 september 2013 environmental campaigners have criticised @entity2 moves to delay until 2015 its plan to charge shoppers for plastic bags in supermarkets			1
the introduction of a 5p charge per bag was announced by deputy prime minister @entity9 on saturday , and was welcomed by green campaigners and shoppers			2
however , it will not begin in @entity13 until 2015 , despite already operating in @entity14 and @entity15 , with @entity16 following next year			1
banished : from 2015 , all supermarkets and department stores in @entity13 will charge 5p for a plastic carrier bag last night , campaigners fighting the blight caused by bag litter called on ministers to bring forward the launch , saying the delay was unnecessary and disappointing			1
@entity27 of @entity26 said : ‘ there is no need for new legislation in @entity13 as retailers are already geared up to deal with it			2
we would like to sit down with the government and the retail sector to discuss introducing a charge earlier			2
’ he said adopting the controls in 2014 rather than 2015 could result in 5.25 billion fewer carrier bags being handed out at tills			1
@entity39 : the new charge was announced by @entity41 leader @entity9 , pictured meeting volunteers from the @entity43 at @entity45 nature reserve the @entity47 majority in the @entity48 is understood to have insisted on a delay until after the next general election in may 2015 , despite the benefits to the environment and that money raised by the charges will be given to charities that tackle the impact of plastic bags on wildlife and the environment			1
the delay is just one of a number of measures that supporters fear will restrict its impact			0
significantly , the charge will apply only to stores that employ more than 250 people			0
this will allow thousands of other retailers to continue giving away millions of single - use bags			0
as a result , the scheme in @entity13 will operate differently to the ones in @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 , where all bags carry a charge			1
separately , retailers may be able to keep some or all of the cash from the charges , rather than being under a legal obligation to give it to good causes			0
destructive legacy : most free plastic carrier bags are not used for more than 20 minute , but can take up to 1,000 years to naturally dissolve keep @entity26 and the @entity85 ( @entity85 ) are among the many supporters of the @entity88 ’s five - year ‘ @entity89 ’ campaign			1
@entity85 spokesman @entity90 said : ‘ @entity13 is really lagging behind the rest , and we would like to see the change come in earlier than 2015			2
’ the @entity94 , which speaks for the big supermarkets , favours a single national scheme			0
a spokesman said : ‘ any legislation should be , as far as possible , consistent across the @entity99 to avoid confusion for customers and businesses			0
’ a @entity41 source dismissed the criticism , saying : ‘ we are introducing this measure on a timetable that is realistic			0
we want to make sure we get it right			0

a 5p *mandatory* charge per plastic bag will be introduced across @entity13
but the charge wo *n't* be implemented until 2015 - after the general election
introducing the charge a year earlier could result in 5.25 billion fewer carrier bags being handed out at tills
