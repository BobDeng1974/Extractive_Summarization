an @entity8 - sponsored spot starring @entity10 manly man @entity9 has angered celiac disease sufferers for its suggestion they should toughen up and watch some @entity14			1
' when our idea of danger is eating gluten , there ’s trouble afoot , ' says @entity9 in the ad , which by monday morning had already spurred some 18,000 people to sign a petition to remove the reference			1
it implies that we 're soft			0
' @entity9 's monologue indeed references gluten once in a series of examples of how @entity42 has ' gotten soft			2
' the ad 's solution is n't avoiding gluten , as 3 million celiac sufferers must do every day throughout their lives , it is to ' get some @entity14 in your life			1
' gluten @entity51 takes issue with the suggestion , ' we 're weak ... we 're part of @entity42 's problem			0

' when our idea of danger is eating gluten , there ’s trouble afoot , ' says @entity9 in the ad , which by monday morning had already spurred some 18,000 people to sign a petition to remove the reference ' i think about all of the people who have gotten sick at restaurants because the kitchen and / or the staff do not take us seriously , ' he writes			1
@entity51 wrote after seeing the ad prior to the @entity1 that his plea , which also appears at @entity75 , had been heard by @entity8			1
' @entity8 has announced they will remove the gluten reference , ' he wrote saturday			1
however , the ad -- complete with the gluten joke -- indeed went on to come through on the televisions of 100 million people sunday			1
so @entity8 lied , ' @entity51 wrote			2
' they are not running the gluten reference ad only online			1
why am i not surprised ? ! ' known only as @entity31 , the man behind the petition has a history of demanding attention be paid to the issue of celiac disease @entity51 is found primarily in wheat , but also in rye , barley , and to a lesser extent , oats			1
it makes up the protein part of these grains , and is the substance that makes bread dough elastic			0
