@entity0 and the @entity1 love an eye - catching signing at @entity3 but for manager @entity5 the enforced absence of £ 59.7million winger @entity6 against @entity7 on sunday might be the best news he ’s had this season			1
of all the troubles that have afflicted @entity12 in the last few months , none will have frustrated him more than the most expensive player in @entity15 history			0
@entity16 flickered brightly when he first arrived from @entity17 but the last six months have signalled a steady decline due to injury , loss of form , an unfortunate burglary and most recently a stupid red card for pulling referee @entity24 against @entity25 on monday night			1
@entity6 pleads his innocence after being booked by referee @entity24 in the defeat to @entity25 @entity24 shows the red card to @entity16 after he tugged at the referee 's shirt following a yellow card @entity16 walks off the pitch after receiving the red card during the @entity35 quarter - final with @entity25 @entity3 now have to face @entity7 without him as they begin a run of key fixtures that will define their chances of getting into the @entity40			1
@entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 all await in just over a month			0
yet @entity16 ’s absence also gives @entity12 an opportunity			1
by his own admission , the @entity3 manager likes to kill off opponents by applying pressure through extended spells of possession			1
it requires patience from fans and players			0
for an instinctive risk - taker like @entity16 , it ’s akin to being a square peg in a round hole			2
and for @entity3 , the deliberate build - up does n’t work if after 20 passes , their star man dribbles into a defender and does n’t fight to win the ball back			2
@entity65 has tried the @entity66 in several positions but none have worked			0
without @entity16 against @entity7 , themselves pushing for a top - four place , @entity12 has greater options			1
he can opt for two traditional wingers , @entity72 and @entity73 , recall the flair of @entity75 or goal - poacher ’s instinct of @entity78 , or play a midfield three of @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 to give him the control he craves			0
for now , @entity12 is treading carefully with @entity16			2
it would n’t be wise to tell the board they ’ve wasted their money and with the player ’s confidence at a low ebb after his red card hastened @entity3 ’s @entity35 exit , the manager wants to build him up , not destroy him			2
@entity3 ace @entity81 battles for the ball with fellow @entity95 @entity94 at @entity96 manager @entity5 speaks to @entity72 during the @entity35 quarter - final defeat at @entity96 @entity3 midfielder @entity80 vies for the ball with former team - mate @entity99 even so , it ’s significant when the @entity3 manager said on saturday : ‘ you pick up players like @entity75 and @entity6 as they are very creative and dangerous , but when you lose the ball too much every trainer - coach will say , “ you do n’t have to lose so many balls ” , as we have to fight back to win the ball again , or the opponent can score			1
‘ that is always the balance between creative and measuring the risk and ball possession of the opponent			0
and that is not only for @entity75 and @entity16 but for every player			2
’ @entity3 have invested too much in @entity16 to jettison him at the first sign of trouble , particularly if no other club is willing to financially compensate a great deal of their outlay			1
but should @entity3 convincingly overcome a @entity7 side brimming with youthful energy in the form of @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 , questions will be asked if they are a better unit without their most expensive acquisition			1
@entity7 's @entity131 midfielder @entity127 battles @entity132 for the ball at @entity134 @entity7 midfielder @entity128 looks to beat @entity136 ace @entity135 to the ball of course , the break - in at @entity16 ’s house was horrible for his family , who have effectively been forced from their home and now live in a hotel			1
but it leaves @entity12 in a tricky position			0
in the build - up to sunday 's showdown , the @entity3 manager tried to address all sides			1
he said he expected @entity16 to be at the club next season , but at the same time would be sympathetic to any player who was experiencing off - field problems and wanted to leave			2
he also pointed out that financial considerations meant the club could n’t allow @entity16 to go cheap			2
in shorthand it ’s unlikely @entity3 would beat off any suitors who waved £ 50m at them to sign @entity16 this summer			1
@entity12 and @entity159 stand with an official as they look to get their tactics across at @entity96 the manager ’s immediate priority is to try and beat @entity7			2
any other result would hand the advantage of @entity40 qualification to @entity25 , @entity41 and also @entity168 ’s team			0
failure to be among @entity171 ’s elite for a second consecutive season would be cataclysmic for @entity3 on many levels			0
for @entity12 , a manager who has won championships with @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 , the price would be hurtful in football terms even without the monetary implications			0
‘ i do n’t think that i ’m here to think about the financial consequences — that is ( for ) @entity0 , ’ he argued			0
‘ i ’m here to manage the professional football department of @entity3 and i ’m here because of my qualities and my philosophy			0
@entity16 celebrates a rare goal in a @entity3 shirt after scoring against @entity189 at @entity96 ‘ i think they are pleased with my way of managing the club			1
i am not thinking of the consequences if i am not in fourth or third			0
it is very bad for the club but why do we have to speak about things that have not happened yet ? ’ @entity3 have lost only two league games since november 2 but their form has been unconvincing and their fans have booed players for an often safety - first approach			0
the @entity3 manager insists everything is on track and the players are buying into his famed philosophy , even if some supporters are impatient with his pragmatic approach			0
due to his price tag , it would have been hard to imagine @entity16 being dropped for such an important fixture as this one against @entity7			1
now he ca n’t play , it will be interesting to see if @entity3 gel better as a team without him			0
@entity16 takes on @entity215 team - mate @entity214 as @entity3 face rivals @entity42			1

@entity6 will miss @entity3 's clash with @entity7
@entity16 is *suspended* after being sent off in the *midweek* defeat to @entity25
but could his *unavailability* be a blessing in *disguise* for the @entity224 ?
former @entity17 ace has been poor for @entity228 's side recently
