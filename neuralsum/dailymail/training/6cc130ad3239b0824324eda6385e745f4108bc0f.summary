by @entity1 reporter published : 15:25 est , 12 august 2012 @entity3 : 02:01 est , 13 august 2012 @entity5 engineers have successfully demonstrated new technology that enables drones to function like a ' swarm of insects ' where they can communicate and carry out tasks in mid-air			1
in june , engineers and researchers from @entity15 tested their technology on two @entity18 drones in @entity19 , @entity5 revealed			2
the drone development could lead to lower costs and less risk in military welfare , @entity5 said in a statement			1
swarm : @entity5 engineers and researchers from @entity15 successfully tested their swarm technology on two @entity18 drones in @entity19			2
seen here is a @entity18 using just a military radio and a laptop , an operator on the ground was able to connect with the autonomous drones instructing them to carry out a mission simultaneously			0
' this swarm technology may one day enable warfighters in battle to request and receive time - critical intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance information directly from airborne ( unmanned aerial vehicles ) much sooner than they can from ground control stations today , ' @entity35 , @entity5 â€™s program director of advanced autonomous networks , said			1
' swarm network technology has the potential to offer more missions at less risk and lower operating costs , ' the statement continues			2
@entity5 revealed the ' swarm ' technology at the @entity53 , where robot makers gather to show off their wares			0
the @entity57 @entity56 have also tested drone ' swarm ' technology recently , showing off a network of 20 nano quadrotors flying in synchronized formations			0
the @entity64 goal is to combine swarm technology with bio-inspired drones to operate ' with little or no direct human supervision ' in ' dynamic , resource - constrained , adversarial environments , ' the university said			0
drone developments : the ' swarm ' development has the potential to offer more military missions at less risk and lower operating costs ; seen here is a @entity76 drone with @entity78 members indeed , it is most likely the future of hard - to - detect drone surveillance will mimic nature			1
research suggests that the mechanics of insects can be reverse - engineered to design midget machines to scout battlefields and search for victims trapped in rubble			1
scientists have taken their inspiration from animals which have evolved over millennia to the perfect conditions for flight			0
nano - biomimicry mav design has long been studied by the @entity97 , and in 2008 the @entity100 government 's military research agency - @entity98 - conducted a symposium discussing ' bugs , bots , borgs and bio-weapons			1
' the same year , the @entity106 unveiled insect - sized spies ' as tiny as bumblebees ' that could not be detected and would be able to fly into buildings to ' photograph , record , and even attack insurgents and terrorists			0
' around the same time the @entity106 also unveiled what it called ' lethal mini-drones ' based on @entity117 's blueprints for his @entity119 flying machine , and claimed they would be ready for roll out by 2015 .			0
