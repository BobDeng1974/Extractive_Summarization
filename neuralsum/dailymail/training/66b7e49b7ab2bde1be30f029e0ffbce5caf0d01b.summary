@entity0 has found himself at the centre of a cultural row after he was accused of disrespecting the @entity4 president by his ' rude ' handshake yesterday			1
the @entity7 founder has been heavily criticised by the country 's media because he shook president @entity10 , while keeping his left in his trouser pocket			1
@entity4 newspapers attacked the billionaire for his casual style and pictures of the meeting were splashed across the front page of the country 's national newspapers today			1
the @entity39 newspaper wrote : ' cultural difference , or an act of disrespect ? ' while others called it a ' disrespectful and casual handshake '			2
a one - hand shake is often seen as disrespectful in @entity4 and parts of @entity47 , and is normally reserved for someone younger or a good friend			2
mr @entity0 was in the country to give a lecture on the charitable @entity52 at the @entity53 in @entity54			1
he met university students and executives of @entity57 before his scheduled meeting with president @entity25			1
some @entity4 newspapers cropped out the offending hand while others highlighted it the @entity7 founder was visiting @entity4 to give a lecture for the charitable @entity52 ' perhaps it was his all - american style but an open jacket with hand in pocket ? that was way too casual			1
it was very regretful , ' @entity71 , secretary general at the @entity53 , was quoted by @entity73 as saying			2
@entity4 media reported that @entity0 has caused similar controversy in the past when meeting the country 's leaders			1
in 2002 , @entity0 gave a two - handed shake to the @entity80 but in 2008 gave president @entity81 's a ' disrespectful ' handshake			1
it has led to speculation in @entity4 that it was done deliberately and reflects his political preference			2
no one from the @entity0 camp of the presidential palace has commented			1
this ok sign would be considered vulgar in @entity90 or @entity91 it is not only in @entity4 that greetings can prove offensive			0
in @entity95 , it is impolite not to bow lower than the other person when greeting or thanking them			0
a handshake can also be a faux pas in @entity100 if a kiss on the cheek would have been more appropriate			0
shoes and feet can be an etiquette minefield in different parts of the world			0
not taking shoes off in @entity109 or @entity110 sacred spaces is very rude			1
in @entity114 and @entity115 countries , not removing shoes when entering someone 's home is also discourteous			0
clothes are also very important in temples and churches			0
people should not enter a church in @entity121 with bare legs or arms and that rule generally applies to other religions			0
in @entity128 temples , it is important to sit with feet tucked under so that they do not point at the @entity131			0
whereas a pat on the head can is affectionate in much of the western world , it is very rude in @entity136			2
in @entity138 the head is the most pure region of the body			0
in the @entity142 and @entity143 , the humble okay sign is a positive gesture but in @entity90 and @entity91 it is seen as very vulgar			0
eating with your left hand in @entity147 and middle eastern countries is also considered rude as it is reserved for bodily hygiene and thought of as unclean			2
giving a clock or a watch as a gift in @entity155 or @entity156 may be regarded as a faux - pas , as it traditionally associated with counting the seconds to the recipient 's death .			0
