by @entity0 published : 16:39 est , 9 february 2014 @entity2 : 12:54 est , 10 february 2014 the sensation is certainly a curious one			0
it feels like someone is trying to clean my hand with the nozzle of a vacuum cleaner , but every now and then i feel a sharp prickle as though i ’ve brushed against a stinging nettle			0
i ’ve had a few unpleasant therapies in my time , but it ’s the sight of what ’s happening that ’s hardest to stomach with this			0
i ’m undergoing my first session of leech therapy			0
attached to my hand and hoovering up my blood at a rate of knots are two fat , juicy , black leeches			1
@entity0 tests out the latest new health craze for her aches and pains - and is impressed with the results when they started half - an - hour ago , they were the same thickness as a garden worm			1
but having treated the back of my hand and wrist like an all - you - can - eat buffet , they have quadrupled in size , engorged with my blood			1
@entity39 therapist @entity38 is the brains behind the @entity42 ’s first dedicated leech treatment centre , where an hour - long session costs £ 75			1
she ’s evangelical about leeches ’ healing powers and regularly undergoes treatment herself for aches and pains			1
‘ i was a beauty therapist for years , ’ she tells me			0
‘ then one day i read a story about how surgeons were using leeches in modern medicine to restore blood flow , and i quickly became fascinated by how they work			1
’ the use of leeches for blood - letting ( draining a small amount of blood from the body ) can be traced back to the 5th century , when @entity62 used them to treat conditions including headaches and gout			1
they believed leeches released impurities in the body			1
when leeches suck blood , they release anti-clotting , blood - thinning chemicals , which allow continuous blood circulation of course , it was also thought that drilling a hole in the skull would cure headaches , and red - hot irons would sort out haemorrhoids at that time			1
thankfully , times have changed but leeches are still administered — the @entity83 buys 20,000 a year			1
in most cases , they are used in plastic and reconstructive surgery			0
when leeches suck blood , they release anti-clotting , blood - thinning chemicals , which allow continuous blood circulation			1
this is vital in procedures such as skin - grafting or limb , finger and toe reattachments			1
in 2011 , when a @entity39 woman was horrifically injured in a dog attack , surgeons repaired much of the damage with the aid of more than 300 leeches			1
although a single leech only sucks blood for 20 to 40 minutes , the anti-clotting chemical they release keeps the blood flowing through the wound for at least another ten hours			1
many alternative therapists like @entity109 are convinced by the healing power of leeches for other illnesses , too			1
there are scientific studies that suggest leech therapy may be beneficial for a host of ailments , including arthritis , shingles and varicose veins			1
in one study , patients with arthritis in their knees reported no pain for an astonishing four weeks after just one treatment , thanks to the anaesthetic leeches secrete when they bite			1
other people like to use them as a beauty treatment , including @entity133 actress @entity132 , 51 , who travels to @entity134 for the leech therapy she credits for her youthful looks			2
there ’s also anecdotal evidence that leeches can help with migraines and headaches thanks to the pain - relieving chemicals in their saliva			1
there are almost 700 different species of leeches - some are land - based , some marine and some freshwater this is why i visit @entity152 — i suffer from lots of headaches , and painkillers do n’t really work for me			1
@entity157 ’s sterile , white rooms in @entity159 ’s @entity158 look much like any spa , save for a giant jar of leeches swimming in water			2
suddenly , the idea of them slithering over my face and neck does n’t exactly delight me			0
but , as it turns out , the leeches are n’t too thrilled at the prospect either			2
@entity157 had already warned me not to use any heavy perfumes or body lotions as their smell can repel the leeches , stopping them from attaching			1
i had showered that morning in nothing but warm water but the leeches still were n’t keen			2
i ’ve faced rejection in my time , but being snubbed by a leech is a new low			0
‘ sometimes leeches just do n’t take to a person , ’ says @entity157			2
‘ it might be your shampoo , what you ate last night , or it could be that your blood is too thick or too sweet			2
they like the taste of salt though , so sweaty people are good			0
’ as my neck has been rejected , @entity157 tries to attach a leech to my right hand			0
being a writer means i have a repetitive strain injury in my wrist that is getting worse			0
@entity157 assures me the leeches will sort it out — again thanks to their pain - relieving chemicals			1
a leech eventually sinks its teeth in , and i feel a sharp nip like a bee sting			0
it ’s quickly joined by another thirsty companion			0
this being my first treatment , i am only permitted to have two leeches as i am expected to bleed for a long time afterwards			2
as you have more treatments , your body builds up immunity to the leeches ’ chemicals , meaning you can subject yourself to a greater number			1
@entity157 ’s tells me her most regular client has 70 attached all over his body in a single session			2
@entity132 , 51 , travels to @entity134 for the leech therapy she credits for her youthful looks while i ’m being eaten alive , @entity157 explains that the leeches are a specially bred medical variety and supplied by a farm in @entity227			2
they are hermaphrodites , meaning they have male and female reproductive parts , and each one has 300 tiny teeth and three sets of jaws			0
at the end of their sucking session , each leech has consumed 50ml of my blood			2
i imagine they feel like i do after a big meal , when i need to undo the top button of my jeans and lie down on the sofa			0
one of them falls away naturally but the other — greedy so - and - so — refuses to budge and has to be encouraged off by @entity157 with a firm yank			2
the bad news for the leeches is that , for hygiene reasons , this feast is their last supper as they are only used once then disposed of with a generous sprinkling of kitchen salt , which makes them shrivel and die			0
after they ’re removed , the blood flows and my hand is heavily bandaged to mop up the damage			0
@entity157 tells me i should expect to bleed for 12 hours			0
the next day , the wound is still wet but the bleeding has stopped			0
the leeches have each left a distinct y - shaped mark where they sunk their teeth in — it truly looks as though i ’ve been bitten by a vampire			1
a fortnight after the treatment , the marks have still not faded — but my wrist has not hurt once			0
i ’m currently writing a book and have been typing on my laptop more than ever yet i ’ve not had a single twinge			0
maybe it ’s just the strangest of coincidences or maybe those slippery little suckers really do possess magical , if yucky , healing powers			0
@entity280 , for one , am convinced			0
