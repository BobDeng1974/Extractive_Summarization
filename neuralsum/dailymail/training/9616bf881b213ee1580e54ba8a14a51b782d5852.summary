@entity1 jewellery designer @entity0 suffered extreme postoperative delirium when @entity1 jewellery designer @entity0 came round from the general anaesthetic she ’d been given for facelift surgery in january , it rapidly became clear something was wrong			1
the married mother - of - three , a wealthy socialite , awoke gripped by panic , fought with a nurse , then fled from a security guard and climbed to the top of the hospital block			1
there , the 53 - year - old stripped naked and leapt to her death			2
in april this year , a coroner ’s inquiry in @entity19 ruled that @entity0 ’s death in @entity21 was accidental and ‘ linked to her suffering a postoperative neurobehavioral disturbance ’			1
in @entity1 , the condition is commonly known as postoperative delirium			1
@entity0 ’s death appears to have been an extreme case			1
but according to the @entity32 treatment watchdog @entity30 ( the @entity30 ) , the condition in its milder forms can affect up to half of patients who undergo surgery in @entity1			2
too often , the symptoms go entirely unrecognised and unreported , says @entity30			0
it is believed to be a specific problem with general anaesthetics but not local , arising because of the time spent in a deep state of unconsciousness			2
research shows that patients with acute forms may not recognise even close family			0
they may become paranoid , developing an extreme and irrational fear or distrust of people			2
other symptoms may include restless behaviour , sleepiness or physical changes such as difficulty in walking , swallowing or speaking			0
for many the symptoms are mild and last only hours or days			0
but one in 20 who develops the condition suffers symptoms for a month or more , according to the @entity32			0
in extreme cases the condition may cause changes in personality , such as easygoing people becoming aggressive — and it may leave them mentally debilitated for life , with memory and attention problems			2
doctors have known about postoperative delirium since the @entity69 , though debate continues about its exact causes			1
until recently , @entity72 was thought unlikely to be responsible			0
surgeons pointed to alternative causes , including the theory that the stress of surgery may exacerbate existing brain problems such as depression or early - stage dementias			2
research shows that patients with acute forms of postoperative delirium may not recognise even close family			1
they may become paranoid , developing an extreme and irrational fear or distrust of people but in recent years , evidence has emerged that the risk of postoperative delirium rises when patients are given substantial doses of anaesthetics that put them into deep states of unconsciousness , rather than lighter doses that induce ‘ regional anaesthesia ’ to block sensations from specific areas of nerves , as happens in epidurals			1
in a study at @entity103 , in @entity104 , @entity105 , researchers compared 57 elderly hip surgery patients given low doses of the drug propofol as a regional anaesthetic with 57 patients given large doses of the same drug as a general anaesthetic			1
eleven of the patients given local anaesthetic became delirious after the operation , compared with 23 of the general anaesthetic patients			1
however , other theories suggest that some people ’s brains are more vulnerable to harm caused by anaesthetic drugs than others			1
this may be especially true of older people			0
anaesthetics are believed to work by targeting proteins on the surface of neurons ( nerve cells ) that are essential for controlling functions such as sleep , attention , learning and memory			0
ageing brains tend to have fewer proteins on these neurons , so anaesthetics may somehow overpower the neurons and cause lasting damage			0
anaesthetics are also thought to work by disrupting communications between regions of the brain , and this may also induce unconsciousness			0
in some people , the brain is thought to have more trouble re-establishing communications after the patient has come round			0
a @entity153 study followed 225 patients aged 60 and over , for a year after heart surgery			2
in tests of memory and attention , those who did not develop delirium generally took less than a month to recover mentally			2
but those who had suffered post-op delirium for more than three days after surgery had still not regained their mental powers a year later , suffering problems similar to those found in the early stages of dementia			1
such studies have prompted experts to suggest that the anaesthetics cause problems with ageing brain cells ’ ability to communicate with each other , which may affect people from their mid- 40s onwards			0
children ’s growing brains can also be seriously disrupted by surgery — a condition called paediatric anaesthesia emergence delirium			1
in may , a study by experts at @entity183 found that up to one child in five may show behavioural problems a week after going under general anaesthetic to have teeth taken out			1
now , new research from the same hospital suggests children may be spared the worst effects of post-op delirium by giving them a sedative called an a2 - adrenergic agonist while they are under the anaesthetic			1
@entity195 , who led the analysis , says this may reduce their risk of emerging from surgery in a state of traumatised delirium			1
this class of drug has been found to protect brain cells from damage when the brain is anaesthetised			0
in april ’s edition of the @entity208 , dr @entity195 adds that previous studies indicate that the drug may slow children ’s recovery slightly , though she does n’t believe this delay will cause problems			0
dr @entity214 , a consultant in intensive care at @entity216 , maintains that the @entity32 can do much more to prevent postoperative delirium			1
she is currently researching whether a statin drug may relieve symptoms — @entity220 may help by reducing inflammation in the brain , she says			0
such inflammation can cause nerve damage			0
but it is not yet certain what causes it — the trauma of surgery , the anaesthetic or a combination of both			2
meanwhile , dr @entity214 says , simple steps such as ensuring patients drink enough water can make a huge difference			0
good hydration helps to improve blood flow to the brain			0
getting patients out of bed can help them regain their sense of orientation , while sleeping well helps them regain their bearings			0
in the case of postoperative delirium , such straightforward care can make the difference between a healthy recovery and long - term mental problems — or even fatal tragedy .			1

@entity0 was given a general anaesthetic for facelift surgery
she awoke gripped by panic and jumped off top of hospital block
@entity0 ’s death appears to have been an extreme case of postoperative delirium
doctors have known about postoperative delirium since the *fifties*
