by @entity0 published : 09:09 est , 1 september 2012 updated : 11:56 est , 1 september 2012 a cruise line company left in disrepute over claims one of its ships ignored pleas for help from a stricken fishing boat has fought back , saying it can prove the allegations to be false			1
six months after two @entity12 fishermen died at sea , @entity10 says it has new information to counter accusations of distress signals being ignored , which have landed the company in a court battle			1
in statement released on thursday the @entity20 - based liner operator said that it compared a video of the fishermen 's boat when it was found off @entity25 with a photograph of the boat taken by birdwatchers aboard the @entity29 off @entity12 last march and concluded they were not the same			1
dispute : @entity10 says the photographs taken by birdwatchers on board the ship do not match video footage of the fishing boat @entity38 was one of the passengers who spotted the tiny fishing boat while bird watching but his messages to the captain did not get through the video , taken by someone on the fishing boat that rescued survivor @entity47 , clearly shows the name ' @entity49 ' painted in big red letters on the bow , while the photo of the boat taken from the deck of the @entity29 does not			1
the birdwatchers notified the ship 's crew that men on the small boat were signaling and appeared to be in trouble , but the ship never changed course to help them			2
princess has said that word never reached the captain , and the crew on the bridge saw no signs of distress			2
@entity47 and the families of the two fishermen who died are suing the cruise line			1
the 18 - year - old @entity73 and his companions , @entity75 , 16 , and @entity76 , 31 , set off for a night of fishing on february 24 from @entity78 , a small fishing and farming town on the @entity80 of @entity12 that was once the site of a @entity83 base guarding the @entity84			2
their motor broke down on the way back and the men drifted at sea for weeks			0
@entity73 was rescued by a fishing boat march 22 near @entity25 's @entity91 , more than 600 miles from where they had set out			1
incredible strength : @entity47 , bottom left , survived , while his two friends were killed at sea out of mobile phone range , they had no choice but to survive on fish they had caught and hoped they would be spotted			0
since being rescued @entity104 has told how he used a piece of red cloth to try and flag the vessel down			0
@entity104 said he immediately shouted to his two friends @entity110 , 31 , and @entity111 , 16 , that he had spotted the ship			2
though very weak and near death , @entity76 also joined in by using a brightly coloured life jacket			0
the ship did n't stop , and the tiny fishing boat drifted for another two weeks before it was found			1
by then , @entity104 's two friends had died			2
' " i said , ' @entity117 will not forgive them , " ' he said , ' today , i still feel rage when i remember that			0
' @entity47 ' attorney , attorney @entity123 , said they have proof the boat seen by the birdwatchers was the same boat , including the fact that the ship passengers described a blue sailcloth or tarp aboard the vessel , of the same kind his boat had			2
' ignored sightings ' : three passengers on a deck of the @entity29 claim to have reported seeing frantic signals from those aboard the stranded fishing boat , but say the liner continued to sail on ' you can see photos in which the same characteristics are seen ... you can see the blue tarp , which had fallen down by the time of the rescue , and the poles that held it up , ' she said			1
' the cruise company is just trying to extend this , to wear us out until we give up , ' she said			0
' we are ready to fight for years			0
this is the message that we want to transmit to mankind : we can not become insensitive to human suffering			0
' this was simply condemning them to death of great suffering			0
this is not just a lawsuit against the cruise company , it is a message to mankind			0
' the cruise line said it had the video and the photo analyzed by @entity169 , a retired photo analyst and photogrammetry expert from @entity172 's @entity171 , who concluded that they were different boats			1
@entity38 , of @entity175 , @entity176 , who took photos of a small boat from the deck of the @entity29 , said he had no comment on whether it is the same boat			0
@entity29 added that the captain of the fishing boat that rescued @entity47 gave a sworn statement saying @entity47 never said anything about seeing a cruise ship pass by when he told of his ordeal			1
this map shows the ill - fated fishing boat 's movements , starting in @entity78 and ending up near the @entity91 a drift analysis charting the movements of the two boats by @entity193 , a meteorological consulting firm , concluded it was unlikely the @entity49 was the boat sighted by the passengers , @entity29 said			1
' while this remains a tragic story , we are gratified to have scientific confirmation that @entity29 was never in the vicinity of the adrift boat and that the boat photographed by our passengers was not the adrift @entity49 , ' @entity197 , president and ceo of @entity10 , said in a statement			1
' nevertheless , we have used this as a valuable learning opportunity and have strengthened our bridge reporting procedures to ensure that all messages of concern from passengers or crew are carefully evaluated by our senior bridge officers , ' he said .			0

a ship operated by @entity10 was alleged to have ignored distress signals from a stricken fishing boat
