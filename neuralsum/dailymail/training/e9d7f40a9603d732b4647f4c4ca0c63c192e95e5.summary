the @entity1 spacecraft successfully entered orbit around @entity3 this morning , making @entity6 the first @entity5 nation to reach the red planet			1
the @entity1 cost £ 45 million ( $ 74 million ) , or about three - quarters the amount to make the @entity10 - winning movie gravity about astronauts stranded in space			1
it arrived in orbit around the red planet after a tense 300 - day marathon travelling more than 420 million miles ( 670 million km )			1
pictured are @entity6 staff from the @entity22 celebrating the success of the mission just an hour after reaching the orbit , @entity6 's space agency , @entity22 , received the first photographic data of the red planet ’s terrain , which will be unveiled later this afternoon			1
@entity6 prime minister @entity30 said the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) crowned a ' near impossible ' push to become the only country to complete the trip on its maiden attempt			1
both @entity35 and the @entity36 failed their first attempts to @entity3 , while the @entity40 mission to @entity3 , dubbed @entity42 mission failed in 2011 and the @entity44 mission to @entity3 ran out of fuel			0
' history has been created today , ' said @entity30 at the state - run @entity22 ( @entity22 ) when it was announced the mission had been accomplished			2

@entity22 successfully ignited the main 440 @entity78 liquid engineand eight small thrusters that fired for 24 minutes and trimmedthe speed of the craft to allow smooth orbit insertion under @entity3 ' shadow on average , it lies 141.6 million miles from the sun. with a diameter of 4,222 miles , it ’s around half the size of the @entity88 and has an average temperature of @entity90 ( -65c )			1
gravity is much less powerful - slightly less than 40 per cent of ours			0
the atmosphere is desperately thin – one per cent of @entity88 ’s pressure – and 95 per cent of it is carbon dioxide			0
it boasts the solar system ’s biggest mountain – @entity100 , a dead volcano			0
it measures 335 miles across and rises to a height of 88,000ft , which is almost three times higher than @entity105 has two cosmic sidekicks – the moons @entity108 and @entity109			0
@entity3 ’s red colouring comes from the iron oxide that coats its surface			1
@entity3 has huge amounts of ice at its polar @entity115 they melted , it would cover the whole planet in water 11 - metres deep , according to @entity119			1
' we have dared to reach out into the unknown and haveachieved the near impossible , ' said @entity30 , wearing a symbolic redwaistcoat at the space command centre in the southern city of @entity74			2
@entity30 has said he wants to expand the country 's five - decade - old space programme			2
with a spacecraft around @entity3 , @entity6 joins a small group of nations - the @entity36 , @entity35 and @entity129 - that have successfully sent probes to orbit or land on @entity3			1
@entity22 successfully ignited the main 440 @entity78 liquid engine and eight small thrusters that fired for 24 minutes and trimmed the speed of the craft to allow smooth orbit insertion under @entity3 ' shadow			0
a confirmation of orbit entry was received at around 8 a.m. @entity6 time			0
after completing the journey in more than 10 months , the @entity1 spacecraft ( ' @entity3 craft ' in @entity144 ) will now study the red planet 's surface and scan its atmosphere for chemical methane			1
it will be examining @entity3 for methane , a key chemical in life processes on @entity88 that could also come from geological processes			1
none of the instruments will send back enough data to answer these questions definitively , but experts say the data will help them better understand how planets form and what conditions might make life possible			2
scientists said it was helpful that @entity1 's data will reflect the same time period as data being collected by @entity119 's newest maven mission , allowing the two data sets to be compared for better understanding			1
the @entity36 has two more satellites circling the planet at the moment , as well as two rovers rolling across the rocky @entity3 surface			2
the official @entity177 account of @entity119 's @entity178 - which has been on the @entity3 surface since 2012 , tweeted : ' @entity180 , @ @entity181 ! congratulations to @ @entity22 and @entity6 ’s first interplanetary mission upon achieving @entity3 orbit			1
@entity1 ’s @entity177 account replied : ' @entity186 ? keep in touch			0
' the technological triumph is fortuitously timed for @entity30 - he will be able to flaunt the achievement on a trip to the @entity36 starting on friday that includes an address to the @entity193			2
@entity119 's @entity177 account tweeted a congratulations message to @entity22 's @entity1 , to which it replied ' keep in touch			2
i 'll be around ' vigilant : @entity6 scientists and engineers from the @entity22 monitor @entity6 's @entity1 as @entity6 makes makes space history on @entity3 , @entity35 is hoping to do the same on the moon by 2030			1
the head of @entity203 , @entity202 , said plans were underway for a manned spacecraft to reach the moon by the end of the next decade			0
the system will deliver cargo and cosmonauts to the moon , and someday also into the deep space , according to @entity202			0
' based on the results of lunar surface exploration by unmanned space probes , we will designate [ the ] most promising places for lunar expeditions and lunar bases , ' @entity202 said			0
' the success of our space programme is a shining symbol of what we are capable of as a nation			0
our space programme has been an example of achievement , ' said the nationalist prime minister			2
@entity30 also holds the additional charge as @entity6 's minister of space , and in june endorsed the low - cost of the project , saying it cost even less than the budget ' gravity '			1
the @entity236 blockbuster cost about $ 100 million to make			2
@entity6 ’s @entity3 , however , has faced some criticism by critics , who have said the country could not afford to indulge in such a mission when a third of the population have no access to electricity			2
the country 's space programme was launched in the early 1960s and @entity6 developed its own rocket technology after @entity249 powers imposed sanctions for a nuclear weapons test in 1974			0
still , the country remains a small player in the global space industry that grew to £ 191 billion ( $ 314 billion ) in revenues and government budgets in 2013			0
experts say @entity3 mission success can help change that			0
' @entity22 will now hopefully attract a lot of business , ' said @entity261 , a scientist at the @entity262			0
with 30 @entity6 and 40 foreign satellite launches so far , its nearest cheap competition would be @entity40 , which is armed with bigger space launchers			0
@entity22 signed an agreement with @entity267 on friday to cooperate in research and development of various satellites			0
keen minds : @entity6 scientists and engineers of @entity22 look at a model of the @entity1 at the tracking centre in @entity74 @entity6 prime minister @entity30 in june endorsed the low - cost of the project , saying it cost even less than the budget ' gravity ' ( pictured )			1
the @entity236 blockbuster cost about $ 100 million to make having a blast : a rocket carrying the @entity6 @entity3 orbiter taking off from the east - coast island of @entity286 , @entity6 , on november 5 , 2013			1

@entity1 cost £ 45 million ( $ 74 million ) , three - quarters that of gravity
it took 300 days to travel more than 420 million miles ( 670 million km )
@entity6 prime minister @entity30 hailed it ' near impossible ' success
the spacecraft , called @entity1 , will now study red planet 's surface
spacecraft will study @entity3 for methane , a key chemical for life on @entity88
data will help scientists better understand how planets and life evolved
