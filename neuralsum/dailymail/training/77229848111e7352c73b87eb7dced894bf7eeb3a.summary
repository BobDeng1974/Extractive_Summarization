by @entity0 last updated at 4:34 pm on 6th december 2011 the nation ’s benefits bill jumped by more than £ 4billion last year with some areas claiming seven times more in handouts than others			1
the total cost was £ 121billion , according to figures from the @entity9 – up from £ 116.7billion in 2009/10			1
after pension costs are stripped out , @entity10 in @entity11 emerges as the ‘ benefits capital ’ of @entity14			1
biggest bill : @entity16 ( pictured ) in @entity11 is the ' benefits capital ' of @entity14 after amassing £ 146million in claims last year lowest cost : meanwhile , the inhabitants of the @entity21 ( pictured ) , off @entity22 , received just £ 20.1million in hand - outs last year people in the constituency pocketed £ 146million in benefits , mostly relating to unemployment and disability			1
the handouts are equal to £ 1,842 for every adult in the borough , which is one of @entity34 ’s safest seats			1
the figures do not include housing benefit , which would drive the total bill far higher			2
half of the ten constituencies with the highest benefits bills were on @entity11 , with another two in @entity41			1
the @entity10 total is more than seven times the amount claimed by residents of the @entity21 isles , off @entity22			1
the lowest benefits bill on the mainland was in @entity48 , where residents claimed £ 25.6million			1
the figure is equal to £ 352.86 for every adult in the constituency , which is a safe @entity54 seat			2
most of the areas with the lowest levels of benefits claims were leafy suburbs in the @entity60			2
employment minister @entity61 said : ‘ these figures show how important the government reforms are through initiatives like our new @entity65 , the benefit cap and @entity68			2
we are building a system that is much more fit for purpose			0
’ the figures underline the difficulty ministers have faced in trying to trim the welfare state at a time of austerity			0
rising unemployment has led to a surge in benefit claims , while efforts to get millions of people on incapacity benefits back into work are still in the foothills			0
more than five million people of working age are now on out - of - work benefits			0
the figures , which were released to @entity87 last night , will also increase @entity89 tensions over last week ’s decision to raise benefits by 5.2 per cent next year			0
many @entity54 mps are furious at the move , which contrasts sharply with a freeze in working tax credits and a 1per cent pay cap on workers in the public sector			0
critics say it undermines the government ’s pledge to ‘ make work pay ’ and undermines the incentive for the unemployed to take a job			0
the bumper increase in benefits was demanded by the @entity108 as part of the price for supporting @entity112 ’s growth plan .			0
