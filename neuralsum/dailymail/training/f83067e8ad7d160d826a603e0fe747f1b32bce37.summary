a @entity5 doctor whose close relationship with @entity3 senator @entity2 is under investigation by federal prosecutors bills the most for @entity8 in the country - and was paid a staggering $ 20.8 million by the program in 2012			1
@entity5 ophthalmologist @entity11 , whose offices were raided twice by the @entity13 last year , received the biggest sum from @entity8 , a study of physician data has revealed			1
he was among a tiny group of doctors - 344 physicians out of more than 825,000 - who were paid $ 3 million or more apiece that year , totaling at nearly $ 1.5 billion			1
the eye - watering sums were revealed by an @entity22 analysis of physician data that was released on wednesday by the @entity25 administration			1
the release was part of a move to open the books on health care financing to allow patients to make informed choices about their treatment			0
top pay : dr. @entity11 tops @entity8 's list of physicians from its claims database , getting $ 20.8 million in 2012			1
he is pictured at a book signing by @entity3 sen. @entity2 in 2010 the second highest biller was @entity40 , a cardiologist in @entity41 , @entity5 , who received $ 18.1 million , mostly from putting in stents			1
a @entity3 pathologist received $ 12.6 million performing tissue exams , and a @entity47 vascular surgeon took in $ 10.1 million			2
some of the highest billing totals may be because a doctor has an unusually large number of @entity8 patients , but in some instances , the high totals could signal fraudulent doctor behavior			2
among doctors accused of such conduct is @entity58 cancer doctor @entity57 , the seventh highest biller among the @entity8 data			1
he received $ 10 million in @entity8 payments in 2012 and is now awaiting a fraud case , after he was accused of intentionally misdiagnosing illnesses and ordering treatments for people who did not have cancer			1
he has denied any wrongdoing			0
the doctor who received the highest payout from @entity8 in 2012 - a staggering $ 20.8 million - has been a key figure in two different federal investigations			1
dr @entity11 , a 59 - year - old ophthalmologist , had his @entity5 offices raided by the @entity13 twice last year , in january and october			1
the @entity13 launched an investigation against him after he was accused of overbilling by taking one batch of medication and giving it to multiple patients , billing each one individually			2
federal rules stated that any medication left over from a single patient was supposed to be thrown out			0
@entity11 denied any wrongdoing but was forced to pay back $ 9 million he was accused of overbilling			2
his generous political contributions and close relationship with @entity3 senator @entity2 are also under investigation by federal public corruption prosecutors			1
dr @entity11 , who has said the senator is ' like a brother ' to him , has donated more than $ 700,000 to the senator 's @entity90			2
he also allowed him to use his private jet for trips to the @entity94 , but the senator was forced to pay back the cost of the travel			1
@entity11 moved to @entity5 from the @entity94 in the late 1970s and lives in a 5,000 square foot home in @entity100			1
@entity8 data shows that he billed mostly for @entity102 , which is used to treat blocked blood vessels in the eye			1
it is made by a company that pays generous rebates to its doctors			2
but speaking to the @entity110 , @entity11 's lawyer warned against presuming that the doctor 's high @entity8 bills meant he was involved in fraud			2
instead he insisted that the doctor has a large practice			0
but dr @entity11 's lawyer insisted that the physician simply led a large practice			0
@entity11 has been a key figure in two different federal investigations			0
his relationship with senator @entity2 made headlines last year after news broke that the lawmaker used the doctor 's personal jet for trips to the @entity94			1
in addition to allowing the use of his jet , the eye specialist was the top political donor for @entity2 as the @entity3 @entity133 sought re-election to the @entity135 that year			1
@entity2 's relationship with @entity11 prompted @entity138 and @entity139 investigations , and @entity2 reimbursed @entity11 more than $ 70,000 for plane trips			1
the issue exploded in late january 2013 , after the @entity13 conducted a search of @entity145 's @entity144 offices			0
@entity11 said he had done nothing wrong			0
@entity22 picked the $ 3 million threshold because that was the figure used by the @entity150 inspector general in an audit last year that recommended @entity8 automatically scrutinize total billings above a set level			1
@entity8 says it 's working on that recommendation			0
about one in four of the top - paid doctors - 87 of them - practice in @entity5 , a state known both for high @entity8 spending and widespread fraud			1
rounding out the top five states were @entity159 with 38 doctors in the top group , @entity3 with 27 , @entity161 with 23 , and @entity162 with 18			0
in the $ 3 million - plus club , 151 ophthalmologists - eye specialists - accounted for nearly $ 658 million in @entity8 payments , leading other disciplines			1
cancer doctors rounded out the top four specialty groups , accounting for a combined total of more than $ 477 million in payments			2
overall , @entity8 paid individual physicians nearly $ 64 billion in 2012			1
the median payment - the point at which half the amounts are higher and half are lower - was $ 30,265 , a tiny fraction of what its top paid received			2
@entity22 's analysis focused on individual physicians , excluding about 55,000 organizations that also appear in the database , such as ambulance services			0
none of those entities was paid $ 3 million or more			1
the @entity8 claims database is considered the richest trove of information on doctors , surpassing what major insurance companies have in their files			2
although @entity8 is financed by taxpayers , the data have been off limits to the public for decades			2
physician organizations went to court to block its release , arguing it would amount to an invasion of doctors ' privacy			0
probe : in january 2013 , an @entity13 agent is seen carrying a box of equipment into @entity11 's @entity144 , @entity5 practice after he was linked to multiple politicians through his donations investigation : law enforcement officials carry boxes following a late night raid on the offices last year employers , insurers , consumer groups and media organizations pressed for release			1
together with other sources of information , they argued that the data could help guide patients to doctors who provide quality , cost - effective care			1
a federal judge last year lifted the main legal obstacle to release , and the @entity25 administration recently informed the @entity229 it would open up the claims data			0
' it will allow us to start putting the pieces together , ' said @entity234 , a top researcher at the health care data firm @entity235			0
' that is the basis of what payment delivery reform is about			0
' doctors ' decision - making patterns are of intense interest to researchers who study what drives the nation 's $ 2.8 - trillion - a - year health care system			2
within the system , physicians act as the main representatives of patients , and their decisions about how to treat determine spending			0
the @entity229 , which has long opposed release of the @entity8 database , is warning it will do more harm than good			0
the @entity229 says the files may contain inaccurate information			0
and even if the payment amounts are correct , the @entity229 says they do not provide meaningful insights into the quality of care			0
friendship : @entity3 senator @entity2 , pictured , used dr @entity11 's private jet and stayed at his luxury home in the @entity94 - but was ordered to pay back the cost of the trip ' we believe that the broad data dump ... has significant shortcomings regarding the accuracy and value of the medical services rendered by physicians , ' @entity229 president @entity270 said			1
' releasing the data without context will likely lead to inaccuracies , misinterpretations , false conclusions and other unintended consequences			0
' the @entity229 had asked the government to allow individual doctors to review their information prior to its release			0
over time , as researchers learn to mine the @entity8 data , it could change the way medicine is practiced in the @entity293 doctor ratings , often based on the opinions of other physicians , would be driven by hard data , like statistics on baseball players			1
consumers could become better educated about the doctors in their communities			0
for example , if your father is about to undergo heart bypass , you could find out how many operations his surgeon has done in the last year			0
research shows that for many procedures , patients are better off going to a surgeon who performs them frequently			0
the data could also be used to spot fraud , such as doctors billing for seeing more patients in a day than their office could reasonably be expected to care for			2
medical practice would have to change to accommodate big data			0
acting as intermediaries for employers and government programs , insurers could use the @entity8 numbers to demand that low - performing doctors measure up			2
if the data indicated a particular doctor 's diabetic patients were having unusually high rates of complications , that doctor might face questions			0
such oversight would probably accelerate trends toward large medical groups and doctors working as employees instead of in small practices .			0
