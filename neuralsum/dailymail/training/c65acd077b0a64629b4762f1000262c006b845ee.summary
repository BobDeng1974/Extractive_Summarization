no touchline bust - ups for @entity1 , but he carried the look of a man who would n’t need much provoking after this defeat			1
@entity6 ’s night was best summed up when @entity7 had the freedom of the six - yard box at 1 - 0 down with 20 minutes remaining			1
he barely connected with his attempt at a volley			2
@entity1 looked unimpressed ; @entity12 quite relieved			1
they are good friends so there was no repeat of @entity1 ’s little tussle with @entity18 ’s @entity17 last weekend , but perhaps @entity6 could have used a spark from somewhere			1
opener : @entity22 frontman @entity21 shoots towards goal to give the @entity24 the lead against @entity6 on his knees : @entity21 slides on his knees after giving @entity12 's men the lead on 53 minutes @entity22 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity29 6 ; @entity30 5.5 , @entity31 6.5 , @entity32 7 , @entity33 6.5 ; @entity34 6 ( @entity35 46 , 6.5 ) , @entity36 6 , @entity37 6 , @entity38 5.5 ; @entity39 5.5 ( @entity40 88 ) , @entity21 6 ( @entity41 80 )			1
subs not used : @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46			2
scorer : @entity21 , 53			1
@entity12 6 booked : @entity36 @entity6 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : @entity48 6 ; perch 6 , @entity49 6.5 , @entity50 6 , @entity51 6 , @entity52 6.5 ( @entity53 76 ) ; @entity54 6.5 , @entity55 6.5 , @entity56 6 ; @entity57 6.5 ( @entity58 61 , 5.5 ) , @entity59 5.5 ( @entity60 61 , 6 ) subs not used : @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 @entity1 6 referee : @entity67 6 att : 20,622 @entity68 : @entity32 instead it came after the final whistle , again from @entity1 , who said he would have been ‘ devastated with a point ’ , such were the chances @entity6 created			1
@entity21 ’s second - half strike ensured they got nothing and @entity1 was clearly furious as he considered a third game without victory , highlighting in particular the need to find striking reinforcements from a ‘ destroyed market ’			1
‘ you think there will be more teams who dominate here like this ? ’ @entity1 said			1
‘ i do n’t think so			2
we were dominant for 90 minutes apart from putting the ball in the net			0
’ he added : ‘ when you see our last three games and especially here , everybody knows we have to do something on that part ( in attack )			0
‘ we have players who are very good , but i think we need more pace and more championship experience up front			0
that is what we will try to get			0
i know the market is more or less destroyed in the @entity102 and @entity103			0
’ @entity7 ’s miss was poor , while @entity105 and @entity60 were also wasteful			1
but to say @entity22 were lucky would be unkind and not entirely accurate			1
this is a team that , unlike @entity6 , has started the season rather well , taking seven points from three games			0
unlike @entity1 , @entity12 carried a grin as the punters left the ground			1
‘ when a football club starts winning games it creates a better atmosphere in the ground , the offices , the stadium , in the pubs , ’ @entity12 said			0
‘ we did n’t play well know we can improve			0
’ battle : @entity22 new boy @entity32 attempts to get the better of @entity6 attacker @entity105 the @entity124 has had the benefit of ‘ a hell of a lot of money ’ , as @entity1 pointed out			1
and with it he has built a strong , if unbalanced squad			0
his defence worked well last night , barring the conceded chances that sent @entity1 into a spin , but if this promotion bid falls flat it will likely be down to the depth of the back line			1
the departure of @entity139 on loan to @entity141 this week has heightened those issues , with @entity12 admitting : ‘ we really would have wanted to keep him but he wanted to go back to @entity145 for different reasons			0
sometimes you have to answer the boy ’s prayers			0
it has left us a little unbalanced in that position			0
’ but otherwise , @entity22 are in good shape , even if they are yet to find their upper gears			1
@entity37 drew an excellent save from @entity48 inside two minutes and @entity21 then fluffed his lines after a dreadful pass from @entity48 landed at his feet in the 21st minute			2
the striker had a clear path to goal but dallied and allowed @entity54 to challenge			0
hot pursuit : @entity22 striker @entity39 and @entity6 defender @entity163 race for the ball @entity57 caused @entity22 some early issues at the other end , most notably when he left @entity167 on his backside and also when he drew a fingertip save from @entity29 with a header			2
but @entity22 broke through after 53 minutes and probably deserved it			2
@entity33 delivered a cross from the left , @entity32 diverted it back across goal with the help of a @entity39 flick			0
@entity21 bundled it across the line			2
@entity6 then wasted their chances to level and @entity1 looked ready to blow			1
‘ we need to get points on the board , ’ he said			0
‘ we must not lose belief and confidence			0
’ aerial duel : @entity163 beats @entity39 in the air as the defender heads clear for @entity1 's side			2

@entity22 defeat *wigans* thanks to @entity21 winner
@entity7 missed golden opportunity to level the score
@entity1 *claims* he would have been ' devastated ' even with a point
