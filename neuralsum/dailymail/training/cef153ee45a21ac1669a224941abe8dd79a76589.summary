@entity1 's top general has said he will only recommend military action against @entity4 militants in @entity5 directly if they become a threat to the @entity1 homeland			1
general @entity8 said last night that he still believes the insurgent group is more of a regional threat and is not planning any attacks against the @entity1 or @entity12			1

general @entity8 said last night that he still believes the insurgent group is more of a regional threat and is not planning any attacks against the @entity1 or @entity12 while the @entity26 administration has so far restricted its military action against the militants to specific operations within @entity30 , concerns have increased as @entity4 militants extended their reach , taking control of a swath of land stretching from @entity5 across the border and deep into western and northern @entity30			1
the group took over @entity30 's second largest city , @entity38 , in june , and has since declared an @entity40 state , or caliphate , in territory under its control in @entity30 and @entity5			0
speaking on a military plane en route to @entity46 , @entity8 said : ' i think @entity48 has been so brutal , and has wrapped itself in a radical religious legitimacy that clearly threatens everybody i just mentioned , that i think they will be willing partners , ' said @entity8 , expressing optimism for the first time that the @entity56 nations would join in the conflict			1
he said while the @entity62 - based @entity61 , in the @entity60 , plotted and attempted attacks against the @entity1 , leading to counterterrorism strikes against the group , there had so far been no sign that the @entity4 militants were engaged in ' active plotting against the homeland , ' the @entity58 has reported			1
he said : ' i can tell you with great clarity and certainty that if that threat existed inside of @entity5 that it would certainly be my strong recommendation that we would deal with it			0
i have every confidence that the president of the @entity1 would deal with it			2
' @entity8 went on to say that the regional partners could come together and squeeze the group ' from multiple directions in order to initially disrupt and eventually defeat them			1
it has to happen with them , much less with us			0
' the @entity26 administration has so far restricted its military action against the militants to specific operations within @entity30			1
pictured is an @entity48 member in @entity90 , @entity5 most of the recent strikes have been around the @entity93 , which @entity40 militants had taken , but it is now back in the hands of the @entity30 and @entity98 troops previously , when asked about airstrikes inside @entity5 , @entity8 and defense secretary @entity100 have said all options remain on the table , although there has so far been no broader authorization for such operations			1
the @entity26 administration has authorized airstrikes within @entity30 to protect @entity1 personnel and facilities and to help @entity30 and @entity98 forces assist refugees driven from their homes by the @entity4			2

as the @entity4 militants moved across @entity30 , some @entity121 - including some members of the @entity30 security forces - either threw down their weapons or joined the group			0
@entity128 fighters stand guard at @entity93 in northern @entity30 last week the @entity1 has been encouraged as new @entity30 leaders , including @entity132 prime minister - designate @entity131 , begin to take steps to form a new government and reach out to @entity121			0
officials have suggested that any additional military assistance from the @entity1 to @entity30 is contingent on those political and diplomatic steps by the government			2
one possibility , said @entity8 , would be to have @entity1 forces provide more expanded advice and assistance to the @entity30 force			1
he said military assessment teams looked at about 50 @entity30 brigades and a number of the @entity98 units and have a good idea which ones have appropriate training and equipment and have not been infiltrated by militia			0
