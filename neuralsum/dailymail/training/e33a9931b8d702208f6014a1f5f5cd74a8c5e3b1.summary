@entity9 , 33 , has broken almost a decade of silence to reveal how his nine - man patrol became surrounded by hundreds of @entity13 troops from @entity14 's feared @entity15			1
travelling in lightly - armoured @entity17 , his pathfinder unit had been sent to assess an airfield hundreds of kilometres north of @entity20 positions to determine if it was suitable for an airborne insertion of paratroopers			1
( @entity24 picture ) : an army captain has lifted the lid on a disastrous mission at the start of the @entity5 in which he claims his unit was ' abandoned and betrayed ' by military chiefs although they had been given intelligence reports claiming the area was free from enemy units they found it was actually swarming with hostile troops			1
realising they were trapped , they called in for air support but were told nothing was available			1
their only option was to fight their way out			1
after numerous skirmishes with the enemy they eventually made it back , their vehicles riddled with bullet holes			2
the unit earned two military crosses			2
army code requires that soldiers never reveal details of such operations to the public and for nine years captain @entity58 kept the disastrous mission a secret			2
but he has now revealed all in a new @entity62 : a @entity63			2
captain @entity58 , who was injured in a later mission but recovered before leaving the army , claims he felt compelled to speak out in a bid to prevent any similar disasters in the future			2
he told the independent newspaper : ' we were massively outnumbered			2
we were abandoned and betrayed by higher command			0
' i think it is the biggest secret of the war			0
' i know i am going to get some snipes from people who think i should have kept quiet			0
it has been a lonely journey but morally it was the right thing to do			0
' the key reason was to learn lessons from the mistakes			0
' ( @entity24 picture ) : captain @entity58 claims his unit was denied air support and were left to fight their way out after being surrounded on all sides captain @entity58 's team of six @entity89 and three @entity90 were sent across the @entity92 front line to @entity94 airfield - 120km north of @entity95 in the south east of the country			1
@entity95 had seen the @entity99 advance thwarted and 29 men lost after they encountered unexpectedly strong resistance from the @entity15			0
as they reached the city , the @entity104 , in their three @entity17 armed with six machine guns , had just 12 hours to complete their mission			0
they quickly moved across the front line encountering dozens of shell - shocked @entity92 @entity99 and soon found themselves surrounded by enemy forces and fire from all sides			1
realising they were boxed in from all sides they decided their only option was to call for air support			1
captain @entity117 explained : ' i was told instantly by a senior officer there was no air			1
' it was like swallowing acid			0
it was crushing , devastating			0
we were totally on our own , abandoned			0
' after fighting their way back through five ambushes , they finally arrived at the @entity92 position where they passed on grid references of all the @entity13 units they had encountered			1
captain @entity135 added : ' the mission had failed but we had done our damnedest			0
when i thought of these amazing guys and what we had contributed to the intelligence picture , i was shaking with anger			0
