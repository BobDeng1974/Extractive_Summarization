by @entity0 scientists have discovered a number of fish - eating spiders that can consume prey twice their size and weight			1
a study by zoologists in @entity10 and @entity11 has found that while spiders typically prey on insects , some species will supplement their diet by catching small fish			2
the spiders , some of which are capable of swimming , diving and walking on the water surface , have powerful neurotoxins and enzymes that enable them to kill and digest fish that often exceed them in size			1
a study by zoologists in @entity10 and @entity11 has found that while spiders typically prey on insects , some species will supplement their diet by catching small fish @entity32 from the @entity33 in @entity11 and @entity34 from the @entity35 observed spiders from as many as five families predating on small fish in the wild across the world			2
they also examined three more spider species catching fish under laboratory conditions			0
these so called semi-aquatic spiders typically dwell at the fringes of shallow freshwater streams , ponds or swamps			1
' the finding of such a large diversity of spiders engaging in fish predation is novel , ' mr @entity32 said			0
' our evidence suggests that fish might be an occasional prey item of substantial nutritional importance			1
' the spiders , some of which are capable of swimming , diving and walking on the water surface , have powerful neurotoxins and enzymes that enable them to kill and digest fish that often exceed them in size these so called semi-aquatic spiders typically dwell at the fringes of shallow freshwater streams , ponds or swamps based on the results of the study , published by the academic journal @entity71 , naturally occurring fish predation by spiders occurs right across the world expect for @entity75			1
most incidents have been documented in @entity77 , especially in the wetlands of @entity79 , where semi-aquatic spiders have often been witnessed catching and eating small freshwater fish such as mosquitofish			0
in order to catch its prey , the spider will typically anchor its hind legs to a stone or a plant , with its front legs resting on the surface of the water , ready to ambush			0
the fish will then be dragged to a dry place before the feeding process can begin which usually lasts several hours			0

zoologists from @entity11 and @entity10 observed five different species of fish - eating spiders across the world
spiders have powerful neurotoxins and enzymes that enable them to kill and digest fish
semi-aquatic spiders dwell in freshwater streams , ponds or swamps
evidence suggests fish may be of ' substantial nutritional importance '
