car manufacturers are always looking for ways to make driving safer and in the future , dashboard emotion detectors could search for signs of irritation in a bid to identify the first signs of road rage			0
a prototype of the device is able to read a driver ’s facial expressions using a tiny embedded camera			1
they believe their technology could be of use in medicine , marketing , gaming and in driver safety			2
‘ we know that in addition to fatigue , the emotional state of the driver is a risk factor , the researchers said			1
‘ @entity47 , in particular , can make drivers more aggressive and less attentive , ’ they added			0
the scientists worked with @entity50 to create the prototype , which had to overcome the challenge of measuring emotions in the confines of a small space without distracting the driver			1
researchers at @entity15 's @entity57 came upon the idea of adapting a facial detection device for use in a car by using an infrared camera placed behind the steering wheel			1
here , the device shows a driver with a ' neutral ' expression researchers at @entity15 ’s @entity57 came upon the idea of adapting a facial detection device for use in a car by using an infrared camera placed behind the steering wheel			1
‘ the problem was to get the device to recognise irritation on the face of a driver , ’ they said , because everyone expresses this emotional state differently			1
research leaders @entity79 and @entity80 chose to track only two expressions : anger and disgust , whose manifestations are similar to those of anger			0
irritation makes drivers more aggressive and less attentive ( stock image ) and while the researchers wanted to track this emotion , it was difficult to develop a system that could do this , which could also fit into a small space without distracting the driver the system first learned to identify the two emotions using a series of photos of subjects making corresponding facial expressions and then the same exercise was carried out using videos			1
using this system of learning , the device could accurately detect irritation in most cases and when it failed it was because of an individual ’s way of displaying anger			2
the scientists will aim to create a system that can work in real - time with a more advanced facial monitoring algorithm			2
the team is also working on a fatigue detector that measures the percentage of eyelid closure , which could one day be used to develop a safety system to stop people falling asleep at the wheel			1
they are also striving to detect distraction and on using lip reading and voice recognition , to give more of a clue to a driver ’s mental state			0
@entity130 has launched a revolutionary safety device that scans for cyclists ( pictured ) and automatically brakes if a collision is imminent @entity130 has launched a revolutionary safety device that scans for cyclists and automatically brakes if a collision is imminent			2
the @entity138 car firm says the camera and radar - guided technology , which is being introduced into cars from may , could save hundreds of lives			0
the system comprises a radar scanner in the grille , a camera fitted in front of the rear - view mirror , and an onboard computer			2
it allows the car to identify cyclists who swerve into its path and reacts by slamming on the brakes			0
the driver is given a loud audible warning and a visible warning of a row of red lights flashing up on the windscreen			0
the new cyclist detector system comprises a radar scanner set into the car ’s grille , a camera fitted in front of the rear - view mirror , and a computerised central control unit			1
the radar measures the distance to any suspicious object while the camera compares its shape and size against an electronic visual catalogue of thousands of images – including bicycles and cyclists			0
it can even differentiate between a pedal cyclist and a motor cyclist			0
radar : computers calculate any possible collision and - if the driver ignores initial warnings - apply the brakes			0

scientists at @entity15 ( @entity15 ) , @entity16 , developed the system , which could boost road safety
prototype identifies a driver 's emotions using an infrared camera placed behind the steering wheel to film their face
device is being developed with @entity50 and researchers are also working on a fatigue detector measuring eyelid closure
