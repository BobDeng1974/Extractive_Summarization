it is a cold , spring night in the heart of @entity2 at a football ground bordering @entity4 , where @entity5 grew up , so @entity6 is in unfamiliar territory			1
but he is reluctant to leave			2
most of the rest of his party have gone but he lingers as the final minutes are played out , with the score 0 - 0			2
it has been a frustrating night for @entity13 , the club @entity6 co-owns with former @entity16 team - mates @entity14 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
a draw here at @entity21 means automatic promotion will become only an outside possibility			2
@entity17 and @entity6 attending the @entity13 game at home to @entity26 on saturday ( left to right ) @entity6 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity14 co-own the club with @entity17 ( not pictured ) @entity29 are attacking the far end of the ground and the view is obscured but , with 90 seconds remaining , the ball breaks for substitute @entity33 about 10 yards out with only the goalkeeper to beat			1
and even from @entity6 ’s long - distance view the ripple of net is immediately visible as the ball beats the keeper and @entity33 turns away to celebrate			1
@entity6 , too , punches the air , his face beaming as it once did when he scored a last - minute goal against @entity42 in april 2010			1
‘ we had to win , ’ he says , a look of real relief in his eyes			2
this must compare to watching @entity16 in a title run - in			1
‘ it ’s the same , ’ he replies nonplussed , before reconsidering			0
‘ tonight it has been worse			0
’ @entity33 ’s late goal set the wheels in motion for a fantastic run that has seen @entity29 win six on the bounce , their latest victory away at @entity58 on saturday			1
it takes them five points clear of @entity62 , who have a game in hand , at the top of the @entity67 ( four tiers below the @entity69 )			1
with one week to go promotion is well and truly in their hands			0
win at home to @entity74 on saturday and they are up			0
remarkably , @entity13 are the team who have happened upon five of the biggest names in @entity79 football as owners			1
the former @entity16 players , otherwise known as the class of ’ 92 , are products of the @entity85 era which has propelled the game into a celebrity culture			1
here , though , they seem in their element and none more so than @entity6			1
earlier @entity18 was with him			1
‘ this is going to ruin my week , this is , ’ he mutters as another chance is wasted			0
this is near the base of the football pyramid : clearly the players are a lot better than @entity100 footballers but the culture is closer to @entity102 than @entity103			0
@entity6 sits in one corner with a friend , while @entity18 , across the table with his father , @entity18 , informs him that they will be pairing up with @entity110 at a forthcoming @entity111 so @entity6 might need a stylist to keep up appearances			1
@entity6 pulls a face while the rest of the group laughs at his expense			1
meanwhile , the @entity21 committee members quietly discuss a promising first half			2
the @entity29 owners are scarcely given a second glance , though there is the occasional photo to pose for			1
a queue of fans wait for food duing the @entity128 match @entity129 , pictured with his grandsons , is a committee member and has looked after the turnstile for the past six years although yesterday ’s 2 - 1 win at @entity58 extended @entity29 ’s lead at the top , the season has been anything but a smooth ride			1
the original manager @entity138 was sacked in january and left complaining that the decision was delivered by chairman @entity140 , with the owners failing to contact him			2
both @entity17 and @entity18 say they did contact him to talk through their reasons but the offer was refused			1
‘ that was a low moment and not something we want to do often because there are good people at this level and you do n’t want them to lose their job , ’ said @entity18			1
‘ this season has been a massive learning curve			0
the biggest lesson we have learnt is we have to take a step away from the playing and coaching side			0
let the managers manage and players play			0
at this level , they are the experts , not us			0
’ the club are now managed by the duo of @entity167 and @entity168 , who won promotion from this league last season with @entity172			2
when @entity138 was in charge , @entity6 and @entity18 attended training and helped out with sessions but , under the new managers , that has come to an end			1
‘ we had become the meddling owners , everything we did n’t want to be , ’ said @entity18			1
@entity17 takes up the story			1
‘ @entity18 and @entity6 became quite involved in the first three or four months and we found that what might have been seen as a positive did n’t work out that way , ’ he said			1
‘ the players would hear different voices — one week they would be there , the next they ’re not there			0
with coaching , it ’s about consistency and repetition			0
what was seen as being assistance for the previous manager and creating a buzz just did n’t work			0
‘ the sadness of it all is that we did lose a manager and it was not something we wanted to do			0
it was not something that we felt good about			0
’ there have been other adjustments to the non-league level			2
‘ you never win away games at night in midweek , ’ said @entity18			1
‘ players are tired after a day ’s work ; often they ’ve rushed to the ground sometimes without eating properly ; naturally they fade late on			0
’ former @entity16 striker @entity209 now plays for @entity13 @entity13 's game against @entity26 on saturday was free admission for fans captain @entity213 works a night shift loading gas bottles , physically demanding work , and usually has to come off after 70 minutes in evening games to go to work			1
the owners have tried to address the fatigue problem , with the team meeting in a hotel for salad , pasta , chicken and salmon a few hours before their matches			2
‘ at the start of the season we had a perfect vision that we ’ll have the manager now for the next 20 years and we ’ll have a set of young players and they ’ll see us all the way to the @entity69 , ’ said @entity18			2
‘ but as time has gone on , we ’ve learnt from speaking to teams that have come through the divisions , like @entity237 , @entity238 and @entity239 , that you have to be ruthless			0
’ if there has been a loss of innocence , there is at least a better understanding of an owner ’s lot			0
‘ you can understand how , when emotions are running high , owners can make bad emotional decisions like bringing players in on big money and putting yourself under financial pressure , ’ said @entity18			1
‘ i can see how it runs away with you			0
when you lose a couple of games you think : “ oh , we need a new player			0
let ’s just push the budget out a little bit and we ’ll make it back here			0
” but you never make it back			0
’ @entity271 - @entity18 , @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity266 - @entity19 , @entity17 , @entity267 , @entity14 @entity6 line up for a class of ' 92 v @entity13 match last august @entity17 added : ‘ when we jumped into this we thought this is going to be a big challenge and a lot of people are going to be looking at how this goes			1
but actually , no matter what happens , if we ’re still watching this level of football in five years ’ time , we ’ll be disappointed because we wo n’t have progressed , but we ’ll still be happy every week			0
‘ it brings us back down to @entity295 might be coaching with @entity296 or @entity16 or doing a @entity85 game or @entity299 game in @entity300			2
then three days later you ’re at @entity301 away or @entity74 and there ’s a tea lady at half - time saying : “ do you want a cup of tea , love ? ” it ’s just real			2
people at this level do it for the passion of their clubs and their communities			0
and though @entity14 and @entity19 have n’t been able to attend as much , because of their coaching duties at @entity16 , @entity6 and @entity310 clearly feel the same			1
‘ at the start we asked ourselves why we were doing it , ’ said @entity18			2
‘ but when you come down to training , go to matches and mix with the supporters , it just feels real			0
‘ there ’s a simplicity at this level			0
it ’s exciting to watch			0
i know we want the game to be played in a beautiful way but there is also something beautiful about the style at this level			0
the roots of @entity79 football are actually in the @entity67			2
