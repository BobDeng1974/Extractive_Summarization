by @entity0 the @entity2 line has come under fire from the @entity4 – over concerns that human remains will be disturbed			1
the @entity7 , one of the @entity4 ’s most powerful organisations , called for ‘ ecclesiastical safeguards ’ before the @entity11 is passed into law to prevent the digging up of graves to make way for the rail line			1
the council , which is led by the archbishop of @entity18 and the archbishop of york , is fiercely opposed to the line because human remains will not be ‘ treated in a decent and reverent manner ’			0
the @entity4 wants the government to include ' ecclesiastical safeguards ' before approving the controversial £ 43bn project , ( artist 's impression pictured ) it says it can not back proposals for the £ 43 billion route unless mps change legislation to give greater protection to the graves which would have to be exhumed			1
the @entity4 is said to be keen to avoid a repeat of the excavation of @entity36 during the building of the @entity39 rail link , when graves were dug up with jcbs			2
sir @entity42 , the @entity44 mp and @entity46 ’s commissioner , told the @entity47 : ‘ i would hope @entity2 will be willing to engage and consider what they can do to mitigate the impact on churchyards and remains they may have to inter			2
' it is a serious point			0
it ’s a matter of common decency that when people are buried in consecrated ground they expect their remains not to be disturbed except in truly exceptional circumstances			0
’ according to a parliamentary submission by the @entity7 , the @entity2 line will pass through three consecrated burial grounds			1
@entity44 backbencher sir @entity42 said : ' it 's a matter of common decency that when people are buried in consecrated ground they expect their remains not to be disturbed in truly exceptional circumstances ' the expansion of @entity67 in @entity68 will require more than 30,000 graves to be exhumed at @entity70 , an 18th - century burial ground			1
and the remains of 2,600 people will have to be exhumed from a 12th - century graveyard in @entity75 , @entity76 , to make way for the line , along with remains beneath @entity80 in @entity81 where a new terminal is being built			1
a @entity84 spokesman said : ‘ throughout the development of @entity2 , burial grounds have been avoided as far as practicable			1
‘ we understand that the removal of human remains to enable @entity2 to progress is a sensitive and emotive issue , which is why this issue is specifically dealt with in the @entity93 and why @entity2 recently published a paper setting out how it would deal with affected burial sites along the route ’			2
a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ in terms of “ opposition ” , the @entity4 is not opposing @entity2 per se , rather we are petitioning for a technical change to the @entity99			2
’ other high - profile objectors have complained that the high - speed link will cause ‘ intolerable noise ’			0
a string of aristocratic families , including @entity107 and @entity108 , are among almost 2,000 petitioners lobbying @entity110 to stop the controversial scheme going ahead in its current form			0
they have joined a chorus of protest from other campaigners who argue that the line will hit property prices , carve up @entity120 ’s waterways and threaten countryside idylls			0
the @entity122 has also entered a petition			0
it demands the government backtrack on powers allowing constructors to disturb war memorials and first world war graves , without informing the @entity122 .			0

@entity4 want ' ecclesiastical safeguards ' introduced before @entity2 bill is passed
archbishops fear the train line will *destroy* several *ancient* burial grounds
one of the graveyards under threat is a 12th - century burial ground in @entity75
