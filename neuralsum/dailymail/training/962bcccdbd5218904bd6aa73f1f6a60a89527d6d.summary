by @entity0 @entity1 is name - dropping an unlikely clown to promote its new breakfast menu - @entity3			1
the fast - food chain will begin airing ads thursday that feature everyday men who happen to have the same name as the @entity3 's mascot known for his bright red hair and yellow jumpsuit			1
the marketing campaign is intended to promote @entity1 's new breakfast menu , which features novelties like a waffle taco			1
the chain , owned by @entity17 of @entity18 , @entity19 , is looking to boost sales by opening most of its roughly 6,000 @entity22 stores a few hours earlier at 7 a.m. starting this week			2
but @entity1 has a long way to go to catch up with @entity3 's , the no. 1 player in breakfast with about 31 percent of the category , according to market researcher @entity26			2
@entity3 : @entity1 's ad campaign to promote its new breakfast menu includes more than 400 men named @entity3 disclaimer : in the ad , @entity1 offers a disclaimer saying ' these @entity3 's are not affiliated with @entity33 ' the popularity of @entity36 and other items have been a consistent sales driver for @entity3 's over the years , with breakfast accounting for about 20 percent of the company 's @entity41 comparison , a @entity17 executive has said that breakfast accounted for just 4 percent of sales when it was being tested at @entity1 stores in select markets			1
that was before national marketing began , however , and @entity1 president @entity50 said in a phone interview that the goal was to get the figure to a level ' much greater than that			2
' @entity1 said the real - life @entity57 featured in its new ads were paid for their appearances			0
but @entity50 , who said he did n't know how much they were paid , insists their enthusiastic reactions to the food were real			0
@entity65 : of the ad , @entity1 president @entity50 says ' we like to do things with a wink and a smile ' breakfast : @entity1 hopes to compete with @entity3 's in the fast - food breakfast market , which the burger chain has dominated ' all of them resoundingly loved the food , ' he said			1
@entity1 's ad agency , @entity76 , found around 400 men and women with the name @entity3 , @entity80 or some variation , @entity50 said			1
a couple dozen were selected to represent different regions around the country including @entity85 , @entity86			0
; @entity87 ; @entity88 , @entity89 ; @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 , @entity93			0
the men show their approval of the food with comments like , ' it 's not messy ' and ' mmm , wow ' and ' mmm , real good ' and ' it has everything i like			0
' not ' lovin ' it ' : this @entity3 is probably less enthusiastic about @entity1 's breakfast menu than the @entity3 's in the new ad in case it was n't clear , tiny print at the end of the ad notes that , ' these @entity57 are not affiliated with @entity33 and were individually selected as paid endorsers of @entity111			1
' ' we like to do things with a wink and smile , ' @entity50 said			0
' we have a sense of humor			0
' as for @entity3 the fast - food clown , the character was first played by @entity120 in 1963			1
he was initially depicted as a character that magically pulled hamburgers and fries out of his belt			0
but the mascot eventually became a target of critics who say @entity3 's uses him to market to kids .			2

@entity1 hopes to compete with @entity3 's for dominance of the fast - food breakfast market
the taco chain will start serving breakfast at 7 a.m. this week at *restaurants* across @entity22
to promote the new breakfast menu , @entity1 found 400 men named @entity3 to appear in a new ad
the ad is a play on @entity3 's *iconic* mascot , clown @entity3
' we like to do things with a wink and smile , ' @entity1 's president said of the new ad
