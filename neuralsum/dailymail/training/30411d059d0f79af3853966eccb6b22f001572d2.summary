by @entity0 it was a simple mission : to build a half - eagle half - horse robot			1
but creating @entity3 the @entity4 was hardly magical for the artists who airbrushed thousands of goose and chicken feathers one - by - one before piecing them together with tweezers			2
the animatronic beast is receiving his first makeover since a team of 20 took four months to create him for the @entity13 films 12 years ago - and this time is proving just as challenging			1
finishing touches : @entity16 tweaks @entity18 's beak before he goes on display at the @entity20 looking sharp : @entity16 ( right ) , who made @entity18 the @entity4 , has talked about how it took a team of 20 artists four months to make his coat with thousands of hand - painted feathers from chickens and geese intimidating : the famously haughty animal becomes loyal to @entity13 in the third book in the series star treatment : @entity18 has his feathers buffed , preened and replenished by @entity16 the magical creature with the wings and head of an eagle and body and tail of a horse featured in the third book of @entity43 's series , @entity42			1
@entity13 and @entity44 free the haughty @entity18 - sentenced to death for attacking a pupil - and he helps @entity13 's outlaw godfather @entity47 escape a similar fate			1
cover star : @entity18 featured in @entity42 film costume expert and ' featherologist ' @entity16 , who made the original creature , has been drafted back in to recreate one of the books ' most popular animals			1
she told @entity56 : ' @entity18 was one of the most challenging creatures i ’ve ever worked on			2
' it took almost a year and a team of 20 to build three versions of him			2
we worked closely with mechanical engineers to replicate the exact wing movement and skeleton of a real bird			0
' each version required thousands of feathers to be sorted , dyed and then individually glued in place by hand			0
' as the @entity18 on show [ in @entity74 ] is more than 12 years old now , it ’s important to refresh and replenish his coat as the glue wears and feathers come loose when he bows			1
' @entity18 ’s coat consists of thousands of real goose and chicken feathers , which were individually airbrushed with dye and then hand - glued with a spatula onto a net underneath			2
the models were mechanically fitted so the wings , neck , eyes and beak could all move			0
in other scenes , the @entity4 was created digitally and the cast were given props such as a beak on a stick with which to interact on set			0
ms @entity98 , who also worked on @entity99 the phoenix and @entity101 the owl , said despite her experience @entity18 - who is the size of a real horse - took another three months to replenish			1
loyalty : the film version of @entity42 starred @entity108 @entity109 : the bird appears in @entity111 the gamekeeper 's pumpkin patch but is sentenced to death for an attack painstaking : ms @entity98 said she had to paint the feathers individually and put them in place with tweezers project : the magical creature has the wings and head of an eagle and body and tail and hind legs of a horse some of the feathers on @entity18 's wings are even more complex , as they were made out of plastic using a mould			1
ms @entity98 added : ' i ’ve worked in the industry specialising in fur and feathers for over 30 years working on a range of films from @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145			0
' the model is being re-feathered and preened for the @entity20 near @entity147 , @entity148			0
holders of an £ 89 family ticket will be able to see ms @entity98 and her team live at work from april 4 to april 27			0
the eight @entity13 films grossed an estimated £ 4.6billion at box offices worldwide - with hundreds of millions more in dvd sales and merchandise			0
@entity157 : ms @entity98 has worked on several similar creatures including @entity101 the owl cages : ms @entity98 will be demonstrating her skills at the tourist attraction next month			0

the magical creature was designed to be half - horse and half - giant eagle
it took a year to make three models which were *kitted* out as animatronics
@entity18 will have his first ' makeover ' for 12 years at @entity74 tourist show
