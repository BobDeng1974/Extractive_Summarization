a new study of the tectonic plates that make up @entity2 has revealed just how tempestuous the @entity4 one was			2
researchers say massive mountains rising between colliding plates , volcanoes belching lava and giant faults slicing the crust were found as the continent originally formed			0
researchers even say an unusual magnetic signal near @entity15 shows the peninsula stuck to @entity18 's heel like a piece of old tape about 300 million years ago , when the central and southern @entity21 were built			1
the @entity23 is a geological feature that snakes from @entity25 across @entity26 , and offshore to @entity28 's @entity27			0
anomalies in @entity2 's magnetic field are caused by structures such as faults , and by the varying magnetic intensities of different rock types - showing just how the continent was formed			2
for hundreds of millions of years , the southern continents of @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , and @entity41 were united in the supercontinent @entity42			1
while the causes for @entity42 's fragmentation are still debated , it is clear that the supercontinent first split along along the @entity48 coast in a western and eastern part before separation of @entity37 from @entity38 took place			1
today 's continental margins along the @entity53 and the subsurface graben structure of the @entity55 in the @entity48 continent , extending from @entity57 northwards to @entity58 , provide key insights on the processes that shaped present - day @entity38 and @entity37			1
in fact , the rocks beneath @entity15 suggest the peninsula originally was n't part of @entity18 at all			0
it 's a fragment of either @entity38 or @entity37 , sutured onto the southeastern @entity67 near an unusual feature called the @entity23 , researchers say			2
' the repeated cycles of plate tectonics that have led to collision and assembly of large supercontinents and their breakup and formation of new ocean basins have produced continents that are collages of bits and pieces of other continents , ' researchers led by @entity70 of the @entity26 wrote			0
in many cases , the rocks involved in these collision and pull - apart episodes are still buried deep beneath the @entity2 's surface , so geologists must use geophysical measurements to study these features			0
the new study by @entity70 of the @entity26 examines a prominent swath of lower - than - normal magnetism — known as the @entity23 — that stretches from @entity25 through @entity26 and off shore to the @entity28 coast			0
@entity70 has analyzed the detailed characteristics of the magnetic anomalies from data collected across zones in @entity26 and concludes that the @entity23 has a deeply buried source			0
the anomalous magnetic signal is consistent with an older tectonic event — the @entity105 that formed the @entity106 when the supercontinent of @entity108 was assembled			2
@entity70 's main conclusion is that the rocks responsible for the @entity23 mark a major fault - zone that formed as portions of @entity38 and @entity18 were sheared together roughly 300 million years ago — and that more extensive evidence for this collision are preserved along this zone			1
one interesting implication is that perhaps a larger portion of what is now @entity38 was left behind in the @entity37 southeast when @entity108 later broke up - including @entity15			2
how @entity37 could have ruled the world : this image shows how the @entity2 might have looked if @entity38 had been split in two			2
the move would have left a huge ocean south of today 's @entity125 desert , creating a @entity53 and a @entity125 @entity53 the huge upheavals occured millions of years ago when eastern @entity18 was part of @entity42 and @entity108 , the supercontinents that formed as @entity2 's tectonic plates collided , split apart , and then crashed together again before rifting and drifting toward the spots where they 're located today			1
@entity40 researchers say the break - up of the supercontinent @entity42 about 130 million years ago could have lead to a completely different shape of the @entity48 and @entity37 continent			1
they say the move would have left a huge ocean south of today ’s @entity125 desert , creating a @entity53 and a @entity139			0
geoscientists from the @entity141 and the @entity142 used sophisticated plate tectonic and three - dimensional numerical modelling to recreate the shift - but with a different twist			2
the researchers say the shift that left @entity38 it its present location was almost very different			0
' extension along the @entity53 and @entity153 rift systems was about to split the @entity48 - @entity37 part of @entity155 into nearly equal halves , generating a @entity53 and a @entity139 ' , geoscientist @entity150 said			1
' in a dramatic plate tectonic twist , however , a competing rift along the present - day @entity159 @entity53 margins , won over the @entity153 rift , causing it to become extinct , avoiding the break - up of the @entity48 continent and the formation of a @entity164			1
' how the @entity2 looks today : researchers say a minor change in the twist of a tectonic plate could have led to a very different @entity38 the team say their study highlights the importance of rift orientation relative to extension direction as key factor deciding whether an ocean basin opens or an aborted rift basin forms in the continental interior			0
for hundreds of millions of years , the southern continents of @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , and @entity41 were united in the supercontinent @entity42			1
while the causes for @entity42 's fragmentation are still debated , it is clear that the supercontinent first split along along the @entity48 coast in a western and eastern part before separation of @entity37 from @entity38 took place			1
today 's continental margins along the @entity53 and the subsurface graben structure of the @entity55 in the @entity48 continent , extending from @entity57 northwards to @entity58 , provide key insights on the processes that shaped present - day @entity38 and @entity37			1
the @entity53 part of this giant rift system evolved into an ocean basin , whereas its northern part along the @entity196 became stuck			0
the team say their complex numerical models gave a simple explanation : the larger the angle between rift trend and extensional direction , the more force is required to maintain a rift system			0
the @entity153 rift featured a nearly orthogonal orientation with respect to westward extension which required distinctly more force than its ultimately successful @entity159 @entity53 opponent .			0

break - up of the supercontinent @entity42 130 million years ago caused major tectonic upheaval
would have dramatically altered shape of the @entity48 and @entity37 continent
