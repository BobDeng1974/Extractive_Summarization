by @entity0 published : 05:53 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 03:34 est , 18 april 2013 three sisters who brought their 80 - year - old mother into @entity3 after a fall and watched her condition deteriorate over one week have spoken about the trauma of watching a parent pass away , whatever their age			1
@entity8 was admitted to @entity9 after she 'd had a fall in her south - east @entity12 home and , unable to get up , had lain on the floor alone for six hours			1
@entity8 finally managed to contact a doctor , who visited , checked her over and sat her back in bed , but when @entity8 's three daughters @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 arrived they were horrified at how unwell their mother looked , immediately phoning an ambulance to take her to @entity3			1
the ' @entity24 ' episode of 24 hours in @entity3 features siblings @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 speaking to @entity26 , @entity18 said : ' she was very ill since the october before the february in 2012 when she went in			1
she had bad lungs , a hip replacement , two valves in her heart , pneumonia twice , skin complaints , a hameatoma in her leg , chest infections ... there were lots of issues			1
' she hated going in to hospitals , though , because she did n't want to be a burden ! she always found some way of getting out of going in , and if she was in she 'd lie in order to escape			1
' but when we saw her after her fall we knew she was deteriorating			2
we knew immediately , in our heart of hearts , that something was very wrong			2
' @entity8 , whose story has been documented in 24 hours in @entity3 which airs tonight on @entity49 , was admitted to hospital and her daughters were told that if her condition worsened she would not be put on a ventilator or resuscitated since there was nothing that could be done - it would only prolong the inevitable			1
' it was only when they said that , that we knew she was n't going to make it			2
you take people to hospital to get them better , so when the doctors - who were all absolute angels - say they 're not going to save someone , it 's a big punch			2
' trying to contemplate how you 're going to live without your mum			2
it 's hard at any age			2
it was over a year ago but i could still cry about it now			2
' it 's strange , but our dad died eight years before , and when you lose both you really do feel like an orphan			1
you still feel that loss			2
' the sisters took their mother into @entity3 after a fall and watched her condition deteriorate over one week @entity8 's three daughters and her son @entity83 chose not to tell their mother how ill she was , instead telling her everything was fine in order not to make her anxious			1
' we were devastated not to be able to properly say goodbye and that we loved her one last time , but we did n't want to all start saying it because then she would have known something bad was happening			2
' it must be awful to know you 're dying but that there 's nothing you can do about it			0
i 'd hate to be told that , and the thought of putting my children through what we went through with mum kills me			0
' but it would have been selfish to tell her what was really happening to her			0
the way we did it she was n't anxious or worried : we stayed with her in the family room all week , and we were all having the same old funny family banter we always had and doing the crossword together right up until the end ! ' in the show it looks like we were having a party round her bed , but really we just wanted her to know that we were happy and all ok and that we were there for her			1
we had to hide our crying from her to keep her calm			0
' in the end , the sisters think @entity8 had made peace with what was happening			1
@entity18 said : ' there were telltale signs			1
she held my sister 's hand and patted it in an unusual way , like she was trying to make us feel better , and she told us she loved us			0
she seemed peaceful , like she was n't fighting it			0
i hope that afterwards she met my dad up there and they 're having a good time together			0
' @entity8 's three daughters and her son @entity83 chose not to tell their mother how ill she was and she spent her last hours doing a crossword speaking about her mother as a young woman , @entity18 said : ' she was just the best mum in the world : wonderful , unselfish , always put everyone else first			1
' we were her life			0
she did n't go out dancing , she always stayed in and looked after us in our east @entity12 home			1
she was very homely , all her money went on us , buying clothes for us and cooking all the cockney recipes and telling us tales of the east end			0
' the funny thing is , our mum is the last person in the world who would ever have signed up for anything like a tv show			0
when we came into the hospital and the staff said she 'd agreed to filming we thought she must have been delirious with medication and high on oxygen			0
' but she just said , " tell the kids to eat their hearts out with @entity165 , i 'm going to be on telly before they will " , and she was right ! we still have no idea why she did it , but with all the spin - offs and media attention and interesting people we 've met ... it 's like her way of staying with us and keeping the family together			0
' the people who worked on the programme , like the hospital staff , were amazing			0
so kind and lovely and respectful			0
everyone has gone above and beyond the call of duty			0
' the thing is , @entity180 's life was always about helping others , and now this is her time			0
people are still talking about her , and if she helps just one person deal with a similar situation , that 's a good thing			0
