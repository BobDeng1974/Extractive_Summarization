the impact climate change will have on the world 's future is a subject of hot debate - some experts believe the effects will be minimal while others have predicted scenes of devastation			0
now artists have imagined how @entity17 ’s landmarks may change in a hundred years or more , including soldiers riding on camels at @entity21 ’s parade , futuristic flying cars above the @entity11 , a giant lily pond at @entity13 , and the @entity14 marooned in water			1
in different scenarios , global warming have ravaged the capital in different ways , flooding the city , or conversely turning it into a barren , desert - like wasteland			1
the city is cramped with buildings that give off an electric glow			0
as far as the eye can see there is no sign of nature			0
while some images depict the catastrophic effects of climate change other views , created from the perspective of @entity54 , reveal how towering buildings will change the capital ’s skyline			1
the realistic mock - ups were created by future forecasting company @entity59 and take into account approved planning applications in boroughs all over the capital			2
that sinking feeling : in different scenarios , global warming have ravaged the capital in different ways , flooding the @entity68 or conversely turning it into a barren desert - like wasteland			1
here , @entity13 is under water , but is being put to good use with wind turbines generating power turning up the heat : this image suggests that @entity17 will be hotter than it is now , with soldiers on camelback rising into @entity79 a wash out ? in a survey commissioned by @entity83 , around five million @entity81 said they think the capital will one day be flooded , so that @entity85 ( pictured ) might be partially under water or even a little bit like @entity88 - maybe politicians will commute by boat they include more than 100 new points of interest from @entity83 from @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity68 views , some of which are shown here			1
a study commissioned by @entity83 from the @entity99 , found 29 per cent of @entity100 believe their capital will be unrecognisable by 2030			1
incredibly , one in five people living in the capital think it would be better off as its own country			0

@entity81 predict that by 2030 free @entity114 will be everywhere and we will no longer use paper money , preferring mobile payment			2
back to basics : in an exhibition at @entity121 , visitors will be able to ‘ look into the future ’ using interactive ‘ tellscopes ’ that juxtapose images from the @entity126 ’s archive stretching all the way back to @entity128 , with modern day and 2030 @entity17			1
this is one of the most whimsical images created showing a paddy field just outside what is the @entity14 a view of the future ? while some images depict the catastrophic effects of climate change other views , created from the perspective of @entity54 , reveal how towering buildings will change the capital ’s skyline ( a view from the north said is pictured )			1
the images , which are as realistic as possible , were created by futurescasting company @entity59 and take into account approved planning applications in boroughs all over the capital controversially , more than five million people in the @entity100 believe there will be no monarchy in 15 years and one in 10 think that @entity17 will one day be waterlogged like @entity88			1

a series of events over the coming week called ‘ @entity163 ’ will play host to architecture , engineering and literary experts who will discuss what @entity17 might look like in 30 years			2
‘ with the highest view over one of the best cities in the world , there is really no better place to think about what the future holds for our society , ’ said @entity169 , ceo of @entity83 from @entity99			0

it shows people how the skyline will change and tells them about each project in detail			0
‘ for us it ’s a huge task			0

’ to support the futuristic view of what the capital might look like in 2030 @entity231 from @entity99 commissioned a survey to find out how the public think @entity17 ’s skyline and urban society will change over the next 15 years – and the results have been staggering			1
from transport and climate through to architecture and politics , the @entity236 from @entity237 explored a wide range of topics and issues			0

artists have imagined how @entity17 ’s landmarks may change in 15 years from now and much further in the future
in different scenarios , global warming has caused flooding in the city and turned it into a desert
views from @entity121 have been created showing how planned buildings will transform the skyline in 2030
these images are as realistic as possible and take into account planning *permission* for *imminent* skyscrapers
survey commissioned by @entity83 found 30 *%* of @entity100 think capital will be unrecognisable by 2030
