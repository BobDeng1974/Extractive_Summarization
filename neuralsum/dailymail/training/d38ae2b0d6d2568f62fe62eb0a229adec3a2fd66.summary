lookin like @entity16 with a jerri curl cap lol @entity19 next # highasakite # mambaout , ' he posted saturday afternoon			2
some even wonder whether this was the injury that could be the end to his extraordinary career			1
his apparent upbeat mood is a stark contrast to his emotional state immediately following the injury @entity2 's pictures show him smiling and giving the peace sign - a stark contrast to his mood immediately following injuring his ankle			1

' makes no damn sense			0
now i 'm supposed to come back from this and be the same player or better at age 35 ? ! ? ' how in the world am i supposed to do that ? ' maybe this is how my book ends			0
maybe @entity82 has defeated me			0
' but he then added , ' then again maybe not ! ' one day , the beginning of a new career journey will commence			2
today is not that day , ' he vowed			0

the pain made him think somebody kicked him , causing him to tumble to the floor			0
' i made a move that i 've made a million times , and it just popped , ' he said while appearing to bite back tears as he leaned on crutches in the @entity60 ' locker room after a 118 - 116 win over @entity14			0
the fourth - leading scorer in @entity68 history probably will miss the postseason for just the second time , even if @entity114 hangs on to the eighth spot in the @entity117 playoff race without him			0

' i certainly have done a lot of work to prepare myself			0
it 's just bad luck			2
' @entity2 , who scored 34 points despite hyperextending his left knee early in the second half , hit two free throws after apparently tearing his tendon with 3:08 to play , tying the game before hobbling to the locker room			1
his teammates then rallied past the wilting warriors , with @entity141 and @entity175 getting big baskets down the stretch before @entity143 's go - ahead free throws in the final minutes			2

see what they did , and try to improve on that			0

while @entity141 and @entity293 have missed long stretches of play with injuries , and while @entity175 struggled to get to full strength after last year 's back surgery , @entity2 played through a sprained ankle and countless minor woes , missing only two games with injuries that could sideline other players for weeks			1
after playing all 48 minutes while scoring 47 points in @entity305 on wednesday , @entity2 pushed the @entity60 relentlessly forward on one good leg against the playoff - bound @entity14			1
@entity14 got 47 points from @entity308 in a dynamic performance , but @entity2 led a 9 - 0 run by hitting consecutive 3 - pointers to tie it at 107 with 3:47 left			2
