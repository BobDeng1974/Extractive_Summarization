by @entity0 a newly discovered interview with @entity2 from 1960 can be heard for the first time , with experts hailing the find for giving a glimpse into the civil rights leader 's time in @entity9			1
@entity10 , director of the @entity11 at @entity13 's @entity12 , said the tape is significant because there are very few recordings of @entity2 detailing his activity in @entity9			1
he said : ' it 's clear that in this tape when he 's talking ... about @entity9 , he saw this as a global human rights movement that would inspire other organizations , other nations , other groups around the world , ' said @entity10 , who is also a psychologist and historian			1
' that to me is what 's remarkable about the tape			2
' many recordings of @entity2 are known to exist among hundreds of thousands of documents related to his life that have been catalogued and archived			1
scroll down to hear the interview rare : @entity2 speaks in @entity38 in 1960 , the year the interview was recorded by @entity40 's father but @entity10 said this latest find is unusual because there 's little audio of @entity2 discussing his activities in @entity9 , while two of @entity2 's contemporaries said it 's exciting to hear a little - known recording of their friend for the first time			1
the surprise and potentially lucrative discovery was made in @entity52 a few months ago			2
@entity40 was looking through dusty old boxes in his father 's attic in @entity56 when he stumbled onto something startling : an audio reel labeled , ' dr. @entity2 interview , december 21 , 1960 '			1
he was n't sure what he had until he borrowed a friend 's reel - to - reel player and listened to the recording of his father interviewing @entity2 for a book project that never came to fruition			1
in clear audio , @entity2 discusses the importance of the civil rights movement , his definition of nonviolence and how a recent trip of his to @entity9 informed his views			1
@entity40 said the recording had been in the attic for years , and he was n't sure who other than his father may have heard it			2
' no words can describe			0
i could n't believe it , ' he told @entity80 in a phone interview from his home in @entity56			2
' i found ... a lost part of history			0
' @entity85 plans to offer the recording at a private sale arranged by a @entity89 broker and collector later this month			0
@entity40 said his father , an insurance salesman , had planned to write a book about the racism he encountered growing up in @entity56 and later as an adult			0
he said his dad interviewed @entity2 when he visited the city , but never completed the book and just stored the recording with some other interviews he had done			2
@entity40 's father is now in his early 80s and under hospice care			2
during part of the interview , @entity2 defines nonviolence and justifies its practice			1
' i would ... say that it is a method which seeks to secure a moral end through moral means , ' he said			0
' and it grows out of the whole concept of love , because if one is truly nonviolent that person has a loving spirit , he refuses to inflict injury upon the opponent because he loves the opponent			0
' the interview was made four years before the @entity119 became law , three years before @entity2 's famous ' @entity122 ' speech , and eight years before his assassination			1
at one point in the interview , @entity2 predicts the impact of the civil rights movement			1
left to right : @entity128 , @entity2 , rev. @entity129 and @entity130 hold a news conference in @entity132 , @entity38 in may 1961 ' i am convinced that when the history books are written in future years , historians will have to record this movement as one of the greatest epics of our heritage , ' he said			1
@entity2 had visited @entity9 about a month before the interview , and he discusses with @entity40 's father how leaders there viewed the racial unrest in the @entity145			1
' i had the opportunity to talk with most of the major leaders of the new independent countries of @entity9 , and also leaders in countries that are moving toward independence , ' he said			0
' and i think all of them agree that in the @entity145 we must solve this problem of racial injustice if we expect to maintain our leadership in the world			0
' @entity145 rep. @entity128 , a @entity158 and lunch counter protester who worked with @entity2 while a leader of the @entity161 , said hearing @entity2 talk about the sit - ins took him back to the period when more than 100 restaurant counters were desegregated over several months			1
' to ... hear his voice and listen to his words was so moving , so powerful , ' said @entity128 , adding that @entity2 's principles of nonviolence are still relevant today			1
' i wish people all over @entity145 , all over the world , can hear this message over and over again , ' he said			0
the rev. @entity172 , who founded the @entity173 with @entity2 , agreed			2
' i ca n't think of anything better to try , ' @entity172 said of nonviolence			0
' what we 're doing now is not working			0
@entity178 , a tooth for a tooth			0
we 've got more guns than we 've ever had , and more ammunition to go with it			0
and yet , the situation worsens			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity2 's daughter @entity187 , head of @entity188 in @entity38 , said she was traveling and could n't comment on the audio			1
@entity85 is working with a @entity89 - based collector and expert on historical artifacts to arrange a sale			0
the broker , @entity194 , said he believes that unpublished reel - to - reel audio of @entity2 is extremely rare and said he 's confident of the authenticity of the recording based on extensive interviews with @entity85 , his examination of the tape and his knowledge of @entity2			1
he 's collected many of the civil rights icon 's letters and photos			1
' i was like , wow ! to hear him that crisp and clear , ' @entity194 said			0
' but beyond that , for him to speak of nonviolence , which is what he represented			0
' interviewer : ' in many of your writings , on your speeches , your talks , your lectures , you 've used the term ' nonviolence ' and ' christian love , ' what exactly does this mean ? ' @entity2 : ' well , in short , i would say ' nonviolence ' means the refusal to use violence in any way in order to achieve a social end			2
it means refusing to use external , physical violence , and also refusing to use internal violence of spirit			0
' and i would also say that it is a method which seeks to secure a moral ends through moral means , and it rules out of the whole concept of love , because if one is truly nonviolent , that person has a loving spirit , he refuses to inflict injury upon the opponent , because he loves the opponent			0
' and i think the two go together , that the idea of love is a basic part of the whole idea of nonviolence and vice versa			0
' interviewer : ' doctor , you have visited @entity9 and many of our neighbors abroad , so exactly what effect , or rather , what reaction does the @entity9 have on the @entity259 situation as it stands today in @entity145 and this country ? ' @entity2 : ' well , there 's quite a bit of interest and concern in @entity9 , or the situation in the @entity145			1
' @entity9 leaders in general , and @entity9 people in particular are greatly concerned about the struggle here and they are quite familiar with what is taking place , i just returned from @entity9 a little more than a month ago , and i had the opportunity to talk with most of the major leaders of new , independent countries in @entity9 , and also , leaders in countries that are moving toward independence , and i think all of them agree that in the @entity145 , we must solve this problem of racial injustice if we expect to maintain our leadership in the world , and if we expect to serve as a moral voice in a world that is two - thirds color			2
