by @entity0 a new cosmetic treatment aimed at boosting the sex lives of women over 40 by giving them a designer vagina without the need for surgery is to be launched in the @entity7			1
a revolutionary filler promises to ' plump up ' a woman 's most intimate areas - which can suffer loss of tone and elasticity in the same way as her face due to falling levels of oestrogen during and after the menopause			2
experts say @entity20 , given as an injection in a similar way to facial fillers , is targeted at women who have lost confidence in their body or who may have renewed interest in sex after a divorce , particularly if they have a younger partner and want to boost their sex appeal			1
unlike other ' designer vagina ' procedures , the new filler , currently in the final stages of clinical trials in @entity35 , would not require surgery so - called ' cougars ' - women who date much younger men - are on the rise in the @entity7 , with latest research showing one in 12 married women have enjoyed a relationship with someone 15 years their junior , with the artist and film director @entity50 , 46 , leading the way with her husband , actor @entity53 , 23			1
tv star @entity54 , 55 , is another poster girl for cougars , with her toyboy @entity55 , 40 , who has inspired her to get in the best shape ever			2
the trend for @entity59 waxing , laser hair removal and vajazzles has also increased a woman 's awareness of changes taking place and the possibility of improving appearance in all areas of her body			0
the product , which is nearing the final stages of clinical trials in @entity35 , is due to be unveiled tomorrow at the @entity71 and @entity72 at @entity73			1
it is expected to be available in the @entity7 in the @entity76 and cosmetic specialist and gp dr @entity77 will be offering it at her clinics in @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity81 - upon - @entity84 , in @entity85			1
dr @entity77 said : ' a woman 's vagina is a lot like the lips on the face , in that it is prone to withering and dehydration with age , particularly during and after the menopause which happens around the average age of 51 , when there is a loss of oestrogen			2
they can go rather crinkly , lose volume and look unsightly			0
hormone dips in women over 40 can cause dehydration of the genital walls ' in some cases this loss of tone can lead to discomfort when doing physical activities too			2
in the past , doctors have suggested genital rejuvenation surgery to deal with this			0
' @entity20 will allow ladies who might be divorced and embarking on a relationship with a younger man to boost that area , without surgery			1
' he 's going to be very interested in her anatomy and she is going to feel more confident			0
' if you can rejuvenate that area , then their sex lives might reignite			0
' she added : ' when i have mentioned it to patients , their first reaction is " oh my goodnesss ! " , but as we are already using @entity131 and fillers on our faces , i think boosting this area will become more acceptable as time goes on and women see what can be achieved			1
women who are looking after their bodies are already very aware of areas they are not happy with			0
' during a woman 's twenties and thirties , the vaginal walls are bathed in hormones , making them strong and robust			0
but as we enter our forties hormone levels -- namely oestrogen -- gradually start to decline			0
this causes the walls , which are comprised of mucous membranes , to become less resilient			0
@entity20 , produced by the @entity35 company @entity155 , combines @entity156 with mannitol , a natural antioxidant that is found in fruit and vegetables			1
@entity156 - which is already used in many facial fillers - behaves like a sponge and can improve water retention capabilities in the vulva - vaginal area			1
the addition of mannitol , an antioxidant , protects against the breakdown of the gel from free radical damage and preserves the hydrating effect and longevity of the treatment			0
this helps rehydrate and ' puff up ' the area to maintain elasticity , firmness , and the proper functioning of female genital tissue			1
it also helps reduce any swelling that may occur from the injections			0
@entity20 is available in two formulations : - @entity20 , for peri-menopausal women or in reproductive age suffering from dehydration of the vulva with or without irritation @entity188 - for peri-menopausal , menopausal , and women in reproductive age with signs of moderate to severe withering			2
dr @entity77 said that a local anaesthetic gel would first need to be applied before the injection , which would need to be carried out by a trained medical professional and because of the site of the injection , antibiotics would be given to the client as a precaution			0
the process should take no more than 20 minutes to complete and the effects could last between six and 12 months , or possibly up to 15 months for the @entity208 formulation , as the gel is thicker .			1
