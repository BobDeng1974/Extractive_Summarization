a paedophile was given access to children ’s homes to advise the @entity4 about child care reforms , it was claimed yesterday			1
@entity6 , who later co-founded a pro-paedophilia campaign group , interviewed vulnerable children as he researched a government report			1
the academic had already left a teaching job over complaints of child sex abuse and went on to be a founding member of the @entity15 ( @entity15 )			1
@entity6 - a founding member of the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) - advised the @entity4 on a report which led to the reform of @entity21 's children 's home , it emerged today the 1970 report , authored by a @entity4 advisory committee , credited him for his ‘ considerable assistance ’ in a chapter on training for children ’s home workers			1
at the time @entity6 was considered a leading expert on social work training and was the former director of education at the @entity32 and a consultant for the @entity35 charity			2
@entity6 was later arrested and fined £ 900 for importing child abuse images in 1992 and was cautioned for an earlier assault			1
he died in 2007 , aged 81			0
a former care professional , who asked not to be identified , said @entity6 ’s work on the @entity4 report had allowed him to ‘ network ’ at children ’s homes , previously known as approved schools			1
@entity45 is said to have visited care homes and schools around the @entity21 , including @entity47 in @entity48 , where ' appalling ' abuse was later uncovered involving 140 former residents he carried out research across @entity21 , including visits to homes in @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			2
the retired worker told @entity58 ’s today : ‘ he [ used to ] go and interview , in approved schools , individual boys and he certainly went to speak to the heads of homes			0

but by the mid- 1970s he had become a founding member of the pie , which lobbied for sex between adults and children to be decriminalised			0
