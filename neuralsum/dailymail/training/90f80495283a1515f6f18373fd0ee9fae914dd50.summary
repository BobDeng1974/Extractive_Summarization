i think we could do a deal on that			0
' he also claimed he could introduce them to senior figures in all three main political parties			0
the @entity114 understands @entity3 will feature with mr @entity41 in a @entity116 exposé due to be broadcast this week			1

mr @entity41 said he was taking legal advice on the allegations but had resigned the whip ‘ to save my party embarrassment ’			1
@entity181 : pressing ahead with a register of lobbyists he announced that he would stand down at the next election but is facing pressure from @entity42 colleagues to quit now			0
the row has led to fresh calls on @entity190 to introduce a ‘ right of recall ’ allowing voters to sack misbehaving mps and to set up an official register of lobbyists			2
last night the @entity198 affair deepened after several mps from both major parties admitted that they had joined the all - party parliamentary group ( @entity201 ) on @entity166 after being invited by the disgraced mp			2
mr @entity41 was reported to have dismissively described them as ‘ several freeloaders that would like to go to @entity166 ’ – including one who asked to take his wife			1
the mps he persuaded to join included @entity208 , the @entity24 chairman of the @entity211 select committee , and conservative mps @entity212 and @entity214			0
a @entity24 spokesman said : ' the @entity24 expects all peers to comply with the @entity217 , which is there to bring clarity to their dealings with outside commercial interests and consultancies			0

@entity24 mp @entity208 was invited to join a group representing @entity166 but was not offered a trip to the island a spokesman for mr @entity208 said he was a member of several such groups but had not been offered a visit to @entity166			2
' he fully supports @entity166 's suspension from the @entity251 which should remain until there are free and fair elections			0
this reflects the views of his @entity267 origin constituents , ' he said			0
his sister @entity268 told the newspaper that she had an interest in human rights and democracy and was keen to see discussion about @entity166 among @entity275 mps			0
mr @entity214 said it was a ' routine thing ' to sign up as a qualifying member of a new group and it had not struck him as improper and mr @entity279 said that despite knowing nothing about @entity166 it was ' not uncommon for mps to canvass other @entity199 ... to get the @entity201 off the ground '			2
mr @entity212 told the newspaper : ' i from time to time enjoy , very occasionally , doing a nice visit somewhere and if you join an @entity201 there 's always the possibility you may visit that country			0
' a review into @entity292 was announced by the commons standards committee in january following a working group set up by speaker @entity295 whose recommendations included the need for ' greater transparency			2
' the @entity166 group was never formally registered			0
the controversy has reignited calls for the government to press ahead with promised legislation both for a statutory register of lobbyists and the power for constituents to ' recall ' mps who breach the rules			0
deputy prime minister @entity181 has made clear his determination to secure the register - blaming the @entity42 for the lack of action			0
calling for cross-party talks on a register , shadow cabinet office minister @entity317 mp said : ' we have seen no action from this @entity42 - led @entity302 , despite @entity190 himself warning that lobbying was the next great scandal waiting to happen			1
' @entity322 , interim chairman of the @entity323 , said it warned in january that lobbying remained a ' significant and continuing risk to ethical standards ' but that a register would not solve all the problems .			2

lord @entity3 referred himself to watchdogs over his contact with fake lobbying company set up by undercover journalist
lord @entity15 and lord @entity72 also *implicated* in scandal
' make that ... £ 12,000 a month ' @entity17 alleged to have asked reporter
