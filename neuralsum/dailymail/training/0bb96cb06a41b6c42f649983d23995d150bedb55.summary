by @entity1 reporter published : 20:46 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 20:46 est , 21 june 2013 the father of a woman who was fatally shot by her husband in 2009 was heckled by pro-gun protesters - one of whom was eventually tasered by police - at a rally outside of the @entity11 statehouse on tuesday , which has added new fuel to the fire in the already torrid debate over gun control			1
@entity16 , whose daughter @entity17 was fatally shot by her estranged husband when she was just 29 years old , was speaking at a rally for stricter gun control measures , including additional background checks for people purchasing firearms			1
below is a transcript of some of the exchange , as captured in a video posted on @entity40 : @entity41 : we know that when there is a gun in the home of a domestic abuser , a woman is 500 times more likely to be killed — @entity48 : what kind of gun are you talking here ? @entity41 : and we know in states where there are background checks — @entity48 : a pellet gun ? or a machine gun ? what kind of guns ? @entity41 : all kinds of guns			0
@entity48 : well , it does n’t say that in your speech			0
@entity27 and his pro-gun cohorts went on to call @entity16 's speech nothing but propaganda , to which @entity16 replied , ' what happened to my daughter was n't propaganda , ' during an interview with @entity74 's @entity73 this afternoon			1
shut up ! @entity27 argues with police before being arrested for disorderly conduct and assault @entity78 - a 29 - year - old mother and nurse - was murdered by her estranged husband , @entity81 , in october of 2009 , just days after he was arrested for throwing her down a flight of stairs and strangling her the day @entity81 shot his wife , he was out of jail on $ 30 bail for the previous misdemeanor assault			1
in addition to murdering his wife , @entity81 shot her father , @entity89 , and killed himself			2
@entity16 survived the attack and then spent years lobbying for stricter domestic violence laws , arguing that if his former son - in - law had n't been out on bail after assaulting @entity95 , she might still be alive			1
' i do n't believe this bill will stop the person doing the choking , but at least when it does happen and they are arrested , they are put away , ' @entity16 said in a 2010 interview with @entity104			1
he 's since shifted his lobbying efforts to include advocating for stricter gun - control laws			2
zap ! @entity107 after a brief scuffle senator @entity109 issued a statement saying she ' hopes that everyone would be civil at all events no matter what their viewpoint is ' many of the pro-gun advocates who showed up at tuesday 's rally are supporters of @entity120 @entity11 senator @entity109 , who in april voted against a bill that would have expanded background checks to include people who buy guns online and at gun shows			0
while 40 other @entity120 and five @entity127 opposed the bill , @entity131 mayor @entity130 's pro-gun - control organization , @entity126 , has specifically targeted @entity109 by spending more than $ 400,000 on an ad campaign in her home state claiming she opposes background checks for gun - buyers			0
' i supported legislation that would have improved our background check system , ' @entity109 told the @entity140 last month			0
' these are clearly out - of - state interests coming into @entity11 spending a lot of money , and i think at the end of the day people will sort through these types of false attacks , they will examine the issue , and i trust the people of @entity11 to make their own judgments			0
' @entity153 's attack on @entity109 has only increased her fanfare amongst pro-gun advocates , many of whom started chanting her name as @entity27 harassed @entity16 at tuesday 's rally			2
' while senator @entity109 was n’t there , she hopes that everyone would be civil at all events no matter what their viewpoint is , ' @entity109 spokesman @entity160 said in a statement to the website @entity169			0
according to the local @entity171 , @entity27 was later tasered by police and arrested after an altercation with officers who were summoned by gun - control advocates to monitor the situation			2
@entity27 has been charged with one count each of disorderly conduct , resisting arrest , and two counts of simple assault , allegedly against a rally attendee and a police officer			1
he was held on $ 5,000 cash bail			0
