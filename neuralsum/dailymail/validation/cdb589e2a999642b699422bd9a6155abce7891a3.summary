we looked and could see this big disturbance quite a way out and this big black object in the middle of it			1
' we were so mesmerised , we did n't immediately think of taking pictures although we had the cameras in our hands			1

mr @entity52 said : ' i am very interested in anything regarding nessie and the history of @entity4			0
' the reason i found this image on @entity119 was that i was sitting one night at home reading about @entity57 and @entity4 on the internet and thought i would check to see if i could see something from above - and that proved to turn out well			0
