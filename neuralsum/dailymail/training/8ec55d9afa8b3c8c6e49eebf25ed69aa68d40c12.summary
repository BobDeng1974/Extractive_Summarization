by @entity0 at first glance it looks as if @entity3 might be stepping out of retirement with @entity5 - but @entity7 fans can relax in the knowledge that @entity3 is n't their first summer signing ; it 's just @entity11 going through his pre season paces			2
@entity5 's player of the year is back in training at @entity15 sporting a style that @entity3 would be proud of - given that it makes him look just like the former @entity19 captain with his slick haircut and designer stubble			1
and @entity3 - like @entity11 - has spent time on the training fields of @entity5 's base , both as an @entity19 player and when he needed to keep his fitness up during breaks in the @entity29 season while he was with @entity30			0
the @entity52 winners have a thread - bare squad putting in the hours at their @entity55 base , with the likes of @entity57 and @entity58 still at the @entity59 while @entity60 , @entity61 and others are still enjoying an extended break after their tournament exertions			0
but @entity11 still has some friends to hang around with - those that did not qualify , or were not selected for the @entity59 are back at home with him , including @entity68 , @entity42 , @entity69 and @entity70			0
are you two brothers ? @entity11 and @entity3 both at @entity15 - but 18 months apart from each other were n't you at the @entity59 ? @entity11 , @entity75 and @entity42 exchange words the boys are back in town : @entity5 's players went through an unusual session looking to build fitness unfamiliar : even injury - plagued @entity81 took part in the pre season session chums : @entity85 poses for a photo with @entity87 - who also looks a bit like @entity3 ! hands up : @entity5 's depleted squad are put through their paces at @entity15 bulking up : @entity91 hits the weights on @entity93 of pre season training unflustered : @entity69 had the summer off while his nation @entity96 struggled at the @entity59 deputy : assistant manager @entity98 oversaw the session in @entity101 's @entity59 absence			1
