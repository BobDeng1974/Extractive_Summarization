by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 motorsport boss @entity2 concedes he is under pressure to prevent the feud between @entity6 and @entity7 from boiling over , but is confident he can keep a lid on the situation			1
the duelling drivers head into this weekend 's @entity11 in @entity12 with @entity6 claiming he and @entity7 are ' still friends ' in the wake of their recent fall - out in @entity16			1
discussions have taken place between them , with more planned prior to the events at the @entity21 to ensure there is no repeat of the scenes witnessed at @entity25			0
thumbs up for now : @entity3 boss @entity2 ( left ) celebrates @entity7 's ( right ) @entity16 grand prix win but has admitted difficulties in managing the @entity29 's rivalry with @entity6 frosty : @entity7 ( centre ) and @entity6 ( left ) barely acknowledged each other on the @entity16 podium taste of victory : @entity7 celebrates his win at the @entity16 grand prix @entity6 was left fuming with @entity7 for what he suggested was a deliberate attempt to thwart his final qualifying lap , and so deny him pole position			1
it proved crucial as @entity7 won from pole , with @entity45 runner - up , resulting in a frosty podium ceremony as neither man acknowledged the other			2
whilst non-executive chairman @entity50 claims the matter has been resolved , the three - times champion also suggested given the fight for the title between the two ' alpha ' drivers , the situation would remain ' tricky ' for the rest of the season			1
as team boss , @entity2 knows he is in the spotlight and concedes that ' clearly ' he can feel the pressure mounting on his shoulders as the season progresses and incidents occur			2
' it is a matter of managing the situation , ' said @entity2 , ' in our case we adopted the philosophy of letting them race , which as a consequence means management is a bit more difficult			1
controversial : @entity7 's car ( circled ) helped prevent @entity6 ( above ) from grabbing pole in @entity16 due to the resulting yellow flags still mates : @entity6 tweeted a picture of himself and @entity7 to help rebuild the bridges between the rivals class of the field : @entity3 have won all six races so far this season , with @entity6 grabbing four of them ' but i try to be as transparent and as neutral as possible , to give guidance to a situation in a way that it is not detrimental to the team			1
' that is because our team , @entity3 , comes first and we will never accept an individual putting themselves above the team			0
' both of them know that , accept it and have adopted that philosophy			0
' it is why , when asked whether he could keep a lid on the situation , @entity2 replied : ' yes			0
' we are managing the team , they are part of the team , part of a very large organisation and i have 110 per cent confidence it will not be to the detriment of the team			0
' @entity16 was obviously a difficult one , but our sixth win in a row , so let 's continue to let them race and hopefully we 'll end the season without any incident			2
' at the moment we have quite a bit of a margin we can allow ourselves and provide a little bit of entertainment to everybody			0
' resolved : @entity3 non-executive chairman @entity50 says there are no outstanding issues between @entity7 and @entity6 but that their rivalry would remain a tricky one throughout the season what occurred in @entity16 was heightened by the fact @entity50 had revealed to an incident in the race beforehand in @entity136 that had been kept in - house			1
that was with regard to @entity6 turning up the wick on his engine to qualifying mode to keep @entity7 at bay in the closing stages , going directly against the grain as to what had previously been discussed			0
despite @entity50 letting the cat out of the bag , @entity2 sees no reason to keep @entity50 in check also			2
' @entity50 has a very important role in the team , ' insisted @entity2			2
' he is a three - time world champion , somebody who has great access to @entity6 because @entity6 accepts @entity50 's history and @entity50 's achievements in @entity156			1
' i think @entity50 probably felt a little bit let down by the emotions ( of @entity45 in @entity136 ) , and this is why i do n't think it was an unguided missile			0
it was to set the record straight			0
