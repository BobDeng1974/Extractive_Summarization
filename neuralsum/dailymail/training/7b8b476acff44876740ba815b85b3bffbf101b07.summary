by @entity0 from free money donated by the @entity7 taxpayer to paid - for trips to @entity4 , @entity1 - real name @entity1 - certainly is n't short of freebies			1
now the 16st mother - of - two has racked up yet another , after a clinic on @entity12 gave her a £ 1,000 ' @entity14 ' fat freezing laser treatment - a procedure beloved of @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 among others - for nothing			1
and not content with a single session , @entity22 says she 'll be going back for further treatments and will even pay for them herself as she attempts to shave as much as six inches off her waist			1
' a few years ago , when my mum passed away , i was really suffering from bereavement and depression set in , ' she continued			0
' i would be eating in the middle of the night sometimes and my weight really went up			0
since appearing on the tv , i have been better and have been eating healthier food and at better times			0
' i ’ve still got someway to go but clearly having the @entity45 treatment will help speed things along and give me a flatter tummy			0
' @entity45 works by freezing the fat cells that lie beneath the surface of the skin , which die after exposure to sub zero temperatures			1
relaxing : @entity22 lies back and enjoys the treatment as her £ 1,000 procedure gets underway on a diet : @entity22 says she 's losing weight ' for myself ' and not because of taunts from ' haters ' battling the bulge : @entity22 says she has lost five stone and now weighs a relatively svelte 16st over the following fortnight , the dead cells waste away and disposed of naturally by the body - resulting in between two and six inches of fat loss			1
' i hope it ’s the six inches off for me , ' added @entity22 , who says she is ' looking forward to seeing the results over the next few weeks '			2
' clearly this is just the start of losing the weight , ' she added , ' and i ’ve got to fathom that out for myself but i ’d definitely like to try it again for my thighs and love handles - if i can afford it			2
' despite being subjected to taunts about her weight after @entity77 aired in january , @entity22 says her current bid to shed the pounds has nothing to do with ' haters ' and is entirely for herself			1
' the abuse is mainly because of the benefits or because of my weight , but i did n’t have the @entity45 treatment because of the haters , i had it for me , ' she insists			1
' i ’m not interested in what those types of people think of me , only my friends and family ’s opinions count to me			0
' my kids do joke that i ’ve got bingo wings but they only say it as a joke and it does n't bother me , but maybe i ’ll come back and have @entity45 on them next			2
' she added : ' the thing why this treatment is so amazing is that it targets the bits of fat that are really hard to shift , like your tummy , love handles and bingo wings			1
' new life : @entity22 says appearing on @entity107 's @entity77 has changed her life for the better her new life as a reality tv star turned @entity4 club promoter is a far cry from her previous existence as a benefits mum , and @entity22 says it 's all down to appearing on the @entity107 documentary			2
' if you ’d said to me that i would be having this treatment in @entity12 a year ago , i would have laughed , ' she says			0
' i thought that going to a @entity12 clinic is n’t something that the likes of me could enjoy but things have changed for me so much and i now know that anyone can do this if they set their mind to it			0
' just on a regular month with no school uniforms to buy i would be spending £ 200 a week on fuel , groceries , travel and kids clubs , so a luxury like this would never have happened			0
' it ’s amazing that since the tv show i can have opportunities like this			0
