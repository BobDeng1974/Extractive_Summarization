next time you think about cheering somebody up when they are upset , perhaps it might be best to just leave them alone			0
trying to make somebody smile when they are miserable could actually make them feel worse , a study has found			1
if you force a friend to grin when they are in a bad mood then their brain starts to associate it with sadness instead of joy			2
the study found that faking a smile wo n’t cheer you up because it is just a ‘ mask ’ to inner sadness ( file picture ) and next time they smile it could bring back miserable memories instead of lifting the bad mood			1
the study suggests that the idea of grinning and bearing it might not be the best solution after all			2
it was carried out by @entity28 , an associate professor of marketing at @entity29 , who said you should wait until your unhappiness lifts before attempting a grin			1
he said : ‘ making people who are feeling bad smile could backfire and make them feel worse , because they may interpret smiling as trying to become happy			1
‘ smiling frequently would remind them of being not happy ’			0
the research team carried out three experiments : in the first 108 people completed a survey asking how often they smiled and whether they felt good about themselves			0
they also reported how happy they were with their lives in general			0
in the second experiment 63 people were shown funny pictures and were asked if they thought they were amusing			0
if you force someone to grin when they are in a bad mood , their brain starts to associate it with sadness instead of joy , the study by @entity47 associate professor @entity28 found ( file picture ) in the third 85 people were asked to list situations when they felt happy and about their overall life satisfaction			1
they were also asked to perform facial exercises to put their faces in a smile like position			0
the study results showed that if you are faking a smile then it wo n’t cheer you up and that you are just using it to ‘ mask ’ your inner sadness			1
professor @entity28 wrote : ‘ smiling by itself does not increase happiness , or wellbeing			2
‘ instead , the belief that one must already be happy when one smiles is what increases happiness , and as a result , wellbeing			0
’ professor @entity28 said that people who are naturally smiley people should carry on grinning - as it will still make them happy .			2

smiling when unhappy makes people feel worse because it is just a ' mask '
@entity47 professor said forcing a grin makes the brain link it to sadness
