by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:59 est , 21 december 2012 updated : 10:51 est , 22 december 2012 @entity2 went to war with ‘ amateur ’ @entity5 and @entity6 yesterday – attacking @entity8 ’s judgment and the impartiality of @entity11 commissioner @entity10			1
the attack comes as the @entity15 , the body representing rank - and - file officers , has ordered a review into how it handled the episode			1
the body has been accused of ' stoking up ' @entity2 's alleged bust - up , which led to him quitting the @entity20			1
at war : former conservative chief whip @entity2 , left , has launched a withering attack on the impartiality of @entity11 commissioner @entity10 , right , @entity15 chairman @entity23 said he would apologies to the politician if it was proved that he did not call police officers ' plebs '			1
the body was vocal in its opposition to @entity2 's alleged behaviour , with some branches organising protests where officers wore ' @entity35 ' t - shirts			1
friends of the former chief whip said it was ‘ mindblowing ’ that the prime minister had allowed mr @entity2 to resign despite knowing that @entity41 footage cast grave doubt on claims by police in @entity5 that he called them ‘ plebs ’			1
mr @entity2 ’s allies said he was not even allowed to see the video before he resigned but was instead left ‘ swinging in the wind ’			2
@entity50 @entity49 also called on @entity6 to suspend the two diplomatic protection officers whose log made the claims while the force runs a criminal investigation into the events of last september			0
the @entity41 footage shows mr @entity2 being refused permission to pass through the gates of @entity5 but not the blazing row the police claim then occurred , nor the members of the public who were allegedly ‘ visibly shocked ’ at the argument			2
mr @entity2 admits swearing but not using the word ‘ plebs ’			2
up to 30 @entity6 detectives are investigating after it emerged a third policeman posed as a member of public and falsely claimed to have witnessed the row in an email to @entity50 deputy chief whip @entity71			1
mr @entity8 and cabinet secretary sir @entity72 viewed the footage and concluded that it undermined the email			2
but the prime minister decided not to confront the police who were on the scene and , crucially , did not show the video to mr @entity2 to use in his defence			2
friends of the former chief whip said it was ' mindblowing ' that @entity8 , on a visit to @entity85 , allowed @entity2 to resign branding it ‘ amateur hour ’ in @entity89 , a close friend of mr @entity2 said : ‘ it is just extraordinary they did not release something that could have knocked down the central piece of evidence against him			1
all they had to do was release 30 seconds of footage			0
‘ to trade that against a wish not to upset the police seems to me to put expediency so far ahead of a sense of morality as to be mindblowing			0
‘ it raises serious questions about @entity8 ’s judgment			2
the approach was to leave this swinging in the wind rather than raise questions with the police			0
’ the source said he agreed that the two police officers who made the original claim should be suspended pending the results of the investigation			0
another @entity50 mp said : ‘ i do n’t understand why the two policemen who wrote the log have n’t been suspended while the inquiry is going on			0
‘ there are clear discrepancies between their account and the @entity41 footage			0
they seem to have a case to answer			0
’ mr @entity2 ’s allies have also let it be known that he has little faith in the impartiality of @entity11 commissioner @entity10 after he said the @entity41 evidence did not contradict the police log			1
but he has been placated by @entity6 putting deputy assistant commissioner @entity132 in charge of the probe			0
@entity41 from @entity5 , as shown on @entity135 , suggests there was not a group of tourists at the gates at the time of the incident last night , @entity5 declined to say when mr @entity2 had been given the video but pointed out that the prime minister stood by him for several weeks after the incident , despite repeated calls for his sacking			0
mr @entity8 and @entity148 mayor @entity147 both backed mr @entity10			1
a @entity5 spokesman said : ‘ the prime minister has full confidence in the metropolitan police commissioner and believes the police should be allowed to carry out the investigation			0
’ mr @entity147 ’s spokesman said : ‘ the mayor has absolute confidence in the commissioner , who has assured him that he is determined to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible			0
’ yesterday mr @entity8 revealed that he met privately with mr @entity2 last week and had been keen to keep him			1
mr @entity2 ’s allies say he would ‘ tear @entity8 ’s arm off ’ if he were offered his old job of international development secretary back in a reshuffle			1
speaking during his visit to @entity85 , mr @entity8 said : ‘ i think there is a lot of sympathy for @entity2 because the revelation about the email ... has shocked quite a lot of people			1
’ he said that he spoke to the @entity173 mp on monday , adding that he was in a ‘ calm and rational mood ’ given the ‘ disturbing revelations ’			0
@entity176 , @entity177 chairman of the @entity178 , said mr @entity10 will answer questions about the affair on january 14			0
@entity15 chief @entity23 has handed control to his successor - elect @entity182 just over a month before he is officially due to leave the role , due to ' pre-existing leave arrangements '			1
announcing a review of the body , he said : ' recent events have shown that there are issues around the way the @entity15 nationally is able to lead and co-ordinate at a national , regional and local level			2
' ' as we enter a new era , my first act as chairman is to establish this independent panel to ensure that we as the @entity15 continue to represent the interests of our members in the most effective and efficient way			0
