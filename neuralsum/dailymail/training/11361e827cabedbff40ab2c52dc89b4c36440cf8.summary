by @entity0 published : 13:19 est , 2 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:20 est , 2 february 2014 last minute : @entity3 late on wednesday executed @entity4 after the @entity6 @entity5 denied last - minute appeals that in part challenged the drug used in the execution a @entity3 death row prisoner on the phone to his attorney discussing his appeal was hauled away in the middle of the call and put to death four minutes before the @entity5 denied his final stay request			1
@entity4 , 56 , was pronounced dead at 10.20 pm after receiving a lethal dose of pentobarbital , a fast - acting barbiturate , but emails reveal that state officials were aware that the justices of the @entity5 were still considering his appeal			1
it was @entity3 's third execution since november and the third since switching to new drug , pentobarbital , for the lethal injection - which @entity30 ' legal team said might not be as pure and as potent as it should be , which could cause undue suffering			1
@entity34 ' attorneys said last week that this was the third straight case in which @entity3 has moved ahead with an execution while the case was still in court			1
while @entity3 says it 's perfectly legal to carry out executions before all appeals are exhausted , legal experts say the practice is rare			2
and the concerns from defense attorneys come as the death penalty in general is getting increased scrutiny amid separate questions about the drugs states are using to execute inmates			0
execution : @entity4 was pronounced dead at 10:20 p.m. local time on wednesday at a state prison in @entity56 after receiving a lethal dose of pentobarbital , a fast - acting barbiturate , @entity53 spokesman @entity52 said @entity34 , 56 , was put to death late wednesday after a protracted legal battle that lasted more than two decades , a legal fight that extended to his final day of life			1
@entity4 was scheduled to die at 12:01 a.m. wednesday , but various appeals pushed the case deep into the evening			1
attorneys for @entity30 made one final push just before 10 p.m. for a stay from the @entity6 @entity5 , which had already ruled on other appeals that the execution could proceed			1
timing was becoming a factor because the death warrant expired at 11:59 p.m. a new execution date would be required if @entity4 was still alive at midnight			1
the execution began at 10:11 p.m. , and @entity4 was pronounced dead at 10:20 p.m. @entity77 , an attorney for @entity30 , said he received an email at 10:30 p.m. from the @entity5 , saying the stay application was denied at 10:24 p.m. - four minutes after @entity4 was pronounced dead			1
' it 's just troubling and fundamentally lawless , ' @entity77 said			0
@entity3 attorney general @entity82 , in an emailed statement , said the state did nothing wrong			1
' the @entity5 has ruled that pending litigation is not sufficient to stop an execution , ' @entity82 wrote			1
' the legal mechanism for a federal court to stop an execution is a court - ordered stay			1
' pensive : @entity3 officials similarly executed a man named @entity95 ( pictured left and right ) before his appeals were concluded @entity82 wrote that the state ' directly asked the @entity5 if the execution of @entity4 should be stayed ; for the third time that day , the @entity5 said no. no stay of execution was in effect at the time of execution			1
' @entity3 has executed three convicted killers in the past three months			2
@entity77 said that in all three cases , appeals were still pending			0
one of the people executed was @entity95			0
a three - judge panel of the 8th @entity6 @entity112 had refused to grant a stay , but the full appeals court had not yet heard the case , circuit judge @entity110 wrote in a dissenting opinion days after that execution			1
' in my near fourteen years on the bench , this is the first time i can recall this happening , ' the judge wrote			0
@entity124 professor @entity123 said it is unusual , but not unheard of , for an execution to proceed with an appeal still pending			0
he agreed that corrections officials could reach the point of believing that enough is enough			0
' you would n't be surprised if the state felt that way , maybe with justification , but the procedure is to have a court say that , not for the state to say that , ' @entity123 said			2
final moments ; @entity4 , 56 , did not make a final statement			2
he mouthed a few words to his two witnesses , who were not identified , then breathed heavily twice and shut his eyes for good			0
@entity142 , the nation 's most active death penalty state , generally waits until all appeals are exhausted before carrying out executions			0
in a few cases , the @entity6 @entity5 has put a halt to the stream of appeals by issuing an order that it would no longer accept petitions in a case , @entity123 said			1
the court issued no such halt in @entity4 ' case			1
' what that does is sort of put a legal end to the matter , ' @entity123 said			0
attorneys for @entity30 filed several appeals in the weeks and days leading up to the execution , and on the final day			2
many centered on concerns about the way @entity3 obtains its execution drug from an unnamed compounding pharmacy			2
at least two recent executions have raised concerns about the effectiveness of drugs used in executions , putting increased scrutiny on how states carry out the death penalty			0
two weeks ago , @entity177 inmate @entity176 took 26 minutes to die by injection , gasping repeatedly as he lay on a gurney with his mouth opening and closing			0
and on january 9 , @entity184 inmate @entity183 's final words were , ' i feel my whole body burning			0
' some of the other appeals centered on that fact that @entity4 , who was black , was convicted by an all - white jury			2
@entity190 called all the appeals a ' travesty			0
' she has permanent injuries after being shot by @entity30 in the 1991 jewelry store robbery in suburban @entity195 that killed her husband , @entity196			0
@entity4 was the sixth person executed in the @entity6 in 2014 and the third in @entity3 since november @entity190 and her two adult children spent most of tuesday and wednesday at the prison in @entity56 , @entity3 , waiting through the late appeals until finally witnessing @entity4 ' death			1
' i believe it is cruel and unacceptable both to the criminal about to be executed and to the victims ' family that after endless appeals , 20 - plus years on death row and after the execution date has been set , the criminal is given hope of a stay based on absurd technical and procedural matters , ' @entity190 said			2
smulls was convicted of shooting @entity215 while robbing his jewelry store in july 1991			0
@entity190 's wife @entity217 , who was also shot during the attack , sustained permanent injuries			0
smulls was originally scheduled to die after 12:01 a.m. @entity221 on wednesday and so had his final meal of fried chicken , steak , collard greens , macaroni and cheese , candied yams , corn bread , chocolate cake , and cola on tuesday afternoon			0
@entity3 and several other states have turned to compounding pharmacies , which are not regulated by the @entity235 , to prepare drugs for executions after an increasing number of pharmaceutical manufacturers objected to their drugs being used in capital punishment			2
the increasing use of in some cases untested compounded drugs has revived the debate over the death penalty in the @entity6			2
in @entity184 , an inmate said he felt burning through his body when the drugs used to kill him were injected during an execution in early january			0
later in the month , an @entity177 man gasped and convulsed during his execution with a two - drug mix never before used in the @entity6 .			1

by the time the @entity6 @entity5 refused a last - minute request to stay the execution of @entity34 , the @entity3 inmate was already dead
his attorneys claim that it was the third straight case in which @entity3 has moved ahead with an execution while the case was still in court
@entity4 was pronounced dead at 10:20 p.m. local time on wednesday at a state prison in @entity56 after receiving a lethal dose of pentobarbital , a *controversial* fast - acting barbiturate
