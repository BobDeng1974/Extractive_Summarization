by @entity0 on my way home from @entity4 on sunday evening , i sent @entity5 a message as i do after most @entity8 games			1
normally i ’ll ask him how he felt the match went or for his views on any major talking points but this time , having watched @entity8 dismantle @entity12 , no questions needed answering			1
so i punched the words ‘ twice as good as 2009 ’ into my phone			0
i know what it is like to go to @entity18 and win by three goals but i could n’t tell you how it feels to go there , play @entity12 off the park and make them spend the last 10 minutes chasing shadows as @entity8 ’s ecstatic fans shout ‘ @entity27 ! ’ with each tormenting pass			1
@entity8 ended up four points off @entity12 when we won 4 - 1 in march 2009 , the final score was a little distorted			1
do n’t get me wrong , our display was superb but we had to deal with spells of pressure , trailed to a @entity49 penalty and only pulled away in the last 13 minutes with two goals after @entity51 had been sent off			0
i remember the celebrations in the away end being raucous and we were delighted as we walked off the pitch , yet our elation was tempered			0
we were still four points behind @entity12 , having played a game more			1
we hoped we would win the title but they still held the upper hand			0
sunday ’s performance , however , was completely different			1
@entity12 may be an inferior side to the team they were five years ago but that should not detract one bit from what @entity8 did to them			1
the intent was there from the first kick and 6 - 0 at the final whistle would n’t have been flattering			0
what ’s more , the impact of the result and performance will have been felt across @entity75 at the @entity76 , reaching @entity77 and the @entity78 in the process			1
nobody will dare underestimate @entity8 now			2
@entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 will have looked at the two games @entity8 have just faced , away trips to @entity12 and @entity86 , and probably expected them to return with , at best , four points			1
that they have come through them with six unanswered goals , maximum points and confidence soaring will be causing @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 concern			2
the more they get into this race , the more impressive @entity8 look			2
contrast : @entity35 gives his side the thumbs up as @entity98 complains to his team - mates identical : the penalties were similar , but @entity8 are far and away a better side than @entity12 this term times are changing : @entity12 fans show their emotions in the stands as their side crumbles on fire : back then , @entity109 was @entity8 's hit man			1
now @entity35 is more than filling his boots full credit to @entity112 , who is handling the situation supremely well			2
what you get with @entity112 is exactly what you see			2
in his interviews and in the technical area , he never gets over-excited , always remaining in control			0
that ’s what you want from a manager — focus and composure , a clear plan and unshakeable belief in his methods			0
he is a coach who thinks progressively , coaxing improvement from his players with encouragement and giving them opportunities			0
we get told constantly about the problems with the @entity135 game			0
how players ca n’t play the right way or retain possession , yet here is a @entity135 manager defying the critics and showing it is possible for young players to play with style and great technique			0
all yours : @entity5 celebrates as @entity98 scratches his head in dismay up and down : @entity12 are now 14 points behind @entity8 , who are now major contenders for the title he has been repaid with consistent performances and increasingly impressive results and you only have to see how @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 have come of age during this campaign , maturing from boys to men			1
@entity157 must now be a certainty to make the @entity165 squad			2
he knows how to use his explosive pace and he has an end product to go with his skill			0
@entity156 , meanwhile , is putting himself into contention to be on the plane			2
@entity171 are well stocked for full backs but if something were to happen to @entity174 or @entity175 , @entity156 should be the first port of call			2
he is more than just someone who can make a tackle and he is versatile , uses the ball well and is growing in confidence			0
in his wake : @entity156 put in a fantastic performance at @entity18 , one of many this season wing wizard : @entity8 's @entity157 has been in magnificent form in recent months as it stands : the @entity188 top four , but @entity8 's big games are at @entity190 on course for glory : @entity193 currently lead the @entity188 despite their weekend slip - up been there , done that : city won the title two years ago , can they repeat the feat ? kings of north @entity201 : @entity202 won at @entity203 to keep their title dreams alive what i like most about @entity112 is that he is brave			1
some managers wo n’t tackle issues but @entity112 is proactive			2
within weeks of getting the @entity8 job , he sent @entity210 , the @entity135 record transfer fee , out on loan to @entity213			2
the popular @entity214 , similarly , was loaned to @entity215			0
his handling of @entity35 , most impressively , was strong			0
even when @entity35 was trying to force through a move to @entity202 , @entity112 was n’t afraid to discipline him , making him train on his own after he had overstepped the mark with comments he made in the media			0
@entity112 has the trust of his players and they respond positively to how he treats them			0
he is honest and wants to help them improve			0
he places a big emphasis on having respect and the camaraderie between coaching staff and squad is evident			0
no messing around : @entity112 shipped £ 35million signing @entity210 out to @entity213 on loan immediately achievement : it took @entity233 a few years to push @entity8 up to title contenders before leaving the club in 2010 , despite winning the @entity236 in his first season in charge success elsewhere : @entity240 delivered on the cup front but only got close to the title once the great : winning the title would be on a par with @entity247 's @entity246 triumph in 1965 on a par : @entity250 's @entity236 success of 1977 would also be matched with a title win @entity8 , certainly , have the momentum with them and the biggest compliment you can give @entity112 is that he has manoeuvred the club into a position to challenge for the title so quickly ; @entity240 and @entity233 , for instance , took four seasons to get there			1
if @entity8 were to do it , the achievement would be on a par with @entity247 ’s @entity246 triumph in 1965 or @entity250 ’s @entity236 success of 1977			1
even though @entity8 have won 18 titles , this would feel like a first , such is the hunger and desire to get there			1
will they do it ? they definitely have the right weapons			0
@entity8 look strong whereas you can question their rivals : will @entity193 pay for the lack of a top - class striker ? is @entity276 ’s defence strong enough ? do @entity202 have the players to produce when it matters ? six pointer : @entity8 face @entity276 at @entity190 on april 13			1
they lost the reverse fixture 2 - 1 vital : they then host @entity193 on april 27 , who they also lost 2 - 1 to at @entity77 there will be more twists and turns and @entity8 are going to have to prepare themselves for something not going their way over the next nine games			1
how they handle a tense situation will be the real test			0
i am certain , though , that the two @entity190 games against @entity193 and @entity276 will determine the outcome of the title race			0
the best atmosphere i ever played in was in 2005 , in the @entity236 semi-final , when we beat @entity193 1 - 0 , a night when the stadium literally shook			1
should @entity8 repeat that score on april 27 the atmosphere , like sunday ’s performance at @entity18 , will be on another level			1
tough : @entity112 has made some brave decisions since being appointed @entity8 boss in 2012			1

@entity8 went to @entity18 and played @entity12 off the park
when we won 4 - 1 in march 2009 , the *scoreline* was a little distorted
the impact of sunday 's win reached the @entity313 , @entity77 and the @entity78 - @entity112 ' side are soaring with confidence
@entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 have come of age
if @entity8 were to win the league , it would be on a par with @entity247 ’s @entity246 triumph in 1965 or @entity250 ’s @entity236 success of 1977
