a chef has created a 10in - tall , half - kilogram burger piled with six forms of three different meats and containing a whopping 2,000 calories			1
the @entity5 , which costs Â£ 13.50 , is the creation of @entity7 , head chef of @entity8 , @entity9			1
he devised the mega meal - which contains two beef patties and a whole fried chicken thigh - after he was challenged by diners to create a burger containing three kinds of meat			1
the @entity5 burger features two beef burgers , homemade bacon jam , ham chunks , a whole chicken thigh , barbequed pulled pork and bacon rashers @entity25 , get set , go ! customer @entity26 gets ready to take on the mighty meat challenge the monstrous meat feast has two beef burgers weighing 220g , a layer of homemade bacon jam , 100g of ham chunks and a 150g whole battered and fried chicken thigh			1
added to that is 80g of barbequed pulled pork and four rashers of bacon all sandwiched between two brioche buns			1
with a meat equivalent of six @entity42 the burger was created after a customer presented with the restaurant 's ' @entity45 ' burger - a feast in its own right - remarked , ' it 's almost the whole damn farm			2
' mr @entity7 said : ' we are always up for a challenge and when a customer seemed disappointed by a burger that only contained beef and chicken , we knew we had to take it one step further			2
' you could say we 've taken it several steps further as there are six different forms of meat on there			0
i think it 'll keep the punters satisfied			0
' the head chef joined forces with owner @entity68 to set out to achieve what might constitute a whole farmyard of animals in one meal			2
chef @entity7 from the @entity8 restaurant in @entity9 with his mega burger encased between a semi-brioche bun are : two beef burgers weighing 220g layer of homemade bacon jam 100g of ham chunks a whole chicken thigh weighing 150g 80g of barbequed pulled pork four rashers of bacon mr @entity7 , who lives in @entity86 with his wife and eight - year - old son @entity88 , said : ' it 's amusing when people are cocky and decide to go for it , as it 's a monster of a burger and they do n't realise that			1
i have only just managed to eat it myself			0
' it 's loads of fun making stuff that 's a little bit ridiculous			0
i experiment with cooking at home too			0
' @entity88 and i will make homemade burgers stuffed with cheese and cold meats , so i think of the @entity5 burger as a supersized version of that			1
' i think @entity88 would be scared of it , to be honest , a burger the same size as his head			0
' mr @entity68 said : ' we wanted something show - stopping ; we have n't gone down the road of using crisps and sweets as toppings , where it starts to get silly			0
' all our dishes are quite fresh - tasting with just the odd strange ingredient			0
