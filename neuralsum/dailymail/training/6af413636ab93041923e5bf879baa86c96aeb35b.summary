human brains might have a @entity2 system which allows us to navigate around unfamiliar surroundings , scientists have claimed			1
they say we may possess cells that enable us to keep track of our direction , which can become disorientated when we come out of a subway station , for example			1
and further understanding of the system could help us deal with effects such as vertigo			2
a study by researchers from the @entity18 in @entity19 found that mammals have head - direction cells that work like a 3d compass system			1
researchers believe that humans might posses similar type of orientation cells			2
the findings could help pilots cope with the effects of vertigo ( stock image shown ) the study , led by graduate student @entity32 at the @entity18 in @entity33 , @entity19 and published in @entity34 , looked at cells in the brains of bats			1
earlier work by dr @entity39 of the same institution had showed that bats possessed ' place ' and ' grid ' cells that work like a gps system to keep track of their position			1
that is similar to what is found in rodents , suggesting humans , too , also had the ability to map their position in 3d space			1
' we think that this work can be relevant to other mammals , including humans , ' mr @entity32 told @entity59			2
' there is some evidence the human mind might have a similar system , but the exact mechanism of is still unknown			0
earlier this year a study suggested that bees rely on a built - in ‘ sat nav ’ system to find their way around			1
honeybees were found to make ‘ mental maps ’ of their home ranges allowing them to pinpoint destinations miles away from their hives			0
while humans , sharks and even pigeons are known to use this technique , it was popularly thought that bees rely solely on the sun ’s position to find their way back to their hive			2
dr @entity87 of @entity88 in @entity89 , said : ‘ only 50 years ago the claim any non-human animal had a cognitive map was deeply controversial because it suggested a computational theory of mind			0
the question of whether insects do is a frontier question			0
’ ' our research is the first in mammalian species that identifies this 3d system in the brain			0
' the study of a bat brain shed light on how mammals orient themselves in complex environments by relying on neurons that work in three dimensions			0
this system acts as an internal compass that gives animals - including humans - a continuous sense of direction and location as they move around			1
they found certain cells respond to the bats ' horizontal and vertical orientation and these so - called head - direction cells track direction in three dimensions as the bats manoeuvre			1
these cells create a doughnut - shaped , @entity2 neural compass that gives a precise orientation - and even enables the bat to know if it is upside down or upright			2
similarly , in humans , pilots are trained to guard against a sudden loss of vertical direction - vertigo - that renders them unable to tell ' up ' from ' down ' and sometimes even leads to crashes			1
coming up out of an underground station can produce similar confusion - for a few moments you are unsure which way to go until regaining your sense of direction			0
in both cases the disorientation is believed to be caused by a temporary malfunction of the brain 's @entity2 compass			0
' in order to start understanding brain mechanisms for 3d orientation , we need to start by identifying the basic building blocks , ' mr @entity32 added			0
in humans coming up out of an underground station can produce navigational confusion - for a few moments you are unsure which way to go until regaining your sense of direction ( stock image shown )			2
it is thought to be caused by a temporary malfunction of the brain 's @entity2 compass			0
the researchers described how the brains of bats contain neurons that sense which way the head is pointed to support navigation in 3d space			1
much research has been conducted on place and grid cells whose discoverers were awarded the 2014 @entity177			0
but until recently head - direction cells have been studied only in @entity180 settings in rats			1
the researchers described how the brains of bats contain neurons that sense which way the head is pointed			2
shown is an @entity189 fruit bat so the researchers developed a tracking apparatus that allowed them to video - monitor all the three angles of head rotation - in flight terminology , yaw , pitch and roll - and to observe the movements of freely - behaving @entity189 fruit bats			1
at the same time the bats ' neuronal activity was monitored via implanted micro-electrodes which revealed , in a specific sub-region of the hippocampal formation , cells are tuned to a particular @entity2 angle of the head			2
certain neurons became activated only when the animal 's head was pointed at that 3d angle			0
the study also revealed for the first time how the brain computes a sense of the vertical direction integrating it with the horizontal			0
in the brain compass these directions are computed separately at different levels of complexity - some operating in @entity180 and others in @entity2			0
the researchers believe the @entity180 head - direction cells could serve for locomotion along surfaces - as happens in humans when driving a car - whereas the 3d cells could be important for complex manoeuvres in space such as climbing trees or piloting an aircraft			1
they said : ' here we present the first evidence to our knowledge for a conjunctive representation of @entity236 direction in the mammalian brain which may serve as a " 3d neural compass			0
" ' they say their findings should also apply to non-flying mammals including squirrels and monkeys that jump between trees - as well as humans			1
professor @entity246 - one of the 2014 @entity248 laureates - said : ' now this blueprint can be applied to other species that experience @entity2 in a more limited sense			0

a study by the @entity18 in @entity19 has claimed that humans may have an in - built navigation system
the researchers found bats possessed compass - like ' head - direction ' cells
these worked like a gps system to keep track of their position
previous studies identified these cells in rodents , suggesting that they are common across mammals
it also suggests humans have the ability to map their position
findings could help pilots cope with the effects of vertigo
