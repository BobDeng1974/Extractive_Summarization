by @entity0 published : 02:45 est , 6 october 2012 updated : 07:22 est , 6 october 2012 controversial : health secretary @entity1 has backed calls for the abortion limit to be cut to 12 weeks health secretary @entity1 last night made a provocative call for the abortion time limit to be slashed from 24 weeks to just 12 weeks			1
mr @entity1 said he had not changed his mind since 2008 , when as a member of the @entity8 he voted in the @entity9 to halve the upper limit at which a woman can opt for a termination			0
as a newly appointed health secretary , many would have expected him to adopt a more independent line – but he has opted to be the first politician in the position for years to express such an extreme view			0
the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) called the health secretary ’s intervention ‘ insulting to women ’			1
earlier this week , new women ’s minister @entity22 also called for a reduction in the upper time limit , albeit to just 20 weeks			1
in an interview with the @entity27 newspaper , mr @entity1 denied that his stance was a consequence of his @entity31 beliefs			0
‘ everyone looks at the evidence and comes to a view about when they think that moment is , and my own view is that 12 weeks is the right point for it , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s just my view about that incredibly difficult question about the moment that we should deem life to start			2
i do n’t think the reason i have that view is for religious reasons			0
’ mr @entity1 said it was for @entity50 , not the government , to determine the law on moral issues such as abortion			2
‘ there are some issues that cut across health and morality , a bit like capital punishment does for crime , ’ he said			2
about 91 per cent of abortions happen before 12 weeks			0
but opponents said a 12 - week limit would effectively end testing for conditions such as @entity67 ’s syndrome			1
@entity18 spokeswoman @entity68 said : ‘ the politicisation of women ’s health is absolutely shocking			1
politicians talk about putting patients at the centre , which is quite right			0
how is the woman at the centre of her healthcare with something like this ? ‘ if everybody had to have abortions by 12 weeks , my worry would be that women would be rushed into making decisions			1
that ’s an absolute shocker			0
you will absolutely create mental health problems if you start dragooning women into making decisions before they have to			0
’ @entity89 , head of public policy for the @entity91 , said : ‘ what ’s disconcerting about people like @entity1 is that they do n’t seem to understand why women would need later services			1
these are often vulnerable women			0
' insulting to women ' : the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) said a 12 week limit would prevent testing for conditions such as @entity67 's syndrome ‘ they completely fail to engage with the reality of people ’s lives and their take on science seems completely wrong			1
’ @entity106 sought to play down the provocative remarks			0
a source said : ‘ mr @entity1 was expressing a personal view and there are no plans to make time in government business for a vote on the issue			0
‘ given the strong views of most @entity117 and @entity118 against any reduction , whatever @entity121 mps think it seems unlikely that there will be a change in the law			0
’ last week , pro-choice activists delivered 600 coat hangers – used by desperate women to terminate their babies before 1967 when abortion was decriminalised – to mr @entity1 ’s office to urge him to ditch his support for a lower time limit			1
in an interview during the election campaign , @entity134 said : ‘ my own view is that we do need to review the abortion limit			1
‘ i think that the way medical science and technology have developed in the past few decades mean that an upper limit of 20 or 22 weeks would be sensible			2
’ a spokesman for the @entity145 said : ‘ parliamentary practice is that any proposals to change abortion laws come from backbench members and that decisions are made on the basis of free votes			2

cutting the 24 week abortion limit to 12 would prevent testing for conditions such as @entity67 ’s syndrome
the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) described the move as ‘ insulting to women ’
