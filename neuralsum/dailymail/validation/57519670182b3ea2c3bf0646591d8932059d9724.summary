@entity0 has shelved a decision on whether water cannon can be used on the streets of @entity4 until after the election , in a major snub to @entity7			1
mrs may has refused to sign off the controversial riot control machines despite pressure from the @entity12 mayor , who last year spent £ 220,000 buying three cannon for use in public order emergencies			1
@entity17 sources confirmed last night no ruling on permission would be made this side of the election			0
that means the machines will lay idle , in a potential embarrassment for the mayor			0
@entity7 spent £ 220,000 last year buying three water cannon to use in public emergencies , such as the @entity12 riots , but @entity0 has today refused to approve their use ( file image ) soon after buying the three @entity32 machines last year , mr @entity7 said it was ‘ highly likely ’ the home secretary would sign them off , adding : ‘ my view is we need to get on and equip the police with the water cannon they need , or might need			1
’ but in the past she has expressed concerns about whether they fit with the @entity4 model of policing and is thought to have concerns about their safety			0
the standoff over the issue cast light on the ongoing rivalry between the two , both of whom are seen as potential @entity55 leadership candidates should @entity56 lose the election and step down			0
mrs may 's @entity17 has been locked in a row with the @entity12 mayor over the decision to buy the machines and whether they fit with @entity4 policing last night @entity63 sources insisted mr @entity7 had known about the timetable for some time and was ‘ very relaxed ’ about the delay			1
a spokesman for the @entity68 defended the decision to purchase the cannon , pointing towards support for them among @entity72			2
he said : ‘ independent polling shows that the majority of @entity72 support the police having water cannon at their disposal for use in exceptional circumstances			1
' the mayor has made his position clear and awaits the home secretary ’s licensing decision			2
’ but critics of cannon warn that in incidents on the continent they have led to serious injury and even death			2
in one case in @entity32 a man was blinded and in another a protester was stunned and then killed after being run over			0
water cannon have been used in @entity94 to quell public order incidents , but never on the @entity4 mainland			1
calls for their introduction came during the 2011 riots and later student protests in the capital			0
last summer @entity103 ’s spokesman also endorsed their use , saying the prime minister ‘ supports ’ the police ’s application for water cannon			1
mrs may and mr @entity7 two regularly appear at or near the top of polls on who @entity113 would like as a future leader			2
she is known to regard the mayor as a ' faintly ridiculous ' figure			0
at the time the mayor purchased the machines , he was warned it could be a waste of taxpayers ’ money			0
when mr @entity7 purchased the machines he said it was ' highly likely ' the home secretary would sign off on their use , a political gamble that seems to have backfired mr @entity7 has previously urged police to get ' medieval ' on rioters , and said officers must never again be left powerless in the face of overwhelming violence like that seen during the riots			1
but he stressed the chances of the machines being used in the capital , or other mainland cities , remained ' vanishingly rare '			0
police argue water cannon would be useful in a static confrontation where there is a need to create space between police lines and violent crowds			1
they said it could have helped protect firefighters and paramedics after shops were set ablaze as rioting spread to @entity150 in 2011 .			0

@entity7 spent £ 220,000 on buying three used water cannon last year
@entity154 was ' highly likely ' to approve their use , *sparking* a row
decision seems to have backfired after ms may refused to sign off on use
