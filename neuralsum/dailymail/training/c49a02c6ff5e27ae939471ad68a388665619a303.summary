by @entity0 the publication of the final report from the @entity3 into the @entity4 has been delayed for another year because officials are refusing to allow @entity7 's private messages to @entity8 to be released			1
the delay was announced today by inquiry chairman sir @entity10 in a letter to @entity12			1
it means the committee 's final judgement will not be delivered until at least a decade after the war			0
secret relationship : the publication of the final report from the @entity3 into the @entity4 has been delayed for another year because officials are refusing to allow @entity7 's private messages to @entity8 to be released sir @entity10 complains that the inquiry team 's ability to publish ' a balanced , fair and accurate ' report is being undermined by the refusal of @entity25 officials to let them publish the documents on which their conclusions are based			1
intelligence papers relating to @entity30 , @entity31 , the listening post @entity32 and the deliberations of the @entity35 are understood to be among the messages being held back			0
but in his letter , sir @entity10 also makes clear he wants the government to release mr @entity7 's private letters to president @entity8 , which are understood to show that he committed in principle to support a @entity42 war in @entity43 long before he came clean with the public			1
he also wants to be able to show the public details of deliberations in @entity47 over the war , which are likely to expose the true nature of the discussion over the legality of the conflict and the degree to which ministers were in the dark about the intelligence case for war			0
in a letter to mr @entity12 , sir @entity10 says there are unresolved disputes over ' a number of particularly important categories of evidence , including the treatment of discussions in the cabinet and cabinet committees and the @entity68 position in discussions between the prime minister and heads of state or government of other nations			0
' sir @entity10 explicitly says issues around mr @entity7 's evidence ' will need to be resolved '			2
facing questions : @entity7 addressing the @entity77 in january 2010			2
sir @entity10 wants the government to release mr @entity7 's private letters to president @entity8 he also refers to the inquiry 's desire to publish ' transcripts from a small number of private hearings ' - understood to include testimony from intelligence officers			1
mr @entity7 has already discussed his letters widely in his evidence and his spin doctor @entity89 reveals elements of the discussions in his diaries			1
yet @entity94 officials , led by cabinet secretary sir @entity95 and his predecessor @entity96 , have argued that publication of the letters would undermine future candour between leaders if there was a prospect of them being published			2
sir @entity10 's letter will pile pressure on mr @entity7 to grant a one - off exemption to the rules to allow publication of his correspondence with president @entity8			1
report author : sir @entity10 fears the inquiry team 's ability to publish ' a balanced ' report is being undermined @entity113 told the @entity115 panel that releasing @entity7 's notes would damage @entity68 's relations with the @entity42 and would not be in the public interest			1
' we have attached particular importance to protecting the privacy of the channel between the prime minister and president , ' he said			0
but sir @entity10 has emphasised that the protocols were ' put in place to protect national security , international relations and the personal security of individuals			0
' they are not there to prevent embarrassment			0
' the inquiry held 18 months of public hearings between the end of 2009 and early 2011 and was originally expected to publish by the summer of 2011			2
but sir @entity10 has now revealed that he will not even begin approaching witnesses the report will criticise for their comments before the middle of next year			0
that means the final report will not be published until the autumn of 2013 and potentially into 2014			1
it is expected to criticise mr @entity7 's use of intelligence about @entity148 's weapons of mass destruction in making the case for war - in particular through the creation of the so - called ' dodgy dossier '			2
sir @entity10 is on record as saying that mr @entity7 's claim that @entity31 established ' beyond doubt ' that @entity148 had weapons of mass destruction was ' not possible to make on the basis of intelligence '			0
he reveals that the report is expected to exceed one million words in length , though it will also come with a more digestible summary for the public .			0

final report may not be published until 2014
chairman complains officials are undermining inquiry
@entity7 has already discussed messages to @entity8 in public
