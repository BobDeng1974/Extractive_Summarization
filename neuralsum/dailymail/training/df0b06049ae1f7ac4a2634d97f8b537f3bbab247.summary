@entity0 made his long - awaited return from the knee injury that kept him out for nine months and wrecked his @entity4 dream as @entity6 ’s @entity5 were held by @entity7			1
the @entity9 star played 45 minutes of the match at @entity11 , easing himself back into competitive action after only returning to full training on monday			1
when @entity0 was taken off on a stretcher in @entity6 ’s @entity17 third round derby with @entity18 on january 4 , nobody could have known it would be october 17 , under the friday night lights at modest @entity21 , before we saw him again			1
@entity0 returned to action for @entity6 for the first time since injuring his knee in the @entity17 third round despite ten months out of the team the @entity6 and @entity9 star showed flashes of his best football @entity6 : @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 ( c ) ( @entity37 67 ) , @entity38 , @entity0 ( @entity39 46 ) , @entity40 ( @entity41 60 ) , @entity42 , @entity43 subs not used : @entity45 , @entity46 booked : @entity47 - @entity38 @entity7 : @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 ( @entity56 85 ) , @entity57 ( @entity58 60 ) , @entity59 ( c ) , @entity60 ( @entity61 80 ) subs not used : @entity63 , @entity64 referee : @entity66 286 days have been lost from the 25 - year - old ’s career			1
286 days of waiting for the knee ligaments to regain their strength to the point where he could accelerate away from defenders so stylishly once again			2
missing the @entity4 would have hurt , as would being absent from @entity6 ’s @entity17 triumph at @entity75 in may and @entity0 will desperately want to make up the lost time now he has returned			1
he said : ‘ it ’s just nice to get out there and do what i enjoy doing			2
i ’ve really missed it and i ’ve just wanted to get back fit			2
i ’m pleased with tonight			2
‘ it ’s important to recover well , you need to be patient			0
the manager will choose to play me when he wants , it ’s not something that will happen overnight			0
’ admitting that the nine - month absence was the hardest time in his career , @entity0 vowed to come back stronger			1
he added : ‘ it ’s been a good opportunity to work on something i 've never worked on before , my leg strength			0
that period i was at academy i missed out on , that development stage in the gym			0
you work hard with the physios , i 've managed to build myself and be stronger and fitter			0
’ this was a gentle reintroduction - there were a few tantalising glimpses of that trademark pace as he skipped away from the @entity7 defenders			0
there were also a few inaccurate passes and under - hit crosses as he tries to rediscover that sharpness , but that ’s to be expected			2
with @entity114 in the midst of a debilitating injury crisis , @entity0 ’s return to the competitive arena will be most welcome			1
@entity0 waits in the tunnel ahead of his @entity6 return against @entity7 at @entity11 @entity0 made a few mistakes but @entity114 will be encouraged by his winger 's return @entity0 posted to @entity123 thanking @entity6 fans and medical staff for sticking by him for the nine months 3 mins @entity0 ’s first burst forward with the ball , down the right , takes him past two defenders			1
a square pass to @entity40 , whose shot from the edge of the box is blocked			0
6 pass through the middle by @entity40 but @entity0 is a little slow off the mark and does n’t make the ball			1
10 tries a little flick to try and break past @entity52 but the @entity7 defender reads his intentions and clears			0
13 set free down the right by @entity42 tucked pass but low cross is cut out 20 shoots wide from the edge of the box after some eye - catching build - up work from @entity36 and @entity42 26 @entity147 - footed spin and drives through two defenders ’ challenges before @entity54 hacks it clear			0
@entity151 down the right and then almost takes in the clearance			0
ca n’t control the fast - moving ball 45 @entity0 is withdrawn at half - time and replaced by @entity39 the @entity6 boss is without @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 for saturday ’s visit of @entity162			1
every day seems to bring fresh injury headaches			0
so there is a chance he ’ll be in the squad for wednesday ’s @entity169 trip to @entity170 but , on this evidence , he perhaps needs a few more minutes under his belt before his first - team introduction			1
the first - half was a terrible spectacle , so it was a good job @entity0 was in action to excite the larger - than - usual crowd for this under 21 @entity180 match			1
@entity6 , who started the match fourth in the standings , were favourites and they made most of the running - often very quickly , with @entity43 and @entity40 causing problems with their speed			2
@entity0 ’s first involvement saw him glide down the right and find @entity40 , only for the @entity189 ’s snapshot to be blocked			2
@entity40 , himself returning from injury , then curled a 20 - yard free - kick over the perimeter fence			0
@entity43 , in excellent form this season and on target for @entity9 ’s @entity196 in recent @entity198 qualifiers , showed a fine turn of pace to ping in a cross that was cut out			1
@entity189 winger @entity40 was also returning from injury and managed an hour for the @entity203 @entity0 's injury , sustained against @entity18 in january , saw him miss last summer 's @entity4 @entity0 did see a chance come his way , after 20 minutes following good link - up play involving @entity36 and @entity42 , but he snatched at the shot			1
rovers did carry a threat at time , with the winger @entity53 particularly dangerous			0
but it was the other flanker , @entity57 whose dinked ball just eluded captain @entity59 when clean through			0
eight minutes before half - time , @entity6 keeper @entity31 saved low from @entity54 as the visitors enjoyed their best spell			2
@entity0 managed one shot that went inches wide on his return to football against @entity221 injury - prone midfielder @entity36 continued his latest comeback with another @entity224 appearance the second period was even more tepid			1
@entity48 preserved @entity7 ’s lead when he slid out to thwart @entity38 with about 20 minutes to play , before @entity43 ’s goal was disallowed for offside			0
suddenly , @entity6 stepped things up - @entity39 , who had replaced @entity0 , back - heeled into the path of @entity42 , whose powerful hit was beaten away by @entity48 at his near post			2
they went even closer when @entity42 ’s free - kick was tipped on to the crossbar in the last 10 minutes but this one ended in stalemate			0
but at least @entity6 fans have a favourite back again			0
@entity0 sprints away from @entity53 as the @entity9 international showed he still has plenty of pace			1

@entity9 forward makes first appearance since january
@entity0 starts game at @entity11 , and plays whole first half
@entity203 star could be in squad for next week 's @entity169 match
@entity0 shows flashes of his best form , but still lacks sharpness
