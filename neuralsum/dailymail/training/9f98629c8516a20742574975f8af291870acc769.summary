the @entity1 's @entity0 has recently come under fire for harrowing torture practices following the 9/11 terrorist attacks			2
but one of the prisoners accused of accused of planning and carrying out the sept. 11 terrorist attacks says he ' does not hold any grudges ' against his torturers			0
on friday , lawyers of @entity14 issued a statement in response to the @entity18 's controversial 500 - page report on the @entity0 's interrogation techniques in which they were referred to as ' deeply flawed , ' @entity12 reports			0
@entity20 , @entity14 's lead attorney , said the prisoner ' holds no grudge against the @entity0 for his torture , and saw the suffering of those who torture , ' according to @entity26			1
no @entity27 : on friday , lawyers of @entity14 ( photographed ) issued a statement in response to the recently released @entity0 ' torture ' report saying the prisoner ' holds no grudge against the @entity0 for his torture ' deeply flawed : earlier this month , the @entity18 released a controversial 500 - page report on the @entity0 's interrogation techniques in which they were referred to as ' deeply flawed , ' however , @entity20 is n't buying his client 's statements			1
@entity20 said , in the statement , that the @entity0 is using @entity39 to ' retroactively justify ' its torture program , according to @entity12			0
' the @entity0 and its defenders are using mr. @entity14 as a scapegoat for its illegal and reprehensible use of torture , ' @entity20 said			1
' the @entity46 spent incredible amounts of money , energy , and @entity46 credibility , and now the @entity0 is pointing at mr. @entity14 to justify its massive torture infrastructure			2
' justice : photographed is @entity52 at the @entity54 detention center , which is home to more than 100 prisoners being held without trial on suspicion of terrorism			0
prisoners : the @entity0 torture report has revealed that @entity61 suspects were kept awake in ' stress positions ' for 180 hours , waterboarded until they started vomiting and became unconscious , and one died of hypothermia chained naked to a floor @entity66 is the nephew of @entity67 , the self - proclaimed 9/11 mastermind			2
@entity66 is being held at @entity54 , @entity68 , charged with war crimes , and is to be tried for his alleged role in planning and carrying out the 9/11 attacks			0
@entity66 was arrested in 2003 and the @entity0 admitted to subjecting the prisoner to beatings and freezing baths			0
however , @entity26 reports that @entity20 found it strange that the ' torture report ' gave so little information about @entity39 's experience but gave so much about that of others in custody			2
the report states that at least five detainees were subjected to ' rectal feeding ' or ' rectal hydration ' in torture techniques ' far more brutal ' than previously revealed , according to @entity12			1
@entity0 : a @entity89 special investigator demanded those responsible for ' systematic crimes ' be brought to justice waterboard : the report details instances of detainees being waterboarded and subjected to ' rectal feeding ' or ' rectal hydration ' ( photographed is a demonstration by the group ' @entity100 can wait ' in @entity101 in 2008 where thy held a mock waterboarding torture of a prisoner ) the report allegedly details what interrogators did to many detainees , but provides very little information on the treatment of @entity39			1
@entity0 officials have said that @entity39 has provided them with valuable information and defenders of the ' torture program ' said that @entity14 's confessions gave information which led to the disruption of terror attack planned in @entity120			1
defenders also say that @entity14 's torture led the prisoner to giving them information that led to the capture of @entity126			0
however , the report allegedly concluded that the information had already been obtained , prior to @entity39 's torture , and had nothing to do with the prisoner 's confessions			1
the report does n't urge prosecution for wrongdoing or criminal probes , but a @entity89 special investigator demanded that those responsible ' systematic crimes ' be brought to justice .			0

lawyers of @entity14 , an alleged 9/11 *conspirator* , say the prisoner ' holds no grudge against the @entity0 for his torture , and saw the suffering of those who torture '
@entity148 's attorney : ' the @entity0 and its defenders are using mr. @entity14 as a scapegoat for its illegal and reprehensible use of torture '
the report allegedly detailed torture like ' rectal feeding ' or ' rectal hydration ' among detainees but gave very little information about @entity39
