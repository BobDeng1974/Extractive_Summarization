@entity1 ’s @entity0 is fast and accurate - until your hand is even the slightest bit dirty or wet			1
but in the near future these scanners will not only work when your fingerprints are obscured , they will work behind layers of glass and metal			2
@entity12 maker @entity11 has unveiled its @entity14 fingerprint scanner capable of capturing everything from ridges to sweat pores using ultrasonic technology			1
the demo version ( pictured ) was covered in glass that measures 0.9mm thick , and @entity11 did not reveal what the maximum thickness is			1
phones running @entity23 are expected to launch later this year , but @entity11 did not reveal to @entity24 which devices or manufacturers it is working with a prototype version of the sensor is on display at @entity30 in @entity31			1
when a finger is placed on the tiny sensor - the demo version has a 9mm by 4mm ‘ active area ’ - the software captures an image of the fingerprint instantly			1
@entity1 ’s @entity0 ( pictured ) is fast and accurate - until your hand is even the slightest bit dirty or wet this is stored and used to authenticate a user quickly , with little margin of error			1
and because it uses waves that bounce off the surface of the finger it can be used behind materials such as glass or metal			1
the demo version was covered in glass that measures 0.9mm thick , and @entity11 did not reveal what the maximum thickness is			1
the firm did say , though , that the technology makes it more accurate and powerful than capacitive sensors , like those seen on @entity1 and @entity62 devices			1
and this is the reason why it works even if the user has dirty hands , has recently applied hand lotion and other similar scenarios			0
phones running @entity23 are expected to launch later this year , but @entity11 did not reveal to @entity24 which devices or manufacturers it is working with			2
@entity72 has developed a ‘ custom compact and high - output infrared led ’ , and a custom infrared camera			0
movements of the smooth muscle of the iris make the eye ’s openings larger or smaller , which in turn adjusts the amount of light that enters the retina these were combined with @entity72 ’s camera controller technology and biometric - authentication technology			2
it identifies a person by scanning the pattern of their iris			0
the pattern does n’t change significantly after the age of two , and it is difficult to injure its surface and difficult to forge			0
movements of the smooth muscle of the iris make the eye ’s openings larger or smaller , which in turn adjusts the amount of light that enters the retina			2
for its prototype , @entity72 has built a miniature scanner so it fits on the front of a smartphone			0
it recognises the pattern by shining an infrared led light on the sensor into the eyes and taking a picture of the pattern with the infrared camera			0
this pattern is registered and linked to the user			0
each time they look at their phone , the sensor scans their eye , matches it with the stored image and unlocks the device			0
‘ the system can reliably authenticate the detailed patterns of the iris and that can be used in most everyday situations , ’ a spokesman for @entity72 told @entity122 ‘ this can be used at a normal smartphone viewing distance , rather than within the 10cm range most existing iris recognition systems require			0
‘ and in safety testing , the infrared led light was verified to be safe for the eyes			0

@entity12 maker @entity11 unveiled its @entity136 fingerprint scanner
it is the first biometric sensor using ultrasonic technology
sensor uses ultrasonic sound waves to capture the print *'s* ridges
this also captures sweat pores and more on the *tip* of a finger
because it uses waves , can be used behind glass or even metal
this makes it more accurate and powerful than @entity1 ’s @entity0 sensor
