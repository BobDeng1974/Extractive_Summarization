last year it emerged dead @entity57 had left the @entity58 £ 54,000 to help pay off the ballooning national debt from beyond the grave			2
@entity61 : @entity62 , founder of the @entity63 , gave £ 65,000 to the @entity19 in the weeks before being made a peer in 2010 - 11 members of the public gave more than £ 1million to the government as a gift to the nation , almost all left in wills			2
and £ 54,634.36 was specifically set aside ‘ for the reduction of the national debt ’			0
amid growing doubts about why ms @entity12 ' money was taken by the political parties and not added to @entity58 coffers to spend on public services , it emerged the decision was taken by the solicitors acting as executors of her will			2
they consulted the @entity58 solicitors and the attorney general ’s office before making the decision to treat the money as a donation to the parties , both of which were ' surprised ' by the money			0
the decision of how to split the donation parties was made by the executors of the will			0

@entity118 mp , @entity31 ’s shadow justice secretary , said : ' the @entity18 have raked in over £ 1 million from private dinners with @entity22 and senior ministers in the last quarter			1
' and more than two thirds of that comes from the @entity124 – the bankers and hedge fund bosses whose taxes @entity22 cut			0
' hardworking families are seeing their living standards squeezed , with prices rising faster than wages			0
meanwhile @entity22 shows how out of touch he is , standing up for the millionaires who fund his party			0
' meanwhile , the new figures show the @entity63 gave £ 65,000 to the @entity19 , just weeks before the nightclub 's boss @entity62 received a peerage from @entity23			1
the superclub firm made a donation of £ 50,000 to the central party on june 6 , and on june 30 a further £ 15,000 was given to the @entity143 and @entity144 local association of @entity19 deputy leader @entity145			2

@entity152 : five of the biggest trade unions accounted for three - quarters of the total donations to @entity31 coffers in the three months to the end of june the revelations will heap further pressure on mr @entity152 , who has faced growing criticism for his failure to set the political agenda in recent weeks			1
a new opinion poll shows 40 per cent of people now back @entity22 and @entity170 to run the economy , compared to just 24 per cent for mr @entity152 and shadow chancellor @entity172 the @entity31 leader is caught between trying to widen the appeal of his party while relying increasingly on trade unions to bankroll his campaign for @entity178			2

in the money : @entity22 's conservatives received most in donations overall , while @entity23 's @entity19 had more in donations from non-union sources than the @entity31 , lead by @entity152 @entity42 chairman @entity210 said : ‘ despite @entity152 ’s promise of change , these independent figures prove his @entity31 is still dominated by the trade unions			1
‘ they choose the candidates , pick the leader and remain @entity31 ’s biggest donors - providing three quarters of the party 's money			1
‘ until @entity152 stops taking his union paymasters ’ cash , he will be too weak to stand up for hardworking people			0
‘ instead , he can only offer what the union barons want in return for their money - the same old @entity31 policy of more spending , more borrowing and more debt , exactly what got us into this mess in the first place			0
’ the @entity57 @entity238 was buoyed by donations more than doubling to £ 160,000			1

last month @entity32 general secretary @entity249 aid out a £ 63billion shopping list of left - wing policies he says @entity31 must adopt or lose millions in funding			2
he said the @entity31 leader had to be ‘ bold ’ and reverse the coalition ’s benefit reforms , halt spending cuts and borrowing billions to build 1million extra homes			0
@entity31 ’s reliance on union backing means it now raises less from individuals than @entity23 ’s @entity19			1
in the latest three months , the @entity19 raised £ 801,000 from non-union donations while @entity31 received only £ 730,000			1
since the 2010 general election the @entity19 have raised £ 6million from individuals compared to £ 4million for @entity31			1
and mr @entity152 has struggled to widen the supporter base , with only 305 individual @entity31 donors , compared to 1,077 for the @entity19			1
even with the union barons bankrolling the party , @entity31 still received less than the conservatives .			2
