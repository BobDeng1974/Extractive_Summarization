by @entity0 published : 08:39 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 09:49 est , 25 october 2013 a @entity5 county precinct @entity3 chair has resigned after a controversial interview that aired on ' @entity7 ' wednesday night			1
a spokesman for the @entity9 confirmed that the resignation was directly related to the interview , in which @entity12 said , among other things , ' lazy black people ' want ' the government to give them everything			1
' interviewer @entity18 interviewed @entity12 about @entity5 's new voter id law , which has been contested by the @entity21			1
@entity12 demurred , saying the law would prevent voter fraud , a crime committed , by his own admission , by possibly one or two people per year			1
' the bottom line is , the law is not racist , ' stated @entity12			2
' of course the law is not racist			0
and you 're not racist , ' suggests @entity18 , a statement which is greeted by a long pause from @entity12			2
' well , ' he says			0
' i have been called a bigot before			0
' resigned : @entity5 county precinct @entity3 chair @entity12 resigned on thursday after the offensive interview aired he goes on to tell @entity18 that in fact , one of his best friends is black			1
the segment then becomes a montage of cringe - worthy statements from @entity12 , including : ' when i was a young man , you did n't call a black a black , you called him a negro			2
' ' i had a picture one time of @entity65 sitting on a stump as a witch doctor , i posted that one @entity68 ... i was making fun of the white half of @entity65 , not the black half			0
' ' and now , you have a black person using the term , ' n * * * * * this , n * * * * * * that , ' and it 's ok for them to do it			0
' this last comment prompts @entity18 to ask @entity12 , ' you know we can hear you , right ? ' @entity12 goes on to explain that in fact , the voter id law in @entity5 would affect mostly @entity86 voters , effectively admitting that the law suppresses @entity86 votes			1
' if it hurts the whites , so be it , ' he says			0
' if it hurts a bunch of lazy blacks that want the government to give them everything , so be it			1
' @entity12 's @entity68 feed is equally unbecoming to a person in the public eye , proving he 's never been one to mince his words - or even spell them correctly			0
@entity68 faux pas : @entity12 's @entity68 feed is as uncensored as his @entity7 interview pushed out : the @entity3 says it does not support @entity12 's views or comments according to @entity106 , the @entity105 @entity3 said in a statement that @entity12 was ' recently reprimanded and removed from his position as a precinct chair			1
' he had been re-elected to the position at the 2013 convention by a margin of two votes - his own and his wife 's			0
' mr @entity12 's comments are offensive , uniformed , and unacceptable of any member within the @entity9 , ' the statement read			2
' in no way are his comments representative of the local or state @entity9			0

@entity5 @entity105 @entity3 chair @entity12 has resigned after his ' @entity7 ' interview
the interview , aired wednesday , was about the new voter id law which the @entity21 claims is intended to limit minority voters

the @entity3 *distanced* itself from @entity137 and called for his resignation
