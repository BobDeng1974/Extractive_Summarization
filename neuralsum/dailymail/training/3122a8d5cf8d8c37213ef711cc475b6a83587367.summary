here is a sampling of how presidents observed the key @entity79 anniversaries			0
@entity87 , 10th anniversary , 1954 issued a statement that reflected the @entity98 chasm of the day : ' we see peoples , once bitter enemies , burying their antagonisms and joining together to meet the problems of the postwar world			1
if all those nations which were members of the @entity107 have not maintained in time of peace the spirit of that wartime union , if some of the peoples who were our comrades - in - arms have been kept apart from us , that is cause for profound regret , but not for despair			2
' @entity87 did go to @entity3 after his presidency , for the 20th anniversary observance			1
former president @entity120 was in @entity3 in 1994 for the 50th anniversary of the invasion of @entity68 former president @entity123 , whose father is a @entity125 hero , went to @entity3 for the 60th anniversary commemoration in 2004 @entity127 , 20th anniversary , 1964 @entity127 , in @entity132 pushing for passage of the @entity134 , delivered remarks to members of a @entity79 delegation , headed by gen. @entity138 : ' your country remembers and will never forget , the resolve born on that @entity79 , that , so long as we are able , and other men are willing to stand together , we shall not permit the light of freedom to be extinguished on any continent again			1
... so let all the world know that when this nation has stood 2,000 years we shall not have forgotten the lands where our sons lie buried , nor the cause for which our sons died			0
where we have commitments to the cause of freedom , we shall honor them — today , tomorrow and always			0
' @entity155 , 30th anniversary , 1974 @entity155 , in the throes of the @entity159 investigation and with impeachment hearings underway , sent @entity138 once again to the ceremonies			2
five years earlier , @entity155 had issued a proclamation on the 25th anniversary calling the @entity3 assault ' a historical landmark in the history of freedom			1
' he also met at the @entity168 with former war correspondents who were on their way to @entity68 for the 25th anniversary observance			2
preparations and atmosphere for the @entity3 d - day landings 70th anniversary are seen in @entity175 , @entity68 91 - year - old @entity36 veteran @entity176 from @entity177 , @entity178 , who landed on june 14 , 1944 is seen here signing an autograph for two young reenactors @entity11 , 40th anniversary , 1984 @entity11 spoke at the top of the cliffs of @entity19 , the @entity182 spread behind him and with 62 gray - haired surviving @entity17 seated before him			1
' they shot rope ladders over the face of these cliffs and began to pull themselves up			0
when one ranger fell , another would take his place			0
when one rope was cut , a ranger would grab another and begin his climb again			0
they climbed , shot back , and held their footing			0
soon , one by one , the @entity17 pulled themselves over the top , and in seizing the firm land at the top of these cliffs , they began to seize back the continent of @entity203			0
two hundred and twenty - five came here			2
after two days of fighting , only 90 could still bear arms			0
' behind me is a memorial that symbolizes the @entity209 daggers that were thrust into the top of these cliffs			2
and before me are the men who put them there			0
' @entity120 , 50th anniversary , 1994 @entity120 attended the 50th anniversary , delivering his remarks at the @entity218 in @entity76 , @entity68			2
his comments offer an ironic reference point to the @entity203 that @entity1 faces as he arrives in @entity3 on friday			1
' fifty years later , what a different world we live in			0
@entity21 , @entity225 and @entity226 , liberated by our victory , now stand among our closest allies and the staunchest defenders of freedom			0
@entity230 , decimated during the war and frozen afterward in communism and cold war , has been reborn in democracy			0
' and as freedom rings from @entity238 to @entity239 , the liberation of this continent is nearly complete			0
now the question falls to our generation : how will we build upon the sacrifice of @entity79 's heroes ? like the soldiers of @entity245 , we can not stand still			0
we can not stay safe by doing so			0
avoiding today 's problems would be our own generation 's appeasements			0
for just as freedom has a price , it also has a purpose , and its name is progress			0
' @entity36 veteran @entity255 reads the names of soldiers who died landing on @entity259 at @entity260 @entity123 , 60th anniversary , 2004 @entity123 went to @entity3 in 2002 to observe @entity262			1
he returned for the 60th anniversary , speaking at the @entity36 cemetery and accompanied by @entity68 president @entity264			1
' all who are buried and named in this place are held in the loving memory of @entity36			2
we pray in the peace of this cemetery that they have reached the far shore of @entity273 's mercy			0
and we still look with pride on the men of d - day , on those who served and went on			1
it is a strange turn of history that called on young men from the prairie towns and city streets of @entity36 to cross an ocean and throw back the marching , mechanized evils of fascism			2
' @entity1 , 65th anniversary , 2009 @entity1 recalled that his grandfather , a 26 - year - old supply sergeant stationed near the @entity288 , crossed the channel six weeks after @entity79 and followed allied forces across @entity68			1
' at an hour of maximum danger , amid the bleakest of circumstances , men who thought themselves ordinary found within themselves the ability to do something extraordinary			0
... that is the story of @entity3 — but also the story of @entity36 ; of the @entity299 who gathered on a green in @entity302 ; of the @entity313 boys from @entity314 who repelled a charge at @entity316 ; of the men who gave their last full measure of devotion at @entity310 and @entity311 ; of all the young men and women whose valor and goodness still carry forward this legacy of service and sacrifice			1
