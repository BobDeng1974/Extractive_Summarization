' @entity2 was diagnosed with lymphoma in his lungs last year and had part of his left lung removed , but by april doctors saw it had spread to his lymph system and gave him just months to live			2
he underwent repeated rounds of chemotherapy and always made it to the games , even though , by the end , he could n't walk and struggled to breathe			0
