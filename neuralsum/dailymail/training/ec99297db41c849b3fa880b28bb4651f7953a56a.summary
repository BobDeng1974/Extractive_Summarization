he is also looking to win back the love of his life by offering her ' something stable ' ' i hate the idea of not being productive , i 'm prepared to do anything , i 'd love to do customer services but i can do driving jobs , admin , and jobs with anti-social hours do n't bother me			1
' i thought i would show my initiative , get up first thing in the morning in the cold and get myself out there rather than standing in the dole queue			0
' i felt a bit stupid to start with and it was bitterly cold , but i handed out at least half a dozen business cards yesterday and hopefully this will all end in a job			0
' so far i 've had a great response , loads of people honking so it 's pretty loud round there , but i 've been given some fantastic business cards by people who want my cv and like my pro-activeness			0
' @entity1 is also determined to get back on his feet in order to win back a woman he broke up with last year			1
