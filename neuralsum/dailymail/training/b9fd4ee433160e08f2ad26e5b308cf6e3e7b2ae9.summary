i ’ve played most of my best football here and am looking forward to hopefully playing even better football in the next few years			0
’ @entity0 insisted that the possibility of @entity3 missing out on @entity67 football next season did not deter him from committing the rest of his top - flight career to the club , instead pointing to the £ 37million signing of @entity73 as proof of better times ahead at @entity5			1
‘ it ’s not a massive concern for me , ’ he added			0
‘ this is because i know the direction that this club is going in , and if we do n’t make it this season then we will come back stronger and claim a @entity67 spot next season			1
‘ the future is bright for @entity3			2
this is still one of the world 's leading clubs , and we have seen this with the signing of @entity73			1
‘ people have been saying that we may have trouble attracting the world ’s best players but i think the fact @entity73 came here shows this is n’t true			1
tell - tale : @entity0 referenced the capture of @entity73 as proof that @entity3 can still sign the best players ‘ this is a new era for the club			1
we have a new management team and a great new manager in @entity1 – there has to be some time for change			2
‘ we have some great players here and despite our recent form everyone has stuck together and the team spirit is still good			0

on wednesday night he insisted that the club were always in control of the situation despite the speculation surrounding @entity0 ’s future last summer			2
‘ as far as i was concerned it was never in doubt , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ the way i looked at it , this football club was never selling @entity0			1
‘ the one thing i ’ve found about @entity3 is that they decide what players go when they want them to go			2
‘ the players wo n’t control that no matter who comes to the club			2
the club will always be in control of that			0
’ the new deal is also expected to mean that @entity0 succeeds @entity132 as captain next season , although @entity1 said that the decision will not be made until the summer			1
he revealed that he met @entity0 in secret on two occasions before starting his new job last july after the striker had been frozen out by @entity7			2
thumbs up ! the deal is thought to be for five - and - a - half years , representing a massive win for @entity1 improvement : @entity0 has scored 11 goals in all competitions this season , and has improved in all areas 1			1
sir @entity147 ( 1953 - 73 ) - 249 goals in 758 appearances 2 : @entity150 ( 1962 - 73 ) - 237 goals in 404 appearances 3 : @entity153 ( 1937 - 55 ) - 211 goals in 424 appearances 4 : @entity0 ( 2004 - present ) - 208 goals in 430 appearances 5 : @entity158 ( 1963 - 74 ) - 179 goals in 470 appearances @entity1 added : ‘ i said to @entity0 that i wanted him to stay before i ’d actually come in here			1
i ’d met @entity0 privately a couple of times to talk about his situation , to try to understand			0
‘ he came up to my house and i said to him , “ if you ask me what ’s missing i think you ’ve gone a bit soft ”			0
i thought he had n’t been the hard - working , aggressive player he was			0
i needed to try to get him back to that level			0
‘ when he came into the team i felt as though he nearly had to re-invent himself again			0
go back to being the old @entity0 , fighting for everything that ’s there but with the technical ability of a top player			0
‘ i think he ’s done that			0
he ’s back , he ’s showing leadership qualities and he ’s shown exactly what it is to play for @entity3			0
‘ i ’ve heard people saying he would n’t be here at different times but , as you know , football deals do n’t get done quickly now			0
i ’ve probably known for three or four months that this would probably happen			0
in fact , i ’ve felt it since august			0
’ break : @entity0 's wife @entity190 pictured in @entity191 on a holiday with sons @entity193 and @entity195 say cheese ! @entity190 and @entity195 smile for the camera while @entity0 finalises his £ 300k - a - week deal at @entity5 @entity1 was in charge at @entity26 when @entity0 signed his first professional contract , and admitted that there was ‘ a bit of déjà vu ’ when they posed for photographs on friday			1
despite a poor first season in charge , @entity1 believes that @entity0 ’s decision to sign a new contract is a clear sign that he trusts the @entity212 to be a success at @entity3 and attract some of the world ’s top players to @entity5			1
‘ i always felt some day our paths would cross again and they have , ’ said @entity1			0
‘ he knows by the way i train , by the way i work , by my determination to succeed that i wo n’t allow this to go the way it is			0
i 'll make changes if it does n’t improve			0
secured : @entity1 has drawn the very best out of @entity0 this season , but his future had been in doubt still ‘ i said to you as well , and you ’ll get to know when i say it i mean it , that we ’d be in for all the best players in the world – and that has n’t changed			1
‘ all the top players want to play for @entity3			2
i ca n’t tell you the amount of phone calls i ’ve had from top players around the world who want to play for @entity3			2
’ now @entity1 believes that @entity0 can go on to achieve legendary status at @entity5 and elevate himself alongside @entity3 greats like @entity158 and sir @entity147			1
‘ to be a legend at @entity3 it is something where you are associated with this club for the rest of your life , ’ he said			2
‘ for @entity0 , i think he ’s recognised people like @entity147 @entity158 and the way those big stars are seen here			0
bobbing ! @entity1 took training in a club bobble hat while @entity258 grinned from ear to ear main man : the @entity20 striker has been a standout for the @entity263 this season in trying circumstances ‘ @entity0 ’s next thing is that we have to keep challenging him to get those goals and make those big targets			1
’ in order to make sure that he gets the most out of the remaining years of his career , it has been agreed that @entity3 ’s commercial department will take over the handling of his endorsement contracts from now on			0
for example , @entity0 ’s deals with companies like @entity278 and @entity279 will now become the responsibility of the club , meaning that the @entity20 striker will now have one of the biggest football clubs on the planet effectively working on his behalf to maximise his earnings			1
it had looked as if the 28 - year - old would be leaving for pastures new last summer , with @entity11 keen to land the @entity20 man .			1

@entity3 *announce* @entity0 's new contract
the striker has penned a new four - year extension at @entity5 , keeping him at the club until june 2019 worth £ 300,000 - a - week
the 28 - year - old 's signing represents a huge victory for boss @entity1
@entity20 man ' to become a club ambassador ' for @entity3 when he retires
@entity0 : ' the fact @entity73 came shows we have no trouble attracting players '
possibility of no @entity67 football ' not a concern ' for a @entity0
@entity1 : ' this football club was never selling @entity0 . never . '
