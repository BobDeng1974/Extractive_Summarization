police ignored the sexual abuse of hundreds of young girls because they were too busy chasing @entity4 crime targets that would earn bonuses for senior staff			1
whistleblower @entity7 , a former detective who tried to investigate the abuse , said money was diverted away from protecting the children from rape , trafficking and beatings in order to pursue so - called ‘ priority crimes ’			1
the offences , which included car crime , were considered crucial for satisfying a target culture introduced by the last @entity4 government			1
now it has emerged the same targets were also linked to performance - related pay for top officers at @entity25			1
the targets have been scrapped by the @entity44 amid concern they were harming policing			0
@entity49 parliamentary candidate @entity48 , a former member of the home affairs select committee , said : ‘ @entity4 ’s grossly irresponsible obsession with targets led to a perverted sense of priorities whereby senior officers could get bonuses for prioritising car crime while hundreds of young girls were being abused with impunity			1
’ the first details of the scandal emerged earlier this year when papers from @entity25 , relating to child abuse in @entity39 , were leaked to the @entity64			2
the documents and the testimony of former officers suggested the force failed to pursue a number of child sexual exploitation inquiries and ignored intelligence that girls as young as 12 were being raped			1
a copy of a document from the force ’s intelligence database detailed more than 200 girls suspected of being sexually exploited			0
it listed more than 320 men accused of carrying out abuse , mainly between 2007 and 2010			0
allegations included rapes , traffickings , child abduction and threats to scald girls by holding kettles of boiling water over them			0
the alleged victims were aged between 12 and 15 while their abusers included @entity92 , white @entity93 , black @entity93 , and men of @entity96 heritage			0
the dossier by professor @entity98 ( pictured ) into the @entity40 scandal described how @entity25 were ‘ more focused on dealing with offences such as burglary and vehicle crime ’ than child abuse in most cases , the files suggest there is no evidence police took any action			1
in 2007 , after an investigation led to two @entity92 @entity112 being convicted of abuse , officers asked for resources to mount a much wider investigation in @entity39			2
mr @entity7 said he asked for £ 24,000 and was given £ 16,000			0
but after spending only half that amount he was told the entire budget had gone			0
he says the other £ 8,000 was diverted to spend chasing ‘ district priorities , to investigate robbery , burglary and car crime ’			1
these priorities were tied to @entity124 targets introduced by @entity4 in 2002			2
in @entity40 , the dossier into the scandal there by professor @entity98 described how senior and middle managers at @entity25 were ‘ more focused on dealing with offences such as burglary and vehicle crime ’ than tackling child abuse			2
at least 1,400 girls in the town were left to be abused by @entity135 men between 1997 and 2013 because the authorities were also too scared to admit there was a race issue , according to her report published in september			0
a second report by government adviser @entity142 concluded the establishment in @entity40 ignored child sexual exploitation due to ‘ misplaced political correctness ’			0
and @entity146 found senior @entity148 officers prioritised burglary and car crime over victims of abuse			1
@entity4 ’s crime targets meant forces were aware that chief constables could get the sack if performance was repeatedly inadequate			1
the link to performance - related pay that has emerged meant senior officers could pocket bonuses worth thousands for catching criminals or reducing the incidence of so - called priority offences			2
this system has also been scrapped by the @entity44			0
@entity25 said : ‘ chief officer bonuses were ratified as part of a process overseen by police authorities			0

police were too busy chasing @entity4 crime targets to protect young girls
