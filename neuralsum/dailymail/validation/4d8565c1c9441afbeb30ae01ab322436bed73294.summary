@entity1 defender @entity0 is in line to make his @entity4 debut this month , having been included in a 27 - man squad for matches against @entity7 and @entity8			1
manager @entity9 has convened a familiar group for the friendly at @entity12 on march 25 and the @entity14 qualifier that follows at @entity15 on march 29 , with the 19 - year - old set for his first senior appearance			1
he was an unused substitute against @entity18 in november but with @entity9 set to rotate his squad in the first fixture , @entity0 can expect to add another landmark moment to his breakthrough season			2
@entity36 's @entity35 is also included alongside veteran defenders @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 , meaning @entity42 's @entity41 again misses out			0
@entity44 winger @entity43 is another who may benefit from a run - out in @entity47 having returned to the squad			0
@entity27 was handed a six - game ban after being found guilty of spitting at @entity50 's @entity34 @entity44 winger @entity43 ( centre ) is bidding to win his first @entity4 cap since 2011 @entity53 won his first and only cap against @entity55 in 2011 's @entity56 and withdrew from his previous call - up due to injury			1
@entity59 , on loan at @entity61 from @entity50 , is the only natural left - back but is expected to withdraw with a knee injury			0
that could yet open the door for the absent @entity66 , who has been starved of first - team football at @entity68 but has recently joined @entity69 on loan			1
@entity71 , who has three goals in four @entity14 qualifiers so far , leads the forward unit and will travel from @entity76 outfit @entity75			0
but there was no place for @entity79 , on loan with @entity83 franchise @entity81			0
