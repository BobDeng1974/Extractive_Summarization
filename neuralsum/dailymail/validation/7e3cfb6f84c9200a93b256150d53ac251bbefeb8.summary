while @entity1 was scoring on his debut for @entity3 , @entity0 was scoring on his first start for @entity5 to give the reigning @entity7 champions a 1 - 0 win over @entity9			1
the former @entity11 striker , who nearly joined @entity1 at @entity12 as part as the deal that took @entity15 to @entity5 , settled the match in the first half in what was a largely unconvincing performance from @entity20 ’s team			1
@entity21 wanted @entity0 to move to @entity22 but he ended up staying in @entity11 before moving to @entity23 last summer			0
his goals have helped them into the last eight of the @entity27 and he took that form with him into this @entity30 qualifier			0
@entity0 opened the scoring for @entity5 as his looped effort evades the gloves of @entity34 @entity0 beats @entity9 defender @entity35 to loft the ball into the back of the net @entity5 : @entity39 ; @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 ( @entity44 79 ) ; @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 ( @entity48 74 ) ; @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity0 ( @entity51 65 ) subs not used : @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 scorer ( s ) : @entity0 28 booked : @entity42 manager : @entity20 @entity9 : @entity34 ; @entity64 , @entity35 , @entity65 , @entity66 ; @entity67 , @entity68 ( @entity69 76 ) ; @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 ; @entity73 ( @entity74 32 , @entity75 91 ) subs not used : @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 booked : @entity64 , @entity74 , @entity65 manager : @entity87 referee : @entity89 playing instead of the injured @entity90 he converted a @entity46 pass on 28 minutes but @entity5 failed to find the second and still look a long way from the form they showed when they won the @entity95 three years ago			1
they also lost @entity97 to a groin injury in the second half			0
@entity5 applied all the early pressure but @entity50 and @entity0 sent their first shots wide and @entity49 missed the target with a diving header 12 yards out from an @entity50 cross			1
@entity9 looked dangerous on the coutner attack in the first 20 minutes and @entity106 sent a wayward volley wide of @entity39 ’ goal from a corner			1
from the edge of the area @entity110 also went close , but again @entity5 ’s goalkeeper was able to watch the ball go wide			0
@entity5 attacked with more quality than the visitors and just before the half hour they were in front when @entity47 found @entity46 and his first time ball sent @entity0 through			1
he held off the last defender and when @entity9 keeper @entity121 went to ground early he lofted the ball over him to score			0
@entity5 then enjoyed their best spell			0
@entity49 tested @entity34 with another shot and @entity47 began to lead @entity9 a merry dance in midfield			2
on the day that @entity129 showed up in @entity130 to sign a three - year contract @entity5 could easily have been reminded of how much they miss him			0
@entity34 looks back in despair as @entity5 take the lead at the @entity136 @entity0 celebrates his first international goal on his third cap for @entity20 's side but his @entity141 team - mate was running the midfield until the break			1
they could have gone in at half time 2 - 0 up but @entity42 ' header from @entity49 ’s free - kick came back off the frame of the goal			0
encouraged by @entity5 ’s narrow lead @entity9 had their chances at the start of the second half with @entity39 saving @entity110 ’s free - kick			1
the keeper then gave @entity156 ’s @entity71 another chance kicking the ball straight to him but then parried his shot			0
the @entity23 striker is congratulated by his team - mates as @entity5 made their first - half dominance pay @entity141 midfielder @entity47 controls the ball as @entity106 closes in to make a challenge that was typical of the sloppiness that had crept into @entity5 ’s play at the start of the second period			2
they needed the second goal – it might have come when @entity47 fed @entity0 but his shot was closer to the corner flag than @entity34 ’s goal and that was the last thing he did before being replaced by @entity51			2
at least he had his debut goal			0
it was still far too easy to reach the edge of @entity5 ’s penalty area and they were saved by @entity9 not being able to make the most of arriving there – @entity110 again shot straight at @entity39 after meeting @entity182 ’s cross			1
@entity183 midfielder @entity49 is halted in his tracks by two @entity9 defenders @entity11 playmaker @entity50 evades the outstretched leg of @entity9 forward @entity68 @entity5 continued to over-elaborate at one end and leave too much space at the other and when @entity97 went off holding his groin with 12 minutes left even @entity141 supporters were worried			1
they played out the final minutes to take the three points and they stay second behind @entity194 but @entity20 will not need telling there is work to be done if they are to retain their crown in @entity199 next summer			2
@entity39 kept his place in the @entity5 goal despite the imperious form of @entity204 this season the two sides line up prior to kick off at the @entity136 to observe the national anthems			2

@entity0 scored his first international goal to give hosts the lead
@entity5 had to survive heavy pressure from @entity9 in the second half
@entity5 remain three points behind @entity30 leaders @entity194 , who also won
