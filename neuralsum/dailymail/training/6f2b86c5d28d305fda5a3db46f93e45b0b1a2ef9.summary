by @entity0 published : 14:14 est , 24 september 2012 updated : 11:36 est , 25 september 2012 emotions were running high at the @entity4 / @entity3 game on sunday night and a fan chant of ' bullsh * t , ' aired live on @entity7 during primetime , had some saying the network had violated @entity11 standards			1
the expletive eruption from @entity4 fans , enraged by non other than the league 's replacement refs , was just one in a series of incidents at the @entity20 match at the @entity21 in @entity4 - including a random fan in a cape rushing the field and both coaches being punished for belligerence toward the infamous replacement refs			1
@entity4 enthusiasts cried out ' bullsh * t ' in the game 's fourth quarter , when @entity4 coach @entity31 received a penalty for ' unsportsmanlike behavior ' when he knocked into a ref as he tried to call a time - out			1
not happy : @entity4 coach @entity31 ( left ) gets into it with a referee and @entity3 coach @entity40 similarly ripped into the league 's replacement refs , who have been the object of ridicule this season the clearly comprehended curse word was repeated by the audience for several moments and though the @entity11 initially said they were looking into whether @entity7 was negligent in airing the taunts during their coverage on @entity49 , the agency now says there wo n't be a fine			1

the @entity11 , headed by @entity63 , typically wo n't punish a network for a ' fleeting expletive ' but since the shouts on sunday were easily heard and lasted for several minutes , some thought the @entity7 could face a fine			1
but a @entity11 representative told @entity69 , ' there ’s never been any penalties imposed for obscenities inadvertently heard over air			2
' and a @entity4 rep was equally nonplussed by the incident			2
' we ’re certainly aware of it			0
normally , our crowd is one of the most enthusiastic and respectful home audiences in all of sports , ' senior vice president of public and community relations for the franchise , @entity83 , said			0
random : a fan rushed the field on sunday at the @entity21 in @entity4 donning a cape with the head of comedian and talk - show host @entity90			1
he said the stunt was to support anti-bullying causes if at first you do n't succeed : the cape wearing fan had tried his field rushing stunt at an @entity99 game in april after the game , the coach claimed he accidentally bumped into the ref when he was trying to get the man 's attention to call a time - out			1
' i guess i did n't understand how he interpreted it , but what we 're told is to get the timeout where they can see it in front of their face in those situations , ' @entity31 , 50 , told reporters after the game			1
' that 's what i 've been told for five years going into this game			2
i think he took it as bumping him			0
i did n't mean to bump him			0
i wanted to call a timeout , so i apologize for bumping , but the intent was to call a timeout			0

rookie : @entity4 kicker @entity146 kicks the game - winning field goal in the final moments of the @entity4 / @entity3 game in @entity4 on sunday victory : @entity4 kicker @entity146 , left , celebrates his game - winning field goal with teammate @entity154 after the @entity4 win sunday 's game seemed like a comedy of errors - starting with a streaking fan whose mission who strutted his stuff but all in the name of charity , he claims			1
the intruder , @entity164 , stormed the field donning a cape emblazoned with the face of @entity90 , a baseball cap and briefs , in footage uploaded to @entity171 , in order to raise awareness of the dangers of bullying			2
@entity164 has pulled this stunt before , at an @entity99 game in april , and he even has a website to raise awareness for his anti-bullying efforts			0
after the streaking side - show and the call against @entity31 ignited the crowd , a last minute move by the @entity4 further set off a coach , this time for the opposing team			1
the @entity4 ended up winning the game by 31 - 30 but only after @entity4 rookie @entity146 kicked a 27 - yard field goal that barely landed within bounds			1
refs ruled @entity146 's goal was in but the @entity3 were n't having in			1
@entity3 coach @entity40 openly questioned the ruling and grabbed a ref by the arm , angrily opposing what he called an arbitrary ruling , as the official walked off the field			2
bittersweet : @entity4 wide receiver @entity200 reacts after kicker @entity146 kicked the winning field goal on sunday			1

talk to the league about the way they called it			0
