by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 knew the question was coming , and when it did he saw no reason to go all coy and cagey			1
why would he ? this was another saturday , another positive performance and another important point picked up by the @entity10 ‘ caretaker ’			1
so when pressed on whether he was enjoying all this and whether he might just be tempted to make a permanent living out of one of the toughest jobs in @entity16 football , @entity2 sent a clear message to owner @entity18			1
@entity10 caretaker @entity2 is hopeful of being handed the manager 's job full - time @entity21 scored @entity10 's goal against @entity23 at @entity24 's on saturday ‘ he knows i ’m capable , ’ he said , eyes lighting up			1
‘ i enjoyed the second half today			0
’ then after a pause he added : ‘ i enjoyed the first half as well			0
because you ’re in charge of something that ’s really good			2
’ @entity2 , 49 , has sat in this hotseat twice before ; when @entity33 was sacked in february 2012 and when @entity34 departed in april 2013			1
so he was the obvious person to turn to when @entity35 lost patience with @entity37 — after just six competitive matches — at the end of august			2
@entity2 , who came to @entity40 as academy team boss in january 2009 , has been a rock of permanence amid the choppy waters of the frequent managerial and ownership changes at @entity40 over the last five years			1
so when @entity37 went , he delegated his work with the kids to others and , like a trusty substitute teacher , stepped in to the interim job once again			0
only this time it feels different			0
when @entity10 beat @entity54 before the international break , @entity18 praised the ‘ beautiful football ’ he had witnessed and added : ‘ i ’ve decided to leave the team to @entity2			1
’ it has been a difficult few months for @entity10 , and @entity21 's goal gained them a much - needed point @entity21 lines up the shot that saw @entity10 draw level at @entity63 on saturday the @entity64 , wearing designer shades as he watched his team from the stands , celebrated madly as @entity21 earned @entity10 a merited point and extended @entity23 ’s poor start to the season			1
and there ’s no doubt who @entity18 would have phoned on saturday night			0
‘ he speaks to me about what we did in training , the team and how it ’s evolving , ’ @entity2 said			2
‘ he ’s a real football nut and we can be on the phone for an hour , hour - and - a - half talking football			0
’ it sounds like it ’s meant to be			0
@entity2 seems to have the trust and the ear of a man who crashed his way through 36 managers in 22 years at @entity87			2
but the job security is n’t quite there yet			0
when questioned if he would be in charge of @entity10 for tomorrow ’s trip to @entity92 , he said sharply : ‘ yes , unless you know anything different			1
’ @entity10 looked much improved at @entity23			1
they did start sluggishly and trailed when @entity95 fired home seven minutes before half - time , but roared back after @entity2 had delivered his half - time team talk			1
@entity23 's @entity98 ( centre ) shoots at the @entity10 goal while @entity2 waits for @entity35 ’s number to flash up , @entity23 boss @entity101 said he would be placing a call to @entity104 , the man who appoints referees to @entity107 matches			1
@entity101 was furious after @entity108 waved away appeals for a stoppage - time penalty when the lively @entity111 fell under a clumsy challenge from @entity113			2
‘ i ring him more than my wife			0
i think she is getting a bit jealous to be honest with you , ’ he said , only half - joking			0
‘ i do n’t want my young , exciting player , who beats people for fun , with ease , to lose confidence and stop doing it because he ’s worried about getting a yellow card			0
’ @entity101 could have done with the spot - kick			0
@entity23 have won just once at home in their last 22 league matches going back to october			2
a travelling contingent of 2,654 boosted the crowd to a still - paltry 15,266 — empty blue seats very nearly outnumbering the fans			0
but just one seat would suit @entity2 right now — the manager ’s .			2

@entity2 has been in charge at @entity10 since the end of august
it is his third time in temporary charge at @entity40
@entity2 is eyeing the job on a permanent basis , and says he is capable
