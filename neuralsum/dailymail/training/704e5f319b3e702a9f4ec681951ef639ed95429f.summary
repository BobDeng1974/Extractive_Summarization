by @entity0 last updated at 2:10 pm on 31st october 2011 hand - in - hand and smiling as they leave church , this is @entity5 marrying the woman who claims she was ‘ airbrushed ’ from his life			1
the marriage – @entity5 ’s first – would end in divorce within a year , but yesterday ex-wife @entity10 told how they went on to enjoy a ten - year affair after the motoring journalist married second wife @entity15			1
at one point the @entity17 philanderer even told her he had cheated on both of them with a @entity22 colleague			1
big day : @entity5 with his first wife @entity24 wed in 1989			1
their marriage lasted less than a year , but they embarked on a ten - year affair in 1999 mrs @entity29 revealed how she and @entity5 would enjoy take - away curries followed by sex sessions at his @entity33 bolthole			1
details of the alleged affair emerged after @entity5 , 51 , lifted a gagging order which prevented mrs hall from disclosing intimate details of their relationship			2
despite branding him a ‘ bully and a hypocrite ’ over the decision to take out the injunction , businesswoman @entity29 likened @entity5 to a pair of ‘ comfy slippers ’ whom she never got over after their split in 1990 – two years after he joined @entity22 ’s @entity17			1
she claimed the pair rekindled their relationship in 1999 after she sent him a note saying ‘ call me ’ with her phone number			2
after a lunch in a @entity58 restaurant , they spent that evening at @entity5 ’s @entity59 flat – where he kept a sofa bed they had bought together years before			2
the presenter often stays in the capital for work purposes during the week , travelling home to his wife in @entity67 at weekends			1
second wife : the presenter with @entity15 on the red carpet last month mrs @entity29 said : ‘ we watched tv and had an @entity74 take - away			1
we started on the sofa then ended up in bed together			2
it was so natural and normal			2
it was just like the old times , like we ’d never been apart			2
’ she said the decade of deceit began a few months later when @entity5 once more got in touch			2
again they would enjoy a take - away – @entity5 ’s favourite was chicken madras , she said – before spending the night together at either ’s flat			0
many of the liaisons took place after @entity5 had been filming at the @entity17 track at @entity92 in @entity93			1
@entity5 even admitted to her that he was ' frolicking with a colleague ' , the the @entity94 reported yesterday			1
he had to explain himself to his first and second wife after he was pictured embracing @entity22 presenter @entity97 at the height of his affair in 2003			1
mrs @entity29 told @entity103 : ' i said to him in a text or phone call : " oh dear , you 're gon na get into trouble , i told you i was the only person you could sleep with who was n't your wife "			0
' although the star rarely took her out during the alleged secret romance , mrs hall , 46 , said they once stayed at the four - star @entity113 hotel while @entity5 was filming @entity17 in southern @entity115 in 2007			1
i want you back : @entity24 says she expects @entity5 to be in touch and that the pair will ' carry on ' she said she still loved @entity5 and wanted him back			0
‘ i do n’t feel we committed adultery during the affair because he was my husband , ’ she said			0
‘ he was like a pair of comfy slippers			0
‘ i know he ’ll call again in about six months , i will see him and it will carry on			0
’ the mother - of - two , from @entity93 , claimed she had ‘ honoured and loved ’ @entity5 for 28 years since they got together when she was just 17 and he was 22			0
the pair married in 1989 at @entity127 in @entity128 , @entity129 , and honeymooned in @entity130			0
but within six months , @entity5 wrote in his newspaper column on saturday , she ‘ admitted to a number of flings ’ and left him for another man – friend @entity134 , now a 54 - year - old property developer			0
they went on to marry in february 1993 – two months before @entity5 wed @entity15 , 50 – but divorced in 1996 after having two children			0
mrs @entity29 said she could n’t hide her feelings for @entity5 from her second husband and described leaving the heavy smoking presenter a ‘ huge mistake ’			1
she said that on september 22 , 2009 , which would have been their 20th wedding anniversary , @entity5 sent a text to @entity24 which simply read : ‘ do you know what day it is ? ’ ‘ that is not somebody who has forgotten and moved on , ’ said mrs @entity29 , who by then had met somebody else and said she had stopped returning @entity5 ’s calls and texts			0
@entity5 told last week how he lifted the injunction , imposed last year , because it was ‘ pointless ’ to continue when speculation over his identity was rife in the ‘ legal - free world ’ of the internet			0
mrs @entity29 ’s allegations come five months after it was claimed @entity5 cheated on his wife with @entity17 live tour colleague @entity159 , 42			1
@entity5 claimed in his newspaper column @entity29 had contacted him 15 years ago , after his tv career had started to take off , demanding ‘ money for her silence ’			0
he added : ‘ eventually , these demands became so hysterical and so huge , my wife and i were forced to take out an injunction			0
but thanks to @entity171 and the internet , it did n’t work			0
’ mrs @entity29 denies attempting to blackmail the star			0
@entity15 yesterday denied claims she had kicked the presenter out of their country home near @entity179 after allegations of the affair left her ‘ at the end of her tether ’ .			1
