by @entity0 last updated at 11:08 am on 28th september 2011 slow zone : conservative meps rubbished the suggestion that all @entity5 states should agree to the 20mph limit in residential areas @entity5 plans to enforce a mandatory 20mph speed limit in residential zones and replace the @entity10 with @entity12 law has sparked outrage from @entity15 politicians			0
conservative members of the @entity17 last night slammed the suggestion to decrease the limit as ' silly '			0
dozens of road safety suggestions were endorsed thanks to a show of hands by @entity2			1
they voted on a report drawn up by centre - right mep @entity25 , whose resolution on behalf of the @entity17 's @entity27 includes the introduction of a 30km speed limit in residential areas			0
this would include single lane roads in urban areas which have no separate cycle lane , ' with a view to protecting vulnerable road users more effectively '			1
the proposed limit equates to 18.6mph and is just one of a raft of recommendations which also include harmonised road traffic rules , road signs , road worthiness tests and blood alcohol limits			2
ironically , mr @entity25 is from @entity45 , the @entity12 country which decades ago warned it would never tolerate interference in its right to have motorways with no speed limits			1
and although today 's proposal is only an ' own initiative ' report and unlikely to see the light of legislative day , @entity50 for the @entity51 and transport spokesman @entity52 said it was ' another example of @entity12 trying to dictate to @entity15 on issues that should be decided locally '			1
@entity59 mep @entity52 ( left ) attacked the proposals as ' plain silly '			2
@entity45 mep @entity25 ( right ) , who put forward the report , believes that his recommendations will halve road deaths by 2020 she said : ' of course speed limits as low as 20mph or so can be right in some very specific areas , especially near schools or nurseries , but every location is different and these decisions need to be made case by case			1
' not by a @entity12 - wide edict			0
' a @entity15 road sign declaring ' speed limit - 18.64mph ' would be ' plain silly ' she said			2
other ideas among more than 100 from mr @entity25 include standardised road signs across the @entity5 , harmonised road worthiness standards for cars , a common drink - driving limit and a standard ' highway code ' for all member states			0
mr @entity25 , whose report is a response to a @entity87 discussion paper last year on road safety , says his combined measures could halve road accident deaths by 2020 - and help towards his ultimate target of a ' zero death toll ' on @entity12 's roads			1
' the choice of measures and their assessment should be a scientific process , based on comparable , high - quality data , definitions and statistics , ' said mr @entity25 during the debate on his report			0
' we expect a harmonised analysis of the causes of accidents and injuries and an @entity5 - wide exchange of data which respects a high standard of data privacy			0

@entity45 @entity50 says his proposals will halve road accident deaths by 2020
