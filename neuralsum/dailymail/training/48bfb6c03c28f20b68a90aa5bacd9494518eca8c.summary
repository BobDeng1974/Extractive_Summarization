by @entity0 fears : @entity3 director @entity2 antibiotics will soon become so ineffective that a sore throat or grazing your knee could kill , the @entity3 has warned			1
the microbes that cause the most common infections are starting to resist the drugs , meaning conditions will become much harder to treat			1
this will make remedies more expensive , and some conditions could even become untreatable			1
@entity3 director general @entity2 said that the world was fast approaching the ‘ post-antibiotic era ’			1
she said the chances of changing this were ‘ dim ’ and expressed concerns that the production line of more resistant drugs was ‘ virtually dry ’			1
‘ a post-antibiotic era means , in effect , an end to modern medicine as we know it , ’ she said			1
‘ things as common as strep throat or a child ’s scratched knee could once again kill			1
‘ some sophisticated interventions , like hip replacements , organ transplants , cancer chemotherapy and care of pre-term infants , would become far more difficult or even too dangerous to undertake			2
’ dr @entity37 added : ‘ @entity39 resistance is on the rise in @entity41 , and elsewhere in the world			2
replacement treatments are more costly , more toxic , need much longer durations of treatment and may require treatment in intensive care units			2
’ at the launch of a @entity3 book on the subject in @entity51 , dr @entity37 told a group of infectious disease experts that the ineffective nature of many antibiotics was because of ‘ misuse ’			1
she said overuse of antibiotics had contributed to the resistance of diseases and set out a number of ways to ease the situation			2
the @entity3 boss told the meeting more care should be taken to ensure that prescriptions are only given out when absolutely necessary			1
and she added that antibiotics should not be used in food production			2
developing countries are particularly susceptible to infections which are becoming resistant to antibiotics			0
dr @entity37 said that the worsening situation is at risk of being ignored			0
she said : ‘ one problem is that the threat of antimicrobial resistance is competing for attention in a world beset by one global crisis after another			0
these days , doomsday scenarios are a dime a dozen			0
’ overused : as well as being prescribed to treat illnesses , antibiotics are commonly used in food production according to the @entity3 – the public health arm of the @entity91 – several countries have already introduced measures to quell the overuse of antibiotics			1
the organisation is calling for such policies to be implemented globally			0
it said that the treatment of tuberculosis globally had already identified the limitations of certain antibiotics			0
of the 12million cases recorded in 2010 , about 650,000 involved strands that were resistant to multiple drugs			0
the health body said that even with the highest standards of care and medication , only 50 per cent of sufferers survived			0
the @entity111 says it already ‘ has its eyes wide open ’ to the issue and has compiled a five - year action plan with 12 areas for improvement			0
medical experts in developing countries such as @entity119 and @entity120 have also introduced schemes to reduce the number of antibiotics being prescribed .			0
