some councils have shaved the rates that they pay companies to care for the elderly and frail , @entity16 of the @entity17 revealed			2
mr @entity18 told the @entity19 that the scaling back of funding was so quick that firms have managed to avoid paying the £ 6.31 - an - hour minimum pay rate			2
he claimed that the commission has been told that @entity24 ( @entity24 ) has identified 120 care providers for investigation			1
to cut costs , care companies are allegedly using tactics such as not paying for travel time between care visits , so that they do n't have to pay the minimum wage			1
@entity33 estimates that a homecare company needs to be paid a minimum of £ 14.95 an hour by a council to fulfill wage law and training responsibilities			0
but it believes that one in five councils were now paying £ 11 or less , the lowest being £ 8.98 an hour			0
the association said that 90 per cent of councils had slashed its members payments in the past year , leaving them struggling to comply with the minimum wage law - the alternative being they stop trading or go out of business			1
@entity49 , the care minister , told the newspaper that he had asked the @entity51 to see whether staff who work more hours than they should for less than the minimum wage could guarantee that they received care to a high standard			1
the minister accepted that there are far too many employers paying people less than the minimum wage by not taking account of travel time , which was unacceptable			1
it comes after a poll in september revealed that more than a quarter of care home residents are treated no better than children at meal times			1
@entity18 said that the scaling back of funding was so quick that the firms have managed to avoid paying the £ 6.31 - an - hour minimum pay rate and nearly as many families say their relative does not get enough help with eating and drinking			2
the @entity80 poll , of 1,588 people , found that 28 per cent of those with a relative or a friend in care said that they had sometimes been treated like children at meal times			0
research chief @entity87 said : ‘ with so many residents needing help with their meals , staff in homes need to make sure they are treated in a professional and sympathetic manner			0
’ the findings come seven years after @entity96 ’s government launched guidelines for care home and hospital staff demanding patients and residents be treated with dignity			1
it also follows the @entity105 ’s dignity for the @entity107 campaign which has highlighted the mistreatment of care home residents			2
more than half of the families questioned said their loved ones needed help to eat and nearly half said relatives needed help to drink			0
but 15 per cent of families with relatives currently in care said they were not getting enough help to eat			0
of those with relatives in care over the past five years the figure was 26 per cent			0
the numbers were similar in respect to liquids			0
despite this , 53 per cent said care home food was better than that at @entity131 hospitals			2
the findings come after it was revealed four out of five councils have restricted home help to those who are ' critically ' in need of it .			0

@entity24 has identified 120 care home providers for investigation
care companies are allegedly using tactics such as not paying for travel time between care visits , so that they do n't have to pay the minimum wage
