the retired civil servant set a trap for his bushy - tailed foe and lay in wait			0
it did n’t take long for the grey squirrel to take the bait and , with the animal cornered in the make - shift cage , the 75 - year - old from @entity23 , @entity3 , shot it twice with his air rifle			2
he went shopping but , when he returned two hours later , the animal was still alive so he shot it a further three times			1
yesterday it emerged @entity1 is facing up to six months in jail or a £ 5,000 fine after being hauled before the courts for causing unnecessary suffering to the squirrel			1
the keen crown green bowler and bird lover was reported to the @entity33 by a neighbour who spotted the animal , maimed , but still alive in his garden			1
the five shots failed to kill the animal and it was later put down			2
@entity1 pleaded guilty but told the hearing he had been ‘ provoked ’ by the activities of the squirrels , which he described as ‘ garden rats ’ and ‘ vermin ’			1
speaking afterwards , he said : ‘ i can not believe i have been taken to court over this one grey squirrel , which , frankly , has been a pest and vermin			2
it does seem over the top			0
‘ i just wanted to keep my garden nice and feed the birds , yet these squirrels kept coming in and taking all the food			2
‘ they seem to wait in the trees until i ’m not in the garden before striking			2
they dig up my garden and they eat the bird feed			2
in my mind they are a real problem			0
‘ i do n’t want people to think i do n’t like animals – far from it			0
i used to work on a farm years ago and i have a budgie called @entity65 who is marvellous , so clever			0
’ wounded : x-rays of the dead squirrel showing pellet wounds after @entity70 repeatedly shot it he fired on the animal after it stole bird food from his garden in @entity23 , @entity3 @entity77 , prosecuting , told @entity78 that the @entity33 was alerted on september 27 last year by a neighbour who had spotted the injured squirrel in the garden of @entity1 ’s home , in @entity2			1
she said : ‘ the squirrel had been trapped in a cage in the defendant ’s garden			1
@entity1 took his .22 air rifle and shot at it two times			1
when interviewed by the @entity90 referred to squirrels as ' vermin ' and ' garden rats ' ' the defendant went shopping at approximately 11am and left the squirrel in the trap			1
' later when he returned , it was still grabbing at the cage and biting it			2
' so the defendant shot the squirrel a further three times at around 2:30pm			1
he left the squirrel in the trap and went out			0
’ @entity1 , who left to visit his sick wife in a care home , said he assumed the animal was dead , but when the @entity33 arrived at 4.20pm it was still alive			1

‘ this defendant shot a squirrel five times over five hours			1
he said he did n’t care about the suffering of the animal			0
the method of dispatch should be carried out humanely			0

he found it comical that the @entity33 were even investigating			0
’ @entity120 , the vet who eventually put down the animal , confirmed it had multiple pellet wounds and was alive but unresponsive			1
when questioned by @entity33 officers @entity1 was described as ‘ obtrusive ’			1
