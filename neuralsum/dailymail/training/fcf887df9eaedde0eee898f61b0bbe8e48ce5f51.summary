by @entity0 published : 08:58 est , 23 february 2014 @entity2 : 11:57 est , 23 february 2014 nearly a month 's rain could fall in parts of @entity5 by tomorrow as experts warn this winter 's storm weather is shrinking the @entity5 's coastline 10 times faster than normal			1
forecasters say the wet and windy conditions will continue in the north - west tonight with gusts of wind reaching 70mph in parts of the @entity5			1
@entity17 forecaster @entity16 said : ' there will be an awful lot of rain but the places that will see the most will be on the tops of hills in @entity24 and in largely unpopulated areas			1
a section of staircase leading to the beach at @entity29 in @entity30 is removed after being damaged by a storm which caused three years of erosion in one month heavy seas lead to flooding and storm damage on @entity36 in @entity37 ' the average rainfall for @entity24 in february is usually around 100 to 105mm and we forecasting that by tomorrow morning 80mm may have fallen in these areas			2
' however in most places it 's likely to be more like 20 to 30mm			2
in the south there will be not an awful lot of rainful , it will be mostly dry and mild			0
' going forward into the week the weather will continue to be unsettled , it will be blustery , windy and a mixture of sun and showers for most of the @entity5 , but temperatures will remain mild			1
' ' @entity54 , such as @entity55 , may also see heavy rain like this and coastal areas will continue to see high winds of 60 to 70mph			1
three severe @entity17 rain warnings remain in place and the environment is continuing to warn about flooding in 48 areas			2
meanwhile , experts have said @entity5 's coastline will shrink 10 times faster this year following the storms - eroding by metres rather than centimetres			1
hundreds of miles of @entity68 and @entity70 coast are expected to recede by up to a staggering three metres this year , putting the homes and livelihoods of thousands under threat			2
a couple had to leave their holiday home in @entity30 due to the storms			2
recent storms brought the cliff edge too close , one metre large waves smash against the harbour wall at @entity82 , @entity83 storm damage : @entity86 erosion and landslide at @entity88 in @entity89 research by @entity91 has found the expected rate of erosion of 20cm to 30cm per year is likely to jump to between two metres to three metres after huge waves have battered coastal towns this winter			1
as cliffs have crumbled under the weight of relentless rainfall , the depth of sand on beaches has risen dramatically and is two metres higher than usual in places , according to a study			0
a team from the university has used state - of - the - art equipment , including seisometers and thermal cameras , to record changes to @entity37 's coastline over the past three years in what is thought to be one of the most far reaching studies ever undertaken			1
the latest results worryingly reveal the level of erosion is up to 10 times worse after @entity5 's wettest winter on record			1
professor @entity119 , who is studying the erosion in @entity37 , said : ' on average this coastline near @entity122 retreats by 20 to 30cm per year			0
' but this year 's continuous gale force winds and giant storms have taken their toll and we 're looking at losing between two and three metres			1
' hundreds of miles of @entity68 and @entity70 ' coast is made up of similar sandy beaches and cliffs			0
meanwhile , @entity132 chairman @entity131 was accused yesterday of ignoring local advice about flooding on the @entity134			0
cllr @entity135 , who represents flooded @entity136 in @entity137 , said he warned the agency the river needed dredging as far back as 2009 , but was ignored			0
the flooding has been so bad it is even threatening this year 's @entity144 - @entity143 boat race with @entity144 's team fearing it is falling behind in training			0
@entity147 , the @entity5 rowing champion and double @entity149 gold medalist , who lives close to the @entity134 at @entity150 , says conditions are ' hardly ideal ' with the tidal stretch of the river flowing so quickly from @entity153 down			1
' i suspect it is @entity144 who are making more of a fuss about it as they have things a lot worse than @entity143 has at @entity154 ' he said			0
' if the @entity144 team has to train indoors on rowing machines because they ca n't go out on the river , it is n't a great feeling knowing that @entity143 are out on the water , but they must not think about the opposition			0
with outdoor events , these things happen			0
' organisers say the historic race will only go ahead if the @entity134 is judged to be safe - not just for the crews but for thousands of spectators who line the banks to cheer them on			0
@entity176 's crew members have now been unable to get out on the river for training sessions between @entity179 and @entity180 for more than 60 days because of the floods .			0

forecasters say the wet and windy conditions will continue
@entity5 's coastal areas will see gusts of wind reaching 70mph
experts say storms eroding coastline by metres rather than centimetres
