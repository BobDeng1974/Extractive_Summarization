by @entity0 last updated at 12:19 pm on 26th september 2011 dr @entity1 , head of the @entity2 , was forced to defend his remarks relatives should go into hospitals to help staff care for the elderly , according to a nursing leader			1
dr @entity1 , head of the @entity2 , said families should be encouraged to assist patients during mealtimes and take them to the toilet			1
he also wants hospitals to end restricted visiting times so relatives can stay as long as they want			0
dr @entity1 warned that on some wards there were too few nurses to help all frail patients eat their meals or go to the toilet			1
he said : ‘ if you have a 24 - bed ward and have got five nurses and everybody is having lunch at the same time and half the patients need feeding , it becomes difficult to get it all done			2
‘ if someone is coming in and sitting with their loved one , they are going to have the focused dedicated time			0
you get this business of wards , very , very busy people , patients dying to go to the loo , elderly patients wetting themselves , then they lie there feeling embarrassed – and it is about helping gran get out and go to the loo			2
’ figures show the average ‘ care of the elderly ’ ward has just one nurse for 11 patients – substantially fewer than in other parts of many hospitals			1
a report by the @entity2 last year found nurses on these wards were looking after an average of three more patients compared with children ’s wards , for example			1
only last week dr @entity1 warned that nurses were beginning their career unable to care for patients as they spend too much time in lecture halls			1
he also said untrained healthcare assistants with no medical qualifications now carry out many tasks once reserved for nurses , such as helping patients to eat and drink , cleaning bedsores and taking blood samples			2
pitching in : dr @entity1 warned that on some wards there were too few nurses to help all frail patients eat their meals or go to the toilet dr @entity1 has asked the @entity2 to consider ways to encourage more families to help out on wards			1
‘ if patients are in hospital then it is hospital staff who surely have a duty of care to look after patients ’ needs such as feeding them and ensuring they are clean , washed and dry ’ director general of saga ‘ the @entity90 is just not going to deal with it			1
neither are social services , ’ he said			0
‘ you have got to get maximum family involvement			0
‘ the services need to gear themselves up to make people aware : you are very welcome to come in and look after mum , dad , husband and wife			0
’ many hospitals will allow relatives to visit only during the afternoon , for example from 2pm to 8pm			0
and many have ‘ protective mealtimes ’ which ban visitors coming to the ward whilst food is being served in case it distracts patients from eating			2
but dr @entity1 wants visiting times to be more flexible , particularly during mealtimes so families can help patients eat			1
his views are backed up by dr @entity119 , chairman of the @entity120 , who said the @entity90 could not afford to employ staff to sit with the elderly for hours on end			1
‘ families should be more involved , ’ she said			2
‘ can we afford to have someone sitting by an elderly person in hospital and feeding them , which might take two or three hours			0
’ but dr @entity129 , director general of @entity130 , the over- 50s group , said the suggestion was ‘ astonishing ’			2
‘ if patients are in hospital then it is hospital staff who surely have a duty of care to look after patients ’ needs such as feeding them and ensuring they are clean , washed and dry , ’ she said			0
@entity90 figures show that last year 214,888 patients were discharged from hospital with some form of malnutrition			1
the @entity146 watchdog this year found that in some hospitals the elderly were going without food for several days			0
this means their immune systems will be far weaker and they are less able to cope with potentially fatal illnesses such as flu and pneumonia			0
lacking calcium and vitamin d , they will be prone to osteoporosis and associated hip fractures and other broken bones			0
some hospitals now employ volunteer feeders – members of the public who come in during meal times to help patients too frail to eat .			0
