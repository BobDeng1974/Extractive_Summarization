by @entity0 published : 10:55 est , 10 september 2013 updated : 11:19 est , 10 september 2013 a woman has told how a pioneering treatment allowed her to have a life - saving kidney transplant			1
@entity4 , 51 , who had chronic renal failure , has received a new kidney from her father , @entity7 , 71 , despite the fact he has a different blood type			1
until a few years ago , this would not have been possible as her body would have rejected the organ			2
it would not previously have been possible because they have different blood types in 2006 , ms @entity4 ’s life was turned upside down when she was diagnosed with kidney failure			1
she had been suffering from severe headaches for a year but assumed that they were migraines			0
eventually , however , her partner encouraged her to go to her gp and she was diagnosed with renal failure which would have proved fatal without treatment			1
ms @entity4 , from @entity28 , told @entity30 ’s @entity29 : ' my life was normal , you know , i was working , i was going out , having barbecues and all the normal things in life			1
‘ so , i knew no different			0
i was taking my health for granted at the time and i was taking my life for granted			0
’ she added : ' i went in to see the @entity25 with what i thought was a migraine and came out with chronic renal failure			1
' ms @entity4 was diagnosed with kidney failure after developing chronic headaches			1
for a year she had to spend six to eight hours every night on dialysis			0
she believed she would have to wait for a deceased donor as none of her family were matches as a result , ms @entity4 was put on the organ transplant waiting list and had to spend six to eight hours every night on dialysis because her kidneys were unable to clean her blood			1
she said : ' it keeps you alive but it does n’t give you life			0
it does n’t give you the energy to have a normal life			0
' all of ms @entity4 ’s family were tested to see if they could give her a kidney , but none were suitable matches			1
after she had been on dialysis for a year , ms @entity4 ’s father , @entity7 , read an article in the newspaper which reported that medics had managed to carry out a successful kidney transplant using a donor with a different blood type			1
he immediately called the hospital to establish whether this would mean that he could give his daughter one of his kidneys			0
ms @entity4 ( pictured before her illness ) said : ' my life was normal , i was working , i was going out , having barbecues and all the normal things in life			1
i was taking my health for granted at the time and i was taking my life for granted ' mr @entity86 told this morning : ' it was just so debilitating for her but through it all you are aware that this is not @entity4 as she is , this is @entity4 as an ill person and you tell yourself that			1
' he added : ‘ for me , i just wanted to see her well again			0
that was what i wanted and that ’s what we got			0
' surgeons at @entity28 ’s @entity100 carried out the transplant in april this year			0
ms @entity4 said : ‘ i have n’t looked back since the op , i really have n’t			2
it ’s been incredible for me			0
it gave me my life back			0
‘ the day after the operation , i woke up and i was on the phone at six in the morning ringing my mum to say hi			0
you get your life back straight away			0
' i probably feel better now - i ca n’t remember ever feeling as good because i was feeling ill for so long			0
' the transplant operation was carried out at @entity100 after mr @entity86 read an article which reported that a successful transplant between people with different blood types had been carried out her father added : ‘ i feel as though nothing has happened , it was just so routine			2
it was something that anybody could do			0
' until recently , transplants between people with different blood groups were impossible			0
with kidney transplants , not only did the blood group have to match , but the tissue type , too			2
if the blood types did not match , the organ would be rejected			2
rejection is caused by antibodies — proteins found in blood or other bodily fluids that act as the body ’s natural defence			2
they identify and neutralise foreign objects , such as bacteria and viruses , but also body tissue and blood groups that are different			0
ms @entity4 ( pictured with her father @entity7 , surgeon @entity144 , and @entity145 on this morning ) said : ' i have n't looked back since the op , i really have n't			1
it 's been incredible for me			0
it gave me my life back ' the new procedure involves ' washing ' the blood to remove the antibodies that cause the organ to be rejected so it no longer matters what blood type the donor is			1
it ’s thought 30 per cent of patients waiting for a kidney are being held back because though they have a live donor with the right tissue type , their blood types do n’t match			1
this technique means these patients can come off the waiting list			0
the key to success is ensuring all the antibodies — from the patient and the donor organ — are removed before the transplant and do not return			1
first , patients take drugs to stop their body producing antibodies and undergo a blood cleaning process , where the antibodies that cause rejection are filtered out			2
the drug the patient is given , rituximab , suppresses antibody production			1
this is administered ahead of the transplant along with other anti-rejection drugs			0
then the patient is attached to a machine to filter their blood of plasma — this is the liquid in blood that contains antibodies			1
before the patient ’s blood is passed back into their body , donated plasma is added — known as plasma exchange			2
the procedure takes three to four hours and is carried out on alternate days for a week before the transplant , and for two days afterwards			0
after the transplant , patients need to take immuno - suppressive drugs for life			1
mr @entity144 , a renal surgeon at @entity100 , told this morning : ‘ before this procedure , if you came forward as a live donor but your recipient and you did n’t match from a blood group point of view then it was n’t possible to do the transplant , but now it is			1
' we 've perfected this now within kidneys and now with the work being done with live liver transplants and live lung transplants hopefully it will allow the technology to be expanded to those areas as well			0
' he added : ‘ it is only within the last few years that it ’s been genuinely successful			0
’ until recently , transplants between people with different blood groups were impossible as the recipient 's body would reject the organ			2

@entity4 , 51 , was given a new kidney by her father , @entity7 , 71
she was diagnosed with renal failure after developing chronic headaches
*initially* , @entity7 was n't a suitable donor as he has a different blood type
a new ' blood washing ' procedure made the operation possible
involves removing antibodies that cause organ to be rejected
patient is given drugs to suppress antibody production and is attached to machine that filters their plasma to remove antibodies
they also have to take immuno - suppressive drugs for life
