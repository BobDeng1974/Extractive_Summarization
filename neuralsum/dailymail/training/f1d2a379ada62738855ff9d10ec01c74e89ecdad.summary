@entity2 , of @entity11 , @entity12 , learned to read while singing karaoke			1
the kindergartener also knows every element on the periodic table , every state in the @entity18 and every country in the world			1
while his classmates at @entity23 are busy learning their abcs , the 5 - year - old prodigy reads entire books , like @entity26 , and keeps himself informed about world events by reading newspapers in the bathroom			1

i noticed that he liked to look at maps so i put one up			0
in about a week 's time , he had memorized everything on it			0
he 's just always been very clever			0
' but the @entity62 said that they had no idea @entity2 , who is their firstborn , was truly gifted until this past february , when a family friend was shocked to discover that then - 4 - year - old boy was able to read a slogan off someone 's clothing			1
the parents said that because they had never had a child before , they just assumed that all kids develop at @entity2 ' breakneck pace			1
last month , the @entity76 had their son tested for intelligence quotient ( @entity78 ) , and the results confirmed their suspicions : the 5 - year - old scored in the 99.98 percentile in seven of eight categories on the @entity84			0
on the knowledge test , he scored just above genius level , earning him a spot in the exclusive @entity10 club where the qualifying iq score is 135			0

according to his parents , their son mastered letters , words and full sentences by singing karaoke at home , mr @entity2 told @entity122			1
these days , one of his favorite reading materials is @entity40 , which reports on technology			1
in fact , @entity2 ’ father told @entity122 in a phone interview thursday that his son is such a voracious reader that the family travels with a large supply of books and journals even when they go camping			1
the toddler could count to 1,000 even before setting foot in kindergarten and was able to put together a 1,000 - piece puzzle of the periodic table			1
a doctor who examined the little boy told the @entity62 that he is a very fortune child because most kids who display this kind of unique characteristics are usually ‘ twice exceptional ’ : intellectually gifted children who have some form of disability , such as autism			0
@entity2 , however , does not fall on the autistic spectrum , according to mr @entity2			2
last to know : @entity49 ( right ) and his wife ( left ) had no idea that their son ( center ) was a wunderkind until a friend noticed that the toddler could read welcome to the club : @entity2 scored 147 on an iq test , earning him a membership in exclusive @entity10 group , where the qualifying score in 135 keeping busy : @entity2 , pictured with his parents meeting the @entity165 mascot , also plays the piano and goes to soccer practice even before he could walk , @entity2 was absorbing information like a sponge from an itouch			1
nowadays , he uses an educational app on an @entity172 to teach himself second - grade math , reading and writing			0
@entity2 has an insatiable appetite for knowledge , and sometimes he even stumps his parents with his ceaseless questions			2
one day , the toddler was asking his father chemistry questions one after another until mr @entity2 finally ran out of answers			2
seeking to provide his son with the information he sought , @entity49 called @entity184 and asked to speak to the chemistry department , which ended up sending a graduate student to the @entity62 ’ home for dinner			0
but even the chemistry scholar was left confounded by some of @entity2 ’ sophisticated questions			2
in another instance reported by @entity193 , @entity2 got into a heated argument with his dad , who told him that the capital of @entity197 is @entity198			2
the 5 - year - old insisted that it is @entity201 - and he was right			0
' normal ' kid : a doctor who examined @entity2 told his parents that unlike many gifted children , the 5 - year - old does not fall on the autistic spectrum oddly enough , however , @entity2 has not been doing well in school			2
his father said the 5 - year - old can not sit through a lesson because he gets bored learning material that he already knows			0
as a result , he often gets in trouble for acting out			0
' he thinks he 's a bad kid but he just needs to be challenged , ' mr @entity2 told @entity51			2
@entity49 and his son have been regularly attending school board meetings asking the @entity216 to address the needs of students with special abilities by providing them with an intellectually stimulating environment , such as a gifted program			0
' if a kid was deaf or blind , the school district would do something about it , ' @entity2 said			2
' but for a profoundly gifted student , there is nothing			0
' however , @entity230 , the district 's director of curriculum and assessment , said the district does not have enough money in the budget to provide specialized services for gifted students			0
still , @entity2 ’ days are jam - packed with learning			2
he is being taught @entity105 at home and also takes formal language classes every saturday at @entity241			1
proof of brilliance : @entity49 submitted an application to a gifted program , which included some of @entity2 ' math worksheets ( left and right ) he also studies at the @entity249 after - school learning program for children , takes piano lessons and goes to soccer practice			1
but the @entity76 are still hoping to find an educational setting for their wunderkind to meet his rapidly evolving intellectual needs			0
last month , mr @entity2 submitted an application on @entity2 ' behalf to the @entity257			0
while they await a response , @entity49 said he is happy to teach his son what he knows about the boy 's two new passions : black holes and astrophysics .			1
