the final few days of april last year were the worst of @entity2 ’s life			1
her one - year - old daughter , @entity3 , was seriously ill in hospital with a mystery condition that gave her seizures and made her scream out in pain			1
‘ she could n’t sit up or lift her head , ’ says @entity2 , 30			1
’ @entity2 , an assistant sports director , had rushed @entity3 to the @entity18 after she suddenly took a turn for the worse following a week - long chest infection			1
tests over a week at the hospital brought bad news			0
although doctors could n’t identify the cause , an mri scan showed that @entity3 had brain damage			1
other tests , including a heart @entity29 and blood tests , indicated her organs were starting to fail			0
@entity2 and her husband @entity33 , 34 , a sports development manager , were warned that their daughter could die within a couple of months			2
‘ apart from some physiotherapy , the doctors said there were no potential treatments , ’ says @entity2 , who lives with @entity33 , their four - year - old son @entity37 and @entity33 ’s daughter @entity39 , eight , as well as @entity3 , in @entity40 , @entity41			1
poppy in hospital in late april this year , taken with her grandmother @entity48 ‘ we took her home and tried to come to terms with it			1
losing a child — that ’s the worst thing you can hear as a parent			0
’ @entity33 adds : ‘ we were talking about things like funerals			2
’ but a phone call a few weeks later brought some hope			0
@entity3 had tested positive for @entity10 ( @entity10 ) — a rare genetic condition that affects approximately one in 100,000 babies			1
it is so - called because it can cause urine to have a syrupy smell			1
she ’d had the blood test for @entity10 after a doctor at the @entity18 was advised to test her by a neurologist , who recognised that trouble sitting up was a symptom of the disorder			2
another mri scan and genetic tests confirmed the diagnosis			0
it meant doctors could now treat @entity3			2
‘ she was still very poorly , but there was a chance of keeping her , so this diagnosis brought some relief , ’ says @entity2			1
@entity10 causes problems digesting certain amino acids — the building blocks of protein			2
these can build up to a toxic level , severely affecting the baby ’s brain and muscle function			0
this can lead to problems sitting up and moving limbs , as the build - up interferes with signals from the brain to muscles in the arms and legs			0
the digestive system can also be affected , leading to poor feeding and vomiting			0
untreated , the build - up can lead to coma and permanent brain damage			0
but if @entity10 is diagnosed early , babies can be treated with a low - protein diet and go on to live a normal life			1
starting this week , @entity10 is being added to the @entity106 , along with three other conditions , in @entity108 and @entity109			2
' if it was n’t for the neurologist thinking of @entity10 , things could have been very different , ' said @entity2 currently , all babies are given a heel - prick blood test at five days old to check for five conditions , including the blood disorder sickle cell disease and cystic fibrosis			1
spotting the ‘ new ’ conditions earlier could mean the difference between a healthy , active life and an early death			2
in addition to @entity10 , these conditions are homocystinuria , glutaric aciduria type 1 and isovaleric acidaemia			2
all are caused by an inability to process amino acids and can kill if not treated			0
if the baby survives , it can be left severely disabled or brain - damaged			0
but detected early , they can be managed with similar low - protein diets to the one for @entity10 ( avoiding proteins such as meat , fish and eggs and taking synthetic proteins to replace the amino acids sufferers ca n’t digest )			1
although rare ( each affects around 25 babies each year ) screening for the conditions will save or vastly improve many lives			1
the changes come after a successful pilot run by the @entity146 and @entity148 ’s @entity147			0
professor @entity149 , director of newborn screening at @entity150 , who headed the programme , says it could ‘ radically improve the quality of life of children who are detected			0
for some , it could mean the difference between being in a wheelchair and playing football with their friends ’			0
in the pilot , 437,000 babies in five cities were tested between july 2012 and july 2013			2
it identified 40 babies at risk — 12 were diagnosed with one of the four ‘ new ’ conditions and were then treated			1
while the new blood tests have been welcomed , countries such as @entity172 and @entity173 already screen babies for 28 conditions — rather than nine , as is now the case here			0
campaigners believe we should follow suit and extend our test to even more conditions , such as @entity185 ’s disease , a genetic disorder that can cause brain damage , which affects more than 100,000 people worldwide			1
‘ there are other disorders children are being severely disabled by , or dying from , which could be screened for with the heel - prick test , ’ says @entity189 , executive director of the @entity190 , which has organised an online petition calling for the test to be extended			1
all @entity106 screening programmes must be assessed and passed by the @entity199 ( @entity201 @entity200 )			0
@entity2 with husband @entity33 , their four - year - old son @entity37 and @entity33 ’s daughter @entity39 , eight , as well as @entity3 who is now aged 19 months and learning to walk and talk as normal dr @entity206 , its director of programmes , says : ‘ we have taken a very rigorous view of wanting to know , condition by condition , that we do more good than harm at reasonable cost			1
’ she adds that any @entity201 test must be accurate , as this minimises ‘ false positives ’ , and there must be an effective treatment available			2
@entity201 @entity200 is considering ten conditions to add to the test , including @entity221 syndrome , an enzyme deficiency that can cause organ damage , which affects around seven babies a year in the @entity201			1
@entity2 welcomes the new tests , but says she is concerned health workers may not be prepared : ‘ when i was last in hospital with @entity3 in november , none of the doctors or nurses knew about @entity10 — or that screening would start in january			1
’ @entity3 ’s diagnosis came just in time			2
after three months , she was back to good health			0
now aged 19 months , she ’s learning to walk and talk as normal			0
however , mri scans show she has ‘ small pockets ’ of damage all over her brain			0
how this will affect her will not become clear until she is older , but a recent scan has shown signs of improvement to her nervous system			0
‘ it ’s been a miraculous recovery , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ if it was n’t for the neurologist thinking of @entity10 , things could have been very different			1
' without the test , we would n’t be here now			0
