by @entity0 follow @ @ neilashton _ a couple of weeks before the end of the season , @entity2 ’s new executive director @entity1 felt compelled to clear up a few outstanding issues			1
it was a spot of housekeeping , a reminder that everything was neat and tidy and in good working order as @entity2 prepared to finish the season in eighth place			2
according to @entity1 , in a briefing with the media that was widely broadcast on april 27 , there was nothing to see and nobody would be leaving @entity2			1
dream move : @entity19 joined boyhood club @entity20 for £ 4million after five seasons on the south coast is that the way to @entity25 ? @entity26 was quick to depart @entity27 's after leading @entity2 to eighth in the @entity28 @entity1 had been monitoring the news and was so irritated by the consistent reports linking manager @entity26 and many of his players with moves elsewhere he felt a declaration was in order			1
@entity26 , he claimed , spoke with @entity1 for an hour a day , sometimes more , at @entity2 ’s training complex to discuss transfer targets and the club ’s pre-season programme			1
all was well , he said			0
contract negotiations with the @entity42 manager would progress smoothly , they just had to get the final two games of the season out of the way first and then it would all play out			0
@entity1 ’s second point was about the players			2
there had been no bids and reports that they were negotiating ‘ stellar transfer fees ’ and salaries were well wide of the mark			0
well , well , wide of the mark			0
he hammered home this point several times			0
the problem with a well - intentioned and earnest speech like this is when the protagonists have very differing opinions on how it will all play out at the end of the season			0
@entity26 was not about to walk out with two games left , against @entity67 and @entity68 , of the season			0
that , in his mind , would come later			0
the problem with @entity1 ’s endless cups of coffee in the manager ’s office after training is that you ca n’t always see the bigger picture			2
take @entity26 ’s surprise visit to the @entity79 for the @entity81 quarter - final first leg between @entity82 and @entity83 , as an example			1
on the move ? saints skipper @entity87 has also been widely linked with a move with @entity20 and @entity90 favourites to secure his services @entity26 would be hard pushed to pass off a trip to @entity93 to watch two of @entity96 's superpowers as a scouting mission			1
he was there in case it all went wonky for @entity82 coach @entity101 , putting himself in @entity104 football ’s shop window at a time when he knew he was likely to leave @entity2			2
as soon as the season was over - and @entity90 had sacked @entity107 - chairman @entity106 began negotiating his release from @entity27 ’s			2
@entity26 ’s departure is no reason to panic , but the uncertainty surrounding the players is of far greater concern to @entity2 ’s supporters			1
@entity116 : the excellent @entity117 has excelled in his first season in the @entity28 of course there were no bids for @entity2 ’s players at the time of @entity1 ’s housekeeping address because @entity20 , for example , were distracted by the title race			1
in any event , no matter how much interest @entity127 had in @entity19 , @entity87 and the outstanding @entity117 , the transfer window was not even open			1
more on them in a moment			0
in between @entity26 ’s departure to @entity25 and the completion of @entity19 ’s £ 4m move to @entity20 , two of @entity2 ’s outstanding academy coaches have been fired by @entity1			1
this is all part of a fairly petty power battle between @entity1 , the under 21 development coach with @entity139 and @entity140			0
the departed : @entity141 ( left ) left @entity27 's in january , while @entity1 promised there would be no - one leaving at the end of the season to give you an idea of the esteem the pair are held in by the young academy graduates , @entity145 pointedly went off message while he was away with @entity152 to tweet that it was a bad decision			1
there has been friction in this area of the club for some time , mainly because the @entity158 served up by @entity139 and @entity140 would bypass @entity161 ’s @entity160 side to be involved with the senior side			2
that is a reflection of the quality that @entity145 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 possess			0
it is a great pity because @entity2 ’s academy system and the commitment to youth is the envy of not only @entity28 football , but @entity96 too			1
the sale of @entity19 makes sense , particularly when a club is willing to absorb his wages , in excess of £ 50,000 a week , at the age of 32			0
homegrown talent ? @entity145 is another one from @entity2 academy 's famed production line who looks set to leave for @entity1 , the wider issue is whether he can really convince his captain @entity87 , plus @entity145 and @entity117 to stay at @entity27 ’s			1
there was a time under former executive chairman @entity141 when this club had ambitions to finish fourth and qualify for the @entity81			1
that feels like a long way off now			0
@entity87 is convinced he played his last game for the club on the final day of the season and @entity145 is agitating for a move to @entity68			2
if they all leave , then @entity1 ’s words will have a hollow ring to them .			0

@entity2 ’s new executive director @entity1 *announced* there was nothing to see and nobody would be leaving @entity2 in april
fast - forward less than two months and the club 's manager @entity26 and top - scorer @entity19 have departed
skipper @entity87 , *defender* @entity145 and *defensive* rock @entity117 look likely to follow
