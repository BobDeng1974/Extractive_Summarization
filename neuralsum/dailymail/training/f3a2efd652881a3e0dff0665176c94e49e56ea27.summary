a rich burgundy or crisp chardonnay may be your tipple of choice			0
but a handful of 1,500 - year - old charred grape seeds could help scientists recreate one of the finest ancient wines			1
it is the first time that seeds have been found , offering hope that the taste of ' @entity15 wine ' could finally be revealed			1
a handful of charred grape seeds ( pictured ) could help scientists recreate one of the finest ancient wines , called the ' wine of the @entity21 , ' which according to historical sources , was one the the finest and most delicious produced around 1,500 years ago in the @entity23 the seeds come from grapes that were used to produce the wine - also known as ' wine of the @entity21 ' - which according to historical accounts , was one of the finest and most renowned wines in the empire that stretched from @entity32 to @entity33			1
they were found at the @entity36 excavation site in the @entity21 – a semi desert region of southern @entity38 - during a joint dig by the @entity40 and the @entity41			1
‘ the vines growing in the @entity21 today are @entity48 varieties , whereas the @entity21 vine was lost to the world , ’ said director of the excavation , professor @entity44 of the @entity45			0
‘ our next job is to recreate the ancient wine , and perhaps in that way we will be able to reproduce its taste and understand what made the @entity21 wine so fine			1

the city of @entity36 is mapped earlier excavations of the site have unearthed the terraces where the vines were cultivated , the wineries where wine was produced , and the jugs in which the wine was stored and exported – but until now , no grape seeds were recovered			1

the seeds come from grapes used to produce the ' wine of the @entity21 '			1
experts hope they could be used to recreate the ' @entity15 wine , ' which was one of finest made in the @entity23			1
it was expensive and considered to be of very high quality , but because none has survived , wine experts are unsure what made it taste so good			0
@entity21 wine was lost to the world and the vines may have been a native species , which are now extinct			2
there is a chance that they could equally have been sourced from @entity97 or @entity98 , like the modern vines in the @entity21 region today			0
researchers will now join forces with biologists to sequence the dna of the seeds to discover their origin			1
understanding more about the seeds , may also show how the grape variety was suited to such arid conditions - and this may even be used to unlock the secret of growing grapes with less water today			2
byzantine sources tell of @entity15 wine which was named after the port from which it was shipped to all corners of the empire			1
it was expensive and considered to be of very high quality , but because none has survived , wine experts are unsure what made it taste so good			0
excavations of the site have previously unearthed the terraces where the vines were cultivated , the wineries where wine was produced , and the jugs in which the wine was stored and exported – but until now , no grape seeds were recovered			1
they were discovered in one of the ancient city ’s rubbish dumps , or middens , which were preserved almost completely intact and now mark its borders , professor @entity44 said			0
archaeologists know from findings of pottery and coins that the tips were used when the city was at the height of its economic success			0
@entity36 collapsed in the mid-seventh century for reasons unknown to historians and it seems the city and its rubbish dumps , were swiftly abandoned			0
pottery vessels used for storage , cooking and serving were discovered in a particularly high concentration in one midden , including @entity15 jugs used to hold @entity21 wine			2
the grape seeds were found along with other biological remains , such as the bones of imported @entity167 fish and shellfish from the @entity169 , indicating the vast wealth of the @entity23 city ’s residents			1
archaeologists carefully sifted through the remains and used a technique so that soil sunk to the bottom of a container full of water and the remains floated to the top			0
professor @entity44 said : ‘ maybe the secret to the @entity21 wine ’s international prestige lay in the method by which the vines were cultivated in the @entity21 ’s arid conditions			2
' a stock picture of the view over the desert is shown ‘ after washing the dirt and gently sifting the findings all that remained was to separate the botanical findings , which included seeds , pits and plants remains , from small animal bones , which included the remains of rodents that were drawn to the refuse , ’ professor @entity44 said			0
experts are unsure whether the vines from which the famous wine was produced throughout the @entity23 , were imported from elsewhere			2
there is a chance that they may have been sourced from @entity97 or @entity98 , like the modern vines in the region today , or that they were native varieties that have now been lost			0

a stock image of a vineyard in @entity228 , @entity98 , is shown by doing this , connoisseurs could recreate the ancient wine and unlock the secret of why it was so highly throughout the @entity23 — in @entity234 , @entity33 , @entity98 , and @entity32			2
professor @entity44 added : ‘ @entity48 varieties require copious amounts of water			0
today it is less of a problem thanks to technology , but it is unlikely that that was the case 1,500 years ago			0

grape seeds were found in an ancient rubbish dump in @entity254 , @entity38
come from grapes used to make the ' wine of @entity21 , ' or ' @entity15 wine '
@entity260 was said to be among the best wines of the @entity23
biologists will sequence the dna of the seeds to discover their origin
study could be used to recreate the wine and find out how good it tastes
