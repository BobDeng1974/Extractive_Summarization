by @entity0 @entity1 : 18:35 est , 17 december 2013 @entity2 : 14:01 est , 18 december 2013 @entity4 ’s long - rumored autoplay ads are now a reality			1
the social network announced tuesday that it will begin rolling out its own version of the boorish video ads this week to a small number of users who might not mind them as much as they think			1
the launch comes only one day after a report suggesting such ads were imminent as @entity4 looks to make inroads into the upwards of $ 66billion spent on television advertising this year			1
they will play the second they appear on a user ’s screen , but will have no sound unless tapped or clicked on – solving one of the major complaints more internet surfers have about auto - play ads. the ads also will not autoplay on mobile devices unless they are connected to @entity40 , which will limit the hit people take to their data plans			1
the catch to the ads not playing unless mobile devices are connected to @entity40 is that the @entity4 app will download them – which will eat further into precious storage space already consumed by music , photos and apps			1
once the video ad is finished playing , a carousel giving people the option of viewing more video ads will appear			2
the first advertiser taking advantage of the new platform is @entity59 – with an ad for the film ‘ divergent ’ that was made specifically for @entity4			0
these features do n’t appear to be set in stone , as @entity4 said the ads are open for further tweaking during this ‘ intial , limited test			1
’ ‘ we ’ll continue to refine this new way for brands to tell stories on @entity4 to ensure the best experience for people and marketers			0
’ more choices : a carousel with three more ads appears after the initial ad finishes playing despite the rollout not yet being site - wide , the backlash has already begun			2
‘ this feature does not improve my experience on @entity4 , and actually it makes my experience worse than before , ’ wrote one user			0
‘ please provide a way to turn @entity85 auto - play for those of us who do not want it ! ’ another person pleaded			2
the announcement came only one day after the @entity91 reported the ads ’ launch would happen later this week			0
the @entity91 originally reported over the summer the ads were imminent , @entity4 delayed the launch ‘ fearing ads could annoy users			0
’ @entity4 ’s foray into autoplay video ads comes only one month after @entity100 – which is owned by @entity4 – launched video ads of its own .			0

the ads are currently in a limited beta
sound will not play unless they are clicked or tapped on
they will not play on mobile devices unless they are connected to @entity40
