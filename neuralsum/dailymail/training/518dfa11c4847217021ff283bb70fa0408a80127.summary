@entity0 yesterday outlined plans to close a loophole that lets companies such as @entity4 and @entity5 avoid paying taxes on overseas profits			1
the @entity9 president used the @entity10 for 2016 to impose a one - off 14 per cent tax on profits stashed abroad by @entity9 corporate giants , the huge sums expected to be raised - nearly £ 160 billion - will pay for improvements to roads and bridges in the @entity9 , before the rate is increased to 19 per cent in future			1
@entity9 president @entity0 speaks at the @entity20 earlier today to deliver the administration 's fiscal year budget for 2016 the move comes amid an international backlash against firms such as @entity26 and @entity27 that have been accused of avoiding tax on the profits earned in countries around the world , including the @entity32			1
but the tax raid proposed by the @entity34 president needs to be approved by @entity36 - controlled @entity35 – setting the scene for months of wrangling			0
prominent republicans have already the criticised the ‘ tax and spend ’ budget although it has been previously thought that @entity9 companies have around £ 1.4trillion of profits stashed overseas			1
firms do not currently have to pay @entity9 tax on foreign profits unless the money is brought back into @entity9			1
critics claim that the huge piles of cash stored overseas is down to aggressive tax planning policies by @entity9 companies , but businesses argue that the country ’s tax rates are uncompetitive			1
the top rate of corporation tax in the @entity9 is 35 per cent compared with 21 per cent in @entity32			2
@entity58 has said @entity32 corporation tax will fall to 20 per cent in april – but @entity60 has pledged to reverse this tax cut if it wins power in the general election in may			2
in the last @entity64 @entity58 , pictured , also unveiled the so - called ‘ @entity26 tax ’ , which aims to target the profits earned by multinationals in the @entity32 but diverted elsewhere in the last @entity64 mr @entity58 also unveiled the so - called ‘ @entity26 tax ’ , which aims to target the profits earned by multinationals in the @entity32 but diverted elsewhere			1
president @entity0 plans to go much further , however , raising far higher sums of money by targeting the profits both diverted and earned overseas			2
he wants to levy a 14 per cent one - off ‘ transition ’ tax on @entity9 profits held overseas as well as a 19 per cent levy on future profits as they are earned			1
the @entity79 expects the one - off levy to raise £ 158 billion which will be used to fund infrastructure projects in the @entity9 including new roads and bridges			2
the proposals effectively amount to a huge tax raid on technology and drug companies that stash profits overseas in low tax countries such as @entity90 and @entity91			0
‘ this transition tax would mean that companies have to pay @entity9 tax right now rather than being able to delay paying any @entity9 tax indefinitely , ’ a @entity79 official said			0
a report by research firm @entity98 last year showed that @entity99 had the most profits stored overseas at £ 73billion			0
tech giants @entity5 and @entity4 and drugs companies @entity102 and @entity104 made up the rest of the top five			2
the proposals were part of a budget that was aimed at boosting @entity9 ’s @entity110 through higher taxes on corporations and the rich			0
mr @entity0 said : ‘ this country ’s better off than it was four years ago , but what we also know is that wages and incomes for middle class families are just now ticking up			0
they have n’t been keeping pace over the last 30 years compared to corporate profits and what ’s happening to folks in the very top			0
’ the @entity10 , for the fiscal year starting on october 1 , forecast the deficit falling from 3.2 per cent of national income this year to 2.5 per cent or £ 315billion next year			0
the deficit would stabilise at that rate over the next 10 years , not rising above 2.6 per cent of national income under the plans			0
the @entity131 estimates that @entity58 ’s @entity26 tax will raise just £ 25 million in the next financial year , rising to £ 270 million the following year			1
this figure will rise to £ 355 million by 2019/20 - still a drop in the ocean next to @entity0 ’s tax .			0
