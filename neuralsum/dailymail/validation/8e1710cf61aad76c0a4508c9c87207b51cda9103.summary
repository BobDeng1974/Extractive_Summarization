@entity0 responded in style to revelations that he had been knocked - out while boxing in his own kitchen , by leading @entity4 to victory , scoring a wonderful goal and producing a punch - drunk celebration			1
a resounding 3 - 0 win against @entity9 kept @entity4 in the top four of the @entity11 and lifted spirits at @entity13			1
the goals came from @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 , who had been in the spotlight on a day when @entity19 broadcast video footage of him being floored by a punch from @entity23 defender @entity22 during an impromptu sparring session			1
@entity4 captain @entity0 re-enacted a video of him boxing a former team - mate @entity17 punched the air , before falling backwards in a similar fashion to what can be seen in the video @entity17 manages to keep a straight face as he falls directly backwards onto the @entity13 turf the two footballers , wearing boxing gloves , square up in @entity17 's kitchen and spar for a few seconds before @entity22 lands a jab to put the @entity38 and @entity4 skipper flat on his back , seemingly unconscious			1
@entity17 voiced his disappointment that a private moment , filmed inside his home on february 22 , had been made public , a view shared by @entity45 , who was clearly irritated by the story and seemed unperturbed by the nature of his captain 's pastime			1
after scoring @entity4 's third against @entity9 , @entity17 let fly with a flurry of fake punches and fell on his back , much as he did in the video clip taken last month , although the @entity13 turf seemed to provide a far softer landing than his kitchen tiles			1
' that 's the world we live in today , ' said @entity17			1
' it was a few mates in a private house which has somehow managed to get on the front page of a national newspaper			0
i have to accept that			0
it was me and a few friends joking around			1
' it 's my own home , i know it 's got out but it 's not public			0

' i 've just been focused on the game , it 's more interesting for other people rather than for myself			0
you 've seen that i 've done a professional job , got on with the game and gladly helped my team win 3 - 0			1
' the @entity38 captain stretches his hands out behind him to break his fall as he hits the ground @entity17 was joined by laughing team - mates as he fell on the ground during his celebration for a few seconds , @entity17 lay on the @entity13 pitch with his arms spread wide while being congratulated @entity16 admitted the players had been teasing @entity17 about his sparring antics , while @entity15 revealed how the skipper had delivered a rousing speech to the squad in the team hotel on the eve of the game			1
' i was aware of the speech but was not in the meeting because the captain has his own privilege , ' said @entity107			2
' the players knew this game was massive and the captain has to do something to help the players , the manager or the club			2
' i do n't want to answer questions about what happened			2
what is this world , twisted ? i do n't have any comment			0
it is ridiculous that we have to talk about such things			0
' the @entity123 was happier to discuss @entity17 's performance			1
' it 's always how @entity0 plays , ' said @entity107			1
' with a lot of commitment and that 's nice to see			0
' we have waited a long time for such a victory , with a very good performance against a very good team , so i am very pleased			2
it was nice after the defeat against @entity137 to do that in the next game against a competitor			0
we were compact and scored beautiful goals			2
@entity17 slots the ball past @entity144 to put @entity4 3 - 0 up against @entity9 @entity145 and @entity15 arrive on the scene to celebrate with the @entity4 captain @entity145 laughs as @entity17 falls backwards as part of his humorous boxing celebration at @entity13 @entity17 waves to the crowd ; his goal put @entity4 3 - 0 up against @entity9 ' we were lucky that the first chance was a goal , and then you raise your confidence			1
we also played quicker than usual and that depends on the confidence of your players			0
@entity9 are a team who wants to play , therefore you have more time and space to play the game			1
' after a weekend when @entity166 and @entity167 dropped points , @entity107 declared @entity4 in the race for second , but would not declare a late charge for the title			1
' we go step by step , it 's a rat race , ' he said			0
' we have made a big step but we have to go to @entity178 next , also a competitor of ours			0
' @entity17 added : ' the first half was probably the best 45 minutes we 've played this season			2
in the second half we did n't want to lose advantage of the three goals we had			0
we defended really well and made sure we 've seen the game out			0
' we knew it was a big game			0
with @entity167 losing and @entity190 drawing it was a big game for us			0
we 've taken the points off @entity9 , so it 's a great three points for us			2
