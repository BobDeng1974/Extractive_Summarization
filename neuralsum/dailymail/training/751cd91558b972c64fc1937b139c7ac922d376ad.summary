by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:15 est , 1 march 2013 updated : 11:08 est , 2 march 2013 @entity2 , @entity3 president described the proposal as a ' poll tax on wheels ' millions of motorists could be hit with new road tolls and extra ‘ access charges ’ for using motorways under plans to be unveiled before the @entity12			1
ministers are to publish two documents giving the green light for private companies to run @entity18 ’s roads - and charge drivers for the privilege - later this month			1
under the plans drivers who use motorways and trunk roads could pay an ‘ access charge ’ that could add £ 150 a year to the cost of motoring			1
a report by @entity28 - who helped run the @entity29 - will outline a wide number of options to let firms levy tolls on new roads and existing routes where road capacity is increased through extra lanes or widening schemes			1
senior government sources say a green paper published by the @entity41 at the same time - the week before the budget on march 20 -- will make clear that ministers are most keen on a scheme to charge motorists extra for using popular roads if they have a heavy car or a gas guzzler with high co2 emissions			1
the government wants to combine the higher fees for heavy use of popular roads with a reform of vehicle excise duty , which currently raises £ 6 billion a year			1
one option would see all motorists pay a new , lower level of the tax , allowing them to drive on local roads and smaller a-roads			1
those who want to use the country ’s trunk - road network - motorways and major a-roads - would pay further charges based on how often the roads are used and the weight or emissions of the vehicle			1
senior sources say a flat - rate charge would penalise the drivers of the most environmentally - friendly cars most , since they already pay lower rates of road tax and would not benefit from a cut in the basic rate of a new levy			1
‘ a flat rate charge is not likely to work because there will be too many losers and it is politically unsaleable , ’ the source said			2
‘ the more realistic options will mean making distinctions on the basis of weight or emissions			2
they would vary from car to car			0
’ the move will be highly controversial			0
the @entity3 has warned that a two tier duty would mean better - off households would pay for the motorway charge , while poorer households would opt to use only local roads			1
@entity2 , the @entity3 ’s president , described the ideas as a ‘ poll tax on wheels ’			0
number plate recognition technology could be used to force motorists with higher emissions to pay to use popular roads but the necessary number plate recognition technology to levy the charges has already been pioneered by @entity107 ’s congestion charging scheme and is also to be used for the @entity110 road crossing of the @entity111			1
insiders say regulations setting up the @entity110 spy cameras can be used as enabling legislation for future pay - as - you - drive tolling schemes			2
another option is to replace the annual road duty charge on cars with a one - off , upfront charge on new vehicles when they are sold			2
the @entity123 and the green paper will outline a range of radical possibilities for funding new roads , which could see whole regions of the road network handed over to private firms			2
big construction and infrastructure companies - such as @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 - could run and maintain the existing roads , build new roads and add new lanes to existing highways			2
they could receive a ring - fenced share of the near £ 6billion raised each year from road tax as a ‘ shadow toll ’ or subsidy paid directly from the @entity145 according to how many vehicles used their roads			2
firms given long franchises or leases of ten to 20 years on sections of motorway or major dual carriageway could widen them to create additional ‘ pay - as - you - go ’ lanes that drivers could use to beat congestion			1
these are dubbed ‘ @entity163 lanes ’ in the @entity164 because only wealthy drivers of executive cars can afford to use them			0
to counter the power of private sector operators , the plan envisages the creation of a watchdog regulator , which some have already dubbed the @entity171 or ‘ @entity172			0
’ the plans , which have the support of @entity175 and the @entity145 , are less popular in the @entity176 , where ministers are concerned they will have to sell controversial plans for road charging to sceptical voters			0
the source added : ‘ the prime minister has made clear that he is keen on getting private finance into the roads network , ’ a senior source said			0
' roads have been underfunded under successive governments and we know investment in roads can do a lot of good			0
but there are no easy solutions			0
' the @entity194 said : ‘ it looks like the greenest of @entity197 papers with lots of options left open			0
it seems the @entity145 , which will receive the money , are far keener on this than the @entity176 which will have to fend off all the brickbats			0
they know they ’ll get the blame			0
they know that there is already resistance to paying for a service such which currently costs them nothing			0
’ @entity210 , @entity212 ’s @entity211 said : ’ this shows that there are still massive questions for the government to answer on the future of roads , and taxpayers and road users need answers			0
‘ the government needs to make clear if any proposals on new road financing will make it more expensive to drive , and if so where and who will set any new charges ? ‘ will it be the government , or another regulator modelled on the toothless @entity171 , or will @entity216 cave in again to private companies and give them a free pass like they have for rail fares ? ’ she added : ' importantly the government need to explain why higher charges on our motorways wo n't just fuel an explosion of traffic on smaller roads and in towns and villages , adding to congestion and reducing air quality in the places where people live			1

motorists with high emissions could pay extra for using popular roads
number plate recognition used for @entity107 congestion charge could be used
