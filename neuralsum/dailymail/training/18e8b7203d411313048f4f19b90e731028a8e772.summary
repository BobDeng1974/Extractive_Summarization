by @entity0 there 's nothing @entity3 hates more than a dull wine			1
actually , there 's also ' nipping ' ( more of which later ) , supermarket wine buyers and an untidy sock drawer			1
award - winning wine writer @entity3 is a meticulous man who likes everything in its place – which , for 97 per cent of wines currently on sale in @entity13 , he says , is down the plughole			1
' a lot of wine is boring as sin , ' he says			1
' i only write up three per cent of the wines i taste , the rest are awful			1
if you ca n't inject personality or passion into a bottle of wine , why are you doing it ? i tasted more than 4,000 bottles to find 200 for my wine collection			1
' @entity3 has tasted more than 4,000 bottles of wine for his collection of 200 he 's referring to his 200 finest - value wines in the @entity13 today , which we 're giving away as a guide in @entity33 this week and next			1
' i had to kiss a lot of frogs to find the right bottles , ' he says			1
' @entity37 and @entity39 's wines are pretty good this year , but @entity40 is shocking			1
supermarket buyers are now bean counters			0
they 're not talented palates			0
it 's all about making money			2
it 's not about finding an incredible wine and launching it onto the market			1
' surely he 's not referring to those half - price gems we pile into our trolleys ? ' that 's nonsense , ' he says			1
' the price it 's reduced to is one they 're still making the right margin at			2
so , invariably , it 's an inflated price beforehand			2
' he shakes his head in despair			0
@entity3 , 46 , is passionate about wine - good wine enjoyed with food , not the cheap ' boring stuff ' you stick in the fridge door and ' nip away at ' to unwind			1
he 's referring to the trend among middle - class women of so - called oblivion - drinking to blot out stress			1
' by the time the husband comes home from work , you 've had a bottle			0
i think it 's pretty desperate			2
my mantra is that wine tastes better with food and food tastes better with wine			1
do n't nip away at a bottle when you 're just pottering – and i never , ever drink on my own			0
' @entity3 tastes 40,000 bottles of wine a year hang on @entity3 , you 're paid to taste 40,000 bottles of wine a year , surely you get unsteady on your feet at the end of a heavy day ? ' @entity97 no , ' he says with such horror i might as well have suggested we share a bottle of @entity101			1
' i do n't drink them all			0
i spit them out at work			0
outside of work we have dinner parties , cook and taste lots of different bottles			2
you often pour away what 's left if you 've not finished the glass , to taste the next one			2
it 's a bit nerdy , but fun and ... ' and he 's off , enthusing about the wonders of the sort of wine you do n't stick in the fridge and nip			1
but the thing about @entity3 is he makes it so understandable to those of us who do n't know our sancerre from our sauvignon blanc			1
which is how he 's made his name as one of the most influential voices in the wine world			1
' i have a big mouth and lots of energy , ' he says			0
' i do n't believe there 's such a thing as a natural palate			2
i could teach you to be a great taster			0
it 's about practice and memory			2
' i use a lot of imagery			0
for example , a gorgeous woman would be a sauvignon blanc from the @entity152			0
the sun does n't beat down as hard there as it does in @entity155 or @entity156			0
it 's going to give you a tang on the palate and a nice smell like the perfume of a girl who wanders up and gives you a “ wow ”			2
it 's about the shape , the curves , the length , the beauty and the finesse of the wine			1
' what about a bunny boiler ? ' grapes from the @entity176 further south in @entity177			0
they enjoy getting ripe and full of sugar and you can ferment them up to 15 per cent alcohol so you 've got a white wine that has the alcohol of a butch red wine			2
they rush up to you and you have n't got any control over how it hits you			0
the memory is hazy – “ did i like it ? i 'm not sure ” – and the hangover is dreadful			0
' ' i use a lot of imagery			0
for example , a gorgeous woman would be a sauvignon blanc from the @entity152 ' @entity198 , he seems to know as much about women as wine			2
@entity3 , who has two daughters from an earlier marriage , adores his wife @entity203			1
if she were a wine , he says , she 'd be a @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 , because ' of the heavenly flavour of the pinot noir , the romantic vineyard name and the fact i bought a bottle of it to drink the day after we got married '			2
they married four years ago after meeting at a wine tasting			2
@entity203 was ' a bit of a nipper but i 've persuaded her over to my side '			0
he 's had less joy organising her sock drawer			2
@entity3 , as i 've said , likes everything in its place			1
during the hour - and - a - half we 've been talking he 's lined up all the cutlery on the table like soldiers on parade			1
' @entity203 gets infuriated by it			0
i 'm super-tidy – @entity233			0
i ca n't work until the house is perfect			0
' it must be perfect all the time then , as he 's a prodigious worker who 's published 14 books			2
@entity3 's passion for wine began at the age of eight when his family were living in @entity242			1
his father was the @entity245 head of the huge multinational @entity246 and his mother a brilliant cook who entertained regularly at home			0
@entity3 chucked in his degree to work in a wine shop in @entity252 and by 22 he 'd been hired as wine buyer for @entity256 's @entity255 restaurant ' we had an entrance hall with a staircase that went round in a circle and a balcony at the top			1
i 'd be there in my dressing gown , pyjamas and little slippers watching these top people come in			0
i 'd say hello and then pour the wine			0
i remember being given a taste and reading the labels			0
i was fascinated with labels because i figured out that was the birth certificate of the wine			0
i 'd look up the vineyards in an atlas and see the villages where these wines came from			0
' at ten he went to the @entity279 in @entity280 where he discovered rugby , beer and girls , but his passion for wine persisted			0
' i had a fridge in my room with wine in it and always entertained - particularly girls			1
' after school he began to study physics at @entity294 's in @entity295 , where a master noted he was ' not much of a physicist , quite a good rugby player and a hell of a wine snob '			1
he chucked in his degree to work in a wine shop in @entity252 and by 22 he 'd been hired as wine buyer for @entity256 's @entity255 restaurant			1
the next year it won @entity306 in the country			0
he remains as enthusiastic today			0
' wine is an ever - changing subject			1
every 12 months , every wine made is in a bottle and trundling off into the world , and new versions are being made			0
' neither , it seems , does @entity3 .			1

@entity3 has been in the wine *industry* since his early twenties
he tastes 40,000 bottles of wine a year
this week 's weekend mag has a pull - out guide to the best 200 wines
