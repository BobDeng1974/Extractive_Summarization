it is known simply as the ‘ @entity1 ’			2
this is the wide open stretch of rugged @entity4 border where an average of seven @entity6 a week are crossing over to @entity7 and @entity8			1
it is the same route used by the @entity11 trio who appeared on a jihad recruitment video , a one - time rapper , a computer hacker and one - time privately educated college boy – all of whom are now at the centre of @entity6 investigations as they boast on @entity20 of their exploits			0
as the @entity23 witnessed , it is an alarmingly easy route to terror where border guards can turn a blind eye for as little as ten @entity27 dollars and an estimated 20 foreign recruits are travelling each day			1
the route is now dubbed the ' @entity32 ' or ' @entity1 ' smugglers and jihadists are able to breach the border seemingly at will with border guards turning a blind eye for 10 @entity27 dollars			1
an estimated 20 foreign recruits are travelling each day one shopkeeper in @entity40 , @entity4 , said one bearded man walked in waving $ 50,000 ( £ 30,000 ) in bundles of cash and bought a thousand ' magazine vests ' for carrying spare @entity46 rifle ammunition clips up to 1,000 @entity6 and @entity6 residents have now joined the extremists spreading terror across @entity7 and @entity8 – more than double as many as the government admits , according to security sources			1
disturbingly , intelligence agencies believe that the number of @entity6 recruits travelling through this alarmingly open ‘ gateway ’ to @entity57 strongholds of northern @entity7 is increasing since the self - proclaimed creation of a caliphate stretching from @entity7 to @entity8			1
it is no coincidence that virtually all the young radicalised @entity6 have joined up by crossing this porous , poorly policed @entity4 border of mountain passes and plains without confronting security			1
the route is now dubbed the ‘ @entity32 ’ or ‘ @entity1 ’			1
and crucially , it is from this border that up to 250 battle - hardened fighters are thought to have crossed on their return to the @entity6 , posing a huge threat to those in the @entity6 and a massive headache for the security services and police			1
the all - too - easy journey taken by home - grown fanatics from the @entity6 to the increasingly barbaric civil war begins with them arriving in @entity4 disguised often as @entity6 tourists enjoying a holiday			1
the frontier town @entity40 , a bombed - out staging post for hundreds of fighters , where shop owner @entity86 said @entity89 jihadis buy hunting knives , sniper rifle sights , binoculars and desert camouflage fatigues before their journey across the border an infrequent and ineffectual @entity4 @entity98 patrol along the porous border between @entity4 and @entity7 near the border town of @entity40 , one of the places @entity6 @entity103 cross with their brothers - in - arms to fight for @entity105 the well used track in the foreground leads to a river crossing and @entity7 beyond			1
at sunset , jihadis slip into @entity7 along the dusty trail , without ever encountering a border official like many of their fellow fighters , the three @entity11 school friends – gap - year student @entity118 , 20 , his brother @entity120 , 17 , and their friend @entity121 , 20 – are said to have jetted - in on a tourist fight to @entity123 , in southern @entity4 , after paying for a one - week stay at a five - star spa resort			1
they apparently vanished at 7am the day after checking in			0
an inspection of their room revealed two abandoned suitcases and a discarded beard trimmer			0
a taxi driver said they had asked the fare to @entity135 in eastern @entity4 , then taken a bus instead			0
a hotel source said @entity139 agents came to take their abandoned belongings			0
others simply use gleaming new @entity143 airport , built just ten miles from the @entity7 border			2
he masked man who killed @entity27 journalist @entity147 in a brutal propaganda video spoke with a @entity6 accent once in eastern @entity4 , @entity6 jihadis hook up with @entity57 handlers and embark on spending sprees in local army equipment shops			1
in frontier town @entity40 , a bombed - out staging post for hundreds of fighters , shop owner @entity86 said @entity89 jihadis buy hunting knives , sniper rifle sights , binoculars and desert camouflage fatigues			0
he said one bearded man walked in waving $ 50,000 ( £ 30,000 ) in bundles of cash and bought a thousand ‘ magazine vests ’ for carrying spare @entity46 rifle ammunition clips			0
at the nearby @entity170 , a busload of 30 @entity6 recently stayed on their way to @entity7 , the manager said			2
in another town on the tinderbox frontier , @entity176 , a smuggler called @entity173 said he drove five @entity6 dressed in @entity178 garb over the line by simply bribing a border guard with ‘ less than ten dollars ’			2
the @entity23 has witnessed just how easy the crossing is			0
on a dry , dusty track that is one of the ancient smuggling routes criss - crossing over the hills to @entity7 , there is nothing but scraps of broken barbed wire marking the border			2
the path leads down to the @entity193 river , which meanders through the valley of olive plantations , and on the other side is @entity7			0
a @entity4 army truck full of soldiers drove by			0
they barely glanced at a gaggle of smugglers from local villages who were busy carting oil drums and boxes of food and medicine down to the riverbank , to be pulled across on makeshift rafts			0
at sunset , jihadis slip into @entity7 the same way , without ever encountering a border official			2
similar scenes unfold at hundreds of unguarded points along a border that stretches 560 mountainous miles			0
the @entity11 trio who appeared on a jihad recruitment video - @entity121 , left , @entity220 , centre and @entity222 , right - all used the ' @entity1 to @entity32 ' @entity223 ( left ) and @entity224 are just two of the @entity6 nationals understood to be fighting in @entity7			1
up to 1,000 @entity6 residents and nationals have now joined the extremists former aspiring rapper @entity229 from @entity230 is among those thought to be fighting in @entity7			1
up to 250 fighters are thought to have used the ' @entity32 ' on their return route to @entity6 ‘ when they cross over , they kneel and cry , they weep , ’ said one smuggler			1
‘ they believe this land , @entity7 , is where @entity238 ’s judgment will come to pass			0
’ among those who have made it across is apparently a ‘ blond - haired , blue - eyed , @entity6 heart surgeon ’ running an is field hospital and going by the nom de guerre ‘ @entity243 ’			0
@entity245 , who fled the civil war to live in @entity4 , said : ‘ i went back to @entity7 because an @entity248 mother paid me to retrieve her dead son ’s body			2
near @entity251 , i met six @entity6 fighters and one of them was this white @entity6 doctor			2
’ he said the ‘ surgeon ’ told him he had abandoned a £ 120,000 - a - year job in the @entity255 and bought himself a top - of - the - range @entity46			0
keeping tabs on the fanatics is an uphill struggle for intelligence services			0
such is @entity57 ’s network of contacts and use of social media that recruits are told how to leave @entity6 – always travelling to @entity4 via other countries to avoid suspicion at @entity6 borders and using a variety of methods of travel – who to contact in @entity4 and which hotels and safe houses to use			1
the @entity274 in the @entity4 border town of @entity40 , one of the places @entity6 @entity103 stay with their brothers - in - arms , before being taken into neighbouring @entity7 to fight one of the @entity4 regional airports , this one at @entity280 , one of the places @entity6 jihadis are welcomed before crossing the border into @entity7 and beyond the bus station in the @entity4 border town of @entity176 , one of the places @entity6 @entity283 are welcomed - they often travel through other countries before arriving in @entity4 to throw security forces off their trail once in accommodation they make contact with a telephone number or email address and , usually , within 48 hours they are picked up and taken across the border to @entity57 training camps			1
in @entity143 province , which borders @entity7 , governor @entity299 dismisses all talk of foreign fighters as ‘ urban legends ’			2
but a leaked secret memo he wrote to his superiors , seen by the @entity23 , reveals the embarrassing truth that hundreds of fighters have been thumbing their noses at his border guards			1
his memo speaks in tones of panic , and says that , on march 15 this year for example , 150 armed men sneaked across the border , staying en - route at the @entity274 in @entity40			0
a people smuggler who claims to have taken @entity283 across the border from @entity176 in @entity4 into @entity7 to fight speaks to reporter @entity318 reporter @entity318 , pictured left near the lawless @entity4 border , discovered that the @entity320 used meeting points like the one pictured right to ensure recruits were swiftly taken across the border to @entity7 the @entity4 border town of @entity40 , where recruits are placed in in accommodation , where is fighters make contact with a telephone number or email address unofficial operations are on - going to track the militants in the border area , but @entity4 has been reluctant to stop anyone from crossing			1
for months they have allowed weapons and supplies destined for recognised @entity7 opposition groups to cross and @entity89 governments have been frustrated that little appears to have been done to stop the jihadis			2
a large force of jihadis is reported to be moving towards the border			0
their goal is to provide a guaranteed gateway through the 130 - mile frontier			0
if that happens , it will make the ‘ @entity32 ’ even simpler .			0

the ' @entity1 ' is along an open stretch of rugged @entity4 border
estimated 20 foreign recruits use it to cross into @entity7 and @entity8 every day
there , border guards turn a blind eye for as little as 10 @entity27 dollars
