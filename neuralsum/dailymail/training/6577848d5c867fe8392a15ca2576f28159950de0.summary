by @entity0 @entity1 : 18:00 est , 27 december 2013 @entity2 : 18:27 est , 27 december 2013 even when he was the new boy on the block at @entity7 , it did n’t take much to wind @entity8 up on the training ground			1
he played every game to win it			2
and the status and age of the player did n’t matter if he was n’t happy with you			2
you ’d know about it if you were on the receiving end of his tongue or one of his bad - tempered , x-rated challenges			2
@entity8 was often reprimanded for flying in during training matches but it was always a pleasure to see him in full anger mode			1
there are n’t many like him so he was a breath of fresh air			2
young star : @entity0 ( left ) was at @entity7 when @entity8 ( right ) made the breakthrough to the first team love him or hate him , he is at his best when he shows that little bit of devilment and passion , although there are times when he oversteps the mark and he does have to calm down			1
he should have been sent off at @entity37 recently and he could have been sent off at @entity38 on thursday if @entity39 had been stronger and more alert			2
there were times when he tried to bully the referee and , for such an influential and leading player , he has a responsibility to set a better example to young football fans			2
his manager also knows when he channels that anger into his football , no team can handle him and he wins matches for @entity53			2
they are still in this title race and it ’s mainly down to @entity8			1
lucky escape : @entity8 ( right ) was lucky to still be on the field when he kicked out at @entity37 's @entity60 in november volley good show : @entity8 leathers the ball into the net for his 150th @entity65 goal for @entity53 @entity67 obviously got a lot of positive signs in the summer that he was willing to leave @entity71 and they were prepared to pay big money make the transfer happen			1
there may have been a bit of mischief from @entity77 initially , but he knew what a difference @entity8 would make to the squad he inherited			1
but @entity81 had different ideas			1
and it ’s just as well			2
imagine @entity8 in the @entity67 team			1
they would be 10 points clear at the top of the table , title in the bag			2
@entity81 knew he had to do everything to keep one of his real stars out of the clutches of his main rivals			1
back together again : @entity81 handed @entity8 his @entity7 debut and convinced him to stay at @entity53 we all saw the devastating impact @entity100 ’s exit from @entity101 had on those two teams last season			1
and imagine @entity101 this season with a full fit @entity100 now			0
no @entity67 striker has scored away from home for more than a year and @entity8 has scored more goals than @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 combined			1
how he would have thrived from the service of @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 or @entity117			0
i am always reluctant to use the phrase ` one man team ’ and that would be unfair on other players in the @entity53 side this season who have performed , but @entity8 ’s performances remind me of @entity127 in the season @entity129 won the @entity130			1
hit and miss : @entity109 has failed to deliver the goals for @entity67 like he did at @entity129 misfiring : @entity8 has scored more goals for @entity53 this season than @entity134 ( left ) , @entity110 ( right ) and @entity109 combined this season he has inspired his team - mates and have dragged them through matches			1
they have lost one in the last nine , and that just happened to be at home to @entity141 , when @entity8 was suspended for reaching five bookings			1
@entity8 was not the same player last season			1
he was left out of key games , like the @entity130 clash with @entity148 , and his subsequent disagreement and unhappiness was with @entity151 , not his successor			0
my understanding is that the pair were reconciled after @entity8 left @entity7 for @entity71 but of course they did n’t have the benefit of working together to show that to everyone else			1
@entity81 had to wait until he took over from @entity151 to get that one - to - one contact and clearly had numerous meetings to convince @entity8 that he would be a key figure in his team			1
players will be sacrificed as the club goes through a rebuilding process but he has recognised @entity8 ’s talents and i think he will have been looking forward to working with him again , and getting the best out of him , after giving him his debut at @entity7 and helping to nurture him in those early days			1
issues : last season , under the management of sir @entity151 , @entity8 was left out of key games @entity8 has been playing in his favourite and most effective position , in the number 10 role , which also happens to be the number on his back			1
he is the perfect fit			0
he is one of those players who could genuinely play in every position , and he has an array of passes up there with the very best			0
but he has the most influence in that central area where he has the dynamic to use the freedom to create chances for others , and get behind the defence to score goals , or force defenders like @entity196 to put in their own net			0
he also showed at @entity38 that he can score goals outside the box			0
@entity38 took full advantage of @entity53 ’s poor start at the @entity202			2
the @entity53 bus was late , and the team looked like they were still sat in their seats for the first 10 minutes when they went two down			0
they conceded poor goals , and @entity8 was one of the guilty parties for @entity210 ’s opening goal			1
but when he has that devil working overtime , he has the ability to change matches			0
@entity38 found that to their cost , and plenty of others will in the title run - in			0
@entity220 is n't always the answer , just ask @entity222 @entity223 inevitably became the latest manager to lose his job on friday			1
@entity37 owner @entity226 is gambling with his club ’s @entity65 status by appointing a new manager at this crucial point of the season			1
if , as seems likely , he turns to @entity232 to keep the club up , he is employing a young coach with an excellent reputation , forged back in @entity236 , but with absolutely no experience of top flight management in @entity240 football			2
centre of attention : @entity223 has been sacked by @entity37 after days of speculation controversial : @entity37 owner @entity226 has courted controversy for his attitude towards @entity223 since the start of the season , several clubs have pushed the panic button and , in fairness , they have seen a positive response			1
@entity258 , for all the criticism of his style of play at @entity257 , took @entity259 out of the bottom three this week and he has undoubtedly made a difference to a team which looked doomed two months ago			0
@entity258 has never been relegated and gets results , even if it is n’t always pretty , by organising his team and playing to their strengths			0
the wins for @entity259 so far have been typical of the type he gained at @entity257			0
impact : @entity259 have improved under @entity258 ( left ) and @entity271 's goal was enough to beat @entity272 @entity273 was another manager who seemed to be harshly treated by @entity274			0
but @entity275 has found a way to get performances out of @entity278 , @entity279 and @entity280 and even @entity281 , before he was injured			0
improvement : @entity275 ( right ) has got the better performances out of @entity274 than @entity273 ( left ) did and although they remain bottom , there are signs of improvement at @entity288 too under @entity289			0
the win at @entity7 was arguably the best win in midweek			0
@entity288 looked solid and well organised at @entity291 and restricted the home side to long range efforts			0
massive goal : @entity295 of @entity288 scores the winning goal from the penalty spot against @entity7 at @entity291 while there are some positive signs at those clubs , sacking the manager and appointing a new man is not always guaranteed to bring success			2
would @entity222 be in the division they are in now if they had shown some loyalty and faith in @entity307 ? i doubt it			0
@entity310 moved into seventh this week as @entity307 continues to work his magic in the championship and prove once again he can get teams out of that division – at the right end			0
on the up : wolves are now in @entity319 but @entity307 is doing a superb job at @entity310 in the championship @entity322 have taken a similar path to their neighbours and are also on the brink of bringing in a foreign manager with no experience of the @entity65			1
@entity328 may have had a wretched record over the calendar year , but i suspect the @entity322 players would be more comfortable with the man they know			0
the board at @entity334 must be watching all this with great interest , particularly after slipping into the bottom three this week			1
and i just hope they are strong enough to stand by @entity338 and show the loyalty he needs			1
there is clearly some discontent among the owners about the @entity344 transfer			0
they need goals and he ’s not going to score them from the treatment room			2
@entity344 came with poor injury record and spending £ 16million on him was always going to be a gamble because managers are judged on their signings , as much as results			0
down the bottom : the absence of @entity344 ( left ) is increasing the pressure on @entity338 ( right ) the sooner he is fit , the better because @entity344 being unavailable is putting @entity338 under more pressure			1
but the funny thing is , if you were looking for a manager with experience and the know - how to keep a team up , you would n’t look much further than @entity338			1
i just hope @entity334 realise they have the right man in the job			2
thumbs - up @entity289 i made my @entity288 debut at @entity7 in 1999 , three years after they last won there			0
we lost 5 - 1			0
to go to @entity7 and end their record of remaining unbeaten at @entity291 in 2013 was a fantastic achievement by @entity288			0
they just have to do it more consistently to have any chance of survival			2
@entity288 manager @entity289 shakes hands with a young @entity288 fan at @entity291 where his side beat @entity7 1 - 0 thumbs - down @entity379 since when did the @entity129 defender take up @entity381 ? in the last two games , the @entity382 has been blatantly pulling opponents ’ shirts at set pieces and wrestling with them before the ball is anywhere near			0
it has been highlighted so much that he needs to cut it out or face the consequences of conceding penalties			0
reputation : @entity379 needs to stop blatantly pulling opponents ' shirts at set pieces			0

@entity81 *deserves* *praise* for making sure @entity8 stayed at @entity71
@entity226 is gambling with his club ’s @entity65 status by sacking @entity223
@entity338 will get @entity334 out of trouble if he is given the chance
