the reality star welcomed son @entity6 last week , weighing just 5 @entity7 , 2oz following an emergency caesearean in a foreign hospital			1
the 35 - year - old reportedly suffered from a potentially life - threatening infection which would harm her unborn child in her womb and @entity6 's heart rate fell worryingly low before she was forced to go into labour early			1
the baby â€™s heart rate was also really low			0
the next thing i know the nurse is in my room saying get ready now			0
' @entity29 , who she wed in march , was out shopping at the time and raced to be by her side once she 'd text him to tell him the news			2
but the nurses then banned him from coming into the theatre while she gave birth			1
@entity1 added to @entity40 : ' i was in a state			2
he 's never seen me like that before			0
he must have thought his wife had turned into a lunatic ... i was sobbing , " i love you , i love you "			0
' she also revealed the doctors only spoke broken @entity48 , adding to her hysteria : ' i was petrified but not one of the nurses came to hold my hand			1
' on the mend : @entity1 has since thanked her fans on @entity54 to keep them updated about the birth and her son trauma : @entity1 has revealed her nightmare birth after welcoming son @entity6 last week , weighing 5 lbs 2oz the glamour model has previously undergone two caesarians so was familiar with the procedure and worried why she had n't been given the usual first injection to numb the area			1
she tried to halt the doctor from cutting her but he went ahead and she felt the pressure			0
@entity6 has since been taken to a special care unit and is said to be ' doing well ' in the hospital but is still being monitored			1
although @entity1 was also faced with her newborn son being whisked away from her straight away , while she pleaded with them to fetch @entity29			2
she added : ' it felt so unfair because @entity29 and i did n't get that moment couples should share			2
but more importantly i did n't even know what my baby weighed or if he was ok			2
' difficult pregnancy : the model said her fourth pregnancy has been the most difficult @entity1 was discharged from the hospital on friday and is staying in a nearby villa while she visits the hospital in the day time			1
it is @entity1 's fourth child , her first with husband @entity84			1

it could be up to three weeks until he can be released from the hospital			1
the model has made no secret of the fact her current pregnancy has been her most difficult yet and she has gained more weight than when she carried her previous children			0
she wrote in her @entity40 column recently : ' i have n't got long to go now			0
i 've got a date and i know the sex but no one knows yet - and this time i 'm huge			0
' i 'm the biggest i 've been for all of my pregnancies			0
i 'm 11st already , whereas i was not even ten - and - a - half full - term with the others			0
' as well as weight gain , @entity1 has also been very uncomfortable , suffering from anaemia and low platelets			2
