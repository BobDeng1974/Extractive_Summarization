the conclusion of a football match , particularly monumental ones like the @entity4 final , often brings new debate and inquiry , questions about players , tactics and refereeing decisions			0
very rarely do they result in a government investigation			0
yet that is exactly what happened after @entity16 's capitulation in the 1998 final against hosts @entity18			1
quite what transpired in the hours before the match , particularly with star player @entity21 who was taken to hospital and left off the teamsheet only to be reinstated before kick - off , is one of football 's most enduring mysteries			1

the official records show the match ended in a 3 - 0 defeat for @entity16 but the story of what happened in and around the @entity18 that afternoon is murkier in detail			1
@entity21 , then just 21 , had been outstanding all tournament in a @entity16 side - including @entity53 , @entity56 and @entity61 - that were defending their title from 1994			1
the final was billed as a head - to - head between him and @entity18 's equally captivating talisman @entity46			1
in the event , the @entity18 midfielder steamrollered a jaded @entity16 outfit , scoring two first half headed goals in a man of the match performance with @entity45 adding a third after a late counter-attack			1

' he was scared about what lay ahead , ' he said , ' the pressure had got to him and he could n't stop crying			0
' to government congress later , @entity121 described a viscerally shocking scene as suddenly @entity21 started to have a fit			1
he frothed at the mouth and began to shake uncontrollably			1
@entity56 , overwhelmed by panic , started screaming for help			0
' when i saw what it was , i despaired , ' said @entity121 , ' because it was a really strong and shocking scene			0
' he ran through the hotel hitting on all the doors and shouting for everyone to come			0

at 6pm when the squad began the short coach journey to the @entity18 , @entity21 went to the @entity192 clinic in @entity118			1
his name was left off the teamsheets , sending the assembled international press into frenzy but 40 minutes before kick - off he arrived after being given the all - clear and insisted he should play			1
@entity16 's miserable showing on the pitch led to outrage in the country and rumours began to swirl about wrongdoing in the camp in the lead up to the match and even conspiracy			2
manager @entity65 was criticised for picking @entity21 despite what had happened but he defended his decision			1
' if you invert the situation and i did n't put @entity21 on and then @entity16 lost 3 - 0 , people would say ' @entity65 is stubborn , he had to put him on , @entity21 was the best player in the world			1

you can not disconnect from it			0
it 's a lot of pressure			0
but i pleaded with @entity65 to let me play			2
' @entity21 went on to lift the @entity4 with @entity16 in @entity253 four years later and will go down as one of the great strikers of all time , but an air of intrigue continues to hang over that afternoon 's events .			1
