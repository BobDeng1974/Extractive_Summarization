four frogs , 22 birds and 27 mammals have become extinct since @entity4 colonisation and now the @entity5 can be added to the list			1
the mouse - like creature has not been sighted since 2007 at the @entity10 's @entity9 on @entity4 's most northern tip. scientists appointed by @entity13 - the nation 's first threatened species commissioner - were also unable to find traces of it in the @entity10 's @entity9			1
the @entity18 , one of 27 mammals have become extinct since @entity4 colonisation the melomys was found only in four to five hectares of the area , and related to rats and mice , according to @entity24			1
@entity26 's conservation scientist @entity25 said @entity4 had the highest extinction rate in the world in the past 200 years for mammals			1
' it really affects critical weight range mammals who are smallish mammals , a bit like @entity5 , ' he told @entity34			2
' part of the reason why is they are ground dwelling mammals that are prey for exotic cats and foxes			2
those are the sorts of mammals that go extinct			1
' the @entity44 pipsterelle was the most recent animal to go extinct			1
the @entity46 , which is on the @entity48 list of extinct animals usually scientists wait at least 50 years before declaring an animal to be extinct			1
the @entity52 has a full list of extinct animals , including the @entity18 , @entity55 and the @entity46			2
but dr @entity25 said some of these extinct animals can be kept in captivity , while others do not exist on the mainland , they can still call an island home			2
for example , the @entity63 lived on the mainland until 4,000 years ago when the dingo was introduced and was confined to @entity67 before becoming extinct in the 1920s			2
dr @entity25 said more direct efforts to conserve endangered species needed to be ramped up , not just through funding , but legislation as well			0
' money is definitely an issue but it 's also how that money is applied			0
a lot of money is spent on ethical land care and natural resources management but not to obtain enduring change in the landscape , ' he said			0
@entity55 , last last seen alive in 1927			0
usually scientists wait at least 50 years before declaring an animal to be extinct			1
' first thing that could be done is protecting @entity86 threatened species			0
' we get $ 2 billion over five years so we should make sure this money is spent on enduring change and conservation			0
' the biggest and strongest thing to do is to protect species by buying buy a national park to protect [ where the species live ]			0
' but it 's not just money , we 've got legislation to stop land clearing , which has probably been far more effective than anything			0
' we see the government in @entity103 , for example , weakening that legislation and this is increasing the threat to native wildlife			0

the @entity110 is the latest animal that could be extinct
scientists have found no *evidence* the rodent is living at @entity10
@entity4 now has the highest mammal extinction rate in the world
four frogs , 22 birds and 27 mammals considered extinct in @entity4
