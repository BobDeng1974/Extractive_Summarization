by @entity0 it 's a race against time			0
more than 200 people have been employed by @entity4 surveying group @entity3 to get the job done as quickly as possible			1
they have a one - year deadline in which to find wreckage of the ill - fated @entity8 , before they will be forced to move on by the @entity10 ( @entity10 )			1
@entity3 must follow the lead provided by the @entity10			2
forming part of its contractual arrangements is that the current search site is to be analysed for a maximum of 12 months			0
‘ we know the time frame we have is about a year , after that we ’ll be working in a new box as provided by the @entity10 – they ’re always refining their data and if they decide before that it ( the plane wreckage ) may be further south or north , they can order us to move at any time , ' said @entity3 managing director , @entity29			1
‘ there ’s certainly no time to waste			0
' the images ( below ) of the search process which have been provided to @entity42 by @entity3 , give a sense of what the @entity4 team is up against			1
the @entity3 , which is 65 metres long , is highlighted by the small circle , dwarfed by the great expanses of the southern @entity48			1
it has just returned to the area after a crew change			0
in a setback for the operation , mr @entity51 said the sister ship , @entity54 , has had to be diverted via @entity55 and away from the @entity56 ' because we were worried about pirates , even though we went through the process of hardening the boat '			1
that included placing barbed wire right about @entity54 to try and prevent any potential hijacking			0
it should arrive in mid-september , about 10 days later than expected			1
' i ’ve got guys visiting factories all around the world looking for the necessary equipment to make this a success , ' mr @entity51 said			0
surveying crews are working against time to give a more accurate account of the sea - bed ahead of sensors being sent down			1
in some cases there will be a drop of 5000 metres but there are differences of up to 500 metres in some areas which need to be mapped before scanning equipment is sent down			0
using its advanced survey vessel , the @entity34 , fitted with state - of - the art multibeam echosounder equipment , @entity3 is conducting a bathymetric survey of the search area			1
the seabed data obtained will assist in the production of maps of the seabed off @entity91			2
@entity3 will spend more than $ 52 million in the next year in the search for @entity8			1
200 personnel will work on the project and are ' finding equipment from factories @entity97 ' mapping work continues in the area designated by the @entity10 , as @entity3 try to make the most of every possible minute			1
‘ they ( the @entity10 ) have done most of the research and determined the suitable box in which we should operate , ’ he said			0
that ‘ box ’ he refers to is in fact 60,000 square kilometres of the southern @entity48 , an area approximately the size of @entity108 , 1600 kilometres off the @entity91 coast			1
‘ we are looking for a debris field at the end of the day and we ’re basing it on a lot of methodology from previous searches , ’ mr @entity51 said			0
optimistically , he added that ‘ we expect to see a debris field ’			0
‘ we are also expecting , in a worst - case scenario , that we will see an engine because one of our proving tests shows that we can identify 2 metre by 2 metre cubed object			1
inside the control room on board the @entity34 where teams will monitor the progress of search equipment scouring the sea bed of the southern @entity48 for debris from @entity8 the @entity34 with a new crew on board is now on its way out to the southern @entity48 for a third mission searching for the wreckage of @entity8			1
@entity3 has 200 people working on the project , around the world ‘ we ’ll run over our proving range and start mowing the lawn , so to speak			2
that 's when we tow our sensors along the bottom			0
' that 's very difficult because of what is down there and part of why the @entity148 were unsuccessful - it 's very deep water we 're working in and there are variances of up to 500 metres or more in some places			2
‘ but our expectations coupled with the data we have gathered to date , is that it is sitting proud somewhere on the sea - bed			1
‘ i ’m not really sure how this will search will end up , it ’s a massive area about the size of @entity108 and the engine you could equate to the size of two big blokes – not an easy task			0
’ the search conducted by the @entity4 firm @entity3 will focus on a 60,000 square kilometre stretch of the @entity48 off the @entity55 coast @entity3 ceo @entity169 with a model of the two ships which are involved in the search for @entity8 the search operation will cost at least $ 52 million for the next 12 months			1
@entity175 's transport minister @entity174 will travel to @entity91 next week to meet with the search team and deputy prime minister @entity177			2
the @entity91 government has committed to spending up to $ 90 million on the @entity8 search operation			2
' we are working in conjunction with @entity175 government furnished assets , ' mr @entity51 said			0
initial analysis of radar data and satellite communication messages following the disappearance of @entity8 indicated it most likely crashed in the southern @entity48 , 2,500km south - west of @entity188			1
but despite an international search effort led by @entity91 and operated out of the @entity193 air force base in @entity188 , no debris from the plane has been found			2
troubled carrier @entity194 is set to be de-listed and made private as part of a major restructure following the twin disasters of @entity8 and @entity197 the first phase of the search for the missing plane was a surface search of probable impact areas , conducted by an international fleet of aircraft and ships , which concluded on april 28			2
an acoustic search , accompanied by a search of the ocean floor in the vicinity of the acoustic detentions was then conducted , also without success			0
the ocean floor search was completed on may 28			0
as part of a major restructure , the @entity175 government recently confirmed that the troubled airline will be de-listed and made private			0
significant job losses are expected			0
the overhaul comes after three unprofitable years and the double disasters of @entity8 and @entity197 .			0

' @entity34 ' returns to the southern @entity48 for its third mission
sister ship ' @entity222 ' has been diverted to avoid pirates
second vessel to arrive in mid-september , 10 days later than expected
new images show how @entity3 crews will conduct sea - bed search for @entity8
the @entity4 search team has confirmed it has ' one year ' to look inside its designated 60,000 square kilometre region before having to move on
*underwater* *vehicles* will search sea floor , 1600km off @entity91 coast
more than 200 personnel are now working on the project for the company
@entity3 officials believe the ' worst - case scenario is that we *'ll* find an engine '
@entity194 *passenger* plane , carrying *239* people , vanished in march
