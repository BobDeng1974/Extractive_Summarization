five years ago @entity0 was working as a secretary just outside @entity2 she lived in a humble one - bedroom apartment and when she was not typing letters and answering phone calls , she spent her time cooking and completing household chores			1
then late one night in 2008 she was awoken by a phone call at 4 o'clock in the morning			1
a royal red umbrella is lifted above her head to protect her from the sun on the other end of the line was her cousin , from @entity12 , a small fishing village on the coast of @entity20			0
and in that brief conversation on a warm summer 's night , the 55 - year - old was congratulated on being the new king of @entity12			1
' i said , " listen , it 's 4 o'clock in the morning in the @entity15 , i am very tired , let me sleep , " remembers @entity0			1
' i thought he was trying to really play games with me			0
' the previous king of the @entity46 village , who was @entity47 's uncle , has just passed away			1

@entity0 in her gold jewellery and crown on this morning with @entity61 as she tells her remarkable journey the king of @entity12 wears an unusual headdress and @entity46 dress after being told she has been appointed ruler @entity0 was no longer the same ordinary administrative assistant who had worked for nearly three decades at the @entity68 in the @entity15			1
@entity0 , who was interviewed by @entity69 , said : ' it never ever occurred to me [ that i 'd be @entity12 's king ]			1

for the one remaining month of the year she is called king ( the traditional title of @entity12 's ruler ) , and stands outs as a gold crown - wearing scepter - holding king who lives in a grand palace			0

happy day ! ' when she is there - and even when she is not - she works to improve the lives of her people			2
