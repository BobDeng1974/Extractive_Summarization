@entity0 emphatically overcame their curse at @entity2 with a 4 - 1 victory			1
an early goal from @entity5 gave @entity7 's side the lead but @entity9 equalised immediately before @entity10 put @entity0 ahead			1
defender @entity11 got the third before @entity9 found the net for his second			1
here 's how the players rated at the @entity16 : @entity2 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) @entity17 5.5 beaten four times but hard to blame him for what were a collection of brilliant finishes			1
@entity22 5.5 for a full back , he ’s actually quite enjoyable to watch and thinks nothing of dropping a shoulder and out - witting a winger at his own game			0
defensively he remains suspect and was caught cold for @entity9 ’s second			1
@entity29 6 @entity9 targeted @entity30 and that pays a compliment to @entity33 , who has been outstanding of late			1
he tried his best to organise against @entity0 ’s star - studded offence but that was a tough ask			1
@entity36 ( left ) had a difficult evening for @entity2 against @entity0 and @entity9 ( right ) @entity30 5 league debut for @entity2 and the last player he wanted to be facing was @entity9			1
he was skinned for the striker ’s equaliser and his rustiness showed against top - quality opponents			0
@entity44 5 has been in brilliant form since his free - transfer arrival last month but he found it tougher against @entity48 and struggled badly at times			0
@entity49 6 not as devastatingly disruptive as he was against @entity50 – although that would have been a tall order to repeat – but still got through his usual work with minimum fuss			0
@entity55 5.5 he huffs and puffs but does n’t really blow any defences down			0
puts a shift in nonetheless			0
@entity60 5.5 a little subdued and did not stamp his mark like sidekick @entity62			0
still struggling to make an impact since his £ 10m move from @entity0 in the summer			2
@entity60 struggled to impress for @entity2 against his former team at the @entity16 @entity67 7 enjoyed exploiting gaps in behind @entity0 ’s backline with cute passes early on and was at the heart of everything the hosts did offensively			1
@entity5 6.5 a touch of good fortune with opening goal but he deserved that for the endeavour which took him into the box			2
@entity5 ( centre ) put @entity2 into a surprise lead , but they could not hold on @entity83 6 tough task as lone man but he does it well and kept @entity0 ’s central defenders occupied in first half			1
subs @entity90 5.5 ( on 55 ) , @entity91 6 ( on 67 ) not used : @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 @entity0 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity97 6 very little to do and had little chance with goal			2
@entity11 7 recovered from his part in @entity2 ’s opener to put in typically robust display and his goal , dinking over @entity105 , was @entity106			1
@entity11 celebrates scoring @entity0 's third in the game against @entity2 @entity109 6.5 shaky start but found his rhythm and could now win a little run in the side			1
@entity114 6.5 the partnership with @entity116 took a little while to gel and , early on , looked like it might cost @entity0 dear as the hosts repeatedly slipped balls in behind their pair			2
but he steadied and cruised through the last hour			0
@entity123 6.5 kept @entity124 quiet and joined the attack as often as possible			0
was unlucky not to see one of his crosses converted			0
@entity129 6.5 again he never emerged from second gear and strolled through the contest			0
still , he hardly put a foot wrong			2
@entity133 7 a lot more energetic than @entity135 and saw a lot of the ball			0
@entity138 ( top ) skips over the challenge from @entity2 midfielder @entity49 @entity9 gave the @entity2 defence a torrid evening and scored two goals for his team @entity138 7.5 caused his full back all manner of problems and fizzed a string of balls through the box without any takers			1
@entity151 7 a killer through - ball for @entity11 ’s goal and enjoyed more space as game wore on			2
some delightful touches in and around the area			0
@entity10 6.5 an uncompromising finish to put @entity0 in front but was n’t involved a great deal and eventually made way			1
scored two – taking his tally for the season to 19 - and created one , winning applause from the home fans when he was replaced late on			2
he really is the best striker in world football right now			0
subs @entity172 6.5 ( on 55 ) , @entity173 6 ( on 74 ) , @entity174 ( on 84 ) not used : @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178			0

@entity5 put @entity2 into the lead after 19 minutes
but @entity9 equalised for @entity0 two minutes later
@entity9 got another and @entity11 and @entity10 also scored
