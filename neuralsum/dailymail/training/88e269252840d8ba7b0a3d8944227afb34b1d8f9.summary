but mr @entity7 was today forced to apologise for his ' grave error of judgement ' after it emerged that he had never served in the @entity45			1
instead , mr @entity7 admitted he had bought the medals off the internet before wearing them in public , including at @entity51 parades			1
he has now been forced to step down from the @entity52 of @entity53 and the @entity54 of @entity53			2
issuing an apology , mr @entity7 , who worked as a town crier in @entity23 , @entity14 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , said he had ' made a mistake '			1
he claimed the @entity34 medal was awarded to his late father @entity59 for taking part in the @entity61 and that he mistakenly believed he was entitled to wear it			1
he added that he wore the other medals as a ' tribute ' to former servicemen			2
he said : ' i was told several years ago that as the sole - surviving son i was entitled to wear the @entity34 and put @entity34 after my name			2
' tribute ' : the disgraced town crier claims the medals were worn to honour the @entity45 @entity72 used the title @entity34 after his name , which stands for @entity34 , pictured , and apparently wore the award as well ' i also wanted , with the anniversary of the @entity18 and @entity78 , to show my solidarity for those people who had served in these campaigns and found a place i could purchase replica medals and purchased a @entity16			1
' in september i contacted @entity84 on an unrelated matter and received a letter back asking when i had been awarded the @entity34			0
' i wrote back explaining the situation and was told that i had been misinformed and was in fact not allowed to use the title or wear the medal as it would lead people to assume that i had been awarded the medal , so i immediately removed all medals			0
' he added : ' i realise now that i made a grave error of judgement with this			2
' it was very stupid and i categorically now apologise to everybody who has served in the forces			0
it was never my intention to cause any distress or upset			0
' i made a mistake , i told someone i 'd served and it 's been going on from there			0
i ca n't apologise enough for the hurt and distress it has probably caused people			0
' people will probably feel , with hindsight , that i have misled them			0
i was in the wrong			0
i did not mean to offend anyone in the military - it was meant to be a show of support			0
mr @entity7 also used the title @entity34 - which stands for @entity34 - after his name on @entity40 's website ' it was never my intention to cause any distress but it has backfired and cost me everything			1
' mr @entity7 was exposed by a group calling itself the @entity125 , a group of former servicemen which investigates those who illegitimately wear medals			1

mr @entity7 wore the medals he acquired on the left			1
on their @entity140 page , @entity137 , @entity138 of @entity53 , said : ' we wish to thank the @entity125 for outing @entity7			2
' we wish to make it known that his actions are deplorable and beneath contempt			0
' he has resigned from all @entity53 positions , but rest assured , even if he had n't resigned , he would have been thrown out of our organisation in disgrace			0
' a month ago we investigated his wearing of medals , and he apologised profusely , saying it was a one - off , and we accepted his apology			0
however the fact he claimed the awards of @entity15 and @entity34 really is astounding			2
' @entity154 of @entity53 has immediately removed all trace of @entity7 from our websites			2
' to the many genuine @entity53 in the @entity158 and beyond , this will come as a huge shock , so , once again , well done sirs			0
' chairman of the @entity163 , @entity161 said : ' i saw mr @entity7 wearing the medals at @entity166 on his left breast and assumed they were his			1
' and a few years back he told me he had been in the @entity10			0
wearing the medals like this is an insult to the bravery of the troops who served			1
' i ca n't believe @entity7 was a pretender and i hope he can put this behind him			0
' in 2012 mr @entity7 , from @entity13 , in @entity14 , led @entity178 athletes to the spectacular opening ceremony for the @entity180			1
