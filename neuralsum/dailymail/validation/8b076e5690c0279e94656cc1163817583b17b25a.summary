@entity0 is not the sort to wash his dirty linen in public so for the @entity5 captain to launch a barely concealed attack on tuesday on the management who sacked him before the @entity10 is little short of astonishing			1
@entity0 's words in @entity13 , where he will play for @entity14 against @entity15 on sunday , will send shockwaves through an @entity5 hierarchy desperate to pick up the pieces from their disastrous @entity10 when they go to the @entity18 next month			1
not least , they will concern under - pressure coach @entity20 , who insisted in @entity21 that @entity0 was ' over ' his @entity10 omission but who must now wonder if his relationship with his @entity5 captain is seriously damaged			1
@entity5 one - day captain @entity0 was removed from his post in december last year @entity5 endured a disappointing @entity10 campaign and were eliminated at the group stage batsmen : ( @entity30 , @entity31 ) @entity0 , 30 , 109 , @entity32 @entity33 , 25 , 14 , @entity15 @entity34 , 25 , 8 , @entity15 @entity35 , 32 , 105 , @entity36 @entity37 , 24 , 3 , @entity38 @entity39 , 27 , 0 , @entity15 @entity40 , 24 , 22 , @entity15 @entity41 , 33 , 49 , @entity36 all - rounders : @entity43 , 27 , 0 , @entity15 @entity44 , 23 , 6 , @entity45 bowlers : @entity47 , 32 , 99 , @entity38 @entity48 , 28 , 74 , @entity49 @entity50 , 26 , 5 , @entity51 @entity52 , 29 , 13 , @entity15 @entity53 , 33 , 1 , @entity54 @entity55 , 25 , 0 , @entity45 @entity0 made no attempt to hide the hurt he has felt back home on his @entity60 farm while @entity5 floundered so badly under his replacement @entity61 that they could not even make the last eight			1
' i think you saw in @entity21 the dangers of making such a big decision so close to a tournament , ' said @entity0 of his sacking on the brink of the @entity10			1
' i do n't know what 's gone on over there , and i can only speak from watching a little bit from afar , but it did look like the lads were shell - shocked from the first two games			2
that 's when you need real leadership to steer you through that			2
' i ca n't speak about what 's gone on in depth but you always back yourself and i would have loved to have had the opportunity that was taken from me			2
the selectors made that decision because they thought it was best for @entity87 cricket			0
hindsight has probably proved them wrong but now it 's easy to say that			2
' whether i would have made a difference i do n't know , but i was confident we would get out of the group			0
from there you just have to win three games in a row — that 's how this @entity10 has worked			1
what a mess @entity5 find themselves in			2
they made decent progress in test cricket last summer but that has been virtually invalidated by the crushing inadequacy of the @entity10 squad — and @entity0 knows it			1
@entity0 believes hindsight has proved the @entity107 wrong to remove him as captain before the tournament ' the test team was in a good place , ' said @entity0			1
' i would n't say all the confidence has gone but a hell of a lot of it has			0
it 's a different format but all teams are grouped under the same @entity87 umbrella and we ca n't be naive enough to think that they 're not			0
' we have a repair job to do and the only way of doing that is by playing some good cricket and starting to win			0
we built that momentum a little bit after the @entity128 14 or 15 months ago with a younger side , including the likes of @entity40 and @entity34			0
' there was a feelgood factor about the @entity87 game in the middle of august after the @entity135			0
since then it 's been tough going			0
we 've got to rebuild again			0
' @entity0 ( right ) feels @entity5 have to rebuild the feelgood factor that followed @entity135 success against @entity139 @entity0 ( left ) will lead @entity5 in three tests in the @entity141 in april , before @entity143 visit in may @entity0 feels the @entity107 have highlighted the perils of changing captain so close to an international tournament @entity61 's @entity5 captaincy came under particular scrutiny during the poor @entity10 performance @entity0 did not mention @entity61 by name but there is little doubt that he proved a desperate disappointment as @entity5 's one - day replacement captain			1
not only was he unable to regain the form that has largely deserted him over the past year but @entity61 was not the adventurous tactician many imagined him to be			0
the @entity157 also spoke such gibberish in public that he ended up saying he had ' no regrets ' over the worst @entity10 in @entity5 's history			1
whether he retains the one - day leadership remains to be seen but he has done himself few favours by insisting he will miss @entity5 's next one - day international against his native @entity164 in @entity165 so that he can play in the @entity166			1
@entity0 may not have been able to arrest his own slump in form before the @entity10 but history will now say that @entity5 did not improve by ditching him after backing him as one - day captain for three and a half years			1
now attention is back on @entity0 for a three - @entity5 tour of the @entity141 next month that is crucial if @entity20 — along with managing director @entity173 and national selector @entity174 — are to keep their jobs until this summer 's ashes			1
at least @entity0 had some encouragement for the coach			2
' there 's pressure on him , ' said @entity0			1
' there 's pressure on all of us			0
all i can say is that i 've really enjoyed working with @entity20			0
he 's a fantastic coach who just needs a bit of luck			0
i hope he gets the opportunity to stay and turn things around			0
' @entity190 will get that chance in the @entity18 unless new chairman @entity192 and new chief executive @entity193 swing the axe in their first weeks in office			0
they will probably give all involved a little longer but patience is short and now @entity5 know that they also have a disaffected @entity5 leader despite investing so much in him			2
it is a sorry state of affairs and one that can only be transformed by good results			0
@entity0 ( left ) was struggling for runs in one - day cricket when the @entity107 decided to remove him as captain @entity0 believes that @entity5 would have made it out of their group at the @entity10 if he had been there			1

@entity0 was sacked as @entity5 one - day captain in december
@entity5 fell to an *embarrassing* group stage elimination at the @entity10
@entity0 believes that the side 's confidence has been *shattered* as a result
