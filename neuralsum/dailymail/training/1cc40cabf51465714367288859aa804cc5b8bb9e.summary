by @entity0 a public kiss between two men could be defined as illegal ' homosexual propaganda ' and bring a fine of up to £ 10,000 if a bill that comes up for a first vote this month becomes law in @entity8			1
the legislation being pushed by the @entity10 and the @entity11 would make it illegal to tell minors information that is defined as ‘ propaganda of sodomy , lesbianism , bisexuality and transgenderism			2
’ it includes a ban on holding public events that promote gay rights			2
the @entity11 in @entity8 has demanded a national referendum on criminalising gay relationships in a move certain to deepen conflict with the @entity27			1
picuttured : officers detain gay right activists during a protest in @entity31 the bill is part of an effort to promote traditional @entity8 values as opposed to @entity27 liberalism , which the @entity10 and church see as corrupting @entity8 youth and contributing to a wave of protest against president @entity43 's rule , @entity32 reported			1
other laws that the @entity10 says are intended to protect young @entity8 have been adopted in recent months , including some that allow banning and blocking web content and print publications that are deemed ‘ extremist ’ or unfit for young audiences			1
@entity51 , a sociologist with the @entity52 , an independent pollster , says the anti-gay bill fits the ‘ general logic ’ of a government intent on limiting various rights			0
but in this case , the move has been met mostly with either indifference or open enthusiasm by average @entity8			1
protest : @entity8 police officers detain a gay rights activist during an attempt to hold a gay pride parade in @entity31 in may 2012 @entity52 polls conducted last year show that almost two thirds of @entity8 find homosexuality ‘ morally unacceptable and worth condemning			1
’ about half are against gay rallies and same - sex marriage ; almost a third think homosexuality is the result of ‘ a sickness or a psychological trauma , ’ the @entity52 surveys show			1
@entity8 's widespread hostility to homosexuality is shared by the political and religious elite			1
lawmakers have accused homosexuals of decreasing @entity8 's already low birth rates and said they should be barred from government jobs , undergo forced medical treatment or be exiled			1

an executive with a government - run television network said in a nationally televised talk show that homosexuals should be stopped from donating blood , sperm and organs for transplants , while after death their hearts should be burned or buried			0
the anti-gay sentiment was seen sunday in @entity105 , a city south of @entity31 , where a handful of gay activists protesting against the parliament bill were attacked by a much larger group of anti-gay activists who hit them with snowballs			0
a man dressed in a bridal gown screams out of a police vehicle after he was detained in a gay rights protest in december , @entity116 , founder of gay - rights group the @entity118 , was pelted with eggs by militant activists with the @entity11 seconds after he and his boyfriend kissed			0
he was arrested by police , fined £ 10 and detained for 30 hours first in a frozen van and then in an unheated detention centre			0
the @entity11 activists were also rounded up , but were released much earlier			0
those behind the bill say minors need to be protected from ‘ homosexual propaganda ’ because they are unable to evaluate the information critically			0
the bill reads : ‘ this propaganda goes through the mass media and public events that propagate homosexuality as normal behavior '			2
@entity8 cities started adopting anti-gay laws in 2006			1

in november , a @entity143 court dismissed a lawsuit filed by the @entity146 , a small group of @entity11 conservatives and @entity43 loyalists , against pop star @entity149			0
the group sought £ 6.7million in damages for what it says was ‘ propaganda of perversion ’ when @entity149 spoke up for gay rights during a show three months earlier			0
the federal bill 's expected adoption comes 20 years after a stalinist - era law punishing homosexuality with up to five years in prison was removed from @entity8 's penal code as part of the democratic reforms that followed the @entity166 's collapse			1
