by @entity1 reporter published : 01:55 est , 4 december 2013 updated : 03:29 est , 4 december 2013 for years , doctors have been treating @entity4 patients using anti-viral drugs , the effects of which can sometimes be mixed			2
now a group of scientists in @entity9 have tried seeing if using powerful doses of radiation - a radioactive smart bomb - might be more effective , and the results are very encouraging			0
researchers found that in patients who were blasted with a combination of antiviral drugs and radiation , the treatment was even more effective and made the hiv virus became undetectable in the body			1
cell with @entity21 : nearly nine million adults worldwide live with @entity4 receive antiretroviral therapy which keeps the virus from multiplying by killing the virus in the bloodstream , but it does not completely eliminate the @entity4 - infected cells dr. @entity29 , @entity30 , from the @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity9 is behind this pioneering research which investigated the ability of radioimmunotherapy to kill white blood cells infected with @entity4			1
the radio active antibodies were also able to kill significantly more hiv - infected cells in the brain whilst doing less damage to the brains delicate systems			2
' antiretroviral treatment only partially penetrates the blood brain barrier , which means that even if a patient is free of @entity4 systemically , the virus is still able to rage on in the brain , causing cognitive disorders and mental decline , ' dr @entity29 said in a statement			0
' our study showed that radioimmunotherapy is able to kill @entity4 - infected cells both systemically and within the central nervous system			1
' combo : @entity29 , professor of radiology , microbiology and immunology at @entity31 in the @entity32 , believes the combination of antiviral drugs and radiation could be the answer to cure after 30 years of fighting the deadly and incurable virus , scientists think they may be able to find a way to really kill it			1
earlier this week the @entity68 and the @entity69 announced a new , $ 100 million effort to try to find a cure			0
in the latest study , researchers tested a modified version of a therapy now used to treat leukemia on blood taken from 15 patients with @entity4 , and found evidence it could clean out infected cells			1
these so - called latent cells are the main reason that @entity4 can not be cured – they lie low in the body , quietly resting until drug treatment stops , and then roar back into action			1
the team tried the new technique on 15 patients being treated for @entity4			0
it killed the infected cells that were still circulating in the patients , and even penetrated into the brain – something that not many drugs can do			2
“ the elimination of @entity4 - infected cells with @entity98 was profound and specific , ” dr. @entity29 said			1
“ the radionuclide we used delivered radiation only to @entity4 - infected cells without damaging nearby cells			1
” the human immunodeficiency virus that causes @entity104 infects 35 million people globally and has killed another 36 million , according to the @entity106			0
there ’s no cure and experimental vaccines work only poorly			0
@entity4 infection : new findings show that radioimmunotherapy ( @entity98 ) could potentially eradicate @entity4 - infected cells in a similar method to how cancer is treated drug treatment called antiretroviral therapy can keep the virus suppressed to such low levels that patients are healthy and much less likely to infect others			1
however , the virus always seems to remain in the body somewhere , and if the drug treatment is stopped , the cells usually start pumping out more virus again			0
reservoirs of latently infected cells persist in the body , preventing the possibility of a permanent cure			2
in a few extremely rare cases , patients appear to have been cured			0
@entity98 , which has historically been employed to treat cancer , uses monoclonal antibodies - cloned cells that are recruited by the immune system to identify and neutralize antigens			2
on route to a cure : a large red ribbon hangs at the @entity138 of the @entity68 , for @entity139			0
the red ribbon is worldwide regarded the symbol of solidarity with @entity4 - infected and those suffering from @entity104 antigens are foreign objects like bacteria and viruses that stimulate an immune response in the body			1
the antibody , designed to recognize and bind to a specific cell antigen , is paired with a radioactive isotope			0
when injected into the patient ’s bloodstream , the laboratory - developed antibody travels to the target cell where the radiation is then delivered			0
“ in @entity98 , the antibodies bind to the infected cells and kill them by radiation , ” dr. @entity29 said			2
“ when @entity161 and @entity98 are used together , they kill the virus and the infected cells , respectively			0
” ' we found that radioimmunotherapy could kill @entity4 - infected cells both in blood samples that received antiretroviral treatment and within the central nervous system , demonstrating @entity98 offers real potential for being developed into an @entity4 cure , ' because the study was only conducted in blood samples and lab models , researchers say the next step is to test the treatment in clinical trials with humans .			1

antiviral drugs are usually used to treat @entity4 and @entity104 but radiation could make treatment even more effective
radiation treatment similar to that used to treat cancer appears to remove the body of @entity4 infected cells
combination of radiation and antiviral *medication* may be the answer
trials have proved *successful* in mice and in the blood samples of 15 people who were already receiving treatment for @entity4
clinical trials would be the next step
