by @entity0 published : 05:02 est , 7 june 2012 updated : 02:03 est , 4 july 2012 setting up in a new home can be fraught with pitfalls , but this plucky seagull has chosen a risky nesting place by any standards			0
the foolhardy bird opted for a spot with excellent transport links - after setting up its home inches away from a busy railway line at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13			1
the seagull 's daring new home has become the source of much amusement with train passengers , who can see the bird sitting on its eggs on the side of the track as carriages pass by			1
unruffled : the bird continues to look unconcerned even as the wheels of a large train carriage pass directly next to its home cutting it fine : the seagull appears unruffled by a train steaming past as it sits near its nest in @entity12 , @entity13			1
home sweet home : the seagull and its unusual choice of nesting spot has become a hit with train passengers in @entity13 retired senior manager @entity38 was one of those who took pictures of the nest while on holiday with his wife			1
mr @entity38 , 69 , from @entity44 , near @entity45 , said : ' when we arrived at the station we spotted the nest next to an adjacent track with the bird sitting on top			2
' i snapped some photos but it was cold and rainy so we went to a pub for a few hours to warm up			0
' when we returned the gull was still dutifully warming its eggs and there were a group of passengers taking photos			2
' it was incredible and i have never seen anything like it before			0
the train sped past and it did n’t flinch			0
dicing with death : the seagull sits carefully on its eggs , apparently indifferent to the danger of the track next to its head despite the bird caring for its young next the railway , passengers have expressed concern that the chicks could hatch and find their way on to the track ' i think what happened was the rail line has only recently started operating for the summer , so when the bird built its nest there were no trains around			1
' i ’ve been an amateur bird watcher and in my experience birds are not too bothered about the presence of a machine , it ’s people they are more worried about			0
' @entity38 added : ' my only concern is when the eggs hatch , which will be soon , the youngsters will be crawling about and could find their way onto the track			2
' but it ’s very difficult to move a nest because you can spook the parents and they may not come back			0

brave bird nests inches from railway line in @entity12 , @entity13
train passengers fear its chicks may *wander* onto track when they hatch
