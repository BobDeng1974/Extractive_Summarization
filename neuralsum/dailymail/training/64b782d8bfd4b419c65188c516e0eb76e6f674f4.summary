taronga zoo koala keeper @entity13 told @entity14 it was one of the most surprising scenes she had seen in five years on the job			0
the first 36 hours with @entity11 were a bit of a rough start , since @entity9 was determined to prove himself as the boss , ’ she said			1
two - year - old @entity9 was only recently introduced to the closure , which is usually an aggressive period			1
‘ there was a bit of bellowing and tussling for dominance			2
but it was smooth sailing from then on			0
’ within 10 days , when the images were taken , @entity9 and @entity11 were getting along like a house on fire			1
‘ it means they have accepted their hierarchy			0
they feel comfortable in one another 's confines , ’ @entity38 said			1

there is no way you would find this with fully grown adults			0
