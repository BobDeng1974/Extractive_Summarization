by @entity0 published : 20:40 est , 30 march 2013 updated : 20:41 est , 30 march 2013 @entity1 has no need for an alarm clock to wake her three children for school			1
the daily dawn chorus in her tower block apartment in downtown @entity8 is the thump of rockets fired from @entity12 army artillery batteries in the hills surrounding the country 's capital or the roar of government @entity18 fighter jets overhead			1
@entity19 - born @entity1 is trapped in a war zone			1
the teacher ca n't leave because she needs the written permission of her estranged @entity12 husband to take her two younger sons , @entity25 , 11 , and @entity26 , ten , out of the country			1
he is currently living in exile in @entity30 and does n't reply to her letters			1
' some days are worse than others , ' says @entity1 , 51			1
' i 'll feel trapped and scared by the bombing going on around me , but then the next day , the situation quietens			1
' trapped : @entity1 with sons @entity37 19 , @entity38 , 10 , and @entity39 , 11 as we speak , another salvo of rockets fires out from the hilltop			1
the noise appears not to faze her children – her oldest son , from her first marriage , is 19 - year - old @entity37			1
but @entity1 is clearly rattled			1
the @entity49 says at least 70,000 people have been killed since protests against president @entity52 began two years ago			1
in the past few days , 15 students died at the university after a mortar strike and ten shells have exploded within half a mile of @entity1 's office during heavy fighting in the capital			1
she has lost two close friends to the conflict , one to a bomb and one to a sniper bullet			1
at least a dozen of her former students have been killed			1
' i fret and cry daily about our safety and the lack of money , ' she admits			1
' every time a child is late home , i think they have been killed or held at one of the military checkpoints as they cross town to school			1
bloody conflict : a masked @entity81 fighter smokes during heavy fighting in the @entity84 neighbourhood of @entity8 ' i 've friends who say it 'll all be over in two months but they 've been saying that for two years			1
others think it 'll be like @entity89 , and that went on for eight years , or @entity91 – six years			1
my feeling is it 's a stalemate because both sides have so much outside support			1
i think the war will go on for at least another five or six years			1
' the violence all around is the new normal in @entity8			1
' yesterday , a small truck suicide bomb went off within 200 metres of the park my children were playing in , ' she adds			1
' @entity25 told me , '' mum , it was like an earthquake			1
'' ' she speaks with only a hint of a @entity107 brogue after years of living in @entity108 – where she worked as a dental hygienist and then as sales manager for a medical finance company – and almost a decade in @entity12			1
brought up a @entity112 , she was educated at the £ 10,000 - a - year @entity113 of @entity19 and currently teaches @entity114 to businessmen and students at the @entity117 in the tax - free business zone , across the city in @entity8			1
her daily journey involves lengthy detours on foot to avoid the checkpoints , where one false move can see you arrested , roughed up or worse			2
' i 'm more worried about @entity37 when it comes to the checkpoints , ' she says			2
' at 19 , he is rebel fighting age and a target for checks			2
he has to show his papers every time			2
but as soon as he shows his @entity135 passport , he flies through “ go go go ! go quickly ! ” they tell him			2
' @entity37 says the official @entity12 army checkpoints present no problems			2
instead , he fears the unpredictable , untrained rebel forces			2
' the biggest threat for me are definitely the free army , ' he says			2
' i hate it all			2
in truth i 'm a complete pacifist			2
i do n't want to see any weapons in this world			2
' @entity1 's three boys are a credit to her			1
' they sometimes calm me down when i leap up hearing an explosion , ' she says			2
' they say , “ calm down , mum – it 's just the rebels or the government farting			2
” to them it 's normal now			2
i 'm so sad about the situation here , i cry every day			2
the people are incredible , so friendly , so helpful			2
civil war : flames and smoke billow from burned cars after two bombs exploded at @entity165 , @entity8 we 'd all cry if we had to leave – and we may have to once we can			1
but at the moment we 're stuck here because my two younger boys ' father is @entity12			2
they have a well - known @entity172 surname			1
i need power of attorney from their father to get their passports stamped to leave the country			2
' she does not know where he is living in @entity30			1
now , though , she has discovered he is wanted by @entity12 police for alleged non-repayment of government loans connected with his academic studies in @entity135			2
because of that , she now hopes divorce might be possible in a matter of months			0
@entity1 's story is as tangled as it is sad			1
after her first marriage collapsed , she converted to @entity194 in @entity135 , but was targeted by a fundamentalist sect , the @entity196 , who put pressure on her to marry an adherent			0
she has now renounced the @entity196 and holds moderate views			0
' the pressure never let up and i eventually married my husband after meeting him for three hours – as @entity196 rules dictate			1
i made a premarital verbal agreement that we would live in his home country			0
he promised he would finish his phd in six months and we would move to @entity12			0
uprising : the @entity49 says at least 70,000 people have been killed since protests against president @entity52 began two years ago ' but i then discovered he was in danger of deportation			0
i had to apply for a visa so he could continue his studies			0
four years later , he still had not completed his phd and we were still in the @entity135			0
apart from two short periods of maternity leave , i supported the family almost unaided			0
if he gave me money for the weekly shop , it was never more than £ 50			0
' i sold my home in @entity228 , @entity108 , and bought a new property in @entity230			0
he began work to extend it , but the money ran out			0
he used up my overdraft and suggested borrowing money to complete the home and then move to @entity12			0
' he was supposed to pay the monthly payments , but never did			0
' i moved to @entity12 in 2004 with £ 15,000 , leaving £ 10,000 with him to finish the work – which was not done			0
i 'm not even sure if all the windows are in place			0
i do n't even have the keys			0
' i brought the boys to @entity12 , and hired part - time help in my home and went to work teaching @entity114			1
then , in 2006 , his friend came and took the remaining £ 1,000 back for him			0
he visited us perhaps for less than 50 days in the years between 2004 and 2010 , when i last saw him			0
' my husband is now wanted in @entity12 for taking money from the university to study for his doctorate , then never completing it and not returning to work at the university to fulfil his contract			1
i am trying to use that to gain a divorce			0
' meantime , she struggles to feed her sons in a country ravaged by the conflict and by the inflationary effects of international sanctions and profiteering			1
' my rent has gone up 30 per cent in six months			0
bread and gas cylinders for cooling and heating – it 's all three , four , five times more expensive than before the war			1
' rebels : free @entity81 fighters take their positions at the front line of @entity277 she has no choice but to work long hours , teaching @entity114 for 12 hours most days			0
the boys make their own sandwiches before going to school			0
' i 've no choice but to work long hours just to stay above water			0
i can earn decent money for @entity12 and still i 'm really struggling			0
so what about the 80 - odd per cent of people who earn less than me ? how are they coping ? ' i worry and cry daily about not having enough money to live			1
the sanctions are killing as many people here as the fighting			0
' the exchange rate used to be 47 @entity12 lira to the @entity298 dollar – now it 's about 120 lira			0
a bottle of @entity302 gas for cooking that used to cost 240 lira this week cost me 2,400 lira			0
fierce fighting : a @entity12 military tank shells a neighborhood in @entity8 this week ' we lived the whole winter with no diesel fuel to fill the heater and we had severe cold and snow			0
and there are power cuts often , up to three times daily for about three hours each			0
during the snow , the power was off for more than 36 hours			0
' ' you need money to leave			0
where would i store our belongings or do i just abandon everything ? how could i move back to @entity135 , where i have no savings ? would i find a job ? i 'm terrified of not having enough money to feed my children – or even that i might lose my children because of this			0
' there has been no @entity135 embassy in @entity8 since 2011			0
even then , diplomats told her she was on her own			0
so she sits tight in the warren of concrete apartment blocks , listens for rockets , mortars and migs and worries about her children and their future			0
