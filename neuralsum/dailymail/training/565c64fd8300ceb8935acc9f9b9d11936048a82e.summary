an aid worker battling the deadly and fast - spreading ebola virus in @entity2 said the area is completely unprepared to deal with the crisis			2
@entity5 , originally from @entity6 in @entity7 , has been living in @entity8 for the past two years and has seen first hand the devastation the disease is causing			1
' it 's chaos ' , she told @entity14			0
' they 're totally under - resourced			1
' ' patients are getting left in their houses because we just do n't have any room			0
' @entity6 woman @entity5 has been working in @entity8 for two years , and more recently has seen the devastating effect the @entity23 outbreak is having on the region in the capital city , @entity26 , there are only 30 beds available to those with @entity23 , despite there being thousands of people infected or suspected to have contracted the potentially fatal virus			1
' they 're just waiting for people to die to free up the beds , ' ms @entity32 said			0
ms @entity32 originally moved to @entity26 to work on the women and children 's health policy , but when @entity23 began to spread received a direct request from the minister of health in @entity8 to help fight the disease			1
but she believed the only real way to contain the virus was if @entity7 and other nations sent expert military medical teams to set up field hospitals and isolation centres , two things which @entity26 need so desperately			1
' the only way we have a chance of containing this outbreak is if we deploy military ' , ms @entity32 said before adding that they would be able to accommodate a level of risk humanitarian aid ca n't			0
the aid worker has started a petition which has already garnered over 33,000 signatures , urging foreign minister @entity60 to do more than financially support the situation			0
the disease is spreading fast without the appropriate resources to contain those infected @entity5 ( centre ) seen here at the christening of her god - daughter , said it is impossible to contain @entity23 without expert military medical teams from @entity7 , the @entity71 and the @entity72 ' i 've never been more devastated in my life			1
last week i returned to @entity6 after working with the health ministry in @entity8 – witnessing first hand how the deadly ebola virus is spiralling out of control and killing hundreds			1
' ' it 's terrifying , and to be honest i 'm not sure anyone knows when or how it 'll end			0
what i saw will stay with me forever – in some places there are n't enough ambulances to pick up those infected or bury the dead , ' ms @entity32 wrote on @entity89			0
just last week there was a direct request made by the government in @entity8 to prime minister @entity93			1
ms @entity32 said she believes there is hesitation in sending personnel overseas as there is a risk of infection			0
the reality is less than ten aid workers have contracted @entity23 , and if isolation facilities were set up alongside @entity72 and the @entity71 in @entity2 treatment would be incredibly easy			1
ms @entity32 also revealed the wider devastation the spread of @entity23 was having on the community , economy , and already struggling healthcare system			1
in @entity8 there are only 30 beds available for @entity23 patients , so hundreds more are forced to stay at home until people die and free up space in the hospitals ms @entity32 ( centre ) celebrated @entity7 day with fellow countrymen in @entity26 this year people are terrified to visit hospitals , which is having devastating effects on the number of people accessing the health facilites , a problem the region has already been battling with for years			1
' pregnant ladies are giving birth at home , if your baby has malaria you do n't take them to the hospital ' , ms @entity32 revealed			0
' the hospitals are empty beside @entity23 patients			2
' she also told of how tough the struggle was to break down the stigma around accessing healthcare services , and how the disease is quickly unravelling all the hard work			2
one in eight women died during childbirth before the government introduced free healthcare for pregnant women			0
this is worst outbreak of @entity23 the region has ever seen , and the first time it has appeared in such an urban and highly populated area			2
the country 's government burial team is seen here carrying the coffin of dr @entity153 , @entity8 's second senior physician to die of @entity23 fellow @entity154 @entity155 ( left ) and @entity71 doctor @entity156 have been fighting alongside ms @entity32 ( centre ) to keep @entity26 's main isolation centre open if it is not contained soon , the projection is grim			1
authorities believe it could spread to more than 1.4 million people across the region if urgent and desperately needed help is not received			0
the reason the virus is spreading so quickly is the close communities without standalone houses and the close proximity of marketplaces with many people packed into them allow it to spread with much greater ease			0
' we do n't have that level of contact in @entity7 ... ( and ) we 've got the medical expertise to be able to put in place the correct procedures ' , ms @entity32 said when asked if @entity23 could post a threat to her home country			1
despite the devastating health implications , the aid worker insisted there is much more at stake than the terrible loss of life			2
ms @entity32 ran the @entity8 marathon last year with her mum there to show her support already unstable economies in the region are likely to crumble under the pressure , and this process has already begun already unstable economies in the region are likely to crumble under the pressure , and this process has already begun			1

' the disease has already claimed hundreds of lives in countries in the area , and could claim many more if urgent action is not taken , ms @entity32 warned			2
' it can definitely be contained ... if we have beds for suspected or confirmed patients , healthworkers who are able to treat them			0
' unless we have those two things on the ground we do n't stand a chance			0
