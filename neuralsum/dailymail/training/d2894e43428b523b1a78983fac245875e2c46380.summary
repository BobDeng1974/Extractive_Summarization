@entity0 and @entity1 would have needed to convert another 13 spot - kicks to break the world record for the highest - scoring penalty shootout on tuesday night			1
the shoot - out at the end of their @entity8 third round tie at @entity9 was epic enough with its 27 goals and 30 penalties in total			0
but it fell some way short of the highest - scoring shootout , which was @entity16 ' 20 - 19 win over @entity17 in november 1988 , back when all drawn matches in the @entity19 went to penalties			1
@entity0 's players celebrate after their epic 14 - 13 penalty shootout victory over @entity1 @entity1 's @entity23 was the unfortunate one to miss the decisive penalty - the 30th kick of the shootout @entity0 goalkeeper @entity27 converts his penalty as the whole team gets a go and it was also nowhere near the record for the longest shootout , as recognised by the @entity34 , which was the 48 kicks taken by @entity36 and @entity37 in the 2005 @entity39 cup final			1
incredibly , 15 kicks were missed that day as @entity36 held their nerve to win 17 - 16			0
the incredible events at @entity9 did however eclipse the previous @entity8 shootout record of 9 - 8 , which has happened on three occasions : @entity45 vs @entity46 in 2004 and @entity47 vs @entity48 and @entity49 vs @entity50 in 1982			2
it equalled the record between two professional @entity54 clubs - the september 2011 @entity56 tie that ended @entity58 14 - 13 @entity57 on penalties after a 1 - 1 draw			2
@entity45 beat @entity46 9 - 8 on penalties back in 2003 in the previous joint @entity8 record the longest sequence of successful kicks scored in @entity54 football is 29 , when @entity65 beat @entity66 15 - 14 in a @entity68 tie in 2013			1
@entity70 's @entity69 was the unfortunate one to miss in sudden death			0
the @entity73 record was set in november 2001 , when @entity74 beat @entity75 11 - 10			0
highest scoring shootouts at international level include the @entity79 ' 13 - 12 win over @entity80 at the @entity81 in 2007 and the @entity83 's 12 - 11 victory against @entity84 in the 2006 @entity86 semi-finals .			0

@entity0 beat @entity1 14 - 13 on penalties to reach *fourth* round of the @entity8 at @entity9
but it fell some way short of breaking the world records
the highest - scoring shootout saw 39 kicks scored in @entity97 in 1988
the longest shootout witnessed 48 kicks in @entity39 in 2005
it did break the @entity8 record of 9 - 8
