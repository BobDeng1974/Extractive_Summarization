but @entity5 walked away with only a grazed thumb despite being left trapped in the cockpit for 40 minutes , held in by his harness , as witnesses raised the alarm			1
in true ‘ @entity15 ’ spirit , the 59 - year - old said afterwards : ‘ i ’m a bit sore			2

‘ you spend all that time doing practice forced landings , it is just instinctive			0
’ @entity5 had a miraculous escape from a plane crash in @entity25 , emerging from the aircraft embedded upside down in a hedgerow with only a graze on his thumb the pilot was left trapped in the small two - seater plane , hanging by his harness in the cockpit for forty minutes while shocked residents called the emergency services more worrying than the crash itself was being trapped in the plane , he said			1
‘ i did n’t want to let go			0
if i moved i did n’t know what would happen to the thing			0
’ mr @entity5 , who has ten years ’ flying experience , tried to make an emergency landing in the two - seater plane when its engine had problems shortly after take - off from @entity46 in @entity25			1
but as he tried to glide it into a field the engine cut out			2
after briefly touching down , the light aircraft smashed through a fence and on to a private road , before flipping over on its nose and into the hedge			0
he was forced to attempt a crash landing in a field at @entity57 , near the village of @entity59 , after what is believed to be an engine failure apart from a ' bloody thumb ' , mr @entity5 , who has been flying for ten years , suffered no serious injuries in the crash , and even came back later that day to wrestle his aircraft out of the hedge mr @entity5 even returned to the scene later the same day to help wrestle the aircraft from the hedge all that stopped the plane from turning over entirely was a power line that its tail got caught on			1
@entity75 , who lives close to @entity59 village , near @entity77 , called the emergency services after hearing the crash on tuesday morning and spotting the plane in its unusual resting place			2
another resident , @entity82 , stayed with mr @entity5 , of @entity83 , while they waited for firemen to free him			1
