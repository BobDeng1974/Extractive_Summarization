@entity0 is rabbiting through reasons why he adores his job when he mentions defeat			1
‘ i like the reaction after defeat , ’ says the @entity5 manager , although he might not feel the same if he were in charge of @entity7 or @entity8			1
@entity0 has endured defeat only once in eight months , and since losing at @entity11 his team have produced four straight wins , 10 goals and top the @entity14 by three points			1
@entity0 says his side are showing champion qualities after storming start to the season signing @entity20 for @entity5 how @entity21 snubbed him why he would snub @entity23 job what makes sir @entity26 special moreover , there is a confident glint in his eye as his new - build team passes its character examinations like monday ’s win at @entity34			1
‘ i feel we can do it , ’ said @entity0 , in an interview with @entity37 to be screened on @entity38 on christmas day			1
‘ we are ready to do it			2
we really believe that we are going to do it			2
‘ at the same time , feet on the ground			2
you have to understand the country where we play			0
the level of competition makes things more difficult than everywhere else			0
@entity0 speaks to @entity37 in an interview to be screened on @entity38 on @entity50 @entity51 helped @entity5 to victory against @entity34 on monday night @entity51 celebrates a fourth win in a row to give them a three - point cushion over their rivals ‘ at the same time it ’s more beautiful because every point is a point , every game is a game and every weekend is a weekend and emotions from the beginning till the end			1
we are one of the best teams			0
we are the team that plays better football and obviously big opponents , but we are title contenders			2
’ it is a distinct change of tone from last season when he convinced few people in claiming @entity5 were the ‘ little horse ’ in a title race with @entity75 and @entity76			1
‘ maybe next year we can win it , ’ he said at the time			0
they are in front and his players believe they can do it			0
@entity0 is not as cocksure as he was on the way to winning his first @entity14 title in 2004 - 05 , when he correctly predicted his team would clinch it at @entity89			1
@entity0 celebrates @entity5 's championship success with @entity91 and @entity51 back in 2005 @entity0 takes a swig of a bottle of champagne after @entity5 won the league in 2006 but he knows how to run from the front , even if he aware that @entity34 know how to come from behind			1
it is nine years since @entity0 was top at @entity50 in @entity98			1
then , @entity5 had 46 points from 17 games and were nine clear of @entity101			1
this time , his team has 42 , three clear of @entity34			0
his last title triumph was in @entity103 in 2012 , when @entity104 led from the turn and finished with 100 points and a record 121 goals			2
‘ i know clearly the differences between @entity109 and the @entity14 , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ in @entity103 , everybody knows two teams are top of the world and a third , @entity114 , is doing well			2
after that there ’s a huge competitive difference			0
that ’s why the record is 100 points			0
that ’s not the best competition			0
it can be the best team but not the best competition			0
’ @entity0 has detected a desire from his players , boosted by the addition of @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 to the camp			1
@entity127 has made a huge impact since his summer switch to @entity132 @entity5 came off the pitch at @entity34 on monday as they did after a hard - fought win at @entity135 on the way to their first title in 2004 - 05 , which @entity0 admits is his most cherished trophy of those won at @entity132			1
it is why he spoke about a win worth ‘ more than three points ’ on monday			0
@entity0 values these mental qualities highly			1
sometimes the most gifted footballers never acquire them			0
‘ somebody who thinks about the others , who thinks about the team , who is not selfish , not egocentric , ’ said @entity0 , when asked to name a player ’s most important asset			1
‘ when you find these guys now , it is like special birth that you find once in a while			2
these are the ones that you have to take really good care of			0
’ @entity5 supporters scramble to grab @entity0 's medal after he tossed it into the crowd in 2006 when he won his last @entity14 title , in 2006 , @entity0 threw his medal into the crowd			1
perhaps he did not expect to wait so long for the next one			0
‘ i ’m not the kind of guy that wants to celebrate a lot the title			2
i always believe that ’s not the last one , ’ he said			0
‘ football is an industry where people have a short memory , so for me the measure of my success is to win the next match			0
‘ i have the dream job			0
i do n’t need motivation			0
i like to train , i like to study opponents , i like to play , i like to analyse the game , i like the feeling of a victory , i like the reaction after defeat			2
‘ if i finished today , what i ’ve done would be enough to be a successful manager but , i prefer to think that the next game is the most important thing , and the next title is the most important thing			2
” @entity0 was speaking to @entity37 as part of a @entity195 double - bill of ‘ @entity196 ’ which features exclusive interviews with @entity0 and sir @entity26			1
