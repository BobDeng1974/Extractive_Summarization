it has now emerged she suffered a ' catastrophic severance injury ' to her lower right leg after falling down the chute , @entity18 reports			1
the tragic death of 24 - year - old @entity8 was ruled to have been an accident coroner @entity23 found ms @entity8 was in an alcohol and @entity26 sleeping pill stupor , or a ' state similar to that of sleepwalking ' , when she climbed into the chute and began climbing down			1
he determined ms @entity8 's ' enthusiasm for climbing and penchant for physically challenging activity ' had played a part in her descent down the chute			1

either way , he determined she climbed into the chute without any awareness of the danger of her behaviour			0
the @entity2 woman 's body was discovered at the bottom of her luxury apartment building ' the precise effect that ( sleeping pills ) and alcohol had upon her can not be established to a great degree of certainty , ' mr @entity23 said			1
' i am satisfied however that her use of these substances in combination did in fact impact upon her mental state in a significant way and directly led to her entry into the chute			0

mr @entity15 said in a statement on wednesday : ' it was hard enough to lose @entity8 , who was a vibrant and loving young women in her mid- 20s when she died four years ago , but it was even harder dealing with the false claims and totally unjustified allegations which followed			2
