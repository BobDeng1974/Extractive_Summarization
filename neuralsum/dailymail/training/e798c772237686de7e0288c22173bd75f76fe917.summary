@entity16 , who presided over his son 's same - sex wedding ceremony and vowed to perform other gay marriages if asked , can return to the pulpit after a @entity10 appeals panel overturned a decision to defrock him mr @entity16 does a dance step after a reporter 's question as the reverend @entity40 , left , looks on during the news conference the church suspended mr @entity16 , 52 , of @entity43 , @entity2 , for officiating his son 's 2007 wedding , then defrocked him when he refused to promise to uphold the @entity10 law book ' in its entirety ' , including its ban on clergy performing same - sex marriages			1
mr @entity16 appealed , arguing the decision was wrong because it was based on an assumption he would break church law in the future			2
the pastor smiles at the end of the news conference , feeling vindicated following the decision to overturn the order to defrock him the appeals panel , which met in @entity61 , @entity62 , last week to hear the case , upheld a 30 - day suspension that @entity16 has already served and said he should get back pay dating to when the suspension ended in december			1

the pastor who prosecuted @entity16 , the @entity75 , said he has not made a decision about an appeal at a news conference in @entity31 , mr @entity16 said he expects to take a job with the @entity68 in @entity89 , a liberal bastion where there is presumably little chance he would be punished for defying church doctrine on homosexuality			2
the issue of gay marriage has long roiled the @entity10 , the nation 's second - largest protestant denomination			2
hundreds of @entity10 ministers have publicly rejected church policies that allow gay members but ban ' self - avowed practicing homosexuals ' from becoming clergy and forbid ministers from performing same - sex marriages			0

mr @entity16 puts on a rainbow stole during the conference to symbolize his continued support for same - sex marriage and willingness to perform gay ceremonies mr @entity16 said tuesday 's decision ' signals a major change within the @entity10 , for sure			1
' the appeals panel , however , suggested it was not making a broader statement about the church 's position on homosexuality but based its decision solely on the facts of mr @entity16 's case			1
the jury 's punishment was illegal under church law , the appeals panel concluded , writing in its decision that ' revoking his credentials can not be squared with the well - established principle that our clergy can only be punished for what they have been convicted of doing in the past , not for what they may or may not do in the future			1
' the decision also noted that mr @entity16 's son had asked him to perform the wedding ; that the ceremony was small and private , held not in a @entity68 but in a @entity151 restaurant ; and that @entity16 did not publicize the wedding until a member of his congregation learned of it and filed the complaint in april 2013			1
' the committee notes that , in another case involving different facts , a majority of its members might well have concluded that a different penalty better serves the cause of achieving a just resolution , ' the panel said , adding that some of its members wanted a longer suspension for mr @entity16			0
mr @entity16 said he expects the decision to stand			0
' the church is changing , ' he said , ' and that is good news for everybody			0
