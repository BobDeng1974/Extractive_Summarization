by @entity0 published : 13:42 est , 7 february 2014 @entity2 : 05:50 est , 10 february 2014 flight simulators have come a long way since they were first dreamt up at the turn of the 20th century			0
the first rudimentary designs quickly evolved from bizarre ‘ rocking ’ cockpits to the terrifyingly realistic simulators used today			0
back in the 1950s , simulators were used to train pilots on some the most technically - challenging aircraft around			0
the @entity13 flight simulator , built in 1953 was one of eleven ever made			1
weighing in at nine tonnes and costing £ 520,000 ( $ 853,000 ) , the simulator took three technicians to maintain these incredible images reveal the inner workings of a machine that prepared pilots to fly a @entity22 - era kc - 97 stratotanker			1
among other things , the @entity23 was used to perform a mid-air fuel transfer between aircraft			0
pilots would spend hours at the controls of this £ 520,000 ( $ 853,000 ) simulator before they ever set foot in the real thing , according to a report in the @entity33			0
these incredible images reveal the bizarre inner workings of a machine that prepared pilots to fly a prop - driven , @entity22 - era @entity37 its four analog computers had to be programmed before each training session via stacks of ' resistance cards ' that dictated the behaviour of the simulator 's 117 motor - driven resistors the @entity13 was an aerial refueling tanker variant of the @entity47 the @entity48 began operating the @entity13 in 1950 when it purchased a total of 816 from @entity50			2
the @entity13 used piston engines , fuelled by aviation gasoline , but it carried jet fuel for its refuelling mission			2
the kc - 97 saw service well into the @entity57 era			0
there were 888 c - 97s built between 1951 and 1956 , 814 of these were modified to @entity13 tankers			2
built in 1953 , the @entity23 weighed a nine tonnes , required three technicians to operate and was one of only eleven ever made			1
the simulator was crammed with a maze of dials , instruments , switches and other gears that would surround the pilot , co-pilot and flight engineer			2
according to a 1968 @entity75 press release , it was used to familiarise flight crews with proper pre-flight checks including take - off procedures , emergency flight operating procedures and fuel management			0
its four analog computers had to be programmed before each training session via stacks of ‘ resistance cards ’ that dictated the behaviour of the simulator 's 117 motor - driven resistors			0
the 1968 release states that the ‘ power equipment around the device generates enough heat each hour to warm two small homes			1
’ this simulator appears to have remained in operation as part of the 128th @entity97 of the @entity98 until the early 1970s			1
the 128th @entity97 still has a dedicated training simulator located on base , though now it is an digital , full motion @entity102 simulator made by @entity50			1
