a shocking tuberculosis outbreak in a @entity2 hospital has now hit home for three more terrorized homes after a nurse 's assistant was allowed to continue working with newborns for weeks after she began showing symptoms of the disease			1
eight babies have tested positive for @entity12 following the august 21 discovery that a @entity15 nursery employee suffered from the active , highly contagious form of the disease , it was reported last week			1
the revelation that the @entity20 nurse had reported symptoms as far back as july has now become all the more disturbing as authorities have raised the number of infants possibly exposed to 860			1
shocking : eight infants born at an @entity20 , @entity2 hospital have tested positive for tuberculosis after a nursery employee worked with babies in the ward for weeks or more while extremely contagious ( stock photo ) the unidentified hospital employee worked at @entity33 in @entity20			1
she potentially exposed 860 babies to @entity12 , it was revealed last week the mantoux test is a widely used test for latent @entity12 and is used on both adults and children			1
it involves injecting a substance called @entity42 into the skin of the forearm			0
if the patient has latent @entity12 infection , their skin will be sensitive to @entity50 tuberculin and a hard red bump will develop at the site of the injection , usually within 48 to 72 hours of having the test			0
if they have a very strong skin reaction , they may need a chest x-ray to confirm whether they have an active @entity12 infection			2
if they do not have a latent infection , their skin will not react to the mantoux test			0
the infants who 've tested positive all have a latent form of tuberculosis and have been offered treatment that will prevent them from becoming ill. @entity20 public health director @entity69 said thursday that of the eight , five babies had been vaccinated previously against @entity12 and their results may be false positives			1
the report from the @entity74 reveals that the nurse assistant on july 2 told others at @entity33 she was fatigued and coughing up blood			1
however , she did n't stop working until after her aug. 15 shift and her private doctor diagnosed her with the active form of the disease on aug. 21			1
dozens of the potentially infected babies came from nearby @entity84			0
the hospital worker may have also exposed about 40 other hospital workers starting all the way back in september 2013 , said dr. @entity88 , the health authority for @entity90			1
@entity88 did n't say how the nursery worker may have contracted the disease , citing privacy laws			1
employment and medical records were reviewed to determine which infants and hospital workers may have been exposed			1
@entity88 noted that @entity12 is treatable and said the possible exposure at the hospital does n't represent a public health threat			2
the discovery of the infected employee also prompted an inspection of the hospital by regulators , who found several violations that could threaten the hospital 's @entity108 funding and posed ' an immediate jeopardy to patient safety , ' said @entity112 , deputy regional administrator for the @entity74			2
@entity112 declined to specify the violations , saying only that they were in the areas of infection control , patient rights and management oversight			0
he also declined to say if the violations were related to the @entity12 exposure			0
as of october , the hospital says it passed the first inspection by federal health authorities and inspectors will return in december			1
bacterial scourge : the bacterial infection is spread through the air when someone sick with @entity12 coughs or sneezes			0
the infected person must have the active form of the disease in order to be contagious @entity12 was a major killer of humans and scourge to societies dating back to ancient @entity136			1
the potentially deadly disease of the lungs still rears its head today , so what should you know about @entity12 ? ancient scourge : an x-ray of a human chest reveals pulmonary tuberculosis q : how is @entity12 transmitted ? a : people with active @entity12 , which travels through the air , can transmit the bacteria when they cough , sneeze or even speak			2
@entity12 is unique because it remains airborne for prolonged periods of time , unlike the flu virus , which travels in droplets of fluid expelled from the body , according to @entity156 , an epidemiology professor at @entity157			0
but the illness is hard to catch			0
@entity156 noted that it can only be spread by someone with active @entity12			2
@entity161 , founder of the @entity163 @entity162 in @entity164 , said tb also requires prolonged exposure			0
q : what are the symptoms and how is @entity12 treated ? a : symptoms of active @entity12 include muscle weakness and general sickness , weight loss , fever and night sweats			2
@entity12 also usually includes coughing , chest pain or coughing up blood			0
people infected with @entity12 are given a four - drug treatment over 6 to 12 months			0
people who stop treatment or do n't take the medication as prescribed may become sick again and cause the bacteria to become resistant to the drugs , creating a far more deadly microbe that is much harder to treat			0
q : how prevalent is tb in the @entity186 ? a : last year , nearly 9,600 cases of active @entity12 were reported in the @entity186 , and about 65 percent of those cases were among people born outside the @entity186 , according to the @entity190			2
most people living in the @entity186 and areas with access to good health care will not die from @entity12 if treated , though drug - resistant @entity12 is more deadly .			0
