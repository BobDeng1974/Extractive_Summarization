by @entity0 published : 20:54 est , 27 october 2013 updated : 20:54 est , 27 october 2013 smokers are being encouraged to attend aa - style meetings on the high street in a bid to help them quit , it has emerged			1
boots has set up free ‘ @entity9 ’ clinics at more than 500 stores nationwide to encourage their customers to kick the habit			1
the sessions are being run by pharmacists or healthcare assistants who have undergone training on the @entity17 ’s stop smoking programme and also had some ‘ behavioural smoking ’ education to help them fully understand why people smoke and find it hard to give up cigarettes			1
boots has set up free ' @entity9 ' clinics at more than 500 stores nationwide to encourage their customers to kick the habit after an initial consultation , where the pharmacist builds up a smoking profile of the individual - for example , why they want to give up , how many cigarettes they smoke and when , a programme of nicotine replacement products , such as patches or gum , are prescribed at discounted prices			1
the smoker is then urged to attend their first aa - style support group , alongside other addicts or on their own , 10 days later and encouraged to regularly attend weekly or fortnightly meetings to help them to cut down and eventually quit			0
incentives being offered to attend the clinics also include 100 extra reward points on their @entity48 loyalty card for each time they attend			2
the sessions have been prompted following a change in guidelines from the @entity53 , which for the first time in june advised health professionals to talk about the benefits of ‘ harm reduction ’ by cutting down on cigarettes , rather than simply concentrating on forcing people to quit completely			2
previously , smokers may be forced to wait up to six months should they slip up and admit to having a cigarette before being accepted on a new @entity17 programme , but the ‘ smoke less ’ sessions recognise that relapses may occur and do not penalise people for falling off the wagon			1
if a customer is found to be eligible for a stop smoking programme on the @entity17 they will still be referred , but will also get help from the @entity23 programme , allowing the pair to run alongside each other			2
@entity73 , 35 , joined one of the ‘ @entity9 ’ clinics at her local @entity77 branch of boots , central @entity79 , last month			1
‘ i started smoking at the age of 16 and did n’t worry about my health until i was in my early 30s , ’ she said			0
‘ i tried the @entity17 program but could n’t cut down completely in the shorter time frame , due to social situations , where the temptation was too great			0
after an initial consultation a programme of nicotine replacement products , such as patches or gum , are prescribed at discounted prices ‘ i wanted to start a family and knew i was n’t the sort of person who can cut cigarettes out completely but would prefer to gradually cut down first			1
i ’ve been to the @entity23 clinic three times now , and the advice and help they give you is extremely supportive			0
‘ i ’ve not smoked for two weeks thanks to their encouragement			0
there was one occasion where i did slip up in the first week and they did n’t make me feel like a failure			0
‘ i know it ’s going to be a long battle , but for the first time i actually feel that it ’s achievable			0
’ @entity111 , healthcare buying manager for boots , said the idea behind the clinics was to provide as much support as possible for smokers once they make the decision to quit or cut down			1
‘ following months of customer research we identified the need for a different type of behavioural service for people who wanted to quit or cut down on their smoking , but who recognised that they needed help and support in doing so , ’ he said			0
‘ the ‘ @entity9 ’ clinics are a unique service , in the mould of @entity132 for slimmers and aa for alcoholics , for people who maybe find it difficult to cut cigarettes out of their lives completely straight away			1
‘ with the help and encouragement of our pharmacists and other smokers we hope they will be able to reduce the amount they smoke , with a view to coming off them altogether in the long run			1
‘ we want to help those who cut down from 20 a day to 10 , or who want to stop smoking in the week , but carry on at the weekend , as well as those determined to quit completely			0
‘ the service is also different because we recognise relapses can and will occur and there ’s no penalty for this			0
instead the clinics will provide support for those who need to get back on track			2
it ’s all about rewarding the effort and not labelling the odd slip up as failure			0
’ if it proves successful the programme will be run out to more than 1,000 stores nationwide in january .			2

@entity9 clinics will encourage customers to kick the habit
sessions will be run by pharmacists or trained healthcare assistants
smokers will be given discounted nicotine replacement products
