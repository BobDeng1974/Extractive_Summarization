on and off the pitch there is perhaps one word which best describes @entity3 – genuine			1
shortly before meeting him for the first time , i was warned – albeit with a smile – that i would hear him before i saw him			0
that was in july , 2008 and he had just signed for @entity11 from @entity12			1
i interviewed him at the club ’s training ground and there was no need for an interpreter , @entity3 insisting from the off that he used @entity19			2
@entity11 's @entity3 has been battling testicular cancer and the chemotherapy has caused hair loss the first thing that strikes you is his gregarious nature , he ’s larger than life but endearing and infectious with it			1
it was , then , a shock to learn of his battle with testicular cancer and to see the tv interview in which @entity3 – wearing a baseball cap having lost his hair following chemotherapy – revealed his illness			1
for while we all know that cancer does not discriminate , here was a supreme athlete once nicknamed @entity40 – the @entity41 – for his indefatigable efforts on the field			1
but when he arrived at @entity11 it was the moniker ‘ @entity47 ’ we were all talking about			2
during his time at @entity12 , @entity3 , after a visit to the cinema to see @entity47 , had promised a boy he would don the superhero ’s mask the next time he scored a goal			2
and so he duly did , producing the disguise from his shorts following a solo strike against @entity59			0
the @entity61 midfielder is known for his gregarious , larger - than - life personality that is hard to dislike type ‘ @entity3 ’ into @entity70 and enjoy it for yourselves , you ’ll see what i mean about his fun - loving nature from the celebration as he mimics spinning a web			1
one person who certainly thought @entity3 was a superhero was my own mam			2
following a pre-season friendly against @entity76 in the summer he signed , i interviewed @entity3 pitchside			2
@entity77 was manager and he ’d invited my family – waiting for me in the stands – down to the dugout area to watch me perform			0
after the interview i introduced @entity3 to my parents , shaking my dad warmly by the hand and giving my mam a kiss on either cheek			1
it was then that we realised her shoe was caught in the drain on the fringe of the pitch			0
without further notice @entity3 was down on all fours manoeuvring the shoe back and forth in a bid to free it			2
thirty seconds and two more kisses later we were all on our way			0
he ’d even signed the matchday programmes of which he was the cover star			0
in fact , i have never seen @entity104 refuse an autograph or an interview			0
his willingness to engage with team - mates , press and supporters made him instantly popular on @entity111			0
@entity3 was loaned out to @entity112 last season but they were relegated from the @entity115 he backed it up on a saturday afternoon as well			0
he was so impressive on his debut at @entity118 – a 1 - 1 draw – that @entity120 said on @entity121 that he could be the signing of the season			0
sadly , with @entity77 gone before the month was out , @entity11 were ultimately relegated			0
@entity3 , though , stayed and played a key role in the club regaining their top - flight status – there was also the long - awaited appearance of the @entity47 mask at @entity130 following a fine goal against @entity132			1
it had been in his shorts for over a year ! it was during the @entity137 season that his best friend and @entity61 compatriot , @entity140 , scored one of his first goals for the club at @entity144			0
in 2008 , @entity120 said on @entity121 that @entity3 could be the signing of the season as we waited to speak to the scorer – who still had n’t emerged from the dressing - room – we noticed the team bus starting its engine			1
taking matters into our own hands , we entered the crumbling changing quarters of @entity156 to be met by the sight of @entity3 and @entity140 - still wrapped in their towels and the last two present – enjoying the beats of their infamous ( the other players occasionally took the mickey ) @entity165 sounds			1
rather than chase us , @entity3 offered to play the role of interpreter and so @entity140 gave his first interview to the press as a @entity11 player			1
when @entity3 revealed his cancer treatment he , of course , spoke fondly of @entity140 , thanking him for his support			1
and in the hours since , thousands of fans , team - mates and sportsmen from around the world have come out and offered their thoughts and support to @entity3 and his family			1
that is the reason for a few of the above personal recollections , hopefully illustrating in a small way what a genuine guy he really is			0
get well soon , @entity3 .			0
