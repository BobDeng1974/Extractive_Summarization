@entity73 calls himself the special brew to @entity8 's @entity115 , in light of the ale that has been created in his name by a local brewery			1

@entity29 were the team conducting incisive attacks			2
@entity256 's pace particularly troubled @entity12			1
one passing move started from the back and involved six @entity29 players before @entity65 sent his header wide			2
just after the half hour , @entity28 set @entity81 away on a counter attack and when he picked out @entity39 in the middle it seemed a goal was inevitable			1
but the @entity253 @entity286 winner instead nodded back across and @entity29 scrambled clear			2
that may influence who starts against @entity289 on saturday			0
' at the end we had a glass of wine , ' said @entity73			0
' he is an example for any young manager how to operate			0
' @entity8 and @entity28 , examples alike			1

@entity12 went ahead early in the second half when @entity28 *converted* @entity81 's through ball
but @entity29 equalised through substitute @entity66 in the 77th minute
@entity26 headed into his own net four minutes later to seal victory for @entity8 's side
the result sends @entity12 into the last eight of the @entity16
