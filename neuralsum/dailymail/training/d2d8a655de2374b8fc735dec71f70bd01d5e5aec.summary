by @entity0 last updated at 4:32 pm on 7th december 2011 @entity1 and @entity2 - who have been behind an action plan to save the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis - are at risk of not signing it off this week			1
@entity2 officials have said the leaders of both countries will not leave friday 's @entity13 summit until a ' powerful ' deal is reached			1
but a senior @entity1 official has given a downbeat assessment of its prospects and said the first step in the deal may not be agreed until at least @entity21			0
@entity23 reports : a @entity2 minister has said a deal will be thrashed out by @entity26 ( left ) and @entity27 ( right ) on friday , but @entity1 officials are not so sure the official said : ' i have to say today that i am more pessimistic than last week about reaching an overall deal			1
a lot of protagonists still have not understood how serious the situation is			0
' my pessimism stems from the overall picture that i see at this point , in which institutions and member states will have to move on many points to make possible the new treaty rules that we are aiming for			0
' the @entity1 comment is being seen as apparent effort to jolt partners into accepting @entity48 's terms and restrictions			0
the news has sent @entity52 share prices tumbling			2
the @entity53 closed 0.77 per cent down at 5,526 ; @entity1 's @entity54 ended 0.73 per cent down at 5,985 ; and @entity2 's @entity55 finished 0.38 per cent down at 3,167			1
and it comes hours after a leaked report from @entity59 president @entity58 said a quick - fix solution to the eurozone debt crisis could be achieved without changing the treaties that bind the @entity13			1
in his interim dossier , prepared for the crucial @entity13 summit that starts tomorrow , he said only minor tweaks were needed to save the euro			1
his ' fiscal compact ' plan would not need to undergo the lengthy process of ratification by parliaments or national referendums			1
leaked report : @entity59 president @entity58 ( left ) says only minor tweaks are needed to save the euro , as @entity77 treasury secretary @entity76 ( right ) is in @entity52 for a three - day blitz of eurozone officials the draft report states that tougher fiscal reforms can be adopted simply by amending a protocol , which would only need national consensus			1
@entity58 , who will chair the two - day summit , said this would speed up the implementation of reforms , and remove any potential political complications			0
he proposed that each eurozone member 's budget should be below 3 per cent of @entity92 , national debt under 60 per cent , and a ' golden rule ' should be enshrined to guarantee balanced budgets in the medium term			1
it also suggested that the eurozone bailout fund should be given a banking licence to borrow directly from the @entity99 , and that the @entity59 should have the power to impose austerity measures automatically on countries which require bailouts			1
@entity2 president @entity27 , @entity1 chancellor @entity26 , @entity105 chief @entity104 and even @entity77 treasury secretary @entity76 are all starring in the financial drama leading up to this friday 's summit of 27 @entity13 leaders			1
if the summit is a failure , @entity27 warned last week , ' the world will not wait for @entity52 ' and it could spell the end of the 17 country eurozone			1
today , @entity76 is in @entity2 for talks with @entity27 and the prime minister - elect of @entity117 , @entity118			2
he will also meet @entity120 pm @entity119 in @entity121 just before the new @entity120 leader heads for the @entity13 summit in @entity124			0
later on , many of @entity52 's most important leaders will be in @entity127 , @entity2 , for a meeting of the conservative - leaning @entity129			1
@entity26 , @entity27 and @entity117 's new conservative prime minister , @entity118 , will all be there			0
and tomorrow , the @entity105 holds its monthly policy meeting			0
many analysts expect one or more actions by the bank aimed at boosting growth and steadying the financial system			0
but @entity1 has opposed the @entity99 funding move by saying it would breach a ban on the bank 's financing governments			0
and the same official said that such a plan to merely amend existing regulations would ' fall short of what we want , which is a clear legal framework to institute a new stability culture '			0
some of @entity58 's plans are the same as those proposed on monday by @entity1 chancellor @entity26 and @entity2 president @entity27			1
but @entity151 , as the pair have been dubbed , want to push through more radical measures in a bid to introduce a new @entity13 treaty by march			1
they want to automatically penalise countries that run up a deficit of more than 3 per cent of its gdp and are urging eurozone leaders to meet every month until the crisis is over			0
and they have said that if all 27 @entity13 members can not agree on a way forward , then they are prepared to work towards a new treaty involving the eurozone bloc and any other country that wants to join			2
this could leave @entity169 , which is not part of the eurozone , feeling more isolated			2
@entity58 also acknowledged that more far - reaching reforms would eventually require a change in @entity13 treaties			0
plans are also being drawn up for a financial ' bazooka ' that would see the creation of two separate rescue funds			0
it would also involve winning increased support for the @entity181			2
this three - pronged rescue system would form part of a carefully crafted package @entity13 leaders hope will win over financial markets and would be introduced alongside plans to re-write @entity13 treaties			0
sources have said negotiators are debating letting the eurozone 's existing 440 billion euro bail - out fund to continue working when a new 500 billion euro facility comes into force in mid- 2012			2
this would almost double the firepower of the financial rescue system			0
@entity151 's plans have been backed by the @entity77 in their plans , with its treasury secretary @entity76 currently on a three - day blitz of eurozone officials			1
up and down : @entity52 markets have fluctuated today with the announcement by the @entity59 president , and then the warning an agreement may not be reached by friday he said yesterday that the @entity208 had no plans to give money to the @entity181 to boost the eurozone 's bailout fund			1
@entity76 stressed more action was needed to boost economic growth in @entity52 , alongside the longer - term reforms			1
he will meet @entity2 president @entity27 in @entity216 today			2
his support for the @entity219 - @entity1 blueprint came after credit rating agency @entity220 fired two warning shots at the bloc			0
confident : @entity2 finance minister @entity223 said neither @entity27 nor @entity26 would leave the negotiating table of the summit until there is a powerful deal just hours after the two leaders announced their plan on monday , @entity220 put the credit ratings of 15 countries , including @entity1 and @entity2 , on review for a downgrade			1
it cited ' continuing disagreements among @entity52 policy makers on how to tackle the immediate market confidence crisis '			2
and today @entity76 told reporters after talking with @entity2 finance minister @entity223 : ' i have a lot of confidence in what the president of @entity2 and the minister are doing , working with @entity1 to build a stronger @entity52			1
' @entity223 added : ' neither @entity27 nor @entity26 will leave the negotiating table of this summit until there is a powerful deal			1
' @entity248 , chairman of euro zone finance ministers , said he was astonished by @entity220 's announcement , which he called ' a wild exaggeration and also unfair ' because it failed to take account of @entity120 's new austerity plan			2
it then went a step further yesterday , placing the top - notch rating of the eurozone 's 440 billion euro rescue fund , the @entity256 ( @entity256 ) , on negative watch since it depends on the creditworthiness of the bloc 's six @entity263 - rated countries			2
@entity117 prime minister - elect @entity118 - who is due to meet @entity76 later on wednesday at a congress of @entity52 conservative leaders in the southern @entity2 port of @entity127 - said he would support a new treaty			1
but some other @entity13 governments , notably @entity169 , @entity270 and the @entity271 , are reluctant to amend the @entity13 charter , either due to eurosceptics at home or because they fear losing possible referendums on ratification			0
figures released on wednesday showed just how urgently some @entity52 banks need help			2
@entity120 banks had to borrow 153.2 billion euros in emergency liquidity from the @entity105 in november , up from 111.3 billion euros at the end of october			0
it was another big leap in reliance on the central bank which has almost quadrupled since june , when @entity120 lenders took 41.3 billion euros			0
@entity288 banks took more than $ 50 billion in the @entity99 's first dollar funding operation since the world 's leading central banks agreed last week to cut their cost , five times the $ 10 billion forecast in a poll of money market traders			0
and @entity1 is set to reactivate a bank rescue fund created at the height of the 2008 financial crisis at next week 's cabinet meeting , a government official said .			0

but @entity2 *vow* not to leave friday 's summit until ' powerful deal ' reached
@entity77 treasury secretary backs @entity151 's plan
@entity59 president says only minor tweaks needed to treaty , not a new one
protocol switch would avoid need for costly national referendums
@entity52 markets dip : @entity53 , @entity55 and @entity54 all close trading down
@entity77 @entity208 will not give @entity181 cash to boost eurozone bailout fund
