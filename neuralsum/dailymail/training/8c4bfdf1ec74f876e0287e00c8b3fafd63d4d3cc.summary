former @entity1 and @entity2 winger @entity0 has confirmed he intends to challenge @entity3 for the @entity5 presidency			1
but the 47 - year - old ’s bid to become the most powerful man in football could be over before it ’s even started after questions were asked about the legitimacy of @entity0 ’s candidacy			1
his press conference on friday morning was backed by bookmakers @entity14 - known for long list of high - profile pr stunts , but not for major sports announcements - and he must meet strict @entity5 regulations to run against @entity3			1
the former player is receiving a £ 250,000 fee from the bookmakers to front the presidency campaign			2
@entity14 are inviting people to become members on teamginola.com to pledge support and cash			2
paid - for memberships range from £ 5 to £ 40,000			2
@entity14 are aiming to raise £ 2.3million by the end of february to fund the campaign			2
@entity14 himself admitted it was their idea to back a candidate and that @entity0 , being paid £ 250,000 by the bookmakers to run , topped their shortlist			1
@entity0 has no known football administration experience and must now prove to @entity5 by january 29 he has played an ‘ active role ’ for at least two of the last five years , and that he has the support of five national associations			1
that gives @entity0 less than two weeks to ensure he can compete against odds - on favourite @entity3 as the 78 - year - old attempts to win a fifth term			1
the @entity62 and @entity63 attacking midfielder has yet to receive the support of five associations and called on the public to help raise £ 2.3million to fight for election on may 29 in @entity69			1
if the full amount is raised , @entity0 could stand to earn an extra £ 130,000 with 10 per cent of the final £ 1.3m raised being pocketed by the @entity2			1
@entity0 faced awkward questions during the announcement about the legitimacy of his bid , his ‘ active role ’ and why he should be taken seriously , particularly if being paid			2
‘ i ’ve been working in many things			0
i work for a club in the south of @entity2 , as a consultant , and give my advice to those guys who needed help at the time , ’ @entity0 said			1

i want a fair game			0
‘ three things are very important : transparency , democracy , and equality			0
that ’s the main thing i want to achieve			0
‘ the first thing is to get the five associations			0
that will be the main task in the next few days			0
it ’s not an easy thing			0
@entity0 must get the support of five national football associations before he can stand @entity0 played in the @entity120 for @entity121 , @entity1 , @entity122 and @entity63 before retiring in 2002 ‘ it is a proper job			1
it is probably the hardest job of my entire life			0
being a footballer is an easy task , compared to what i ’m doing right now			0
’ asked to outline his knowledge on @entity5 members , @entity0 answered : ‘ i need obviously to know a lot more about @entity5			1
‘ the most important thing i guess is to be standing in front of you today , thinking , well , what can i change ? what can i do for the game ? ‘ crucial to that element is the right of football fans to have a say in who will represent them at the highest level in the game			0
we will deliver a new and fair democratic process			0
‘ the football community will be asked to elect our officials			0
there ’s no room for doubt in football			0
