@entity10 portrait photographer @entity9 's @entity8 fine art series sees pieces including the @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 bought to life			1
he shot the same models in contrasting white and black outfits as a ‘ set of archetypes that convey different aspects of human nature ’			1
@entity22 : @entity10 photographer mr @entity9 has brought chess pieces to life with a series of stunning portraits the @entity10 - born snapper spent nine months working on the project , carefully choosing which costumes to use the photographer explained that he 's always been very interested in chess - but he 's not an expert it took nine months to realise the project , including researching the right period costume for each of the twelve characters			1
mr @entity9 said : ‘ i have always been fascinated about @entity51			1
when i was a child , my father taught me the rules of the game and we used to play together			2
that said , i 'm certainly not an expert on it , but still today i love to play chess with friends			0
so , probably this is the roots of the whole idea			0
‘ the idea to humanise the different pieces of the chess board came to me probably a couple of years ago , and it took a while to grow and shape in my mind			0
mr @entity9 was keen to explore the light and dark sides of human nature - the dualism that exists in us all pawn broker : mr @entity9 said he had great fun - and it was inspirational - choosing all the costumes mr @entity9 divides his time between @entity10 - he was born in @entity67 - and @entity68 and often shoots adverts ‘ to me , the most interesting part of the whole project was the possibility to portray the same character both in black and white			1
to highlight different and sometimes opposite parts of the human nature , that often coexist in each of us			0
' chess figures offer an opportunity to explore this dualism			0
as a portrait photographer , i 've always been interested in these different feelings that could emerge in the subjects in front of my lens			2
‘ the fact that the chess game has a set of six different archetypes - the @entity13 , the @entity12 , the @entity90 , the @entity91 , the @entity14 , the pawn - to work with , gives me the possibility to explore different parts of human nature			2
and , actually , it was a great source of inspiration to play with period dresses and costumes			0
