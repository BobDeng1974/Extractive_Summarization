whatever other labels get attached to @entity2 , it can not be said he lacks ambition			1
that much was obvious on saturday night in the @entity5 long after the crowds had gone and a question was asked about @entity9 ’s threat to quit his role as @entity12 chairman			1
@entity2 ’s mood in that instant stopped being that of the proud manager whose fresh start had ended with an impressive 1 - 1 draw against @entity19			1
@entity2 barks instructions during his first game back in management for a year @entity2 's first game in charge of @entity12 ended in a 1 - 1 draw with @entity19 at the @entity5 @entity9 was seen crying as @entity12 fans sang his name before they faced @entity19 on saturday @entity12 owner @entity9 ( left ) says he will quit his position if found guilty by the @entity29 @entity30 opened the scoring with a stunning free - kick that looped over the @entity19 wall he became obdurate , possibly annoyed as talk turned to @entity9 ’s promise from earlier in the day to resign if the @entity29 so much as suggest he is racist			1
‘ i ’ll talk to you about the game , guys , because you ’ve had your pound of flesh from me on everything else , ’ @entity2 said			1
on the conversation went : ‘ but @entity44 , does n’t it concern you that he is even considering stepping down ? he ’s the owner , he brought you in			0
’ @entity2 replied : ‘ i ’ll talk all day long about football			1
if you ’re here for different agendas you ’re wasting your time			0
’ with that , it was possible to deduce that he wanted to draw a line under the public discussion of his text messages and the ham - fisted justifications from his new employers			2
football talk only , please			0
@entity56 spoiled @entity12 's party with his equaliser for @entity19 at the @entity5 @entity56 celebrates with team - mate @entity59 ( top ) after his goal levelled the scores at 1 - 1 except @entity2 is still the subject of a farcically long @entity29 investigation and until its conclusions are reached , the suggestion that issues of racist , homophobic and sexist texts — and the consequences of @entity9 talking about those issues — should be parked is hopeful in the extreme			1
then again , this is football , where serious issues go with the wind if results are right			0
at least @entity2 got that much right on saturday			1
@entity19 are a top - three side and came in on the back of one defeat in 12 ; @entity12 are bottom three and had won one in 12			1
but there was no escaping what has gone on			0
@entity12 ’s shirts carried a black strip across the shoulders where once was the name of @entity86 , a sponsor that no longer wants the association			2
a @entity12 supporter backs @entity90 chairman @entity9 after a difficult week in which he was branded a ' racist ' @entity9 looked on without many smiles			1
the 77 - year - old owner was clapped to his seat ahead of the match			2
he appeared to wipe tears from his eyes			0
they love @entity9 in the stadium that carries his name			2
as one supporter ’s sign read : ‘ @entity9 is a legend			2
’ it added : ‘ football is a game , do not mix with politics			0
’ only politics has nothing to do with this			0
it is about views that are unacceptable from anyone , even those who work in football			0
it would be ambitious to expect that penny to drop any time soon .			0
