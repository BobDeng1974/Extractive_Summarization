by @entity0 published : 07:24 est , 4 october 2013 updated : 15:54 est , 4 october 2013 for almost 100 years , @entity2 ’s chocolate has been swathed in a distinctive purple wrapping that made it stand out from rivals			1
but yesterday it lost the exclusive right to the iconic colour in a court battle with @entity9			1
following the ruling by the @entity12 , trademark lawyer @entity10 said : ‘ this is a massive blow to @entity2			1
while the challenge to @entity2 was brought by @entity9 , the impact is that any supermarket or rival could now use ‘ @entity2 purple ’ on their products			1
the decision opens up the possibility that rivals could launch a host of copycat products to try and cash in on the success of the @entity53 bar and other products , such as @entity55 and heroes			1
the decision was announced by the @entity12 today and came as a shock after @entity2 had won its case at all earlier stages of the legal battle			1
following a victory at an earlier stage , a spokesman said : ‘ @entity65 is a colour that has been used by @entity2 for more than 100 years - the colour has always been associated with @entity2			1
‘ @entity65 was queen @entity35 's favourite colour and the @entity2 brothers were loyal supporters of the @entity24			1
we have gone to great lengths to guard our trademark rights and … we have been looking to protect the colour for years			1
. workers pictured wrapping the dairy milk chocolates at the @entity2 factory at @entity78 in 1930 advert for @entity2 's @entity80 in 1905 , before it had adopted its purple colour @entity2 was given a royal warrant by @entity23 in february 1854 - making the company the official cocoa and chocolate makers for the monarch			1
among its adverts from that era is one showing @entity35 drinking @entity90 while sitting in a train			1
the firm first introduced the purple - her favourite colour - in 1914 as a tribute to her and it has identified its products on sweet shop shelves ever since			1
@entity53 started out in pale mauve with a red script			1
the full dairy milk range became purple and gold in 1920			1
the @entity2 family were one of the driving forces of philanthropy in the late stages of the @entity105 era , when society grew more reflective on what had been an age of growing social and economic division			2
the industrial revolution had driven prosperity and attracted millions of people to the cities in search of work			2
yet millions of those workers lived in abject poverty as characterised in the works of @entity119 and other authors			2
as @entity121 , the @entity2 family believed tea , coffee and cocoa beverages could serve as an alternative to alcohol , seen to be a cause of poverty and deprivation among the working classes			2
the @entity78 factory was built in 1879 and , in 1893 , as part of the company 's altruistic vision , saw the creation of a 120 - acre village of better housing for its workers			2
however , the company founded in @entity78 , @entity140 , and controversially taken over by @entity141 of the @entity142 in 2010 in a deal worth £ 11.5billion will now have to think again			2
the holding company for the famous @entity146 brand is now called @entity147			2
the court case turned on a technicality and whether the language used by @entity2 in an application to trademark the colour had been clear			1
the three @entity12 judges decided it had not and therefore denied the confectionary company ’s attempt to claim exclusive use of it			2
in the past , @entity9 has been accused of undermining @entity2 products with its @entity65 chocolate bar , which had a similar wrapper			2
a spokesman for the firm said : ‘ we welcome the @entity12 ’s decision to uphold @entity9 ’s objection against @entity147 ’s proposal to trade mark its @entity169 ’ colour across a broad range of products			1
we believe this was the right outcome from a legal perspective			1
’ @entity2 insisted that even if it does not have exclusive use of the particular shade of purple , it will take action against anyone who tries to copy or pass off their products as looking like @entity53			1
a spokesman said : ‘ we are disappointed by this latest decision but it ’s important to point out that it does not affect our long held right to protect our distinctive colour purple from others seeking to pass off their products as @entity2 chocolate			1
‘ our colour purple has been linked with @entity2 for a century and the @entity146 public has grown up understanding its link with our chocolate			1
‘ we are studying this particular ruling and will consider our next steps which includes the possibility of an appeal			2
’ @entity10 , partner and trademark attorney at @entity199 , said : ‘ this is a massive blow to @entity2 and has made it even more difficult for brand owners to obtain trade mark protection for use of a colour			1
‘ seeking colour protection has never been easy or straightforward – it is necessary to demonstrate that consistent use of a specific colour over a period of time has led it becoming recognised as synonymous with the brand			1
' with a heritage dating back to the 1920s , @entity2 had hoped that it had been using the colour purple for long enough			1
