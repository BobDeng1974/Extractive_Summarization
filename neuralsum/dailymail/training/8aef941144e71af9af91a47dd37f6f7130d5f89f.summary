he admitted that he had ' no idea ' who pop singer @entity3 was			1
but when it came to the classics , prince @entity4 was on safer ground			1
the future king and his wife , the @entity9 , enjoyed a tour today of @entity11 in @entity12 , which owns stations including @entity15 's favourite , apparently - @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
in the studio with @entity15 presenter @entity21 the prince admitted that he might have offered some ' gentle persuasion ' when advising the @entity23 on her wedding music			1
' well i might have offered a bit of subtle influence , ' he said archly			2
' do n't forget that @entity54 thought he was remarkable but for some unknown reason he was forgotten			2
i thought this was such a tragedy i wanted to revive interest in his music			2
he is so quintessentially @entity62			0
' @entity4 was so clearly knowledgeable about classical music that he even had presenter @entity21 on the back foot with some of his questions about composers and suites			1
he also asked the presenter : ' can you indulge yourself occasionally by playing a bit of @entity72 ? ' and congratulated him on ' diplomatically ' playing some @entity73 , another of his favourite composers			1
upstairs it was a very different matter as he met @entity41 's @entity42 , however			1
an excited @entity27 tweeted a picture of herself at @entity78 as @entity4 and @entity35 were given a tour @entity4 , who was accompanied on the tour by the @entity9 , spoke about his love of classical music , while the duchess admitted her favourite station was @entity15 politely asking what was currently playing to the station 's seven million listeners , he was told it was @entity90 superstar @entity3 - a revelation which left the prince utterly blank faced			1
downstairs the prince and his wife met some of the network 's well - known presenters including @entity100 show hosts @entity101 and @entity102			0
@entity101 said the prince was ' incredibly ' polite and apologised for keeping him at the station when he and his partner had been up at 4.30am			2
' i could n't believe how concerned he was , what a top man , ' he said			0
' admittedly he knew nothing about the kind of music we played and , as i am so polite , i was n't going to ask him about the @entity116 number one @entity114 and whether he liked it			0
' but i do have it on good authority , from a very good contact of mine , that @entity50 and @entity23 always have capital on in the background when they are at home with little @entity124 , so we do have a royal seal of approval			1
' @entity4 chatted to @entity41 star and former @entity129 @entity128 - and asked her if the girls might reform ' he is always such a lovely man and it was so nice to see him again , ' said @entity128 after meeting the prince @entity4 came face to face with a @entity135 during his visit to the @entity26 , one of the stops on his @entity12 - wide radio station tour miss @entity102 added : ' @entity140 remembered me when i was on @entity141			1
she was such a lovely easy going woman			0
i think she wants to see @entity101 on it in his spandex			0
’ another familiar face was @entity16 dj @entity128 who has met the prince many times in her previous guise as a @entity129			2
‘ he is always such a lovely man and it was so nice to see him again			0
he was asking me about when the @entity129 were going to reunite			0
that puts a bit of pressure on you ! he always asked after the rest of the girls and how they are doing			0
’ her colleague @entity156 added : ‘ i think they were both quite fascinated to see how it all worked behind the scenes			0
they are clearly great radio listeners			2
’ @entity162 , who started her career as a classical musician an now hosts @entity165 , spent several minutes chatting to both the prince and his wife			0
djs @entity168 , left , and @entity169 , right , looked delighted to be presented to their royal guest at the @entity26 today ‘ @entity140 is just lovely and is clearly a listener herself			0
she said when her father was alive he never turned the station off , ’ she said			2
‘ it also turned out that we shared a dressing room at the @entity178 and i had to apologise for not tidying it up			0
i felt mortified ! ’ the couple were out and about visiting radio stations across @entity12 as part of a day to celebrate radio			1
their first visit was to the @entity26 at @entity186 in @entity187 which boasts 10 national and 40 local radio stations as well as the legendary @entity189 which broadcasts in @entity62 and 27 other languages			1
the couple toured the @entity26 newsroom and met with staff at the @entity195 headquarters			0
@entity35 also toured the @entity197 offices , for whom she has pre-recorded a piece , and even viewed a rehearsal in the @entity201 at @entity78			1
