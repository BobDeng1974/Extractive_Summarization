by @entity1 reporter published : 04:53 est , 28 april 2013 updated : 11:27 est , 28 april 2013 with his floppy fringe and sweet , angelic face it is plain to see why his teachers described him as looking like @entity8 's cute younger brother			2
but while most children his age spend their days laughing with friends with nothing more serious to consider than their latest homework assignment , @entity9 is enduring an entirely different reality			0
in 2010 , at the age of 12 , @entity9 , from @entity16 , @entity17 , was sentenced to 25 - years in prison for his part in shooting dead a friend 's stepfather			1
in @entity17 , under extreme circumstances , children as young as 10 can be tried and sentenced in adult courts			1
however it is rare and @entity9 remains one of the youngest ever to be tried in this fashion			0
@entity9 's life was turned upside down on a fateful day in april , 2010 , when he went from an ordinary kid , who had never been in trouble for anything more serious than talking in class and not finishing his homework , to a killer			2
@entity49 life : @entity51 , now 15 , is due to spend three more years in juvenile detention before being moved to @entity17 's notoriously tough adult prison system @entity54 : @entity9 ( left ) was sentenced to 25 years for conspiracy to commit murder			1
with @entity57 ( right ) , then 15 , he shot dead @entity57 's stepfather who they feared would not let them run away to @entity61 @entity9 , an older boy called @entity57 and another 12 - year - old called @entity62 , had planned to run away together			1
but the then 15 - year - old @entity57 had told the other boys that his stepfather @entity64 , would never allow it , so they would have to kill him first			1
@entity57 handed @entity9 a loaded gun and the pair crept through a window into @entity64 's house where they sat in armchairs waiting for him to walk into the room			2
victim : @entity51 was found guilty of conspiring to fatally shoot 49 - year - old @entity74 ( pictured ) the other younger boy @entity62 had refused to go in and had remained outside the house			1
in his original police confession @entity9 described what happened next : ' @entity64 turned the corner and then he ( @entity80 ) shot him			0
i freaked out and closed my eyes and turned around and shot ' , the @entity81 reports			0
the court documents say @entity9 told police he simply went along with his older friend and did n't believe his friend was serious about killing his stepfather			1
but in 2010 @entity9 was sentenced to 25 years in prison , for conspiring to fatally shoot 49 - year - old @entity64			1
in december last year , the @entity90 threw out @entity9 's guilty plea and sentence , saying a juvenile court judge rushed when he waived the case to adult court			1
the appellate court ordered a new hearing to determine if @entity9 should be retried in a juvenile court			0
however it is a massive gamble because if the court decides that @entity9 should be retried as an adult , for the more serious crime of murder , he could be sentenced to 65 years and remain incarcerated until the age of 77			1
as things stand , @entity9 is due to spend the next three years in a juvenile facility before being transferred to @entity17 's notoriously tough adult prison system			1
his attorney , @entity108 , said : ' you really ca n't appreciate just how horrific the adult prison system is unless you 've been there			2
' for the last 30 years i 've been in and out of the adult prison system in the @entity17 and i would n't let my dog go there for a week , much less a 12 - year - old kid			1
' tough life : @entity9 now 15 , has been described as a role model at @entity119 where he is currently incarcerated his harrowing story is the subject of a new documentary by filmmaker @entity123 which is due to be aired on @entity124 later this week			1
@entity9 's mother @entity125 said : ' i 'm in disbelief with the whole thing			2
' surely if you had an adult male or female who had the brain capacity of a 12 - year - old , they would not be tried as an adult			2
' by all reports @entity9 has been a model prisoner			0
he attends school inside the juvenile prison five days a week , where he works hard in the hope that achieving good grades will mean the chance of a good job when he is released			2
his teachers describe him as a role model and one of the best behaved children in the institution			0
his father @entity149 , said : ' i never wanted him to get off scot free			0
he did commit a crime and i do n't want people to see him as a victim because @entity64 was the victim in this case			0
' but you ca n't throw a child in with adults and expect him not to get screwed up			0
' @entity158 : @entity9 , who will be sent to an adult prison before he turns 21 , said he wishes he had just gone home the day he discussed killing the man with two friends in a park @entity9 is now a long way from the floppy - haired 12 - year - old who made that terrible decision three years ago			1
now sporting a crew cut , his grey eyes appear to have lost much of their innocence			0
but incredibly he says he is grateful for what he has ,			0
he says : ' i believe i have matured faster than other kids my age			0
' i 'm starting to think before i act more and not be so impulsive			0
now i 'm more grateful for what i have			0

@entity51 sentenced to 25 - years for shooting a friend 's stepfather
he was tried as an adult and is not due to be released until he is 37
story is the subject of a *gripping* new documentary to be aired this week
