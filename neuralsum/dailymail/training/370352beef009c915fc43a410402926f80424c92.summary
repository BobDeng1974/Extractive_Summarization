@entity0 may believe @entity1 will be fit for their first @entity3 game but a three - week turnaround is pushing it for a meniscus injury			1
the meniscus is a piece of cartilage in the knee that acts as a cushion between the thigh and shin bones			1
from the sound of it , @entity1 has a minor tear			2
normally there are two options to heal this : remove the damaged cartilage or try to repair it			0
cutting out a section is a quicker procedure than repairing it , which can take several months			0
@entity1 is likely to have had only some cartilage removed			2
it can take up to six weeks for a player to recover			1
once the swelling has gone down he will work in the pool and use an @entity31 treadmill to recover the knee movement without putting a lot of weight on it			0
he will probably use a @entity36 â€” a wrap that can compress and ice the knee for long periods at a time			0
with muscle strains , physios have all sorts of tricks up their sleeves but recovering from surgery requires a combination of rest and careful management			0
in the spotlight : @entity1 is mobbed by fans as he leaves hospital following knee surgery swarm : a large crowd gather around @entity1 as he leaves hospital in @entity57 after being operated on the scene : a view of the facade of the @entity62 hospital where @entity1 was operated on			1

@entity0 believe @entity1 will be fit for their first @entity3 2014 match against @entity65
@entity68 *striker* picked up a meniscus injury in training on *wednesday*
despite *undergoing* surgery , such knee injuries can take up to six weeks for a player to recover
