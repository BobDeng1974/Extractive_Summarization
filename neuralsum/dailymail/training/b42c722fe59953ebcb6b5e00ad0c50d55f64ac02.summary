by @entity0 published : 06:49 est , 14 june 2013 updated : 10:48 est , 14 june 2013 @entity3 's new @entity2 passenger jet , a rival to @entity6 's problematic @entity5 , has completed its maiden flight without a hitch			1
watched by more than 10,000 staff and spectators , the aircraft 's curled wingtips sliced into clouds above the @entity3 factory in southwestern @entity15 and flew over the @entity17 mountains , with a crew of six wearing orange jumpsuits and parachutes			2
the flight , with two former fighter pilots at the controls , lasted about four hours and capped eight years of development estimated to have cost $ 15 billion			0
touchdown : the @entity2 lands on the runway by the company 's factory in @entity29 , @entity15 , after a successful maiden flight job done : looking more like astronauts than airline pilots , the new plane 's flight test crew , are applauded after completing the successful flight streamlined : the flight , with two former fighter pilots at the controls , lasted about four hours and capped eight years of development estimated to have cost $ 15 billion ' the airplane is behaving extremely well , ' said @entity41 chief test pilot @entity40 , speaking by radio link from an altitude of 13,000 feet			1
@entity15 co-pilot @entity44 took the controls for the take - off at 10:01 local time ( 0801 gmt ) , giving the plane air under its wings for the first time in front of a podium of airline chiefs who have ordered 613 aircraft			2
it touched down at 14:05 local time , after flying past the @entity29 production site			0
' it is a great day for @entity3			0
a maiden flight does n't happen that often			0
it is not like the auto industry , where you launch a new model every two years or even less , ' said @entity64 , the head of @entity3 parent @entity65			0
speaking by radio link from an altitude of 13,000 feet , @entity41 chief test pilot @entity40 , said the @entity2 was ' behaving extremely well ' timing : the test flight comes three days before the start of the biennial @entity71 , where @entity3 and @entity6 traditionally do battle for aircraft orders efficient : the @entity2 uses light carbon - composite materials instead of aluminium , allowing airlines to make savings on fuel one of the pilots waves from the cockpit window of the new @entity2 after completing the successful maiden test flight the long - awaited sortie is a milestone for @entity3 as it battles against @entity6 's @entity5 for sales of a new generation of lightweight jets made from carbon - plastic material designed to save fuel and open up new long - distance routes			1
@entity6 was quickest off the mark with the revolutionary carbon - composite technology and its @entity5 has outsold the @entity2 with sales standing at 833 aircraft for 57 customers			1
@entity3 hopes to catch up and also mount a challenge to the @entity99 manufacturer 's larger , metallic 777 using a later version of the @entity2			1
@entity3 's ebullient @entity102 - born sales chief , @entity101 , lost no time in talking up the plane 's benefits moments after its @entity106 engines opened up to full power			1
the test flight crew ( @entity110 ) @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity44 , @entity113 , @entity114 and chief test pilot @entity40 wave after the @entity2 touched down @entity116 away ! a view from inside the cockpit shows crew members preparing for take - off crew members sit in the passenger cabin compartment prepare for take - off			1
the aircraft is scheduled to enter service in late 2014 ' did you hear how quiet it was ? we are going to set new standards ... people round airports wo n't even know we are taking off , ' @entity101 said			0
@entity132 , a top @entity134 missile developer who was selected to run the @entity2 programme because of its complexity , smiled broadly but refused to relax			0
' i will still be nervous until it comes back			0
i 'm an engineer so i have to be connected to the ground and make sure everything is fine , ' he said during the flight			0
competition for wide - bodied jets is expected to dominate next week 's @entity71 , where the @entity2 could steal attention with a brief roar over the aviation industry 's largest showcase			2
@entity132 said that @entity3 would soon add a customer in the @entity99 , where industry sources say that @entity170 is negotiating to upgrade and expand an existing order to 35 jets			0
@entity3 initially dismissed the threat posed by the new generation of mid-sized aircraft as it focused on building the world 's largest airliner , the @entity179 superjumbo			0
but faced with burgeoning dreamliner sales , it changed tack and overhauled the design of the @entity2 by adopting similar composites technology in 2006			2
@entity3 plans to offer three variants of the @entity2 , with the smallest , the @entity2 800 , a rival to @entity6 's dreamliner 787 - 9 and 787 - 8 jets the sleek jet with curled wingtips took off with a crew of six wearing parachutes and orange jumpsuits and with tonnes of test equipment on board the high - tech jet , the company 's first all - new plane in eight years , is built primarily from carbon composites and features fly - by - wire technology to boost sales , @entity6 is expected to confirm plans to build a larger version of its @entity5			1
it is also overhauling its 777 with new engines and wings			0
the @entity2 is due to enter service in the second half of 2014 compared with an initial target of 2012 when it was launched as @entity134 's answer to the light - weight @entity5			2
@entity3 plan to offer three variants of the @entity2			2
the @entity2 is designed to compete with @entity6 's 787 - 9 and 787 - 8 @entity212			1
it will have space for 270 passengers with a range of 8,500 nautical miles			0
the two aircraft are almost identical in terms of speed , capacity , range and cost			0
cruising speed : @entity223 @entity224 : 270 ( 3 class configuration ) range : 8,500 nautical miles @entity227 : $ 245.5 million cruising speed : @entity223 capacity : 255 - 290 ( 3 class configuration ) range : 8,000 - 8,500 nautical miles @entity227 : $ 243.6 million delays : the @entity3 construction facilities in @entity232			0
the @entity2 was originally planned to be ready by 2012 the @entity233 , a rival to @entity6 's 777 - @entity235 , is expected to seat 314 passengers in a three - class layout with a range of 8,100 nautical miles			1
@entity6 , still recovering from problems with the lithium batteries on its @entity5 , currently dominates the long - haul market with the 787 and 777			1
' the first flight is a very special moment in an aerospace company , ' @entity64 , ceo of @entity3 's parent company @entity65 , said late thursday			2
@entity3 made the decision to drop @entity248 batteries and switch to traditional nickel - cadmium cells for the @entity2 in the wake of the @entity5 's ' exploding battery ' mystery			1
teething problems : all 50 of @entity6 's @entity212 were grounded following two on - board fires , believed to have been sparked by faulty batteries overheated : the charred battery from the @entity5 plane which made an emergency landing on january 16 in @entity259 , is inspected by the manufacturer at the headquarters of @entity262 in @entity263 , western @entity264 @entity3 said it had taken the decision to prevent further delays in initial deliveries of the @entity2 amid uncertainty over whether investigations into @entity6 's battery problems would lead to a regulation overhaul			1
all 50 of @entity6 's @entity212 were grounded following two on - board fires , believed to have been sparked by faulty batteries			1
industry executives , insurers and safety officials said the technology 's reliability was under heavy scrutiny as investigators struggle to find the cause of incidents that led to the grounding of @entity6 's @entity5 fleet .			2

the high tech @entity2 is @entity3 's first all - new plane in eight years
it completed a four - hour test flight from @entity3 's plant in @entity29 , @entity15
the ultra modern jet uses carbon composites and fly - by - wire technology
@entity3 plans to offer three variants to rival @entity6 's 777 and 787
they *ditched* problematic lithium batteries following dreamliner *debacle*
