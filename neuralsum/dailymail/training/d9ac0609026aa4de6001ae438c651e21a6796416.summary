by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ riathalsam the mystery of why the @entity4 club at the end of the @entity6 is apparently out of reach for an @entity9 manager continues to confuse and irritate @entity10			1
@entity12 ’s boss admitted last week that he was puzzled by @entity14 ’s ongoing absence from the @entity15 , a feeling exacerbated on saturday when @entity18 ’s wonderful goal against @entity19 was sandwiched by two well - taken strikes from @entity21			1
with @entity23 also performing close to his best , and the injured @entity24 yet to receive a call - up , it is not lost on @entity26 that the latest snubs come at a time when @entity9 are crying out for players comfortable in possession			1
overlooked : @entity21 fires his second goal against @entity19 - and third of the season - but the winger is yet to be called up to @entity14 's @entity9 squad technique : @entity18 showed remarkable agility to score against the @entity19 ‘ we all talk about how we want @entity9 to play nice , expansive football , a passing game with attacking football , ’ @entity10 said			1
@entity12 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity42 6 ; @entity43 6 , @entity44 6 , @entity45 6 , @entity46 5.5 ; ki 6.5 , @entity23 7.5 ( @entity47 84 ) ; @entity21 8 , @entity48 6.5 , @entity49 7.5 ( @entity50 66 ) ; @entity51 ( @entity52 76 ) subs not used : @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 manager : @entity10 7 booked : ki scorers : @entity21 2 & 71 , @entity18 ( 4 @entity19 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity61 5.5 ; wisdom 5.5 , @entity63 6.5 , @entity64 5 , @entity65 6 ( @entity66 72 ) ; @entity67 5.5 ( @entity68 46 ) , @entity69 6 ; @entity70 6 , @entity71 6 ( @entity72 72 ) , @entity73 6 ; @entity74 5.5 subs not used : @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 manager : @entity81 5 booked : @entity67 , @entity69 referee : @entity83 ( @entity84 ) @entity85 : @entity21 att : 20,318 ‘ i do feel when we are at our best there are not many better than us in terms of doing that			1
so to have those boys within that team who are @entity93 and performing well does make it strange			0
it is out of our hands			0
the players can only keep doing what they are doing			2
hopefully something comes of it			0
’ for @entity12 , such matters are trifling in comparison to their concerns of last season , when they flirted so close to relegation that @entity101 lost his job			0
@entity26 has reacted to his elevated status by winning his first three @entity111 games of the season , though he continues to talk of the ’ 40 - point mark ’			2
‘ we have had a very good start but that ’s all it is , ’ @entity10 said			0
‘ we are not a @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 or whoever			0
‘ we always want better but we understand what we are , a team that tries to secure @entity111 status as soon as possible and after that we reassess			0
’ @entity19 ’s concerns are perhaps a little more realistic , having started the season without a win and @entity81 ’s 11 signings taking time to settle			2
@entity81 will now lose ‘ 12 or 13 ’ players to international duty at a time when he is desperate to increase his squad ’s cohesion and fitness , and he has put pressure on @entity135 and @entity136 to justify their respective call - ups for @entity72 and @entity138 with playing time			2
international class : @entity10 is bemused why the likes of @entity23 is not in the international squad top form : @entity21 skips around @entity19 keeper @entity61 to give @entity12 an early lead celebration : @entity146 ' players flock around @entity21 after he makes it 3 - 0			1

@entity146 one of only two teams to win their first three games
wins over @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity19 give the @entity4 side a 100 *%* record
but none of @entity26 's players made it into @entity14 's @entity9 squad
confused why @entity21 , @entity18 and @entity23 are being overlooked
@entity21 's *double* and another from @entity18 secured a comfortable 3 - 0 *victory* over @entity19
@entity9 play a *friendly* against @entity169 on *wednesday* before taking on @entity170 for their opening @entity172 *qualifier*
