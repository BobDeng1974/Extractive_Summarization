there are 44,000 male escorts working in the @entity2 but when former glamour model @entity4 tried to interview the @entity2 women who hire them for a new documentary , she could n't find one who would be willing to speak to her			2
but she found the situation was completely different in the @entity10 where women were more open about their desire for casual sex and their willingness to hire an escort to satisfy their needs			2
one of the women @entity19 met for her @entity21 show , @entity20 , which airs this evening , is @entity23 , 46 , from @entity24			1
scroll down video @entity23 , 46 , from @entity24 , hit it off with male escort @entity27 who she hired to go on a date with her she told @entity19 that she was willing to pay $ 2,500 ( £ 1,700 ) for a date with her ' dream man ' following the end of her 15 - year marriage			1
the mother said : ' i am finding men my age have n't taken care of themselves that well , i like younger men			0
' on why she chose to hire a younger man to date rather than seek to meet someone on a dating site or through friends , @entity23 admitted it was because she just wanted to have fun and keep things casual			1
she said : ' i want to get out of the daily grind of my life			0
it 's hard for women to admit we do n't want strings either , we feel an obligation to want more from it			1
' it 's hard to admit to your friends you just want casual sex and a really fun night and not have anything more come of it			1
' @entity19 , right , meets the pair who revealed their date led to a one night stand @entity23 hired male escort @entity27 , a father in a long - term relationship , to go on a date with her to a yoga class followed by drinks and dinner			1
but @entity19 discovered they clicked so well , they stayed the night at a hotel where they had sex			2
male escorts legally ca n't advertise sex for money and websites are carefully worded so women know they are not buying sex but companionship			2
however , as @entity23 discovered , ' extras ' are often on offer if both parties are agreeable			2
appearing on today 's @entity85 with @entity19 , @entity23 told presenters @entity86 and @entity88 that sex was n't top of her agenda when she first hired @entity27 , a 6ft 3 ex-marine			1
she explained : ' hiring a male escort was something i was curious about after getting divorced			1
it served my needs without getting serious			0
i thought of it as a fun adventure			2
' i had an open mind but did n't think it would definitely lead to sex			0
i thought it would be good experience and chance to hang out with good looking man who paid attention to me			2
@entity23 appeared on this morning today via video link as @entity88 , left , asked her why she hired a male escort and @entity19 , right , revealed they could n't get a @entity2 woman to admit the same ' @entity111 he said he thought i was beautiful and was happy i was there			1
i suppose he was paid to say that but it felt really genuine			0
' after spending the night with @entity27 - whose girlfriend condones his employment - @entity23 told @entity19 she would hire him again and would recommend other women do the same if they want a pleasurable night with no strings attached			1
@entity19 told @entity86 and @entity88 she was concerned about how @entity23 would emotionally handle the one night stand she paid for			1
she said : ' she definitely had a real connection with him and i was worried she could fall for him as they clicked so much and had such a great time			0
' @entity19 , 36 , is currently celibate and said on today 's @entity85 she would hire a male escort to join her at a party rather than attending as ' an older single woman on my own ' but @entity23 insisted on @entity85 that she knew what she had signed up for			1
' in this experience i could separate my emotions as i knew what i was involved with , it was what it was , ' she said			0
' we are humans and i thought he was adorable and sweet and we had a physical connection and chemistry but i was n't going to let my heart get involved			0
' i was n't hiring him to fall in love and have kids with him			0
i would do it again and absolutely recommend other women do it if the situation is right and you are emotionally in control of your feelings			0
' @entity19 , 36 , agreed that she would also hire a male escort to accompany her on dates - but as she 's been celibate for the past four years there would be nothing sexual involved			1
@entity19 had to travel to @entity10 to interview women who have paid for sex with male escorts as none in @entity2 were willing to be open about it on @entity19 's @entity21 show , she also meets male strippers , pictured , as well as gigolos and the women who are forgoing dating and relationships for an evening with a professional lover she said : ' i have hired an escort before and i would use one again if i was going to a party rather being an older single woman on my own			1
' women feel threatened by other single women so if you are there with a fella people do n't see you as a threat			0
' the tv presenter , who has also had success as a body builder , said she was n't surprised she had to travel to @entity10 to research her latest documentary after finding nobody in @entity2 willing to admit they hire male escorts			0
she said : ' not a single woman admitted to using them ! we met so many of @entity2 male escorts and they really love their job			0
' @entity2 people are not just reserved , they just do not want to speak openly about anything			0
' @entity4 on women who pay for sex is on @entity21 tonight at 10pm			0

@entity23 , 46 , from @entity24 , paid for date with male escort @entity27
it led to more than just dinner as they had a one night stand
she paid $ 2,500 ( £ 1,700 ) for @entity27 's time
said it was worth it for a fun time with no strings attached
