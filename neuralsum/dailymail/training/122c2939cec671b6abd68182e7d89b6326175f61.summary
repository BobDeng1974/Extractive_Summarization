by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 09:00 est , 7 december 2012 updated : 13:26 est , 7 december 2012 argument : @entity4 arrives at the @entity5 in @entity6 for a hearing to decide whether her son @entity8 should have life - saving radiotherapy treatment a 37 - year - old who took her critically ill seven - year - old son into hiding today denied she was a ' bonkers mother ' and said she ' only wanted the best for her son '			1
@entity4 ran away with her son @entity8 from @entity14 to @entity15 because she thought cancer treatment would ' fry his brain ' , she told the @entity5 in @entity6			1
she believes @entity18 is ' not a sick boy ' and should only be given ' natural remedies ' while he recovers from surgery on a brain tumour , because radiotherapy could ' damage his growth '			1
her lawyer today asked the judge for sympathy , insisting that mrs @entity4 's position was ' principled , reasonable and in the best interests of @entity30 [ her son ] '			1
but doctors said it is ' clearly ' in @entity30 's best interests to have radiotherapy and chemotherapy and today argued that ' the alternative is death '			1
mrs @entity4 said , ' i very much apologise ' , as she gave evidence on the first day of the hearing to decide what treatment @entity8 should have			1
she told the judge that whatever decision the court made , ' i would still like every day to be part of my son 's life			1
i feel i must be part of his care			2
it is very important for me and my son			2
' she fled the house in @entity14 where she and @entity8 were staying on monday and took him to @entity15 to stop him having the life - saving radiotherapy			1
fearing for @entity8 's survival , a judge ordered a nationwide search and allowed the boy 's identity to be released to the media to help track him down			1
the schoolboy is currently staying with his father , @entity67 , while his mother argues over his treatment in court			1
a lawyer representing health authorities treating @entity18 told the court the ' alternative is death '			0
mr @entity75 said @entity8 's illness was the ' stuff of every parent 's nightmare ' and added that he would have to balance what treatment would achieve against the ' downsides '			1
but doctors told that court that without it , the boy 's medulloblastoma tumour may recur and he will die			2
mrs @entity4 said her big fear was @entity18 being left with a lowered iq after the treatment			1
' i want him to have the best quality of life and i fear that radiotherapy could damage and greatly affect his future , ' she told the judge			1
' he has an incredible sense of humour			0
he is a great artist			0
' he has been made out that he is sick and this is not true			0
he is not a sick boy			0
he has done so well since being in hospital			0
' a @entity5 appeal helped locate the pair in @entity114 , @entity115			0
' i was forced into that situation , ' mrs @entity4 told the court			1
' that was the very worst thing i could possibly have done			0
' i was given no choice			0
i thought if i brought him to the hospital they would not let me take him home and proceed with the treatment			0
' @entity124 today told mr @entity75 he hoped for ' much sympathy ' for mrs @entity4 ' position , and pointed to evidence of risks of significantly lowered iqs in those who undergo radiotherapy and chemotherapy , as opposed to chemo alone			1
' such a significant loss of intellectual functioning is a real impairment to quality of life , particularly in the world @entity18 is likely to inhabit as an adult , ' he said in court documents			0
but @entity142 barrister @entity141 argued that radiotherapy has been the norm for medulloblastoma patients since the 1950s and before that ' all patients died '			2
' alternatives such as omitting radiotherapy and using chemotherapy only are associated with significantly poorer survival rates , ' she told the court in written arguments			2
seriously ill : @entity103 , pictured , has been receiving alternative therapies as he recovers from surgery to remove a brain tumour ' if a balancing exercise assessing the proposed treatment is conducted , on the positive side of the scales is the fact that prompt treatment , involving radiotherapy and chemotherapy , leads to a high chance of recovery			1
' since with no additional therapy medullablastoma will recur , the alternative is death			0
' mrs @entity4 claimed last night in court that a doctor told her radiotherapy would ‘ fry his brains ’			1
high court judge @entity176 made the extremely rare ruling that @entity8 could be named in an attempt to find him after his father mr @entity103 , 34 , became concerned at having not heard from his wife and son in four days			1
police and social workers took @entity18 from his mother shortly after 1.30am yesterday in @entity114			2
he was temporarily placed into foster care and then given to his father , who is separated from @entity8 ’s mother and lives in @entity6			1
but mrs @entity4 said she was out of contact because she was in @entity15 taking @entity18 for treatment in an oxygen chamber and does not carry a mobile phone in case it affects his health			1
neon ’s brain tumour was reportedly removed in full during surgery on october 25 – immediately after he was diagnosed with the aggressive medulloblastoma form of cancer			2
doctors then wanted to carry out the standard procedure of treating him with radiation to remove any further cancer cells and reduce the chances of the disease recurring			1
however , mrs @entity4 , from @entity207 , @entity208 , claims that when a doctor , he referred to the procedure as ‘ frying his brains ’			1
‘ i lost all confidence in him , ’ she said			0
‘ it was frightening and very unprofessional			0
i thought , they have got the whole tumour out so why are they frying his brain ? ‘ i fear they are going to fry my son ’s brain when there are other ways we could proceed			2
i feel it is very unnecessary and i ’m sure any mother who had researched like i have would feel the same			2
‘ this is my only son			2
i need to be able to tell him i did everything i could for him			0
’ @entity4 says that she fears radiotherapy will permanently harm @entity8 's brain , affecting his iq mrs @entity4 , who is originally from @entity233 , added that she fears radiotherapy will permanently damage @entity30 's growth and future fertility			1
she wants to see if the tumour returns before resorting to radiation			0
she said : ‘ if i truly believed he had cancer now in his body i would agree to go ahead			0
but they are going after one cell that might be there			0
i am convinced it is not there because of the scans and because his spinal fluid is clear			0
‘ i do n’t want to fry his brain and have his quality of life ruined just on the off chance there is a floating cell that is going to multiply			0
‘ all i ’m doing is protecting my child			0
i ’m doing what any mother would do			2
’ @entity8 has undergone a range of alternative therapies since his operation , including hours in an oxygen tank			1
mrs @entity4 will not allow mobile phones near @entity263 in case they damage his health , feeding him a diet of organic foods and juices			1
she is well - known in music circles and has performed as @entity271 at venues ranging from @entity273 to @entity274 in @entity6			0
her parents , @entity276 and @entity277 , who live in @entity278 , @entity14 , said they support their daughter ’s decision			2
doctors disagree with mrs @entity4 ' decision to use only natural medicine and have started legal proceedings mrs @entity277 , 72 , added : ‘ @entity285 is the most caring , wonderful mother			1
she is totally dedicated to her children			0
everything she is doing is what she believes is in @entity263 ’s best interests			0
‘ she wants to work with [ the doctors ] but the medical profession want to do it all their way			2
one of the doctors scared the living daylights out of her , referring to it as “ frying his brains ”			0
' that is something you do n’t say to a mother whose child has just been diagnosed with a brain tumour			0
’ mr @entity103 , an it consultant from @entity305 , west @entity6 , and the son of @entity308 actor @entity307 , described his estranged wife as a ‘ concerned mother ’ , but added : ‘ i want to make sure [ @entity30 ] has everything available to him			1
i understand there are lots of things that can be done to minimise the effects of radiotherapy			0
’ the hearing continues and the judge is expected to give his ruling tomorrow .			0
