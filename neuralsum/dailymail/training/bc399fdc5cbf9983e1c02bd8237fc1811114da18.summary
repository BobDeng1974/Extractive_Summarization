a school in @entity1 has banned students from wearing skirts in an attempt to crack down on ' immodest ' clothing styles , after giving up on the struggle to stop girls from shortening their skirts			1
from september , both boys and girls at @entity10 will have to wear trousers			1
the decision has been described as ' ridiculous ' and ' poorly thought out ' by parents , residents and local council officials			1
@entity10 has been caught up in controversy following their ruling that later this year they will be banning students from wearing skirts in their school @entity10 , @entity1			1
the school has taken the decision to ban female pupils from wearing skirts , they will only be allowed to wear trousers in addition to banning all skirts , the governors also backed the school 's decision to ban make - up for pupils in years 7 - 11 ; which consists of children aged 10 to 16			1
the decision to ban skirts was floated by a group of governors , pupils and staff , who met last year as part of a focus group on school uniform			1
head teacher dr @entity41 , who claims that the tendency for some girls to shorten their skirts has led to the ban headteacher @entity41 said : ' girls already wear trousers at @entity10			1
' the reason the school is making this compulsory is the tendency for some girls to wear really short skirts			1
' hemlines have risen to a level that is both impractical as well as immodest			2
' inevitably , this decision is popular with some parents and not with others			2
' dr @entity41 said : ' the same responses would be true for pupils			0
' financial support will be offered to parents to support this transition			1
' a @entity66 spokesman said : ' in terms of uniform policy that is not something we administer , it is purely down to the school to make that decision			2
' councillor @entity74 , a former teacher , spoke out against the ban			0
she said : ‘ i think that setting rules and regulations is good for parents and students , adhering to them is preparation for life			2
' we lost shirts and ties to polo shirts and sweatshirts thus lowering standards			0
' they should be maintaining the rules that have been successful in the past , like monitoring skirt lengths , rather than an overall ban			0
councillor @entity74 originally spoke out on twitter , raising questions and pointing out problems with the practicality of the ban ' by not conforming to rules and regulations in something like the length of a skirt can lead at a later date to disregard for rules / law and order and may encourage anti social behaviour			0
‘ what if there are parents or students who are against wearing trousers for religious reasons ? ' what happens when it gets to summer and girls no longer want to wear trousers in the heat ? are they going to have to wear shorts ? ‘ i wonder has the school really thought this through			1
’ local parents and residents have also spoken out against the prospective ban			1
@entity122 , 26 , said : ' i do n’t know if i agree with it			0
i see teenage girls walking round with tiny skirts but i do n’t know if you can ban them from wearing them			2
' @entity127 said : ' i think they should be able to wear skirts so long as they are not really short			1
' i would restrict the length of them so they looked respectable			0
' @entity127 , of @entity134 , who has been vocally opposed to the ban ( left ) and @entity136 , who is on the fence about the decision ( right ) @entity139 , 56 , said : ' it is ridiculous			2
i think it is silly to ban them at school because it is free choice , is n’t it ? ' as long as the skirt is of a certain length then i think they should be able to wear skirts			2
' but unfortunately i think the rules are not being adhered to and some of the skirts are not skirts			0
' @entity153 , 49 , said : ' it seems unfair to me			0
' you are doing something that is penalising girls			0
' the decision has sparked outrage from some parents and students , but others have agreed with the policy , branding the short skirts ' immodest ' @entity165 , 44 , said : ' i like girls to look like girls			1
i like the feminine side of wearing a skirt as part of a uniform			0
' i used to have the trouser option , but i always chose the skirt because it is more feminine			0
' unfortunately , the way children wear uniforms nowadays is inappropriate			0
i am not sure how i would enforce having a certain length of skirt that had to be adhered to			0
' the trend of short skirts has been popular for ages , with recent films like @entity183 , and provocative advertising campaigns making the style even more popular in recent years			1
the typical fabric used to make school skirts makes them very easy to adjust , with methods of adjustment ranging from simple sewing techniques to rolling up the skirts at the waist to make them shorter .			0

@entity10 called short skirts ' immodest ' and ' impractical '
girls will now be forced to wear trousers instead of skirts
financial support will be offered to parents to help the *change*
decision has caused outrage amongst local parents and residents
