by @entity0 last updated at 12:34 pm on 15th december 2011 @entity2 is ramping up its nuclear programme in an underground bunker deep inside a mountain , diplomatic sources revealed today			1
@entity2 experts have carried out the necessary preparations at @entity8 near the holy city of @entity10			1
it paves the way for the @entity14 state to begin higher - grade uranium enrichment at the site on a former military base			1
mobbed : @entity2 president @entity18 gets a hero 's welcome as he arrives in @entity21 , around 1,000 miles south of @entity22 today playing the crowd : president @entity18 is cheered by supporters in a stadium in @entity27 v for victory : president @entity18 enjoys the acclaim the machines , equipment and nuclear material needed have been transferred and installed at @entity8 , the sources added			1
they suggested the work itself - until now conducted above ground at another location - could start when @entity2 takes the decision			2
it coincides with a period of escalating tension between @entity44 powers and president @entity18 after a @entity39 nuclear watchdog report last month said @entity22 appeared to have worked on designing a nuclear weapon , and that secret research may continue			1
the @entity47 and its @entity49 allies have seized on the unprecedented document by the @entity51 to ratchet up the sanctions pressure on @entity2 , one of the world 's largest oil producers			2
this satellite image shows a facility under construction inside a mountain located about 20 miles north northeast of @entity10 , @entity2 enriched uranium can be used to fuel power plants , which is @entity2 's stated aim , or provide material for atomic bombs if processed much further , which the @entity66 suspects is the country 's ultimate intention			1
a rare visit by @entity2 's intelligence chief to @entity72 sought to refute @entity47 claims that @entity22 planned to kill the kingdom 's ambassador to @entity75 , a senior @entity2 official said today			1
@entity77 spokesman @entity76 said @entity2 also wanted to convince @entity72 that the @entity47 and @entity78 are seeking to sow seeds of discord between the two regional powers			0
intelligence minister @entity82 was reported to have met the @entity72 crown prince nayef bin @entity83 during his visit yesterday			1
the prince is also the kingdom 's interior minister			0
initially , few reports emerged from the meeting			0
@entity72 diplomats , speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to reporters , said the two discussed regional issues , including developments in @entity97 and @entity98			0
@entity2 has dismissed the @entity47 accusations that @entity22 was involved in a plot to assassinate @entity101 , calling the claims ' absurd			0
' proliferation expert @entity103 noted that @entity2 earlier this year announced it would shift its most sensitive enrichment activity to @entity105 but that the actual start would still be significant			1
' obviously , for people who are concerned about @entity2 's ability to break out and to enrich to weapons - grade this is a pretty good step along that route , ' said @entity103 , of the @entity112			0
@entity2 's decision last year to raise the level of some enrichment from the 3.5 per cent purity needed for normal power plant fuel to 20 per cent worried @entity44 states that saw this as bringing it significantly closer to the 90 per cent needed for a bomb			2
@entity2 says the material will help fuel a research reactor			2
@entity2 's main enrichment plant is located near the central town of @entity125			2
but the country said in june it would shift its higher - grade activity to @entity8 , offering better protection from any military attack , and also sharply boost output capacity			0
' if conditions require , we will move ( our ) uranium enrichment facilities to safer locations , ' said the @entity137 's anti-sabotage chief @entity135			1
@entity2 's main uranium enrichment site in @entity125 in central @entity2 is built partly underground while the long - secret @entity140 facility was built deep inside a mountain as a precaution from aerial attacks			1
@entity144 said the existing infrastructure has already been ' a kind of deterrent ' against attacks			0
' our vulnerability in the nuclear field is minimal , ' @entity135 claimed			0
' if @entity47 and @entity78 were able to attack and harm our nuclear facilities , they would have definitely done so by now			0
' @entity135 's unit was set up on an order from @entity2 's @entity156 ayatollah @entity155 , and is tasked with reducing the possibility and minimizing damage from potential military action against @entity2			0
@entity125 is of key concern since it is the country 's main enrichment site and the location of the bulk of its centrifuges - machines that are used for enriching uranium in a technology that can produce either fuel for power plants or fissile material for a nuclear warhead			1
suspect site : a general view of the @entity176 heavy - water project , 120 miles southwest of @entity22 a @entity39 nuclear watchdog report last month said @entity22 appeared to have worked on designing a nuclear weapon @entity125 computers have been the target of a cyber attack in 2009 and experts there have had to battle a powerful computer worm known as @entity185 , which has the ability to send centrifuges spinning out of control			2
@entity2 acknowledged @entity185 affected a limited number of centrifuges at @entity125 but said its scientists discovered and neutralized the malware before it could cause serious damage			0
@entity135 did not elaborate on possible sites for the relocation of nuclear facilities but such an effort would be hugely complicated and would require places able to store the technology safely			0
in august , @entity2 announced it was moving some of its centrifuges to @entity140 , just north of the holy city of @entity10 , because that site offered better protection from possible airstrikes but did not later elaborate on the move or say whether the centrifuges came from @entity125			1
the @entity47 and @entity78 , @entity2 's arch foes , have not ruled out military action if diplomacy fails to resolve the long - running nuclear dispute , which has the potential to spark a wider conflict in the @entity213 .			0

machines and uranium enrichment material moved to underground site
move likely to add to tension with the @entity66
