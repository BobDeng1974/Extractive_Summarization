one in five cases now involve women in this age bracket , while the rate is still climbing among older women			0
experts fear modern lifestyles are to blame for the rise among younger women			0
many are drinking excessively , overeating and failing to exercise – all habits which contribute to breast cancer			1
the growing trend for women to delay having children until their 30s and 40s , have smaller families and breastfeed for short periods of time , if at all , also pushes up the risk , claims @entity28			2
the charity suggested that increasing use of the contraceptive pill may also play a role in the rise			1
breast cancer kills around 12,000 women annually , but more than ever before are surviving due to advances in treatment			1
in women under 50 the death rate has almost halved in the last 20 years			0
@entity39 , chief executive of @entity40 , said : ‘ although breast cancer is more common in older women , it ’s worrying to see an increase in the number of younger women diagnosed with the disease			1
‘ more women than ever are surviving which is great news , however more women are getting breast cancer and we must invest in vital research for new treatments and disease prevention			1
’ statistics released by @entity28 show that around 7,700 women under 50 were diagnosed with breast cancer in 1995 in the @entity58 , but the figure had risen to 10,068 in 2010			1
the increase in breast cancer in women of all ages over the same period was 18 per cent			1
in younger women , a family history of the disease increases the risk			0
but experts are concerned about changing lifestyle patterns among younger women , with many choosing to have children later or remain childless , which boosts the risk			0
pregnancy before the age of 30 and breastfeeding cuts a woman ’s lifetime number of menstrual cycles , thereby reducing overall exposure to oestrogen , a hormone which drives most breast cancer tumours			2
previous research suggests women who breastfeed for six months reduce their risk of dying of cancer by ten per cent , possibly by a direct effect on breast cells making them more resistant to cancer			0
age remains the strongest factor for breast cancer , with a healthy lifestyle cutting risk at any age			2
scientists estimate four out of every ten cases in the @entity58 could be prevented through maintaining a healthy weight , drinking less alcohol and being more physically active			0

( @entity107 posed by model , left ) ; right , breast cancer cells women who are overweight or obese run a higher risk of developing the disease , probably through changes in sex hormone levels triggered by weight gain			2
studies show drinking just one large glass of wine a day increases the chances of developing breast cancer by a fifth			2
@entity28 says the contraceptive pill slightly increases the risk while women are taking it , and it has become more popular			1
@entity125 , the charity ’s director of health information , said : ‘ the number of cases in women under 50 diagnosed with breast cancer is increasing slowly , but thanks to research , awareness and improved care , more women than ever before are surviving the disease			1
‘ women of all ages who notice anything different about their breasts , including changes in size , shape or feel , a lump or thickening , nipple discharge or rash , dimpling , puckering or redness of the skin , should see their gp straight away , even if they have attended screening			0
‘ it ’s more likely not to be cancer but if it is , detecting it early gives the best chance of successful treatment			0
’ @entity159 of the @entity160 said : ‘ this increase in cases among younger women is a pattern evident across all ages			0
‘ it is vital that the particular concerns of younger women , such as fertility issues as a result of treatment , are addressed and that specialist support is provided by clinicians			0
‘ apart from being a woman , age still remains the biggest risk factor for breast cancer , with 80 per cent of cases in women over the age of 50			2
however , no matter what their age , all women need to be breast aware			0

drinking to excess , overeating and no exercise are contributing factors
@entity28 claims rise in use of contraceptive pill is also a reason
