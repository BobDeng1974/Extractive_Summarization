and @entity6 , 38 , had to think extra quickly while helping his girlfriend @entity7 , 31 , when she went into labour in the couple 's bedroom on sunday night , because baby @entity12 had the umbilical cord wrapped around his tiny neck			1
but having already delivered @entity12 's brother @entity15 on the family sofa in 2006 , @entity6 , from @entity17 , @entity18 , was able to react calmly , carefully untying the cord and pulling @entity20 to safety			1
@entity6 with his sons @entity15 , six , and new baby @entity20 , both of whom he delivered at home without paramedic assistance @entity6 realised paramedics were not going to arrive in time after he dialled 999 when @entity7 began having close contractions , and was forced to deliver 7lb 4oz @entity20 on the couple 's bed at 11.10pm			1
the delighted father - of - two , said despite the hiccup with the umbilical cord , his latest delivery was much easy than the first			1
he said : ' everything happened so quickly that i ca n't really remember much about it			0
@entity7 said she was n't going to make it to the hospital , so i just went into auto - pilot			2
it was all a bit of a shock			0
' it took barely two minutes before @entity20 was out , the moment he popped out the paramedics were at the door			0
' the first time it happened i was scared , but having been through that it was n't so bad a second time			0
i never thought in a million years i would be delivering another baby ! ' the delighted father - of - two , said despite the hiccup with the umbilical cord , his latest delivery was much easy than the first @entity7 had been having contractions through the day and went upstairs to rest			1
@entity6 told her to let him know if anything happened but she had barely reached the top of the staircase when she shouted that the baby was coming			2
' he came out so fast i just delivered him there and then on the bed , ' @entity6 said			2
' then i saw that the chord was wrapped round his neck and i knew that was dangerous , i had to gently try and free him or he might have died			0
' he 's a beautiful baby , perfectly healthy despite me delivering him , but i 'm just glad i had some experience in delivering him			0
' @entity6 said : ' he 's a beautiful baby , perfectly healthy despite me delivering him , but i 'm just glad i had some experience in delivering him ' @entity7 added : ' we called the hospital at about 10.30pm to say we were on our way , but suddenly i knew we were n't going to be able to get there			1
my mum came and rang an ambulance , but @entity20 just came out so quick			0
' delivering a baby at home was a bit of a shock for @entity6 when it happened the first time , but not so much this time			1

we were all fine afterwards and @entity20 has been really good			0
' @entity12 's grandmother @entity83 , 55 , from @entity84 , @entity85 , said : ' i 'm dead proud of @entity6 - he did really well			1
there are n't many dads who can say they have delivered both their children			0
