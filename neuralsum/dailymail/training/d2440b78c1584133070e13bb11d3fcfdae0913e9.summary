by @entity0 a literary magazine launched a scathing @entity3 attack on the @entity4 for its alleged use of ' torture ' techniques just hours after the agency launched its first official account			1
the organisation sent its first tweet on friday with a humorous post saying ' we can neither confirm nor deny that this is our first tweet			2
' but two hours later the official @entity3 account of the @entity16 posted a succession of nine tweets taking the agency to task on accusations that they use controversial interrogation techniques			1
the @entity16 sent their first tweet , bottom post , just two hours after the @entity4 set up their official @entity3 account the first tweet , which was directed at the agency 's twitter handle @ @entity4 linked to a blog post on their website from earlier this year by @entity33 , which discusses the @entity4 's alleged interference with a @entity37 torture investigation			1
what followed was then a barrage of eight posts fired off in quick succession linking to a 2007 report by the @entity43 , the report was on the ' treatment of @entity46 ’ in @entity47 ' , which came to light in 2009 in a @entity16 article by @entity50			1
the magazine 's account continued to send the tweets in quick succession , linking to a report about the @entity4 's alleged use of torture but despite their persistence , the @entity4 did not reply to any of the tweets , which take aim at the agency 's alleged controversial history			1
the @entity4 launched the social media account on friday and even though they were hesitant to reveal their identity , @entity3 did it for them by verifying their account			2
the infamously secretive organisation then let hundreds of thousands into the fold at an astonishing rate			0
about 30 minutes after the account went live , they had 26,900 followers ; that number doubled in the next 10 minutes and it continued to rise ever since			0
a total of nine tweets aimed at the @entity4 were sent but the intelligence agency did not reply to any of them @entity77 , the editor of the @entity16 , which took the @entity4 to task on @entity3 they are currently sitting at 582,000 followers even though they have only sent three tweets			1
the social media account is just the latest attempt by the federal government to improve transparency within the nation 's intelligence programmes			0
their practices came under severe scrutiny last summer when consultant @entity89 leaked thousands of documents proving that the @entity91 was running a massive phone and email surveillance programme			0
the @entity4 launched their @entity3 account on friday as part of a government - wide effort to be more transparent the @entity98 approved the launch of a @entity100 called @entity101 ( @entity102 ) @entity103 last august as the first step in winning back some public support			2
that site , and the associated @entity3 account , has been used to release documents and statements pertaining to news matters when they occur			0
most recently , the @entity91 used @entity101 @entity103 to release the only email they claim to have from @entity89 , which theoretically contradicts a claim he made in a televised interview .			0
