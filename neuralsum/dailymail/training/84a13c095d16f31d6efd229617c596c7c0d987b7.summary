she is the woman accused of dumping her day - old baby down a drain and leaving him to die			1
but the 30 - year - old is also a loving auntie who adores children and appears entirely devoted to her family in @entity7 and @entity8 , @entity9 can reveal			1
one of her social media accounts - filled with pictures of babies and young relatives - suggests that she became increasingly clucky as her pregnancy progressed			1
it is a stark contrast with the savage act with which she is charged , the attempted murder of her baby boy , who miraculously survived five days in a concrete stormwater drain off a @entity23 motorway			1
postings on social media in the days after she dumped her son , but before the baby was found and alleged crime was detected , show her posing and looking pretty in a dress but also experiencing post-natal tiredness			1
a family friend has told @entity9 that the young woman - who goes by an anglicised nickname and works in western @entity23 - ' loves children and is very good with children '			1

she will appear in court on december 10 by video link from a @entity23 women 's prison distraught : the @entity82 of the woman accused of attempting to kil her own child is comforted on @entity85 ( above ) by relatives and friends who appear distraught and still bewildered at the events saved : the moment the baby boy is retrieved by senior - constable @entity93 from the stormwater drain and handed to paramedics in western @entity23 last sunday , five days after his 30 - year - old mother allegedly left him for dead the one day old baby boy was pushed through the tiny opening of this stormwater drain ( pictured ) in western @entity23			1
if recent rains had been about , the newborn might have drowned according to police , the woman had been living with her aunt and uncle in @entity103 in @entity23 's west when she became pregnant and kept her condition secret for nine months			2
after giving birth to a healthy baby boy in a western @entity23 hospital at 1am on tuesday of last week , she discharged herself early that afternoon and , police allege , took her baby and placed him in a stormwater drain around 500m from her home			2
the baby was apparently put through a small opening under the concrete slab over the drain and fell the 2.5m drop to the bottom			0
the accused woman lived in this @entity103 house with her relatives ( pictured ) during the nine months of her secret pregnancy five days later , last sunday morning , @entity123 and his daughter @entity124 , heard a crying sound coming from a drain as they cycled on the @entity128 and , thinking it was a kitten , discovered the baby boy miraculously alive			1
police from @entity132 retrieved the baby , which was wrapped in a pink striped blanket , from the drain			0
the drain was covered by a concrete slab which weighed over 200kg and took six people to lift , including two police officers who had arrived at the scene			0

he said she ' was trying to keep on top of things ' while incarcerated in a @entity23 jail , believed to be @entity160			2
he described her as a ' very happy person ' who was ' very good around children and young people at the church '			1
he said that she is ' a quiet girl ' but that ' she 's an island girl , so she 's got a bit of bite in her ' and that might help her cope while in prison awaiting trial for attempted murder			2
he said the reason she hid the pregnancy was less about the church and for ' cultural reasons ' to do with the traditional @entity8 community , but he believed the father of the child was @entity8 and had ' perhaps moved away '			1
the woman , whose case was heard briefly in @entity182 on friday , is expected to appear via audio visual link from jail in december			0
relatives of the accused woman ( pictured leaving @entity187 last week ) are distraught and confused about the events leading up to the 30 - year - old allegedly dumping her newborn son in a drain the accused woman 's aunt ( pictured , left ) said she did not know who the father of her niece 's baby could be court documents state the child was placed in the 2.4 - metre deep drain on tuesday - less than 24 hours after he was born at @entity201			1
