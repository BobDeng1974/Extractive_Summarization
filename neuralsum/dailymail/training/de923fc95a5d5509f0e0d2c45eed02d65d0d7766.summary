by @entity0 unemployed people who make a ' lifestyle choice ' to live on benefits without bothering to seek work will face a crackdown from next year , @entity1 has announced			1
the @entity7 has warned that anyone who refuses to seek work will have ' no hiding place ' under his reforms			1
today , in an article written for the @entity12 , he goes on to insist that looking for work should be a ' full - time job ' in itself			1
@entity1 says anyone who refuses to seek work will have ' no hiding place ' and he reveals that from 2014 , thousands of jobless people who are ' lacking motivation ' will be forced to spend 35 hours a week applying for work			1
he says : ' this will make it crystal clear that looking for work requires as much effort and commitment as a full - time job – and that jobseekers should think of themselves as in work to find work			1
' the minister adds that the decision to claim unemployment benefits should no longer be ' a lifestyle choice '			2
mr @entity1 also makes clear that the government remains unbowed by recent controversy over the introduction of @entity32 as well as the cuts to housing benefit for claimants with spare rooms – the so - called ' bedroom tax '			2
and he writes : ' i 'm not going to say “ job done ”			2
we 've made great strides in fixing the system , but there is more to do			0
that includes asking for more from jobseekers			0
' mr @entity1 recognises that most jobseekers ' are determined to get a job ' and pledges to help those who are genuinely searching for work			2
unemployed people who make a ' lifestyle choice ' to live on benefits without bothering to seek work will face a crackdown from next year but he says that there should be ' no hiding place ' for people who ' wo n't play by the rules '			1
at october 's @entity58 conference , mr @entity1 announced that there were plans to make some jobless attend ' full - time mandatory attendance centres '			1
he said the plans for enforced full - time job searches would be aimed at the long - term unemployed and those suspected of working in the black economy , who earn cash in hand rather than searching for legitimate jobs			1
today , he has made it clear that the new system will also be targeted at unemployed people who lack ' the motivation ' to find work			1
@entity76 sources say that those who ca n't be bothered to look for work will be identified early by job centre staff			2
they will have to enrol in a full - time job search before they are referred to the @entity79 – the @entity29 scheme to provide support , work experience and training to the unemployed			1
addressing his critics , mr @entity1 insists in his article that it is ' a complete nonsense ' to suggest that the government has removed the welfare safety net			0
and he vows to continue rolling out @entity32 , which will replace most out - of - work benefits with a single payment , despite having to delay the full introduction of the plans until 2017			1
making a virtue of the delay , mr @entity1 says the scheme will be rolled out across the country ' carefully and safely over the next four years '			0
he goes on to say that he believes the slower time frame should help avoid the ' costly mistakes ' that @entity100 made introducing schemes ' in a “ big bang ” approach '			2
mr @entity1 last week revealed that the welfare cap of £ 26,000 per household has pushed 250 people into work every week			1
government figures show that almost half of those affected by the benefit limit are now back in work			2
and since april , adults in 19,000 households who have had their benefits capped have taken up jobs			0
some 1,300 of these households now claim £ 200 less a week than they did before the cap			0
and another 51 households are claiming £ 400 less under the new rules			0
previously these claimants could have been receiving £ 46,000 from the government each year			0
by @entity1 secretary of state for work and pensions @entity1 writing in today 's @entity12 the last @entity29 left us with a hopelessly broken welfare system – one that trapped people on benefits , and paid some people more in benefits than other hardworking people received for doing an honest day 's work			1
on @entity100 's watch , welfare spending spiralled out of control , increasing by over 60 per cent – at a cost of £ 3,000 for every @entity138 household			0
that is why this year we have introduced a cap on the amount of benefits that people who are out of work can receive – and ended the madness whereby millions of people have been stuck on benefits because taking a job would actually make them worse off			1
we are making sure you 're always better off in work than on benefits			2
these policies give claimants a real incentive to find work , and around 19,000 who would potentially have been subject to the benefit cap have already moved into work			2
we have also limited the annual increase for most working age benefits to 1 per cent – saving another £ 500million this year alone			0
in april we launched @entity32 which will merge six benefits into one and make it easier for claimants to move off benefits and into work			2
it 's up and running in seven areas of the country , and will roll out across the country carefully and safely over the next four years , avoiding the costly mistakes @entity100 made introducing schemes in a ' big bang ' approach			0
however , while the economy 's turning a corner and we 've seen a record 30million people in work , i 'm not going to say ' job done '			1
we 've made great strides in fixing the system , but there 's more to do			0
that includes asking for more from jobseekers			0
i know most jobseekers are determined to get a job , and we give them all the support they need to realise this aspiration			0
but there must be no hiding place for those who wo n't play by the rules			1
by spring , every @entity187 in the country will be signing new jobseekers up to the @entity190 , which sets out clear actions to complete each week in return for their benefit			0
and next year , i will trial a new scheme that will require 6,000 jobseekers to spend 35 hours a week at a supervised jobsearch centre			0
people who have been out of work for several years or those who are lacking motivation will be required to spend up to six months looking for and applying for jobs in return for their benefits			1
this will make it crystal clear that looking for work requires as much effort and commitment as a full - time job – and that jobseekers should think of themselves as in work to find work			1
claiming unemployment benefits is no longer a lifestyle choice			0
fair to claimants and fair to the taxpayer – those are the changes we 're making			0
we ca n't fix the welfare system overnight , but we 're getting there .			0
