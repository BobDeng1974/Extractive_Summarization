@entity0 said the poll tax was dead so outstanding debts should be written off @entity0 yesterday wrote off more than £ 400million in unpaid poll tax payments in a final act of ‘ financial irresponsibility ’			1
the first minister ’s ‘ tax - dodger ’s charter ’ stunned local authority chiefs , who want to chase up the debts and spend the cash on vital services			1
critics fear the amnesty is a cynical bid to appease pro-independence voters who risk being caught by the authorities after registering to vote for the first time in the referendum			0
with an additional £ 1billion outstanding in council tax payments , mr @entity0 ’s shock decision – one of the last before he resigns next month - could create a precedent that would leave public finances in chaos			1
it will also infuriate law - abiding @entity26 who paid their poll tax payments , despite the policy ’s widespread unpopularity			1
at a baffling briefing session with journalists yesterday afternoon , mr @entity0 ’s spokesman said @entity36 ’s community charge – as it was officially known – was ‘ dead ’ so the debts should now be ignored			1
he argued that sums recouped in recent years have fallen to just £ 400,000 , but council chiefs wanted to improve on that by combing the new electoral roll to catch those who had dropped off the radar			2
the historic vote on @entity26 's future saw a surge in registrations , with 120,000 in the final six weeks alone , as people formed unprecedented queues outside town halls			2
according to the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) , @entity26 still owe £ 425million in unpaid poll tax bills			1
the @entity26 @entity52 understands that councils may be handed a small one - off £ 350,000 compensation sum – less than 0.1 per cent of the outstanding total			2
the organisation ’s furious president , @entity56 , said : ‘ whatever you think of the substantive issue … this is one of the oddest decisions ever to have come out of the @entity62			0
‘ just look at the hard facts			0
up until two days ago the policy of local government , fully backed up by @entity66 reports and the @entity62 , was crystal clear : @entity66 ’s councils were under a very strict obligation to collect every penny of outstanding debt owed to us			2
‘ indeed , we have been told in the past that until we did this , we should not be asking for any additional money from @entity62			0
‘ it seems very odd that now we have an improved tool at our disposal in the form of an expanded electoral register that may help us maximise collection rates , it is the self - same government that tells us they are going to legislate immediately to prevent us from using it			0
’ he accused the government of ‘ rushing with obscene haste to new legislation ’ , adding : ‘ @entity50 is very sensitive to the requirement to increase political engagement and electoral registration but everybody recognises that becoming involved in the political process demands responsibility as well as rights			0
‘ in @entity50 ’s view , you can not have one without the other			0
if that is not an accepted principle , we are very worried about the precedent that writing off this debt would create			0
’ the ‘ community charge ’ was introduced a year early north of the @entity103 , sparking widespread opposition and an organised campaign of non-payment in 1989			1
around 700,000 summary warrants for non-payment were issued after the first year , but @entity36 refused to change course and the tax was introduced in @entity112 in 1990			1
disgraced former msp @entity113 was the first person in @entity114 to be jailed over the tax , while a series of protests brought about the policy ’s end in 1993			2
@entity36 's poll tax sparked protests across @entity26 - including this 1990 march in @entity121 mr @entity0 said yesterday : ‘ the poll tax was a hated levy , which poured untold misery on communities across @entity26			1
‘ it was a hugely discredited tax , even before it was brought in – and it was rightly consigned to history just four years after its introduction in @entity26			0
‘ it is therefore not appropriate for councils to use current electoral records to chase arrears from decades ago			0
’ he added : ‘ it is , of course , quite proper for councils to use current information to assess current council tax liability			0
unlike the long dead , discredited poll tax , the council tax is a live levy which forms a key part of local authorities ’ finances			1
’ his spokesman was asked what will happen to outstanding council tax payments if the tax is abolished under @entity149 proposals for a ‘ local income tax ’			1
struggling to answer , he said there will be a consultation on the suggested local income tax			2
@entity26 conservative welfare reform spokesman @entity155 said : ‘ this can only count as a write - off if all councils are fully reimbursed for the money they have not yet received			0
‘ there is many a person in @entity26 who paid this tax in good faith , and they have ended up subsidising those who can afford to pay but chose not to			0
are those hardworking people going to be reimbursed too under this initiative ? ‘ if this is the @entity62 ’s approach on tax collection , why should anyone bother paying any tax at all ? ‘ this is a move geared towards winning a few extra votes , and is nothing but a tax - dodger ’s charter and a final act of financial irresponsibility from @entity0			1
