despite their father 's claim that they ' tend to do everything together ' most siblings would balk at sharing their wedding day with their brothers and sisters - particularly the brides			1
however the five @entity11 siblings - @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 - synchronized their weddings and all married on the same day , one after the other , at the @entity19 temple in @entity20 , @entity21			1
the brothers and sisters - aged between 20 and 28 - then threw a joint reception so large it had to be held in a hangar at an airplane museum			2
the joint @entity19 wedding took place on august 10			1
one by one , the ceremonies were held - three in the morning with a break for lunch and then two in the afternoon			2
the five couples each include a sibling from the @entity40 family getting married en masse was the suggestion of father @entity51			1
after seeing that his children were in serious relationships , he joked that they should all tie the knot together			2
@entity51 told the @entity55 : ' we do tend to do everything together			1
we â€™re the ones who would take all eight to the grocery store			0
but i never thought they would each give up their special day ; they did it to be together			0
' the @entity64 have eight children - one child is already married , another attends @entity68 while the third is still living at home			0
the details of the big day fell to the siblings ' mother @entity71 who made four of the five wedding cakes and most of the food for the 1,200 guests who were invited			2
she also sewed special folders to hold all five invitations that were sent out			0
big love : the @entity11 siblings kiss their other halves at the airplane museum in @entity20 , @entity21 - which was large enough to fit their 1,200 wedding guests center of attention : from left , @entity16 , @entity40 , @entity13 , @entity38 and @entity12 sit on the steps of the @entity87 in @entity20 , @entity21 the reception was held in @entity20 's @entity90 museum - with signs hung from the rafters to designate each couple 's special wedding zone			1
however all the important moments were taken together - including first dance and removing the brides ' garters			0
fortunately for each bride , the marriage proposals took place separately			0
the eldest @entity40 sibling @entity12 was the first to get engaged to partner @entity103 at @entity104 in @entity105 back in march			1
the couple met at work after mr @entity103 moved to the state from @entity109			0
younger sister @entity13 got engaged less than a month later on april 16 after falling in love with @entity112 over a shared love of college football			2
@entity15 and @entity14 made it a joint affair by proposing to their girlfriends - @entity118 and @entity119 respectively - on the same day , april 21 , albeit in different locations			1
@entity122 said as the family began to plan for four weddings , it made sense to combine the events so that family from out of state and across the world could see all the brothers and sisters getting married			0
the huge celebration was completed when sister @entity16 and her boyfriend @entity134 got engaged just two months ago in june			0
the couples were already planning to mark their special day by organizing a joint trip to mark their first wedding anniversary next year			0
keeping it in the family : father @entity51 ( back right with wife @entity71 ) has said that his eight children ( pictured , including the three not getting married ) always do everything together something to remember : from left , @entity41 and @entity42 , @entity36 and @entity37 , @entity40 and @entity144 , @entity38 and @entity145 , and @entity12 and @entity103 on their joint wedding day sharing special moments : the @entity40 clan gather for the wedding tradition of removing the bride 's garter at their reception on august 10			1

@entity12 , @entity13 , @entity15 , @entity14 and @entity156 all took the *plunge* on august 10 at the @entity19 temple in @entity20 , @entity21
@entity51 , father of the siblings , said : ' we do tend to do everything together '
