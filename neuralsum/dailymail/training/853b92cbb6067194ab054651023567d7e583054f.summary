as they bound around in a blur of fur and gleaming teeth , it ’s impossible to tell one dog from the other			2
but when owner @entity8 instructs them to start dancing and prancing , it ’s rather easier to see who ’s the professional canine entertainer who won @entity12 ’s @entity11 – and who needs to work on his quick - step			1
‘ @entity15 ! ’ @entity8 shrieks as the hapless puppy springs around like a @entity17			1
‘ listen ! concentrate please			0
as you can see he ’s got a long way to go before he ’s anywhere near @entity8			1
’ teaching a new dog , old tricks : @entity8 poses with @entity8 on her back and sully beneath @entity15 , or @entity25 , or @entity26 of @entity27 to use his official name , is set to be the new @entity8			1
there is even talk of them becoming the first ever doggy double act			0
@entity8 bought sully 18 months ago from a family friend when he was just a week old and ever since she has been training him in case performing becomes too much for @entity8			1
but she believes her star pupil , and beloved pet , has ‘ got a few years left in him yet ’			0
until then , @entity25 is strictly just a part of @entity39			1
he accompanies him on most big acting jobs to be his playmate and ‘ stress reliever ’			0
it 's a disco inferno : sully and @entity8 practise the sort of carefully choreographed dances moves he was recently on hand in @entity8 ’s trailer on set of @entity50 : @entity51 , which premieres next week			1
and come december the puppy protege will play the understudy – or should that be underdog – when @entity8 stars with @entity8 in the panto @entity57 in @entity58			1
‘ sully will be there , ’ @entity8 confirms			1
‘ if anything happened to @entity8 – say he became ill one day – then i ’d have to go on with @entity25			1
@entity8 takes the lead and shows sully how he wowed @entity62 in @entity12 's @entity11 ' he ’s done a lot more performing this year and he ’s getting better			1
@entity25 thinks he ’s the next top dog			1
he tries to push @entity8 out of the way when they ’re together			1
’ the @entity67 has been granted an exclusive audience with the canine pair			0
it is @entity25 ’s first ever public performance and the first time @entity8 has attempted to make them perform together			1
he may be a bit rough around the edges , but at just 17 months old @entity25 can prance on his hind legs , pirouette , wave , hide and beg , just like @entity8			1
at one point both dogs stand masterfully with their paws on @entity8 ’s shoulders			2
@entity25 can even do things his friend can not			1
he can reverse around @entity8 and walk backwards like a pro. ‘ @entity25 does look to @entity8 to help him out with the trickier moves , ’ @entity8 reveals			1
‘ he watched @entity8 walking on his back legs and thought , “ hmm i could give that a go ” and just did it			2
‘ this is the first time i ’ve put them together			0
it ’s difficult with two , but perhaps they could be a double act			0
i could do a routine to @entity96 because they do try to outdo each other			0
’ @entity8 will be ten next year , but retirement looks a long way off			2
he looks fitter than ever , perhaps because he has his own doggy treadmill			0
‘ it keeps his muscles strong , ’ @entity8 says			2
‘ he would n’t be able to stand on his back legs for so long if he was n’t fit			0
when @entity8 wants to retire , he ’ll let us know			2
’ like @entity8 , @entity25 is a @entity107 @entity106 powderpuff and @entity109 cross , but has a smattering of poodle instead of @entity112			1
@entity8 and @entity8 : she is training @entity25 to do the same tricks as star dog @entity8 he is named after sully from the @entity116 film @entity117 because of his blue merle colouring – ‘ and he ’s a little monster ’			1
‘ he ’s probably one of the naughtiest puppies i have ever known , ’ @entity8 says			2
‘ he steals my dirty socks			0
he ’s quite a weird dog			2
he used to dig up mum ’s plants and run around shaking them like a trophy			0
’ he has also been known to terrorise mum ’s prize - winning show guinea pigs which , before @entity25 had his way , were allowed to roam in the family ’s garden in @entity133			1
‘ @entity25 caught a couple and decided to de-hair them , ’ @entity8 says			1
‘ it took six months for their fur to grow back			0
’ star in the making : if anything happens to @entity8 , @entity8 says @entity25 will take over @entity25 ’s arrival did not go down well			1
‘ @entity8 was n’t impressed , ’ @entity8 says			2
‘ for two weeks he blanked him entirely			0
when he realised he was n’t leaving he gave up and played with him instead			0
now they ’re like brothers ; they ’re inseparable			0
’ @entity8 herself has blossomed from a shy 16 - year - old on @entity12 ’s @entity11 to a 19 - year - old brimming with confidence and grand plans			1
she admits to not doing very well in her as level exams last year , but says dog dancing is her career now			0
with more than £ 1 million in the bank thanks to her @entity154 winnings , a book and calendar deal , many , many appearances and , of course the movie , one can forgive her for feeling unfazed by her lack of educational success			0
puparazzi shots : the canine stars check how they look on @entity67 photographer @entity164 's camera she was n’t in @entity39 : @entity51 , bar a few shots of her in the crowd , but seems resigned to playing second fiddle to her beloved pooch			0
‘ i ’m not envious of my dogs , ’ she says			0
‘ i won @entity12 ’s @entity11 because of my dog and @entity8 is a lot cuter than i am			1
but i ’d like to move forward without my dogs			0
i ’d like to get into presenting one day			0
’ but right now , she has her work cut out with naughty @entity25			2
‘ this morning we got home to find the police at our door , ’ @entity8 says			2
‘ the dogs had got out of their room and set the burglar alarm off			0
i must say @entity25 looked very sheepish			2
i ’m sure he was the culprit			0

@entity8 won @entity12 's @entity11 with her performing dog @entity8
now she has bought @entity25 who she hopes will follow in @entity8 's paw steps
@entity8 bought sully 18 months ago from a family friend
she has been training him in case performing becomes too much for @entity8
