by @entity0 last updated at 4:49 am on 16th december 2011 @entity1 relies on ' landmark ' information the search giant has ' bought in ' from mapping companies such as @entity6			2
but a new version of @entity1 's @entity8 lets anyone add landmarks to @entity1 - letting any user add on points of interest , draw on more detailed maps , and even review and delete other people 's edits			1
one of the uses @entity1 showed off for the new version of @entity8 was drawing a ' boundary ' round a university - information currently lacking from @entity1 @entity20 is accessible via any web browser , and usable by anyone with a @entity1 account			2
@entity1 suggests uses such as adding whether a street is one - way - crucial to the sat - nav service it offers on @entity29 phones - and adding details such as lakes to parks , which currently appear as a blank green space			2
' update the actual map as seen by millions of users on @entity1 , ' the site promises			1
you can add places - such as new shops - edit other people 's additions , and review other people 's edits			1
@entity1 also approve every edit before it goes live on @entity1 , so towns are n't going to be ' digitally vandalised ' by a deluge of unnecessary information			0
@entity1 's new version of @entity8 will allow any users to add their own landmarks - or even edit other users ' landmarks on the site			1
@entity1 will approve landmarks before they ' go live ' , though the underlying information in @entity1 will still also be provided by @entity6 , so major landmarks wo n't be affected			0
@entity1 says its business relationship with @entity6 ' will continue ' - although some tech insiders suspect that this move is a prelude to @entity1 building its own ' crowd - sourced ' database of information			0
in response to a question about whether @entity1 would continue to rely on @entity6 , a spokesperson said , ' @entity6 is a valued partner to @entity1 and they continue to provide us with data for dozens of countries			0
' @entity69 , one of @entity1 's software engineers on their maps , said in a blog post , ' today , we ’re revealing a new version of @entity20 to help users map the places they know best and make their hometowns sparkle on @entity1			1
' @entity1 's new version of @entity8 will allow users to ' enrich ' the map with their own edits - although @entity1 insists that its business relationship with @entity6 , who provide the underlying data in the maps , will not change ' with @entity8 , you can easily help ensure that the changing world around you is accurately reflected on the map			1
add your favorite gift shop , the nearest tree farm , or even the golf course where you once got that hole in one			0
' ' it ’s also easier to mark the best route to @entity93 ’s house and draw better buildings with courtyards and crisper corners			0
the options are endless when it comes to mapping the places you know and love			0
' ' once approved , your contributions will appear on @entity1 , @entity104 and @entity1 for mobile for all the world to see			0
' @entity1 pointed to an @entity108 high - school student , @entity107 , who has added dozens of @entity108 cycle trails to the sites , and said , ' why not make your @entity112 ’s resolution to improve the map for millions of people ? '			1

' update the actual map as seen by millions ' - @entity1
lets you edit and add landmarks to @entity1
edits are reviewed by @entity1 before they appear
could @entity1 switch to ' user - created ' maps ?
