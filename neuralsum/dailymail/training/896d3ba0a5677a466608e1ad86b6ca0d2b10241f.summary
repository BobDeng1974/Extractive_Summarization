astronomers have spotted glimmers of ' @entity2 ' – a giant , almost invisible galaxy lurking just outside our own			1
the mysterious galaxy is made up mostly of dark matter and has previously only been detectable by its large gravitational pull			1
now , a cluster of young , pulsating stars discovered at the far side of the @entity13 have marked the location the dwarf galaxy , which is hidden behind clouds of dust			2
astronomers have spotted glimmers of ' @entity2 ' – a giant , almost invisible galaxy lurking just outside our own			2
pictured is a supercomputer simulation showing how galaxies may have dark matter satellites ( shown in yellow and orange ) such as @entity27 learning more about @entity27 could be a major step in verifying our understanding of how the universe began from primordial matter , as well as the @entity33			1
existing theories correctly predict the distribution of distant galaxies			0
but the same theory also predicts hundreds of dwarf galaxies around the @entity13			2
up until now , only only a few dozen have been found			0
@entity2 could help uncover even more			2
a team , led by @entity41 from @entity42 in @entity43 , looked at four young stars 300,000 light years away			0
these young stars are @entity47 variables – ' standard candles ' that astronomers use to measure distances			0
according to professor @entity41 , these are the most distant @entity47 variables found close to the plane of the @entity13			2
the stars appear to be associated with a dwarf galaxy the team predicted in 2009 based on her analysis of ripples in the @entity13 's outer disk			1
radiation from the @entity47 variable stars allowed the team to find out accurate distances and test an earlier prediction of its location			0
' these young stars are likely the signature of this predicted galaxy , ' said professor @entity41			0
' they ca n't be part of our galaxy because the disk of the @entity13 terminates at 48,000 light years			2
' scientists had previously predicted that despite largely being made up of dark matter , @entity27 should have a sprinkling of dim stars			1
learning more about @entity27 could be a major step in verifying our understanding of how the universe began from primordial matter , as well as the @entity33			1
scientists had previously predicted that despite largely being made up of dark matter , @entity27 should have a sprinkling of dim stars but finding these had proved difficult as the dark matter galaxy lies in the same plane as the @entity13 disk			1
' the discovery of the @entity47 variables shows that our method of finding the location of dark - matter dominated dwarf galaxies works , ' she said			1
' it may help us ultimately understand what dark matter is made up of			1
invisible particles known as dark matter make up 23 per cent of the mass of the universe			1
the mysterious matter represents a problem in astronomy because it is not understood			0
' [ the study ] shows that @entity105 's theory of gravity can be used out to the farthest reaches of a galaxy , and that there is no need to modify our theory of gravity , ' professor @entity41 added			0
learning more about @entity27 could be a major step in verifying our understanding of how the universe began from primordial matter , as well as current understanding about the @entity33 , the researchers claim			1

@entity2 was previously spotted by ripples in the @entity13 's outer disk
now researchers have found four stars in dark matter - dominated area
learning more about @entity27 could be a major step in improving our understanding of how the universe began from primordial matter
