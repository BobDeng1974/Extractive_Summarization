a @entity1 mother who gave birth to her son at 19 weeks posted her story and photographs on her blog to share with friends and family , but her brave choice has spread way beyond her immediate circle to bring comfort to other grieving mothers			1
@entity14 was 30 years old and 19 weeks pregnant with her third child when she began bleeding lightly			1
not overly worried , she called her midwife and as a precaution was advised to head to the @entity18 in a @entity19 , @entity21 hospital for a check - up			0
by the end of the day , her son @entity23 had been born and died in her arms			1
warning : @entity26 perfectly formed : @entity14 holds the tiny hand of her son @entity23 precious moments : @entity14 holds her son , who was born after she went into labor while only 19 weeks pregnant @entity14 had no inkling that the day , which began with a pedicure and lunch with a friend and bride - to - be whose wedding she was supposed to photograph the following day , would end in such devastating loss			1
in a waiting room in the hospital , @entity14 was given three glasses of water to drink in preparation for an ultrasound			2
soon after , she began to feel the first twinges of pain			0
a few minutes after 6pm , ' i knew i was in labor , there was no doubt in my mind , ' wrote @entity14 on her blog			1
nurses were sceptical and she was finally taken for her ultrasound at 7pm			0
@entity14 felt heartened when the technician found a heartbeat , but soon her bleeding increased and the pain of her contractions intensified			2
taken too soon : @entity23 's tiny heart was still beating as his mother and father said their goodbyes closure : @entity65 and his wife @entity66 say being able to hold their son and say goodbye has helped their healing process the ultrasound technician told her husband when @entity14 was out of the room , ' i ’m sorry , and i do n’t want her to see me crying , but i will be praying for you			1
' ' at this point there was no break between the contractions			0
just as one finished another would start			0
i knew that i was at the end			0
i did n't give up hope , but in my heart of hearts , i knew that i was losing my baby			2
' at some point the @entity1 came in and said " your foetus is still viable			0
" i seriously wanted to slap her			0
when the doctor checked me and sat down beside me on the bed and told me that we were going to be delivering our baby , it was the first that anyone had called him a baby			0
' i immediately started bawling and asking if there was any other option , ' she wrote			0
@entity101 was born at 9:42pm			1
family : the @entity103 also wanted their two daughters to be able to farewell their longed - for brother discussion : @entity14 says pre-term labor and miscarriage are n't spoken about and many women are not given an opportunity to grieve after losing a baby early in pregnancy ' i was crying so hard at this point but he was perfect			1
he was fully formed and everything was there , i could see his heart beating in his tiny chest , ' wrote @entity121 some point , @entity14 's husband @entity116 went to her car and retrieved the camera she was going to shoot her friend 's wedding on and took photographs of the couple 's first son			1
' i am so very glad that @entity116 [ did that ]			0
at first i did not want any photos , but they are the only thing i have to look back on now , ' @entity14 wrote			2
' i held him , cuddled him , while his heart was beating i held him to my heart , i counted his toes and kissed his tiny head			0
i will always cherish those memories that i have of him			0
' beloved son : @entity14 says the term ' fetus ' is insulting , and that her son was a baby , even though he was so tiny @entity14 shared the confronting yet touching images not to cause controversy , but to open up discussion about a tragedy that affects more than 1 million @entity147 women each year : pre-term labor			1
' pre-term labour and infant loss is not something the public wants to talk about , ' says @entity14			1
' to most people it 's not a big deal , you just try again for another baby , so they pretend it never happened and go on with their lives while the mother and family are left in a pile of grief they do n't know how to deal with			2
memories : photographs and memories are all the @entity103 have left of @entity23 ' it is also very common for medical staff to take these babies away and dispose of them as medical waste , so many mothers never get to see or hold their babies , or even know if it was a boy or a girl			1
' @entity14 says she 's had many emails from women who have experienced miscarriage and for whom her words and pictures helped to bring healing			1
' i ’m still in shock at how much his photos have been shared and commented on			0
in his short life of just a few minutes he has touched more lives then i ever could have imagined , ' said @entity14 .			2

@entity14 went into labor when she was just 19 weeks pregnant
her son @entity101 was born and died in her arms
her husband took photographs of the tiny baby and @entity14 shared her story and pictures on her blog
she wanted to share the story with family and friends in her small town and not have the agony of *retelling* the *traumatic* experience
the story spread much further *afield* and has been shared by thousands around the world
@entity14 says she hopes the story of her son @entity23 can help open up discussion about pre-term labor and miscarriage , which affect more than 1 million women in @entity147 each year
