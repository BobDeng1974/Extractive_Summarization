usually when president @entity1 steps out on @entity2 , it 's his brilliant green tie which steals the show			1
but today another accessory won the day - the enormous new ' smart watch ' festooning the commander - in - chief 's wrist			1
@entity1 was seen today wearing the hefty item - a @entity10 device - as he walked around @entity11 and met with @entity13 prime minister @entity12 , and later lunched with congressmen on @entity15			1
it uses @entity43 sensors to measure heart rate , and can function as a calorie counter and gps device			2
it also tells the time			0
the surge model is the largest and most sophisticated @entity22 model , and sells for around $ 250			1
@entity1 has previous expressed his interest in emergent ' wearable ' technology			0
in a february interview with re / code , he seemed torn between getting a @entity22 and an @entity26 watch			1
testing it out : @entity1 suiting up : @entity1 was pictured earlier today with the watch while getting dressed he said : ' i do n’t have a @entity22 yet , but i work out hard			0
word is these @entity59 might be a good companion for my workouts			0
so i ’m gon na see , i ’m gon na test it out			0
' the testing had evidently begun by tuesday , when @entity1 prominently wore the device for his public engagements			1
fitbit enthusiasts are encouraged to even wear their device to sleep , where it collects data while the subject is unconscious , and can wake them up with silent , vibrating alarms			0
one feature the president may be particularly keen on is that the device is programmable to have a golf mode			2
fitbits are set up to communicate with mobile devices regularly to store the data they collect - however the president is only allowed a @entity80 because of security concerns , which is incompatible with his new toy			2
both the @entity83 and @entity22 have yet to respond to requests for comment .			0
