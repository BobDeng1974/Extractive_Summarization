@entity1 's first - half strike helped ease the pressure on @entity4 manager @entity3 with a 1 - 0 win away at @entity6 in @entity7 - hours after the @entity9 boss was backed to continue in his job by a member of the club 's board			1
the former @entity15 and @entity16 manager picked up just his second league win of the season against the minnows who just escaped relegation last year , and seems to have the support of at least some of the club 's hierarchy			2
fans have stayed away from the @entity28 's @entity27 home this season , frustrated at the team 's lacklustre performances and failure to qualify for the @entity33			1
the pressure hanging over @entity3 at @entity4 has been eased by a 1 - 0 win away at @entity6 @entity1 scored the only goal of the game to defeat @entity6 and give @entity3 hope for his job @entity1 celebrates his strike after latching on to @entity40 's expertly - executed cross but @entity3 received a double - boost this weekend with the news of @entity44 's backing - and taking three points from the trip to the @entity47			1
' @entity3 is a coach of immense experience and excellent results			0
he has won several trophies at clubs without huge tradition , ' @entity4 director @entity44 said			2
' obviously at this moment he is very concentrated and is perhaps not too focused on speaking to the media			0
in these situations , the best thing is to lock down with the team and work			0
' his career and his working methods can not be put in doubt			0
' @entity60 offers his congratulations to @entity1 in a game @entity4 were perhaps lucky to win the @entity4 players show their togetherness on the field as they celebrate the only goal of the game @entity9 striker @entity1 scored the only goal of the game in @entity6 , knocking in a brilliant cross from @entity40 at the back post just before the half - hour mark			1
@entity72 has a shot deflected onto the crossbar for the hosts late on but @entity4 clung on to claim just their second league win of the season			2
@entity40 was at the heart of everything good for the @entity82 outfit and assisted the winner for @entity1 ' our team over the last two seasons has been attack - minded and in fact we are the only side that plays regularly with four forwards , ' @entity44 added , speaking to @entity90			1
' last season we scored 104 goals			0
balance is important and we are a little forward - heavy , but that just means we have to do even better			0
' @entity96 grabs hold of @entity98 as things get a little heated during a tight match at the @entity101 @entity3 will hope that @entity40 's undoubted ability upfront can help guide @entity4 up the table now			1

@entity44 has thrown his backing behind @entity3 's reign
his @entity4 side claimed just their second win of the season at @entity6
the @entity82 outfit failed to qualify for the @entity33 this season
fans have stayed away from games , frustrated with the team 's *progress*
but @entity44 has said @entity3 is the best option for the club
@entity1 struck in the first half for a nervy 1 - 0 win against @entity6
