the aspiring model , from @entity17 , @entity18 , ran the first half of the marathon in two hours and seven minutes – an average time for an amateur athlete			1
however , he ran the second half of the race in just one hour and one minute – quicker than @entity10 hero @entity9 who completed the same stretch in one hour and five minutes			1
it means @entity27 - @entity1 finished the race in an impressive three hours and eight minutes – putting him in the top six per cent of competitors			1
however , online forums are awash with claims the runner cheated his way to the super-fast time , with some speculating he jumped over a waist - high barrier at the halfway point at @entity37			1

it is claimed he then jumped back into the race , joining a leading group of runners , and sprinted his way to the finish			2
the official @entity6 website logs his progress around the first half of the course , giving updates for every 5kms he completed			1
however , it only gives estimated times at the 25km , 30km and 35km markers – which has prompted critics to believe he either cheated his way to the finish by dodging those checkpoints or that his chip failed to activate at those points			0

one user , @entity92 , posted on a forum on @entity94 : ‘ first half seems fair enough			2
second half is nothing short of a miracle			0
‘ it is possible that he ran easy for the first half , then went all out in the second half			2
‘ however , it would need a chip malfunction at 25 , 30 , and 35k for this to have happened			0
‘ it would also mean that he is capable of running a half at just over 60 minute pace , which again is possible if he was a @entity110 elite runner , but certainly not after doing a 13.1 mile warm up			0

’ another marathon runner , @entity133 , said : ‘ i saw @entity2 just after @entity37 and he was absolutely smashing it ’ , before adding : ‘ @entity135 noted the barrier skip … that would make complete sense as to why i saw him there , looking so fresh ! ’ and @entity148 said : ‘ if he did cheat then i think a ban is in order , i worked very hard for my time this year , did a sub 3:30 for my first marathon and went through a lot of pain in the last three miles , if people are skipping out miles then shame on them ! ’ @entity151 confirmed @entity27 - @entity1 ’ results were being investigated			1
