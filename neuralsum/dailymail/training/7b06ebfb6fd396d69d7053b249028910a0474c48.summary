during a @entity2 meeting called to brief @entity4 's largest tech companies today about government overreach in electronic surveillance , president @entity0 changed the subject – angering some meeting participants by shifting gears to address the failed launch of healthcare.gov			1
' that was n't what we came for , ' a vice-president of a company whose ceo attended told @entity17			0
' we really did n't care for a pr pitch about how the administration is trying to salvage its internal health care tech nightmare			1
' one executive said that meeting participants were dead - set against straying from the principal focus of the meeting – the uncomfortable and legally untenable position they are in when the @entity26 demands access to their digital records			1
the @entity2 said in advance that the meeting would include a discussion of healthcare.gov , but the company executive said the only subject that mattered to the participants was the @entity26			1
' he basically hijacked the meeting , ' the executive said			0
' we all told the @entity2 that we were only there to talk about what the @entity26 was up to and how it affects us			1
' all smiles : @entity0 joked with tech executives before focusing on @entity43 and relegating the companies ' @entity26 concerns to second - tier status yet @entity0 , according to insiders , repeatedly peppered the discussion with reassuring words about how the @entity43 's marquee website was well on its way to becoming functional			1
the change was so noticeable that an @entity55 / @entity54 photographer assigned to cover the event noted in a photo caption only that @entity0 was there to ' meet with executives from leading tech companies to discuss progress with healthcare.gov			2
' one executive of a company represented at the meeting told @entity66 that a change of focus ' is not going to happen			0
we are there to talk about the @entity26			2
' another said issues other than intelligence agencies ' snooping are ' peripheral			0
' the unnamed business leader told the paper that ' there 's only one subject that people really want to discuss right now			0
' the 15 companies , including @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 , issued a one - line joint statement after the 150 - minute marathon meeting in the @entity2 's @entity89 , saying that they ' appreciated the opportunity to share directly with the president our principles on government surveillance that we released last week and we urge him to move aggressively on reform			1
' there was no mention in the statement of healthcare.gov			0
hands on the table , @entity103 : vice president @entity104 was seated next to one of the meeting 's few female participants , @entity81 ceo @entity105			0
@entity104 made headlines yesterday for his roving paws at a holiday party a serious matter : reporters on tuesday put @entity2 press secretary @entity113 on the spot about about a federal judge who declared that the @entity26 's bulk collection of millions of @entity4 ' telephone records is unconstitutional but in its statement to reporters about the meeting , the @entity2 played up the significance of focusing portions of the get - together on how to fix the government 's disastrous health insurance website			1
@entity0 and the executives ' discussed a number of issues ... including the progress being made to improve performance and capacity issues with heathcare.gov , ' the statement began			0
after announcing a changing of the guard in the push to repair the site , the @entity2 noted that ' [ f ] inally , the group discussed the national security and economic impacts of unauthorized intelligence disclosures			0
' a group of eight tech companies , including some in attendance on tuesday , asked @entity0 last week for an overhaul of the surveillance laws that govern the @entity26			2
' the balance in many countries has tipped too far in favor of the state and away from the rights of the individual – rights that are enshrined in our @entity155 , " they wrote in an open letter to the president			2
distraction : @entity0 took time out from the supposedly @entity26 - focused meeting to announce that @entity159 ( @entity160 ) would be replaced as his healthcare website czar a federal judge ruled monday that their concerns about government spy programs are well - founded			1
@entity4 district court judge @entity167 declared that the @entity26 's broad seizures of telecommunications companies ' call records violate the @entity171 to the @entity155			1
that provision protects @entity4 from unreasonable searches			1
the ruling is already being seen as partial validation for the exiled leaker @entity177 , who exposed details of the @entity26 's huge data collection program to the public this year			2
' i have significant doubts about the efficacy of the metadata collection program as a means of conducting time - sensitive investigations in cases involving imminent threats of terrorism , ' the judge wrote in his ruling			0
' i can not imagine a more ‘ indiscriminate ’ and ‘ arbitrary invasion ’ than this systematic and high - tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every single citizen for purposes of querying it and analyzing it without judicial approval			0
' in tuesday 's meeting , @entity81 ceo @entity201 was seated next to vice president @entity104 , whose wandering hands were the subject of nationwide jokes on monday			2
the vice president was photographed at a recent holiday party posing with a reporter , who was pictured apparently making sure his grasp did n't stray north of her waist .			0

' we did n't really care for a pr pitch ' about @entity43 , said one executive
