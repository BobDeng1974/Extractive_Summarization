by @entity0 published : 19:23 est , 13 november 2013 @entity2 : 03:14 est , 14 november 2013 millions more @entity3 could be given statins to cut their risk of heart attacks and strokes after @entity9 guidelines recommended a third of adults should take them			1
the new advice tells doctors to consider a patient ’s lifetime risk and may result in a doubling of prescriptions			1
it will be closely monitored by @entity3 experts who are preparing two updated sets of guidelines on statin use			1
but the number of people taking the drugs in the @entity3 is unlikely to increase by as much as in the @entity25			1
on the rise : millions more @entity3 could be given statins to cut their risk of heart attacks and strokes after @entity9 guidelines recommended a third of adults should take them dr @entity31 , consultant cardiologist at @entity32 and the @entity33 , said : ‘ the new guidelines widen access to statin treatment			1
‘ this recognises the effectiveness of statins in reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes , their safety and the availability of lower - cost generic statins , which makes prevention more affordable			2
‘ it is a sensible step forward and it would be sensible for @entity3 to follow by introducing policies that simplify as well as broaden access to statin treatment			1
’ eight million @entity3 take statins , up from five million a decade ago			1
but experts believe many more should be on them			2
heart disease – which includes heart attacks and strokes – claims 82,000 lives annually			0
last year , @entity59 researchers claimed 2,000 lives could be saved annually if they were prescribed more widely			0
precautionary : last year , @entity59 researchers claimed 2,000 lives could be saved annually if statins were prescribed more widely at present , gps and cardiologists decide whether to prescribe statins mainly by looking at a patient ’s cholesterol level – the fatty deposits in blood that clog arteries			2
but the guidance issued in @entity9 yesterday urges doctors to consider patients ’ overall risk of heart attacks and strokes based on their age , whether they smoke , their weight and their gender			1
that may lead to more women being offered the drugs because they are more likely to have strokes than men			2
statins are recommended for 15 per cent of adults in the @entity9 , but if doctors follow the guidelines they would be prescribed to 30 per cent – 22 per cent of women and 44 per cent of men			1
dr @entity91 , associate medical director at the @entity92 , said experts drawing up the guidelines for the @entity95 would be looking closely at the @entity9 recommendations , drawn up by the @entity97 and @entity98			1
but he said it was too early to say how many more patients here would take statins as a result			0
he said : ‘ i do n’t know what effect we will see but my suspicion is it will increase			2
‘ but i ’d be very surprised if it led to a doubling in the numbers of patients			0
’ experts from the @entity112 are due to publish recommendations for gps and cardiologists on how they should prescribe statins			0
in july next year , the @entity95 rationing watchdog , @entity118 , will produce further guidance setting out when doctors should use them			0
both are expected to tell doctors to consider patients whole - life risk of heart attacks and strokes – as in the @entity9 guidelines – rather than simply focusing on cholesterol levels			1
last year there were 61million prescriptions in @entity133 for statins , which cost as little as £ 16 for a 12 - month course			0
they work by reducing the cholesterol in the arteries , and are normally given to patients with high cholesterol following a heart attack , stroke or bypass			0
around one million prescriptions for statins are written each week , compared with just a few thousand in 1981			0
statins make up nearly a fifth of all drugs prescribed for heart and circulatory disease in @entity133			0
the drugs reduce blood levels of cholesterol , which can build up inside arteries , damaging them and raising the risk of heart disease and stroke			2
they may also protect against other health problems , including blood clots and eye disorders , by maintaining a healthy blood supply to the brain			0
the most serious adverse reaction is myopathy in about one in 1,000 patients , which can result in muscle pain and weakness .			0

@entity3 experts are preparing two updated sets of guidelines on statin use
but number of people taking the drugs is likely to increase as much as in @entity9
