by @entity0 president @entity3 is practically weepy at the thought of his daughter @entity5 going off to college , a milestone many months away that is already on his mind			1
@entity5 barely reached up to her father 's shoulders when they moved to the @entity11 nearly six years ago with her mother , little sister and grandmother			1
at 16 , she stands nearly as tall as her 6 - foot - 1 dad and is visiting college campuses in preparation for that bittersweet day in the fall of 2016 when she trades her @entity11 bedroom for a dorm			1
she has been seen touring the @entity21 and the @entity22 , @entity23 , campus of @entity24 , where another president 's daughter , @entity25 , attended college			1
all grown up : at 16 , @entity5 stands nearly as tall as her 6 - foot - 1 dad and is visiting college campuses in preparation for that bittersweet day in the fall of 2016 when she trades her @entity11 bedroom for a dorm in a commencement address to high school graduates in @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity3 said he 's practicing for what 's coming in two years			1
' so i 'm trying to get used to not choking up and crying and embarrassing her			0
so this is sort of my trial run here			1
' @entity3 said during a question - and - answer session with the chief executive of @entity43 , a social media site , that his daughter , like young people in general , should shop around for a college			1
warm reminder : in a commencement address to high school graduates in @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity3 said he 's practicing for what 's coming in two years as he hugged and congratulated school leavers ' we tell her , " do n't assume that there are 10 schools that you have to go to , and if you did n't go to those 10 , that somehow things are going to be terrible , '' he said			1
' there are a lot of schools out there			0
' @entity5 goes into the 11th grade this fall at the private @entity64 in @entity65			1
the @entity68 parent 's guide to college counseling suggests that juniors take the @entity72 test in october , visit colleges as time allows , take the @entity76 exam in march and set up a family meeting with a college counselor in late spring , among other steps			2
@entity81 is also thinking about her daughter 's departure			0
in a commencement - eve address to @entity86 , @entity87 , high school seniors , the first lady said : ' days like this make me think of my own daughters , so forgive me if i get a little teary			1
' @entity25 and her mother , @entity92 , toured some colleges together , at times attracting a horde and at other times going unnoticed			2
then - president @entity97 never joined them , mainly because of the disruption that would have been caused by the large entourage that follows a president in public			2
the prevalence of social media and cellphone cameras practically guarantees that @entity5 's college search will be even more documented than @entity25 's 17 years ago			1
in september 1997 , more than 200 journalists showed up to cover her first day at @entity24			2
@entity97 and his wife , who was @entity3 's first secretary of state , were shocked when their only child chose to attend college some 3,000 miles away			0
her parents were educated at @entity113 universities - @entity114 for him and @entity115 for her - before they met at @entity116			0
and they thought @entity117 would follow their path			0
in her syndicated newspaper column , @entity92 wrote about her dread at having to say goodbye to @entity117			0
trial run : in his speech , he said he was ' trying to get used to not choking up and crying and embarrassing her ' , adding , ' so this is sort of my trial run here ' memories : of course , @entity5 ( in red ) barely reached up to her father 's shoulders when they moved to the @entity11 nearly six years ago with her mother , little sister and grandmother @entity5 's journey into the next phase of her life will be a similarly emotional time for @entity3 , who grew up without his dad			1
he talks about his desire to be a ' present ' father for @entity5 and @entity143 , 13 , and how living in the @entity11 enabled the family to spend more time together than ever before			2
close : @entity3 talks about his desire to be a ' present ' father for @entity5 and @entity143 , 13 , and how living in the @entity11 enabled the family to spend more time together than ever before the @entity5 lived in @entity147 when the girls were born , but he was often away in @entity149 , @entity150 , when he was a state senator , or in @entity65 representing @entity150 as a @entity152 senator			2
children already seem to grow up too fast , but it ' happens more suddenly for a president and a president can feel cheated , ' said @entity157 , who interviewed 19 children of presidents for his book , ' all the @entity162 ' children			0
' ' the president is feeling some angst over this , and rightly so			0
' already this summer , @entity5 has worked in @entity166 as a production assistant on the set of ' @entity169 , ' a new @entity171 sci - fi thriller starring @entity172 and produced by @entity174 donor @entity173			1
she 's also learning how to drive			0
perhaps compounding emotions for the @entity5 is that they , too , will follow @entity5 out of the @entity11 shortly after she starts college			1
it comes amid reports @entity3 has reportedly already ‘ checked out ’ of his job even though there are more than two years left until he leaves office in january 2017 , a few months after @entity5 departs			2
the @entity152 president is said to have played 81 rounds of golf since re-election – as many as he played in his entire first term – and has holed himself up in @entity65 where he attends fundraisers and dinners with celebrities rather than tackling the day - to - day business of congressional politics			0
he is already all but a lame duck due to deadlock on @entity193 and has been forced to use executive powers to enact reforms			0
but come the mid-term elections in november , he could lose power entirely if the @entity198 take the @entity199			0
in the meantime , commentators claim he believes that his time in office is effectively over – and has begun enjoying himself			0
@entity152 reports say he has been house hunting and has looked at a £ 2.5million mansion in @entity207 , @entity23 – dubbed the ‘ playground of the presidents ’ .			0

he made remarks at high - school graduation *ceremony* in @entity33 , @entity213
he said the event was a ' trial run ' for him as he hugged graduates
@entity5 , 16 , has started looking at colleges *including* @entity21 and @entity24
he also told graduates he tells @entity5 to ' shop around ' for the right college
