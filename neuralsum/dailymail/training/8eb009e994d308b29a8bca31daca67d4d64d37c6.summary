by @entity1 reporter usually it 's the dogs that do the fetching , but that was n't the case this weekend when emergency crews were brought in to retrieve a dog that became stranded on a cliff face in @entity10			1
the black - and - whie @entity11 named @entity12 needed rescuing after she wandered 40 feet down a 90 - foot cliff face saturday afternoon at @entity15 in @entity16			1
' it was kind of like a billy goat trail the dog went down , ' cpt @entity17 of the @entity19 told the @entity23			2
' even the dog realized it was a dumb move			2
rescuers initially tried calling at the dog to come back up the hill , but scared @entity12 would n't budge			2
they also considered a rope rescue over the cliff 's edge , but had a hard time maneuvering the necessary vehicles close enough to the ledge			1
eventually , they settled on using a helicopter with a sheriff 's deputy attached on a 100 - foot line to hover over the scene and collect @entity12			1
helicopter pilot @entity49 took a few low passes over the area so @entity12 would n't be too spooked when they come in for the rescue			0
bring in the helicopter : firefighters got a call about the stranded dog saturday afternoon and eventually settled on an air rescue let 's get out of here : @entity12 was more than happy to be rescued by the sheriff 's deputy dangling from an 100 - foot line up and out : the sheriff 's deputy bear - hugged @entity12 and then kicked off from the edge and they took off toward level ground back on level land : @entity12 's owner , a woman from @entity68 who drove up for the day , was relieved to be reunited with her dog then deputy @entity70 strapped on to the end of a rope and was picked up off the ground and flown over to @entity12			1
not sure how the dog would react to a stranger wearing a flight suit and helmet , deputy @entity70 brought a towel with him to throw over the dog 's head in case she decided to bite			0
luckily , there was no need since it was obvious that @entity12 was more than happy to be rescued			0
' the dog and i got to know each other real quick , ' @entity70 said			0
