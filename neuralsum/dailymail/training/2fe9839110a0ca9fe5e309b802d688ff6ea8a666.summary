@entity7 ( pictured ) will live in an art gallery comprising a bed and bathroom area and will not remove the @entity12 headset for the duration of the exhibition the social - artistic experiment will be overseen by a psychologist because no - one has ever worn a virtual reality headset for so long in one stint and there are health concerns			1
‘ for 24 hours a day for 28 days , artist @entity39 will wear a virtual reality headset through which he will experience life through another person ’s eyes and ears - this person will be referred to as ‘ the other ’ , according to the @entity46 website			1
the artist is raising cash on the crowd funding website to make the exhibition possible			0
‘ for 24 hours a day for 28 days , artist @entity39 will wear a @entity51 through which he will experience life through another person ’s eyes and ears - this person will be referred to as ‘ the other ’ , according to the @entity46 website			1
he is shown sleeping in an @entity12 , in a test run he will have no previous relationship with the person through whom he will experience the world , but will be aware that ‘ the other ’ is a heterosexual male , who is in a relationship			2
‘ the other ’ person living outside the gallery , will have to wear a pair of glasses that covertly capture audio and video			0
this footage will then be watched back by mr @entity7 , who will inhabit a space consisting of only a bed , a toilet and shower area , and will be on constant display to the public apart from one hour after he goes to sleep			2
@entity7 ( pictured ) will have no contact with any other real humans during the time of isolation and will eat what ‘ the other ’ eats and shower when ‘ the other ’ showers , for example during this time , a psychologist will check on mr @entity7 ’s welfare and the headset will also act as a ‘ verbal diary ’ to capture his mental health , the website says			1
the artist will have no contact with any other real humans during the time of isolation and will eat what ‘ the other ’ eats and shower when ‘ the other ’ showers , for example			0
presumably the artist will see the most intimate details of the ' other 's ' life through his eyes			0
the team of artists and video directors behind the project write : ‘ over the course of the project , it will become apparent whether @entity7 will begin to lose his own sense of self , and start to inhabit the reality of the other			0
’ ‘ with no one to talk to , and no one to validate any of @entity7 ’s thoughts , will his only source of validation - the other ’s life - become the life which makes sense to @entity7 ? ’ the artist could alternatively retain his own sense of self and exist in a strange ‘ @entity120 ’ they explained			0
the findings of the arty experiment will be made into a documentary which will include commentary by psychiatrists , psychologists , neuroscientists , philosophers and artists			0
so far the group of artists behind the project have raised just over £ 2,000 of their ambitious £ 150,000 goal , with 29 days to go			0
the exhibition seeks to find out whether the artist will lose his sense of self and experience life though another person ’s eyes			0
the end result of the experiment is unknown to everyone , and has the potential for a variety of implications to the artist ’s physical and mental health			2
a psychologist will check on @entity7 ’s health throughout the 28 days and if he is not coping it will be cut short			2
his physical and mental health will be constantly monitored to ensure his eyesight is not harmed by wearing a virtual reality headset for so long , for example			1
he is undergoing sessions with a psychologist in preparation for this project so it is possible to assess how the project has affected him .			0
