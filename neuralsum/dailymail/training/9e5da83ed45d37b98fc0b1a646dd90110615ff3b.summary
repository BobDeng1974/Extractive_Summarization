when un-retouched photographs of , what appeared to be , a @entity1 campaign starring @entity2 leaked last night the internet was sent into a tail spin and the unflattering pictures went viral			1
the unflattering images of the usually flawless star , which show bumpy - looking skin and harsh make - up , were tweeted , blogged , @entity12 and re-grammed thousands upon thousands of times			1
but while some have been cruel about the appearance of the singer 's complexion , the majority of have been quick to support the singer , jumping to her defence			1
' another named @entity39 * * _ bonet said : ' i do n't care for @entity2 but i 'm glad those pictures leaked			1
she 's an actual person & it 's deceiving of the media to retouch for perfection			2
' one named @ @entity45 said : ' so @entity2 is actually a human being , @entity47 ! she 's still beautiful			1
leaking those photos was in very poor taste			0
' meanwhile , @entity53 readers told us they feel empowered by seeing images of @entity2 with her flaws on show			1
@entity57 , 29 , told us : ' it makes me feel amazing to know that she does n't have a defined jaw line and , if anything , a little angry that this whole time i 've been looking in the mirror hating mine , when it 's obviously a problem even she has			2
' also , her make - up looks like end - of - the - night make - up , which i think is reassuring as it shows the power of retouching			1
maybe we all look like @entity2 at the end of an evening			1
the images , which have been shared thousands of times show @entity2 with pimply skin and neck lines some users took to @entity29 to post mean comments about the leaked pictures of @entity2 but @entity57 also said that she does n't feel tricked by photoshopping as she knows it 's part of advertising : ' i do n't even really mind about her skin , i could guess that that was probably glossed over to make the pictures look a little more smooth			1
' and @entity85 , 37 , from @entity86 , agreed : ' i think it 's a good thing that the pictures leaked			1
girls need to realise that women are real and not dolls			2
and she still looks great anyway			0
' the images , however , did stir up a sense of resentment at the celebrity culture of doctoring pictures			2
she said : ' perfection on those airbrushed terms is simply un-achievable , and it 's wrong that we 're led to believe that flawlessness equals greatness			2
' women took to @entity29 to react to the @entity2 photo leak with one saying that those who were shocked needed to take a long hard look at themselves @entity109 , 35 , said : ' although it can be refreshing to see that even women with all the money in the world to spend on their appearance , still suffer from ' real ' problems like bad skin , it 's not a reason to gloat about it			1
' no one enjoys having their spotty pictures put out in the world and if this was on @entity125 any of us would immediately click ' de-tag '			1
' here , the lighting seems so harsh that anyone 's skin would look bad under it , and the make - up itself just does n't suit her - the red lipstick looks sticky , the eye - liner makes her usually beautiful eyes look small and a bit squinty			1
' @entity137 is one of the most stunning women in the world and a bad photo is n't going to take that away from her			1
' @entity142 , a photographer from @entity86 , said : ' the fact that we all care so much is the sad thing			0
i do n't re-touch my images but i light them in a flattering way , to me it just shows how much these photographers rely on post-production to make an image nowadays			2
' in this shot the singer shows off her natural beauty but many have pointed out that the photographic light will not have been flattering for her skin fans have said that they do n't feel let down by @entity2 because they expect her to be airbrushed and they think she looks great in the pictures anyway we also spoke to @entity162 the editor of the @entity164 a positive , honest online community for women			1
she said : ' unfortunately in the modern society that we live in , retouching is considered the norm			0
so much so that when a photo is leaked of a un-retouched image it 's front page news			1
' at the end of the day each and every woman , has something about their body that they are n't happy with or that they wish they could change			0
' instead of focusing on a muffin top or a double chin , or in @entity2 's case her face , we should be focusing on their achievements			1
' in a @entity1 advert from 2013 @entity2 is seen with flawless skin which looks like it has been photoshopped @entity162 continued : ' the women who are retouched in the media are n't just models , they are career women who have achieved brilliant success			1
' be it actresses , designers or women in business			2
when we look at these images they should feel inspired by their accomplishments , not distracted at how shiny their hair looks or how smooth their skin is			0
' in reality , all women are a little bit lumpy and bumpy			1
so instead of airbrushing that out we should instead be embracing the real woman that has worked her socks off to even be in that magazine in the first place ' photographer @entity214 , who doctors photographs himself said : ' everyone needs to be reminded that more often than not the imagery that we see on a daily basis is hyper - real and has seen many hours of @entity220			1
' we have become numb to this and our demand for flawless perfection puts pressure on those in the media , we should n't be shocked by these unedited images - it 's nice to be reminded that everyone is human			1
' in 2010 @entity231 sanctioned the release of these images of herself by the company candies , the images show how different advertising shots can be from the originals in the before and after images @entity231 shows how her image has been altered with her bum made smaller and her cellulite removed of course this is n't the first time that a celebrity has fallen foul of a leak like this			0
and in some cases they have even encouraged companies to show off their unedited pictures			2
in 2010 @entity251 release edited and unedited images of herself , clearly showing how her image had been altered			0
despite being naturally slim in one set of after pictures where @entity231 is facing the camera the singer was given a smaller waist as well as slimmer thighs , she also had her bruises removed			2
in an after shot where she has her back to the camera she has had her tattoo removed , her bum made smaller and her cellulite removed			0
in the final poster for @entity270 @entity269 had had her breasts considerably enlarged when @entity269 starred in the film @entity270 the poster for the movie had given her with considerably larger breasts than she has in real life			0
@entity269 was n't that concerned that her body had been altered but she did n't like the shape of her breasts			0
she said : ' i was only angry when they were really droopy ... for @entity270 , for a poster , they gave me these really strange droopy tits			0
i thought , well if you 're going to make me fantasy breasts , at least make perky breasts			0
' most recently an unretouched picture of original supermodel @entity288 was published on @entity29 , showing her in a set of lingerie			0
it was first thought it was for the april 2015 issue of @entity294 but then have since revealed it was taken from a shoot done in 2013			0
the magazine then released a statement in which they praised the model saying : ' it is real , it is honest , and it is gorgeous			0
' they went on to say , ' it 's an enlightenment â€” we 've always known @entity306 was beautiful , but seeing her like this only makes us love her more			0
' similarly @entity29 users praised @entity288 with one woman named @ @entity312 saying , ' she looks amazing , why ca n't magazines just show women as they are ? ' @entity315			2
'' whilst another named @ @entity316 said , ' bravo to @entity288 for releasing her untouched photos			0
brave and beautiful # women # advertising ' @entity321 , @entity322 , @entity323 and @entity324 have all also had pictures leaked			1
when @entity323 covered @entity327 in 2010 they appeared to give her larger breasts			0
and when @entity321 shot a campaign for @entity331 in 2010 they significantly smoothed out her skin			0
airbrushing is commonplace within the media and fashion industries where women and men are often portrayed to have flawless skin and bodies			0
yet for someone , the release of their undoctored pictures just make them look even better			2
when @entity349 posed for the new @entity351 underwear collection , the picture of her posing in a @entity348 revealed just how flawless the model really is .			0
