by @entity0 murder charge : @entity2 , 36 , battered @entity3 to death in his @entity6 home when his fraud was about to be uncovered , a court heard a millionaire socialite was murdered by his financial advisor who had defrauded him of £ 343,000 to fund his fabulous lifestyle , a court heard today			1
@entity2 , 36 , drove sports cars , dined at fine restaurants and stayed at top hotels using @entity3 's money , it is claimed			1
in one night the cocaine user blew a staggering £ 19,500 in strip club @entity21 as he ‘ celebrated ’ his imminent marriage , the jury was told			1
@entity2 also used the stolen money to buy two @entity26 sports cars and to pay for holidays in @entity28 , @entity29 and the @entity30 , @entity23 heard			1
but as his dishonesty was about to be uncovered , he battered his 63 - year - old victim to death with a suitcase inside his home in a @entity6 mansion block in central @entity38 , it is claimed			2
the body was found by a cleaner in the kitchen of the flat in a pool of blood			0
prosecutor @entity45 told the jury : ' this defendant took advantage of a frail and vulnerable man for his own gains over a long period			0
' as a result he was able to live the high life but all at the expense of the deceased who , when the defendant first met him , was a rich man			0
' he died less rich by hundreds of thousands of pounds thanks to this defendant 's dishonesty			0
' when the life to which the defendant happily had become accustomed appeared to him to about to be suddenly coming to an end and that there was a real possibility that his callous acts would soon be found out , he killed him			0
' whether the murder of mr @entity3 was planned by this defendant or was committed following an argument when the deceased finally confronted him with his crime , we may never know			2
' only one person is now able to tell us and he has not done so			0
' @entity2 was a ' devious and clever man ' who had been able to carry out his deception by making mr @entity3 rely on him , it is alleged			2
mr @entity76 added : ' the defendant knew well the advantage he had and he used that advantage			0
' but the defendant had come to rely on the deceased - or rather his wealth - for his own lifestyle			0
' there were expensive sports cars , expensive restaurants , hotels , holidays and clubs , and drugs too , all that had to be paid for			1
' this is what was about to come to an end and he was likely to be exposed for what he really was - the consequences were dire			0
' mr @entity45 added that the biggest purchases included two @entity26 sports cars			2
' the reality is that the defendant spent mr @entity3 ’s investments on a much more luxurious life than his legitimate earnings would ever have allowed , ' he said			2
scene : @entity3 was found dead in his property in this mansion block in @entity6 by a cleaner earlier this year ' he bought two expensive @entity26 sports cars			1
one cost nearly £ 20,000 - it was bought in april 2010 - when the ink was hardly dry on mr @entity3 ’s first cheque that found its way into this defendant ’s account ... the second one was bought a year later in march 2011 - by which time he had taken £ 140,000 from mr @entity3 - cost £ 52,000			1
' that second @entity26 was made up of £ 37,000 that he paid with his credit card and £ 15,000 from part exchanging the first @entity26			0
' there were sports occasions - hospitality tickets obviously , it was £ 1,400 for two - at the rugby and polo - £ 1,100 for two tickets			0
' he would visit expensive hotels , expensive restaurants			0
he would take expensive holidays to @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 each costing thousands of pounds			1
' there were nightclubs , for example £ 1,150 in one night at a club called @entity134 , and he frequented @entity21 , where there was £ 19,500 spent in one night in march 2011			1
' this perhaps was some kind of celebration prior to his marriage to his wife in june 2012			0
again people are allowed to celebrate how they like of course as long as it is n’t with someone else ’s money to which they are not entitled			0
' battered to death : @entity3 was found dead in a pool of blood by a cleaner in his @entity6 home after the killing , @entity2 attempted to cover his tracks by purchasing replica clothes to replace his bloodstained ones , it is alleged			1
scientists later found blood from mr @entity3 on a briefcase @entity2 was carrying when he went to the flat that afternoon			1
@entity2 had been employed as his financial advisor in 2005 following the death of mr @entity3 's partner @entity163 , an interior designer whose clients included princess @entity165 and former @entity168 cabinet minister @entity167			1
@entity2 was to assist in the investment and management of the huge inheritance mr @entity3 received , the court was told			1
mr @entity76 said : ' it appears mr @entity3 's lifestyle , since his partner 's death , had been somewhat extravagant , in some ways had become chaotic , and included consumption of alcohol and drugs at his home address often with others			1
' mr @entity3 's habits including his dependency on others , were such as to make him an easy target for financial exploitation			1
the relationship between the two men deteriorated in the months before the murder as mr @entity3 told friends how much money @entity2 had lost him			1
mr @entity76 said : ' in the days and months before his death , mr @entity3 expressed to those close to him and others his disappointment at losses in his investments , for which he seemed to blame the defendant , his resentment at the financial arrangements in place to curb his spending and his distrust of the defendant in his management of his finances			2
' victim ' : mr @entity3 who had employed @entity2 as his financial advisor since 2005 ' whatever mr @entity3 's spending and lifestyle habits , his distrust of the defendant in that regard had a sound basis			1
' tax records showed @entity2 earned just under £ 50,000 in 2006 - 07 , £ 36,460 in 2007 - 08 and just £ 6,000 in 2008 - 09			0
mr @entity76 added : ' the reality is that with the lifestyle that he had , his legitimate earnings fell far short of what was required to keep that high life going			0
' @entity2 became a ' financial concierge ' to mr @entity3 and paid utility bills , money owed to a storage company and helped him find a flat and pay the deposit and rent			1
mr @entity76 continued : ' some concerns were raised at the bank when mr @entity3 explained that he had been providing signed blank cheques to his financial advisor , however this , so far as the late mr @entity3 understood , was for investment purposes			2
' there are very strict rules as to what access an independent financial advisor can have to a client 's finances			0
' such a situation , whether one designed from the outset or to allow for the theft of the money or one that the defendant took advantage of , allowed for stealing the money of a trusting and in some ways inadequate man			0
' @entity2 later told police he was paid £ 1,000 a week for his services in this capacity but no record of this agreement has been found			2
' between february 15 , 2010 and january 31 , 2012 a total of £ 343,000 has been paid in to bank accounts in the defendant 's name by way of cheques successfully drawn on mr @entity3 's @entity261 account , ' mr @entity76 continued			1
exclusive neighbourhood : police launched a murder investigation in @entity6 after mr @entity3 was discovered dead			2
he had been bludgeoned to death ' during the same period there had also been attempts by way of the defendant to secure payments totaling £ 80,000 to @entity2 ' accounts by way of cheques initially drawn but which bounced			0
' mr @entity3 did understand that these significant amounts would be re-invested for him by the defendant and were not therefore intended to go into the defendant 's pocket			2
' it was a deception and it worked			0
not a penny of the £ 343,000 was re-invested on mr @entity3 's behalf and it was spent by the defendant on himself and his friends			1
' mr @entity3 was found dead on march 8			2
