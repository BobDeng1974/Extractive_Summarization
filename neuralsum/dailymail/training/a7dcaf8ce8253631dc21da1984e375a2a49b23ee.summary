by @entity0 @entity2 is continuing to export millions of pounds worth of military equipment to @entity4 despite concerns @entity6 is arming separatist rebels in @entity8 , mps have warned			1
the @entity9 ( @entity10 ) have revealed that 251 export licences for the sale to @entity4 of controlled goods worth at least £ 132million remain in place			1
among the licences which remain valid are permits covering sniper rifles , night sights , small arms ammunition , gun mountings , body armour , military communications equipment and ' equipment employing cryptography '			1
despite a promise in march by the then foreign secretary @entity27 to stop military sales to @entity4 which could be used against @entity8 , the committees said that just 31 licences had been revoked			1
@entity2 is still selling more than £ 100million worth of military equipment to @entity4 despite calls for sanctions			1
among the items that are still being sent to the country are sniper rifles , ammunition and body armour the disclosure comes after prime minister @entity39 yesterday strongly criticised @entity41 countries such as @entity42 which continue to pursue defence sales to @entity4 despite @entity6 ’s backing for the separatists			1
@entity10 chairman sir @entity46 said that the relatively small number of licences which had been withdrawn exposed the weakness of mr @entity27 ’s original promise , which referred only to equipment which could be deployed against @entity8 and did not cover @entity4 ’s wider defence requirements			2
while he said that @entity2 had been in the vanguard of @entity41 countries in taking action to curb defence sales to @entity4 , it had still not gone far enough			2
' @entity4 is an authoritarian regime			2
we should have been applying a more cautious approach for some time in regard to @entity4 , ' he said			0
@entity39 ( left ) has criticised other countries for selling arms to @entity4 amid calls for tougher sanctions on the regime of @entity67 ( right ) sir @entity46 has now written to new foreign secretary @entity69 asking if he will be suspending or revoking the remaining licences			1
the @entity10 also strongly criticised the award of licences for the export of chemicals which could be used in the manufacture of chemical weapons to @entity77			0
it said the award by the previous @entity80 government of five licences for the export of sodium fluoride had been ' highly questionable ' , while the decision of the current government to issue a further two licences for sodium and potassium fluoride after the civil war had begun was irresponsible			0
it said that the current @entity85 ’s claim that it had no grounds to refuse the licences was ' grossly inaccurate '			0
the @entity10 - which is made up of the @entity95 , @entity93 , international development and business , innovation and skills committees - also expressed concern that the @entity85 had watered down its policy on the export of equipment to countries where there were concerns that it could be used for internal repression			0
it is feared @entity4 is arming @entity106 rebels in eastern @entity8 ( pictured ) , who are widely believed to be behind the shooting down of @entity110 flight @entity108 last week it said that a ' broad ' test that an export licence should not be issued if there was ' concern ' the equipment could be used for internal repression had been dropped from the latest set of @entity85 guidelines issued earlier this year			1
only the ' narrow ' test that there had to be a ' clear risk ' of repression remained			0
in evidence to the @entity10 , business secretary @entity121 insisted the policy had not changed , however the committee said that he had been ' directly contradicted ' by the @entity80 former foreign minister @entity125 who was responsible for issuing the previous set of guidelines in 2000			0
' we consider there has been a significant change of policy			0
we do n’t accept that there has been no change of policy , ' sir @entity46 said			0
a @entity2 @entity85 spokesperson said : ' this government has not approved any licences for the export of rifles or ammunition to the @entity4 military			1
' export licences for rifles and ammunitions cover hunting and sporting rifles supplied to private individuals and to authorised dealers for resale			2
' we do not believe that there is a credible risk that these weapons will be diverted for use by the @entity4 military			0

ministers promised to halt flow of arms from @entity2 to @entity4 in march this year
@entity67 *'s* regime is believed to be arming rebels fighting in eastern @entity8
but it emerged today that 251 export licences to the country remain in place
they are worth £ 132million and cover sniper rifles , ammunition and armour
