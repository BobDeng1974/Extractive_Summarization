a @entity1 nurse is suing @entity2 after she was viciously attacked by a pit bull that had left the @entity5 's training center just six days before			1
@entity6 was visiting a friend in @entity8 in september 2014 when the dog named @entity10 -- which had a documented history of aggressive behavior -- savagely bit her left arm , which has left her hand with no feeling or function			1
@entity6 filed suit in @entity8 against her friend @entity18 , the @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity2 and a rescuer who 'd previously saved the dog from being euthanized following an attack in @entity23 , @entity24 in february 2013			1
the dog had previously been sentenced to die by a @entity24 judge in february 2014 after he attacked a trainer named @entity39			2
the canine was in her care after its owner surrendered him for being ' nervous , growling and does n't like children , ' according to @entity6 's suit			1
' with the pit bull still attached to her left breast , ms. @entity39 backed into a laundry room where the dog released his grip , enabling ms. @entity39 to close the door			0
the pit bull then broke through the door and attacked ms. @entity39 a third time , latching onto her left arm and breaking it in two places , ' reads the suit as obtained by @entity60			0
despite the horrific nature of the attack and the grueling surgeries and rehabilitation the suit says @entity39 had to endure , @entity10 was rescued by the woman who 'd originally brought him to @entity39 , @entity66			2
@entity6 says @entity67 appealed to the judge , who allowed @entity10 to live so long as @entity69 's @entity19 then agreed to take the pit bull and rehabilitate it at @entity2 's center , according to the 27 - page lawsuit			1
the @entity5 , as he 's known , did not have contact with the animal in question , his lawyers say			0
however , @entity6 's suit claims his facility released the dog , which had a history of attacking people and other dogs , while knowing it was a danger ' thereafter , @entity2 and his @entity19 , agreed to take over custody and control of the pit bull and not to release it until it was " fully deemed a safe member of society , " ' reads complaint			1
however , @entity39 claims the dog owner fell behind in payments to the center and was ' entrusted it to someone with no training or experience ' on september 17 , according to the suit			0
days later , @entity6 was attacked			0
however , the @entity19 tells the @entity36 that @entity10 left the facility ' against the strong advice and objection of his trainer			2
' what 's more , @entity2 , who is named in the suit , was never in contact with the animal , they say			2
@entity6 is suing for an unknown sum			0
a call to her attorneys at @entity108 , @entity109 & @entity110 was not immediately returned .			0

@entity6 was visiting a friend in @entity20 , @entity8 when she says the dog @entity10 viciously attacked her
the suit says the dog inflicted ' disfiguring open wounds , deep muscle and tendon lacerations ' on @entity6 , who 's now seeking punitive damages
@entity10 had been sent to @entity2 's @entity19 to escape being euthanized after he 'd previously savagely attacked a @entity24 trainer
@entity6 says the center released the dog into her friend 's care *prematurely* and is suing the center , @entity2 , her friend and a previous rescuer
