by @entity0 with their friendly faces and playful natures , it may seem that wild dolphins are always friendly			0
but a bottlenose dolphin has been reported to have deliberately pushed a man underwater while he was swimming in the sea off @entity10 , in the @entity11			1
the animal is said to have ‘ lashed out ’ at the swimmer twice with its tail , prompting experts to warn swimmers to keep out of the water near the large predators			1
smiling assassin ? a bottlenose dolphin is said to have deliberately pushed a man under water who was swimming in the sea in @entity10 , @entity24			1
a local group said : ' do not confuse the shape of their jawline with a smile			0
they can cause serious injury to humans and have killed in the past			0
' a stock image is pictured the incident occurred on july 26 off @entity24 , according to a report made to the @entity36 and @entity37 ( @entity38 ) which stated that the animal acted ‘ aggressively ’			1
known as @entity41 , the adult bottlenose dolphin is thought to have come to the area from @entity43 , after spending time off the coasts of @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			1
the @entity38 said that @entity41 is a non-social solitary dolphin who does not seek out and engage with swimmers			1
the group ’s log book reads : ‘ we are aware of a report of an adult swimmer nearby in wetsuit and mask , from a yacht at anchor , being aggressively pushed underwater by the dolphin			1
they got a bit of a shock as a result			0
’ the @entity38 has now warned swimmers to exercise ‘ extreme caution ’ when attempting to interact with the powerful creatures and to respect the space of ‘ this very large , apex predator ’			1
‘ @entity38 's advice is not to get into the water with it , and to enjoy the animal from the safety of the shore or from one of the local whale watch boats or licenced ferries			2
’ ‘ bottlenose dolphins are not cute and cuddly , they are not our " friends " and nor do they benefit in any meaningful or long term way from interacting with humans			1
’ @entity41 has been observed swimming close to boats in the area , but experts claim that he is solitary and does not enjoy contact with humans			1
the incident happened on july 26 off @entity24 ( pictured on the map ) , according to a report made to the @entity36 and @entity37 , which stated that the animal acted ' aggressively ' the group told swimmers : ‘ do not confuse the shape of their jawline with a smile			1
they can and do cause serious injury to humans and have killed in the past			0
’ it is not known exactly why dolphins attack humans or large animals like porpoises as , unlike sharks , they do not eat their victim			2
an expert from the @entity38 told @entity108 that it is impossible to known if the dolphin was deliberately attacking the man , or if it was trying to play with him			2
dolphins often engage in rough play , holding each other down and giving chase , so it is possible that the dolphin was playing , but some dolphin experts claim that the creatures sometimes attack humans when they are feeling amorous			1
bottlenose dolphins can display violent mating practices where they act in groups to chase and mate with a female of their own species over weeks , whether she is interested or not			1
male dolphins are also known to fight and kill rivals and offspring , suggesting they could also turn on humans mistakenly			2
@entity130 , a @entity131 dolphin expert told the @entity132 that dozens of bites to humans have been reported and people have been pulled under the water by bottlenose dolphins , which can measure 12ft ( 3.7 metres ) long and have sharp teeth to tear fish and squid			1
a dramatic rise in killer attacks by dolphins on porpoises is baffling scientists in one of @entity147 's main breeding seas			0
the calm waters of @entity149 in @entity47 turned red in july as bottlenose dolphins killed smaller porpoises			2
marine scientists are struggling to understand why the attacks have been on the rise - with three out of the four attacks proving fatal			0
researchers at the @entity156 ( @entity156 ) said they have always known dolphins attack porpoises , but that the frequency of recent attacks is alarming			0
experts have reported stranded porpoises , and floating bodies with punctured lungs and other internal injuries , inflicted by dolphins			2
people have witnessed bottlenose dolphins repeatedly forcing porpoises under water , bashing them and throwing them in the air			1
@entity149 is home to @entity174 's largest resident population of dolphins - who share the sheltered waters with smaller harbour porpoises			0
scientist @entity179 said she had been left baffled by the recent spate of deadly attacks			0
' one possibility is that they see the porpoises as competitors for food , especially if there 's a shortage of prey in the area , ' she said			0
' although porpoises normally go for smaller prey , dolphins will eat anything			0
however there 's been no other indication recently of any shortage			0
' another theory is that a low number of females is prompting the attacks by males			0
male dolphins have been known to kill young dolphins in order to mate with the calf 's mother			2
porpoises are similar in size to a dolphin calf			0
@entity41 the dolphin ( not pictured ) is said to have ' lashed out ' at the swimmer twice with its tail , prompting experts to warn swimmers to keep out of the water			1
experts say it is impossible to tell if the animal was playing or deliberately attacking someone he said : ‘ a woman who fed a pair of dolphins and then jumped into the water to swim with them was bitten			2
'' i literally ripped my left leg out of its mouth , '' she said during her one - week stay in the hospital ’			0
just last summer , two women were taken to hospitals with injuries after they were attacked by a female dolphin known as @entity238 , off the coast of @entity240 and there have been frequent reports of the animals attacking porpoises in harbours			2
‘ such interactions between bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises are invariably aggressive and routinely result in the death of the porpoise , by blunt traumas from ramming , which can result in serious internal injuries , ’ the @entity38 said			1
‘ they [ the interactions ] are likely to be a common occurrence in all @entity255 inshore waters , where the ranges of these two coastal species overlap			0
’ @entity41 has been spotted ramming a porpoise and the group said it is ‘ another good reason why ‘ people should not swim with him or any " solitary " bottlenose dolphin ...			1
they are wild animals that should be respected as such '			0
a dramatic rise in killer attacks by dolphins on porpoises ( shown ) is baffling scientists in one of @entity147 's main breeding seas			0
the calm waters of @entity149 have been turned red in recent weeks by bottlenose dolphins killing smaller porpoises during deadly clashes			2

a dolphin is said to have ' lashed out ' at swimmer off the coast of @entity10 by using its tail and pushing the man underwater
report by @entity36 and @entity37 said animal acted ‘ aggressively ’
@entity289 was ' @entity41 ' - a solitary male from near @entity43
group has warned swimmers to keep a distance from the dolphin
this is not the first time that bottlenose dolphins have attacked humans
experts are *n't* sure why they act aggressively but think they could want to either mate with or fight people who they see as a threat
