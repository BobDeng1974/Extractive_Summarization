@entity0 will announce plans for first - time buyers to pay no stamp duty on properties worth up to £ 300,000 first - time buyers will pay no stamp duty on properties worth up to £ 300,000 and have priority in the sale of new homes under a @entity10 government , @entity0 will say today			1
mr @entity0 will say @entity10 ’s reduction in the rate of stamp duty to zero would benefit nine in ten first - time buyers – saving them up to £ 5,000 in tax			1
@entity10 claims its tax break – which would last three years – would be funded by a further squeeze on tax avoidance , higher levies on foreign buyers and cuts in tax relief for landlords who fail to keep properties up to standard			1
a @entity10 government would also change planning law to give first - time buyers who have lived in a local authority area for more than three years ‘ first call ’ on up to half of homes built locally			1
labour aides say they would have a two - month window in which to buy a home before it was made more generally available in a reform designed to overcome local opposition to housing developments			0
the policy announcements – @entity10 ’s most eye - catching so far in the campaign – are designed to counter @entity45 plans to expand help to buy loans , the right to buy for housing - association tenants and to offer 200,000 ‘ starter homes ’ , sold at a 20 per cent discount			1
they are also meant to trump chancellor @entity50 ’s reforms to stamp duty , announced late last year , which have delivered savings for 98 per cent of homebuyers			2
mr @entity50 ’s changes mean there is no stamp duty paid on the first £ 125,000 of a property purchase , 2 per cent between £ 125,000 and £ 250,000 and 5 per cent between £ 250,000 and £ 925,000			2
the changes are paid for by big hikes to duty on more expensive properties			0
speaking in @entity63 , @entity64 , mr @entity0 will warn of a housing crisis in which a severe lack of homes being built has priced millions out of the property market and left many who want to buy living in private rented accommodation			0
the rate of home ownership has slipped to its lowest for 30 years , and buy - to - let landlords and foreign investors are snapping up properties before others get a chance			0
@entity10 claims it will oversee the construction of a million homes by 2020 and introduce controversial ‘ use or lose it ’ powers ensuring developers build on land rather than hoarding it			2
local authorities will be able to levy council tax on sites which remain undeveloped to try to force developers ’ hands			0
‘ there ’s nothing more @entity91 than the dream of home ownership , starting out in a place of your own , ’ mr @entity0 will say			0
mr @entity0 will say @entity10 ’s reduction in the rate of stamp duty to zero would benefit nine in ten first - time buyers – saving them up to £ 5,000 in tax ‘ but for so many young people today that dream is fading with more people than ever renting when they want to buy , new properties being snapped up before local people get a look - in , young families wondering if this country will ever work for them			1
it is simply too expensive for so many young people to buy a home today , saving up for the deposit , paying the fees and having enough left over for the stamp duty			0
‘ so we ’re going to act so we can transform the opportunities for young working people in our country			0
for the first three years of the next @entity10 government , we will abolish stamp duty for all first - time buyers of homes under £ 300,000			1
’ shadow chancellor @entity122 insists the party ’s plan for stamp duty is ‘ fully funded ’			1
@entity126 , right , said rent control is the most effective way of destroying a city - bar bombing it the stamp - duty cut would cost £ 225million a year			0
@entity10 says it would be paid for by tackling tax avoidance by landlords , which @entity134 has calculated costs more than £ 550million each year			1
a ‘ national register of landlords ’ will mean this can be cut by at least 20 per cent , generating £ 100million , @entity10 claims			0
it would also increase tax paid by holding companies that buy @entity91 property on behalf of investors and raise stamp duty on buyers from outside the @entity146			1
the party would also cut tax relief that rogue landlords get for repairs and upkeep when their properties are not up to standard			2
landlords who let furnished properties can claim tax relief even if they are not investing in their property .			2

@entity10 ’s reduction in stamp duty would benefit nine in ten first - time buyers
tax break funded by squeeze on tax avoidance , higher levies on foreign buyers and cuts in tax relief for landlords who fail to maintain properties
@entity10 would also give the buyers ‘ first call ’ on half of homes built locally
