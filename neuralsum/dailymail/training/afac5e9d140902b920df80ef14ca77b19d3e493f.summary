at @entity25 , the @entity1 - based parents clasped a flyer for the upcoming @entity27 in @entity28 and told aap : ' @entity0 is a speaker at the conference			1

dr @entity0 believes something is amiss in the world 's skies - particularly given the disappearance of @entity66 in march			2
' maybe not all things are looked at from the right perspective , ' the cardiologist and acupuncturist said			0
' maybe other perspectives are important to investigate			0
it 's not only maybe a missile [ that downed @entity5 ] but something more			2
' if it would have been a missile , and the rebels shot down this aeroplane , they would not have handed out the black boxes			0
' it is one thing to question how the plane was brought down , but another to believe a passenger could have survived			0
the fact the @entity86 do is down to a combination of faith and science			2
