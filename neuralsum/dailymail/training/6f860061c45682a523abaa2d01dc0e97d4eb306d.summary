having both worked for the @entity5 for more than 20 years , @entity2 presenters @entity0 and @entity3 have a wealth of experience when it comes to uncomfortable exchanges			1
and while normally it 's their punitive line of questioning that sees interviewees squirm , this time the pair had listeners grimacing all by themselves in a painful bid to get down with the kids			2
taking instructions from an urban slang expert , the journalists spat the words ' bro ' , ' rude - boy ' and ' blud ' as part of their early morning broadcast			1
their conversation stemmed from @entity41 's claim that he and @entity42 are so close , the president sometimes calls him ' bro '			1
' well when i come in at 4am , i normally say to @entity0 : ' @entity46 ' , 54 - year - old @entity3 joked			1
' @entity46 , that 's right , ' @entity0 , aged 71 , joined in			1
complimented that in fact he had good ' street credentials ' by @entity31 , also known as @entity31 , @entity0 retorted : ' thanks bro			1
' later , the veteran journalist revealed where he had learnt some of the phrases tossed around in the excruciating exchange			0
' what about blud ? my son calls me blud often			2
' listeners took to @entity59 to share their amusement , with one jokingly comparing @entity0 to the @entity62 rapper @entity61			2
listeners shared their amusement after hearing the awkward exchange on @entity2 4 this morning varied panel : the presenters were joined by author of the @entity35 , @entity34 ( left ) , and @entity31 ( right ) , a @entity33 presenter the bizarre episode was sparked by @entity41 's confession that he and @entity42 are so close , the @entity62 president calls him ' bro '			1
referring to the prime minister 's boastful admission , social commentator @entity34 said he likely recognised the term as one of endearment from the @entity62 drama , the wire			2
the show , which follows @entity81 narcotics police and a network of violent drug dealers as they evade try to evade prosecution by the former , was ' very , very popular , where the prime minister grew up , he said			0
' @entity78 was really popular int hat bit of notting hill where @entity41 used to live , so there is @entity41 - a certain kind of public schoolboy with a certain kind of sensibility , thinking it 's flattering , thinking he 's cool			2
' but actually the most important thing is to stake his claim for closeness to the most powerful guy in the world , it would n't matter what he called him as long as it was tolerably intimate			0
' @entity102 is the author of the 1980s @entity104 , an observation on the etiquette and lifestyle of privileged west @entity108			0
unlike the @entity110 , @entity102 , the former style editor of @entity111 and @entity112 , said he would greet acquaintances as ' darling you			0
' rather than an opt for an urban alternative , the author said : ' i would say you or @entity120 , you			0
' @entity42 to @entity41 , i do n't think " @entity120 , you " would quite work			1
' perhaps the other way around			0
' at the end of the programme he celebrated : ' my dogs			0
. wonderful , my dogs			0
it 's wonderful that four middle - aged people would devote time to talking about this			0
' the presenters were discussing @entity41 's admission that he and @entity42 were so close , the president sometimes called him ' bro '			1

@entity3 said he greeted @entity0 as ' rudeboy ' every morning
presenters tried to get to grips with urban slang words ' *cuz* ' and ' fam '
@entity0 , 71 , admitted his *teenage* son often called him ' blud '
comes after @entity41 's claimed president @entity42 calls him ' bro '
