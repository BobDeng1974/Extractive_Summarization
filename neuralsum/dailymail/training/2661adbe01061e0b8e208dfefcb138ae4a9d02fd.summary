a group describing itself as a ' @entity2 ' to a ' corrupt police state ' has offered $ 5000 for details of @entity7 police officer @entity6 's whereabouts , @entity0 can reveal			1
officer @entity6 , 28 , has been in hiding on paid leave ever since he gunned down unarmed teenager @entity9 , 18 , on 9 august			1
now , in one of a series of incendiary tweets the @entity14 have stated , ' we are paying $ 5k cash for location of @entity17			2
real $ , no joke , no crime we just wana get his photo an ask him a few questions			2
' and though the @entity14 insist this is not a bounty on the officer 's head , the chilling offer is set in the context of a stream of violent online posts boasting of ' combat experience ' , ' stockpiling ' ammunition , cleaning out gun stores and being # @entity32			2
the @entity53 has already warned that extremist violence is ' likely '			1
typical of the reponse elicited by the offer is one follower 's demand , ' @ @entity59 that bastard off the street			0
he is a murderer running free still			0
' governor @entity61 has already declared a state of emergency and called in the @entity63 in anticipation of the violence that @entity53 agents have described as ' inevitable ' when the @entity67 charged with deciding the fate of officer @entity6 , 28 , delivers their verdict			1
having promised that a decision would be reached ' by late november ' it now seems likely that the @entity67 will return that decision this week			0
a series of @entity67 leaks , and @entity76 law which allows officers to use lethal force if they believe their life to be in danger , have led many to believe that @entity6 will not be indicted on murder charges as @entity9 's family and supporters hope			1
it is three months since @entity6 pumped six bullets into the teenager as he walked down the middle of the road with a friend			2
in the wake of the shooting which ignited racial tension in the @entity76 town rioters took to the streets armed with @entity97 cocktails and chanting the slogan ' @entity99 do n't shoot ' - a reference to some witness accounts that the teenager had his hands up in surrender when @entity6 fired off his fatal volley of shots			1
@entity107 's disturbing offer and tweets show the seething anger and hunger for violence among some agitators			2
they have no faith in the judicial system and seem intent on ignoring official calls for peaceful protest and calm			0
as reported by @entity0 that chatter has extended to @entity121 own police officers			0
writing on the forum @entity122 one user writing under the username ' a @entity126 ' advised residents , ' if you do not have a gun , get one and get one soon			0
we will not be able to protect you or your family			0
' in what appeared to be a direct strike at governor @entity61 's decision to activate the @entity63 rather than entrusting @entity121 's own force with policing the streets of @entity7 , the user continued , ' it will be your responsibility to protect them			1
our gutless commanders and politicians have neutered us			0
' i 'm serious , get a gun , get more than one , and keep one with you at all times			0
' killed : @entity9 , 18 , ( left ) was shot dead by police officer @entity6 ( right ) in @entity7 , @entity76			1
pressure point : protests on both sides of the argument over whether @entity6 should be charged with a crime for shooting unarmed @entity9 have already started in @entity7 ahead of the grand jury verdict			1
so far all have been peaceful memorial : @entity9 's high school graduation photo at one of the improvised memorials to his shooting more than three months ago			1
speaking on monday @entity121 mayor @entity161 voiced support for governor @entity61 's decision to active the @entity63			2
he said that the guard ' will be used in a secondary role ' and could potentially be stationed at places such as shopping centers and government buildings			0
he said , ' the way we view this , the guard is not going to be confronting the protesters and will not be on ( the ) front line interacting with demonstrators			0
' gun sales have been said to be increasing			0
one gun shop owner , @entity178 of @entity179 , in nearby @entity180 , told the @entity182 sales had increased from a typical 30 or 40 firearms a week to 250 this week			0
' these people are afraid.one hundred percent of them are buying because of @entity7 , ' he said			2
when violence first exploded in @entity7 and cities across the states as the @entity9 's shooting ignited underlying racial tensions in @entity76 and beyond , the @entity63 's intervention saw a visible reduction in violence			1
@entity193 had initially been tasked with policing the protests when governor @entity61 first declared a state of emergency in august			2
their tactics of enforcing curfews , lining up armored vehicles and attempting to drive protesters back with tear - gas and rubber bullets were widely criticized for only adding to tensions			0
another of the incendiary tweets posted by the militant group flashpoint : @entity207 , a supporter of police officer @entity6 , argues with critics of the police in @entity7 at a demonstration yesterday			1
larger protests are expected when the grand jury reach its verdict officers were clearly seen walking with guns un-holstered and raised towards unarmed protesters			1
the @entity63 's strategy of working with community leaders and moving among protesters rather than drawing battle lines saw a marked drop in violence			1
according to reports based on unnamed sources in the @entity226 officer @entity6 has told authorities that he realized that @entity9 and his friend matched the description of two youths involved in a theft at a convenience store just minutes before he saw them walking down the @entity233			2
he has claimed that , having passed the teenagers whom he told not to walk in the @entity235 , he then doubled back and some sort of confrontation with @entity9 occurred at his police vehicle door			0
the reports state that @entity6 claimed a struggle for his gun ensued resulting in him firing two shots and hitting @entity9 in the hand			1
when the youth tried to escape he allegedly stated that he continued to shoot , firing off the fatal volley of shots when @entity9 turned and ' charged ' back towards him			0
this account is in stark contrast with that of several eye witnesses and @entity9 's companion who have claimed that the unarmed teen had his hands up , or by his side , and begged the officer ' stop shooting			1
' @entity121 prosecutor @entity256 's office have promised to unseal and release all evidence reviewed by the @entity67 following its decision .			0

self - described ' militant *resistance* ' offers $ *5,000* to find where @entity6 is
claims they ' just wana get his photo ' but also have incendiary @entity44 feed which says ammunition will ' solve problems '
*mounting* fear of extremist violence in @entity7 when grand jury decides whether to charge @entity6 over @entity9 's shooting death
