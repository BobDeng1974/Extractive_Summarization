a new drug for men with advanced prostate cancer gives them five months ’ extra life when they have run out of options			1

trials showed men taking enzalutamide survived for more than 18 months compared with less than 14 months for those on a placebo			1
condition : doctors hope prostate cancer can be turned from a killer disease into a chronic illness ( picture posed by models ) almost half of those receiving the new drug had a better quality of life			1

‘ advanced prostate cancer is extremely difficult to treat , and it ’s taken a massive co-ordinated effort to finally bring new drugs into the pipeline , after decades where there were no options once old - style hormone treatment stopped working , ’ he said			2
‘ what we ’re seeing now is an unprecedented period of success for prostate cancer research , with four new drugs shown to extend life in major clinical trials in just two years , and several others showing promise			2
‘ it truly is a golden age for prostate cancer drug discovery and development			0
’ nearly 1,200 patients were given enzalutamide following chemotherapy			0
survival for those taking the new drug was 18.4 months on average , compared with 13.6 months for those on a placebo			1
