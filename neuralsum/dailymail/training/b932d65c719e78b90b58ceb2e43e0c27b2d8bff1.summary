by @entity0 published : 04:34 est , 8 april 2013 updated : 06:24 est , 8 april 2013 ' risk inherent part of job ' : chief constable @entity3 , of the @entity4 , has criticised a decision by an officer to demand compensation from a garage owner after injuring herself on a 999 call a chief constable today added his voice to growing anger over the @entity15 compensation case by saying it was ' wholly inappropriate ' for police officers to make claims against victims of crime			1
@entity3 , of the @entity4 , spoke out after @entity21 was criticised for taking legal action against a petrol station owner after she tripped on a kerb answering a 999 call			1
it comes after home secretary @entity28 stepped into the row over the weekend by ordering a review of all such compensation cases involving the police			1
@entity21 is making a claim against @entity34 , 50 , the owner of @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity37 , for failing to ensure she was ' reasonably safe ' when she attended a suspected break - in in august 2012			2
after her astonishing claim became public , her own chief constable , @entity41 , criticised it as ‘ surprising and disappointing ’			1
mr @entity3 told @entity46 's @entity45 programme : ' it is , to me , wholly inappropriate that police officers claim compensation against victims of crime , people to whom we have responded in order to help them			1
' however , there are occasions , and i think many members of the public would accept and understand this , when an officer is badly assaulted on duty and loses earnings as a result ; then it may be that they should have access to the criminal injuries compensation scheme along with everybody else			0
' mr @entity3 , who is chief constable of the @entity70 force , added : ' i think it is self - evident that risk is an inherent part of being a police officer and when police officers join they absolutely know that and are aware of it			1
' in fact , it is one of the appeals of the job that police officers put themselves between harm and victims , and that 's what we do			2
' there are occasions when officers unfortunately will be injured as a result of the profession they have chosen and it is in those circumstances when the issue of compensation arises			0
' centre of national row : @entity101 ( pictured with her father @entity102 on her first day as a police officer ) has been criticised for taking legal action against a petrol station owner after she tripped on a kerb on a 999 call accident scene : the petrol station in @entity36 , @entity37 , where @entity110 @entity15 tripped on the kerb while responding to a 999 call sources say mrs may fears that the trend for officers to sue could deter victims from reporting crimes			1
mrs may ’s action follows not only the @entity15 case , but an incident where a policeman is suing a burglary victim for £ 10,000 after allegedly falling into a drain while investigating a break - in at @entity126 , @entity127			1
@entity129 @entity128 is claiming against shop - owner @entity130 for ‘ loss of overtime ’ despite being on full pay throughout			2
mrs may will ask for a review of such cases when she returns to work from holiday today			2
she is said to believe it is unreasonable for police to demand compensation for minor injuries in their normal line of duty , and their right to sue burglary victims for injuries sustained while chasing criminals may now be curbed			2
critical : @entity21 's own chief constable , @entity41 ( left ) , described her claim as ‘ surprising and disappointing ’ , while home secretary @entity28 has ordered a review of police compensation cases a @entity153 source said : ‘ it seems wrong that a pc should sue someone who reports a crime for a minor injury			1
there would be serious concerns if it deterred people from reporting crimes			0
‘ similarly , common sense tells you that owing to the nature of their work , police may suffer a few cuts and bruises			0
it would be wrong for them to put in a claim for compensation every time this happens			0
‘ the victims of crime have the right to be treated as such , not turned into criminals themselves			0
’ @entity179 is also demanding compensation from her own force after she was in a police car which skidded off the road and ended on its side during a chase in january last year			1
she put in a compensation claim to @entity188 , which would not discuss details			0
her lawyers said she injured her knee and her employers accepted liability			0
another claim : @entity21 is also demanding compensation from her own force after she was in a police car like this one which skidded off the road and ended on its side during a chase in january last year her lawyers , @entity202 , said : ‘ @entity15 believes she has the right to go to work and not be harmed by someone else ’s negligence			1
’ the @entity208 is backing @entity179 ’s action against mr @entity21 , who is not related to the officer			2
it says she wants to claw back ‘ lost earnings ’			0
but it is understood she has lost only overtime and night shift pay as she was on a full salary while recovering from both incidents			0
@entity179 is on sick leave but is due back on active duty soon			0
a total of £ 67.1 million has been paid out to injured officers in settlements in the four years from 2009 to 2012 , figures from the federation showed .			0
