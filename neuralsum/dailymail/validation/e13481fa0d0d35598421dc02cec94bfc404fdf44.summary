following the birth of @entity1 , the @entity2 described the experience of becoming a first - time grandfather as ‘ a unique moment in anyone ’s life ’			1

the framed image of the 66 - year - old and @entity1 took pride of place on a table in the background of a newly released video clip , which the @entity2 released to support the world 's biggest environmental event , @entity24			1
in the video , @entity33 speaks about why we should join in with the annual @entity24 and turn off our lights this weekend			1

’ a source told the @entity90 's @entity89 : ‘ @entity80 has rather taken over , dictating when @entity1 naps , when and what he eats			1
all in all , behaving like she ’s @entity93 @entity80			0
’ it is certainly true there have been few , if any , trips to @entity33 ’s @entity98 home highgrove over the past year			1

the video comes in the same month as reports that @entity33 is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young @entity2 's life most of @entity47 and @entity12 ’s time is spent at their @entity111 home , @entity112 , on the @entity93 ’s @entity114 estate , where the @entity2 has been busy revising for his @entity115			1
