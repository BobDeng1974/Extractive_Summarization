known as ‘ face characters , ’ the princesses not only have to look the part , they need to remember quotes from their movies , stay in character at all times , and know how to sing and dance			1
a former @entity7 actress , known only as @entity21 user doublenn recently held an @entity23 session in which she revealed how tough it can be working at @entity3			1

first the girls are checked to see which character they could potentially look like , then follow several other tests including dancing , acting in character and an interview			0
there are certain height restrictions involved as a @entity28 princess is typically between 5ft 4inches and 5ft 7inches , although for fairies such as @entity9 , @entity8 and @entity45 must be more petite - between 4ft 11inches and 5ft 2inches			1
age is another important factor			0
most girls are between 18 and 23 , some last until they are 27 , but it is almost unheard off for a princess or fairy to be played by someone over 27			0
@entity28 face characters are required to stay in character at all times and always smile once chosen , the lucky actors go through an intensive five day training course during which they study @entity28 movies so they can quote lines said by their character			1
each day requires a lot of preparation for the actor to become their character			0
@entity66 told @entity21 that it would take her an hour to get read , including 20 minutes just putting on @entity7 ’s dress			0
throughout the day she was then required to touch - up her makeup to ensure she always looked her best			0
@entity66 also revealed that being a face character is n’t a lucrative career and during her time as @entity7 she started on $ 13.50 an hour which increased to $ 16			1
actors playing @entity28 princesses go through a tough selection process and their careers are over before they become 27 @entity28 also has lots of rules for its actors to follow , with the main one being that princesses need to remain in character at all time			1
other rules include not being allowed to sit down while working , always smiling , always doing the character 's voice			0
@entity66 revealed that as a result of straining her voice to sound more like @entity7 over several years she developed inoperable vocal nodes			2

those lucky enough to be selected are expected to remain in character at all time
