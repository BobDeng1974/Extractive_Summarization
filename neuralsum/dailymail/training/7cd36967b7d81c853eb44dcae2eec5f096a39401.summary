by @entity0 published : 16:46 est , 10 december 2012 updated : 02:49 est , 11 december 2012 it 's a cold enough night for two young women walking a @entity4 dog to be wrapped up in thick winter coats and warm wooly hats			1
but the pair are not two dog lovers braving bracing temperatures to take their beloved pet for a winter walk			0
the callous pair were in fact captured on @entity14 abandoning the starved animal in bitterly cold conditions outside a @entity18 hotel			2
the clip shows the two women approaching a gated area outside the hotel shortly after 8pm			0
one of the women appears to spot the cctv camera and begins to back away , but after a short conversation with her accomplice leads the dog towards the gated area and begins to tie the lead to the metal fencing while the second woman looks on			2
eventually , her accomplice , thought by @entity21 inspectors to be heavily pregnant , comes to help her friend tie the dog up			1
the pair look at the camera again and seem to weigh up the risks of being caught abandoning the dog before they hastily retreat , closing a gate behind them			0
an @entity21 inspector described the animal , later named hero when he was found by pub staff , as ' one of the thinnest ' dogs he had seen as the charity appealed for help in finding the pair			0
callous : the pair , dressed in warm winter clothes , appeared to back off into the darkness when they spotted the @entity14 camera caught on camera : one of the women decides that it is worth the risk of getting caught to abandon the dog and begins to tie its lead to a gate post help : the second woman , thought to be heavily pregnant , comes to the aid of her friend as she struggles with the dog lead escape : after looking at the cctv camera once more , the pair make off closing a gate behind them as they go the emaciated dog weighed less than half the normal body weight of a dog his size when he was handed over to the charity			1
inspector @entity94 said : ' this poor dog was completely emaciated , one of the thinnest dogs i have seen			0
' a male adult rottweiler should weigh 50 - 60 kgs but this dog weighed just 22 kgs			1
' he was simply starving and now all he wants to do is eat			0
' the @entity21 appealed for anyone who recognises the women to call 0300 1234 999			2
do you know them ? women abandon starving dog			1

@entity21 inspectors released footage of the women *ditching* the starving dog in @entity33 , @entity18
