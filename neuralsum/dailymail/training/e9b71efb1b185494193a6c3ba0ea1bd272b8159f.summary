there is a lot more money to be made from the captaincy of a club as huge as @entity5 if the armband goes to a shooting star rather than a natural - born leader with an unselfishly over-riding perspective of the game			1
hence the agents of @entity12 and @entity13 have been doing everything in their power to press the claims of their respective clients			1
since the @entity20 tyrant does not like being told what to do by anyone – least of all we media hacks - he would be wise consult the evidence before bringing the curse of the celebrity skipper down upon @entity28			2
just to remind @entity5 ’s new manager - the final was won by @entity46 under the concentrated leadership of defender @entity48 , not @entity49 while @entity50 was obsessing over his vain attempt to rediscover the form which used to make him the world ’s best footballer			1
had @entity56 been @entity49 ’s captain he would have had the authority to tell dear little @entity58 to pull his finger out			2
just in case @entity61 has forgotten , @entity60 was captain of his @entity20 team which enjoyed a goal - spree in the group phase but then dried up as it stumbled into that dire semi-final against @entity49			1
by way of further study , let me refer him to @entity71 past			0
of the 19 winning skippers in the tournament ’s history , only one can be categorised as a glamorous goalscorer			2
and that , my brother @entity76 , was an old friend of ours who just happens to be the greatest player ever to captain his country			2
@entity82 raised his hand of @entity84 to victory in @entity86 86			0
but did n’t @entity87 captain the 1970 @entity43 who remain the best team of all time ? er , no , that would be @entity92			2
so what about @entity94 for the only @entity96 glory in @entity97 98 ? no , that was @entity99			0
it was @entity101 and @entity102 not @entity103 for @entity43 in 1994 and 2002 …			0
. @entity104 not @entity105 for @entity49 78 … … @entity109 not @entity107 and @entity108 not @entity106 or @entity110 for @entity111 in 1982 and 2006			0
captaincy in football may not seem as obviously important as in cricket and rugby but it is a serious business			0
so serious that after @entity82 probably the highest profile personalities to raise the @entity42 aloft are the two greatest defenders of all time , men who were deeply perceptive readers of the game and who took leadership by example and inspiration very seriously indeed : @entity124 and @entity125			1
victorious leader : @entity48 ( left ) captained @entity46 to a @entity42 final win over @entity50 's @entity49 the glitterati who have fallen short as captains at the very highest level is long and revealing			1
as well as @entity50 and @entity60 it includes @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity103 now , @entity136 ’s @entity135 twice and the man who has cashed in most spectacularly on the armband … @entity140 ’s very own @entity139			1
it is the mega-millions banked by @entity139 which most excites the commercial representatives of @entity12 and @entity60			1
@entity143 , @entity5 ’s @entity144 , has been @entity140 ’s best skipper since @entity125 but like this country ’s only @entity42 winner he reigned before the sponsorship , endorsement and advertising markets exploded			1
now there appears to be no limit to the fortunes achievable through the honour of captaining @entity5			1
whether that will extend to winning trophies for the club is less certain			0
water carrier : the captain of @entity159 in 1998 was n't the star @entity94 but @entity99 ( right ) @entity60 is a wonderful striker but he does not carry the bearing of a leader , so immersed is he in his own game			1
for @entity61 to appoint his fellow @entity20 would smack of favouritism			0
@entity12 is united ’s , as well as @entity140 ’s , best player and a dynamic goalscorer in his own right			1
but while he does throw himself into the team effort he does so in a frenzied manner rather than with a deep understanding of the direction in which his endeavours might best be directed			0
and some at the club will never forget that he wanted to quit @entity28 until @entity5 offered him even bigger bucks to stay			1
frankly , unhappy though both of them may well be if passed over , they would better left to get on with the job they do best – that of winning rather than controlling matches			0
strong captain : @entity182 was skipper at @entity5 until his departure for @entity184 in the summer the coming to such a conclusion is further complicated for @entity61 by the current absence of a strong candidate for the captaincy			1
@entity182 and @entity189 have gone from @entity28 and others are about to follow			0
if @entity191 , recently club captain without team portfolio at @entity193 , is brought in he could be one answer			2
if @entity195 is fully fit , he should be a strong contender			0
but how @entity5 must wish they , not their great @entity197 rivals @entity196 , had bought @entity200 – a captain by more than name if ever there was one			1
@entity203 should just let his bowling do the talking times have changed since cricketers used to tell opposing batsmen they had just enjoyed group sex with their mothers and that their sisters were whores and it was all considered just part of the game			0
changed not least because the f - word and the c - word are now audible and visible on television			2
changed because cricketers are now higher - earning public figures than they used to be and with the money and fame comes responsibility			1
let the ball do the work : @entity203 ( right ) snarls after dismissing his nemesis @entity224 jumping for joy : @entity203 leaps into the air as he enjoys taking the wicket of @entity228 changed because it is more important than ever to set an example to youngsters which rises above the gutter , not sinks into it			0
so no , whatever the good old boys in the commentary box chunter on about , it was not acceptable for @entity203 to behave like a borstal school - yard bully , even though he got off that misconduct charge			2
@entity203 has just proved to himself , by taking three wickets in the first innings demolition of his @entity243 protagonists , that he can be just as deadly with the ball without hurling foul - mouthed insults in its wake			0
hopefully the change in his behaviour is permanent – and we can all settle down to enjoy watching @entity140 win @entity251 matches like this one .			0

there 's a lot of money to be made from being @entity5 captain
best skippers often are n't superstar players - look at @entity42 winners
example of @entity139 excites the agents of @entity12 and @entity60
