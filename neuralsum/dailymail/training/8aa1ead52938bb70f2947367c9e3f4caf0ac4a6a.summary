physicists have succeeded in chilling molecules to the coldest temperature ever reported			1
the experiment lowered the temperature of selected molecules to 2.5 thousands of a degree above absolute zero			1
and the result could prompt new research in areas ranging from quantum chemistry to tests of the most basic theories in particle physics			1
scientists at @entity16 have created the world 's coldest molecules			1
based in @entity20 the experiment chilled them to almost absolute zero			1
it is the coldest temperature ever recorded for any molecule			1
pictured here is an optical cavity used to precisely fine - tune lasers that then trapped and cooled the molecules the research , published in the journal nature , was conducted by scientists at @entity16 in @entity20			1
it involved dropping the temperature of strontium monofluoride with lasers in a process known as magneto - optical trapping ( @entity36 )			2
at almost absolute zero ( -273.15 ° c or -459.67 ° ) they are the coldest molecules ever achieved through direct cooling , representing a physics milestone			1
‘ we can start studying chemical reactions that are happening at very near to absolute zero , ’ said dr @entity41 , a @entity16 physics professor and principal investigator			2
‘ we have a chance to learn about fundamental chemical mechanisms			0
’ magneto - optical trapping has become very popular with atomic physicists in the past generation - but only at the single - atom level			0
absolute zero is the lowest possible temperature where nothing could be colder and no heat energy remains in a substance			2
absolute zero can be quantified as -273.15 @entity58 or simply 0 @entity59			0
this experiment marks the coldest recorded temperature for molecules , which are groups of two or more atoms			1
the technology uses lasers to simultaneously cool particles and hold them in place			0
' imagine having a shallow bowl with a little molasses in it , ' dr @entity41 explained			0
' if you roll some balls into the bowl , they will slow down and accumulate at the bottom			0
' for our experiment , the molecules are like the balls and the bowl with molasses is created via laser beams and magnetic fields			1
' the results could prompt new research into areas such as quantum chemistry			1
magneto - optical trapping has become very popular with atomic physicists in the past generation - but only at the single - atom level			0
this marks the coldest recorded temperature for molecules ( illustration shown ) , groups of two or more atoms magneto - optical trapping involves holding molecules in place with lasers			1
in so doing the physicists were able to cool the molecules to a fraction of a degree above aboslute zero ( artist 's illustration shown ) until now , the complicated vibrations and rotations of molecules proved too difficult for such trapping			1
the @entity16 team 's unique approach drew inspiration from a relatively obscure , 1990s research paper that described @entity36 - type results in a situation where the usual cooling and trapping conditions were not met			1
pulses of strontium monofluoride ( @entity121 ) were shot out from a cryogenic chamber to form a beam of molecules , which is slowed by pushing on it with a laser			2
' it 's like trying to slow down a bowling ball with ping pong balls , ' dr @entity41 explained			0
' you have to do it fast and do it a lot of times			0
' the slowed molecules enter a specially - shaped magnetic field , where opposing laser beams pass through the center of the field , along three perpendicular axes			2
this is where the molecules become trapped and subsequently cooled			0
' @entity145 allows us to both cool things down and apply force that leaves the molecules levitating in an almost perfect vacuum , ' dr @entity41 added			2
dr @entity41 and his colleagues built their own apparatus in a basement lab. it is an elaborate , multi-level tangle of wires , computers , electrical components , tabletop mirrors and a cryogenic refrigeration unit			0
the process uses a dozen lasers , each controlled to extremely high precision			0
' if you wanted to put a picture of something high - tech in the dictionary , this is what it might look like , ' dr @entity41 said			0
' it 's deeply orderly , but with a bit of chaos			0
' the @entity16 team chose strontium monofluoride for its structural simplicity - it has effectively just one electron that orbits around the entire molecule			2
' we thought it would be best to start applying this technique with a simple diatomic molecule [ those composed of only two atoms ] , ' dr @entity41 said			0
the discovery opens the door for further experimentation into everything from precision measurement and quantum simulation to ultracold chemistry and tests of the standard model of particle physics .			2
