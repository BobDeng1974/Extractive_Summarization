@entity0 may have had a long break working on his batting with his old mentor @entity3 but his technical problems very much remain			0
the @entity6 captain , without an international century for almost two years , failed for the second time in the first test as his old failing against the full ball just outside off - stump was again exploited by @entity10			1
to compound @entity0 ’s misery , there was also another failure for @entity14 , who has endured a nightmare return to the @entity6 team for his 50th test , 18 months after the trauma of leaving the @entity20 tour following his 49th			1
the double blow at the start of @entity6 ’s second innings left them with much to do in this first test to work their way towards a winning position at the sir @entity29 even though they earned a first - innings lead of 104			2
@entity0 simply can not afford many more mistakes , with new @entity35 chairman @entity34 demanding victory here over opposition in @entity10 he condemned as ‘ mediocre ’ ahead of this trip			1
@entity0 returned to something like his best last year with three half - centuries in his last four @entity17 innings against @entity43 but his woeful one - day form in @entity45 led @entity6 to jettisoning him as 50 - over captain ahead of the @entity47			1
he arrived in the @entity48 still smarting from that blow but with a slightly altered technique and looked refreshed in scoring a warm - up hundred against @entity52			0
the step up to @entity17 level , however , has seen @entity0 struggling and @entity55 looked anything but mediocre in sending both him and @entity14 back with just 20 on the board as @entity6 endured a rocky start to their second innings			1
@entity14 has been recalled in the unaccustomed role of opener but has looked jittery in scoring a duck and now four and was noticeably falling over in the crease as he edged a decent ball from @entity55 to @entity65			0
@entity0 failed with the bat once again on day three of the first test in @entity68 @entity14 was also out cheaply as the first three wickets once again fell for not many @entity70 earlier picked up four wickets as @entity6 bowled @entity10 out for 295 in their first innings it is far too early to say that @entity6 ’s gamble in bringing back a man who left @entity76 with what was later diagnosed as ‘ situational anxiety ’ has backfired but @entity14 will be under significant pressure in the second test			1
@entity0 ’s problems have been going on much longer and it is no exaggeration to say that he will be fighting for his job for the rest of this three - match series , particularly with change sweeping through @entity88 cricket			0
here he pushed forward hesitantly to a ball he could have left alone from @entity55 and succeeded only in edging to the delighted @entity90 at slip on 13 after falling for 11 in the first innings			0
and when @entity93 , a centurion in the first innings , was run out after a dreadful mix - up with @entity96 , @entity6 had again lost early wickets and were struggling on 52 for three , only 156 ahead			1
@entity10 were very much in the game then but @entity99 and @entity100 settled any @entity88 nerves with an unbroken stand of 64 which gives them a lead of 220 and puts them in what should be a decisive position			2
earlier @entity6 had toiled before dismissing @entity10 for 295 , with the unlikely figure of @entity70 finishing with four for 47 but @entity109 only being able to claim one more victim to remain one short of sir @entity113 ’s @entity6 record of 383 test wickets			1
@entity115 was the first wicket to fall on day three as he was caught by @entity117 off @entity70 @entity118 celebrates after claiming the wicket of @entity65 to leave @entity10 on 227 for six @entity120 celebrates his maiden test match century in his sixth test match @entity0 has now gone 61 combined test and odi innings without making a century			1
his last ton for @entity6 came against @entity126 at @entity127 in may 2013 , 690 days ago			0
@entity6 fought long and hard before they decided to bring @entity70 on this tour and considered @entity130 ’s @entity129 and even his veteran team - mate @entity131 before they plumped for the likeable yeoman of @entity133			2
@entity137 ’s absence gave an opportunity to an off - spinner who could not even get into @entity133 ’s championship team last season , the promise of @entity135 being preferred to him , and @entity70 had to go on loan to @entity144 to get a game			0
yet @entity70 is reliable , steady and under - stated and @entity6 knew he would not let them down when they preferred him to the more naturally talented but inconsistent @entity146 for this first test			2
the 23 - year - old @entity148 scored 112 from 220 deliveries to drag @entity10 up to 295 from their first innings @entity120 takes off his helmet and raises his bat to celebrate a first century in international cricket @entity100 makes the catch to dismiss @entity90 , who was the last wicket to fall in @entity10 ' innings @entity120 is a 23 - year - old @entity148 middle - order batsman playing in his sixth test match			1
what kind of batsman is he ? he ’s a very aggressive player — he hit @entity70 for six off his second ball of the innings — but perfectly capable of a well - worked innings			2
@entity120 has passed 50 four times in his first six tests , including 56 and 63 against @entity126 and @entity165 respectively , not to mention his unbeaten 112			0
anything else i need to know ? @entity70 is n’t the first @entity17 bowler @entity120 has hit over the rope at the start of his innings			1
the batsman hit @entity173 for four and six in his second over against @entity126			0
it will be difficult for @entity6 to leave him out now , even though @entity137 will join the squad in @entity177 in time for the second test , particularly if @entity70 can spin them to victory on this slow @entity181 pitch			2
it was @entity70 who made the first breakthrough of the day for @entity6 and the most important one in persuading the limpet - like @entity115 to chip tamely to extra cover in an off - side dominated field			2
that should have opened the door for @entity6 but they needed to be patient until the last three @entity191 fell in 11 balls to a combination of @entity70 , @entity109 and sharp work from @entity118 to run out @entity55			1
throughout it all the diminutive figure of @entity120 stood firm for @entity10 to go to his maiden hundred in his sixth test with thrilling but often risky stroke - making			1
@entity120 severely tried the patience of @entity117 , who could have had him three times but ended up wicketless as the 23 - year - old @entity148 finished unbeaten on 112			0
@entity55 celebrates dismissing @entity14 for just four after he edged behind to @entity65 @entity14 added a score of four to his first innings duck in his first test since returning after an 18 month absence @entity14 makes his way off the field after a disappointing first test back in the @entity6 team captain cook also fell cheaply as he was out for 13 after edging a @entity55 delivery into the slips @entity93 also lost his wicket late on the third evening as @entity6 's first three wickets fell for just 52 runs @entity215 on will have to wait until @entity10 ’ second innings to beat @entity113 ’s record @entity218 haul of 383			1
the @entity221 fast bowler took 2 for 67 in the first innings — after @entity223 was caught behind on tuesday , @entity109 dismissed tail - ender @entity90 with a length ball deflected to short leg			0
@entity90 was @entity109 ’s first wicket caught at short leg since @entity126 ’s @entity228 at @entity229 in 2008 — his 78th test wicket			0
it was @entity120 who was reprieved by @entity232 on the second evening when he was caught at slip and it was the same man who survived when he was dropped by the diving @entity70 on 43 and then when he edged @entity117 through the vacant second slip on 80			0
for @entity109 this was another frustrating day , with little reverse swing on offer , but he did move a big step closer to the record when he had last man @entity90 caught by @entity100 at short leg			0
yet the ultimate @entity88 frustration belonged to @entity0 and @entity14 .			0

@entity6 closed day three of the first test on *********116********* for three , 220 runs ahead
@entity10 were bowled out for 295 in their first innings
