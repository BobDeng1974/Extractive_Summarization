@entity0 have just splashed out £ 60million on @entity1 , but it is unlikely sir @entity3 would have sanctioned such a move after the former manager 's ‘ difficult ’ time managing @entity6			1
@entity3 wrote of his troubles handling @entity8 in his autobiography , saying the midfield star did n't make an effort to learn @entity12			1
@entity8 arrived at @entity13 in 2001 for a then @entity15 record transfer fee of £ 28.1m but struggled to adapt to the @entity17 top flight and was moved on to @entity18 after just two years			1
clash : sir @entity3 wrote in his autobiography of difficulties managing @entity6 players such as @entity8 , who spent two seasons at @entity0 between 2001 and 2003 big money buy : @entity0 have splashed out £ 60m on @entity6 @entity1 as @entity25 ( right ) seeks to strengthen his under - performing squad high point : there were glimpses of @entity8 's class at @entity0 , such as this goal in the @entity32 against @entity33 in 2002 , but overall his time in @entity35 was a disappointment @entity3 wrote : ' i confess i found working with @entity6 footballers quite difficult			1
there was deep patriotism towards @entity6			2
‘ they always had the flag round them			0
i had no problem with that , but the ones i managed did n't try particularly hard to speak @entity17			0
‘ with @entity8 it was just , “ mister ”			2
' now , @entity0 have broken the transfer record again to bring in @entity1 and @entity25 is hoping he performs rather better and @entity3 's words of warning are misguided			1
no better : @entity8 was moved on to @entity18 for £ 15m but struggled to find form there too wizard : @entity0 will hope @entity1 can translate his best form for @entity55 at @entity13 tall order : @entity57 has made @entity1 part of a comprehensive overhaul of his @entity0 squad @entity61 joins @entity63 's @entity17 exodus @entity1 is part of an expensive overhaul of the @entity0 squad as they aim to recover from a poor start to the season			1
he will be the 50th @entity6 player to turn out in the @entity70 and the fourth at @entity0 after @entity8 , @entity72 and @entity73			1
left - back @entity72 spent three seasons at @entity0 between 2004 and 2007 , playing 83 matches and scoring five times			0
he grew frustrated with a lack of regular action and demanded a move to @entity81			0
@entity0 rejected the bid and @entity72 eventually joined @entity55			0
@entity6 connection : defender @entity72 spent three seasons at @entity0 on target : @entity73 scored 34 goals for @entity0 in his two seasons with the club @entity73 played for two seasons at @entity13 , making a total of 99 appearances and scoring 34 goals			2
signed on a two - year loan following a protracted transfer saga with @entity94 and his management company , @entity73 was never offered a permanent deal and moved to @entity97 in 2009			0
the first @entity6 in the @entity70 arrived around 1998 , with @entity98 at @entity99 and @entity100 at @entity101			2
since then , some like @entity103 at @entity97 and @entity104 at @entity94 and @entity81 have played in @entity17 with great success			0
it remains to be seen whether @entity1 can live up the expectations that come with his expensive price tag			0
success story : @entity6 @entity103 has been a smash hit at @entity97 @entity103 – @entity97 – 2011 – @entity111 – @entity112 – 2010 – 11 @entity113 – @entity112 , @entity114 – 2000 – 03 , 2005 – 09 @entity115 – @entity116 – 2000 – 02 @entity117 – @entity118 – 2012 – 14 @entity119 – @entity120 – 2011 – 12 @entity121 – @entity122 – 2010 – 11 @entity123 – @entity124 – 1998 – 99 @entity98 – @entity125 – 1998 – 2002 @entity126 – @entity127 – 1998 – 99 @entity128 – @entity116 – 2008 – 09 , 2010 – @entity129 – @entity116 – 2000 – 01 @entity130 – @entity18 – 2003 – 04 , 2005 – 06 @entity131 – @entity132 – 2005 – 06 @entity133 – @entity97 – 2013 – @entity134 – @entity18 , @entity135 , @entity122 – 2008 – 13 @entity136 – @entity137 – 2011 – 13 , 2014 – @entity138 – @entity139 – 2003 – 04 @entity140 – @entity135 – 2011 – 12 @entity141 – @entity125 – 1999 – 2000 @entity142 – @entity143 – 2012 – @entity144 – @entity116 , @entity118 – 2008 – 09 , 2010 – @entity72 – @entity0 – 2004 – 07 @entity145 – @entity146 – 2002 – 03 @entity147 – @entity81 – 2006 – 10 @entity148 – @entity101 – 2013 – @entity149 – @entity114 – 1999 – 2004 @entity104 – @entity94 , @entity81 – 2006 – 11 @entity150 – @entity151 – 2008 – 09 @entity152 – @entity81 – 2006 – 07 @entity153 – @entity81 – 2004 – 05 @entity154 – @entity155 – 2001 – 02 @entity156 – @entity81 – 2009 – 12 @entity157 – @entity146 – 2002 – 04 @entity158 – @entity94 – 2005 – 06 @entity159 – @entity112 – 2013 – 2014 @entity160 – @entity161 – 2004 – 05 , 2013 – @entity162 – @entity163 – 2011 – 12 @entity100 – @entity101 – 1998 – 04 @entity73 – @entity94 , @entity0 , @entity97 – 2006 – 13 @entity164 – @entity165 – 2014 – @entity166 – @entity112 – 2013 – @entity8 – @entity0 , @entity18 – 2001 – 04 @entity167 – @entity125 – 2007 – 08 @entity168 – @entity124 – 1998 – 2001 @entity169 – @entity151 – 2012 – @entity170 – @entity97 – 2008 – @entity171 – @entity139 , @entity94 – 2007 – 08 , 2014 – @entity172 – @entity125 – 2001 – 02			1
