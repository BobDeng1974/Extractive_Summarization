@entity3 could be ready to join the @entity4 within just 10 years , @entity2 peer @entity0 claimed today			1
anti-austerity protests are sweeping across @entity6 amid speculation of further bailouts for the troubled single currency			1
but in a remarkable prediction branded ‘ breathtaking ’ by @entity11 , @entity0 claimed the problems would be sorted out soon ‘ in fits and starts ’ and a new ' eurozone @entity13 ' would emerge which the @entity3 people will want to join			1
lord @entity0 today said @entity3 's interests risk being ignored if it chose not to join a @entity14 @entity13 the former @entity20 and @entity2 cabinet minister said the battle to secure the future of the single currency will mean a ' more powerful political and institutional framework of policy and decision - making ' emerging in @entity27			1
he added : ' now if that is successful - over the next five to ten years , not over the next five to ten months - i think it is possible , quite possible that @entity3 will want to review its relationship to the eurozone core			1
' in those circumstances , i think we would have to revert to the @entity3 people again and ask them to take a view on what sort of relationship @entity3 has with @entity6 in the coming decades			2
' @entity38 has faced growing calls for an in - out referendum on @entity3 ’s membership of the @entity42			0

in may lord @entity0 said a referendum was needed as a ‘ healthy means of re-establishing a consensus ’ on @entity3 ’s place in the world			0
but today he made clear he still believes that @entity3 should move closer to the @entity42 to stop its interests being ignored			2
' what we do n’t want to see is that as the eurozone integrates further , our interests are progressively ignored			0
@entity60 mp @entity59 today said @entity0 's enthusiasm for @entity3 to join the euro was ' breathtaking ' ' we are deliberately putting ourselves in a position where we are choosing not to act constructively , not to engage with our @entity6 partners and inviting them to ignore what we believe are our interests and how we want to see the single market managed in the future			1
' that ’s the great danger of the direction in which the government is presently going , ' he told @entity74 ’s today programme			0
however , the idea of @entity3 joining the @entity4 brought a furious response from senior @entity60 backbencher @entity59			1
‘ he wants @entity3 to be to be in the core in the euro and it is breathtaking that this man can [ come ] on your programme and not be questioned about the disaster which he advocated , he advocated this euro			2
’ mr @entity59 added : ‘ he very mellifluously tries to reassure you we can just lie back and let @entity6 develop			0
‘ i think the moment has probably passed where we can determine the direction of @entity6 , that passed us all 20 years ago			0
‘ but we can determine our relationship with @entity6 and the vast majority of the @entity3 people do not want to go anywhere near the core			0
