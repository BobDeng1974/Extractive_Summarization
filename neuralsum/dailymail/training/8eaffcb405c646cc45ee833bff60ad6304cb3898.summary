the @entity1 mp who organised a @entity3 - themed stag do for a friend and then tried to downplay his role in planning the party , last night announced he would step down at the next election			1
@entity8 was allowed to remain as mp for @entity9 after pictures were published in the @entity11 of him attending the distasteful event – despite a party inquiry last month which called his actions ‘ stupid and offensive ’			1
the @entity16 graduate always insisted that the stag do , which took place two years ago in the @entity20 ski resort of @entity21 , was not anti-semitic			1
but it later emerged that – as the best man – he had bought a @entity3 uniform for the groom			2
and he did not leave straight after the meal as he initially told the inquiry , but went on to a local bar with the group			0
labour frontbencher @entity45 said : ' it shows huge weakness that @entity24 was n't prepared to take action against his disgraced mp , but it 's right that @entity8 has finally done the right thing in stepping down			0
' after his behaviour at a stag party where a @entity3 uniform was worn and the names of @entity3 leaders were chanted , his position was completely untenable			1
' mr @entity8 takes a seat at the stag party alongside his friend in the @entity3 uniform mr @entity8 was apparently unaware that donning the outfit was an offence in @entity20 , the document claimed			1
he also said the choice of costume was inspired by the @entity66 comic association with aspects of the war ’ and denied any ‘ political motivation ’			2
guests chanted ‘ @entity73 , @entity73 , @entity73 ’ , while one raised a toast to the ‘ @entity3 ’ during the dinner party in december 2011 , a police tribunal in @entity72 heard			1
mr @entity8 has repeatedly courted controversy , condemning the @entity77 and taking a phone call while on a visit to @entity80 mr @entity8 later visited @entity80 concentration camp but courted more controversy when he was seen using his mobile phone there			0
mr @entity8 was sacked as a ministerial aide at the @entity86 when the details of the party in the ski resort of @entity21 emerged			2
the groom was wearing the uniform and guests made toasts to the @entity3			2
in 2012 he caused more upset when he condemned the opening ceremony of the @entity77 as ' leftie multicultural cr * p '			1
he wrote on @entity97 : ' the most leftie opening ceremony i have ever seen - more than @entity100 , the capital of a communist state ! ' he later insisted he had been ' misunderstood '			0
tonight @entity1 chairman @entity102 said : ' @entity8 has a strong record in his constituency from securing the future of @entity106 , to setting up local job fairs and getting hundreds of people back to work			0
' he has served his constituents with dedication and commitment			0
i wish him the best of luck with whatever he does next			0
' announcing his decision not to stand in 2015 mr @entity8 said : ' it was a wonderful surprise to win the seat of @entity9 in may 2010 with the biggest swing in the country and it has been a huge privilege to represent the people of @entity9 in @entity25 over the past four years			1
' i am grateful to all those who voted for me and supported our campaign which led to our famous victory , winning a seat which had been held by @entity128 for 18 years			0
