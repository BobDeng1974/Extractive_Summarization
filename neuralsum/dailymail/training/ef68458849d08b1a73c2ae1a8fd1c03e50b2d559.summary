@entity1 aims to secure the release by tuesday of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by @entity5 militants , two senior government sources said today , although they declined to say where this handover would take place			1
yesterday , air chief marshal @entity8 , the head of @entity1 ’s armed forces , announced that a ceasefire had been agreed with @entity5 that would allow the girls to be freed			1
the girls were taken during exams from the @entity13 in the remote northeastern town of @entity15 in april causing worldwide shock and revulsion and leading to the twitter # bringbackourgirls campaign			1
there have been a number of times since april when the @entity1 government has announced a ceasefire or even that it had rescued some of the girls , all reports subsequently proved false so the latest claim has been met with some scepticism in the country			1
the ceasefire announcement comes just before a rally in @entity43 where president @entity44 , or his vice president @entity45 , is expected to announce his candidacy for the february 2015 elections			0
fearful : more than 200 girls were seized from the @entity13 in the remote town of @entity15 in @entity51 , northeastern @entity1 , in april , but dozens more managed to escaped @entity1 president @entity44 ( left ) is expected to announce his candidacy in next february 's elections and @entity5 leader @entity56 ( right ) whom the military last year said it had killed one source told @entity59 , the news agency , ‘ i can confirm that [ the federal government ] is working hard to meet its own part of the agreement so that the release of the abductees can be effected either on monday or latest tuesday next week			1
’ however , a second source was more cautious , stressing that there might have to be more discussions in @entity1 and the @entity69 capital @entity70 – the nearest non-nigerian major city to the heart of the @entity5 insurgency – before all the details are ironed out			2
" we have confidence in those we are negotiating with but we are still doing it with considerable caution			0
@entity5 has grown into such an amorphous entity that any splinter group could come up disowning the deal , " he said			2
" [ but ] we believe we are talking to the right people			0
" air chief marshal @entity8 ( centre ) , the head of @entity1 ’s armed forces , announced that a ceasefire had been agreed with @entity5 that would allow the girls to be freed the reason for his confusion is twofold			1
firstly , the group 's sole means of conveying messages are videotaped speeches by a man claiming to be @entity56 , its leader whom the military last year said it had killed			0
secondly , the terrorists are split into several factions that loosely cooperate with each other , and it is unclear with which faction the government has been negotiating			0
it says the talks were held with a formerly unknown militant called @entity107 , who alleges he is the group 's " secretary general "			0
demands : @entity1 take to the streets to protest over their government 's failure to rescue the abducted @entity15 schoolgirls in @entity114 , @entity1 campaigning : first lady @entity115 and @entity117 winner @entity116 supported the twitter # bringbackourgirls campaign @entity5 , whose name translates roughly as " @entity123 education is sinful " , has massacred thousands in a struggle to carve an @entity126 state out of religiously mixed @entity1 , whose southern half is mainly @entity129 or animist in faith			1
@entity1 is @entity132 's most populous country and its oil - rich economy is the continent 's largest			2
at today 's rally in @entity43 , many of president @entity44 's supporters wrapped themselves in the white and green of @entity1 's flag and sang and danced under a banner reading " @entity143			2
our support is 100 percent			0
" two candidates for the main opposition coalition , former military ruler @entity147 and ex-vice president @entity148 , have declared their candidacy against @entity44 .			0

head of @entity1 's armed forces announced truce to allow girls to be freed
more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped in april in remote town of @entity15
