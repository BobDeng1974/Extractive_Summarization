by @entity0 a @entity2 councillor posted a picture showing a line - up of scantily clad women on @entity6 – and compared it to the all - women shortlist used to choose a local @entity9 candidate			1
@entity10 has been forced to apologise for the photograph of eight women in lingerie , which he posted with the caption : ‘ actual photo of the hustings ? ’ the @entity20 councillor and local party chief sent the post , which has since been deleted , to six local politicians including @entity25 mp @entity24			1
offensive ? @entity10 tweeted this photograph of women in underwear to @entity25 mp , @entity24 the @entity20 county councillor apologised after @entity9 candidate @entity29 , 31 , said his tweet was sexist inner circle : miss @entity29 was selected to fight the seat of @entity25 at next year 's general election @entity9 uses all - women shortlists in an attempt to narrow the parliamentary gender gap			1
however , critics say that the policy is patronising to women and discriminatory to men			2
the controversial process was used to select solicitor @entity29 as @entity9 ’s parliamentary candidate for the marginal seat of @entity25 in 2012			1
mother - of - one @entity44 saw the public post on the social networking site and retweeted it to her 4,870 followers			0
she said : ‘ here ’s @entity24 mp & @entity50 discussing my selection to stand as a mp			1
& ppl q why are n’t more women in politics			2
’ she later added : ‘ it is sad and entirely wrong that there appear to be , still , some sections of the @entity2 that have these attitudes towards women and women working in politics			0
‘ it ’s sad that they want to demean women so publicly , and @entity6 is a very public forum			2
‘ comparing the selection of a female mp to an underwear modelling competition is pretty pathetic and really speaks volumes about @entity24 and his colleagues ’ attitudes towards women			1
’ @entity71 , @entity9 ’s spokesman for women , last night joined the fray by writing to @entity74 to ask if he believes ‘ there is any place in politics or public life ’ for mr @entity24 ’s attitude			1
after a storm of criticism online , mr @entity10 was forced to apologise			1
he said on @entity6 : ‘ having reflected on this i think i was wrong to post that photo			2
@entity83 [ all - women shortlisting ] is sexist but glamour pics do n’t help			2
sorry if i upset anyone			0
’ apologetic : later on mr @entity10 realised his mistake and tweeted his followers again to apologise ms @entity29 , a former solicitor , said mr @entity10 had a ' demeaning and rather sad ' attitude towards women yesterday he said his post was ‘ clumsy ’ – but that it had at least been successful in opening up a debate on @entity9 ’s use of all - women shortlists			1
it is still the only party to do so , although the @entity98 have recently toyed with introducing the practice in some cases			0
mr @entity10 , who is the chairman of the @entity101 in @entity103 ’s home town of @entity104 , said of the controversy : ‘ this has given us the opportunity to have a wider debate around all - women shortlists			1
‘ you can dress it up however you like , but if you discriminate against one group of people on the grounds of gender that is discrimination			0
it should not be allowed			0
’ but miss @entity29 said the councillor ’s tweets were ‘ symptomatic ’ of sexism in the conservative party			2
she added : ‘ i appreciate that there is a debate , but pictures of underwear competitions is not the way to have it			0
‘ only one in five @entity2 mps is a woman			0
that is a very small number			0
the fact is that the @entity2 party has a problem with women			0
’ on all - women shortlists , she added : ‘ quite a few people in the @entity9 would prefer not to have them			0
i happen to think they ’re necessary to get more women into politics			0
‘ i think they have been successful when they have been used and half of the @entity9 candidates that are standing in 2015 are women			0
’ she added that mr @entity10 had not apologised personally to her			1
a recent @entity143 poll suggests that @entity9 is ten points ahead of the @entity145 among women voters			0
mr @entity24 , who has a majority of just 1,058 , said his comment was made in reply to another @entity6 user who had picked up on the online debate			1
the @entity2 press office declined to comment , saying it was up to mr @entity10 to justify his comments .			1
