by @entity0 while @entity1 have been taking their final game in @entity3 seriously enough that they would n't allow loyal supporters watch the players train , already - through @entity6 have been taking a very different approach			1
before the tournament this game was seen as one that @entity1 would waltz through to hopefully secure qualification but instead they face the conquerors of @entity13 and @entity14 's and the @entity16 leaders			2
and even the @entity17 seem to be in disbelief - as shown with their mad antics in training that make @entity21 's team look like a joke			0
former @entity47 striker @entity34 got in on the act too - the 37 - year - old who retired seven years ago was taking part in the session and seemed in a pretty jovial mood with the squad knowing they are already guaranteed a place in the knockout stages			1
it is a stark contrast to @entity1 where the camp are spreading the message that they are taking their final game seriously - despite @entity21 making changes to his starting xi including bringing in @entity64 as captain in place of @entity67			2
am i bothered ? @entity69 looks chilled out as the @entity16 surprise package prepare for @entity1 sucker punch : @entity28 flopped with @entity42 but has shown up @entity1 's stars at the @entity73 new role : @entity28 was seen in goal at the @entity40 but could be troubling @entity1 's back for on tuesday top laugh : goalkeeper @entity78 celebrates scoring a goal in training - will he be so lucky against @entity1 ? @entity81 has spoken of ending the campaign of lows on a high - although it is the least that fans who have spent thousands of pounds following the team in @entity3 could expect			1
while @entity1 have been worried about when @entity88 would score his first @entity73 goal , even @entity6 goalkeeper @entity78 managed to score in training on monday			0
it remains to be seen what sort of side @entity6 will put out			0
coach @entity94 will know that a point will guarantee top spot in the group and a favourable draw but equally he may choose to rest players			0
the @entity17 attitude in training seems to completely contrast with that of the @entity103 - and @entity1 fans will be wishing that things could have gone differently to leave @entity88 and co in this sort of mood			0
having a laugh : @entity28 enjoys himself on the floor after claiming the ball from one of his team - mates in training city hero : @entity34 is a coach for the @entity6 squad but even he was messing around in their training session chest pump : @entity78 and @entity120 jump into each other as the @entity17 enjoy training			1

@entity28 goes in goal for part of the session in @entity127
coach and former @entity47 striker @entity34 gets a game
players roll around on the floor in low - key warm up before facing @entity1
