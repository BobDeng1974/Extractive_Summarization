@entity6 , 17 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , was diagnosed with scoliosis - curvature of the spine - and the condition gradually worsened over a 12 - month period until her spine was bent at a 100 - degree angle			1
at her worst point , @entity6 's internal organs were becoming so compressed that she had breathing problems			1
thanks to surgeons at @entity19 , she has made an incredible recovery			2
@entity6 , 17 , has scoliosis which was so severe that her organs were being crushed			1
she is pictured with her mother @entity23 and her uncle @entity24 she underwent two spinal fusion operations at @entity19 during which rods were inserted into her back to straighten her spine now she has been told she can get back to exercising , rock climbing and even bungee jumping			1
her grateful family has raised £ 6,000 for a new scanner for the hospital 's spinal unit to say thank you to the staff for saving @entity6 's life			1
her mother , @entity37 , first noticed something was wrong when @entity6 returned from a @entity40 expedition in which she had to carry a heavy rucksack for days			2
she said : ‘ @entity6 's right shoulder was sticking out and it was n't right			2
i decided to take her to casualty , where she was diagnosed with scoliosis			0
‘ the curve in her spine became so severe that she could n't walk for more than five minutes as she was in too much pain			0
‘ we were told she would have to have surgery , which carried a risk of death , paralysis and blindness			0
’ after two spinal fusion operations at the @entity19 in 2011 - in which @entity6 's spine was opened up , stretched and had rods inserted - she gradually got better			1
