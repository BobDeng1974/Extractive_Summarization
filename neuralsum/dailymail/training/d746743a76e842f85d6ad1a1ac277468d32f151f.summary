the star has such a love affair with the brand that he even splurged £ 551 on a pair of women 's black leather @entity63 jeans			1

or at least stop the circulation to some of your vitals			0
' men ’s skinny jeans are bad enough - some are verging on meggings territory , but women ’s jeans are cut differently : to support a bottom and fit hips , of which @entity3 has neither			2
and what ’s more , i ’m sure no women find it sexy that @entity124 jeans look better on @entity126			0
those twiglet legs do nothing for the opposite sex			0
' surely he can find some decent denim made for men ? i do believe that super skin tight , spray on jeans are slowly dying out ( thank @entity136 ) , so now might be a good time for @entity3 to try a new cut			0
