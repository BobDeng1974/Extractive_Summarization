by @entity1 reporter published : 11:19 est , 16 may 2013 updated : 15:54 est , 16 may 2013 @entity2 went from punk to polished at last night 's @entity5 party , wearing a strapless @entity7 jumpsuit that seems to be a favorite of a-list event - attending celebrities			1
the $ 2,980 jumpsuit , available at @entity13 , was first worn by @entity14 , who was celebrating her 40th birthday , in october last year			2
then a few months later , @entity16 wore the jumpsuit for the season two premiere of girls in january			0
made of silk , the black streamlined one - piece features a large white bow at the back , lending a graphic element to the otherwise minimalistic monochrome design			0
while @entity40 , 20 , teamed her jumpsuit with a bold red lip and @entity44 heels , @entity45 , 27 , also sporting a pixie cut , went for natural make - up and classic black pumps - letting her purple nails make a statement			0
who wore it better ? the jumpsuit was worn by @entity16 ( left ) at the season two premiere of girls in january , and by @entity14 ( right ) in october last year , for her 40th birthday party in @entity57 twice as nice : @entity28 ( left ) and actress @entity29 ( right ) both showed up wearing the jumpsuit to a gala for mrs @entity28 's @entity33 's women 's @entity32 on may 2nd ms @entity14 , 40 , who wore the jumpsuit before it stores , glided down @entity57 's @entity64 in patent @entity65 pumps with a high , slicked back ponytail on her way to the restaurant , @entity61 's , for her birthday on october 5th			1
mrs @entity28 , married to executive vice president of the @entity71 , @entity70 , wore the @entity7 jumpsuit with her blond locks styled in @entity75 waves			1
and miss @entity29 , who is currently executive producing and acting in the independent science - fiction thriller subject 7 , opted for pink lipstick and open - toe black pumps			1
pricey purchase : the $ 2,980 jumpsuit , available at @entity13 , is made of silk ; the streamlined one - piece features a large white bow at the back , lending a graphic element to the otherwise minimalistic monochrome design the jumpsuit , only available in @entity89 6 and 10 , has nearly sold out on @entity13 , despite its hefty price tag			0
@entity7 designers @entity91 and @entity93 , whose luxuriously embellished creations have revitalized the @entity96 fashion house , gravitated towards a more spare aesthetic for their fall 2013 collection			2
and the monochrome palette , also seen on dresses , capes , skirt suits and pant outfits , appears to be a hit with @entity75 .			0

@entity28 and rising star @entity29 also showed up wearing the @entity7 jumpsuit to a @entity57 *benefit* earlier this month
