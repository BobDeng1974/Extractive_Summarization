@entity0 may indeed have been the original author of the play @entity1 after all a play discovered nearly 300 years ago and said to be a @entity0 forgery was really written by the @entity0 himself , new research has revealed			1
the work titled @entity1 was presented by theatre impresario @entity6 in the 18th century as an adaptation of a shakespeare play about a @entity11 nobleman 's ignoble pursuit of two women			1
@entity6 , a known scholar of @entity0 , mounted his play at @entity14 in @entity15 on december 13 , 1727 , claiming that it was a re-working of an original by the @entity0 and that he had three original texts			1
his claims were greeted with widespread scepticism in the eighteenth century , including from the great poet @entity20 , who had considerable clout			1
but a new study of its language to build up a psychological profile of the writer ' strongly identifies ' the legendary playwright as the true author			1
dr @entity29 of the @entity30 said : ' research in psychology has shown some of the core features of who a person is at their deepest level can be revealed based on how they use language			1
' with our new study , we show you can actually take a lot of this information and put it all together at once to understand an author like @entity0 rather deeply			1
' the study applied psychological theory and text analysing software and goes beyond confirming authorship by word counts and linguistic regularities			1
mr @entity29 explained : ' this research shows it is indeed possible to start modelling peoples ' mental worlds in much more complete ways			0
' we do not need a time machine and a survey form to figure out what type of person @entity0 was - we can determine that very accurately just based on how he wrote using methods that are objective and easy to do			2
' results showed the author of @entity1 was likely to be sociable and fairly well educated , findings that do not fit with accounts of @entity6 as rigid and abrasive			1
@entity6 published @entity1 in 1728 and claimed it was based on three original shakespeare manuscripts which have since been lost , presumably destroyed by a library fire			2
yet the authorship of the play has been hotly contested ever since			0
to get to the bottom of the mystery 33 plays by the @entity0 , twelve by @entity6 and nine by @entity0 's collaborator @entity70 , were examined in the study published in @entity72			1
jacobean dramatist @entity70 ( left ) most likely collaborated with @entity0 on @entity1 ( right ) , which was long thought not to have had anything to do with the @entity0 software evaluated ' function words ' including pronouns , articles and prepositions and words belonging to various content categories such as emotions , family , sensory perception and religion			1
they also looked at ' categorical writing ' which tends to be heavy on nouns , articles and prepositions and indicates an analytic or formal way of thinking			0
people who rate high on this are likely to be emotionally distant , applying problem solving approaches to everyday situations while those who rate low tend to live in the moment and are more focused on social matters			0
by aggregating dozens of psychological features of each playwright , the researchers were able to create a psychological signature for each individual and compare them with that of the writer of @entity1			2
every measure but one identified @entity0 as the likely author with @entity6 identified as the best match only when it came to his use of content words			1
but when the texts were analysed across individual acts , they found a more nuanced picture			0
the first three continued to point the finger at @entity0 , but for the fourth and fifth the measures varied between him and @entity70			2
again , @entity6 's influence appeared to be very minor			2
@entity29 said : ' honestly , i was surprised to see such a strong signal for @entity0 showing through in the results			2
' going into the research without any real background knowledge , i had just kind of assumed it was going to be a pretty cut and dry case of a fake shakespeare play , which would have been really interesting in and of itself			0
' tangled relationships , women disguised as men , intrigue laced with tragedy and comedy - some might say @entity1 has all the hallmarks of @entity0			0
set in the province of @entity134 in @entity135 , a love rat called @entity137 courts a beautiful peasant girl , @entity138 , and forces himself upon her when she rejects his advances			0
stricken by a guilty conscience he nevertheless seduces @entity142 , the future wife of his absent best friend @entity143			0
she accepts @entity137 's marriage proposal against her will , because her father @entity146 wants a family connection with nobility			0
@entity142 writes a letter to @entity143 who returns to interrupt the wedding , causing her to faint			0
her father discovers a dagger and suicide note on her person , revealing her determination not to be forced into marriage			0
but for the best part of three centuries the play was dismissed as a falsehood in more than just title			0
that was until 2010 when professor @entity164 , of the @entity165 , put forward his thesis that the play originates from a collaboration between @entity0 and @entity169 dramatist @entity70			2
he claimed the versification was very similar to other works by @entity0 and that @entity1 contained words never seen before and not previously used by @entity6			1
dr @entity29 's new study is the latest to support this revisionist view .			0

double falsehood was presented by @entity6 in the 18th century
theatre impresario made it out to be an adaptation of a play by the @entity0
claims met with scepticism , including from great poet @entity20
but new study of its language identifies playwright as the true author
psychological theory and text analysing software lead to conclusion of @entity30 study which claims to model @entity0 's ' mental world '
