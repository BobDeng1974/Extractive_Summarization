by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 18:10 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 20:53 est , 26 march 2013 only three of the 11 men arrested over suspected sex offences in the aftermath of the @entity8 scandal are likely to be charged , it emerged last night			1
detectives believe there will be insufficient evidence to prosecute the majority of the suspects quizzed under @entity15			1
former @entity17 producer @entity16 , 75 , who was arrested over an alleged sex assault in 1965 , was released without charge on monday evening			1
eleven men have been arrested over suspected sex offences in the aftermath of the @entity8 scandal			2
former @entity17 producer @entity21 , right , was released without charge on monday night and speculation was mounting last night that @entity24 would soon be told that he , too , will not be charged over claims he attempted to grope a 14 - year - old in @entity28 ’s @entity17 changing room in 1974			1
the police operation – which is thought to have cost £ 1million and has 30 dedicated detectives – has already been criticised by some as a ‘ celebrity witch - hunt ’			1
earlier this month , one of @entity35 ’s top prosecution lawyers was accused of hyping up the investigation as if it were a ‘ box office event ’ when he told the public to expect a dramatic new wave of celebrity arrests			2
if , as seems likely , only a handful of men are charged , there are sure to be uncomfortable questions for the police over the handling of the probe			1
yard chiefs insist all arrests by detectives on @entity51 have been ‘ necessary and proportionate ’			2
but mr @entity16 , who spent four months on bail before being cleared , accused officers of being ‘ over-zealous ’			2
he said the police had failed ‘ lamentably ’ to stop @entity8 ’s reign of terror while he was still alive – so were now going ‘ too far the other way ’ in pursuing ‘ spurious ’ claims against others			1
only three of those arrested under @entity15 - the @entity28 inquiry - are likely to be charged ‘ my general comment would be that @entity15 has gone too far , ’ he told @entity62 ’s today programme			1
‘ it is getting silly now			0
’ other celebrities arrested by the @entity67 squad include the comedian @entity68 , pr guru @entity69 and disgraced pop star @entity70 , all of whom deny any wrongdoing			2
another celebrity – a man in his 80s who has not been named publicly – was interviewed under caution over sex allegations in november			0
@entity68 , 59 , was detained over historic sex allegations – not involving children – shortly before he was due to appear on celebrity big brother in january and rearrested last week over new allegations dating back to 1978			0
his second arrest came a week after dj @entity84 , 67 , was rearrested over sex allegations involving adults			0
at his £ 1million home in @entity88 , @entity89 , mr @entity68 said yesterday : ‘ the pendulum has now swung right to the other end ; from doing nothing with @entity8 to this			0
’ he added : ‘ the allegations against me are to do with adults and go back over 35 years , one is from 1978			0
and the only thing i remember from back then is @entity98 ! pr guru @entity69 , left , and comedian @entity68 , right , are among those arrested in the @entity15 @entity70 , left , was also arrested and dj @entity84 , right , was arrested over allegations involving adults ‘ it costs nothing to tell the truth and all i can do is tell the truth			2
it costs to tell lies			0
if an allegation is made , the police have to look into it whatever the cost			2
‘ i just hope they look into my evidence with as much vigour and skill and i trust that they will			2
’ @entity24 , 70 , who was arrested in november , weeks after the @entity117 scandal erupted , has also complained about his treatment			1
he was taken into custody near his home in @entity121 and questioned over claims he tried to grope a woman called @entity124 when she was 14			0
@entity125 , who waived her right to anonymity , claimed @entity24 had had a ‘ very bad attack of wondering hands ’ with her nearly 40 years ago			1
he vehemently denied her claims			0
it prompted @entity24 to seek an injunction to prevent the claims being aired , but his @entity137 application was rejected			1
he initially denied ever meeting his accuser , or appearing with her on @entity8 ’s 1974 @entity17 show @entity139 , but footage later emerged of him and @entity125 in the same shot			1
@entity124 , right , accused @entity24 , left , of a ' very bad attack of wondering hands ' with her 40 years ago @entity24 initially denied ever meeting @entity125 or appearing with her on @entity8 's 1974 show @entity139 but footage later emerged them together in the same shot , pictured the comedian claims he has lost £ 1million in earnings from cancelled shows			1
after police raided his home and seized a computer hard - drive , address books , photographs and his @entity152 , @entity24 said : ‘ it ’s horrible			1
i ’m being made to feel like a criminal			0
‘ i ’ve never ever been in trouble before and i have n’t got a police record			2
‘ it ’s heartbreaking and it ’s affecting my health and everything			0
’ a friend of miss @entity124 told the @entity166 she had not expected @entity24 to be arrested , let alone charged , over the alleged incident			1
the friend said : ‘ @entity124 has always known there was a chance @entity24 would not be charged because it would probably come down to her word against his			1
‘ if she was the only witness , then a prosecution was always less likely to go ahead			0
’ earlier this month , @entity173 , chief crown prosecutor in the @entity174 , said detectives will soon arrest a number of ‘ very high profile ’ figures suspected of child sex abuse			0
he described child - sex abuse investigations as a ‘ growing industry ’			0
critics said mr @entity173 should not hype up any impending arrests like a ‘ box office event ’			0
a number of defence lawyers believe there should now be a new debate over whether those suspected of sex offences , particularly those allegedly involving children , should be named before they are convicted			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

police believe there will be insufficient evidence to charge most of the suspects
former @entity17 producer @entity202 was released without charge
