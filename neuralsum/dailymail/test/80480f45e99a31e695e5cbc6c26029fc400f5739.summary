if a golf course were to be created in @entity2 it might resemble the now serene landscape of @entity4 , where the blood of thousands was spilled a century ago in one of @entity10 ’s most spectacular @entity9 failures			1
an eerie serenity pervades the rolling landscape of this peninsula and , in the bright spring sunshine , there could scarcely be a more peaceful spot for a sunday afternoon stroll			2
but a chill is never far from the spine , whatever the temperature			2
thousands of visitors from the @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 have gathered to honour the fallen at one of the biggest commemorations of the @entity10			2
today this beautiful @entity24 isthmus , facing the @entity44 to the west , the @entity46 and the @entity47 to the east , is a patchwork of monuments and memorial stones linked by country lanes , mountain tracks and undulating greenery			1
@entity9 soldiers land and begin the attack at @entity4 , sometimes known as the @entity4 people have been gathering the graves at @entity59 at @entity4 to mark the campaigns 's centenary @entity9 cemeteries at @entity4 are kept immaculately by the @entity63 a cross left by a visitor at a graveside in @entity4 bearing a personal thanks to the one of the soldiers killed on a visit ahead of the poignant anniversary , we wandered among @entity34 ’s sea - facing white headstones before heading down to the tip of the peninsula			1
here stands one of the most magnificent of the cemeteries , the @entity77 to the @entity36			0
troops are remembered in row upon row of immaculate @entity63 war graves and huge expanses of dazzling white marble , etched with the names of the fallen , which circle the cemetery			2
accompanied by a feral dog and her puppies , we strolled down the dirt track to @entity91 cemetery where the sea laps below the walls and where two @entity95 battalions were laid to rest			0
the mighty ruined fortress of @entity97 , brought to its knees by @entity9 naval firepower in 1915 , overlooks the cemetery			1
the ruins of the fortress at @entity97 in @entity4 - its name in @entity24 means ' barrier to the sea ' @entity107 homes dot the flat sands and yellow sandstone bluffs rise out of the @entity44			1
in the valleys between the cliffs , olive and tamaris trees grow down the steep escarpments			0
we stopped for a stiff coffee at a modest coffee house on the square , opposite the mosque at @entity97 , and watched the fishermen ’s tiny rowing boats bobbing in the slack waters of @entity123			0
a far cry from the fateful morning of april 25 1915 , when one of the bloodiest and most ill - conceived campaigns of the @entity10 kicked off , a campaign which almost brought to an end the career of its main instigator , @entity130 , and which witnessed almost 400,000 casualties			1
the @entity9 plan was as brilliantly simple in conception as it was hopeless in execution : secure the @entity46 and take @entity135 , giving access to the @entity137 to supply the @entity138 in order to free up a new line of attack on the @entity142			1
it would also pull in the @entity144 and @entity145 , ancient enemies of the @entity147 , and hey presto , the stalemate of the @entity149 would be suddenly transformed into a glorious victory from the @entity151			0
@entity130 , who was @entity152 , had underestimated the strength of the @entity24 troops , under the command of modern @entity24 ’s founding father , @entity156 , and had overestimated the potency of his own superannuated fleet , which fell easy prey to the mines and coastal gun batteries			1
@entity130 ( left ) had been a soldier , but in 1916 underestimated the @entity24 forces led by @entity156 ( right ) if the naval thrust was a failure , his attempt to consolidate on land was a calamity , and after nine months of blistering summer heat and frostbitten winter nights the ragbag army of dysentery - ridden men was evacuated the following december and january , and @entity130 was forced to resign his post			1
the easiest way to access the peninsula is from the port of @entity177 , which is a quick ferry ride across the narrowest section of the @entity46			2
the @entity180 ( @entity181 ) , is well hidden from view but well worth finding			0
this 5,600 square metre visitor centre , on the road to @entity184 , was commissioned by the army and the @entity187 and was only recently finished			2
it is an architectural triumph that does justice to its subject			0
the @entity180 has many relics from the campaign from both the @entity193 and @entity24 sides in addition to 11 rooms , with cinema screens shockingly simulating what it was like in the trenches of @entity4			1
there are also some rather more prosaic offerings which carry poignant memento mori : bullets with bullet holes in them as well as @entity156 ’s waistcoat and dress shoes			0
there are also letters , watches , mangled boots and water canteens that would be inadequate for a summer school trip to @entity215 safari park			0
items of clothing worn in battle by @entity156 who commanded the @entity24 forces at @entity4 the battle sites and 31 memorials to the 130,000 dead covers a surprisingly small area			1
this is because @entity9 troops were unable to make much headway against the ferocious onslaught of @entity156 ’s men			1
@entity228 , exhaustion , illness and difficult terrain also dogged every step			0
with an impressive flourish of national pride , the @entity24 government has declared the whole area a @entity237 , to show the futility of war			1
up at @entity241 , where the @entity193 enjoyed a shortlived victory , the trenches have been preserved			0
you can look down on @entity244 below , where @entity36 troops landed , and walk a few hundred metres along the preserved dug - outs in the footsteps of @entity38 ’s @entity247 , before visiting the @entity38 monument			1
here , a statue to @entity156 , the @entity193 ’ nemesis , celebrates the moment when a fob watch covering his heart prevented a bullet from possibly changing the course of modern history			0
from the @entity37 monument at @entity260 there are views across the peninsula , from the @entity44 to the @entity46			2
nearby is @entity263 , the memorial to the @entity24 57th @entity265 , which was wiped out following the @entity9 landings at @entity34			1
@entity156 , the 19th @entity267 commander , famously told his men : " i am not ordering you to attack			0
i am ordering you to die			0
during the time before we die other forces and commanders will take our place			0
" the great man , of course , lived to tell the tale			0
before taking the 10 - minute ferry back across the @entity46 to @entity177 we walked through the @entity279 at @entity280			2
lined by rosemary bushes , baytrees and well - ordered flowerbeds , this is perhaps the biggest and most atmospheric of them all , with 3,236 graves and four ossuaries containing the bones of 12,000 unidentifiable soldiers			1
it surprises many to learn that more @entity279 soldiers were killed at @entity4 than @entity37 and @entity38 combined			1
@entity293 was a guest of the @entity294			0
for more information on @entity24 holiday , visit www.gototurkey.co.uk @entity298 flies form the @entity36 to various @entity24 destinations			1
@entity300 organises trips to the battlefields			0
such a pity that so few @entity279 visit			0
we returned to the @entity300 , near @entity177 , haunted by a hellish vision of the past made all the more poignant by the tranquillity which pervades the present			0
while the 100th anniversary itself is going to be a tad too busy for most , the museum and @entity237 are open to all 365 - days a year			2
for those unable to make the celebrations on the day , there is always a fallback position : @entity317 ’s film about it , @entity319 , is out now			1

25 april is the centenary of the ill - fated @entity4 *invasion* by @entity9 troops
allies sustained heavy loses , mown down by a better - *equipped* @entity24 army
beautiful peninsula is a magnet to relatives of soldiers killed in the battle
the @entity319 , @entity317 's *directorial* debut , is set in its *aftermath*
