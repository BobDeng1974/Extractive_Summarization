yeah , yeah , we all know you 're going to give up smoking , drink less , eat less and save more			2
this year , how about making some @entity4 resolutions that will put a saucy sparkle in both of your eyes ? here are just some ways that you could start your relationship off with a bang this @entity4 ... @entity11 says that the @entity4 is a great opportunity to revamp your sex life i promise to … accept sex ca n't be perfect			1
do n't fall for myths ( or boasts - the neighbours are n't really at it six times a week ) but set real expectations about what you 'd like to achieve and change			2
understand and enjoy the differences between you and your partner rather than try to turn them into ' mini-me '			0
two ' mini-me 's ' makes for super boring bedtimes			0
if you like different things , you 'll encourage each other to try different things			1
sort out any problems in your sexual past so you can have happy sex in the future			1
it 's never too late to get help for a serious sex trauma and it 's definitely time to ditch any silly hang - ups kindly handed over by an insensitive ex. your orgasm face is cute not frightening			1
both sexually and affectionately – and make sure you both know the difference			0
if you 're never sure whether that kiss or cuddle is an expression of love or initiation of sex , you 're going to end up mightily confused			1
there is no such thing as an ideal relationship			1
you let go of the tooth fairy			0
now let go of this			0
@entity11 recommends making an effort to touch your partner more a @entity4 's resolution @entity64 is n't the best policy			1
to be 100 per cent honest , you would have to express every fleeting sexual thought you have about others and every negative thing you think about your partner			0
be tactful , be kind and hold back the really nasty stuff you 're desperate to blurt out in the middle of a an argument			0
accept that most couples fall in and out of love during the course of a relationship			1
it 's normal to have highs and lows and nothing to be frightened of			0
have sex more often even if you 're not particularly in the mood to keep your libido purring and your partner happy			1
it 's been proven time and time again : the more often a couple have sex , the more often they want it			1
as well as trying new things this @entity4 , @entity11 says now is a great time to iron out any problems look the best you can so your partner loves the outside of you as much as they do the inside			1
we all love slobbing in front of the telly but there is a limit to how often you can both pull on the same old moth - eaten t - shirts and track pants			0
even if you 're staying in saturday night to watch a dvd , putting on a nice pair of jeans and top wo n't kill either of you			0
make dates for sex rather than wait for it to happen			1
that way you both have something to look forward to ! if you 're the low sex drive person , it will give you time to get in the mood			1
do whatever it takes - drag out that dog - eared copy of @entity119 or watch a few cat videos on @entity121			0
instigate sex more often to make yourself feel powerful and sexy and let your partner know you enjoy it as much as they do			2
be brave and adventurous and promise not to crinkle your nose up at anything daring your partner suggests but you do n't fancy			2
how do you know you wo n't like sex with a pair of @entity131 on if you do n't try ? talk about and solve sex problems as they happen , rather than let niggly little things turn into big bedroom monsters			1
but choose your battles wisely and focus on all that 's good in your sex life , as well as what needs fixing			1
mix it up every single time			2
change one of the following elements for each session you have : the time of day you do it , what room you do it in , what you 're wearing , what position you choose , who initiates , what the focus of the session is			2
start a ' sex jar ' on @entity152			2
it 's a golden oldie that works a treat			0
each write down 10 things you 'd like to try			2
rip into separate points , fold and put all of them into a jar			0
pick out one a week to try			0
( insist on pre-approval before you pop them in if you think ' lure the hot 18 - year - old next door in for a threesome ' will feature strongly			0
) repeat when it 's empty			0
@entity152 everyone and hope it 's a great one for you all ! visit @entity11 's website for more advice and her books and products .			1
