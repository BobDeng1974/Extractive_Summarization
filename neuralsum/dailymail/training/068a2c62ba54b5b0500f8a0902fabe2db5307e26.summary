an overweight mother - of - two whose crippling post-natal depression left her comfort eating and afraid to leave her own home has turned her life around through hypnosis			1
@entity6 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , was severely depressed after the birth of her second child @entity10 , in december 2012 , and ballooned to more than 14st			1
too embarrassed to venture out , the 34 - year - old comforted herself by gorging on takeaways and sugary snacks - and lived in leggings and jogging bottoms			1
@entity6 listened to the app every night , and continues to use it now			1
the app - ' @entity30 – lose @entity31 ' - was created by clinical hypnotherapists @entity33 and @entity34 and is a hypnosis recording that she would listen to every night and fall asleep to			1
she said : ' the first night i listened to the hypnosis i found it really relaxing and soothing			1
and i noticed a difference straight away when i woke up the next day			0
' i would listen to it every night and fall asleep to the hypnosis – the things it said just seemed to make sense			2
' for example we are all told as we grow up to finish our plates and not leave any food			1
but why are we told that ? if we are full , we do n't need to keep eating			0
' @entity24 has taught me to stop eating when i am full , and i have changed the sizes of my plates and the portion sizes i give myself			0
it has totally changed my attitude and my mind set			0
' the weight came off quite quickly for me , and it only took six months to reach my goal weight			1
' and within about one month of starting the programme i noticed a change in my mental state too			0
' she is now the thinnest she has ever been - and has recovered from the crippling post natal depression that left her reluctant to leave home after giving birth to one - year - old @entity10			1
@entity6 , who also has two - year - old @entity67 with husband @entity68 , said : ' i have tried every stupid diet available - i would lose weight initially but i would just pile it back on again			2
the mother - of - two suffered postnatal depression after the birth of her second child , son @entity10 ' i just stumbled across @entity24 as i was looking for something to help me lose the weight for good on my @entity78 and i typed in ' gastric band '			1
' i noticed it straight away and thought i would give it a try as it was just £ 4.99 , and i would spend that easily on a takeaway or a week at @entity85 anyway			0
' but i noticed a difference straight away , my portion sizes are smaller and now i only eat what i need to eat			2
it just worked - i ca n't explain it			0
' after i had @entity10 i was severely depressed and just ate complete rubbish			1
. i was a shell of my former self			0
@entity6 , left with daughter @entity67 before she lost weight , used to live in baggy clothes , embarrassed about her size but now regularly goes out and socializes , loving her new found confidence ' the post natal depression came on with being told i would never have children , to all of a sudden having two tiny babies to look after			1
' i was too embarrassed to leave the house - it was sink or swim for me and i just sank			1
the more weight i put on the more depressed i got			2
' and if i did go out the anxiety would just be too much , it would spiral out of control			0
' former accountant @entity6 has always battled with her weight - but now , at just 10st , the numbers on the scales are at the lowest they have been since her childhood			1
and , thanks to her new confidence , she also does a @entity117 class twice a week to help keep her weight down and improve her fitness			2
breakfast : nothing snacks : three or four chocolate bars lunch : a large sandwich and crisps snacks : two more chocolate bars dinner : takeaway or pizza with chips and ice - cream breakfast : one slice of toast or cereal snacks : nothing lunch : sandwich ( two slices of bread ) or a jacket potato snacks : fruit dinner : @entity146 or homemade soup @entity6 said : ' the kids were the reason i wanted to lose the weight - i would look at them and think i want to be able to go places and do things with them			2
' i did n't want to be the fat mum picking them up from school that they were embarrassed about			2
' now i am the thinnest i have ever been and i feel amazing			0
everyone comments on the difference too			0
i feel like i am back to my old self			0
' i am much more active and i take the kids out almost every day			0
i have friends that i go out and socialise with now too which i never would have done in the past			0
' my husband thinks it 's great			0
