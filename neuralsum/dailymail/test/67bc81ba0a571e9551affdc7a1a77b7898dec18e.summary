an eight - year - old boy from @entity1 , @entity2 , ran 33 miles just weeks before undergoing his fourth round of surgery on a malignant brain tumor			1
@entity6 just loves to run			2
even before he was first diagnosed with a rare form of brain tumor - known as a mature @entity10 - back in october 2014 , the young man was already running half marathons for charity , even raising $ 1,700 in september for two of his friends who suffer from spinal muscular atrophy			1
though his diagnosis meant more time in the hospital , often in order to undergo some kind of surgical procedure , the tumor did nothing to stop @entity23 from hitting the trails			1
in fact , both he and his doctor say it has actually helped him through his treatments			0
' i got this ! ' eight - year - old @entity31 had already run several half marathons before being diagnosed with a brain tumor , and still continues to run despite his diagnosis most recently , @entity23 made the decision to attempt the 10th annual @entity35 just outside @entity36 , with the help of his running fanatic father			1
the 50 - mile race was the eight - year - old 's biggest challenge yet , but he tackled it like a trained professional , completing a total of 33 miles - longer than a full marathon - before his sore feet forced him to stop			0
' i like running because it helps me a lot with hard times , ' @entity47 told @entity51			0
' it does n’t make me feel scared going into brain surgery			0
' in recovery : @entity23 underwent his fourth brain surgery on wednesday , april 1 , and while the @entity6 family remains optimistic , the fight is not over yet ' i like running because it helps me a lot with hard times ' : @entity23 's hobby has become a source of strength for him in the face of several brain sugeries shortly after his diagnosis last october , @entity23 underwent two initial brain surgeries to help drain spinal fluid and to remove some of the tumor			1
however , due to the risk of stroke , doctor 's were unable to complete the latter			0
@entity23 later went to see doctors for his three month check - up and was given devastating news : the tumor that they originally believed to be benign had grown aggressively			1
a subsequent biopsy lead to a new diagnosis - @entity23 has a non-germinomatous germ - cell tumor , a malignant form of brain tumor			1
luckily for the @entity6 family , the tumor was not untreatable			1
but @entity23 was going to be in for a fight			0
as tough as things became , however , @entity23 never stopped running			0
after every surgery , he would be up and walking within hours , ready to get out on the road once again			0
reaching the peak : @entity23 was running before doctor 's told him of his brain tumor			1
he had even ran a half marathon in aid of spinal muscular atrophy proud papa : @entity23 's father @entity101 is also an avid runner and accompanied his son on the 50 - mile race @entity23 's parents were initially concerned , but their son 's neurosurgeon , who also happens to be a trial runner , set their mind at ease			2
' we asked [ the doctor ] if @entity23 ’s running would affect the growth of the tumor or cause it to do mutations , and he said it does n’t affect it at all , ' @entity23 's father @entity110 told @entity51			2
' he said : " as long as it keeps him happy and healthy , i do n’t see anything wrong with it			0
" ' @entity23 is currently recovering from his fourth surgery and , according to his @entity124 page , already has his next helf marathon scheduled for may 30			2
and though he did n't quite finish his most recent 50 - mile race , the ever - positive little runner plans to take on a 100 - mile race next year .			0
