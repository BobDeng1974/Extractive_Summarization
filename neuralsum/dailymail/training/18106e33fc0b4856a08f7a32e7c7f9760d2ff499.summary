by @entity0 published : 09:03 est , 11 march 2014 updated : 11:39 est , 11 march 2014 in the late 1930s , the jet engine was confined to a collection of sketches produced by a @entity6 engineer			1
his initial designs were ignored , but the blueprints would end up revolutionising the planes are powered and , 80 years on , they still influence the way aircraft is put together			0
now the paperwork which documented the development of the turbojet engine is being sold at auction , and is expected to fetch at least £ 30,000			0
concept : a 1941 drawing of the first prototype jet engine , using the ideas of inventor @entity21			1
it is part of a collection of paperwork which documents the development of the first turbine - powered engine secret sketch : the jet expansion chamber designed by one of @entity32 's engineers			1
the collection of sketches and letters are expected to fetch at least £ 30,000 at auction the paperwork collection of memos and letters were kept by @entity40 , whose engineeering company produced prototypes for inventor @entity21			1
the documents , which were marked as ' secret ' , include specification and memos which led to the completion of the first turbine - powered engine in 1937			1
@entity32 was the senior director and chief engineer of @entity51 @entity50 he kept the material knowing it was of great scientific and historic importance			0
the material is now being sold by auctioneers @entity55 , and is expected to be sold for at least £ 30,000			0
among the documents is the original 1938 contract between the @entity58 , @entity21 's firm @entity60 and @entity50 - @entity50 there are also technical pencil drawings showing the engine as it was developing			1
what resulted from these first engines was the ' jet age ' that would go on to transform air travel			1
first design : the @entity69 was @entity6 's first operational jet , and was used by the @entity71 during @entity72 turbojet : the designs kept by @entity32 led to the production of the first turbine engine , the @entity77 , which powered the first jet planes though @entity21 had submitted his first patent for the jet engine in 1930 it was only eight years later that the @entity58 took an interest following the creation of a prototype			1
in 1939 , the ministry 's director of scientific research , @entity87 , was shown a demonstration of the prototype and was totally convinced of its importance			0
the ministry then placed an order for a flyable version and @entity21 began work on the @entity95 following january the ministry placed an order for a larger more advanced engine , the @entity99			0
linked : the expansion chamber would be connected to the main jet engine 's turbine design top secret : minutes from the meeting where the upgrade from the @entity99 engine , the first turbine - propelled design , to the more advanced @entity108 was discussed with the @entity110 developing their own engine , the race was on , and this archive logs the important stages of the development through the early years of @entity72			1
one letter from @entity87 , the air minister , in january 1940 , records the moment that the ministry decided the project was valuable			0
it was written to @entity32 and states : ' i hope that if you are fully aware of the great importance that the @entity58 attach to the development of this @entity21 engine you will take all steps in your power to ensure that no unnecessary delay occurs in the completion of these engines and that you will do all you can to assist @entity131 in their work			2
' looking to the future : a letter from the @entity58 urging @entity32 to continue the jet - building programme , which was advancing military aircraft at the time the documents also highlight the strain and stresses between the various parties as they tried to complete the project in time to influence the war			2
the jet - powered @entity69 finally entered service with the @entity145 in july 1944			1
@entity146 , head of the books and manuscripts department at @entity55 , said : ' @entity21 had offered his idea to the @entity58 in 1930 , but it was n't until much later that they become interested , after he had joined with @entity32 's company to make them			1
official g - ahead : a telegram from @entity155 belatedly giving permission for @entity32 's engineers to build the prototype jet engines ' these documents were commercially sensitive and because it happened during the war there was an added level of classification			1
' @entity32 saved the documents he deemed important ; the cream of the crop			0
' when we think of aeroplanes in @entity72 we probably think of @entity171 , but not long after the war we entered the jet age because of @entity21 's work			1
the archive will have wide appeal			0
' while @entity21 and @entity50 were developing their jet engine , the @entity110 were also working on their own			2
@entity178 had started work on a prototype in 1935 , and after the war told @entity21 : ' if you had been given the money you would have been six years ahead of us			2
' if @entity186 or @entity187 had heard that there is a man in @entity190 who flies 500mph in a small experimental plane and that it is coming into development , it is likely that @entity72 would not have come into being			0
' innovative : @entity21 applied for the first jet engine patent in 1930			2
he had completed the first prototype by 1937 the ' @entity197 ' saw the development of aircrafts powered by turbine engines , rather than propeller blades or pistons			2
the term was coined in the 1940s , but most of the early jet planes were military designs rather than commercial			0
@entity21 would lead @entity6 into @entity197 , producing the first engine in 1937 , but he was nearly beaten by a @entity110 , who completed his design just five months later			1
@entity21 applied for a patent of his design in 1930 , after rising through the @entity145 ranks from an apprentice mechanic to reporting to the man in charge of the research			2
his ideas were initially shot down , and his patent ran out in 1935 , but some of his colleagues invested in his future ventures			0
competition : @entity21 was up against @entity110 physicist @entity178 in the race to complete the first design @entity21 set up a small company called @entity60 in 1936 , which began work on a prototype engine			1
the same year @entity178 , a young physics and aerodynamics student at @entity110 's @entity230 , applied for a patent for a ' @entity232 for producing airstreams for @entity234			0
' the race to design the first turbojet engine was on			0
@entity21 was on a shoestring budget while @entity178 , whose family were from the @entity240 aristocracy , had a virtually unlimited amount of money			0
but @entity21 made the breakthrough on april 2 , 1937 , after fitting a simple drainage system to his design to stop fuel from pooling in the combustion chamber			2
fighter plane : the @entity249 had a similar design to the @entity69 , but became operational first when it was drafted into the @entity252 in 1944 two years later , despite ignoring his ideas for years , the @entity58 tested his prototype and decided they would use it in military aircraft			1
many would be used during the @entity72 and @entity21 was able to pilot his first jet - propelled plane in 1945 , reaching 606mph			2
@entity178 had started work on a prototype in 1935 , and after the war told @entity21 : ' if you had been given the money you would have been six years ahead of us			0
' if @entity186 or @entity187 had heard that there is a man in @entity190 who flies 500mph in a small experimental plane and that it is coming into development , it is likely that @entity72 would not have come into being			0
' despite creating the first engine , the @entity110 produced the first operational jet - powered fighter plane , the @entity249			1
initially it was beset by engine problems , but it became a part of the @entity252 in 1944			0
@entity21 's 1928 thesis and 1930 patent had led to a true revolution in military and civilian air travel			1
thirty years after fighters and bombers had been hard - pressed to exceed 200 mph , their successors were traveling at 10 times that speed , and long - distance travel times were halved .			0

@entity291 's company manufactured engines in the 1930s
they produced early prototypes for inventor @entity21
documents include ' secret ' drawings , specifications and memos
kick - started the ' @entity197 ' , which would go on to *revoluntionise* air travel
it led to the design of the @entity69 , @entity6 's first operational jet
