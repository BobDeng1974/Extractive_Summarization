by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:22 est , 22 march 2012 updated : 10:41 est , 23 march 2012 @entity2 announced the end of cheap alcohol today as she set out plans for new minimum prices which will add £ 2 to a supermarket 12 - pack of beer or cider			1
the home secretary said as a result of the reforms ' cheap vodka , super-strength cider and special brew lagers will go up in price ' in a bid to tackle anti-social behaviour			1
a minimum price of 40p per unit is likely to be brought in - hitting cut - price supermarket deals			1
a two - litre plastic bottle of cider , containing 15 units , can sell for as little as £ 3			1
but under a minimum pricing scheme of 40p per unit , it could not be sold for less than £ 6			1
supermarket own - brand whisky and vodka bottles containing 28 units can be found for between £ 5 and £ 8			1
but this would rise to £ 11.20 under the minimum price plans			2
12 - can packs of @entity43 and @entity44 are currently priced at £ 9 in the supermarkets , but under the reforms they would rise to £ 11			1
bulk buy promotions will also go - so an offer of two 12 - pack boxes of beer for £ 16 would have to go up to at least £ 22			1
supermarkets will also not be able to offer three - for - two deals on wine			2
@entity55 's over : supermarkets will be banned from offering buy - one - get - one - free deals on alcohol end of cheap booze : @entity2 outlines new minimum prices for alcohol in the @entity62 today @entity2 outlined the government 's plans today in a rare friday statement in the @entity62			1
shadow home secretary @entity66 accused the government of rushing out the proposals to avoid further bad headlines over this week ’s budget			1
she said mrs may was being used as a ' human shield ' in an effort to distract attention from the row over the @entity78 ’s ' granny tax ' raid on pensioners			2
mrs may told @entity80 that by increasing the cheapest drinks in price , anti-social behaviour will be cut			0
' most people have no problem with alcohol , they enjoy a drink - indeed it ’s one of life ’s pleasures , she said			2
' but we all know there is a significant minority in this country who drink dangerously and who cause disproportionate harm			0
' drunken violence had ' made many town centres no - go areas for law - abiding citizens '			1
she told the @entity105 : ' in some shops and supermarkets , drinks are now so heavily discounted it is possible to buy a can of lager for as little as 20p or a two - litre bottle of cider for just £ 1.69			1
' that means many people now drink excessively at home and many " pre-load " before they go out			2
' she said ' pre-loaders ' were estimated to be two - and - a - half times more likely to be involved in violence than other drinkers			0
evidence showed alcohol consumption was closely linked to the price of drink and ' increasing the price of the very cheapest alcohol does most to reduce heavy drinking ' , with young people particularly affected by increases in cost			1
the government argue that a 40p minimum price could mean 50,000 fewer crimes each year and 9,000 fewer alcohol - related deaths over the next decade			2
the death of bargain bulk buy promotions will hit middle class families stocking up on supplies of beer and wine			1
supermarkets will not be able to offer three - for - two deals on wine			2
an offer of two 12 - pack boxes of beer or cider for £ 16 would have to rise to at least £ 22 under the reforms			1
the government are targeting young drinkers who ' pre-load ' on cheap booze before going out			0
by increasing the price of drink bought in bulk , ministers are confident they will cut consumption and change habits			0
however , they will inadvertently hit middle - class occasional drinkers trying to get the best value for money at the checkouts			0
the price of cheap two litre bottles of cider - currently just £ 3 could double under the reforms			1
however , they have not ruled out setting a higher minimum price and are currently consulting on the issue			0
the move will be welcomed by medical experts , but has faced opposition from some @entity80 , who say it will penalise moderate drinkers and cost consumers as much as £ 700million a year			0
ministers have been warned it could also be ruled illegal under @entity183 free trade laws			0
mrs may added that 24 - hour drinking had only made the problem of drink in town and city centres worse			1
she said : ' we were promised under @entity192 's @entity191 2003 a @entity194 - style cafe culture			0
' nothing could be further from the truth in many of our town centres on a friday and saturday night and it 's law - abiding citizens who are actually suffering as a result of that			1
' the government ’s alcohol strategy , designed to reduce the estimated £ 21billion annual cost of irresponsible drinking , will mean a ‘ zero tolerance ’ approach to drunken behaviour in @entity210 departments			2
it also proposes a late - night levy to make pubs and clubs help pay for policing and powers to prevent alcohol being served to drunks			1
time at the bar : @entity221 , pictured enjoying a pint at the cricket last year , will introduce a minimum price on alcohol - likely to be 40p per unit the ‘ zero tolerance ’ approach to alcohol in @entity210 departments will mean hospitals getting the right to instigate a review of licences of particular pubs and clubs if they are getting large numbers of patients they suspect have been drinking there			1
police will be encouraged to put officers in hospitals on saturday nights and other key periods , funded through the late - night levy on pubs and clubs			1
the plan says minimum prices will tackle so - called ‘ pre-loading ’ , when people drink cheap alcohol at home before heading to a pub or nightclub			1
she also suggested that action was possible to restrict deep bulk discounts on alcohol			0
critics of the proposal say it will penalise responsible drinkers , such as middle - class members of ‘ wine clubs ’ who take advantage of discounted deals on fine wines and champagne			2
education secretary @entity271 is thought to have been among cabinet ministers against the move			0
health secretary @entity274 said last night it was not ‘ a magic bullet ’ , but ‘ with the industry , we ’re making strong progress			2
they are announcing a commitment by 2015 to take one billion units of alcohol out of the @entity285 market by reducing alcohol content in some drinks and promoting lower - alcohol products			1
’ ms @entity66 said ministerial appearances on a friday were usually only the result of a national emergency			0
however ' the only emergency ' at the moment was ' the prime minister and the chancellor have gone wobbly over the coverage of their budget ' , she said			0
she said : ' there is no precedent for handling a long - awaited consultation document on a friday morning with no notice in this way			0
' over the last 10 years there have been only three government statements on a friday : on the @entity308 , on swine flu and on @entity307			0
all of them involving serious issues around national emergencies			0
' what is the national emergency today ? the only emergency is that the prime minister and the chancellor have gone wobbly over the coverage of their budget			0
' their budget has gone wrong because pensioners are furious about the granny tax , because middle earners are shocked to discover they will be paying the higher rate and because everyone else is furious to discover they are bringing in a £ 10,000 tax break for the highest earners in the country including , we discover , half the @entity327			0
' this is not about a 40p minimum price , it is about their failings on the 40p tax			0
' the home secretary is being used as a human shield for the chancellor and the prime minister and she should have said no. ' @entity336 , of the @entity337 , said minimum pricing was in effect a ‘ tax on responsible drinkers ’			2
but @entity342 of @entity343 said : ‘ this is a victory for common sense			0
we can not carry on with a situation where it ’s cheaper to buy cans of lager than a can of @entity352			0
’ and @entity353 of the @entity354 added : ‘ we are delighted the government has recognised the importance of minimum price and would urge them to increase the amount to 50p per unit so it has more impact			0
’ there were 1.1million hospital admissions in @entity365 relating to alcohol in 2009/10 .			0

12 - pack of @entity43 or @entity44 will go from £ 9 to £ 11 in the supermarkets
death of the drink offers : two *crates* of beer for £ 16 promotions will go
70cl bottle of vodka for £ 9 will go up to £ 11
2 litre own brand bottles of cider will double in price from £ 3 to £ 6
@entity384 on buy - one - get - one - free alcohol deals to be brought in
