is your libido flagging ? if so , then a lack of sleep may be the reason why , researchers claim			1
a study has found a direct relationship between how much sleep a person gets and their level of desire the next day			1
the amount of shut - eye also affects how aroused they will become			1
the study , involving 171 women , showed that each additional hour of sleep increased the likelihood of sexual activity with a partner by 14 per cent			1
poor sex drive ? getting more sleep is directly linked with an increase in libido , new research has shown @entity27 was also important for genital arousal , according to the research , published in the @entity30			1
specifically , women who slept longer experienced fewer problems with vaginal arousal than those who obtained less sleep			1
' the influence of sleep on sexual desire and arousal has received little attention in the field , ' said dr @entity41 , of the @entity42			1
' but these findings indicate that insufficient sleep can decrease sexual desire and arousal for women			1
he added : ' i think the take - home message should not be that more sleep is better , but that it is important to allow ourselves to obtain the sleep that our mind and body needs			1
' and it 's not just women - previous research found men with poor sleep patterns have significantly lower levels of testosterone , which results in a lack of sex drive			1
experts say that reduced levels of the hormone can bring a host of other negative consequences for young men , including reduced libido and poor reproduction			2
they can fail to build enough strength through muscle mass and bone density , leading to low energy levels , poor concentration and fatigue			0
low testosterone levels are also linked to the metabolic syndrome - a cluster of metabolic risk factors that increase the chances of developing heart disease , stroke , and type 2 diabetes			2
scientists from the @entity88 found men who get less than five hours sleep a night for a week or longer suffer have far less levels of testosterone than those who get a good night 's rest			1
the study showed that each additional hour of sleep increased the likelihood of sexual activity with a partner by 14 per cent - and increased levels of arousal their study found that the levels of the hormone are reduced dramatically to levels more akin to someone 15 years older			1
' low testosterone levels are associated with reduced wellbeing and vigour , which may also occur as a consequence of sleep loss , ' said professor @entity111 , who led the study			2
other reasons for low libido include poor diet , being overweight and low iron levels			0
an estimated one in four @entity118 women does n’t get enough iron from their diet , and iron deficiency is known to leave your libido lagging , says dr @entity124 , a gp in @entity126 with a special interest in sexual health			2
‘ low iron levels are thought to reduce the quality of blood flow and so sap energy , ’ she explains			0
‘ if you ’re exhausted , sex is obviously the last thing you feel like doing			0
’ ‘ the best source of easily absorbable iron is a nice juicy steak , ’ adds dietitian @entity136			0
‘ red meat like steak helps release key amino acids from the brain which are important for good mood			0
’ other reasons for low libido include poor diet , being overweight and low iron levels			0
dietitians say red meat such as steak is a good , easy - absorbed form of iron ‘ red meat is also a good source of b vitamins , which help convert the carbohydrates we eat into energy			2
it ’s also a rich source of zinc , important for the production of the sex hormone testosterone , which women also need for sexual desire			2
other good sources of zinc include beans , nuts and oysters			0
’ eating too much white bread and other refined carbohydrates can sap your sex drive , says @entity136			0
‘ @entity170 such as white bread release the sugar more quickly than their wholegrain counterparts — and too much sugar is associated with energy slumps , which mean you wo n’t have the energy for sex , ’ she adds			0
too much sugar also makes you fat , raising the level of oestrogen in the body , in turn reducing testosterone levels in men , says gynaecologist @entity186 , ‘ if you ’re obese , you feel less attractive			0
you also have reduced blood flow to the sex organs			0

each additional hour of sleep increased the likelihood of sexual activity with a partner by 14 per cent , say @entity42 researchers
the amount of shut - eye also affects how aroused women will become
previous research has found men lacking in sleep have poorer libidos
