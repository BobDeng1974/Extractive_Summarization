for the second straight year , youth and adult membership in the @entity2 has dropped sharply , intensifying pressure on the 102 - year - old youth organization to find ways of reversing the trend			1
according to figures provided to @entity11 , the total of youth members and adult volunteers dropped by 6per cent over the past year — from 2,994,844 to 2,813,997			1
over two years , total membership is down 11.6per cent , and it has fallen 27per cent from a peak of more than 3.8million in 2003			1
while the @entity2 have had an array of recent internal difficulties — including rifts over programming and serious fiscal problems — ceo @entity20 attributed the membership drop primarily to broader societal factors that have affected many youth - serving organizations			1
smart cookies : for the second straight year , youth and adult membership in the @entity2 has dropped ' parents and families are less financially stable , frequently working two jobs or more , leaving little time to volunteer or take their children to extracurricular activities , ' she said			1
in hopes of stemming the decline , the @entity2 are revamping their online platforms with new toolkits			2
one is aimed at streamlining the process of joining the @entity2 ; another seeks to help volunteer troop leaders plan an entire year of meetings and activities with a single online visit			1
' these tools will dramatically decrease the amount of time a volunteer has to spend preparing so that they can spend it serving the girls , ' @entity43 said			2
a crucial challenge , she said , is supporting the current ranks of volunteers and recruiting more adults to join them			2
a breakdown of the 2014 figures shows 809,413 adult leaders and 2,004,584 youth members			0
in 2003 , there were about 2.9million youth members and more than 900,000 adults			0
in some regions , a shortage of volunteers is forcing @entity66 councils to turn away girls who want to join			1
@entity43 said there are about 30,000 girls on waiting lists nationwide			0
' the need for what @entity2 has to offer is not decreasing — more than ever girls need our time and our commitment , ' she said			1
' our challenge is to meet them where they are with enough caring adults to serve them			0
' last year , the @entity2 enlisted first lady @entity82 to make a video pitch for more adult volunteers			1
this year , there 's a national recruitment campaign on @entity87			0
campaign : last year , the @entity2 enlisted first lady @entity82 ( pictured planting seedlings at the @entity90 with @entity2 in 2012 ) to make a video pitch for more adult volunteers just two years ago , the @entity2 celebrated their centennial with a host of upbeat activities , but it 's been a rough stretch since then			1
there was disgruntlement in some regional councils related to a deficit - strapped pension plan , as well as revenue shortfalls that prompted the national headquarters to trim about one - fourth of its staff through buyouts and layoffs			0
many alumnae — including some who were active as volunteers — complained publicly about the closure of some girl scout camps and what they perceived as a misguided shift away from camping and other traditional outdoor activities			0
@entity43 defended the changes , which included new programs seeking to boost girls ' competency with money matters and encouraging them to pursue careers in science and technology			0
the @entity2 also have defended their decision to enter a business partnership with @entity128 , the manufacturer of @entity130 dolls			2
there 's now a @entity130 patch that girls can wear on their uniforms and a @entity136 doll			0
two consumer advocacy groups — the @entity137 and the @entity138 — have urged an end to the partnership , saying @entity130 is a flawed role model for little girls			0
if there 's a broad theme to the @entity2 ' current outreach efforts , it 's to depict its programs as invaluable in helping girls grow up to be leaders , particularly girls disadvantaged by poverty and racial or ethnic disparities			1
the @entity153 recently compiled a comprehensive study , ' @entity155 , ' that assesses how the organization can help address social , economic , and health issues affecting the 26 million girls ages 5 to 17 in the @entity161 that mission — as well as the membership problems and the new outreach strategies — will be discussed next week at the organization 's national convention in @entity167			2
some other youth organizations also have been losing members , for reasons including competition from youth sports leagues and a perception by some families that they are old - fashioned			0
the @entity175 lost 6 percent of its membership last year ; its youth membership has dropped from 3.3 million to about 2.5 million since 2002			2
the @entity175 alienated some conservatives last year by deciding to accept openly gay boys for the first time , while angering gay - rights supporters by maintaining a ban on gays serving as adult leaders by contrast , the @entity2 have long had inclusive membership policies , although there have been some defections by families who felt the organization had become too liberal			1
@entity191 , formed in 1995 as a @entity193 - oriented alternative , now claims more than 35,000 members .			0
