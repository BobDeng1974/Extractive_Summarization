if the freezing water and powerful currents did n't get you then the sharks would			2
but a 62 - year - old grandmother has succeeded where hundreds of the most hardened criminals failed , swimming the treacherous mile - and - a - half from infamous @entity12 to the shores of @entity14			1

@entity15 , who started open water swimming when her son @entity33 took up the sport , said she prefers to stick to ' little swims ' - of up to two miles but she completed the course in an hour and 16 minutes - somewhere behind son @entity33 , who clocked just 31 minutes			1
she said : ' i thought it was a joke at first , i had heard that nobody had ever escaped from @entity12 , partly because of the currents and the cold			2
' i said i was too old for that and would never do it			2
but she booked it up and gave it to me as a @entity57 present , so there was no backing out			2

for 29 years @entity12 prison held some of @entity26 's most dangerous prisoners including mobsters @entity91 and @entity93			1
during that time 36 prisoners tried to escape but only one was proved to have made it to the mainland , where he was found suffering from hypothermia , although some people claim another three convicts listed as ' presumed drowned ' actually made a clean getaway			0
organised swims from the island to the mainland now take place regularly			0
those taking part do not have to contend with one of the hazards that faced convicts going into the water - guards firing at them from the island 's watch towers			1

just like any other evening , prison guards regularly checked on the prisoners on the night of the escape and noticed nothing out of the ordinary			0
but by morning , the three had vanished , leaving pillows and lifelike papier - mache masks with real hair in their beds			1
federal agents , local and state police , coast guard boats and military helicopters scoured the prison complex on @entity24 , then widened the manhunt to the expanse of @entity31 and the surrounding area of @entity177			0
