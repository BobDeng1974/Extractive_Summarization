@entity1 's late mother @entity0 was an @entity2 teacher who spent her life inspiring generations of children with imaginative stories and plays			1
following @entity0 's death from a brain tumour in 2008 , @entity1 channelled her grief into her passion for photography			1
she retreated behind the lens of her camera and created @entity15 , an ethereal fantasy world			0
the photographic series began as a small summer project but grew into an inspirational creative journey			0
' real life became a difficult place to deal with , and i found myself retreating further into an alternative existence through the portal of my camera , ' said the artist			0
@entity1 has dedicated her wonderland photographic series to the memory of her late mother , @entity0 , who lost her life to a brain tumour in 2008 ' this escapism grew into the concept of creating an unexplained storybook without words , dedicated to her [ my mother ] , that would echo the fragments of the fairytales she read to me constantly as a child			2
' @entity1 , 36 , who has a background in fashion and costume design , collaborated with hair and make - up artist @entity42			2
both were in full time jobs so they spent evenings and weekends creating props , wigs , and sets on a shoestring budget and shot in the woodlands surrounding @entity1 's home in @entity52			1
@entity1 developed a deep bond and respect for the locations in which she was working and strove , through her pictures , to ' remind others of their forgotten magic and beauty '			2
she became fascinated with pockets of wild flowers such as the bluebells that would appear for only a few brief weeks of the year			0
in some cases , she would wait a full 12 months so she could shoot costumes matched to the vivid colours of nature			1
' all the characters came to me in my dreams , ' she explained , but she delighted in the chance to step into the scenes for real : ' after all , it 's not often you get to stand beside an eight foot princess in the rain , or witness the dawn with a dancing circus girl on stilts ! ' the resulting images looked so hyper - real that it was assumed that they were created in @entity84			2
many people believed the photographs were shot all around the world , when in reality they were taken in locations within short drives of her @entity52 home			0
so @entity1 began to write diary accounts and blog behind - the - scenes shots about the creation of each photograph			1
' my aim was to portray time passing , an unsaid journey through four seasons , incorporating every colour in the rainbow			0
as things progressed , her costumes became more elaborate with the props and new characters often taking up to five months to create			1
' the project blossomed into our own private playground , ' she said			0
her three year labour of love is now almost complete and there are plans for an exhibition and accompanying book : ' i just know that the day i see my mother â€™s name printed on the inside cover of the @entity15 book , it will feel like i have finally fulfilled my promise to myself and her precious memory			0
