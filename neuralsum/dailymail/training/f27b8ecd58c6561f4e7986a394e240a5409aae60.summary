@entity10 , the president of @entity11 in @entity12 said the prince 's three day visit to the country was ' in extremely bad taste ' just weeks before the 30th anniversary of the start of the @entity19			1
he called on @entity1 living in the city to ' show their anger ' over the islands they call @entity3 by picketing the high profile visit			1

he is currently in the @entity26 state of @entity27 , as part of a @entity29 of the @entity30 and @entity6			0
his first public appearance will be at an event on @entity12 's world - famous @entity38 , billed as an opportunity to showcase all that is great about @entity33			1
mr @entity10 said : ' i consider the arrival of @entity5 , straight after the military exercises in the @entity3 an extremely unfortunate decision and one taken in extremely bad taste			2
' @entity5 can come to @entity6 any time he likes if the motive is to celebrate the @entity48 , raise the profile of his charity or to further business links			2

' i consider it yet another act of provocation by @entity33 , along with deploying prince @entity58 , sending nuclear submarines and its most powerful warship			0
@entity1 would be right to show their anger and bring this to the world 's attention			1
war of words : in january @entity1 branded prince @entity58 a ' conqueror ' after his six - week deployment to the @entity3 , despite serving with an @entity71 squadron rather than an armed unit mr @entity73 , who represents over 60 @entity1 families living in @entity12 , refused to say if a protest was planned			1
but he said : ' let 's just say that there may be groups of people who might cause some confusion in different places along @entity5 's way			2
' he added : ' i would also call on @entity6 ministers to make their own protests if @entity5 brings up the subject of the @entity3			2
it would be a huge error to try try to use the visit to change the position @entity6 has clearly defined in a democratic way			0
tension : president @entity94 and @entity95 have engaged in a diplomatic war of words over the sovereignty of the islands ' if he does try to approach the subject i would hope it would cause a big diplomatic storm across @entity35			2
