by @entity0 a team of 16 talented bakers have completed the great @entity4 bug off - aiming to create a jungle made of cake			1
the dung beetles look worthy of a @entity8 but they are all edible creations made from cake , icing and gelatine			2
even the flowers and branches that they are perched on are edible delicacies created by baker @entity15 , 26 , from @entity16 , and her colleagues			2
the individual bakes come together to form an unbelievably realistic and detailed ( and totally edible ! ) jungle , which will be exhibited at @entity20 2014 this weekend while this cut - in - half bug may not look particularly appetizing , it is in fact crafted out of a variety of delicious sweet materials the group of 16 of the most talented bakers across the @entity4 and the @entity28 have created a jungle made entirely of cake which includes realistic @entity31 which do n't look out of place next to real leaves they have been created after thousands of hours of painstaking work for an event in @entity37 this weekend			1
each dung beetle , no more than four inches long , took days to complete , while some of the more complicated items took even longer			1
they will be part of a display featuring at least a dozen beetles as well as flowers , branches and even a leopard cub , although the leopard has not yet been completed			1
cake maker @entity15 has created terrifying creepy crawlies in the middle of the @entity51 , yet each beetle , flower and bug is made entirely out of cake each dung beetle , no more than four inches long , took days to complete , while some of the more complicated items took even longer for the insects she made a chocolate cake mould with edible blood from condensed milk sugar , food colouring and a raspberry chambord liquor with the wings made out of gelatine			1
she also made 100 flowers made including hibiscus and frangipani as well as creating the leopard cubs by sculpting and moulding sponge cake together with jam and buttercream			1
the jungle scene , called @entity73 , has been created by the group of 16 bakers that call themselves @entity76 and are exhibiting at @entity20 2014 this weekend			1
the @entity78 group was set up by @entity79 of @entity81 cakes			2
the jungle required the intricate crafting of 100 flowers made from hibiscus and frangipani juggling her job as a ceramic designer with her passion , @entity15 has only been entering baking competitions for 12 months , but still managed to create the stunning design one member of the group , @entity15 said : ' i met some of the other girls at the cake shows i attend regularly and we ’ve made friends			1
they needed to replace people in the group to have enough people to take on the workload			0
' they did n’t want just anyone , they wanted people who had talent , and that we are but we all have our strengths so we used that to our advantage			0
' they approached me a few months back so it ’s been hard catching up to everyone but i ’ve made bugs for a photo shoot for the cake and bake promo			2
i ’ve also made leaves , flowers , a tree and two snow leopard cubs			2
close up pictures revealing the amazing detail put in to even the tiny bugs and beetles for the jungle scene ' some of the girls i have n’t even met in person yet so that will be exciting meeting new people			1

disappointed by the plain white cake that arrived which she had ordered , she decided to give put her ceramic skills to good use - and created her own two - part hgv lorry cake			0
@entity142 working on the @entity143 for the jungle scene carefully molding a multi-layered sponge cake into the correct shape she has since competed in some of the @entity148 biggest cake - making competitions such as @entity37 ’s @entity149 where she scooped the gold last year for her brown - and - yellow turtle cake with fondant fins - dedicated to her grandmother , @entity153 , who died last year aged of 91			1
this year in march @entity15 once again took gold for her design of popular advert character baby @entity156 from compare the meerkat advert - a cake which took her 50 hours to make			0
the insects are made from a chocolate cake mould with edible blood from condensed milk sugar , food colouring and a raspberry chambord liquor with the wings made out of gelatine @entity15 has competed in some of the @entity4 's biggest cake - making competitions such as @entity37 's @entity149 where she scooped the gold last year however luck has not always been on @entity15 ’s side as her first competition in @entity172 in 2013 almost ended in disaster when her cake design of a bulldog ’s head fell off at the event			0
her fast - thinking dad caught the head before it smashed on the floor and even with only half a design she took the silver award and has learned a few tricks along the way			0
@entity15 working on the leopard , which will only be completed on sunday , just in time for the competiton a close up of the leopards leg once it has been painted , resting on edible ' mud ' @entity15 said : ' when i loaded the bulldog cake into the car i noticed that it was slightly cracking so i tried to fill it in but it was getting bigger			2
' when i got to the event and the head came right off and my dad managed to catch it in his hand before it landed on the floor			0
i was absolutely devastated and cried for ages , i was so exhausted and now i would have nothing to show for it			0
' i realised where my downfall was as i did n’t use a support for the cake , usually i use dowels , from now on i generally use flat cakes if i ca n’t use anything to support it			0
