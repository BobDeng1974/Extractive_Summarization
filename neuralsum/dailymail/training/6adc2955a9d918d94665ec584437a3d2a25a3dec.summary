by @entity0 published : 03:32 est , 25 september 2012 updated : 07:06 est , 25 september 2012 it was one of the first big brands on the @entity3 - and then it died a quick death when @entity6 came along			1
but now @entity7 is planning a triumphant return , and a sneak peek at the re-design suggests the pioneering social network may well be able to attract old fans and new with a new look that has already attracted admiring glances			1
the site - which has @entity16 among its investors - is apparently vanquishing the old glitzy appearance , which was never helped by giving users control over their own colour - schemes , and brining in a sleek , minimalist experience which seems influenced by @entity23 's tile - based approach seen in the latest version of @entity25			1
a demonstration video showed off how the new interface both deeply integrates into @entity6 and @entity43 while offering its own spin on communicating online			1
@entity7 's was one of the darlings of the internet in the early 2000s , but faltered fo0llowing a $ 580m purchase by @entity49 in 2005			2
@entity49 sold @entity7 this june for $ 35million - just six per cent of its original purchase price			1
he played @entity54 entrepreneur and @entity6 investor @entity55 in the 2010 cinema hit @entity58 apparently the musician - turned - actor took the role home with him , as he was a key player in the $ 35million @entity7 purchase from @entity49 last @entity63 was announced as the leader of the business strategy during the take - over , and his profile is used within the @entity7 demo video.at the time of the purchase , he said : ' there 's a need for a place where fans can go to interact with their favorite entertainers , listen to music , watch videos , share and discover cool stuff and just connect			1
@entity7 has the potential to be that place			0
' @entity81 is inspired by people and vice versa , so there 's a natural social component to entertainment			0
i 'm excited to help revitalise @entity7 by using its social media platform to bring artists and fans together in one community			2
' in another interview he said : ' they were n't successful in treating and evolving the product enough , it was basically this junkheap of bad design that persisted for many many years			2
' there was a period of time where if they had just copied @entity6 rapidly , they would have been @entity6			1
they were giant , the network effects , the scale effects were enormous			0
' as @entity6 's popularity soared , @entity7 tried to re-launch itself as a music - centric online community , but never managed to reclaim its lost glory , and was stigmatised as a site where people 's profiles descended into a clash of colours and poor layout			1
but @entity7 promised to change yesterday			0
in a statement , the company said : ' we 're hard at work building the new @entity7 , entirely from scratch			2
' but we 're staying true to our roots in one important way - empowering people to express themselves however they want			2
' so whether you 're a musician , photographer , filmmaker , designer or just a dedicated fan , we 'd love for you to be a part of our brand new community			0
' visitors could leave email addresses to be sent invitations to the redesigned @entity7 service			0
the layout appears to eschew older websites design in favour of a @entity138 appearance @entity7 wants to attract bands back into the fold , offering lots of details about fanbases and top fans the new photo library uses large images to navigate between albums earlier this year , @entity7 launched a new music player that it said attracted a flood of new fans			1
@entity7 is vying with hot @entity3 music services such as @entity152 , @entity153 , and @entity154 as people increasingly go online for entertainment content			0
@entity7 claims the largest library of online music with about 42 million tracks			0
@entity161 's chief executive @entity160 told shareholders last year that the 2005 acquisition of @entity7 was a ' huge mistake ' and the social network was mismanaged ' in every possible way '			0
see video here : the new @entity7 from @entity7 on @entity168 .			0

relaunch ' coming soon ' as company seeks to *regain* popularity it had in the late *1990s*
minimalist photo - based design could win fans back from @entity6 and @entity178
