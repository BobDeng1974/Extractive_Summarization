then i realised it was and suddenly shouted to @entity13 , “ he ’s in , he has gone ”			1
’ miss @entity10 , who wept throughout the hearing , said she immediately jumped into the water , which was much deeper than she had thought			1
‘ i was shouting , “ my boy , he ’s gone ”			0
i expected to touch the sand as soon as i was in , but the water was so deep i was being dragged straight out			2
i scooped my arms to find @entity5 but he was not there			1
it felt like i was in a whirlpool , i was being dragged everywhere			0
the current was so strong i could n’t get back to the jetty , i was just caught in a whirlpool			2
the next thing i knew , a red ring [ lifebelt ] was being thrown around me			0

in a separate statement , he said : ‘ i saw @entity10 jump in			1
i can remember her shouting , “ where ’s @entity5 gone ? ”			1
i could n’t see @entity5 but i put my arms out in front of me to try and grab him			1

‘ i had been dragged by the tide and was now about ten metres away from the jetty			0
‘ i was trying to swim against the current but i could n’t			0
all my energy had gone , i was just exhausted			0
i remember saying , “ i ’m gone ”			0

’ the inquest heard that the tide often washes over part of the concrete jetty at @entity58 , @entity24 , ( pictured ) , which is about 492ft ( 150m ) long and nearly 20ft ( 6m ) wide family at the scene , shortly after @entity5 was swept away			1
the distressed couple had to be pulled from the sea and taken to safety as the @entity79 began a search for the little boy witness @entity82 , said that moments before @entity5 fell , he heard miss @entity10 telling him to keep to the left and away from the water ’s edge			1
‘ you could see the little boy was jumping			0
but when he jumped the once , he went straight down the side and he never came up , ’ he said			0
@entity5 ’s body was washed ashore four days later			1
miss @entity10 and mr @entity5 , from @entity92 , @entity93 , had been visiting @entity5 ’s grandparents in @entity58 last august with his sisters , @entity96 , three , and @entity97 , 11 months , and cousin @entity98 , two			1
they decided to go for a seaside walk at around 6pm and wandered along the jetty to the water ’s edge , where children were playing			0
flowers and tributes left at the scene			0
mr @entity5 , who said he was a poor swimmer , said he was barely able to take breath as he battled the surging water in the hope of finding his son candles spell out the name of @entity5 amongst the mass of flowers left by friends , family and passers by exactly a week after he fell into the sea more than 400 people joined @entity5 's parents at @entity120 in @entity58 to remember him during a memorial service , while a minute 's silence was also held for people to pay their respects near to where the little boy was last seen alive but @entity5 , who was wearing a blue t - shirt and blue shorts , is thought to have lost his footing , causing him to plunge into the sea			1
the inquest , at @entity23 , @entity24 , heard how the tides at @entity58 are some of the highest and most powerful in the world			2
it was estimated that the speed of the current on the day of the tragedy was around four or five knots , approximately 5mph			0
that would have been enough easily to sweep an adult off their feet			0
despite a search involving both the @entity145 and the local @entity146 , it was not until four days later , on august 23 , that @entity5 ’s body was discovered at @entity148			1
a married couple who were visiting the club found the missing boy , who looked as if he was ‘ just sleeping ’			2
@entity153 @entity152 , who attended the scene to recover the body , said it was ‘ as if the sea had just given the boy back and placed him on the sand ’			2
recording a verdict of accidental death by drowning , @entity24 coroner @entity160 said the tragic events could not have been predicted or avoided			2
describing @entity5 as a ‘ lovable and lively young boy ’ , he told the hearing : ‘ this is something that could happen to any parent and there was nothing @entity5 ’s parents could have done to prevent this accident			1
‘ @entity5 wanted to go down towards the sea and he was jumping about and i think just mistook his foothold			2
neither he nor his parents realised how vicious the sea can be			0
the tide was rising and tragically it was a spring tide which is the highest			0
’ @entity5 would not have had a chance once he fell , mr @entity160 said			2
‘ we can not restrain children			0
they have a life to live			0
sadly , this was a tragic way to end it			0
