when you think of @entity2 , what are your standout memories ? i have three			1
the first is of him as a fresh - faced and fearless 18 - year - old , lighting up @entity8 ; second is his magnificent season in 2009 - 10 when he fired 34 goals for @entity12 and was named @entity13			1
@entity14 comes the 2010 @entity16 qualifying campaign when he scored nine times under @entity19			1
others will have their own highlights but it is doubtful anyone will place wednesday ’s game against @entity25 at the top of their list			0
though he marked his first match as captain with an emphatically dispatched penalty , nobody was in a hurry to shout about his display			0
for the vast majority , it is the spell when they produce form of higher quality and greater consistency than ever			0
making his debut in the @entity81 at 16 confirmed him as exceptional but it also meant there was potential for him to peak early			0
having made 615 appearances for club and country , he has stats that you would expect of a player in his mid- 30s			1
cars are not valued by their licence plate but on how many miles they have done			0
competing at the highest level for the past 12 years , with all the pressure and intensity that accompanies it , leaves a mark			0
can you imagine , from the age of 18 , having to carry the burden of being the man for club and country ? playing at the highest level is mentally and physically draining and the pressure on players like @entity2 takes a toll			1
what is happening to @entity2 is not unprecedented			2
look through the history books and you will see that those forwards who burst on to the scene as teenagers were rarely able to sustain that impact and consistency for entire careers			0
defenders tend to have longer careers because it is possible for them to plod through games but with forwards , it is all about being explosive			2
@entity123 movements , swift changes of gear , constantly operating on the edge , while taking a battering in the process			0
when he was 19 , he was @entity130 ’s best player and for three seasons , between 1994 and 1997 , his goal record was exceptional but when he reached 26 , he was no longer first choice at @entity134			2
@entity135 burst on to the scene			2
like @entity2 , he was seen as the saviour for his club and country at the age of 18			1
@entity135 was sensational between 1998 and 2002 , winning the @entity141 , but physically and mentally it was a big burden to carry			2
by the time of @entity8 , there were calls for @entity135 to be replaced by @entity2			1
@entity135 moved to @entity146 that summer but he would admit his best form was before he was 25			2
neither @entity135 nor @entity129 were helped by injuries - were they triggered by starting out so young ? skipper : @entity2 has been given both the @entity12 and @entity42 captaincy but is no longer as explosive games : @entity2 has played 615 matches in his career at the age of 28 , as many as players in their mid- 30s young starters : @entity135 ( left ) and @entity129 ( right ) broke into the first team at @entity130 as teens best years behind him : @entity135 left @entity130 for @entity146 and then @entity161 but was not as potent maybe that needs to be considered with @entity163			1
he is in the position @entity2 and @entity135 were in - the rising young star of @entity167 football - but it ’s important he is protected and not flogged by club and country in the next few years			1
this problem is not confined to @entity167 players			0
take @entity173 , for example			2
a 16 - year - old sensation at @entity146 , sir @entity176 once called him ‘ the best in the world ’			0
he scored 134 goals in a five - season spell , between 1998 and 2002 , when @entity146 won three @entity181 cups			1
over the next eight years , he scored 131 but in his final few seasons at the @entity183 , he was a shadow of the player he had been			2
did that stem from being overplayed and subjected to great mental pressure from so early on ? even the absolute best , the @entity189 ronaldo and @entity188 , found their influence fading by their late 20s ( both played top - flight football as teenagers ) and there has been talk that we may not see again the @entity199 who mesmerised for @entity201 ’s @entity200			1
there is no doubt that last season , and his performances at the @entity16 , showed there is less dynamism in his game , comments which have also been made about @entity2			1
oustanding : @entity163 , at 19 years old , has been a stand - out performer for @entity42 this summer environment : @entity47 is worried that @entity163 may shine as youngster but , like @entity2 , wane as he ages peaked too soon ? @entity173 's goalscoring ratio deteriorated quite rapidly as his career at @entity146 progressed @entity216 : strikers @entity188 ( left ) and @entity218 ( right ) became less potent as they reached their late - 20s distant memories ? @entity199 starred under @entity201 but he has struggled a bit in the past year do n’t mistake this for a criticism of @entity2			1
he has been a great player for @entity12 and has the honours to prove it			0
he has been very good for @entity42 , too , and is likely to break both the scoring and caps records held respectively by sir @entity229 and @entity230			0
but at the moment , questions are being asked of him , such as , ‘ does he deserve his place in the team ? ’ @entity2 might not be at his best but in his last three @entity42 games he has scored twice and provided an assist			1
the time to ask whether he should still be picked is when he no longer contributes			0
i would have played him in @entity240 on monday night even before @entity241 was injured			0
@entity242 , who had been suggested as an alternative to @entity2 , has only eight goals in 27 games for @entity42			1
@entity2 has 41 - 31 of which have been in competitive games			1
he might not be playing well but he still believes he will score whenever he does feature			0
he will still influence this @entity42 team , it just might not be as spectacularly as 10 years ago			0
blow : @entity241 picked up a knock during @entity42 training at @entity253 @entity254 can upset the odds and catch @entity256 cold i had the privilege of watching @entity256 ’s last competitive game from the stands and on sunday i will be in the @entity263 studios when they begin qualifying for @entity265			1
it does n’t seem two months since @entity256 became world champions in the @entity268 but that heady night against @entity269 prompted a changing of the guard and it will be interesting to see how @entity254 fare in @entity273			1
@entity274 and his squad should be relishing this opportunity to take on @entity256 in @entity273 ’s magnificent @entity277			2
nobody will be giving @entity254 a hope of getting a result but maybe this is as good a time as any to face @entity256			1
time to shine : @entity47 believes @entity254 can upset the odds and surprise world champions @entity256 prize guys : ( from left ) @entity286 , @entity287 and @entity288 won the @entity16 earlier this summer since they beat @entity269 , @entity289 - their captain and best full back - has retired , as have their record - breaking striker @entity291 and the @entity293 defender per mertesacker			1
maybe @entity256 will not be as strong as they were in @entity189 ? true , the midweek 4 - 2 defeat by @entity269 might prompt a reaction from @entity298 ’s squad but @entity254 have nothing to lose and everything to gain			1
perhaps this could be the initial step that leads the @entity303 to a major tournament for the first time since 1998			1
once @entity256 get into their stride , they will win @entity309 but @entity254 will be optimistic of finishing in front of the @entity311 and @entity312 to take second place and secure a trip for the @entity315 to @entity316 in two years ’ time			1
time to go : @entity319 @entity16 winners @entity291 ( left ) and @entity289 ( right ) have retired what i 'm looking forward to this week ... heading to my local ground to watch some authentic football			2
with the @entity81 taking a break because of international fixtures , i ’m taking the opportunity to go to the @entity327 with my son , @entity328 , to watch @entity327 v @entity329 in the @entity330			0
given that it is a @entity130 - @entity333 rivalry , i ’ve no doubt that it will be fiercely competitive and , with luck , there should be a decent crowd , too			0
if you ’re like me , the last thing you will want to do on a saturday afternoon is head to the shops ! local football : @entity47 hopes longer international intervals will get more fans attending non-league football the international break has got me thinking , though			2
the way the @entity265 qualifying fixtures are now spaced out means that @entity349 clubs are going to have an opportunity to attract spectators who would n’t usually go to their games			2
saturday is the annual @entity353			0
if communities made a conscious effort to go and give their local teams their backing , it would make a difference in safeguarding their futures			0
teams like @entity327 are proud of their history and heritage			0
recently , @entity364 , another well - known @entity366 club , had to fold			0
if we all support @entity353 , maybe in the future other clubs around the country will not suffer a similar fate			0

@entity2 has played 615 matches during his club career at age of 28
players are usually in their *mid-early* 30s before they play as many games
he was brilliant at @entity8 , scored 34 goals in the 2009 - 10 season and he netted nine times for @entity19 in 2010 @entity16 qualifying
but @entity2 was quiet on wednesday and he is becoming less explosive
from age of 28 - 31 it is usually the prime of a player 's career but @entity2 may have has his already because he started playing at such a young age
@entity135 , @entity129 and @entity173 also waned as they got older
we may have even seen the best of @entity199 by age of 26 as well
@entity254 can upset the odds and catch @entity256 cold on sunday
@entity303 may even qualify for first tournament since @entity16 1998
non-league sides may see rise in attendances during international weeks
