six months ago @entity0 was a city in panic as the @entity3 were desperately fleeing @entity5 forces as they bared down on the border town , fearful that they would be slaughtered like the @entity7 before them if the settlement was overrun by the fanatical jihadis			1
now the terrorists have gone , beaten back into the desert by @entity3 forces and coalition airstrikes , and the residents can return to their ' saved ' city			0
but , as these images show , not a lot of the home they remember is still standing			2
tanks rust in the streets , buildings reduced to mere shells after bombings serve as temporary shelter for those who survived , while a little girl is reduced to lighting a fire underneath a piece of rubble in the street to keep warm			0
a sign which once proudly displayed the town 's name now stands riddled with bullet holes , like the few buildings left standing around it			0
the battle for @entity0 was the fiercest and most bloody battle of the war against @entity5 to date , and represented the group 's first major defeat after months of virtually unopposed victories which saw them take swathes of territory in @entity44 and @entity45			1
at one point things looked so bad that @entity48 president @entity47 declared the city was only hours away from completely falling into @entity5 ' bloodstained hands			0
@entity51 was secured at the end of january after the last @entity5 fighters were forced from the city 's suburbs and into their strongholds along the @entity57			1
civilians forced to flee across the border into @entity48 are now returning home			0
the residents who survived or have returned are now faced with living in conditions like this pride : a @entity45 @entity3 woman sweeps rubble out of what is left of her home after @entity5 fighters fled the city of @entity0			1
the fighting here lasted for four months , and has left the city in ruins making the most of it : just six months ago this @entity3 boy , along with thousands of other @entity3 , were desperately fleeing @entity0 , fearful they would be slaughtered if the city was overrun			2
now they can return , but little of their previous home remains desperate : with little or no access to water and electricity , this young girl is forced to light a fire underneath rubble in the street to keep warm and cook her food shattered : a @entity0 sign riddled with bullets and shrapnel marks mirrors the condition of the few building that are left standing around it homecoming : after four months of fierce fighting the @entity3 , who were facing near extinction at the hands of @entity5 , are able to return to what is left of their home town and begin rebuilding it flattened : a girl rides in a trailer being towed into @entity0 by tractor as rows of levelled houses can be seen in the background			1
the city was heavily bombed by coalition warplanes during six months of fighting in order to dislodge @entity5 troops taking cover there all gone : a @entity3 man looks out over the destroyed city of @entity0 from the balcony of his bullet - riddled home , just over a month after the last @entity5 fighters fled for their strongholds along the @entity57 littered : a woman stands among the ruins of her old home , as the streets around her are scattered with rubble , clothes , and ruined cars destroyed : the remains of another tank are testament to the ferocity of the fighting in @entity0			1
against all the odds , @entity3 forces which were at one point pinned in the centre of the city , managed to fight their way out and claim victory nothing left : a man holding a rolled up cigarette and clutching a glass of drink stands among the ruins of his house			0
at one point the situation here was so dire the @entity48 prime minister warned the city was hours from falling into @entity5 hands all he has left : a @entity3 man walks back into his home after six months spent hiding from @entity5 across the border in @entity48			2
on his back he carries everything he owns wrapped into a rug back to business : a baker goes back to work amid the shattered remain of @entity0 as residents go about trying to rebuild their previous lives what remains : a @entity3 boy walks down the stairwell of his home in @entity0 , littered with rubble and a keyboard			2
@entity5 fighters have previously been videoed destroying the instruments for being ' un-islamic '			0

in *september* last year the city of @entity0 *emptied* as residents fled for their lives ahead of a huge @entity5 *offensive*
four months of fighting saw fierce *gun* battles rage along the city 's streets while warplanes bombed it from the air
residents are returning after @entity5 troops fled in january , but as these images show , little of their home remains
