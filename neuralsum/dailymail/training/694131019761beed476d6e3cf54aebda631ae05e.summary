by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 these pictures show the moment the organiser of a hairdressing awards apparently headbutted a guest after the event descended into chaos			1
the images , taken at the @entity11 at a luxury thistle hotel in @entity13 , appear to show @entity14 strike the guest 's face with her forehead - moments after another guest had exposed her rear			1
but mrs @entity14 , 57 , strenuously denies the assault , which came after she also appeared march down a catwalk set up on the stage towards the audience and seemingly hit someone with her handbag			1
' they said i head - butted somebody but i would n't			0
' i was swaying , because i was being held from behind and i was pushed into her			0
' it was never a head - butt			0
the woman is a good friend of my daughter , why on earth would i try and do that to her ? ' the awards ceremony , which had billed itself as a ' showcase ' for the beauty industry , and included guests such as actress @entity59 and miss @entity61 @entity60 , began to unravel when presenter @entity62 announced the wrong name for an award			1
@entity14 said : ' it was never a head - butt			1
the woman is a good friend of my daughter , why on earth would i try and do that to her ? ' peacemaker ? the woman in red appears to be trying to calm down the event organiser mrs @entity14 said : ' we had nimrod from @entity74 and he picked up the award cards from earlier that had been left on the podium rather than taking the card that came with the award			1
' he called out the wrong name , and on the projector screen was the @entity83 and instead he called out @entity84 , who had already received their award earlier			2
' not willing to allow the award to be given unjustly , ms @entity14 said she took to the stage to point out the mistake and make amends			1
' i should n't have done it , i do n't know why i did it but i just felt it was unfair as the right person had n't been called out , ' she said			0
ms @entity14 said the unfortunate incident scuffle was down to a presenter calling out the wrong winner glammed up : 26 - year - old ms @entity100 ( pictured left and right ) exposed her rear at ms @entity14 during the event ' so i went on stage and said " i 'm really really sorry , there 's been a mistake , could @entity84 go off as you have not won , the rightful winners are @entity83 "			1
' there was a bit of booing , as the audience by that point were a bit rankled , to say the least , but the girl from @entity116 came up and took the award so it was fine			2
' however , female guest @entity100 , 26 , then ran up on stage , swore and exposed her rear			1
farce : guests at the event said that ms @entity14 had been drunk , and that the ceremony had descended into farce ms @entity14 said : ' i went on stage again to say that we had n't completed the raffle but the mics went dead , and just at that moment a girl from @entity130 came up on stage and put her fingers in my face			1
' then she did a moonie directed at me and i said " well that 's very lady like " , to which she ran back and tried to attack me			0
' i tried to signal to the team to put the mics back on so i could complete the raffle , but people in the audience thought that i was going after the girl			2
' they all came on stage and tried to hold me , they were all my friends , they misinterpreted the situation			0
' ms @entity14 said the crowd then became rowdy			1
in the video clip ms @entity14 is seen being restrained by a security guard			1
she said : ' i started to resist as they were all pulling and shoving at me , and the next thing i know i 'm being carried by security guards outside			0
' to this moment i still have n't got any idea why that happened , and it must have looked so bad to everybody			0
' she denied she had been drunk , and explained she was not wearing shoes because she had broken her toes			0
' i was running about in my bare feet all night because i 'd broken my toes while moving boxes at home , and i could n't get my shoes on , ' she said			0

i did n't have the time to get drunk			0
