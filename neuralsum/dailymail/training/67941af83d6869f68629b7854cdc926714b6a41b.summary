a letter which was written by a @entity2 graduate and handed down to first - year students as a frank survival guide for 25 years has been unearthed			1
the candid six - page confessional was written at some point during the late 80s by @entity7 - now a @entity9 - based author and ceo - and offers @entity12 students the sort of sage advice that is applicable to many walks of life			1
' you do n’t need to be in a study group , you do n’t need to turn in every homework , you do n’t have to appear bubbly and social all the time , ' the letter states			2
' you do n’t have to interview with investment banks and consultants , you do n’t need to be conservative and safe in class discussions			2
' gone public : the candid six - page letter ( pictured ) was written during the late 80s by @entity7 - now a @entity9 - based author and ceo - as a source of advice to new students at the @entity2 mr @entity7 , who grew up in a turbulent , emotionally abusive home in @entity30 and was highly intimidated when he first joined the esteemed @entity2 , penned the letter to reassure and encourage his fellow students			1
' this note reflects my personal thoughts , feelings and suggestions for a more fulfilling @entity2 life , ' he wrote			1
@entity39 of the list was mr @entity7 's suggestion to embrace moderation when it came to studying			1
' i could never understand why some people would spend hours on putting the finishing touches on a report , when the act involved very little additional learning			0
decades later : mr @entity7 ( pictured today ) was highly intimidated when he first joined the esteemed @entity2 in @entity9 ' @entity48 perfectionism at its worst , ' he wrote , adding that the sooner this habit is broken ' the happier you 'll be			1
' he also advised that rather than ' carefully reading an article , ' students would do better to ' skim - read ' three of them , and socialize a little with the time saved pouring over books			0
' you often only need to know about half the material covered , ' he revealed			0
' if you work hard because ... you are afraid of not passing , because an ugly monster in your nightmares keeps reminding you that the world will come to an end if you do n't pass , you can easily resent the experience and find it painful			0
' the illuminating letter also placed a strong emphasis on getting to know classmates , avoiding the harsh judgement of others , and generally being a pleasant human being ; which mr @entity7 points out is far more likely to lead to later success than getting the best grades			1
' by actively judging people positively , you are exposing yourself to being hurt a little by a jerk , ' he conceded			0
' but that is a small price to pay to get to know many more wonderful people that you would n't otherwise take the chance on			0
' we really are a bunch of very nice people here , only most of us are afraid to show it openly			0
' elite : the letter unwittingly became something of a manifesto , and is allegedly still in circulation among new students at @entity2 ( pictured ) and other schools around the country following the letter , mr @entity7 has since claimed he received an unexpected flood of thank - you responses from students who were helped or comforted by his words			1
it thus unwittingly became something of a manifesto , and is allegedly still in circulation among new students at @entity2 , and other schools around the country			2
four years after he first wrote the letter , mr @entity7 followed it up with an epilogue , stating : ' i am deeply moved that this letter has become a traditional gift from the second year class to the first years in the weekend before midterms			1
' written in 1991 , it included lessons he had further learned since leaving @entity2 - ' a very unusual place , with extremely high standards ' - and joined the real business world			1
' you often only need to know about half the material covered ' ' no one has once asked me about my grades since graduation , ' he wrote			0
' the more lasting impact of the @entity2 for me ... has been the soft rather than hard skills of management and the resulting relationships			2
' mr @entity7 , who published a motivational book called @entity124 in 2012 , concluded his wisdom - packed manuscript with one last kernel of advice			2
' not one on his / her deathbed has been known to say " i wish i had calculated a few more @entity131 [ @entity132 ]			0
" ' some have been known to wish they had taken a few more chances , loved a few more people , touched a few more lives , fought for a few more causes , caused a few more smiles			0
