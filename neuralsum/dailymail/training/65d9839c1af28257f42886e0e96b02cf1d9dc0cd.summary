@entity2 - who turned up to the event at the @entity31 hotel wearing a waistcoat emblazoned with his daughter 's picture on the back - said the family had found it extremely hard to sell her house , where she died			1

we 're planning all sorts of things in @entity5 for @entity16 's birthday - there will be lots of events			1
' there will also be a statue unveiled at the @entity128 – subject to planning permission			1
the sculptor , @entity130 , is commissioned , so fingers crossed			0
’ the evening was made all the more emotional as @entity30 was honoured at the gala with the @entity134 's @entity133			1

and she said : “ @entity41 , i ca n’t believe that @entity30 knows my name , and that he knows who i am			0
” and when she was asked to do the duet with @entity30 , she was so excited			0
i asked her what she was going to sing , and she said : “ i ’ve chosen @entity147 , because it ’s your favourite ”			0
i said : “ do you know the words love ? ” she said : “ @entity41 , you ’ve been singing it to me for 25 years – of course i know the words			0
" brushing away tears , @entity2 added : ' ‘ you ’ve only got to watch the video of them performing together to see the wonderful relationship they had in such a short space of time			1
' after @entity16 passed away , i did n’t know how i was going to survive			0
the thing that saved me the most was that on that sunday afternoon , @entity30 called me and spent an hour on the phone with me			0
i could n’t believe that someone like @entity30 would do that for someone like me – and it just showed how much he loved and appreciated @entity16			0
’ @entity181 hot : @entity85 showed off her curves in a figure - hugging white dress as she attended the first annual @entity9 at the @entity31 in @entity32 on thursday oscar winner @entity85 was also honoured at the event and looked stunning as she took the stage to perform @entity186 and @entity187			2

@entity2 revealed the @entity134 will start helping youngsters in the @entity199 - joking about a telegram of support from @entity32 mayor @entity202 , jibing : ' thank you to mayor @entity202 for that wonderful dedication			1
it would have been better if you had sent $ 10 million or something , but thank you			0
’ he added : ‘ @entity2 created the @entity134 long before it was called the @entity134			1
' she was the one who took a homeless young person into her home ; she was the one who made me fly to @entity211 with a suitcase full of money to pay for a stranger to have an operation on his hernia – someone she ’d just met			2
she was the one who sold all of her dresses and gave the money to charity			0
' she started this long before we did – she was a very charitable and loving young lady			0
' sexy extras : the @entity148 - winning singer wore hot red lipstick and had her brunette hair styled in sleek curls remembering a legend : @entity85 performed on stage at the @entity2 event @entity30 also paid tribute to the star , saying she lived a complete life because she was able to achieve her goal : becoming a respected musician			1
' her dream was to become famous and a beautiful singer and she accomplished that , ' he said			2

' @entity86 , 37 , produced @entity16 's hit record back to @entity36 , and said : ' we recorded all the stuff we did on @entity36 to @entity36 here in @entity32			2
all the stuff with the band was in @entity265 and then the vocals were done at a studio downtown that is n’t there any more			0
' i first met @entity16 in @entity32 – this is where we started our friendship , so it ’s very relevant to have this event here tonight			0
' it is quite ambitious to spread the @entity134 ’s work across the @entity199 , including the @entity276 , but it makes sense – so much of what @entity16 loved came from @entity199 jazz and soul music in @entity199			2
