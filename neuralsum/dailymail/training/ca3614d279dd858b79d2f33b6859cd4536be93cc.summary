@entity1 ’s crash was so shocking that it ’s almost difficult to put into words			1
i was informed of the severity of his accident by the @entity7 immediately after the @entity9 @entity8 ; that it was extremely serious and as such the race result became completely irrelevant			1
you would have seen that @entity12 , @entity13 and i did not spray any champagne on the podium			0
it was n’t a time to celebrate			2
since the race , i have spent a lot of time thinking about @entity1 , his family and the people who are close to him			1
@entity13 , @entity12 and i did not spray champagne during a very sombre podium at the @entity9 @entity8 i will be wearing a sticker showing support for @entity1 on my crash helmet ( right ) during this weekend 's race he has a lot of friends in the paddock – obviously being a @entity34 many of them are from @entity34 – so i have been spending some time with them , particularly @entity35			1
i flew from @entity9 to @entity36 with the @entity38 driver and i am staying in the same hotel with him			1
we have spent that time exchanging our different stories of @entity1			1
i am really hoping that there is some good news on his condition , but tragically it has to be said that it is looking very serious			0
as such , the mood in the paddock ahead of this weekend ’s race is very different			1
nobody is laughing or having a good time			2
everyone is talking and thinking about @entity52			1
because i speak @entity34 , i have had several chats with @entity1 since he made his debut at the start of last season			2
in the picture below you will see me sharing a joke with him ahead of this year 's @entity60 @entity8			1
i ca n’t say i know him that well , but what i can say is that he is highly regarded in the @entity64 paddock and certainly considered to be one of the upcoming drivers of the sport			2
@entity68 speaking to @entity1 ahead of this year 's @entity60 gp			1
the @entity34 is highly regarded in the @entity64 paddock everyone is thinking about @entity1 ' horrible accident in the build - up to the inaugural @entity36 @entity8 we will be wearing stickers on our crash helmets for this weekend ’s inaugural @entity36 @entity8 to show to the world that we are all still with him			1
the stickers translate to : ‘ everyone with @entity52 ’			2
of course his accident at @entity79 will be a big topic for the drivers when we meet on friday evening with the @entity7 , like we do every race weekend , to discuss the safety of the sport and what we can do moving forward			2
all the drivers will be there and the focus of the meeting will be how , as a sport , we can learn from this			0
on a personal note , did i think it was too dark or too wet in @entity9 for the race to continue ? to be honest , i do n’t wish to comment on any of that because it is not my position to say whether it was right or wrong			2
this is a time for compassion and our thoughts now must be with @entity1 , his family , and how the sport can move forward from this			1
@entity1 's name is still above the @entity108 garage ahead of this weekend 's race in @entity36 lacking confidence last time out in @entity9 i really struggled on the intermediate tyres , which was a complete contrast to the handling of the car whilst i was leading on the extreme wets			1
our car balance was completely wrong from where it should , and usually would , have been , and that is why we were really troubled as a team			0
i struggled much more than my team - mate @entity121 because the balance was so far off and i had so much oversteer , which meant the rear of the car was stepping out all the time			0
it was really difficult for me , and probably for the first time this year , it was a race where i really lacked confidence in the car			2
that is my conclusion and explanation for our lack of pace which was unfortunate really			0
@entity135 admitted he lacked confidence in the car despite leading the early phase of the @entity9 race @entity139 were caught off guard which made if difficult for @entity135 during the @entity9 @entity8 when it rains so heavily as it did in @entity79 , you go into the race in completely different conditions than you have ever driven before so you are heading into the unknown			1
you have got what you ’ve got and you can not develop your setup as you would do in dry conditions over the course of a weekend			0
that made it difficult for me to drive during the race and that is also the reason why @entity154 were quicker than us on the intermediate tyres because we got the balance wrong			2
there was some suggestion we could have adopted a wet setup in qualifying , as @entity154 did , but the oversteer we encountered in the race was impossible to foresee			0
it is easy to say in hindsight we should have adapted before the race because we knew the rain was coming , but it is not that easy , and the balance problem caught us off guard			0
despite now being 10 points adrift of @entity12 , i still regard myself as being in a good position in the fight for the championship , now that i am the chaser , instead of the one being chased			0
@entity36 makes its @entity64 bow looking ahead , we are here in @entity36 for the first time in the history of @entity64			1
i have been here all week and it is certainly an interesting country			0
i ’ve driven the @entity182 circuit in the simulator and if i was to compare it to a track we have been to before it would probably be @entity187 as they have their similarities			0
it looks as though it will be a good circuit and it is always a challenge , as a driver , to adapt			0
the @entity36 @entity8 is making its debut on the @entity64 calendar this weekend the @entity182 circuit will evolve over the course of the weekend			1
the best laps will improve by four seconds the track has never been used before so the asphalt will get quicker and quicker as the race weekend progresses			0
indeed we ’re expecting the circuit to evolve by something like four seconds a lap between the first runs on friday and our quickest laps in qualifying on saturday , which is huge , a different world ! double trouble @entity212 could win the constructors ’ championship this weekend and that was obviously one of our main targets of the year			0
it is great to be where we are and have the possibility to do that would be an amazing feat for our team			0
after @entity36 we have some time off so i will spend some of it with my family and some with the team to prepare for the final three races of the season in @entity230 , @entity231 and then the finale in @entity233			1
of course , the title could be decided on the new double points ruling which is completely artificial and strange to have such importance for one race , but i guess now that i am behind , it is a good thing			0
when you are in front it is not so good ! @entity68 is 10 points adrift of @entity121 , winner of the @entity9 @entity8 , with four races remaining @entity243 remains critical but stable @entity135 's fee for his column will be donated to the @entity246 , which is dedicated to providing help to former and current @entity64 mechanics and their families , putting @entity64 mechanics throughout the world in touch with each other and raising funds to help in times of need			1
you can follow @entity135 on @entity258 @ nico_rosberg and @entity139 @ @entity259			0

it 's difficult to put into words @entity1 ' awful crash at the @entity9 @entity8
i have spent a lot of time thinking about him and his family since the race
the mood in the paddock ahead of inaugural race in @entity36 is very serious
we *'ll* be wearing stickers on our crash helmets to show our support for him
this is a time for compassion and our thoughts must be with @entity52 ' family
