by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:34 est , 2 august 2013 updated : 06:38 est , 2 august 2013 more than 270 government staff are employed on zero - hours contracts , despite @entity5 warning they cause ‘ worrying levels of insecurity ’ for workers			1
five ministries admitted having employees working in departments and agencies on contracts that give them no guarantee of a regular income			0
it leaves the coalition at risks of being accused of encouraging the use of the controversial deals , which are also in use at @entity23 , the @entity24 and several big name high street chains			2
uncertainty : more than 270 staff in @entity28 and quangos are on contracts which do not guarantee any work according to latest figures released in @entity34 , there are 278 people employed by departments and quangos on zero - hours contracts			1
it includes 172 at the @entity40 , five at the @entity41 and two at the @entity43			0
the @entity44 admitted that its agencies have 48 people on the contracts and the @entity48 said its quangos employed 51 without guaranteeing them any work			2
the revelation is embarrassing for mr @entity5 , who this week warned families needed to know what hours they will be working in order to plan their bill payments			1
criticism : deputy pm @entity5 said he was concerned that the use of zero - hours deals meant families could not plan their income the deputy pm said the government was reviewing the use of zero - hours contracts and a decision on whether to limit them could be made this autumn			1
he said : ‘ i am a huge advocate of flexibility in the @entity70 labour market , it ’s one of the reasons we have not suffered the spikes in adult unemployment that we have seen in other countries			0
‘ but there has to be a balance			0
there can be a really worrying level of insecurity if you are employed on zero - hours contracts			2
‘ people with families have got to pay bills			2
we have all got to plan about what income we have and what we have got to pay out			2
’ he said @entity92 ’s business department was reviewing the use of the contracts this summer ‘ to see if we need to make any adjustments ’ to employment law			0
this week it emerged @entity23 had around 350 part - time workers on zero - hours contracts			1
they were drafted in to cover the opening of the @entity104 's @entity103 home this summer but denied usual rights like holiday and are not certain of a single hour 's employment			2
zero - hours contracts do not set a minimum number of hours that have to be worked , with staff on call all the time , not knowing whether they will have work from one week or month to the next			1
unlike the self - employed who can work for who the like , workers on zero - hours contracts must ask for permission from their bosses if they want to earn cash elsewhere			1
and although workers are able to turn down work , many fear that doing so means they will not be asked again in the future			1
popular : people queue every year to enter @entity23 for its annual @entity128 , but it emerged this week that temporary staff are on controversial zero - hours contracts temporary staff working in the @entity23 shop , meeting and greeting visitors and monitoring some of the @entity23 's grandest rooms are on deals like this to keep down costs			1
royal officials have denied these are zero - hours contracts because they rota staff a month in advance , not at the last minute			0
it has previously emerged that employees at other national institutions – including 3,700 staff at the @entity24 – are also on the deals , meaning that workers at many of @entity70 ’s grandest stately homes are not guaranteed a single hour ’s paid employment			1
it has also been alleged that cinema giant @entity153 's part - time workers and catering staff at the @entity156 galleries in @entity103 , @entity157 and in @entity158 , @entity159 , are similarly treated			0
some 20,000 staff at @entity161 , which is controlled by billionaire founder @entity162 , are also on the same contracts			0
uncertainty : some 90 per cent of workers at 396 stores are now on zero - hour contracts with the company more than 90 per cent of the company ’s @entity70 shop workers are on part - time contracts that do not guarantee them a single hour ’s paid employment			1
employment lawyers warn the contracts make it difficult to manage family and childcare commitments , and present problems when budgeting to pay household bills or getting a mortgage			0
yesterday the @entity180 revealed 250,000 were employed on zero - hours contracts last year , 50,000 more than previously thought			0
a recent report by the @entity183 into zero - hour contracts concluded : ‘ the benefits these contracts provide for employers come at too high a price for the majority of those employed on them			0
’ on its website , the @entity192 says : ‘ the problem with zero [ hour ] contracts is that you are only paid for the time you work , so even if you have to wait on work premises or be at home waiting by the phone , you may not be paid for this waiting time			0

around 278 temps do not get guaranteed hours or holiday pay
if they turned down work , they can fear they will not be asked again
there are calls for the deals to be *banned* because they *favour* employer
@entity5 warned of ' *unacceptable* uncertainty ' for workers
