by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 ’s pursuit of top summer target @entity4 is being complicated by the fact the @entity8 central defender would prefer a move to neighbours @entity10			1
city are keen to bring @entity4 to the club to partner captain @entity13 as they defend their @entity15 title next season and are hoping to negotiate with @entity17 over a ¤ 45million buy - out clause			2
@entity11 , however , are facing a fight to convince the 23 - year - old that he should join them rather than hold out for an offer from @entity23 that may not come			0
@entity33 manager @entity34 does have a fancy for @entity4 after losing @entity36 to @entity37 but he is not a top target for new @entity10 boss @entity39 as he looks to replace @entity40 and @entity41			2
@entity42 is instead considering a move for @entity45 defender @entity44 of @entity46			0
@entity4 is so highly rated that one @entity15 manager recently told journalists that he was the ‘ most complete central defender in @entity49 ’			0
looking elsewhere : @entity10 boss @entity39 could turn to @entity46 's @entity44 instead @entity51 : the @entity8 is currently part of @entity55 ' @entity54 squad			1

@entity17 's @entity4 is on @entity3 's summer shopping list
but the @entity51 *international* would prefer a move to @entity10
@entity10 boss @entity39 could turn to @entity44 instead
city are keen to find a long - term *defensive* partner for @entity13
