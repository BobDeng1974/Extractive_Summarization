it is no exaggeration to say @entity2 has two weeks to save his @entity4 career			1
two more poor performances , at the @entity6 in @entity7 this week and the @entity8 that follows , will surely bring to an end a proud record of continuous service dating back to his debut in 1997			2
@entity2 missing out would be a huge loss for @entity15			1
as captain @entity16 has acknowledged , he was the unsung hero of the team ’s successes over that period			2
others may have holed the winning putt or garnered more points but the @entity23 was the imposing backdrop			0
even when not at his best , at @entity26 last time , it was entirely typical he still contributed a point when it was most needed , against @entity29 in the singles			2
why not pick him on past record then , as assistant captain @entity32 has urged ? because sentiment has no place at the @entity4 and experience is a vicious double - edged sword			1
missing the cut ? @entity2 is in danger of not being selected for the @entity4 for first time since his debut going through a bad spell : @entity2 has missed four halfway cuts in a row look at what happened to poor @entity45 last time			1
@entity45 and @entity2 are both in their early forties and have enjoyed similarly successful careers			1
in 2012 , @entity45 was going through a period where he could n’t win to save his life — still is , alas , as his latest final - round collapse , at the @entity52 on sunday , demonstrated — but was picked by captain @entity53 as an act of faith			0
when push came to shove , @entity45 could n’t deliver			0
recent meltdowns trumped experience as he lost his crucial singles to @entity60 despite being one up with two to play			0
who would want to see something horrible like that happen to @entity2 , of all people ? over the next fortnight , therefore , he has to earn the right to a wild card			1
we all know when playing well he ’d walk into the team			0
@entity71 , even at 70 per cent , i ’d pick him			0
but the facts are @entity2 has n’t even played four rounds in an event since may having missed four halfway cuts in a row , let alone contend , and is well off the pace for one of the nine automatic spots			1
no room for sentiment : @entity45 ( @entity82 ) was selected by the @entity83 for the @entity84 with disastrous results pecking order : @entity87 ( @entity82 ) and @entity88 are better placed for wildcards than @entity2 with the much better placed @entity88 and @entity87 guaranteed wild cards if necessary , it means he is competing for the final pick against the likes of @entity94 , the man currently 10th and who has finished 18 - 4 - 15 in his last three starts			1
or @entity96 , who is coming into form , or @entity98			0
at least @entity2 is assured of 72 holes this week , since there is no cut at @entity102 — and he has shown once before that class is permanent			1
in 2012 , he completed an amazing comeback from 243rd in the world all the way to no 1			1
how he could do with proving the old adage once more over the next fortnight			0
@entity109 ! @entity87 was forced to visit hospital after a horse fly bite anyone who follows @entity87 ’s entertaining @entity114 feed must have reached the point on sunday where they just went : what now ? the @entity23 was on his way to hospital , the latest in a series of medical misadventures this season that have contributed to his disappointing year			1
hopefully , this latest ailment , a nasty horsefly bite that caused his arm to swell , wo n’t cause yet more disruption			0
he ’s another player who could do with a big fortnight			0
@entity15 ’s @entity4 captain @entity16 gently took me to task a few months ago when i made light of him mentioning @entity132 as a candidate for a playing spot at @entity135			1
how could you pick a 57 - year - old given the strength of the regular @entity139 , was the gist of my argument			0
yet watching the @entity143 ’s incredible 13 - shot victory in the @entity144 at @entity145 last week , you could envisage an enticing scenario			0
still got it ! @entity132 scored a 13 shot victory at the @entity144 at @entity145 two foursomes matches alongside compatriot @entity150 , while who would want to take him on in a singles match ? i still do n’t think it will happen			2
but @entity16 is entirely right to give it due consideration			0
‘ i do n’t care what @entity157 does between now and the @entity4			2
if @entity157 wants to play , i would certainly choose him			0
’ @entity159 makes his views clear on the great @entity162 debate — and demonstrates why he was a poor @entity4 captain			1
new lease of life : @entity165 won @entity166 shortly after splitting with @entity167 couple of birdies : @entity165 has been linked with @entity169 ( @entity82 ) and @entity170 ( r ) splitting up with fiancee @entity167 in may , winning @entity166 in july and being photographed with two striking women either side of the tournament was enough for at least one columnist to conclude @entity165 is the new @entity162 in every sense			1
as lazy slurs go , this one would be hard to beat for indolence			0
@entity165 is 25 and has pronounced himself ‘ very happy and very single ’			2
when @entity162 was philandering his way across @entity83 , he was married with two kids and continually spouting about the joys of being a family man			2
not difficult to spot the difference , is it ?			2

@entity2 could miss out on @entity4 for first time since his debut
former world no 1 *golfer* has missed the halfway cut in his last four events
@entity87 was forced to visit hospital after being bitten by a horse fly
@entity132 could still be a contender for a spot at @entity135
@entity165 can not be compared to @entity162 in the love stakes
