by @entity0 published : 14:29 est , 14 june 2013 updated : 14:35 est , 14 june 2013 there was a time when the prospect of @entity4 crossing the @entity5 at speed might have been a source of some alarm			1
but today rail passengers on both sides of the water will be celebrating @entity4 ’s @entity12 receiving permission to run its 200mph trains at ‘ blitz ’ or lightning speed through the @entity17			1
it will get travellers from @entity20 to @entity21 in four and a half hours – and vice versa			1
a @entity4 @entity25 high speed train coming out of the @entity17 on its test run in 2010 experts predict the extra trains and competition from the nation most renowned for making its railways run on time will result in cheaper fares and a better deal for passengers			1
it will add four million passengers to the 10 million who already use the rail - link ‘ @entity17 ’			0
the decision follows three years of negotiation and a trial run of a 200mph @entity4 bullet train in october 2010			2
it will lead to direct services between @entity4 and @entity48 and @entity21 with connections across the country			1
the aim is to run regular services between @entity21 's @entity53 and @entity54 in @entity4 , as well as @entity55 in @entity48			1
experts say the competition could also mean lower fares with a one way trip to @entity4 costing as little as £ 39 to £ 49			1
the decision was welcomed by transport secretary @entity61 who is in favour of the move			0
the @entity64 , one of @entity4 's most modern superfast trains , which will be continuing to expand across the continent announcing the new deal , @entity68 said : ‘ after three years of detailed study , the @entity70 has granted @entity12 an operating certificate to run passenger services through the @entity17			1
’ it said : ’ we believe that this long awaited decision will considerably enhance exchanges between the @entity78 and northern @entity79 ( @entity4 , @entity48 ) and will over time add between 3 and 4 million new passengers per year to the 10 million already using the existing high speed passenger services			1
’ a @entity68 spokesman said : ‘ this new chapter requires no additional investment as adjustments to the timetable and modifications to the paths through the @entity17 will suffice to accommodate the new traffic			0
’ he said : ‘ this increase in the choice of services offered by railway operators is a measure of the improvement in the transport sector as it brings major benefits to passengers			0
@entity99 , chairman and chief executive officer of @entity101 said : ‘ twenty years after the start of commercial services , the authorities have finally opened the @entity17 to all			0
‘ this is wonderful news for the millions of passengers in northern @entity79 who can now use this most environmentally friendly means of transport to travel to @entity21 ’			2
the @entity4 first made their pitch for a cross-channel train in october 2010 when they sent a trial 200 - mph @entity4 bullet - train on a slow - speed dry run trial for a new direct cross-channel link			2
the @entity4 ' @entity118 ' train bearing the initial letters ' @entity25 ' adorned as a red , white and blue @entity120 , aims to replace passenger jets as the main transport to @entity4 's financial capital and the @entity124			2
the plan is for three services a day in each direction - each carrying 888 passengers in 16 coaches - on a new generation @entity4 cross-channel bullet train that will put the people of @entity135 closer in travelling time to the @entity78 capital than they are to their own capital , @entity20			1
two high - speed trains - one @entity4 , left , one @entity140 - in @entity139			2
the @entity142 high speed train and @entity25 @entity118 was a significant collaboration between rival rail giants , @entity140 's @entity144 and @entity12 in @entity146 , the trains will split , with eight carriages carrying 444 passengers heading to @entity149 and then @entity55			1
the other eight carriages will head to @entity135 and then @entity54			0
@entity12 officials said the journey time from @entity135 to @entity21 would be under four hours - less than the time it takes to get to @entity20 , around four and a half hours : ' passenger can choose which capital they prefer - yours or ours , ' said one db official			1
it also mean business travellers and tourists can relax for longer in their seats or work via wi - fi rather than enduring the hassle of airline check - in , security and trips to and from the airport			0
it is the latest step in the plan to create high speed rail links across @entity78 and @entity79 - from @entity175 to @entity176 and @entity177 to @entity178			0
but while trains will hit 200mph on the @entity182 , tunnels on the @entity78 side of the @entity5 mean high speed trains are restricted in many places to 140mph			0
the @entity4 challenger was the first all - new train to use the @entity17 since it opened			2
@entity4 railway giant @entity12 has already been busy buying up a number of @entity78 train operators and has now set its sight on taking on the airlines and arch rival @entity191 to win passenger services between the @entity78 and the @entity182			1
it aims to slash the train travelling time from @entity21 to @entity54 , nicknamed ' @entity194 ' in @entity4 because it is the nation 's major financial centre , from around six hours to less than five hours			1
this competes with the door - to - door four and a half hours needed to fly there , once travel to the airport , check - in time and the 1 hour 30 minute flight time are put together			1
launching the plan at @entity53 in october 2010 , @entity12 boss dr @entity203 said it marked ' a new era ' of train travel adding : ' @entity79 is becoming a small place			1
' every day there are around 50 flights between the @entity211 area and the region of @entity54 and the @entity124			0
' the @entity213 is a joint venture combining @entity12 and @entity191 trains to @entity139 for a service to the @entity216 as part of @entity12 's expansion across the continent until now that was out of reach of the railways , he said : ' but times change			1
thanks to new railway lines , new high speed trains , and new transport policies , we will be able to share in that market			2
' mr @entity203 said : ' three pairs of trains will connect @entity54 and @entity21 via @entity135 , @entity146 , and @entity233 , with one train running in each direction in the morning , at lunchtime , and in the evening			2
' this will also be the first time that @entity55 and @entity149 have a direct connection with @entity21			0
' the high speed @entity4 - built @entity118 ( @entity25 ) trains have to pass stringent safety tests to pass through the @entity17 - including evacuations			2
their arrival nevertheless highlights how far international relations have moved			0
some 73 years ago , at the height of the @entity247 , the narrow strip of water comprising the @entity5 was all that separated @entity78 from @entity4 invasion			0
today the nation which was defeated is now running much of @entity78 's railways			0
last year state - owned @entity12 said it would delay the launch of direct train services between @entity21 and @entity54 to at least 2016 , compared with initial plans to start the route in 2013			1
cross-channel train services are currently operated by @entity191 , which is majority - owned by @entity140 state - owned @entity144			0
@entity68 gets a fee for each train passing through the tunnel linking @entity264 to @entity265			0
the announcement comes as ministers are embroiled in a ‘ jobs for @entity78 workers ’ row after confirming that @entity4 ’s @entity271 had won a controversial £ 1.6bn contract to build trains for the @entity275 line			1
the decision is a huge blow to @entity279 - based @entity278 , one of three major employers in the city and the last @entity78 - based train - maker			0
@entity284 - owned @entity278 had warned ministers it needed the @entity275 contract to safeguard the future of the factory – which survived a zeppelin airship raid in 1916			0
it announced 1,400 job cuts at @entity279 plant when it was first announced that it had lost the deal			0
@entity294 general secretary @entity293 said : ‘ this will be a death blow to @entity279 ’s economy ’ .			0

@entity20 to @entity21 rail service will take only four and a half hours
a one way trip to @entity4 could cost as little as £ 39 to £ 49
@entity4 railway giant @entity12 has set its sights on rival @entity191
trains will be connecting @entity21 's @entity53 with @entity4 and @entity48
