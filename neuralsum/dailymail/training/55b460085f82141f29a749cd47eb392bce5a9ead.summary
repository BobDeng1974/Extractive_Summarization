@entity0 has been a photographer since age 11 - a remarkable fact considering his craft is considered sinful in the remote @entity5 colony where he grew up in @entity6 , @entity7			1
' i think it ’s based off the bible verse " thou shalt make no graven image			0
" but i personally think they 've taken it out of context			0
' mr @entity0 told @entity16			2
' i was always told it ’s sinful			0
and it ’s frowned upon as well			0
' mr @entity0 was forced to leave his family and his people two years ago at age 19 to pursue his love of photography , but before he left he captures some of the first intimate images inside a conservative @entity26 sect that is closed off from the outside world			1
his pictures of the @entity30 are a loving depiction of life in a small community that is struggling to embrace new technology while sticking to the traditional religious principles of leading a simple , communal life			2
they believe in living a simple , peaceful communal life - but are adopting some modern technology , as well @entity0 's images offer an intimacy of daily life in a @entity5 commune that has never been seen before - because he was one of them @entity0 says his @entity5 commune was the best place to grow up			1
' it 's a carefree childhood - running in the woods , swimming in rivers			0
it 's irreplaceable , ' he told @entity16 the @entity5 , like other @entity72 like the @entity74 and @entity75 , form tight - knit communities that are largely based on farming			1
unlike they @entity74 , many @entity5 embrace technology - if only in a limited capacity			1
every home is wired with the internet - but mostly to allow children to connect with @entity5 schoolteachers in other communes hundreds of miles away			2
cameras are allowed , but only to document progress on work or building construction			0
mr @entity0 is entirely self - taught			2
he fell in love with the craft when he picked up a point - and - shoot camera that his father , the school principal in his community of 110 people , had taken home			0
' being the only @entity5 photographer at the time , no one else in the colony knew anything about photography , ' he said			1
and the community was anything but encouraging			0
@entity0 started taking pictures and age 11 and is entirely self - taught			1
there were not even books about photography in his school library cameras are allowed - but only to document work progress like new construction			0
taking pictures of people is frowned upon - and even considered sinful @entity0 said he mainly only had problems with members of the older generation of his community			1
younger @entity5 did n't object to his photography nearly as much @entity0 's work focuses on the innocence of the close - knit community			1
many of his images are of children and teenages farm life still plays a huge role in the @entity5 community - with children and teenagers pitching in to learn the importance of hard work often when he began photographing his subjects - friends , neighbors and family members - they threatened to tell the minister and have his camera taken away			1
at one point , his camera was briefly confiscated			0
when he first posted his pictures online , he was called in front of the council of elders and forced to delete the images off his @entity144 account in front of them			0
but he kept shooting , anyway , because he felt people outside of his commune needed to understand his community			0
some 45,000 @entity5 live in @entity150 - the vaster majority in western @entity7 and the northern @entity152 if the @entity153 ' the reason why i kept doping it is they constantly had the idea that the outsiders did n't understand how @entity5 work			1
it 's to educate the outside world			0
hutterties are n’t black ad white they are n’t like the @entity74 , ' mr @entity0 said			1
' i 'm still trying to educate people			0
you see @entity5 everywhere but nobody knows @entity5			2
most of the conversations because people want to know about @entity5			2
' @entity0 's subjects were all his friends , family and neighbors - his commune only has a population of 110 farm life : growing food for the commune is one of the primary activities of the @entity5 in the warm months @entity0 now lives 700 miles from home in @entity181 , where he is pursuing his career as a photographer - something that would have been impossible on his @entity5 commune @entity0 described his images as ' warm ' and maintains a high degree of love for his community , despite having to leave there are some 45,000 @entity5 living in @entity150 - most of them in western @entity7 and the northern @entity152 of the @entity153 @entity0 said he wanted to show the outside world what living in a @entity5 commune was like - in an attempt to help people understand his people beauty : @entity0 , who has chosen to live in the modern world , still regards the simple beauty of @entity5 life with respect @entity0 is making a new life for himself as a photographer and working to navigate his new life in the modern world			1

@entity0 grew up in a @entity5 commune in rural @entity6 , @entity7 , and began taking pictures at age 11
he is perhaps the only photographer to show the @entity5 from and insider 's *perspective*
@entity5 are an @entity72 sect that share some values with the @entity75 and @entity74
