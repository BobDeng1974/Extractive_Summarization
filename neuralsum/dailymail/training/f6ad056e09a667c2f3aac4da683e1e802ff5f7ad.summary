suffering sexual and physical abuse at the hands of fellow members , when @entity15 was 19 she resolved to leave the @entity5 the only way she knew how - by secretly becoming pregnant , which went against the rules of the authoritarian @entity4			1
pressured to have an abortion , she fled to relatives in @entity20 , leaving behind the 26 - year - old husband she had married at 15 , her mother , who she has spoken to only once since and a brother who has disowned her			1
scroll down for @entity24 @entity1 pictured with her daughter @entity25 fled the @entity5 and the @entity4 in 1998 that was in 1998 and in the 14 - years since her escape she has raised the daughter the church did n't want and chosen to act as an outspoken critic of @entity5			1
' i was miserable , and it seemed like there was no other way out , ' @entity15 told the @entity35 about the @entity4 which has approximately 5,000 members across the world			1
' if you simply said you wanted to leave , you had to go through a horrible year - long process			1
' at the end , you still might be labeled suppressive and cut off from everyone you know			0
' originally born in @entity20 , where she grew up for the first seven years of her life , @entity15 , her father , mother , grandmother , sister and brother moved to @entity50 , @entity51 where the family enthusiastically worked in the church			1
' after our cozy existence in @entity20 , life among the @entity55 in @entity51 seemed sterile and confining , ' said @entity15 to @entity58 in 2005 ' i saw my mother only about twice a week and when i did , she asked me not to call her @entity61 in front of others			1
' because @entity55 put more importance on titles than on gender , everyone addressed her as ' sir '			0
' to console myself for not having my mother , i made up a little chant , ' i wish i was back in @entity20 , i wish i was back in @entity20			0
two years later , @entity15 's mother @entity70 was advanced enough in her @entity5 career to move to @entity72 where she placed her girl in a @entity75 school , which is a learning arm of the @entity4			1
@entity1 with daughter @entity25 : instilled with the ethics of @entity5 , @entity15 found it very difficult to leave the institution she had grown up within ' i learned the basics of reading , writing , and math , but had no classes in subjects like history or geography , ' said @entity15 to @entity87 ' after school , i worked for hours in the basement of the @entity4 offices , filing papers and doing other organizational tasks			1
' i often stayed there overnight with my fellow students , sleeping on cots			0
' i complained to my father , and he got me into a different school , also run by @entity55			0
' there was no real curriculum ; our teacher spent hours reading to us from @entity103 's science - fiction book @entity102			2
the children were kept together in a dirty compound and dressed in old , torn clothes			1
they often went to school with head lice			1
' there was always a looming threat of hard labor for those who seriously misbehaved , ' said @entity15			2
' at night we drank a beverage we called ' @entity115 , ' a terrible mixture of calcium , magnesium , vinegar , and water			0
' it was supposed to calm us down			0
i 'm 33 years old now and can taste it still when i think of it			0
' around the time that @entity15 was 12 , her father @entity124 left her mother after becoming dissatisfied at the route their lives were going down			2
' i 'd look longingly at the public - school kids walking to class , ' said @entity15			1
' but at the same time , i feared the outside world			0
' i had been told that kids in public school are all on psychiatric drugs			2
' for @entity1 , bringing up her daughter @entity25 outside of @entity5 and the @entity4 meant losing contact with her mother , her husband and her brother deciding to commit herself to the @entity4 after some soul searching , @entity15 attended a two week camp called the @entity146 where she signed the infamous one - billion - year contract			1
' people often married young within the @entity4 , as premarital sex was forbidden , ' explained @entity150			1
' i chose a husband at age 15 , a 22 - year - old named @entity154			1
' i was attracted to him and we had known each other for some time ; we married in @entity158 , with parental consent and a signed order from a judge , as i was underage			1
' we eventually settled into a small room at a @entity4 compound , and i accepted my fate — for the most part			1
' sometimes , i would sneak away at from bed at night and visit my father , and remember that outside world			0
however , once an official member of the @entity4 , events started to spiral for @entity15 , leaving her to doubt her life in the church			1
' one of my first jobs as an official member of the @entity4 was in the security department , meaning i had to make sure people obeyed church rules and ethics , ' said @entity15 to the @entity87			1
' it seemed that people were always in some kind of trouble — the place felt ruled by fear			0
' another thing you could get in trouble for : masturbation			0
' early on in my new job , i had to sit down with a man in his 40s who had admitted to masturbating , and tell him to cut it out			0
i was 15 years old			0
' around this time , @entity15 would sleep with a rope attached to her arm so that that any fellow church members in the same room who tried to escape would be caught			1
@entity15 claims that she was prohibited from speaking to her father and that a former teacher put his hand down her blouse to feel her breast			2
furthermore , @entity15 alleges that one security officer with the church pushed her against a wall , put his hands on her neck while he screamed and spat in her face			1
' a turning point came when i was 17			0
for reasons i do not know — perhaps money - related — members of the @entity4 were suddenly advised not to have children , ' said @entity15			1
@entity1 and her family traveled from the @entity216 to the @entity217 to pursue their devotion to @entity5 ' we were told that a pregnant woman would be turned out of the organization			1
resolving to become secretly pregnant , @entity15 eventually made to escape the @entity4 and fly to @entity20 , but not before she was tracked down to the airport before she flew by her brother and other @entity55			1
' as i got near the security line , i thought with a relief , i 've made it , ' said @entity15			2
' then i heard a familiar voice call , ' @entity15 '			2
it was my older brother , @entity230 and another man i knew			2
' like me they were both members of the @entity4			2
' i assumed they were there for only one reason : to keep me from running away			0
' having ran away from her husband by pretending to do laundry , @entity15 was now faced with her brother determined to bring her back home			2
' i felt a searing pang of fear — and guilt			0
i did n’t want to get @entity230 and my mother in trouble for my escape , but i had to go , ' said @entity15			2
' i ran from him and made it to the plane			0
' 13 - year - old @entity25 ( left ) and her mother @entity1 have lived a life outside of the @entity5 since @entity15 left in 1998 even when she had made it to the relative freedom of @entity20 , @entity15 was conflicted by her emotions , having known nothing but the @entity4 and @entity5 for her entire life			1
' i did n’t want to be viewed as a negative ' suppressive person ' who had left the church without following procedure , abandoning my family , ' said @entity15			1
' so , two months later , i went back to @entity72 to go through an official ' routing out ' procedure			0
' essentially , this meant confessing all my bad deeds over and over again , and eventually signing a document saying i had had a wonderful experience in the @entity4			2
' filing for divorce from her husband whom she has not seen since she left the church , @entity15 gave birth to her daughter @entity25 in september of 1998			2
' i remember being amazed in those early days by the most simple of freedoms , like riding my bike around a nearby park , ' said @entity15			2
' i felt so free			0
even a trip to the grocery store made me happy — i could buy whatever food i wanted			0
' i began working with my father in his architecture firm , and he literally saved me , offering his full support and helping me realize what an oppressive environment i had been in			0
' in the 14 - years since her escape , @entity15 has become a successful architect and her daughter has just finished middle school			1
in the late 1990 's she received a $ 89,000 bill from the @entity4 for the education and lodgings she had received when a member but refused to pay			2
' i saw my mother two years ago , for the first time in a decade , ' said @entity15			0
' her sister , my aunt , had arranged the meeting , in the hopes that we could work things out			0
' i can only describe seeing my mother after all those years as a strange and sad experience			0
' she said she wanted to have a relationship with me , but that i needed to respect her beliefs			0
' i said i could do that			0
i also said i would n’t stop talking publicly about my experience within the church			0
' i have not heard from her since			0
