by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:50 est , 28 october 2013 updated : 06:10 est , 28 october 2013 some of @entity3 ’s biggest sporting events could disappear from the @entity4 unless the corporation cleans up its act			1
ministers have been urged to consider handing the slice of the licence fee used to buy up events like @entity11 and the fa cup to rival broadcasters			1
it is suggested that while the so - called @entity16 events in the sorting calendar should be on free - to - view channels , the @entity4 should not automatically receive the funding to air them			0
sporting highlight : millions watched @entity22 finally win @entity11 in 2013 which is one of the sporting ' crown jewels ' which could be under threat unless the @entity4 cleans up its act the move marks a significant escalation in the row between the @entity4 and the government , in the wake of the @entity33 and @entity34 sex abuse scandals and public outrage at huge payoffs to @entity4 managers			2
@entity39 party chairman @entity38 warned at the weekend that television licence fee could be cut unless the @entity4 tackles a ' culture ' of secrecy , waste and bias			1
but the aggressive approach could go further , with ministers looking at breaking the link between the @entity4 and licence fee itself			1
every year @entity50 spends £ 150million buying the rights to major sporting events , including @entity11 , the @entity53 , @entity55 rugby , @entity56 , which is now shared with @entity57 , and @entity58 highlights for @entity59			1
rival broadcasters believe there should be a level playing field , with the @entity4 unable to give away for free events that they have to pay for			1
warning : @entity39 chairman @entity38 suggested the @entity4 could face a cut in the licence fee or even have to compete with other broadcasters for a share of the money the idea has been put to culture secretary @entity70 to allow them to bid for a slice of the licence fee to air sporting events deemed too important and popular to be restricted to pay - to - view premium channels			1
a source close to mrs @entity70 said : ’ there is a conversation to be had there as to whether the @entity4 should be funding things that are also covered by commercial broadcasters			1
’ there 's an array of sporting events , ’ the source told the @entity85			0
’ it would impact on the licence fee			2
the money that was given to the @entity4 could theoretically be given to other broadcasters who were doing something that we would consider of public service			2
’ the @entity4 covers a whole range of events which private commercial broadcasters pay to cover			2
’ the licence fee is not a given right any more			2
there is an acknowledgement that the change in commercial broadcasters means this is something that needs to be looked at			0
’ if the @entity4 does n't put its house in order we will bring forward talks on the royal charter and start to thrash it out earlier			0
’ the changes could be forced through as part of the renewal of the @entity114 royal charter , due in 2016			0
tories argue that the £ 145.50 - a - year licence fee would be ' too much ' if the @entity4 failed to reform by 2016			1
mr @entity38 , the conservative party chairman , said @entity50 must rebuild confidence following the @entity33 and @entity34 abuse scandals , controversy over fat cat salaries and pay - offs to stars and senior executives			0
scandal : @entity39 chairman @entity38 said the @entity4 needed to regain public trust after a series of scandals including @entity33 's sex abuse he also hinted at @entity39 frustrations with the @entity4 's perceived left - wing bias - saying it faced a ' question of credibility ' over whether it applies ' fairness ' to its political reporting			1
' people pay their licence fee in this country because people believe that we should have public service broadcast program - ming , ' said mr @entity38			1
' of course , there are lots of different ways you could do that			0
i would also say that £ 145.50 is quite a lot to pay for everyone in the country who has a tv			0
' it is too much if we do n't see the kind of reforms that all public organisations are used to , that the @entity4 is n't having to engage with as much as it could do			0
' his intervention brought a sharp response yesterday from the @entity4 's former director - general @entity163 , who accused mr @entity38 of trying to bully the @entity50			2
mr @entity163 said : ' this is an attempt to pressurise and intimidate the @entity4 , which is what governments do , and the @entity4 's job is to resist			0
’ honestly , i 've been waiting for it to happen			0
eighteen months from an election , the government of the day - it does n't matter which government - decides to start pressurising the @entity4 and say , " if we win again , we 're going to take away your money "			0
