' it was two days before @entity29 on a run i ’d done 100 times before			2
' but i came off a jump funny and that was it , i just lay there unable to move			0
' his brother , @entity35 , walked back up the mountain to help him			0
mr @entity8 said : ' i realised it was serious when i saw a hand waving in front of me - and did n’t realise it was my own arm and my brother was waving it			1

' fearless : mr @entity8 is now back on a snowboard after his devastating ain @entity15 six years ago mr @entity46 was then flown to a spinal unit in @entity48 on a stretcher for three months of intensive physiotherapy			1
' that was horrendous , so scary , ' he said			0

' that was hard to hear , especially as doctors could n’t give me hope either			0
but i was always trying to wiggle something , i never let myself rest			0
' loved : the 29 - year - old said family and wife @entity62 , pictured , had been incredibly supportive as he slowly regained his ability to move one day , he finally felt something in his foot , and later his legs - but his upper body remained paralysed			2

' i got my mum to hold my hand and she felt it			0
' the day i made it all the way across the hall with two physios holding me was incredible			0

i am still disabled and that ’s why i know @entity79 is so important for people like me			1
' mr @entity8 is now back to snowboarding and although he is stiff , has lost dexterity and can not feel temperatures , he is determined to keep doing all the activities he loved before he was injured			1
' when i was in hospital and still in a wheelchair unable to move , a young guy from @entity79 came to see me			1
