by @entity0 published : 19:14 est , 27 november 2012 updated : 03:25 est , 28 november 2012 warning : planning minister @entity1 has said that the amount of developed land may increase by a third to ease the housing crisis up to two million acres of green fields may have to be sacrificed for housing , the planning minister warned last night			1
in comments that will alarm conservationists , @entity1 said the amount of developed land may have to increase by up to a third to tackle the growing housing crisis			1
he told @entity11 ’s @entity10 that ministers would protect the @entity13 - but warned that large areas of ‘ open land ’ may have to be given over for housing			1
and he hit out at developers for building ‘ pig ugly ’ housing estates that deter communities from accepting any new development			1
‘ we ’re going to protect the @entity13 but if people want to have housing for their kids they have got to accept we need to build more on some open land , ’ mr @entity1 said : ‘ in the @entity27 and @entity28 at the moment we ’ve got about nine per cent of land developed			1
all we need to do is build on another two to three per cent of land and we ’ll have solved a housing problem			2
’ the @entity27 land mass covers about 60 million acres			2
using another three per cent for housing would mean concreting over 1.8 million acres of undeveloped land			2
mr @entity1 ’s figures suggest that tackling the housing shortage may mean building homes on every square inch of a county the size of @entity43 , which has 1.65 million acres			0
ministers believe the public would be more willing to accept new housing if people realised how much of the countryside remained undeveloped			0
sources at the @entity50 last night insisted that mr @entity1 was ‘ highlighting the scale of the problem ’ rather than setting out a new @entity54 strategy to concrete over the countryside			0
but mr @entity1 said some urban areas were more attractive than the countryside , adding : ‘ the built environment can be more beautiful than nature and we should n’t obsess about the fact that the only landscapes that are beautiful are open - sometimes buildings are better			1
’ sacrificed : as much as two million acres of green fields could be bulldozed to make way for more housing mr @entity1 also declared war on the ‘ pig ugly ’ housing estates built by some developers in recent decades			1
he said it was vital that future developments were more attractive to make them more acceptable to the public			0
he will develop the theme further in a speech to planners tomorrow , telling them : ‘ we are trapped in a vicious circle			0
‘ people look at the new housing estates that have been bolted on to their towns and villages in recent decades and observe that few of them are beautiful			2
indeed , not to put too fine a point on it , many of them are pig - ugly			1
‘ since new housing estates are all too often soulless and formulaic , and those who will inhabit them will add to the pressure on local roads , primary school places and doctor ’s appointments , existing residents oppose any proposal to build new houses on green field sites , even when the land is of low environmental quality			1
‘ local authorities respond to the wishes of local voters by putting too few sites into their local plans			0
and this drives the cost of development land up to stratospheric levels			2
’ mr @entity1 singles out the @entity111 development in @entity112 , @entity113 , describing it as an ‘ overbearing and unbroken slab of dismal brickwork that is an insult to the community it borders ’			0
' pig ugly ' : the minister branded housing developments like @entity111 ( pictured ) as an insult to the community he urges councils to bring forward much more land for housing development , but warns that that if they fail the controversial new ‘ presumption in favour of sustainable development ’ introduced into the planning system this year would be used to ‘ fill the vacuum and make the vital decisions that they are ducking			1
’ mr @entity1 told @entity10 that the right to housing was ‘ a basic moral right , like healthcare and education			1
there ’s a right to a home with a little bit of ground around it to bring your family up in			0
’ he said he was determined to take on so - called @entity145 who oppose local development , saying : ‘ it ’s my job to make the arguments to these people that if they carry on writing letters their kids are never going to get a place with a garden to bring up their grand kids			0
' i accept we have n’t been able to persuade them			0
i think it would be easier if we could persuade them that the new development would be beautiful			0
’ he urges councils to bring forward much more land for housing development , but warns that that if they fail the controversial new ‘ presumption in favour of sustainable development ’ introduced into the planning system this year would be used to ‘ fill the vacuum and make the vital decisions that they are ducking			0

told @entity10 that large areas of ' open land ' may have to go
*blamed* developers making ' pig ugly ' estates for growing *objections* to proposals
