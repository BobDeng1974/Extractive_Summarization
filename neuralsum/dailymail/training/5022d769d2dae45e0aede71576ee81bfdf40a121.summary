' recycling : the @entity28 voted unanimously to support a $ 2.5billion plan to recycle waste water to drinking water			1
the @entity32 , pictured , will decontaminate the water such recycling , called toilet - to - tap by critics , has suffered an image problem that industry insiders call ' the yuck factor			2
' @entity1 , a city of 1.4million people that imports 85 per cent of its water from the @entity42 and @entity3 , has slowly warmed to the idea			1
a 2012 survey by the @entity45 showed that nearly three of four residents favored turning wastewater into drinking water , a major shift from one of four in a 2005 survey			1
' the drought puts a finer point on why this is so necessary , ' mayor @entity52 said			0
' droughts are unfortunately a way of life in @entity3 , so we have to be prepared			2

it has reused wastewater for drinking since 2008 through treatment that includes sending water through ground basins			0
the @entity87 , which serves 1.8million people in the @entity89 , decided in september to pursue construction of facilities that it says could lead to turning wastewater into drinking water for @entity94 and western @entity95			1

unlike @entity77 , @entity1 plans to send water through a reservoir because it lacks groundwater basins			2

' it 's the investment you make for a locally produced , drought - proof water supply , ' he said			0
