@entity1 would probably be alive today if he had not put off conventional medical treatment in favour of alternative remedies , a leading cancer doctor has said			1
dr @entity5 , a researcher at @entity6 , claims the @entity8 boss had a mild form of cancer that is rarely fatal and that his choice of treatment ' eventually led to an unnecessarily early death '			1
writing on @entity15 , a forum frequented by @entity18 executives , dr @entity5 said : ' let me cut to the chase - mr @entity1 allegedly chose to undergo all sorts of alternative treatment options before opting for conventional medicine			1
claims : @entity1 , pictured in june , would probably be alive today if he had not put off conventional medical treatment in favour of alternative remedies , a leading cancer expert said ' given the circumstances , it seems sound to assume that mr @entity1 ' choice for alternative medicine has eventually led to an unnecessarily early death			1
' mr @entity1 died earlier this month due to respiratory arrest caused by pancreatic cancer			2
his death certificate , released by the @entity35 this week , said that mr @entity1 had a ' metastatic pancreas neuroendocrine tumor ' and there would not be an autopsy			1
the certificate also stated that mr @entity1 had the cancer for eight years before his death and that he was first diagnosed in october 2003			2
leading authority : dr @entity5 is an expert on pancreatic cancer who works at @entity6 dr @entity5 claimed that mr @entity1 succumbed to the disease more quickly because of his apparent refusal to embrace ' conventional treatment ' , especially over the last year , the period when he visibly began to lose weight			1
the pancreatic cancer expert wrote : ' it seems that even during this recurrent phase , mr @entity1 opted to dedicate his time to @entity8 as the disease progressed , instead of opting for chemotherapy or any other conventional treatment			1
' for nine months between his diagnosis in 2003 and at least july 2004 , mr @entity1 ' decided to employ alternative methods to treat his pancreatic cancer , hoping to avoid the operation through a special diet ' , according to a 2008 @entity65 article			2
but the rapid advance of the cancer caused mr @entity1 to undergo an operation known as a ' @entity69 ' in which he had his pancreas and duodenum removed			2
dr @entity5 suggests that this procedure , which is only undertaken if the cancer is quickly spreading , might not have been necessary had the @entity8 ceo pursued conventional medicine sooner			1
he wrote : ' the only reason he 'd have a transplant would be that the tumour invaded all major parts of the liver , which takes a considerable amount of time			0
' tributes : a makeshift memorial for mr @entity1 was set - up at @entity8 headquarters in @entity85 , @entity86 , last week dr @entity5 claims that had mr @entity1 had the cancer surgically removed immediately after the disease was diagnosed then he may well have survived with ' no residual side - effects '			1
he added that as mr @entity1 had comparatively mild neuroendocrine tumors , compared to the far more aggressive pancreatic adenocarcinoma tumours that 95 per cent of pancreatic cancer sufferers have			0
he wrote : ' in my series of patients , for many subtypes , the survival rate was as high as 100 per cent over a decade			0
' dr @entity5 said he had the ' profoundest respect for mr @entity1 and his legacy ' and did not wish to offend anyone with his comments			2
but he added : ' i have done 1.5 years of research on the type of tumour that affected @entity1 and have some strong opinions on his case , not only as an admirer of his work , but also as a cancer researcher who has the impression that his disease course has been far from optimal			0
' when contacted by website @entity114 , dr @entity5 said : ' i wrote that on a personal title and it 's my personal opinion			1
' it is unclear what ' special diet ' @entity1 may have adhered to after he was diagnosed with the tumour			0
he was known to be a pescetarian , so ate fish alongside a vegetarian diet			0
he may have consulted a dietician after diagnosis because people with pancreatic disease often find it hard to digest fat			0
enzymes are often prescribed to help break down food as the pancreas is not working as effectively			0
alternative treatments that may relieve symptoms of the disease - such as nausea and pain - include acupuncture , herbal supplements such as plant - derived enzymes and massage therapy			2
however , there is no robust medical evidence any of these could actually fight the @entity147 know that mr @entity1 did n't follow the controversial ' @entity149 protocol ' , which is supposed to treat pancreatic cancer using vegetable juices , 150 daily supplements and having coffee enemas			0
this is because @entity149 himself said the @entity8 - founder had not gone to him			1
he went on to say had @entity1 done so he could have saved his life - although the early termination of a trial comparing chemotherapy to @entity149 ’ protocol would suggest otherwise			2
meanwhile dr @entity163 , from the @entity162 , is cautious about judging mr @entity1 ’ decision to not have immediate treatment			1
he said on sciencebasedmedicine.org : ' while @entity1 certainly did n’t do himself any favours by waiting nine months to undergo definitive surgical therapy of his tumor , it ’s very easy to overstate the potential harm that he did to himself by not immediately letting surgeons re-sect his tumor shortly after it was diagnosed eight years ago			0
' he added : ' there is no information of how large the tumour was upon its discovery or by how much it grew during those nine months			0
whatever the case was , the surgery was apparently a success , with complete removal of the tumour			0
' mr @entity1 originally had an islet cell neuroendocrine tumour , which tend to be slow growing and can be treated even if they spread to the liver .			0

@entity8 ceo 's choice of alternative treatment ' led to an unnecessarily early death ' , dr @entity189 says
