by @entity0 last updated at 1:52 am on 10th september 2011 about one in 100 people in the @entity2 suffer from neuropathic pain for those of us who are martyrs to our backs , help could be at hand – in a few years ' time , anyway			1
scientists claim to have identified the gene behind back pain , in a development that could lead to effective treatment within a decade			2
experts at @entity13 said their research into the @entity16 gene could provide relief to millions			0
about one in seven @entity2 suffers from so - called chronic back pain , which can also include arthritis and headaches			1
this chronic pain comes in two main varieties			2
inflammatory ailments occur when a persistent injury results in very sensitive nerve endings , which increases the sensation of pain			0
the other kind – neuropathic – is felt when nerves are damaged , causing ongoing , and often permanent , pain			2
this is often seen in patients with diabetes and shingles and in the aftermath of cancer chemotherapy – as well as in cases of back pain			0
when researchers removed the @entity16 gene from pain - sensitive nerves in mice , they put a stop to their neuropathic pain			1
however , the mice were still able to feel acute pain , which occurs suddenly , such as when biting one 's tongue			0
professor @entity51 , lead author of the study and head of @entity13 's department of pharmacology , said a drug based on his team 's research could be available within a decade			0
' individuals suffering from neuropathic pain often have little or no respite because of the lack of effective medications , ' he said			1
' our research lays the groundwork for the development of new drugs to treat chronic pain by blocking @entity16			0
' chronic : one in seven @entity2 suffer from back pain which can also include headaches @entity74 clue : the @entity16 gene could provide relief to millions professor @entity51 told the journal science : ' many genes play a critical role in pain sensation , but in most cases interfering with them simply abolishes all pain , or even all sensation			1
' what is exciting about the work on the @entity16 gene is that removing it – or blocking it pharmacologically – eliminates neuropathic pain without affecting normal acute pain			1
' this finding could be very valuable clinically because normal pain sensation is essential for avoiding accidental damage			0
