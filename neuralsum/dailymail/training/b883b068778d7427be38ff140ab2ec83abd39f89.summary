@entity0 has spoken about her conversion to @entity2 for the first time in the new issue of @entity5			1
the mother - of - two , 33 , whose father , @entity7 , is presbyterian , converted in 2009 ahead of her marriage to @entity11 owner @entity10 , whose family are @entity13			1
' it 's been such a great life decision for me , ' she tells the magazine			1
' i am very modern , but i 'm also a very traditional person , and i think that 's an interesting juxtaposition in how i was raised as well			2
her son @entity22 , 17 months , makes a cameo in one of the photos ' i really find that with @entity2 , it creates an amazing blueprint for family connectivity			1
' we observe the sabbath , ' she continues			2
' from friday to saturday we do n't do anything but hang out with one another			2
we do n't make phone calls			1
' but , @entity0 adds , she has been reluctant to discuss the subject in the past			1
' i always shied away from it being a public conversation because it 's such a personal thing , ' she says			2
' we 're pretty observant , more than some , less than others			2
i just feel like it 's such an intimate thing for us			2
' the former model - turned - businesswoman says her marriage is a far cry from her parents ' who divorced in 1992 after 15 years and three children together			1
stealing the show ! a behind - the - scenes snap shows @entity0 's three - year - old daughter @entity50 putting on a performance for the camera @entity53 printed @entity54 available at @entity55 visit site when @entity0 appeared in the pages of @entity5 we knew she would n't be wearing any old rags			1
the young businesswoman opened up her home to the readers of the fashion bible in a $ 9,000 @entity53 dress			2
and we would expect nothing less from the heiress to the @entity68 throne			0
the bold mix of polka dot and floral prints makes a huge style statement			0
spots and botanicals are classic motifs on their own , but when combined they make a daring duo that @entity77 and @entity77 execute flawlessly			0
the risk - taking @entity79 designers did n't play it safe when creating their @entity82 collection with unconventional pairings like flowers with stripes and lace with fringe			1
the silk frock is available at @entity89 by clicking to the right			0
but for most of us , this style is out of our price range			0
not to worry , we 've got spotted options from @entity95 and @entity96 that wo n't break the bank			0
however , our preference goes to @entity101 's @entity100 dress			0
it looks like it was pulled from @entity77 's runway at a fraction of the cost of the original			0
@entity108 at @entity109 visit site @entity112 by @entity111 at @entity113 visit site @entity115 at @entity116 visit site @entity118 at @entity119 visit site family time : @entity0 pictured in an @entity123 snap with husband @entity10 in january taking @entity50 ice - skating at the @entity125 in @entity126 for the first time ' i saw the glamour and the excitement that surrounded my parents , ' she recalls			1
' rooms would hush when they 'd walk in			0
but i think for @entity10 and me , it 's more about real relationships			1
i always prefer smaller groups			0
' the interview with @entity0 appears in the march issue of @entity5 , on newsstands now the couple go out together almost every night , @entity0 reveals , as soon as she has bathed @entity50 , three , and @entity22 , 17 months , and put them to bed			1
indeed , being a hands - on mother is important to her , though she does have the support of a @entity145 nanny , @entity146 , who is teaching the children to speak @entity148			1
' i would say she is definitely the ceo of our household , whereas i 'm more on the board of directors , ' says @entity10			1
' we both pick up slack for each other where it 's needed , but she does n't want to outsource mothering , so she 's very involved			0
' @entity0 jokes that her husband 's idea of a date night is a visit to one of his development sites			1
it 's just as well she shares his passion for real estate development			0
in all seriousness though , the pair seem to have remained besotted with one another , even six years on			0
' you realize in life not that many things matter that much , but your choice of spouse is really everything , ' @entity0 says			1
' i am running a thousand miles a minute , and so is he , but none of it really matters			0
and i would n't be able to do any of it if i did n't have somebody who cared about me and had my best interests in mind			0
' if i was married to somebody who , even if beneath the surface , did n't like the fact that i work so hard or did n't support my ambitions for myself or felt self - conscious about my last name			2
i think it would be very hard to build a solid foundation on that			0
