by @entity0 published : 03:35 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 05:29 est , 7 august 2013 when we look for the ideal holiday destination , one of the most important factors must surely be what sort of welcome we are likely to receive from the locals			0
so travellers will be delighted by a new list which ranks the friendliest cities in the world - as well as naming and shaming the least friendly			1
it turns out that the most welcoming places are in famously chilled - out countries such as @entity14 , @entity15 and the mountain kingdom of @entity17			2
by contrast , the @entity19 dominated the list of the least friendly cities , along with @entity23 and the @entity24 , with @entity25 , @entity18 crowned the most hostile destination			1
bleak : @entity25 , @entity18 , is known mostly for its airport and has been named the world 's least friendly city danger : the terror - wracked city of @entity32 is also not thought to be a very friendly place to visit the lists emerged from the annual @entity36 survey compiled by @entity37 , reflecting the opinions of thousands of jetset readers			1
in addition to the global rankings of friendly and unfriendly cities , the magazine has put together a list of the friendliest @entity19 communities , with the @entity46 taking most of the top spots			2
the ' winner ' of the competition for the least friendly global city was @entity25 , which is known more for its airport than any other attractions			2
one reader polled said : ' i visited @entity25 on business and would not recommend this city for anything , except a cheaper / less busy airport to fly into while visiting other cities			2
' protests : @entity60 , @entity61 is a hotbed of radicalism which frequently erupts into violence slums : @entity66 , the capital of @entity67 , is another city said to be distinctly unfriendly other @entity19 cities in the top 10 included @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 , @entity74 - as well as @entity18 's @entity75 , which despite being a casino resort was denounced as ' a pale shadow of @entity78 '			1
most of the rest of the list was made up of cities which are not usually thought of as popular tourist destinations , such as @entity32 in @entity84 , @entity67 's capital @entity66 , @entity86 and @entity87 , @entity88			0
the friendliest city of all , according to the survey , is @entity91 , in southern @entity14 , a seaside community located on an island and packed with historic colonial architecture			1
the city is known as the ' @entity96 ' , while visitors reported that locals were keen to offer expert advice on how best to make use of their time there			0
friendly : @entity91 in @entity14 has been named the most welcoming city in the world runner - up : @entity110 , in the @entity108 state of @entity109 , is the second friendliest city in the world next is @entity110 , capital of the @entity108 state of @entity109 , which is one of three cities @entity114 to make the top 10 of the list , along with @entity116 in @entity117 and @entity118 , @entity15			1
another country to have multiple entries in the list is @entity17 , a tiny country in the @entity123 between @entity124 and @entity125			0
the nation 's king has a policy of boosting ' gross national happiness ' rather than economic output - and it appears to have paid off , with the cities of @entity132 and @entity133 both named among the 10 friendliest in the world			0
perhaps more surprisingly , @entity135 in @entity136 also made the list - even though the country is currently emerging from decades of brutal military dictatorship			0
the only @entity140 city to appear in the top 20 was @entity142 , at no. 18 , although @entity143 did rather better as @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 were all named among the world 's friendliest			0
idyllic : @entity17 , in the @entity123 , has two entries in the top 10 list thanks to its laid - back culture charm : @entity151 , @entity152 , is the friendliest city in the @entity19 and the fifth friendliest in the whole world in case @entity19 are worried that every city in the @entity19 has a poor reputation , @entity37 has also published its list of the country 's friendliest cities			1
the famed @entity163 hospitality propels the @entity46 to the top of the ranking , with @entity151 , @entity152 in at no. 1			2
it is followed by @entity167 , @entity168 - a rare @entity171 interloper - @entity169 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 , @entity176			0
western states also get recognition for their chilled - out demeanour , with @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 , @entity61 sneaking in to the top 10			0
but not everywhere in @entity61 is considered welcoming - @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 have been named among the 10 least friendly cities in the @entity19 1 ) @entity91 , @entity14 2 ) @entity110 , @entity15 3 ) @entity132 , @entity17 4 ) @entity116 , @entity117 5 ) @entity151 , @entity152 = 6 ) @entity133 , @entity17 = 6 ) @entity118 , @entity15 8 ) @entity135 , @entity136 = 9 ) @entity189 , @entity143 = 9 ) @entity190 , @entity191 1 ) @entity25 , @entity18 2 ) @entity32 , @entity84 3 ) @entity60 , @entity61 4 ) @entity66 , @entity67 5 ) @entity86 , @entity86 6 ) @entity87 , @entity88 7 ) @entity71 , @entity72 8 ) @entity73 , @entity74 9 ) @entity75 , @entity18 10 ) @entity192 , @entity193 tourist hotspot : @entity142 , home to the @entity195 , is considered the @entity140 's friendliest city			1
