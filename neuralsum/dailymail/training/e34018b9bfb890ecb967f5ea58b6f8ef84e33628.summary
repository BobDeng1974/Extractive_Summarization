by @entity0 this is the latest - and cutest - development in wildlife photography ... the animal selfie			2
one was taken by a little lamb which used its nose to touch the screen of a smart phone which had been placed on the ground by a farmer			2
the other is the work of an inquisitive otter which grabbed at a camera to show just how clever he is with his hands			1
flash , bang , wallop : @entity21 the otter snatches a photographer 's camera to catch a classic selfie pose sheepish : the @entity26 lamb used its nose to push the screen of a smartphone on the ground normally associated with celebrities and social networks , these pictures offer a far more natural approach to the photographic genre which has become increasingly popular across the world			1
and perhaps it is no surprise that one of them was taken by an animal known for following the herd			0
farmer @entity42 had placed his handset on the floor of a barn to bottle feed another animal when the three - week - old lamb decided to investigate the gadget			2
the @entity26 lamb , which has not yet been named , apparently pressed his nose against the phone 's touch screen , taking a picture of himself			1
mr @entity54 , who lives near @entity55 , @entity56 , posted the image on @entity58 , explaining : ' he managed to borrow the phone to take a selfie			1
@entity21 and a companion peered excitedly into the lens at @entity63 in @entity64 @entity65 , the photographer whose camera was nabbed , said @entity21 ' snatched it in both paws ' ' he nicked the phone while i was bottle feeding his sister ! he 's bright ! ' the 61 - year - old added : ' i was just topping them up with the bottle because the ewe is only producing milk from one of her udders			1
' i tried to take a photograph of the ewe but she was a bit suspicious of the phone and she did n't like it much			0
' but then the lamb 's bossy brother came barging in and was really engaged by the phone			0
he was certainly not camera shy			0
' meanwhile , @entity21 , an otter at the @entity91 in @entity64 , grabbed the kit of professional photographer @entity65 , who explained : ' i had just put the camera down and the otter came up to the bars and snatched it in both paws			1
this little @entity55 lamb , which has yet to be named , made farmers on @entity100 burst out laughing he was fumbling around the hay on the ground when he happened upon @entity42 's phone ' the female otter was in the background and did n't seem too interested in him showing off			1
' i burst out laughing when i saw it and knew it would have taken a funny picture			0
' the craze for selfies has gone mad			2
' @entity113 , grounds and facilities manager at the centre , said : ' they are very playful and inquisitive animals			0
' in the wild they tend to live in family units so they are quite happy being in people 's company and interact with visitors			0
@entity124 of the @entity125 near @entity55 , @entity56 , was shocked when she noticed the selfie ' @entity21 loves shiny pebbles and his trick is to lie on his back and do a juggling act with them			1
' a ' selfie ' is the name given to a self - portrait photograph , typically taken using a hand - held digital camera or camera phone , and posted on social networking sites			0
the most famous one ever taken was by this year 's @entity139 host @entity138 , and included a group of @entity142 a-listers			0
the poses are often casual , taken with the camera held at arm 's length or into a mirror , and typically feature only the person - or animal - taking the picture			0
a recent survey showed that @entity151 take around 35million ' selfies ' a month .			1

@entity26 lamb in @entity55 , @entity56 , used nose to work smartphone
@entity21 the otter in @entity64 grabbed a camera on floor with his hands
latest in craze as study shows 35m @entity151 take selfies each month
