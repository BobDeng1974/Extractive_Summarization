smoking prevalence among @entity2 's adult population is set to drop below 20 per cent for the first time in a century smoking among @entity2 's adult population is set to drop below 20 per cent for the first time in a century , it was revealed today			1
an ongoing survey of tobacco use is expected to show the turning point being crossed by the end of this year			1
the proportion of smokers in @entity2 dipped as low as 20.1 per cent in 2011 , when the last yearly results from the survey were published , but never quite reached the ' psychologically significant ' 20 per cent watermark			2
researchers plan to publish more figures at the end of this year			1
unless there is a highly unlikely u-turn in the current trend , they will show that less than a fifth of people in @entity2 now smoke			1
professor @entity22 , from @entity23 , who co-heads the @entity26 , said : ‘ 2013 is going to be , almost without doubt , the first year for a hundred years where we 're solidly below 20 per cent smoking prevalence in @entity2			1
it 's going to be a big year			2
‘ we are making progress			0
it 's slow , and we 'd like it to be quicker , but things are going in the right direction			2
’ the @entity26 tracks smoking habits in adults over the age of 16 every month and publishes the results online			2
researchers conduct household surveys to collect information from around 1,800 people			2
currently , it shows that average smoking prevalence across @entity2 is 19.1 per cent , with a marked difference between populations at the top and the bottom of the socio - economic scale			0
among those in the upper and middle a , @entity52 and @entity53 social brackets , only around 13 per cent smoke			1
but tobacco is part of the lives of more than a quarter of people classified as @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 tobacco use is recognised as the single biggest cause of preventable disease and early death in the @entity66 , claiming more than 102,000 lives a year			1
smoking causes around 86 per cent of deaths from lung cancer , 80 per cent of deaths from bronchitis and emphysema , and 17 per cent of deaths from heart disease			1
in 1948 , when smoking surveys began , 82 per cent of men in the @entity66 were smokers			1
smoking prevalence fell rapidly between the 1970s and 1990s after which it has continued a slow decline			0
smoking causes around 86 per cent of deaths from lung cancer ( pictured ) , 80 per cent of deaths from bronchitis and emphysema , and 17 per cent of deaths from heart disease professor @entity22 said the long term reduction in smoking prevalence showed no sign of coming to an end			1
‘ we do n't see that happening in @entity2 , ’ he said			0
‘ the decline now is between about 0.5 and one percentage point a year which is a pretty decent rate			0
there 's no evidence that it 's plateauing			0
’ he added that @entity101 policies such as raising tobacco pricing , mass media campaigns and services to help smokers quit ‘ definitely ’ played a role in cutting tobacco consumption			0
he warned there was no room for complacency , as had been seen in @entity111 where no attempt was made to follow up a big hike in tobacco prices			0
smoking rates dropped sharply for a time , but then prevalence started to rise again			0
‘ you definitely need to keep bearing down on it , ’ professor @entity22 added .			0

by the end of the year it 's expected less than a fifth of @entity66 will smoke
among the upper and middle classes about 13 ****%**** of people smoke
*25* ****%**** of people in the lower social brackets are smokers
smoking causes 86 ****%**** of lung cancer deaths and 80 ****%**** of bronchitis deaths
