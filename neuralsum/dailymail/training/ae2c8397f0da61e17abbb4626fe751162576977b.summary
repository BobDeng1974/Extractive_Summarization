the sister of murdered honeymoon bride @entity1 has made an emotional plea for the judge not to halt the trial of @entity5 without hearing the accused ’s version of events			1
@entity8 , the victim ’s elder sister , said she and her family would never be able to ‘ move on ’ without hearing what businessman mr @entity5 had to say in his defence			1
judge @entity13 last week adjourned the trial in @entity15 for a fortnight to assess mr @entity5 ’s claim that the case should be thrown out for lack of evidence because prosecution witnesses were unreliable			1
but mrs @entity8 , 37 , an engineer , said : ‘ what about us , as @entity29 ’s family ? we need to hear what he has to say			2
‘ we have been waiting for years , sitting through each and every hearing just to know what he can tell us about how @entity29 died			0
‘ at times , our patience has worn thin			0
but , as @entity29 ’s family , we always believed it was important to maintain dignity and allow the courts of law to follow the full due process			0
‘ but i wonder how we are going to live our lives knowing that half of the story is missing ? ’ mr @entity5 , 34 , denies any involvement in his wife ’s murder in november 2010 , two weeks after he married her in a £ 200,000 wedding in @entity63			1
@entity29 was found dead after the taxi she was travelling in with her husband of two weeks was carjacked in a township on the outskirts of @entity15			2
@entity5 , pictured , denies all involvement in his wife 's murder in @entity15 in november 2010 mr @entity5 and the driver , @entity71 , were freed unharmed , while the 28 - year - old bride was found the following morning with a single gunshot wound to her neck			1
the @entity76 businessman is alleged to have masterminded the hit on his wife after asking @entity71 to stage a robbery and engage two gangsters to kill her			0
mrs @entity8 , speaking at her home in @entity83 , said : ‘ we absolutely respect the judge and the court			2
however , it would just not be fair of her to make a judgment to end the case before she has heard everything			0
‘ there are inconsistencies in what @entity5 has said to the police and to my family and these need to be cleared up , once and for all			2
‘ we heard from the three men who were in the taxi and who have been convicted and now we need to hear @entity5 tell his story			2
as @entity29 ’s family , we are never going to be able to move on unless we hear what he has to say about what happened			0
’ mr @entity5 fought a three - and - a - half - year legal battle to avoid extradition from @entity107 to @entity24 after an arrest warrant was issued to take him back and put him on trial			1
mrs @entity8 said : ‘ we have always thought so highly about the @entity24 justice system and it could be about to hit us in the face if it makes a judgment before hearing the case in full			1
i was at work and i could n’t stop crying			0
it does n’t feel fair			0
‘ if the judgment comes with her hearing the full story and he is declared innocent , then i would say , “ okay , he did n’t do it			0
” and it would be easier to accept			0
’ on the first day of the trial mr @entity5 confessed through lawyers to paying gay prostitutes for sex and declared himself bisexual			1
but a @entity128 - based rent boy and a senior @entity130 officer were banned from revealing details of mr @entity5 ’s sex life by the judge and he has not yet been cross-examined .			1
