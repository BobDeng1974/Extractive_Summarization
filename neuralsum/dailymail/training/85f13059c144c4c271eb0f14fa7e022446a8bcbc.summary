a dog ’s owner may not notice how fast their pet is growing , especially if they see them every day			2
but one owner from @entity7 did n’t want to miss a week of his @entity9 ’s development so created this lovely time - lapse			1
the 23 - second clip shows @entity14 ’s dog @entity12 growing from a two - month old puppy into a fully - grown three - year - old			1
it shows the development of his @entity9 , @entity12 as she grows from two months ( pictured ) to three years in just 23 seconds			1
this is then reversed to show @entity12 shrinking back to a puppy this is then reversed to show @entity12 shrinking back to a puppy			1
the footage was taken by mr @entity14 , a senior art director at @entity26 , every weekend , with help from his wife @entity28			1
it ends with outtakes that show mrs @entity31 attempting to keep @entity12 still during the filming			1
mr @entity14 wrote on @entity33 : ‘ this is a pet project we 've been working on for three years , that 's finally completed			1
' it 's been amazing watch our little lady grow from a little burrito to the beautiful beast she is today			0

it ends with outtakes that show mrs @entity31 attempting to keep @entity12 ( pictured at three years old ) still during the filming the fastest growth of a puppy occurs between four and six months			1
by the time it ’s a year old , a dog 's skeleton is usually fully developed , although it may continue to develop in larger breeds for the next six months to a year			2
in mr @entity14 's video , @entity12 's rear legs are shown getting longer and larger even after this time			1
by three months , a puppy typically has a full set of baby teeth , which are replaced by adult teeth at around five months			2
it is likely the dog will begin a chewing phase at this point			0
puberty typically begins at around four months old and sexual maturity can hit as early as six months			0
between seven and nine months , a puppy will begin exploring more of their environment , and this can lead to a second chewing phase			2
the testosterone level in male puppies increases up to seven times higher than in an adult dog by the time it reaches 10 months , which can cause a growth spurt			2
this falls to a normal level by 18 months			0
doggy paddle is one of the first strokes children develop when learning to swim , but despite inspiring the name , research has discovered dogs do n’t paddle in water at all			0
instead , they perform a more complex cycle of movements ( pictured ) underwater to maximise their speed through the waves and reduce drag doggy paddle is one of the first strokes children develop when learning to swim , but despite inspiring the name , research has discovered dogs do n’t paddle in water at all			0
instead , they perform a more complex cycle of leg movements underwater designed specifically to maximise their speed through the waves and reduce drag			0
professor @entity105 from @entity106 used underwater cameras to film eight dogs , across six different breeds , as they swam across a pool , when a dog trots on land , their front paw rises and falls in time with the hind paw on the opposite side			2
for example , the left front paw will rise and fall with right hind paw			0
however , when a dog runs on land , in order to increase its speed , the legs move in a more complex , cyclical way			0
the left hind paw lands first , followed by its left front paw , right hind paw and right front paw in sequence			0
as the dog runs further , the legs rise in the same pattern .			0
