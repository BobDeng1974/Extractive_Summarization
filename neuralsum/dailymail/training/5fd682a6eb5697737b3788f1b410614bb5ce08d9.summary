by @entity0 @entity1 now boast an attacking triumvirate to rival the best in the @entity4			2
in adding @entity5 to @entity6 and @entity7 , @entity8 has assembled a front three which will certainly make for exciting viewing this season			1
but how do they compare to each other ? @entity13 's @entity0 takes a closer look … @entity5 @entity15 goals are the currency in which the @entity19 trades , with @entity5 once admitting he is ‘ obsessed ’ with finding the back of the net			2
his numbers tally ; 155 goals in 200 games since moving to @entity26 in 2009			1
like @entity28 , though , you ca n’t score from the treatment room , but if he ’s on the park then goals are as good as guaranteed			0
@entity32 : 9/10 guaranteed : @entity1 's deadline day signing @entity5 's stock in trade is goals assists his obsession with goals evidently does n’t extend to laying them on for team - mates			1
indeed , he has made just four in the past three seasons , although 73 chances created suggests his colleagues may have let him down in converting such opportunities – @entity5 himself would not be so wasteful			0
@entity32 : 7/10 leadership he ’s never been a captain but has a powerful personality and an aura which should inspire others			0
his presence on the pitch can only be a good thing for a team lacking character in the past 12 months			0
@entity32 : 7/10 strong return : @entity5 's scored 155 goals in 200 games since his move to @entity26 @entity62 his picture populated pretty much every back page across @entity26 following his deadline - day move to @entity66 , and that is evidence enough of his star attraction			1
in the @entity4 and @entity1 he now has a stage to amplify his allure			0
@entity32 : @entity72 total : 31.5/40 @entity6 @entity15 in 10 seasons at @entity1 his numbers equate to as good as one goal every two games			1
but that ratio is old money , the top strikers today return at least two in three ( like @entity81 ) or one in one ( like @entity82 )			1
@entity6 was at the peak of his powers in 2012 – 34 goals bear testament to such – but his potency is on the wane and you fear the days of him plundering 20 - plus league goals are a thing of the past			0
@entity32 : @entity95 falling short : @entity6 's return of a goal every two games is well short of top , top strikers these days assists @entity6 is arguably a better creator of goals than scorer of them - he had a hand in 19 for team - mates in all competitions last season - and few can rival him when it comes to picking a deft pass in and around the danger zone			1
@entity32 : 9/10 provider : of @entity1 's star trio , @entity6 is the best at laying on goals for others and picking out deft a pass leadership let ’s be honest , his @entity119 captaincy came about by default and , at @entity1 , only @entity28 represented a realistic rival			1
rather , it is @entity6 ’s reputation and status which has seen him inherit the armband for club and country , for he is not a natural leader in the mould of @entity133 , @entity134 or @entity135			1
@entity32 : @entity136 default : who else could @entity138 have handed the @entity119 captaincy to after @entity140 retired @entity62 @entity143 commercials , @entity141 covers , @entity6 is still a huge name off the field			2
on it , however , he has to repair a reputation damaged by another failed showing at a major tournament and , of course , the disappointment of last season with @entity1			0
@entity32 : @entity95 total : 30.5/40 @entity7 @entity15 his first season at @entity66 was phenomenal and , without his 26 goals , sir @entity156 would not have signed off with a @entity4 title			1
but you ca n’t get goals from the stands and @entity28 ’s fitness issues could hinder his chances to recreate that free - scoring form			0
do n’t forget , he has only netted more than 20 league goals in two seasons during his entire career – his last at @entity167 and first at @entity66			0
@entity32 : 8/10 injury prone : @entity7 's extensive time off the pitch has diminished his value better days : @entity28 is a long way from his 26 - goal season that helped sir @entity156 retire as a winner assists he ’s a little more selfish than @entity6 but nonetheless has still carved 21 goals for comrades over the last three seasons , his vision and cute left boot having created an impressive 180 chances in that same period			1
@entity32 : 8/10 leadership captain of his country under @entity187 , @entity28 still does n’t fall in the category of chest - thumping general			0
there is a maturity about his mindset and persona , however , and he automatically commands respect from team - mates			0
@entity32 : @entity95 commands respect : @entity28 is n't a chest - beating general but is revered within @entity1 's ranks @entity62 he ’s not as interested as @entity6 in promoting the ‘ brand ’ , but ability and reputation has it that he remains a global star			2
his diving header against @entity205 at the @entity206 did him no harm in that respect , but memory of last season in the @entity4 – form and fitness having eluded him – means he has a point to prove this time around			0
@entity32 : @entity95 total : 31/40 spectacular : @entity28 's goal against @entity205 for @entity216 was among the @entity206 's great moments * does not include one @entity219 appearance			2

@entity5 signed for @entity1 on loan on deadline day
the @entity225 striker has scored 155 goals in 200 games in @entity26
@entity6 is @entity119 and his club 's captain , but not a natural leader
@entity6 's goal return of one every two games is below other top strikers
@entity7 scored 26 goals in sir @entity156 's *farewell* season
but he has *struggled* with injury and is nowhere near that form
