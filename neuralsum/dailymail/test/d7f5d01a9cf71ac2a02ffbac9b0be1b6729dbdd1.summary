the @entity2 cricket team 's involvement with multi-billion - pound fraudster @entity3 — an all - time low point — has been defended by @entity6 cricket legend sir @entity5			1
great fast bowler @entity5 never spoke to the media during his playing career but launched his aptly titled autobiography @entity9 to talk on the eve of the @entity6 - @entity2 series			2
@entity5 was one of the @entity6 stars , along with sir @entity14 and @entity15 , who accompanied @entity16 when he flew by helicopter to the @entity19 's nursery ground in 2008 to launch his five - year deal with @entity2 that ended with his arrest and subsequent 110 - year jail sentence , just one $ 20million @entity24 game into the contract			1
the @entity2 cricket team 's involvement with @entity3 has been defended by sir @entity5 @entity16 's deal with @entity2 @entity2 ended with his arrest and subsequent 110 - year jail sentence @entity5 wrote : ' i was n't surprised the @entity30 officials were taken in by him			1
his vision to improve @entity6 cricket by using @entity2 seemed a hard one to argue with			0
but we felt that having @entity2 as the same opponents over that period would turn things stale			0
' @entity15 said : ' he employed a lot of people in several businesses and built a stadium			0
he did a lot of good			0
we thought what he was doing was legitimate			0
' @entity44 added : ' to a lot of fellers here , he did well			0
' @entity5 accompanied @entity16 when he flew to the @entity19 's nursery ground in 2008 to launch the deal the new @entity30 president @entity49 did not want to discuss the @entity16 legacy saying it was a long time ago however , the new @entity30 president @entity49 , who negotiated the doomed deal and greeted @entity16 on his arrival at @entity54 with a bear hug , did not want to discuss the @entity16 legacy			1
before the @entity58 launch last week at which he made a fool of himself by haranguing both the guest speaker and @entity58 editor @entity61 , @entity49 would only say of @entity16 : ' that was all a long time ago			0
' perhaps it 's no surprise , with @entity16 's decaying cricket stadium just outside @entity65 's airport there for all visitors to see , that @entity49 is swerving today 's first test on the island			2
@entity69 might still be a long way from agreeing terms and working patterns to become @entity2 's director of cricket			2
but he is staying at @entity2 's luxury @entity76 in @entity65 , so he 's right in the middle of any politics going on over the appointment of a director and ideally placed to judge the mood music of players and management			1
director of cricket hopeful @entity69 is staying at @entity2 's luxury @entity76 in @entity65 @entity2 rugby head coach @entity85 seems unperturbed by criticism that after four successive second places in the @entity88 , he 's been talking the talk , rather than walking the walk			1
@entity91 has a speaking engagement a week today in aid of the @entity94 along with sir @entity95 , @entity96 and captain @entity97 at a £ 225 - a - head function			0
the @entity99 say all @entity91 's talks in the run - up to the @entity102 are for charity			0
@entity85 seems unperturbed by criticism that he 's been talking the talk , not walking the walk the @entity108 peak viewing figure of 8.8million proved that this is one event on the racing calendar that @entity110 invariably get right , even without @entity111			1
and the occasion was a personal triumph for regular racing presenter @entity114 , who proved that @entity115 did n't need a @entity116 or @entity117 when @entity111 defected to commentate on the men 's and women 's @entity118 for the @entity121			0
the @entity108 peak viewing figure of 8.8million proved @entity110 got their coverage right regular racing presenter @entity114 proved that @entity110 did n't need a @entity116 or @entity117 that 's a @entity127 , @entity128 @entity129 being interviewed by cricket journalists on the eve of his 100th test when he is just four wickets from becoming @entity2 's record test bowler , was asked what advice he would give young bowlers starting their international careers			1
@entity129 replied ' ignore the media ' , which even if meant ' tongue in cheek ' , as he later claimed , was a pretty crass thing to say as someone who has benefited hugely over the years from money for newspaper columns			0
meanwhile , captain @entity145 said he had learned of @entity146 's century yesterday from @entity148 's @entity147 while being interviewed			2
surely the @entity30 should have briefed him about @entity146 's exploits — the elephant in the room — before his media duties			2
@entity129 was asked what advice he would give young bowlers and replied : ' ignore the media ' cricket feuds do n't always last as long as the 40 - year enmity between sir @entity157 and @entity158			1
@entity159 has seemed one of @entity146 's fiercest opponents since his @entity2 banishment but after a handshake of welcome in @entity165 during the first @entity102 semi-final they worked happily together for @entity148			1
@entity159 ( left ) and @entity146 ( centre ) worked together for @entity148 after their feud			2

the @entity30 's involvement with fraudster @entity3 has been defended
sir @entity5 said he thought @entity16 did ' a lot of good ' in deal
@entity69 is staying at @entity2 's @entity76 in @entity65
@entity85 is unperturbed by claims that he has n't walked the walk
the @entity108 peak viewing of 8.8million was good for @entity110
@entity129 said he would tell young bowlers to : ' ignore the media '
@entity159 and @entity146 's feud seems to have ended
