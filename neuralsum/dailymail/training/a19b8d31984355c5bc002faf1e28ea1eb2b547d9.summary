by @entity0 there is always another saviour just around the corner			2
a serious player with serious money , seriously promising great things			2
an answer to the prayers of supporters			2
anyone willing to heed the multiple warnings from recent history , though , will know that a club in financial trouble is often prey to the worst kind of opportunist			1
and that many a potential white knight turns out to be anything but a source of stability			2
the pattern is now well established			2
a club with a great history but pressing problems gets into trouble , is sold on or snapped up out of insolvency by one fast - talking ‘ character ’ , then punted to someone a bit more low - rent , before eventually winding up owned by … well , let ’s not go there			1
rangers have endured serious financial difficulties over the last decade , causing them to be relegated think of @entity35			1
from @entity36 to the impressive - sounding @entity37 , then on to current owner @entity38			0
at least assuming the @entity39 does n’t lose an impending court case , forcing him to sell on to an other			0
think , too , of @entity43			1
now a beacon of hope , owned and run by supporters , they were passed through the hands of umpteen questionable characters before being saved by the fans			1
@entity51 have actually engaged with their counterparts at @entity33 regularly in a bid to provide help — if only by example — on the subject of a fans ’ takeover , something that has failed to gain much traction around @entity60			1
trust chairman @entity62 , who also serves as a director on board , understands that it ’s a huge leap for any set of supporters to make			0
until , that is , things get truly desperate			0
detailing the litany of disasters that befell his team before the community rallied , @entity62 told @entity74 : ‘ our ownership tale is like a work of fiction , almost			0
@entity33 even had @entity80 owners who now face an extradition order in connection with bank fraud ‘ we even had an owner that no one has been able to prove actually existed , although the belief is that he ’s a low - level accountant working somewhere in the @entity87 and his name was used by others			1
‘ more recently we had @entity80 owners who are now under an extradition order in connection with hundreds of billions of dollars in fraud from @entity80 banks			0
‘ the people we had to fight off at the very last moment , led by @entity95 , included a guy whose father was subsequently assassinated — and he had to go into hiding himself			0
‘ there are countless examples of people who did own the club , or who we had to fight off , who came under all sorts of weird and wonderful categories			1
there were proven mafia connections in one case			0
‘ i hope it does n’t get as bad as it did for us — for any club in the country			1
but , if there is a key message i would give to @entity33 fans , it is that it ’s quite amazing how much power you can have if you work together			1
‘ we ’ve spoken to people from the @entity125			0
they ’ve been keen to hear what we did and how we did it			0
‘ the biggest problem football fans in general have is that fans do n’t tend to rally all in the same direction — until things are in such a tremendously dire strait			1
’ some @entity33 fans may still be waiting for @entity134 , a potential saviour who told fans not to buy tickets many @entity33 supporters may still be waiting for @entity134 , one of the potential saviours who urged fans not to buy season tickets , dangling the carrot of increased fan involvement when — not if — he swept to power			1
until then , do supporters merely hope that one of the board - approved investment avenues being explored — an overseas backer here , a shares issue there — is enough to put everything back on an even keel ? ‘ it is natural for fans just to jump at someone coming in offering to pour money in , ’ said @entity62			1
‘ we know full well that there are plenty of fans out there who do n’t care about the accounts and the bottom line			1
‘ they want a £ 5million striker — it does n’t matter if the company is £ 150m in debt , as long as he ’s scoring goals			0
there are a lot of fans who are happy to bury their heads in the sand until it ’s too late			1
‘ often you find that supporters who try to point out the reality of the situation are the ones accused of scaremongering — told to keep quiet and support their team			0
until it ’s too late			0
if @entity33 fans united , like @entity43 supporters did , they might not have to rely on outside saviours ‘ you have to remember one thing on any ownership , foreign or domestic			1
the idea of a @entity191 , who says : “ you know what , i ’ve got quite a large bank account , i ’m going to give a few million to my favourite football club because i love it so much ” , that is incredibly rare			1
‘ even the ones with money come in and effectively lend the club money — often at high interest rates			1
that ’s something that we found , that the club was paying back loans way above commercial interest rates			2
‘ we had a series of poor owners , so the will to do something built up over the years			0
‘ we were also helped by the club being in administration			2
the last time it fell into administration for quite a long period , almost 18 months			0
that gave us a chance to do something ‘ often administrations are much shorter			0
the club is liquidated or yet another undesirable owner will come in , wave a few million pounds and take the club away again			2
’ if that sounds familiar , the current scenario at @entity220 will certainly ring a bell at @entity60 , @entity224 spokesman @entity223 telling @entity74 : ‘ we ’ve been through a few takeovers now			0
@entity36 , then the @entity227 lot , now mr @entity38 — who i do think has the best interest of the club at heart , even if he ’s upset some people			2
‘ when these guys come around making the promises , it is easy for some supporters to grab at the hope			0

@entity33 has been owned by *numerous* *suspect* parties in recent times
@entity43 and @entity35 suffered similar *journeys*
but @entity51 fans united and now run their own club
if @entity33 followed suit they would *n't* have to rely on outside ' saviours '
