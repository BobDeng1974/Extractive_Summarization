the seven year itch is the psychological theory that happiness in couples starts to deteriorate after seven years together , increasing the chances of a break - up			1
the phrase became world - famous after @entity8 starred in a film of the same name in 1955 , where she plays an attractive actress who becomes the focus of a married man 's affections			1
but new research shows that psychologists got it wrong - the point in a marriage when a couple is most unhappy , therefore most likely to stray , is actually the ten - year mark			2
the seven year itch is theory that love begins to fade in couples at this time			1
the idea was made world - famous in 1955 film starring @entity8 and @entity27			1
but a new study says the point when couples are most likely to split is actually ten years a study involving more than 2000 women born between 1957 and 1964 questioned their feelings about their marriage over 35 years			1
during the interviews , students at @entity35 in @entity36 found that in two thirds of marriages , happiness started at high levels but then steadily declined			0
women revealed themselves to be most unhappy in their relationships after ten years together			0
researchers suggest that this point coincides with when the females are juggling the biggest workloads both in household chores and childcare			0
women revealed themselves to be most unhappy in their relationships after ten years @entity50 suggest that this point coincides with when the females are juggling the biggest workloads both in household chores and childcare but these levels of discord are short - lived , just five years later , women began to argue much less with their partners			2
those who managed to stay together for more than three decades found that their levels of happiness began to grow again , although for most it never reached the same levels as when they first got married			0
couples at this stage in their relationship also argued less than they had at any point in their marriage			0
the researchers linked this upwards turn in emotion with the point when a couple 's children reached the age of financial independence .			0
