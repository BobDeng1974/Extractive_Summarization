one month and a day after their first data dump of private information stolen while hacking @entity3 , the now infamous @entity4 seem to have gone quietly into the night , failing to deliver the much hyped ' @entity6 gift ' they claimed would destroy the studio			1
' we are preparing for you a @entity6 gift , ' the group posted online in mid-december			1
' the gift will be larger quantities of data			2
and it will be more interesting			0
the gift will surely give you much more pleasure and put @entity20 into the worst state			2
' yet days later a letter released by the hackers on december 18 said that @entity3 had ' suffered enough			1
the promise of more @entity3 secrets being revealed has so far failed to materialize a man wearing a @entity36 outfit leads cinema goers in @entity38 , @entity39 , in a sing along of @entity40 to be an @entity42 ahead of a screening of the interview since then the hackers appear to have turned their attention to the @entity47 and on december 21 they posted a message which cynically ' praised ' the @entity47 's investigation into the hack , with a link yo a video that repeated the phrase ' you are an idiot ' repeatedly			1
on christmas day , people flocked to the 300 or so cinemas showing the movie			2
' we are taking a stand for freedom , ' said theater manager @entity61 of the @entity62 in @entity63 , where most of thursday 's seven screenings had sold out by early afternoon			0
' we want to show the world that @entity42 will not be told what we can or can not watch			0
personally , i am not afraid			0
' at @entity30 's @entity69 , a sell - out crowd thursday hailed the film 's release , washing down popcorn with beer and cocktails and uniting for a boisterous sing - along of ' @entity75 ' before the opening credits			0
' this is way more fun than it would have been , ' said @entity79 of @entity30 , who waited outside with his daughter , @entity80			0
the elder @entity81 added , with mocking sarcasm , ' this is almost dangerous , like we 're living life on the edge			0
' while the @entity4 may be done , a new hacking group has already stepped in and taken their place , managing to shut down the company 's @entity89 at the worst possible time - @entity6			1
game over : the @entity3 hack that resulted in the leak of thousands of emails exchanges between @entity96 heavyweights including studio head @entity97 ( right ) and @entity98 ( left ) seems to be over no backlash : this despite the fact that @entity3 decided to reverse their decision made last week to shelve the film following threats of a terrorist incident according to @entity107 , a group called @entity106 is taking credit for the hack , which managed to put the network out of commission for hours not just once , but twice during the holiday			1
they are also claiming to have done the same to @entity114			0
this hack pales in comparison however to the damage inflicted on @entity3 and its employees as a result of the @entity121 hack			1
and of those employees , no one has had to endure more than studio head @entity97 , whose work emails were released on a near daily basis			0
the hackers began their reign of terror on november 24 by hacking into employee computers and displaying a flashing skull with a cryptic message informing workers ' we 've obtained all your internal data			2
' the computers would remain down for over a week , and a few days later the hackers deliver their first of many shocking dumps when the leak the @entity138 war drama @entity139 as well as unreleased studio titles including @entity141 , mr. @entity142 , @entity143 and to write @entity144 online			0
it was around this time in late november that speculation began to mount that @entity148 was likely behind the hack , a claim that seems to be based on nothing other than the fact that the country 's @entity154 ambassador @entity153 wrote a letter to @entity154 secretary general @entity157 taking issue that a film that depicts the assassination of a sitting world leader was allowed to be made , let alone released			1
and although the @entity4 fail to even address these claims , or make any demands of @entity3 , until well into december , the story continues to grow and is accepted by many as fact long before the @entity47 claims to have actual proof of the country 's involvement			1
deny : following an @entity47 report that @entity148 was behind the attack , @entity172 ( above ) released a statement denying the allegation and attacking the @entity42 it is in december that the hackers really turn things up , dumping an astonishing amount of information in the first two weeks of the month			1
salaries of the company 's top executives become public , the script for the new @entity182 film is leaked , and then there are the emails attacking an assortment of a-list actors , writers and directors , along with a racist exchange between @entity193 and her frequent pen - pal in many of these leaked emails , producer @entity98 , in which the two mock president @entity198 by listing what his favorite movie might be			0
the two would later release individual public apologies for their comments			0
this racist exchange is still being addressed by @entity193 , who flew to @entity206 to meet with @entity207 and has given the go ahead to a new program dedicated to promoting racial diversity in film			0
@entity193 does however manage to come off as respectful and understanding when speaking about many of @entity96 's biggest stars , save one incident in which she labels @entity217 an ' a * * hole ' not once , but twice			0
@entity98 on the other hand seems to have no problem talking about the talent behind their back , particularly @entity224 who he labels ' a minimally talented spoiled brat ' in one email , and in another exchange actually removes from the chain in order to tell @entity193 that the actress is ' out of her mind			0
' during this time the group also starts dumping employee medical records , and most notably there letter on december 8 demanding that @entity3 stop the release of their upcoming @entity238 assassination film @entity29			1
then , on december 13 with the scandal at near fever pitch , the group announces plans for their upcoming ' christmas gift ' which they say will put @entity3 ' into the worst state			1
' then things go quiet until december 16 , when the group follows up their demand by threatening a terrorist attack of any movie theater set to play the interview when it is released on december 25			2
everywhere : the film has now been released across three viewing platforms - theaters , on demand and online by day 's end , the four largest theater chains in the country announce they will not show the film , and the following day @entity3 cancels the film 's release			1
it is then that the @entity4 release the aforementioned december 18 letter saying the @entity3 has suffered enough			1
things finally turned around on wednesday however for @entity3 , when @entity6 came exactly one day early and the studio was able to declare victory over their hackers by releasing @entity29 online			1
making the release even sweeter for @entity3 was the massive outpouring of public support for the film , with thousands turning out for christmas eve midnight screenings across the country and tens of thousands of @entity42 streaming the film online			1
and as an added bonus for @entity3 , the studio will now go down in the history books for becoming the first studio to release a major motion picture online , as well as being the first studio to simultaneously allow for the viewing of a film across three different platforms - theaters , online and video on demand			2
' it has always been @entity3 's intention to have a national platform on which to release this film , ' @entity20 chair and ceo @entity285 said in a statement			2
' we chose the path of digital distribution first so as to reach as many people as possible on opening day , and we continue to seek other partners and platforms to further expand the release			0
' even more impressive however is how quickly the studio managed to pull this all together after initially deciding to hold off on distributing the film last week			0
@entity3 only announced on tuesday that the film would play in selected theaters and be released to video on demand on thursday			2
as for the big online announcement , that was confirmed less than an hour before the movie appeared on @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 and a @entity3 website created for the film , with the option of renting the film for $ 5.99 or downloading it for $ 16.99			2
there are still questions as to just who was behind the hacking as well , with many experts in the cybersecurity field questioning an @entity47 report that they say proved @entity148 's government masterminded the attack			1
the experts all firmly believe the hack had to be an inside job .			0
