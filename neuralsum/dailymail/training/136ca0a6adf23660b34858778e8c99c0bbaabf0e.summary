the childhood memory still sparks a slight shiver of discomfort even now			2
my mother and i were in a department store loos when i innocently asked about the ‘ special towels ’ in the vending machine on the wall			2
well , she ’d never moved so quickly			2
grabbing me by the arm , she dragged me out the door			2
i was left in no doubt i ’d said something very wrong — but i was totally bewildered as to what it was			0
i must have been about eight			0
i would n’t learn the truth for another four years — and , even then , the information came from school friends			0
i grew up thinking periods were shameful , dirty even			1
as did most of my generation — sadly , many girls still do			1
@entity23 with her daughter @entity22 , 19 ( left ) and daughter @entity21 , 14 ( right ) as a mother of two teenage daughters — @entity22 , 19 , and @entity21 , 14 — and a son , @entity27 , 16 , i ’d hate to think my children would ever be made to feel embarrassed about puberty like i was			1
in many tribal cultures , a first period is considered something to be celebrated : a coming of age , when a girl becomes a woman			1
sadly , although we like to think of ourselves as civilised , we could n’t have a more different approach			1
hands up those who wrinkled their noses at the very mention of the p - word ? i ’m 52 now and , all these years on , menstruation is the final taboo			0
we will talk freely about porn , boob jobs and even female genital mutilation , but periods are still what i call a ‘ silent subject ’			1
ridiculous when you consider half the population at some point experience them every month			0
and damaging , too , at a time when the age girls enter puberty continues to fall			1
most girls still start their periods when they ’re about 12 , but nowadays there are those who start as early as eight			1
so it ’s never been more important to talk openly to girls from an early age to make sure they ’re prepared			1
of course i understand it ’s hardly dinner party conversation , but we have a duty to teach our daughters — and sons , come to mention it — that there is nothing to be ashamed or afraid of			0
and that means not shying away from the matter			0
@entity23 looking glams up on @entity77 : the subject may not be glamorous , but the ' beautiful people ' have periods too many will wonder why on earth a television presenter like me is speaking out about such a deeply unglamorous issue			1
even friends have frowned : ‘ what are you talking about that for ? ’ but that ’s half the point : the ‘ beautiful people ’ have periods , too			1
in fact , it was while on holiday with my gorgeous friend , former @entity98 women ’s tennis no 1 and tv presenter @entity99 , that i first realised that it was high time the matter was dragged into the public consciousness			1
@entity99 and i had met on the tv circuit over the years , but it was through holidaying in the same place that we became friends			1
@entity99 ’s parents have a place in @entity110 near our holiday home			1
she also has two daughters and a son — @entity115 , 20 , @entity116 , 16 , and @entity117 , 18 — who get on brilliantly with my lot			0
during a holiday in 2011 , @entity99 and i went off for a day ’s shopping without kids and husbands			1
i remember picking up a multipack of knickers and she asked : ‘ what do you want those for ? ’ ‘ oh , you know , they ’re good period pants for the girls , ’ i replied			1
@entity99 ’s mouth dropped open in recognition			1
the little ‘ accidents ’ associated with menstruation are n’t something women talk about often			1
but at the mention of it , @entity99 confessed to having suffered that kind of thing from the age of 15 — to her great shame			1
that ’s when she started spending time away from home on the international tennis circuit			1
something she dreaded , simply because of her periods			1
‘ i ’d have to stay with host families , strangers , ’ she told me , ‘ and face the indignity of having to apologise for accidents during the night			1
when i spoke to my mum about it she gave me what was basically a shower cap with legs			0
it worked , but i always wondered why there ’s nothing out there for that sort of thing			0
’ she also told me that female tennis players in whites often have to leave the court during a game to go and sort themselves out			2
i ’m aware this will be too much information for some , but why should women feel ashamed of something they ca n’t help ? @entity99 and i came up with an idea : we would launch a pair of knickers that as well as looking feminine , pretty and soft to the touch , would be waterproof as well			1
female tennis players like @entity99 often have to leave the court because of their periods it was the research required before we got started that made me realise quite how many women — and young girls — suffer in silence			1
we started by talking to our daughters			0
like me , @entity22 and @entity21 have been lucky enough to escape heavy periods , but they were full of stories about friends who ’d had to dash out of class , resulting in ridicule from the boys			2
and seeing as sleepovers are the big thing these days , i recalled one or two of my daughters ’ friends who ’d scuttled off as quickly as possible the following morning — all because they were too ashamed to mention they ’d had an ‘ accident ’ in the night			0
my daughters were first taught sex education at 11 , but i ’m told the curriculum did n’t go into detail until 13 or 14			0
meanwhile , aware of my own experience of puberty being shrouded in secrecy , i was always very open — keeping things age - appropriate of course			0
they were both 13 when they started their periods — a year older than i was			2
i had stocked up on products beforehand and told them where they were kept			0
i explained that if they just wanted to help themselves that was fine , but if they wanted to talk to me that was also fine			0
i think many of us are in denial about how knowledgeable our children are these days			0
it usually takes three years for a girl to finish puberty , but anything up to six years is considered normal sadly , thanks to the prevalence of mobile phones , they are likely to know far more about things like internet porn than we do — so surely we should be able to broach the subject of something as normal as puberty without awkwardness			2
@entity99 and i devised a survey aimed at secondary school girls and circulated them at three schools — our daughters ’ schools and an all - girls ’ school round the corner from me			1
we were amazed at the results : 34 per cent said they had ‘ accidents ’ every month , but 91 per cent admitted to being so fearful of them that they avoided light clothing , would n’t sleep over and refused to do any sport during that time			2
of course , that confirmed the need for the kind of pants we intended to launch			0
but , more importantly , it highlighted the pressing need for more understanding and less squeamishness			0
as things progressed and we started to talk to more women at school fairs , ideal home shows , parenting shows etc , we heard even more startling confessions			0
a lot of women confessed to wearing two or three pairs of knickers during menstruation , but not only does that not necessarily work , it ’s pretty uncomfortable			0
some women wear two or three pairs of knickers during their period one said she had to sit in lengthy meetings with male colleagues all the time and was becoming increasingly mortified by how often she had to leave the room			2
another , in her 30s , later posted on @entity278 that our pants had literally ‘ changed her life ’ because as a sufferer of endometriosis ( a chronic condition that affects the womb and can cause heavy periods ) , she had n’t been able to hold down a job , as the bleeding was so unpredictable			2
of course , with waterproof knickers she felt so much more confident			2
i ’m lucky that my husband , @entity290 , a restaurateur , is very understanding about these things			0
since we started the project , he ’s admitted : ‘ i ’ve learned so much ! ’ he had n’t realised so many women have problems in that department			0
@entity99 and i launched diary doll knickers in october 2012			1
since then , i often have to stand up and ‘ sell ’ the concept to a very mixed audience			0
predictably enough , half the men in the room will shift awkwardly in their seats — and the other half would far rather i stick to the business details			0
but the awkwardness certainly is n’t confined to men			0
@entity306 started stocking our underwear earlier this year , and the most common question asked by staff was : ‘ how do we sell this without causing offence or embarrassment ? ’ the fact is that , even in this ‘ enlightened age ’ , many women still giggle about the matter or suggest it ’s distasteful — clearly falling in line with society ’s constrictions			2
i do n’t expect miracles but i hope that speaking publicly about the ‘ monthly misery ’ will help reduce the stigma			0
why should women feel like social pariahs about periods , the most natural thing in the world ? after all , none of us would be here without them .			2

sadly many girls still think of periods as dirty or shameful
*nowadsays* some girls start their period aged eight
@entity23 *tackled* the problem with former @entity98 tennis no.1 @entity99
waterproof underwear range stops little ' accidents '
