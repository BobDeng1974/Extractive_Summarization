by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 5 january 2013 updated : 14:45 est , 7 january 2013 a cramped flat at the top of a 31 - storey tower block might seem an undesirable prospect even for those on a lengthy council housing waiting list			1
so it seems incredible that a property matching this description is on the market for £ 375,000			1
the fact it is at the summit of the 322ft @entity14 helps explain the steep asking price			1
rising from the fashionable landscape of @entity20 ’s @entity19 , this @entity17 tower is possibly the most famous social housing block in @entity22			1
the three - bedroom flat ’s vendors , @entity25 , 50 , a former airline worker , and her husband @entity27 , 53 , a bus driver , brought up their three daughters and son in the flat , moving in as council tenants in 1995 and buying it under the right - to - buy scheme three years later			1
room with a view : @entity25 is selling her three - bedroom flat on the top floor of famous @entity19 council block @entity14 for £ 375,000 they say their children , @entity38 , 29 , @entity40 , 25 , @entity41 , 20 and @entity42 , 18 , who still lives in the 780 sq ft flat , loved growing up in the property so much they begged them not to put it on the market			1
they must have a head for heights as the flat ’s balcony , which faces south , is not for vertigo sufferers			2
‘ you see the sun rise on one side of the flat and set on the other , ’ says @entity25			2
‘ you can see as far as @entity58 and @entity59 and all the main @entity20 landmarks such as the @entity61 , the @entity62 and the @entity63			1
‘ this is a great area to live in with @entity65 on our doorstep and great schools , sports facilities , shops and hospitals nearby			0
’ @entity14 was built by the @entity73 - born modernist architect @entity72 , whose surname was borrowed by @entity76 author @entity75 for his villain in the 1959 book of the same name			1
famous flats : designed in the 1970s the @entity14 is a landmark in @entity20 top table : @entity25 in the kitchen of her three - bedroom high - rise apartment at the top of the @entity14 he saw his design as the future for modern housing			1
the tower is built in a narrow oblong with a separate lift tower linked at every third storey to the main block			0
inside , the flats were built to dovetail each other			0
where one flat had a front door at the top of a staircase leading down to the living area , next door would always have the opposite design with the front door at the base of the stairs			1
this was intended to reduce noise transmitting between the apartments			0
but by the time the block was completed in 1972 , high - rises were becoming unpopular with council tenants because they attracted crime and anti-social behaviour			2
@entity116 ’s fortunes started to rise following the formation of a residents ’ committee in the @entity120			0
a door - entry intercom system was introduced and a concierge employed			0
with security improved , and the right - to - buy scheme in place , many of the flats changed from council to private ownership			2
now 45 of the 217 flats are privately owned			0
in 1998 the tower was @entity131 listed			0
having paid £ 65,000 for the flat , after a £ 50,000 discount under right - to - buy , @entity25 has done well out of the @entity134 ’s rising popularity			1
@entity76 's villain a hero of housing : @entity138 architecht @entity72 in front of the the council housing block with the tower on the left but there is a £ 3,000 - a - year service charge and the building ’s private residents face a bill for the insulation of the roof and power - hosing the outside walls			1
this is under negotiation but stands at £ 16,000 per flat			2
@entity153 , of selling agents @entity154 , also points out that obtaining a mortgage on a flat in a high - rise is n’t straightforward			2
he says : ‘ funding can be difficult for flats in local authority high - rise tower blocks			2
but love it or hate it , @entity14 will continue to dominate the skyline over what is likely to be the trendiest area in @entity20 for many years to come			1
’ @entity25 is fast to allay fears about unreliable lifts and crime that some may have about living in a high - rise			0
‘ we have never had any problems with crime , ’ she says			0
‘ and the lifts have only broken down once in the whole time we have lived here			0
i once went through a fitness phase and ran up and down the staircase for training			0
you would n’t believe how quickly i got fit			0
