by @entity0 and @entity1 two best friends who made a drunken bet to row the @entity4 despite never having rowed before not only set a world record but have now become film stars since completing the perilous journey			1
@entity8 and @entity9 , both 32 , nearly died several times during the 116 - day trip - including having to spend five hours in shark - infested waters after their boat capsized			1
but the pair survived , and now their heroics have been dramatised in a documentary by filmmaker @entity19 , called and then we swam			1
ready to go : this still from @entity19 's film shows @entity8 ( right ) and @entity9 , both 32 , at the airport before setting off on their adventure in 2011 remember @entity26 : after spending he next seven years toiling in jobs they hated , the friends remembered @entity26 's famous words , ' always do sober what you said you 'd do drunk , ' and began raising money to buy a boat - which they did with their £ 15,000 life savings brave : the film charts the ups and downs of their 116 - day adventure that saw them lose their navigation equipment to a storm and swim in shark - infested waters after their boat capsized and then we swam : now , their heroics have been dramatised in a documentary by filmmaker @entity19 , called and then we swam they made the crazy wager as @entity56 literature students at prestigious @entity57 in 2004 , prior to graduating			1
they soon forgot the bet , spending the next seven years toiling in jobs they hated			0
but by 2010 the friends had had enough of their mundane lives and , one day , remembered @entity26 's famous words , ' always do sober what you said you 'd do drunk			0
' @entity19 said : ' it stemmed from not being happy with what we were doing			2
we were living in an awful , mouse - infested flat , i was a fully integrated accounting software salesman and had n't sold anything in the six months i had been there			1
@entity8 was doing a law course he was n't really interested in			2
' an article about @entity77 , the first person to complete a solo unassisted non-stop crossing of the @entity79 , had just come out and over red wine on a wintery sunday evening , just as the pay - as - you - go electricity was about to run out , we decided to give it a go			0
' after spending their £ 15,000 combined life savings on an ocean rowing vessel , they set out to conquer the high seas alone - almost losing their lives in the process			2
they not only succeeded in crossing the @entity4 in 116 days , but also became the first ever pair in history to row it without a support boat			1
fresh - faced : @entity9 ( left ) and @entity8 ( right ) at their graduation ball at @entity99 in 2004 , where they first discussed rowing an ocean , only for their friends to dismiss the idea as a pipe dream eight years on : @entity8 ( left ) and @entity19 ( right ) after succeeding in crossing the @entity4 after 116 days at sea			1
this was taken the night they were dramatically rescued one mile out from the @entity110 coast after a freak wave capsized their boat and dumped them in the sea for five hours as their family waited anxiously onshore what a team : the pair rowing together about two weeks into the trip judging by the length of their beards @entity4 sunset : @entity19 with his back to the setting sun as he smiles for the camera after a hard day 's rowing rough seas : @entity19 with his trusty headband on , working up a sweat on the high seas the pair lost about three stone and survived on a diet of freeze - dried food , rationed cigarettes , whisky and a sense of humour			1
their fresh water - making machine broke which meant they also had to use a hand pump for two hours a day on top of the 12 - hour shifts they each put in on the oars strong arms : james at the hand - pump			2
it took an hour to make a litre of fresh water			0
and a minute to drink @entity8 , who wrote a book about the adventure , said : ' [ my book ] rowing after the @entity159 is an account of our unsupported row across the @entity4 , a journey which fewer people have completed than have walked on the moon			1
we yearned for a big adventure and we certainly got what we asked for			0
' it 's a story of moonbows and meteor showers , passing whales and thieving fish , lurking sharks and giant squid ; it is part adventure narrative , part blue water history , part meditation on nature and part memoir			1
' despite warnings that emergency rescue teams could take up to two days to reach them , and against their better judgement , they set off from @entity183 , @entity184 in @entity185			0
for the following 116 days their home was a one ton , 26ft , self - righting ocean rowing boat , packed with 300 kilos of dry foods ( mainly curry ) , navigation equipment , a desalinator , some whisky and cigarettes ( rationed to one each a day ) , and their self - imposed limit of three books each			2
while one slept in a seven foot by four foot water - tight cabin the other rowed for two hours			1
what makes the feat even more impressive is that @entity8 , at 14 , contracted @entity205 syndrome , a debilitating illness which affects the peripheral nervous system and left him in a coma for a month , totally paralysed but conscious			2
@entity209 : the pair managed to cross the @entity4 in 116 days despite having no experience prior to their trip this was taken minutes after they were rescued from the sea			2
a helicopter had tried and failed to locate them			0
fortunately for @entity8 and @entity19 , two locals headed out on their boat to help the search party and spotted them after finding a floating oar from their wrecked boat			1
their family waiting onshore had started to fear the worst his recovery took over a year and left him with paralysed feet			0
@entity19 stood on a stonefish while growing up in @entity228 and underwent two years of operations as tropical disease doctors battled to save his leg			0
the newly - released book ' rowing after the @entity159 ' , written by rower @entity8 as the book explains , the adventure was something the pair discussed as @entity57 , with their friends dismissing it as nothing but a pipe dream			1
after graduating in @entity244 ( @entity8 ) and @entity245 ( @entity19 ) the pair lived together in a flat in @entity247 , south @entity248 and soon became unhappy with their respective jobs			1
both men contributed £ 400 a month to their boat fund , which they used to buy a £ 15,000 craft that has twice crossed the @entity254 with previous owners			0
but he journey was far from plain sailing , or rather rowing			0
just after the halfway mark a giant wave smashed down on the boat just as @entity8 was stepping out of the cabin , breaking the onboard navigation system ( gps ) and desalinator system			2
' we were forced to use a handheld gps which just gave co-ordinates but nothing else ( unlike the proper gps which showed speed and course which you can use to plot you way			0
' but dwindling batteries meant we only switched handheld on now and then and just used the compass to navigate			0
' tweets made by the pair during the journey			0
@entity279 was something they relied on to keep spirits high			0
often they would row all day only to find that the current had actually pushed them back			0
on their last day , just as they caught sight of land for the first time in 116 days and their family and friends arrived to greet them , another huge wave , this time only bigger , capsized their boat and threw them both overboard			0
@entity19 managed to rescue a flare from the boat , which he let off , only for the flare 's cap to backfire in to @entity8 ' leg			1
with blood streaming into the depths of the shark - infested water , the pair clung together for five hours until a local rescue team miraculously found them and brought them to dry land and into the arms of their parents who had all but given up hope of find them alive			1
rowing after the @entity159 : a crossing of the @entity4 by @entity316 , by @entity8 is published by @entity317 , is now on sale priced £ 12.99			1
reunited : @entity319 with wife @entity320 who had flown out to greet him			0
she brought with her boost chocolate bars , something he had craved while at sea			0
prior to setting off she had given him a packet of letters for the journey			0
he was instructed to open one every two weeks - something that kept him going when things got tough @entity19 and @entity8 with the men and their sons who decided to join the search party and who carried on looking for them even when the helicopter turned back			1
they found them after five hours bobbing in the sea - and are pictured here with the capsized boat 's oars			2
having recuperated and feasted on the food and drink they had dreamed about while out at sea , the pair pose by the boat from which they had become separated right at the very end of their epic 3,100nautical mile journey			1

and then we swam , by filmmaker @entity19 , charts @entity8 and @entity9 's *incredible* adventure
the @entity99 graduates and *contemporaries* of prince @entity358 became only pair in history to row @entity4 without a support boat in *tow*
they had three months of rowing practice on the @entity366 before setting off
fewer people have rowed the @entity4 than have walked on the moon
one mile from shore at the end of the journey a 50ft wave up - ended their boat and they spent five hours in shark - infested water before being rescued
