thankfully for the photographer , it had just gobbled up a capybara rodent and was n't interested in devouring him as a second course			0
@entity12 , a father - of - two from @entity33 , said : ' as the snake had just eaten it did n't take much interest in us			2
' everything is possible but i do n't think it would have eaten us			0
i was very close , i could have touched it if i wanted to			0
' time for your close - up : @entity12 was able to reach out and touch this massive anaconda sunbathing on the riverbank having devoured a capybara rodent he saw six different female anaconda snakes on his ten - day trip to the @entity7 do @entity23 region , right in the heart of @entity62			1
