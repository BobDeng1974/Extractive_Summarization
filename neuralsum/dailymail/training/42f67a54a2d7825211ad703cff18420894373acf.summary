new laws with echoes of @entity4 's anti-social behaviour orders will be used to bring radical preachers under control , the home secretary has revealed			1
@entity7 said @entity8 must use ' all the legal powers we need to prevail ' after @entity12 journalist @entity11 was beheaded by a masked ' @entity8 ' extremist dubbed @entity14			1
they would include new civil powers to target radical preachers whose outbursts fall short of breaking the law , and similar @entity20 - style ' banning orders ' to outlaw groups communicating extreme views			1
these are set to include civil orders for those whose activities fall short of breaking the law neither would be criminal proceedings but breaching them could be a crime			1
this aspect is similar to @entity20 , which have largely fallen out of use since they launched in 1998 amid widespread controversy			1
the laws also follow on from control orders , which were declared a breach of human rights in 2011 and turned into less stringent @entity45 and @entity46 ( @entity47 )			1
but these orders are targeted at those directly suspected of terrorism , whereas mrs may indicated the new laws would focus on those spreading or preaching extremist views			1
writing in the @entity56 , mrs may added the government was already using powers to to strip citizenship from @entity8 jihadists fighting in @entity61 and @entity63 - of which there are more than 500			0
since the coalition came to power in 2010 more than 150 people have already been excluded from @entity8 for ' unacceptable behaviour ' , including foreign hate preachers			2
horror : a still from the brutal video released by @entity71 militants who beheaded journalist @entity11 the new laws would target those who slip through the cracks between what is unacceptable and what is illegal , but this is nothing new			2
the government introduced control orders in 2005 for terror suspects who did not meet the threshold to be prosecuted , putting heavy restrictions on their freedom of movement			1
@entity86 sources argued the suspects could only not be prosecuted because the evidence against them was inadmissable in court - for example , wiretaps by security agents or sources who could not go on the record			2
nonetheless the orders were declared a breach of human rights - including the right to a fair trial - and replaced in 2011 by @entity45 and @entity46 ( @entity47 )			1
the new @entity47 meant the state had to have a ' reasonable belief ' of terrorist activity , more than the ' suspicion ' of the previous law			1
the @entity86 has not set out any more detail about the new laws , including how they would differ from their predecessors			2
but mrs may indicated they will focus more on preachers - in other words , anyone who wishes to spread extremism to others - rather than those directly planning a terror attack			1
mrs may said the powers applied to @entity8 with dual citizenship and those who have been naturalised , but not those who have life - long sole @entity8 nationality as it is illegal to make citizens ' stateless '			0
however , she insisted those jihadists would be prosecuted when they return home ' we will be engaged in this struggle for many years , probably decades ' , the home secretary wrote			0
' we must give ourselves all the legal powers we need to prevail			0
' i am looking again at the case for new banning orders for extremist groups that fall short of the legal threshold for terrorist proscription , as well as for new civil powers to target extremists who seek to radicalise others			1
' she added : ' people who insist on travelling to fight in @entity63 and @entity61 will be investigated by the police and security services			2
' for those who have dual nationality , i have the power to strip them of their citizenship and exclude them from the country			0
' following the recent @entity149 , i can , in certain circumstances , remove citizenship from naturalised @entity8 who are fighting overseas and exclude them too			0
' and while it is illegal for any country to make its citizens stateless , any @entity8 national who returns from @entity63 and @entity61 faces prosecution here for participating in terrorist activities abroad			0
' since 2010 police have secured the removal of 28,000 pieces of terrorist material from the internet , she added			0
mrs may wrote : ' the cowardly murder this week of @entity11 , a man who was working to highlight the suffering of the @entity63 people to the world , has demonstrated once again the very deadly threat we face from terrorism at home and abroad			2
' a @entity86 spokesman told @entity175 she was unable to provide any detail on the proposed new powers			0
killed : mr @entity11 ( pictured ) was abducted while reporting on @entity63 in 2012 and is believed to have died recently @entity178 , @entity4 's shadow home secretary , said : ' more action is needed to respond to the serious problem of people travelling to fight with @entity182 ( @entity182 )			2
' the home secretary 's confirmation that she is continuing to look at the recommendations of the prime minister 's @entity186 , announced last december , is welcome			0
' though there remains no detail on things like civil powers to tackle extremists or extremist groups for people to consider			1
' however i remain concerned that the government is not addressing the gaps in the @entity199 programme - especially the lack of support for community led approaches to preventing radicalisation			0
' and the home secretary also needs to respond to the concerns raised by the current and previous @entity207 about the decision to weaken control orders , where they have advised that stronger measures should be put in place			1
' @entity213 : @entity71 militants have swept through @entity61 and @entity63 , flying their flag near @entity216 ( pictured ) the government has come under pressure from @entity219 , the former head of the @entity220 , to build bridges with @entity63 president @entity222 to tackle the militants operating in @entity63 and @entity61			0
but foreign secretary @entity224 said an alliance with @entity222 would not be ' practical , sensible or helpful ' , and the government has called for @entity222 to be removed over his actions during the country 's bloody civil war			0
asked if @entity8 would have to collaborate with the @entity222 regime , mr @entity224 told @entity231 's @entity232 : ' no. we may very well find that we are fighting , on some occasions , the same people that he is but that does n't make us his ally			0

@entity7 proposes new civil laws to target radical preachers and groups
they would focus on people who do not meet threshold of breaking the law
laws *resemble* @entity20 as they could prompt criminal offence if breached
they also follow on from control orders , replaced by @entity47 in 2011
*unlike* @entity47 which focus on terror suspects , law would target *recruiters*
