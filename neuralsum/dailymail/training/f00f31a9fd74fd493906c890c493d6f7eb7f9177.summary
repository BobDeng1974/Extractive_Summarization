by @entity0 astronomers have been able to capture unprecedented images of a mysterious gas that connects galaxies throughout the universe			1
known as the intergalactic medium ( @entity8 ) , this enigmatic substance has , up until now , merely been a matter of theoretical speculation			0
but now @entity12 scientists have used the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) to obtain their first three - dimensional images of the @entity8			2
astronomers have been able to capture unprecedented images of a mysterious gas that connects galaxies throughout the universe			2
pictured is an image of quasar - a nucleus of a young galaxy - showing surrounding gas ( in blue ) and the direction of filamentary dim matter dim matter is the mysterious gas that connects galaxies throughout the universe			1
since the late 1980s and early 1990s , theoreticians have predicted that primordial gas from the @entity30 is not spread uniformly throughout space			2
instead , it distributed in channels that span galaxies and flow between them			0
this ‘ cosmic web ’ - the @entity8 - is a network of smaller and larger filaments crisscrossing one another across the vastness of space and back through time to an era when galaxies were first forming			1
of normal matter , only one - quarter is made up of stars and galaxies , the bright objects that light our night sky			2
the remainder , which amounts to only about three per cent of everything in the universe , is the @entity8			0
the images could help astronomers better understand the structure of the cosmic web that flows through the universe to understand how it affects galaxies			1
the @entity8 was imaged near two very bright objects ; a quasar – which is the nucleus of a young galaxy - called qso 1549 +19 , and something called a @entity62 alpha blob – a huge concentration of a gas			0
they found a single filament feeding into the quasar which was one million light - years long , and three filaments flowing into the @entity62 alpha blob			2
these filaments are estimated to have origins from approximately 2 billion years after the @entity30			1
the @entity13 , used on the @entity71 telescope in @entity72 , was conceived and developed by @entity12 professor of physics @entity74			2
‘ i 've been thinking about the intergalactic medium since i was a graduate student , ’ he said			0
‘ not only does it comprise most of the normal matter in the universe , it is also the medium in which galaxies form and grow			2

dim matter was imaged near two very bright objects ; a quasar ¿ which is the nucleus of a young galaxy - and something called a @entity62 alpha blob ¿ a huge concentration of a gas			1
pictured is a comparison of @entity62 alpha blob observed with @entity13 and a simulation of the cosmic web based on theoretical predictions this ‘ cosmic web ’ - the @entity8 - is a network of smaller and larger filaments crisscrossing one another across the vastness of space and back through time to an era when galaxies were first forming			1
professor @entity74 describes the diffuse gas of the @entity8 as ‘ dim matter , ’ to distinguish it from the bright matter of stars and galaxies , as well as dark matter			1
he explained that 96 per cent of the mass and energy in the universe is elusive dark energy and dark matter			0
scientists only know of it due to its effects on the remaining four per cent that we can see : normal matter			0
of this four per cent that is normal matter , only one - quarter is made up of stars and galaxies , the bright objects that light our night sky			0
earlier this year , the mysterious strands of dark matter that hide beneath the visible universe were seen for the first time			0
dark matter is considered crucial to theories explaining how the universe is expanding and how galaxies interact , but has so far eluded scientists			0
in january , astronomers produced the first direct images of a part of its network using a quasar as a ‘ flashlight ’			1
a quasar is a type of active galactic nucleus that emits intense radiation powered by a supermassive black hole at the centre of the galaxy			0
this particular quasar , located 10 billion light - years away , illuminated a vast nebula of diffuse gas to reveal the network of filaments that connect galaxies in a cosmic web			1
for years , cosmologists have been running computer simulations of the structure of the universe to develop what they refer to as the ‘ standard model of cosmology ’			1
their calculations suggest that as the universe grows , matter becomes clustered like a huge cosmic web , weaving its way into in filaments and nodes under the force of gravity			1
the results from the 10 - metre @entity182 telescope in @entity183 , were reported by scientists from the @entity185 , @entity186 and the @entity187 in @entity188			0
computer simulations suggest that matter in the universe is distributed in a ' cosmic web ' of filaments , as seen in the image above from a large - scale dark - matter simulation			1
the inset is a zoomed - in , high - resolution image of a smaller part of the cosmic web , 10 million light - years across the remainder , which amounts to only about three per cent of everything in the universe , is the @entity8			1
as the name suggests , ‘ dim matter ’ is hard to see			1
@entity204 , a former graduate student at @entity12 likens it to trying to see a complex cityscape through a few narrow slits in a wall			0
‘ all you would know is that there is some concrete , windows , metal , pavement , maybe an occasional flash of colour , ’ he said			0
‘ only by opening the slit can you see that there are buildings and skyscrapers and roads and bridges and cars and people walking the streets			0
‘ only by taking a picture can you understand how all these components fit together , and know that you are looking at a city			0
’ professor @entity74 and his team have now seen the first glimpse of the city of dim matter			1
it is not full of skyscrapers and bridges , but it is both visually and scientifically exciting			0
dim matter was seen by the @entity13 installed at the @entity237 in @entity72			1

the images were captured using the @entity13 in @entity72
they are estimated to have origins from 2 billion years after the @entity30
dim matter is part of the ‘ cosmic web ’ - a network of smaller and larger filaments crisscrossing one another across the vastness of space
substance has , up until now , been a theory on how galaxies are connected
the images could help astronomers better understand the structure of the cosmic web that flows through the universe
