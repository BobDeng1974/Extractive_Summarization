the new head of the @entity1 has admitted he has agents with a drinking problem after two were accused of crashing their car while drunk at the @entity5			1
@entity6 , newly - installed director of the agency , made the admission in a stormy session in front of @entity11 as he tried to get their approval to build a replica @entity5 for agents to practice protecting the president			1
he was told his answers were ' hogwash ' , berated for the string of failures by the @entity1 , and when he said he had to build the ' trust ' of his employees , told bluntly by @entity23 @entity22 : ' dude , you do n't have to earn their trust			1
you 're their boss ! ' @entity6 also admitted he did not know about the crash for five days , and said the two staff were still being fully paid and had not yet been disciplined , although they were on administrative rather than active duty			1
the hearing itself was to be an exploration of @entity6 's budget request for the 2016 fiscal year - including the $ 8 million he is asking for to build a scale replica @entity5			1
but ' the 800 - pound gorilla in the room , ' as @entity39 chairman rep. @entity38 said , was ' what happened the other night at the @entity5			1
on - duty officers at the scene , according to the @entity64 , wanted to arrest the agents and administer sobriety tests , but a supervisor overruled them and allowed the suspects to go home			2
worse , they appeared to have driven over a ' suspicious package ' that their fellow agents were in the process of investigating			1
@entity6 , it emerged on tuesday , was only told of the incident five days later			1
he said ' there will be accountability '			0
he promised new ' ethics training ' and said he had moved the accused officers to ' non-supervisory ' desk duty , but with ' no financial penalties ' such as a salary reduction or a suspension without pay			0
' it 's going to take time , perhaps , to change this culture , ' he said , referring to a fast - and - loose attitude inside the agency he inherited after former director @entity89 resigned last year			2
he said the @entity1 has a rule prohibiting the consumption of alcohol ' 10 hours before your duty assignment			2
' but ' we do n't have protocols for off - hours ' activities , ' he added			2
' there 's an element within our agency that does cope with stresses ... by using alcohol , ' @entity6 said , noting that the agency recently launched an initiative to address stress			1
' we 've got to find a way to help some of these people that are going toward alcohol as a coping mechanism			2
' @entity111 ? an early march off - duty party led to an incident where the agents drove through an active crime - scene investigation and crashed through a @entity5 barrier panel members were impatient when @entity6 insisted he had to wait to impose discipline until his agency 's inspector general competed its own investigation			1
@entity38 , a @entity122 @entity23 , insisted that he ' terminate ' them ' as punishment			0
... we 'll be watching			0
' ' i do n't care about the @entity128 , ' he barked			0
' @entity129 love them and good luck to them			0
' ' i 'm disappointed that you have not waged your own vigorous , tough investigation , ' @entity38 lectured him			0
' to say you 're not investigating because you want the @entity138 of the department to investigate is hogwash			2
what do you think ? ' @entity6 suggested he had to earn agents ' trust as the new director of the agency , earning a scathing response from @entity38			1
' dude , you do n't have to earn their trust			0
you 're their boss ! ' he said			0
@entity6 , visibly agitated and stammering , was easy pickings			2
' i 'm very frustrated that we did n't know about this , that i did n't know about this			0
i 'm frustrated that we ca n't act until we know all the facts , ' he said			0
' i just do n't want to act improperly too soon			0
let me say this : the president , the first lady , they 're safe			0
we 've moved these individuals to administrative positions			0
' secure ? the @entity1 has come under fire after a series of embarrassing incidents that call into question its performance protecting the @entity5 and the first famil grilled : @entity6 insisted that the allegedly drunk - driving officers have been moved to desk duty , but congressmen want them fired @entity6 's budget request included $ 8 million to build a scale model of the @entity5 in a @entity49 suburb for training purposes , in the hope that other institutional face - palm moments might not repeat themselves			1
in the last year a series of fence jumpers have made it onto @entity5 grounds , including one who breached the building itself while carrying a knife in his pocket			1
and it took the @entity1 four days to determine that a rifleman had struck the presidential residence			2
' @entity190 currently uses a rudimentary , not - to - scale simulation of the north grounds of the @entity5 , using bike barricades to act as the fencing , ' @entity6 said			1
' there are no structures , vehicle gates , lighting or other aids to enhance the training simulations			0
' the carbon copy of @entity203 's presidential mansion , if @entity11 approves , would be built in @entity204 , @entity49 , about 20 miles from the real @entity5 , on 500 acres that already serve as a @entity1 training site			1
@entity208 @entity207 rep. @entity207 suggested @entity11 will take a trust - but - verify approach to giving @entity6 what he 's asking for			1
' we 're going to provide adequate funding for your agency , ' he said			0
' but it 's going to be on a short string			0

@entity6 was quizzed by @entity11 after two allegedly drunk agents crashed through @entity5 barricades during ' suspicious package ' crisis
he admitted some agents dealt with stress by ' using alcohol ' and that he had not known about incident for days
said he had seen @entity231 *footage* of the incident - although it has not been made *public*
one congressman called his answers ' hogwash ' and another told him to get a grip on troubled agency which he is supposed to get working again
@entity6 was asking for cash to build $ 8 million replica of the @entity5 in @entity49 so agents can be trained better
