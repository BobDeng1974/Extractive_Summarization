@entity1 mp @entity0 , who is a fierce critic of @entity3 aid policy , branded the legal action as ' bizarre ' and ' ridiculous ' an @entity6 farmer has won permission to use taxpayers ’ money to sue the @entity3 government ... for sending aid to his homeland			1
the case , branded ridiculous by @entity14 , will be funded entirely by the public even though the farmer has never set foot in this country			1
the 33 - year - old @entity6 – granted anonymity to protect his family – says ministers are funding a one - party state in his country that has breached his human rights			1
he says foreign aid helped the regime inflict ‘ brutal treatment ’ on thousands of farmers driven from their land , against the @entity32 2002			1
taxpayers will pay for both the farmer ’s lawyers and a defence team from the @entity38 , in a case that could cost tens of thousands of pounds			1
this is in addition to the £ 1.3billion @entity3 has sent to @entity6 since 2010			1
the farmer lodged the court papers from @entity44 , before justice secretary @entity45 introduced rules to prevent cases being brought by those who have never set foot in the @entity3			1
the changes , which come into force next month , will mean anybody seeking legal aid in civil cases must have been resident in @entity3 for at least 12 months			1
a @entity56 source said : ‘ whatever hardships this man has faced , the idea that someone without any connection to this country can get public money to sue the @entity10 borders on the farcical			1
’ @entity1 mp @entity0 , a fierce critic of @entity3 aid policy , said the legal action was ‘ bizarre ’ , adding : ‘ this is a ridiculous case and it is ridiculous there is legal aid for it			1
’ however , he added : ‘ if money is going to a corrupt regime and somebody is pointing that out then we should be taking note of it			2
a lot of the money goes on propping up corrupt regimes			0
’ it is not clear how the farmer , a father of six identified only as o , came to bring the case			0
papers lodged earlier this year state he had to leave his family and flee to a refugee camp in @entity44 after being beaten and tortured trying to protect his land			0
the @entity3 has contributed to a £ 510million protection of @entity95 fund which has allegedly ‘ contributed ’ to the programme of displacing the farmers			2
@entity84 is not personally seeking compensation , but wants the government to change its aid policies and stop bankrolling brutal regimes			2
if he succeeds , ministers could be forced to review donations to other nations accused of atrocities , such as @entity107 and @entity108			0
@entity109 has earned vast sums in legal aid by bringing cases against the government on behalf of overseas clients			2
last year the firm won compensation worth almost £ 20million for 5,200 @entity44 who were tortured and abused during the @entity116 in the @entity117 and @entity118			0
it is also heavily involved in the @entity120 , examining claims that troops executed and tortured @entity123 at a camp near @entity125 in 2004			0
the hearings have already cost taxpayers £ 27million , despite evidence linking the men to a ‘ terrorist organisation ’			0
@entity6 is @entity131 ’s oldest independent country			2
apart from a five - year occupation by @entity134 , it has never been colonised			0
drought , war and famine brought millions to the brink of starvation in the @entity140			0
this inspired rock stars to launch @entity143			0
now led by the @entity146 , its economy has grown rapidly since civil war ended in 1993			0
however , it is still one of @entity131 ’s poorest states , with its population of 86.5million earning an average of just £ 240 a year			0
@entity84 is being represented by @entity154 of @entity109			0
her law firm has already brought a string of human rights - based legal aid cases against the @entity159 on behalf of overseas claimants who say they have suffered ill - treatment due to government policies			1
ministers had urged the @entity164 to reject the latest claim , but mr @entity166 said yesterday it was ‘ reasonable ’ for o to believe there was a link between the @entity171 aid to @entity6 and alleged human rights abuses			2
he said o may launch a judicial review to argue the department had ‘ failed to have in place any sufficient process to assess @entity6 ’s compliance with the express conditions for receiving @entity3 aid – or to follow such process ’			1
international development secretary @entity182 , who is named as the respondent on the court papers , denies the claims			2
a department spokesman said : ‘ the @entity3 has never funded @entity6 ’s resettlement programmes			1
our support to the @entity190 is only used to provide essential services like healthcare , schooling and clean water			0

@entity6 man launches taxpayer funded legal action against @entity3 government despite never having set foot in the country
@entity203 claims ministers are funding a one - party state in his homeland that has helped regime inflict ' brutal treatment ' on thousands
taxpayers will pay for both the farmer *'s* lawyers and a defence team from the @entity38
