by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 12:40 am on 23rd february 2012 the @entity2 had been raging for more than two years , with rationing in force and mounting fears of a @entity7 blockade			2
faced with the prospect of food supplies being cut off , a pair of eminent scientists came up with a solution : let them eat plankton			1
they planned to harvest tons of the microscopic creatures from @entity19 lochs			1
secret wartime letters just uncovered reveal that professor @entity21 , a marine biologist at @entity22 , told colleagues that plankton – the term for a range of drifting organisms found in fresh and sea water – were high in protein and could be ‘ tasty ’			1
plans were drawn up to harvest the microscopic sea creatures to sustain @entity32 if food supplies were cut off during @entity2			1

sketch of net proposed for full - scale collection of plankton			1
a is a rope net used to to enable rope b to be pulled inside out			0
a continuous cable ( left ) is used to lower or raise the nets to the desired depth			1
to the right is the line , attached to cork , for hauling up the catch the idea was to capture tons of copepods - which the scholars described as ' tasty ' - in the tidal areas of sea lochs along the west coast of @entity19 he convinced sir @entity57 , an mp and regius professor of biology at @entity60 , and they calculated that ten nets could catch enough plankton in 12 hours to feed 357 people			1
in 1941 sir @entity57 wrote to @entity66 , director of the @entity67 , who appears to have been sceptical : ‘ it is simply silly to brush the matter aside as of no importance , when one remembers the sea off our coasts is often soup - like in its richness with nutritive material			1
the boffins calculated that nets anchored in @entity80 would cost £ 90,000 and would catch over 26 tons of plankton each day			1
the loch is seen here in 1933 the academics made diagrams of nets , explored areas on the west coast of @entity19 where it could work and even carried out trials from 1941 - 43 to see if it was possible ‘ no doubt you have tested for yourself the tastiness of some types of plankton			1
’ scientists reckoned that nets anchored in @entity80 would cost £ 90,000 and would catch over 26 tons of plankton each day			1
@entity21 proposed : ' the plankton would be emptied into containers and conveyed to the nearest pier where it would stand ready to be conveyed by lorry or motor boat to the drying plant			1
' simple drying plants would be set up at convenient points along the coast and the resulting dry plankton dispatched in sacks to a headquarters factory for testing , sorting , mixing and final preparation into meal ... ' the anchoring and inspection of nets would be done by motor boats which could also be continually cruising the area investigating the richest regions of plankton			1
' trials went ahead in 1941 , 1942 and 1943 but it was found that the season was too short for the scheme to work			0
by 1942 the first stockpiles had been harvested , but the plankton proved trickier to catch than the scientists expected , and the project was quietly abandoned			1
the letters were found by @entity129 , emeritus professor in marine biology at the @entity131 , in the @entity67 ’s archive			0
he said : ‘ i know of only one person who has tried plankton and he found it rather fishy and gritty			1
‘ he was n’t terribly impressed , but i suppose it would depend on how hungry you were			0
’ @entity139 of the @entity140 , the author of a book about plankton called @entity143 – a secret world beneath the @entity145 , said the idea of eating plankton is not so bizarre			2
copepods are known as ' the insects of the sea ' due to their large numbers			1
there are believed to be around 10,000 different species			0
found in fresh and salt water , they measure no more than a few millimetres long			0
one species , found in the cold waters off the @entity32 , is the calanus			0
during winter , it hibernates at a depth of 1,000m to avoid predators - and builds up lipid ( fatty ) stores in the process			0
the largest is the @entity166 , which lives on the finback whale and can grow to over a foot long			0
copepods are crustaceans - and the largest source of protein in the ocean			2
they have two antenna , a shell and segmented bodies and graze on phytoplankton and zooplankton			0
he added : ‘ the @entity181 had similar plans during the war , and there are still people trying to do this today			2
’ prof @entity129 , who is also president of the @entity187 , said he was not surprised at what he found			0
he said : ' marine biologists come up with a lot of strange ideas			0
but this scheme was not that odd - there are fisheries for various plankton in @entity196 and @entity197			2
' i 've been interested for many years in the history of marine biology and for the last ten years have been delving into all sorts of historic marine biology archives			2
' when i found these letters , i thought i would write them up as an academic paper			0
' sir @entity21 thought it was a way he could contribute to the war effort , because he was n't in the forces himself			0
' there was plenty of plankton around , but there was the question of how easy it would be to catch			1
you would need a very large net with a very small mesh			0
war - time rations in 1944			0
@entity219 was suggested as a back - up food resource a fish queue in @entity222 , west @entity223 in 1945 some societies eat plankton directly			1
the @entity196 dish @entity227 is made from krill , a shrimp - like plankton ' there would be the problem of the pressure of the water trying to push through a net , which would become clogged up with debris - not to mention basking sharks			2
' i only know of one person who has tried plankton and he found it rather fishy and gritty			2
unlike a prawn , which you can peel , the exoskeleton was still intact			0
' he was n't terribly impressed , but i suppose it would depend on how hungry you were			0
' and i expect it was intended that the plankton would have been added to other foods rather than eaten on its own			2

plan to catch tons of copepods in sea lochs along @entity19 west coast
boffins calculated ten , 30sq m nets could in 12 hours catch enough plankton to feed 357 people
academics *corresponded* : ' @entity264 you have tested for yourself the tastiness of some types of plankton '
