' i repeatedly dove down and managed to free the snake from the intertwined coral head he had taken refuge in and managed to do it without being bitten			2
' my approach to life and wildlife is always very hands on , so when i see something new and unusual , my first instinct is always to go catch it and have a look			0
@entity6 dove down and managed to free the snake from the intertwined coral head he had taken refuge in ' what was really amazing and surprising was the abundance of really big banded sea kraits in @entity8			1
