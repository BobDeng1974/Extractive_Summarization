raised levels of a chemical linked to cancer have been found in a range of foods from @entity6 meals to breakfast cereals			1
food watchdogs identified the increased quantities of acrylamide in 14 popular products			1
the chemical is formed when foods are roasted , toasted or fried at very high temperatures			0
worrying : the foods with raised levels of the cancer risk chemical acrylamide scientists say it is potentially carcinogenic if consumed regularly over a lifetime			1
the @entity21 tested 300 products to understand the scale of the problem			0
the largest amount was found in crisps , including a number of expensive brands such as @entity30 crisps			1
exposure : the largest amount of the chemical was found in crisps , such as @entity35 's @entity30 there were also raised levels in @entity39 ready salted crisps , @entity41 cheese and onion crisps , @entity44 crisps , @entity47 @entity46 sea salt crisps and the co-op ’s @entity49 and @entity50 crisps			1
manufacturers suggested the problem was caused by last year ’s bad weather which changed sugar levels in potatoes , which in turn created more acrylamide			1
in terms of take - out food , raised levels were found in a sample of @entity6 fries bought at a restaurant in @entity65 , @entity66 , and a fish and chip shop in the town			2
breakfast cereals containing bran , which is cooked at a particularly high temperature , also contained more acrylamide			0
raised levels were found in @entity39 bran flakes , @entity76 ’s wholegrain bran flakes , the co-op ’s wheat bran flakes and puffed wheat sold by the @entity80			1
higher than expected levels were also found in @entity83 ’s @entity82 and @entity85 biscuits			1
the @entity21 stresses it does not consider the levels of the chemical found to be dangerous , however it is keen that they are brought down as a precautionary measure			1
a spokesman said : ‘ we will work with the relevant local authority to encourage food manufacturers to review their acrylamide reduction strategies			0
’ the watchdog said there is no need for the public to give up the foods named in its survey , however it gave advice on how people can reduce exposure			0
this includes cooking chips only to a light golden colour while advising that ‘ bread should be toasted to the lightest colour acceptable ’			0
danger : the chemical is formed when foods are roasted , toasted or fried at very high temperatures as in @entity85 @entity116 biscuits it said manufacturers ’ instructions for frying or oven - heating foods , such as chips , should be followed carefully			2
the @entity21 also tested the products for the presence of a second type of cancer risk chemical called furan			0
no official safety limit exists for the chemical , however higher levels were found in roast coffee and popcorn			2
@entity6 said it has contacted all of its outlets to ensure cooking methods are designed to guarantee low acrylamide levels			2
it added : ‘ we believe that this was a one – off anomalous result as the levels in every other test carried out on @entity6 fries were significantly lower			0
’ @entity143 ’s said the wet weather had changed the character of potatoes to create higher levels of the unwanted chemical			2
as a result , it is switching to new varieties that should reduce the level and is improving its sorting process to remove overcooked crisps			0
@entity39 said : ‘ food safety is incredibly important to us , and we are working closely with our suppliers to ensure all acrylamide levels are below the recommended indicative value			0
