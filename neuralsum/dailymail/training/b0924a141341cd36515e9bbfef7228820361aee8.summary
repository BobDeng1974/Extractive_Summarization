by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:47 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 18:16 est , 20 august 2013 there was once a time when this alley stank of rotten rubbish and was ruled by rats			2
now it 's a fragrant oasis of calm where residents , young and old love to spend their time			2
the transformation is all down to grandmother @entity13 , who grew so tired of seeing litter and vermin behind her home that she rallied her neighbours to help her do something about it			1
together they spent eight years turning the passageway into an amazing garden of hanging baskets , passion flowers and conifers			1
tomatoes , apples and pears are just some of the produce now grown there			1
mrs @entity13 , 75 , has lived in her terraced house on the road for more than 50 years , and says in the 1960s the alley was well - kept			1
but as the decades dragged on residents began to dump their rubbish on the cobbles , regardless of whether it was collection day or not			1
the result was a ‘ grubby ’ and ‘ dirty ’ back alley which was unsafe for children and a magnet for anti-social behaviour and crime			0
but after the neighbourhood trust erected gates at both ends of the street as part of a pilot scheme to reduce burglary , mrs @entity13 came up with an idea			1
she said : ‘ i just started thinking about how lovely the alley could be			0
for years it had been the place where people dumped their rubbish			2
rundown : neighbouring alleys such as this one in @entity34 , @entity35 , are still scruffy			1
this is only a few streets away from the beautiful back alley garden pretty : over the years , more people have become involved , maintaining the plants and adding new ones all the time , so that it has become the oasis it is today keeping up appearances : tomatoes , apples , pears and potatoes are just some of the fruit and vegetables grown in the abundant alley proud : @entity13 is one of the community members who have turned their old @entity119 terraced street 's back alley into a city oasis in a corner of @entity34 well - kept : mrs @entity13 , who used to work as a school meals assistant and now lives with her partner , has been ultimately responsible for the garden for years ‘ it was grubby , dirty and bleak , but after the gates went up i realised it did n’t have to be like that			1
@entity34 ranked as the third worst area for child poverty in a february survey by @entity133			1
the figure was at 37 per cent last year , rising from 34 per cent in 2011			0
the average house price is £ 109,851 and its unemployment rate is 7.7 per cent			0
but the council 's regeneration team is working on a number of projects to improve areas of the area and the local standard of housing			0
this includes a revamp of the @entity148 area , which is home to @entity150 and many of the town 's creative businesses			0
' i was given a grant to completely transform the alley			0
over the years , as the flowers and trees have blossomed it has become more and more lovely			2
’ in 2005 mrs @entity13 received £ 6,800 to create the haven of flowers , plants and trees and rallied other residents to help with the dramatic make - over			1

tomatoes , apples , pears and potatoes are just some of the fruit and vegetables grown in the abundant alley			1
mrs @entity13 , who is expecting a great - grandchild , added : ‘ the area has never looked so beautiful			1
' we have had such a warm , sunny summer that residents have been sitting out almost every evening enjoying a drink or some food			2
' it ’s great for children , and we get a lot of visiting youngsters to the alley			0
my kids used to play on the cobbles in the 1960s			2
' this would have been perfect for them			0
my grandchildren are adults now , but i am hoping my great grandchild will enjoy the alley when she is a bit older			0
’ popular attraction : grandmother mrs @entity13 has lived in her terraced house on the road for more than 50 years changed : the 19th century cobbled alleyway in @entity34 was once a dark , dirty lane until mrs @entity13 decided to hang flower baskets and potted plants depressed : this is the more familiar face of an area of @entity34 , @entity35 , that has become mired in deprivation and despair in recent years eyesore : just around the corner from this view of @entity34 , one single street has come together to create an astonishing lush green oasis deprived : @entity34 ranked as the third worst area for child poverty in a february survey by @entity133			1
the figure was at 37 per cent last year the widow , who used to work as a school meals assistant and now lives with her partner , has been ultimately responsible for the garden for years			0
but now she is older she has enlisted the help of neighbour @entity224 , who became more involved when he was made redundant five years ago			0
she said : ‘ @entity224 has been great , and the alley has come on in leaps and bounds since he began working with me			2
‘ it ’s a great thing for the community in general , and it has really brought people together			0
‘ and it ’s now unthinkable for anybody to dump their rubbish on the cobbles			1
residents have come to really care about the alley			0

once - dingy lane in @entity34 now haven of hanging baskets , trellises and trees with apples and pears
@entity13 has helped turn lane into a wonderland , while neighbouring alleys are still scruffy and rundown
@entity253 was well - kept in 1960s but as the decades dragged on residents began to dump their rubbish on cobbles
