the deep red wine in my glass was tempting me			1
but this time i did n't just say ' cheers ! ' and take a sip , swiftly followed by another			2
four words from @entity8 , master of wine - best known for pairing wine with food on the tv show @entity12 , were ringing in my ears … ' stop			2
' the previous evening , @entity8 had given an entertaining and informative talk on how to enjoy wine at its best			2
now here i was , at the end of a tour of the vineyards and cellars of family - owned @entity22 , using my new knowledge on a splash of @entity26 , a @entity27 , admiring its legs , swirling , sniffing , swilling to discover fruit , spices , mineral and floral notes			2
bigger , better , faster , more : @entity33 has just launched a new fleet of river cruisers , serving several countries @entity8 and i were aboard @entity37 for a few days , taking a taster of @entity33 's new heart of @entity40 cruises , which sail from the city on one - week itineraries on the @entity45 estuary and @entity47 and @entity48 rivers			1
two days before our trip , @entity8 had helped set a new @entity51 for the most ships inaugurated within 24 hours by one company , when she became godmother to @entity55 ( named after the @entity57 guardian of the gods ) in a triple christening in @entity60 on the @entity61			1
the day before , @entity62 off judge @entity63 had swung the champagne to christen @entity65 ( a mythological @entity57 horse ) in a ceremony in @entity68 during which nine new ships were named			1
with four more half - built ships christened via satellite in a shipyard in @entity75 , the number of new vessels totalled 16			1
and by the end of the same week yet two more viking ships , @entity77 and @entity78 , were launched in @entity80 , @entity81 , to sail on the @entity82			1
although @entity33 's presence on the rivers of @entity86 has rocketed , cruises for 2014 are almost sold out , mostly to @entity88 visitors			1
and @entity33 are n't stopping there - their first ocean ship , @entity91 , sets sail next year			1
the new ' longships ' with their difficult names ( such as @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 ) sailing on the rivers of @entity98 , the @entity99 and @entity100 are all very similar			1
they all have tasteful , understated @entity103 - style decor using natural fabrics and wood finishes			2
there is a choice of four cabin styles - mine was an airy two - room suite with a full balcony in the sitting room and a @entity98 balcony in the bedroom - but no pools , gyms , beauty salons or bicycles			2
the emphasis is on going ashore , and the food and wine			0
rather than safe , international fare , as i had expected , i was delighted to find @entity98 dishes , such as soupe de poisson and boeuf bourguignon on the menu , served with @entity40 wines ( drinks with meals are included in the fare ) and regional specialities such as local cheeses and pastries			0
duck and sturgeon , smoked on board , were some of the adventurous appetisers			0
on shore , we had time to take escorted tours and explore on our own			0
i enjoyed a walking tour of @entity143 down a steep street cobbled with pebbles from the beaches of @entity147			0
they had been picked up and transported here in the @entity150 as ballast by ships returning to @entity98 after trading wine			1
raising a glass : @entity155 learned how to taste , test and savour a fine drop of wine on her latest river cruise i visited the eerie and unusual monolithic church , carved out of a cliff by a returning crusader , and tasted local macaroons - not the brightly coloured type stuck together with goo that are so popular now , but delicious brown , chewy ones , similar to the traditional ones at home			1
one day there was an option ( for an extra charge of £ 145 ) to join a whole - day excursion to @entity172 , to tour a historic distillery , blend our own brandy and take the unique bottle home in a handsome wooden box			0
just the thought of brandy mixed by me gave me a hangover , so instead i spent a pleasant morning on board cruising from @entity40 up the estuary to @entity183 on the right bank			0
@entity183 , i discovered , is a small town with a big citadel , commissioned by @entity187 to protect @entity40 from the @entity188			0
tucked inside its great walls is a tiny village , with craft shops , restaurants and a wine cellar in the quaint buildings			0
grassy lawns scattered with daisies were strewn with children , taking a break from their clip boards on a history field trip			0
from the ramparts i had sweeping views of the estuary and the impressive form of @entity37 moored below , waiting to take us back to @entity40			0
@entity207 ( www.vikingcruises.co.uk , 0800 319 6660 ) offers an eight - day heart of @entity40 river cruise from £ 1,545 in 2015 if you book by the end of the month			1
this includes return flights , full - board accommodation with wine , beer and soft drinks , and five guided tours .			0
