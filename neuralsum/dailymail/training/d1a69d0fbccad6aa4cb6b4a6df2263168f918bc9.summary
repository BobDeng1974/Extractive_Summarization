by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ as @entity3 arrives at @entity6 's @entity5 training ground on wednesday morning , he will do so in the knowledge that he has just 31 days to repair the damage done by the @entity10 era before @entity11 arrive at @entity12 to kick off the @entity14 season			1
the @entity15 has already spoken of his desire to restore unity and togetherness into @entity6 's dna			2
his @entity21 side at the @entity22 was characterised as much by its defiant team spirit as it was by the flair of @entity25 and @entity26			0
' i hope the group in @entity30 will become like this one , ' @entity27 said last weekend			2
@entity21 's determined @entity22 campaign was two years in the making			0
history suggests that @entity27 's methods are ultimately successful but they can take time to come into fruition			2
united supporters expecting a blockbuster beginning may be initially underwhelmed			0
a @entity49 study into @entity27 's last 17 years in club management offers a revealing insight			2
more often than not , his teams start slowly			2
the @entity15 took over at @entity53 in the summer of 2009			0
after 13 matches , @entity27 had won just five and his team were seventh towards the end of november			1
they failed to win their first three @entity59 group stage matches			0
by may , however , @entity53 had discovered their form , winning the @entity61 and reaching the @entity59 final , where @entity27 was defeated by @entity64 's @entity63			1
timid starts are a surprising feature on @entity27 's @entity67 , a similarity @entity6 fans may note between their new manager and his illustrious predecessor sir @entity70			1
stepping in : assistant manager @entity32 has been leading @entity6 's double sessions this week @entity72 ca n't wait to get started at @entity15 side @entity73 , @entity27 achieved the improbable by seeing off the usual contenders in @entity75 and @entity76 to win the @entity77 in 2009			1
that triumph , however , followed consecutive defeats at the beginning of the season by @entity82 and @entity83			0
after 11 matches , @entity73 were fourth			0
even though his period in charge of @entity75 ( 1991 - 97 ) produced one of the most celebrated sides in the history of the @entity93 game , it should be remembered that @entity27 required three seasons to win his first @entity96 title with the @entity15 club			1
his first season in @entity99 was a success on the spreadsheet , winning the league after an impressive start , with @entity105 second after 14 games , but his style was greeted with dismay by the locals			1
short stay : @entity27 lasted less than two years at @entity53 despite winning the @entity61 against the odds : @entity27 issues instructions while at @entity73 , where he won the @entity77 in 2009 writing in his book , @entity105 : a @entity115 , author @entity114 recorded the feelings of supporters towards the end of his first season : ' the jury is out on @entity27 , a @entity15 lacking the humanity of @entity122 and the popularity of @entity124 , both of whose heads have rolled in the space of less than two years			1
' @entity105 may be at the top of the league , but the fans are unconvinced			2
they have watched the team pathetically founder in @entity93 , while continuing to play lacklustre football in the @entity14 , winning seemingly by default rather than design			0
' divisive : @entity27 was not always popular at @entity105 despite delivering two titles protests : @entity105 fans show their feelings towards @entity27 at the @entity140 in 2000 the @entity142 title was sealed in 1998 and 1999 , but once again teething problems caused near jaw - ache among the supporters			1
in december , @entity27 's side were 10th after 14 games , having won only five			1
they would go on to win 19 of their next 24 , winning the title once more			0
it is a familiar narrative with the man they call the @entity154 for his robust exterior and extraordinary levels of self - confidence			0
it is this self - belief that allows @entity27 to persist when all around the club will criticise			2
his style does not appeal to everywhere , once triggering @entity53 president @entity160 to dismissively note : ' @entity3 's problem is not that he is @entity162 but he 's @entity162 's very own father			0
@entity163 was already there before the world even existed			0
' my way or the highway : the @entity15 is expected to lay down the law at @entity6 at @entity6 , senior officials are excited by @entity27 's bravado			1
following the crisis of conviction suffered by @entity10 , they believe that the @entity15 will bring a welcome change in attitude and results			0
@entity6 may be correct on both counts , but if history proves an accurate barometer , then a little bit of patience may be required before the silverware arrives			0

@entity27 starts work as @entity6 manager this week
@entity6 had a *disastrous* 2013 - 14 season , finishing seventh in the league
@entity27 has won league titles at all four clubs he has managed ( @entity75 , @entity105 , @entity73 , @entity53 )
but his teams *traditionally* start the season slowly
