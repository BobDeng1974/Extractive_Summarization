six days after her consultation the shop assistant 's condition deteriorated ' drastically ' and she was admitted to @entity29 at the @entity30 , struggling to breathe			2
miss @entity1 was assessed and rushed to intensive care			1

she spent three weeks fighting for her life , before being airlifted back to @entity21			2
she passed away shortly after being admitted at the @entity42			0
an inquest into her death heard the gp who treated miss @entity1 did not suspect she had swine flu because doctors had been given no direction to screen patients for a possible strain of the illness			1
five months prior to miss @entity1 's death on january , 17 2011 , the @entity53 declared the notorious 2009 swine flu pandemic officially over			1
but a week after her death , gps were ordered to screen for the disease once more			2
the @entity21 hearing was told the tragedy occurred after @entity60 , from @entity20 , complaining of feeling unwell			2
she rang the @entity62 service and was questioned by a trained call handler before speaking to a nurse			2
she then had a 16 - minute consultation as part of the three - stage service with dr @entity68 at the medical centre on december 7 , 2010			1
the mother - of - one called the out - of - hours gp service in @entity20 in december 2010 , complaining of a severe cough , aches and pains and bouts of sickness four months before miss @entity1 complained of feeling unwell , the @entity53 declared the 2009 swine flu pandemic over giving evidence at the hearing dr @entity80 said ' her symptoms included aching all over , back pain and vomiting			1
she had a slight ear ache , sharp pains and pains in muscles and she said the coughing hurt			2
' i listened for any sounds on the chest and i listened to the heart as some conditions target it			0
there was air entry on both sets of lungs			0
' she did not have a wheeze but signs of a chest infection			0
there were no signs of shallow breathing and there was no indication she had major breathing difficulty			0
i diagnosed her with @entity111			0
' i believed she had a chest infection			0
this was the same diagnosis given by the doctor she spoke to over the phone			0
' dr @entity80 prescribed amoxicillin and a painkiller to help her temperature and advised to see her gp within 48 hours if her condition failed to improve			1
the hearing was told patients visiting the @entity62 to do service are diagnosed as ‘ urgent ’ and ‘ routine ’ cases			1
miss @entity1 's case had been triaged as ' urgent ' after she spoke to a call handler and nurse , before being seen by a doctor			2
after her consultation dr @entity80 downgraded her condition to ' routine '			1
the hearing heard patients suffering asthma are considered to be in an ' at risk ' group , who can be prescribed anti-flu medication @entity139 , by @entity141 outside of a designated flu epidemic			2
when questioned by assistant coroner @entity143 , as to whether miss @entity1 should have been treated as an ' at risk ' patient , dr @entity80 said : ' in terms of a chest infection , no. ' there was a question of an asthma diagnosis but i did not feel she was an acute asthmatic			1
' mr @entity143 asked dr @entity80 : ' one of the main issues is the emphasis made to @entity1 about how important her state of health was at the time			1
did you think she had got @entity159 ? ” dr @entity80 replied : ' no. it was before we were directed as @entity141 to look for swine flu , which was a week later			1
' earlier miss @entity1 ’s stepmother @entity164 , 75 , told the @entity21 hearing : ' @entity1 used to walk everywhere , she was quite fit but she was a bit down at the time			2
the 31 - year - old was seen by an out - of - hours gp , who prescribed her antibiotics and downgraded the her condition from urgent to routine			1
she died six weeks later at the @entity42 hospital swine flu is a relatively new strain of influenza that was responsible for a flu pandemic from 2009 to 2010			1
it is also known as the @entity36 influenza , denoting the strain of the virus			0
on august 10 , 2010 , the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) declared that the swine flu pandemic was officially over			1
swine flu was one of the main viruses prevalent in recent winters and as a result it was included in the 2012 - 13 seasonal flu vaccine			1
people suffering swine flu typically complain of a fever or high temperature - over @entity192			1
other symptoms include aching muscles , sore throat or a dry cough - symptoms that are very similar to other types of seasonal flu			2
for those in high - risk groups experts advise getting vaccinated against swine flu			1
those considered ' at risk ' are pregnant women , people suffering chronic , long - term lung , heart , kidney or liver disease , people suffering conditions including cystic fibrosis and @entity211 's and diabetes			2
people aged 65 or over are also considered to be at high risk of catching the strain			0
most people diagnosed with swine flu recover within around one week , even without specialist treatment			1
in 2009 swine flu spread rapidly across the world , promoting health bodies to announce a pandemic			1
the virus was first detected in @entity224 in april 2009 , but spread quickly from country to country due to it being a new strain			0
as a result very few people had a natural resistance to the virus			0
the 2009 pandemic was not as serious as it was first predicted to be , and relatively few people lost their lives as a result			2
if you suspect you have swine flu , you should contact your gp in the first instance			1

' we were just told she had an infection but we first realised she was very poorly when we got a phone call from her saying she was going to @entity29			0
' miss @entity1 was admitted into hospital on december 13 , where her condition began gradually deteriorating			2
her step - mother added : ' when we went there she was in a mask			2
' we were told initially that she had got pneumonia but later we were told it was swine flu			1
' she was in the intensive care unit at @entity256 before being transferred to @entity257 in @entity40			1
' @entity259 ’s her mum spent time with her			0
we rang three times a day to make sure she was okay			0
' we spoke to the nursing staff on the ward but just her mum went to see her			0
we were told she had got to the stage where theycould transfer her back to @entity21			0
' it was a shock to know she was coming home so soon			0
there was no discussion about the reason why she was being transferred			0
we assumed it was because it was quite expensive treatment			0
' we went down to see her at around 5pm			0
we were told she had arrived at 3pm into the @entity272 ( @entity272 )			0
we saw her at 7.30pm			0
she was comatose at this point			0
' at first a doctor had come to see us while we were waiting to see her and i felt elated			0
' he said she would be okay , she would be fine			0
the information we were given then was very positive			0
