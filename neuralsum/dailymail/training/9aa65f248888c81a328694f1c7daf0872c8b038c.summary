being prime minister does not mean @entity1 can avoid the trials and tribulations of being a parent			1
in an interview with @entity6 , he revealed details of a dash to @entity9 when his son @entity10 was stung on the foot 60 times after standing on a wasps ' nest			1
and he explained how , like millions of other parents , he is forced to listen to @entity16 hit ' @entity17 ' again and again			2
@entity1 revealed how he rushed his son @entity10 to hospital after he stood on a wasps ' nest while out with his mother @entity20 running the country comes with enormous pressures , though @entity1 does at least get to live above the shop , in his @entity23 flat			1
but being prime minister does not mean that normal family life does not go on , including moments of crisis			2
the @entity30 is set to dominate the election campaign whether the @entity32 like it or not			0
@entity33 has made clear the health service will be a key weapon in its attacks on the government			0
but there is always the danger that as prime minister he only gets to see the best hospitals , smartened up for a vip visit			2
@entity6 reader , @entity44 from @entity45 , asked : ’ when was the last time you accessed @entity30 care without prior warning , so that managers had no time to bring in more staff , paint the walls , hide patients and sycophantically pretend that the @entity30 is thriving under your watch ? ’ the prime minister also told @entity6 's political editor @entity57 that he had been forced to listen to @entity16 hit ' @entity17 ' repeatedly mr @entity1 revealed the moment one sunday afternoon last year when @entity10 and @entity20 were badly stung on the feet			1
in keeping with the government ’s official advice , he called the 111 helping - blamed for sending too many people to @entity9 - and was , unsurprisingly , told to go to @entity9			1
mr @entity1 said : ’ my son stood on a wasps ' nest in @entity67 and i rang 111 as you should , gave all the details			1
they advised me to go to @entity9 in case he got anaphylactic shock			1
the family went to the @entity74 which serves his @entity76 constituency in @entity67 , where their care was ' very good '			2
but he admits ' it was n't a particularly busy time of day being a sunday afternoon ’ , in contrast to the long waits thousands of patients have experienced this winter			1
@entity30 staff gave ' brilliant advice ' because young @entity10 was ' in a lot of pain , poor thing '			1
mr @entity1 added : ' he had been stung 60 times			1
@entity20 stepped on it too , so she had been stung too			1
' but he was very brave but they were very good , very reassuring			0
there 's been quite a lot of changes at the @entity96 actually			2
the @entity9 is in good shape			1
' even being prime minister does not give him the power to stop another rendition of songs from @entity16 film , @entity104 , he revealed today in 2013 , the @entity106 ' daughter @entity105 was rushed to hospital after getting a sticker stuck up her nose			1
a year earlier , the prime minister was mocked after leaving his older daughter @entity110 in a pub in @entity112			0
away from medical emergencies , mr @entity1 has to balance parenting with running the country			1
but even being prime minister does not give him the power to stop another rendition of songs from @entity16 film , @entity104			0
asked if he is a @entity104 fan , he replies wearily : ' i have no choice			0
' his youngest daughter @entity105 , aged four , ' of course is @entity123 ' , he says			1
his security detail also have to put up with the songs on loop when travelling with the family			2
' @entity105 has got an @entity123 dress with all the trimmings and regularly launches into song			1
' but he pre-empts the looming challenge to prove his knowledge of @entity123 , @entity134 and @entity135 : ' i do n't know all the words but i have listened to it being sung more times than i care to remember			1
' but i wo n't either give you do you want to build a @entity141 or @entity17			0
' from @entity143 and @entity144 to @entity146 ’s hair , these are the really important questions @entity6 readers wanted answered			0
and after five years in coalition with the @entity149 , is @entity150 still his favourite political joke ? @entity1 revealed he is a fan of both @entity152 ( left ) and @entity144 ( right ) @entity152 or @entity144 ? ' both			2
i ’m a big @entity153 man			0
' if you were any character from @entity144 , which would you like to be ? ' i think you do n't want to answer the question is the right answer			0
i think @entity159 said he is @entity160 and i think i 'll let him play that part			0
' @entity162 or @entity163 ? ' more @entity164			0
i 'm loving it , i think it 's very very good			0
’ what do you think of @entity146 ’s hair ? ' it 's a work of art and should be preserved for the nation			2
’ @entity173 or @entity174 ( where wife @entity20 works ) ? ' that 's an impossible question and one that could lead to all sorts of ... it depends what i 'm buying			1
' the prime minister revealed he would be ' delighted ' to join @entity143 's @entity182 and @entity183 for an evening of drinking after admitting to being a fan of the show @entity187 or @entity143 ? ' i do think @entity143 is extraordinarily insightful and i think if politicians want to understand how we are viewed at home it 's quite recommended viewing			0
’ would you have a night on the booze with @entity183 and @entity194 , as @entity195 did ? ' i would be delighted			0
they look like a really charming couple			0
' ' someone said to me , you must watch it because it 's very interesting when they watch the news			0
' so i watched five minutes and i was hooked , it 's completely brilliant			0
what - or who - is now your favourite political joke ? presumably you ca n't say @entity150 any more ... or maybe you can ? ' who or what is my favourite political joke ? i think today it is my good friend @entity210			0
’ the shadow chancellor floundered on @entity212 this week when he forgot the name of a @entity33 supporting businessman named ’ @entity215 ’			0
mr @entity1 joked in the @entity216 yesterday : ’ @entity217 is not a person , @entity215 somebody is @entity33 ’s policy			1
the @entity221 said today : ’ i think @entity217 , which i did n't think of , i will credit the hardworking researcher @entity224 with the authorship of this joke , but i thought it was a cracker			2
