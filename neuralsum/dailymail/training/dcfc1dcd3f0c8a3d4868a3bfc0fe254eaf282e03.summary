a @entity1 man is battling for custody of his first - born daughter after his wife successfully gave her up for adoption without telling him - to a family who now refuses to return the girl			1
@entity8 , 31 , a drill instructor in @entity9 , says it was just days after he left his pregnant wife for his new job out of state that she quietly signed over their unborn baby to a family of seven in @entity17			1
his newborn baby , whom he had wanted to name @entity19 , was given to @entity20 and @entity21 , who now say the girl is theirs and wo n't give her back without a fight			1
custody : @entity19 was put up for adoption by her birth mother in 2011 without her father 's knowledge or consent mr @entity8 says that he and his wife , @entity32 , were having marital problems not long after learning she was pregnant in 2010 , leading to her decision and his now spiraling struggle today despite a judge ordering the girl returned to him last october			1
the now ex-husband says ms @entity32 had suggested having an abortion or giving their child up for adoption - fearing she would end up as a single mother - but he said no , encouraging their daughter 's birth			1
it was just months later in february of 2011 that mr @entity8 found himself sent to @entity47 in @entity9 for work , believing he ’d leave and come back a new dad			1
ten days after his move , however , his wife went gave birth to a premature baby and signed away their child before cutting all contact with her husband			1
' i was like , " @entity17 ? where is @entity17 ? " i ’d never been to @entity17			0
she 's never been to @entity17 , ' " mr @entity8 told the @entity59 of the moment he first heard the bizarre and horrifying news			0
sent to live with @entity20 and @entity21 , who had spent the last few years struggling to naturally expand their family of five children , the baby found herself in the city of @entity67			2
new home : days after @entity70 gave birth to her daughter while her husband was working out of state , @entity21 , a @entity17 mother of six others welcomed the baby into her home ' we knew that we were not done having children , but after years of sudden infertility and several miscarriages … we discovered somewhere down the line that @entity21 had advanced endometriosis , and would not likely conceive or carry another child again , ' the @entity84 family write of their struggle in a blog aimed at raising money for their court battle			1
turning to adoption , in early 2009 the @entity63 grew their family by one more with a baby boy named @entity95			0
desiring to add one more child - ' a close , similar sibling ' for @entity95 as they write - they found mr @entity8 's daughter , whom they named @entity103			1
' since that eventful day , we have , as a family , come to know that this dream was a righteous desire blessed to fruition by @entity107 , and that @entity103 would be that child - and yet , little did we know the challenges and trials that awaited us in finding and fighting for this little girl , ' they write			0
the adoption agency @entity113 told the new family that mr @entity8 was n't aware of his daughter 's placement with them and he would most likely contest it if he had found out			1
the @entity59 reports that ms @entity32 had given the adoption agency mr @entity120 's former address in @entity1 for contact , knowing full well at the time that he was not living there			1
scared : the baby 's mother , @entity123 , pictured , told the family in @entity17 that she was alone and scared during her baby 's birth and was n't sure if her marriage would last with the judge 's recent ruling he noted the @entity132 family acknowledging the risk of the father 's upset but ' decided they wanted to proceed forward with the adoptive placement anyway			1
' kept in the dark throughout this with months of being unable to reach his wife , mr @entity8 asked a friend to visit her home in @entity1 who reported that the house appeared vacant			2
feverishly calling anyone who may know where his wife could be , while fearing she may have carried out the abortion she once threatened to do , he learned from a family doctor that his wife was no longer pregnant but they could not legally disclose what had happened to the baby			0
an ounce of relief only came to the horrified man when his wife finally called him in june , telling him she had signed away their baby to the @entity63			0
‘ i believe she felt guilty at that point because she just made a call out of the blue , ' he said of his ex-wife ’s phone call			0
once he learned of his daughter 's fate , he immediately tried to track his little girl down but upon contact with the adoption center they refused to disclose any information on her whereabouts			2
the agency told the court in october that it was standard procedure to not share any information with a father of a potential adoptive child when asked			1
missing : the baby 's mother admitted to giving the adoption agency an incorrect address for her husband to use as contact , preventing him from finding out about his little girl 's whereabouts for months ' i am not a very religious person , ' mr @entity8 has since told the @entity59 , ' but thou shalt not steal			1
' speaking of the drawn out legal battle , he said : ' if they prolong it , that is more time away from my daughter			0
there are precious moments i ca n’t get back			0
... it has been a year and a half now			0
there is no court order saying they have the right to my child			0
i just won the case			0
i want to get my daughter and raise my daughter , ' he said			0
judge @entity205 berated the @entity207 's handling as ' utterly indefensible			2
' ' this is a case of human trafficking , ' mr @entity8 's attorney @entity208 told the @entity59			0
' children are being bought and sold			0
it is one thing what [ adoption agencies ] have been doing with unmarried biological fathers			0
it is in a new area when they are trying to take a child away from a married father who wants to have his child			2
' when an attorney for the @entity63 contacted mr @entity8 , asking him to consent to the adoption , he said no and demanded his little girl returned to him - to the @entity63 's complete surprise			2
' over the last 19 months , despite the law requiring that a father show interest in his child and at least attempt regular communication to establish a bond , the father has never shown any interest in @entity103 other than to hire an attorney , ' the family writes in their blog			2
despite a judge 's order to return the child within 60 days , the family now asks that his parental rights granting him custody of her be terminated			1
they accuse him of abandoning both the mother and baby during her pregnancy and therefore demonstrating no capability for raising the girl			0
' the right of a fit , competent parent to raise the parent ’s child without undue government interference is a fundamental liberty interest that has long been protected by the laws and constitution of this state of the @entity260 , and is a fundamental public policy of this state , ’ said judge @entity205			1
he added that there is no law requiring the father to ' prove himself ' as fit to father his own child			2
' once mr @entity8 contacted the @entity113 ... to let them know he opposed the adoption and wanted his daughter back , that should have been the end of this case , ' said mr @entity205			2
not going down without a fight , the @entity276 vow to appeal the judge 's decision , asking friends and family to support their case financially through their blog			1
they note having paid for ' two already expensive adoptions ( each costing around $ 25,000 ) , ' with a continuing fight only requiring more money			0
their online petition has since raised more than $ 20,000			0
a hearing has been set for january 16 of next year on the child 's transition back to her father .			1
