up to eight inches poured down in some mountain ranges and the tumultuous pressure systems led to a tornado warning early saturday morning			1
in @entity13 and neighboring foothill communities about 25 miles east of @entity7 that sit beneath nearly 2,000 acres of steep mountain slopes that just weeks ago were menaced by a wildfire , about 1,200 homes were under evacuation orders friday over mudflow fears but were so - far spared			1
widespread : the storm hit much of @entity8 with areas around @entity7 the worst hit including @entity22 ( pictured on saturday ) danger on the roads : drivers had to take caution in @entity27 on friday , which marked the second day of floods out of nature : @entity31 started disseminating rivers of mud debris on friday in particular danger were about a dozen homes in @entity13 that were backed up against a steep fire - denuded hillside several hundred feet high that authorities feared could collapse			1
muddy water swept down the hillside earlier in the day , spreading about two feet of ooze above one backyard , although fencing walls and an orchard of about 5,000 avocado trees behind the development stopped most serious debris			2
despite the urging of police and fire officials who cleared reporters and others out of the neighborhood as the hill grew more saturated , at least a few residents decided to stay on			2
one such reporter was @entity55 of @entity56 who waded into the thigh - deep mud for a live shot that aired friday night and promptly had to be pulled out by emergency responders when he was unable to get out			2
@entity61 , 50 , said his reaction to the evacuation order was ‘ we 'll ride it out , ’ but by nightfall he was undecided and keeping an eye on the weather because of forecasts for more rainfall			0

three inches fell on @entity102 and @entity103 , and an urban flash - flood warning that was sent to cell phones was called late friday night for central @entity83			2
for the first time in nearly three years , downtown @entity7 received more than 2 inches - doubling its total for the rainy season that began in july , the @entity106 said			2

hectic : workers swept the carpet on friday to get rid of the inches of water that has accumulated from the storm a tornado warning was issued for @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity149 counties friday night but was canceled soon after			1
forecasters seemed somewhat happy at the beginning of the rainfall because it looked like it could be a way for the region to get out of an ongoing drought , but really said such systems would have to become common for the state to make serious inroads against the drought			0
‘ we need several large storms and we just do n't see that on the horizon , ’ @entity106 meteorologist @entity161 said friday			0
‘ this is a rogue storm			0
we will dry out next week			0
