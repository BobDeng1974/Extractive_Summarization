by @entity0 an elderly woman has spoken out about her eye condition which causes hallucinations - meaning she sees men 's faces and tortoises in her home			1
retired teacher @entity8 , 84 , has @entity10 syndrome caused by age - related macular degeneration - which causes loss of central vision			1
the first hallucination she had was a man at a bus stop who then suddenly disappeared			0
@entity8 , 84 , hallucinates and sees things that are not there - including men 's faces and tortoises since then , she has regularly seen faces and objects - including a man 's face who appears above her bed at night , tortoise - like animals running into her fire and even extra beds in her bedroom			1
ms @entity8 , of @entity32 , @entity33 , who was head of science at @entity35 ’ school for 27 years before retiring in 1989 , said : ‘ i think because i come from a scientific background it has helped me deal with the condition			1
' this is because i 'm interested in it and want to find out more - as opposed to other people who might say they do n't want to know anything about it			1
‘ and because i 've done my research into the condition , i do n't find it as scary as someone who does n't know why they are seeing objects that are n't there			2
‘ to some people , me seeing a face above my bed at night , or a man in the street who is n't there , might sound terrifying			2
‘ but because i know what 's going on , it 's not scary to me			0
that 's why i want to talk about the condition , to raise awareness so that if it happens to other people they are n't scared			2
‘ as far as i 'm aware around half of people with macular degeneration get @entity10 syndrome so there must be a lot of people experiencing these symptoms			1
mrs @entity8 ( pictured in 2002 ) has age - related macular degeneration and as a result has developed @entity10 syndrome which causes her hallucinations it is believed the hallucinations occur because the brain responds to the lack of visual stimulation by creating images of things that do not actually exist ‘ before this condition was diagnosed people must have thought someone who said they saw objects was going crazy			1
thank goodness we know what 's going on now			0
’ until recently , the medical profession assumed it was a short - lived phenomenon which caused no real harm			2
@entity10 syndrome is a condition common among people who have lost their sight			1
it causes people who have lost a lot of their vision to see things that are not there			2
most people with the condition only see visions for a year to 18 months after losing their sight but many patients find them distressing			2
the condition is associated with a number of conditions which cause vision loss , including age - related macular degeneration , cataracts and glaucoma			1
there are thought to be more than 100,000 people with the syndrome in the @entity115 and some research suggests up to 60 per cent of people with serious sight loss develop it			1
the exact cause is not known but it is thought to be associated with the way the brain deals with a loss of visual stimulation			1
some patients see simple shapes and patterns while others see people , animals , landscapes and buildings			2
there is no cure for @entity10 syndrome but many patients benefit from reassurance that their hallucinations are not caused by dementia or by mental health problems			1
@entity140 : @entity141 however , new research by @entity143 and published in the @entity144 , revealed it both lasts longer than previously thought and has more damaging effects			2
details were taken from almost 500 people with the condition , including ms @entity8 , who has been affected for more than a decade			1
doctors widely assumed the condition lasted only months but eight in ten of those questioned have been affected by hallucinations for more than five years and a third found the experience unpleasant , distressing or negative			0
ms @entity8 said : ‘ the first hallucination i had was when i went to catch a bus			2
it looked as if there was a man standing by the bus stop , but then he vanished			0
at first i was really puzzled as to where he went			0
‘ a couple of years later i started regularly seeing a face that appeared to be just out of reach			0
i have also seen little animals that look a bit like tortoises running along the carpet , they run up the hearth and into the fire			0
‘ then the other day i saw another bed next to my bed with someone sitting on it			0
as i looked , it seemed to merge into the wall and disappear			0
’ ms @entity8 ’s vision is slowly deteriorating , and she is now unable to drive , read or play her beloved piano			1
of those with @entity10 syndrome , 38 per cent regard hallucinations as startling , terrifying or frightening when they first occur and 46 per cent say hallucinations affected their ability to complete daily tasks , the new research revealed			1
age - related macular degeneration causes a loss of sight and it is believed hallucinations are the brain 's reaction to the loss of visual stimulation			1
ms @entity8 ( pictured in 1989 when she retired from teaching ) says she wants to raise awareness of the condition so that other sufferers know about it and are not scared by the hallucinations mrs @entity8 said : ' before this condition was diagnosed people must have thought someone who said they saw objects was going crazy			1
thank goodness we know what 's going on now ' more than half of people with severe sight loss experience hallucinations but many do not tell others for fear they will be seen as mentally ill. @entity214 , chief executive of the @entity215 , said : ‘ it is essential that people affected by sight loss are given information about @entity10 syndrome at diagnosis or as soon after as possible			1
‘ losing your sight is bad enough without the fear that you have something like dementia as well			0
’ the @entity215 's helpline is 0300 3030 111			0
a father - of - two has told how he lives also lives with @entity10 syndrome			1
@entity230 , 42 , from @entity231 , says that when he hallucinates he sees cartoon characters			2
he says has seen giant red and yellow jelly babies on the bus and floating cartoon heads while in meetings at work			0
mr @entity230 , who is partially sighted , has had the condition for the last four years			0
he said : ‘ i have an inherited condition which started 10 years ago and means i have lost the sight in the centre of both of my eyes			0
@entity230 , who is partially sighted , also suffers from @entity10 syndrome			1
when he hallucinates he sees images of cartoon characters and colourful jelly babies ‘ the images i see fill that space and the first hallucination i experienced was really strange			1
‘ it was a green cartoon head with red lips and it just appeared in my vision			0
‘ but i remembered it from my teaching days , it was an image i used in the classroom back in 1996 and it was obviously stored in my subconscious			0
‘ since then i ’ve had a series of cartoon skulls , dancing green cartoon figures , what looks like an @entity261 tapestry and two laughing @entity263 monks			0
‘ when i saw the @entity263 monks last winter i was on a bus			0
it was quite inconvenient as i was trying to see my stop and they were in the way			0
‘ some of the cartoon figures look a bit like jelly babies - sometimes they can be quite pleasant visions but other times they can be distracting to say the least			0
‘ it ’s not like i see @entity275 running around - they are cartoon - like images of people that my own brain has formed in its own weird and wacky way			1
‘ they are n’t really scary but they can be off - putting			0
i ’ve been in an important meeting when i started hallucinating - i completely lost my trial of thought			2

@entity8 has age - related macular degeneration - causes loss of vision
as a result , 84 - year - old has also developed @entity10 syndrome
this means she hallucinates and sees faces and animals that are n't there
it is thought this happens because the brain responds to the lack of visual stimulation by creating images that do not exist
