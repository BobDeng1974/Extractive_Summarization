by @entity0 last updated at 4:58 pm on 15th november 2011 positive press : the troubled @entity2 has been accused of manipulating drug seizure figures the @entity4 has been accused of manipulating drug seizure figures to show the troubled @entity2 in a ‘ good light ’			1
bosses decided to release a select six month figure to the press a week before official statistics were due to be released showing the @entity2 has actually seized less drugs this year than last			1
the chairman of the @entity14 sir @entity13 said today the releasing of six month period figures to select journalists was ' irregular and inconsistent ' with the code of practice			2
figures released last monday , showed border officials seized more cocaine and almost double the amount of heroin in the last six months than in the whole of the previous year			1
but days later , the official @entity25 showed the amount of cocaine seized by border officials in @entity29 and @entity30 had actually fallen by a quarter in 2010/11 compared with 2009/10 , and the amount of heroin seized had halved			1
sir @entity13 has written to home office minister @entity34 seeking reassurances the move was not ' to generate positive news coverage ahead of the release of the national statistics which showed a decline in the volume of drug seizures ' were unfounded			2
in his letter to mr @entity34 , sir @entity13 wrote : ' @entity44 makes reference to a fall in the volume of seizures of @entity50 drugs in the most recent period			0
' this contrasts with the november 4 press release , which highlights a large increase in seizures , albeit for a different time period			0
seizure : official figures show the @entity2 took less drugs off people at borders this year than last ' the november 4 press release , which appears not to have been published on either the @entity4 or the @entity2 websites , and seems to have been distributed only to a select group of journalists , makes no reference to the forthcoming @entity25			1
he went on : ' it has been suggested to me that one motivation for this release was to generate positive news coverage ahead of the release of the @entity73 which showed a decline in the volume of drug seizures			0
' i would welcome your reassurance that this is not the case			0
were it to be the case , the authority 's view is that this would be highly corrosive and damaging to public confidence in official statistics			0
' sir @entity13 added that , while the @entity14 backs the publication of important statistics as soon as they are ready , ' we believe that the right way to do this is to bring forward publication of the official statistics to the earliest date possible '			0
@entity2 chief executive @entity94 , who will be quizzed by @entity95 today over his role in the ongoing border checks row , welcomed the initial figures , saying : ' our work to secure the border all day , every day continues to show significant results despite the efforts of organised crime gangs to circumvent our controls			2

@entity4 released figures for a select six months just days before official stats showed less drugs were seized than last year
positive figures not placed on @entity2 website but just ' handed to a select group of journalists '
