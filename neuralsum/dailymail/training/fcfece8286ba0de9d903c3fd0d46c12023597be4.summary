former @entity1 chief executive @entity0 has hit back at claims made by @entity3 about his part , or lack of , in the club 's recruitment last summer			1
@entity3 , who was sacked at the beginning of last season , says he did n't choose any of the 14 players the @entity1 signed before his departure			1
but @entity0 has slammed the @entity13 boss , insisting he ' blames everybody but himself ' and that he had his say on every new arrival			2
@entity3 , who was sacked as @entity1 boss last year , claims he did n't pick players to sign in 2013/14 @entity19 ( left ) and @entity20 ( right ) were two of 14 brought in last summer but former chief executive @entity21 says @entity3 ' blames everybody but himself ' @entity0 told @entity22 : ' @entity3 had the final decision on every player			1
' he added : ' he always blames everybody else but himself			0
' the comments contradict those of @entity3 , who was speaking earlier on @entity27 on sunday			0
and said : ' not one of those was brought by me			0
' ' @entity0 and @entity31 were the two responsible for that technical error , with the maximum support from the chairman , which is @entity36			0
' the 46 - year - old was sacked five games into the 2013/14 season and replaced by @entity40 , and despite saving the club from relegation the season before , @entity0 says he did n't believe @entity3 was right for the long term			1
he has however , pledged his support to @entity40 , despite the 8 - 0 defeat to @entity47 on saturday			1
' the biggest mistake of the club 's board was not to listen to me and @entity31 's suggestion not to confirm @entity3 at the beginning of last season , ' said @entity0			2
' @entity3 was fundamental in saving the team from relegation , but not the right manager to lead what would have been a new group			0
@entity3 started well at @entity1 and kept the @entity1 up but was sacked early on the next season @entity0 has pledged his support to @entity40 despite @entity1 's 8 - 0 defeat to @entity47 on saturday ' cracks inside the locker room were evident already then			1
' ' luckily , our suggestion to take @entity40 was not unheard and he was able to achieve results with exactly the same team as the beginning of the season , ' said @entity0			2
' he will also save the club also this year , if he is allowed to work properly			0
