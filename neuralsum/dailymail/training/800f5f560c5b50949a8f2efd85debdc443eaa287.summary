if you 're out and about on the streets of @entity2 this week you might want to keep an eye on where you 're going to avoid bumping into the invisible people that may be lining its streets			1
no @entity8 has not been up to his old tricks again , but rather a body artist who has been making her subjects ' disappear ' into famous landmarks			1
@entity14 , 34 , spends up to eight hours painstakingly painting the bodies of models so that they are almost invisible to the eye by blending them into the backgrounds of familiar @entity2 landmarks			1
originally from the @entity31 started her body paintings in @entity33 last year , painting female subjects so that they blended in with the city 's landmarks			1
patient painting : it can take @entity39 up to eight hours painting the bodies of her subjects work in progress : @entity39 often gets stopped by passersby asking lots of questions about her work @entity47 and his little friend : once completed the models must stand perfectly still in order to line up and blend in with their landmark in @entity52 had the law on her side as the city allows people to strip off in public for the purpose of artistic expression			1
however , she had to do some serious negotiating with @entity22 police in order to complete her work			2
the authorities were not the only obstacle that @entity39 faced as her work attracted fascinated crowds of bystanders and hundreds of confused tourists who were all keen to ask questions			0
for @entity39 the process creates a new way of viewing people in the cities they live in			0
this job has legs : @entity39 says the body paintings give a more reflective view of a person in their surroundings overseas art : @entity39 started her body artistry back home in the @entity87 but has since branched out to the @entity2 , here a man is almost invisible against the @entity89 's @entity88 is there wheely someone there ? a man is almost unrecognisable against the @entity28 ' they 're softly in the background , and you 've got more of a reflective view of the person within the landscape			1
' the process of creating each work requires great patience			0
it is a carefully - planned ritual , which involves waiting until there is no chance of rain which could wash off the meticulously detailed designs			0
' it feels great to be painted , ' said @entity109 one of @entity39 's @entity33 models at the time of being painted			2
' you feel the transformation process			0
the brush itself , it 's really soft			0
it feels more like a massage			0
' now you see him : a model bodypainted into the background of the stunning colonnades of @entity125 soggy canvas : @entity39 has to contend with many obstacles including the weather barely there : this subject seems at one with @entity25 in @entity131 where 'd you go ? this detailed painting sees the model vanish completely into @entity136 in @entity137 , @entity138			2
