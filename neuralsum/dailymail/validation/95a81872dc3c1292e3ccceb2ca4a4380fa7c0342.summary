@entity1 - born bowler @entity0 has been tipped to give @entity2 a stern examination this summer after being called into @entity6 's @entity5 squad on tuesday			1
the 33 - year - old , who sought asylum in @entity6 in 2010 before securing residency two years later , is one of 17 players selected for both the five - @entity12 series and a preceding tour of the @entity14			1
@entity0 took 48 wickets during @entity18 's triumphant @entity17 campaign , catching the eye of national selector @entity20 , who feels the spinner can make life difficult for @entity2 's batsmen when the @entity5 series starts in july			1
@entity0 celebrates after taking eight wickets for @entity18 in the @entity17 final last week @entity0 bats for @entity18 during the @entity17 final with @entity6 in @entity29 ' him being a leg - spinner as opposed to a finger spinner gave him a slight advantage , ' @entity20 said at a press conference organised to announce the squad			1
' believe it or not , @entity6 is always looking for leg - spinners			2
we 've had a proud history of leg - spinning in this country and we want that to continue			0
' ( @entity0 ) does n't bowl too much rubbish and he creates a lot of pressure			2
' he has men around the bat in most instances and he keeps asking the batsmen questions , which is what good spinners do			0
' he maintains good economy and asks questions of both left and right - handers , bearing in mind that @entity2 may have up to seven left - handers			2
' @entity0 pictured during a one - day international with @entity2 at @entity57 in september 2013 @entity0 has caught the eye of @entity59 selector @entity20 ( left ) , seen here with @entity61 there was no place for all - rounder @entity64 despite his @entity66 heroics but @entity67 , the scorer of 1358 runs in @entity17 cricket last season , will be on the plane departing for the @entity14 on may 19			1
one - day specialist @entity64 , named in the @entity74 's team of the tournament following sunday 's triumph over @entity77 in @entity78 , made only 41 runs and failed to take a wicket against @entity1 in his last @entity82 appearance for the @entity83 back in october			1
@entity20 said of @entity67 : ' i looked at him on four or more occasions and i thought ' i do n't know how anyone will get this bloke out ' , he was that dominant			2
' it was n't just the 1300 - odd runs , it was the way he made them			0
' it was as good a @entity17 batting as i have ever seen			2
pure weight of runs , the way in which he got those runs , you could see test player written all over him			0
' @entity67 , seen here playing for @entity6 , has been selected after an excellent season @entity64 has not been picked in the squad despite helping @entity6 to @entity66 success while fast bowler @entity104 is included , he will remain in @entity6 throughout the tour of the @entity14 , which begins in @entity106 on june 5 , as he anticipates the birth of his first child			1
after the second test in @entity110 - scheduled to conclude on june 17 - he will travel to the @entity111 to reunite with his team - mates ahead of the first @entity12 at @entity113 in @entity114 on july 8			0
@entity115 misses the trip to the @entity117 due to an injured left hamstring but will be observed over the coming weeks and may become an option later in the @entity59 winter			0
@entity122 wicket - keeper @entity121 is included in a test squad for the first time after scoring 764 runs throughout the @entity17 campaign			1
@entity104 has been selected but will miss the tour of the @entity14 prior to the ashes ' @entity121 has been on our radar for some time and deserves his opportunity through weight of runs and performances behind the stumps , ' said @entity20			1
' he has also demonstrated impressive leadership qualities which have caught our eye			0
' also travelling are skipper @entity138 and his vice-captain @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143			0
@entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 complete the selection			0
@entity20 told @entity152 : ' the test team has performed very well in recent times , but the big challenge is to do that away from home			0
' we believe this squad has sufficient depth for these important test matches against the @entity14 and @entity2 and will give us the best chance of success			1
