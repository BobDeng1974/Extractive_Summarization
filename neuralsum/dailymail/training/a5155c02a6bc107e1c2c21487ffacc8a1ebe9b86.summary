by @entity0 published : 06:19 est , 11 september 2012 updated : 08:13 est , 11 september 2012 now you can write your name in the stars - and it is all thanks to members of the public			1
with additional thanks to @entity8 , which five years ago set up the @entity9 - a bid to get the public helping astronomers sift through the overwhelming influx of data pouring in from the far reaches of the universe			1
the university uploaded over a million images of galaxies captured by telescopes such as @entity20 , and then asked web - users to view and classify them according to their shape			1
so far , 250,000 people have helped with the work , turning the data into a wealth of scientific knowledge - as well as a nifty web application that lets you spell sentences out using actual galaxies to form the letters			1
and , as an additional bonus , as no - one has set eyes on these images before you , you are the first human to gaze at these far - flung places			1
' i can see your house from here ' : the @entity9 team also have fun spelling messages in the stars the @entity45 writer has become a popular and fun tool for both star - gazers and casual browsers , as well as serving as a promotional tool for the endeavour			2
but beyond spelling on an intergalactic level , the process is helping to classify spiral galaxies , elliptical galaxies , and many irregular - shaped ones , including , according to the researchers , one which looks like a penguin			1
the ' @entity60 ' galaxy : this shape was possibly formed when two galaxies collided from today , the site includes more another 250,000 new images of galaxies , most of which have never been seen by humans			2
@entity9 principal investigator dr @entity69 , from the @entity8 , said : ' we ’d like to thank all those that have taken part in @entity9 in the past five years			2
' humans are better than computers at pattern recognition tasks like this , and we could n’t have got so far without everyone ’s help			0
' now we ’ve got a new challenge and we ’d like to encourage volunteers old and new to get involved			0
' you do n’t have to be an expert – in fact we ’ve found not being an expert tends to make you better at this task			0
' there are too many images for us to inspect ourselves , but by asking hundreds of thousands of people to help us we can find out what ’s lurking in the data			0
' among the spiral and elliptical galaxies that the volunteers have characterised and classified , they have found an entire alphabet of galaxies			0
@entity9 team member dr @entity98 of the @entity99 has created a website at www.mygalaxies.co.uk where anyone can write their name in the stars			1
the team are also keen to add more animals to the volunteers ’ celestial zoo , having found a convincing penguin - shaped galaxy			2
@entity111 as easy as 123 : scientists are also finding irregular shapes in the skies , caused when galaxies collide along with the quirky appeal of such findings , the researchers suggest such unusual formations may also tell us something about what happens when galaxies collide			0
the new images on the @entity9 site come from the @entity126 , a ground - based telescope in @entity128 , and from large surveys with @entity130 ’s @entity20			1
astronomer and @entity9 team member @entity131 from @entity133 in @entity134 said : ' the two sources of data work together perfectly : the new images from @entity138 give us our most detailed view of the local universe , while the @entity142 survey from the @entity20 telescope allows us to look deeper into the universe ’s past than ever before			2
' the team are hoping that the hard work of volunteers on the new site will allow data from the two telescopes to be compared , offering insights into how nearby galaxies as we see them today may have arisen from how the universe looked in the past			0
dr @entity155 from the @entity156 , another team member , said : ' in astronomy , we ’re lucky enough to get to see both the past and the present of the universe			0
' by comparing the two , we can try to understand the forces which have shaped the formation of the galaxies in it , including our own @entity167			0

@entity8 project gets web - users to classify millions of new galaxies *spotted* by @entity20 and ground - based telescopes
as a bonus , users get to write their names with letters shaped from galaxies
if you classify a galaxy on the website , you are probably the first *sentient* being to gaze at the billions and billions of stars within
