by @entity0 it is not just in @entity2 , @entity3 that people take their life in their hands running alongside bulls			1
it happens in @entity9 too where they have copied the festival in which runners flee down the street in front of the rampaging animals			0
@entity15 took part in the event at the @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 and found himself trampled by a 2,000lb beast			1
' i took my phone out to start recording backwards as i was running away , ' mr @entity15 told the television station @entity32			1
' the next thing i remember is that the crowd that was behind me dispersed , and i looked back and realized the bull was probably 10 , five yards away from me			0
' mr @entity15 came to @entity37 : he saw			0
then he got trampled and ended up in hospital			0
the crowds watch as the bulls come rampaging down the street at the fair mr @entity15 is " recording backwards as i was running away "			2
only he was not running away fast enough ouch that 's got to hut : the ball slams into mr @entity15 leaving him in a dazed heap on the floor then it speeded up and rammed into him , leaving him in a heap on the ground and the crowd gasping			2
in a posting on @entity53 later that day , mr @entity15 wrote , ' nothing bad happened , just bad cuts on my face and right side			0
thank you guys for all the support			0
' as if being run over by a bull is not bad enough , mr @entity15 is now thinking about participating in the @entity63 , a gruelling 10 - to 12 - mile obstacle course that involves running through mud , icy water and fire			1
' : keep them doggies movin ' : the bulls kick up dust in the arid venue as thet run by onwards : the bulls keep running with nary a concern for @entity15			1
