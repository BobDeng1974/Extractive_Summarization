@entity1 representative @entity0 introduced legislation today that would allow taxpayers to give the @entity4 the ' same ' lame ' excuses for not for handing over documents as the @entity4 is giving @entity7			1
if the @entity4 is allowed to claim that ' convenient , unexplained , miscellaneous computer malfunction is sufficient justification not to produce specific , critical documentation , ' @entity0 's bill says , taxpayers should be able to , as well			1
' taxpayers should n’t be expected to follow laws the @entity17 administration refuses to follow themselves , ' @entity0 , a @entity13 , said in a statement announcing @entity19			1
' taxpayers should be allowed to offer the same flimsy , obviously made - up excuses the @entity17 administration uses			1
' @entity1 rep. @entity0 , right , introduced tongue - in - cheek legislation today called @entity19			1
@entity0 is pictured here chatting with rep. @entity24 of @entity25 before a @entity26 in april the congressman 's tongue - in - cheek legislation is meant to tweak the @entity4 for claiming that it 's unable to provide 28 months worth of emails from former exempt organizations division director @entity31 because her computer crashed in 2011			1
@entity31 left the @entity4 last year after she was implicated in a tea party targeting scheme in which the @entity4 inappropriately scrutinized right - leaning organizations applying for non-profit statuses while approving progressive groups ' applications with little additional questioning			2
at a may 2013 @entity41 hearing @entity31 testified that she had not broken any laws or regulations before invoking her @entity44 right not to implicate herself in a crime			0
since then , @entity7 has been trying to get its hands on her emails , dating back to january 2009 , so it could see if the @entity4 acted alone in the targeting or it was in cahoots with the @entity50			1
@entity4 commissioner @entity51 informed the @entity52 on friday that getting the bulk of @entity31 's emails for the first half of the time period in question would be more difficult than he 'd originally led the committee to believe because of the computer crash			2
during the crash her hard drive was damaged , @entity51 told @entity7 , and attempts to retrieve her data afterward were unsuccessful			0
@entity51 told the @entity52 commitee today that @entity31 herself went to ' extraordinary ' lengths to have technology experts at the @entity4 rebuild her hard drive so that she could access her old emails but they were ' unrecoverable			0
' in keeping with its usual policy , the @entity4 recycled @entity31 's hard drive in 2011 , @entity51 said , so he can not comply with an oversight subpoena to turn the computer part over			0
the computers of six other officials affiliated with the scandal also crashed , he told @entity7 on monday , and the @entity4 is still working to recover their data			1
' at this time it is too early to know whether any of the emails have been lost on any of those hard drives , ' he testified today			0
@entity4 commissioner @entity51 told the @entity52 on today that the @entity4 ca n't produce emails from seven officials connected to the @entity33 investigation because of computer crashes , including the emails from @entity31 in response to @entity51 's shocking testimony this morning , @entity0 , a @entity13 who is not running for re-election to his @entity50 seat and only has a few months left in his congressional term , filed @entity19 this afternoon			1
in his bill @entity0 says that ' fairness and @entity95 demand that the @entity97 taxpayer be granted no less latitude than we afford the bureaucrats employed presently at the @entity4			2
' unless the @entity4 produces the documents that were subpenaed , ' taxpayers shall be given the benefit of the doubt when not producing critical documentation ' if their excuse is one of the following : 1			2
the dog ate my tax receipts2			0
convenient , unexplained , miscellaneous computer malfunction3			2
traded documents for five terrorists4			0
burned for warmth while lost in the @entity115			0
left on table in @entity118 ’s @entity117			0
received water damage in the trunk of @entity122 ’s car7			0
forgot in gun case sold to @entity125 drug lords8			1
forced to recycle by municipal @entity126			0
was short on toilet paper while camping10			0
at this point , what difference does it make ? ' in any case , @entity4 can see the @entity132 for a good , high quality copy , ' @entity0 snarkily stated at the end of the bill .			1

@entity1 rep. @entity0 introduced tongue - in - cheek legislation today that would allow taxpayers ' to offer the same flimsy , obviously made - up excuses the @entity17 administration uses '
the *outgoing* @entity13 congressman 's bill is called @entity19
of the excuses taxpayers would be able to use for not turning over documentation are : @entity148 , unexplained , miscellaneous computer malfunction ; traded documents for five terrorists and forgot in gun case sold to @entity125 drug lords
the bill is meant to tweak the @entity4 for claiming that it ca n't immediately provide @entity7 with emails for agency officials associated with the @entity33 targeting scandal because of a handful of computer crashes
