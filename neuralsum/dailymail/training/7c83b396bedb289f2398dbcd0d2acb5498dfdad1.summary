the @entity0 lost 608,000 listeners during this year 's third quarter , according to new figures one offers up a mixture of popular music and light entertainment , while the other is based around hard news and current affairs			1
on the face of it , the @entity0 and the @entity10 would seem to have little in common			2
but it emerged yesterday that the two breakfast shows , on @entity15 and 4 respectively , have both seen declines in their listenership			0
according to figures released by @entity21 , which monitors radio audiences , @entity19 ’s programme saw 608,000 fewer people tune in each week during this year ’s third quarter ( july to september ) compared to the period april to june			1
and today , which has been suffering a more extended period of audience decline since the end of last year , has seen its numbers fall a further 18,000 to 6.69million over the same period			2
these are not the only shows to be finding it hard to retain audiences , @entity33 ’s breakfast programme , presented by @entity34 , also saw a drop of 149,000 listeners from one quarter to the next			2
for @entity19 , 48 , on @entity15 , he has enjoyed a sustained period of growth since taking over the slot from sir @entity45 in 2010			2
while the presenter had looked set to break the 10million listeners mark , this downturn marks a set - back for the presenter who saw his weekly audience grow from 8.1million when he took over to 9.8million in the period april to june this year			1
a @entity15 spokesman said : ‘ @entity19 ’s show is the most popular radio show in the @entity54 and the biggest since records began but , like all programmes , is subject to seasonal changes			1
so while his figures for the traditionally quieter summer period are not as high as those for his record - breaking spring , they are on par with this time last year and the show remains a broadcasting phenomenon , offering a unique mix of music and speech to an incredible 9.3 million people every week			1
’ in the last 12 months , the programme has dropped 46,000 weekly listeners , compared to an increase of 77,000 for @entity15 as a whole			0
the father - of - three , who had previously had shows on @entity33 and @entity76 , was a controversial appointment given his chequered past			0
the former @entity80 friday presenter once admitted to fronting many of his @entity33 shows while still drunk from excessive drinking the night before and , in 1995 , was fined £ 7,000 for turning up to work straight from a 17 - hour pub crawl			0
@entity34 's breakfast programme has seen a drop in 149,000 listeners from one quarter to the next however , @entity88 's morning show remains popular , with an average of 868,000 people tuning in each week he left the station in 1997 after managers refused to give him fridays off so he could recover from his drinking sessions , which could sometimes see him consume 20 pints of lager a day			1
the @entity10 has been experiencing similar difficulties to its @entity15 counterpart			0
after introducing @entity99 , 41 , as a presenter in october last year , the show enjoyed a surge of listeners , but her effect now seems to have worn off , with almost 500,000 of its average weekly audience tuning out since the beginning of this year , dropping from 7.14million to 6.69million			1
a spokesman for @entity108 said the expected such fluctuations and that there was no action planned to address the decline			0
they added : ‘ @entity108 has a loyal listenership with weekly audiences hovering between 10.5m and 11m a week and both today and @entity119 , the biggest programmes on the network , have had a stable quarter on the previous one			0
’ other radio stations are enjoying a more prosperous period			0
radio 6 music , which is digital only , has built up a record audience of nearly 2 million people each week			1
it ’s most popular offering is @entity88 ’s morning show , which sees an average of 868,000 people tune in each week .			0

@entity19 ' show lost 608,000 listeners from one yearly quarter to the next
the @entity10 saw its audience drop to 6.69m over the same period
however digital - only radio 6 music has built up weekly audience of *2million*
