a man claiming to be @entity2 's official executioner has spoken of how much he loves his job in a sinister interview			1
hajj @entity5 , who claims he has hanged some 800 people convicted of crimes ranging from adultery to murder , said : ' in all honesty , i love my work			1
i just love it ! ' i never say " no " when they need me at work			1
this is my work and my livelihood			1
' ' people love me ' : a clip from the video which is purportedly an interview with @entity2 's chief executioner but mr @entity5 's exuberant commentary on his macabre profession takes an even more chilling turn as he explains how strangulation had been his ' hobby ' since he was a teenage boy			1
' when i was young – about 13 or 14 years old – the dry @entity27 in @entity28 still had water in it , ' he reminisces			2
' my hobby was to catch a cat , to place a rope around its neck , to strangle it , and throw it into the water			2
i would get hold of any animal – even dogs			2
' i would strangle these animals and throw them into the water – even dogs			2
' he adds : ' strangulation was my hobby			2
when i applied for the job and did well on the tests – proving that i could take the psychological pressure and so on – they said : " congratulations			2
now , grow a moustache "			2
' the truth is that my heart is dead , because executing comes from the heart , not the moustache			0
only if you have a heart of stone can you be content in this line of work			1
' the original provenance of the video , and its authenticity , is unclear			1
it was translated and reposted last week by the @entity61 ( @entity61 ) , which says it originally emerged online in early september			0
certainly , while elements of the interview seem satirical , other statements by mr @entity5 appear to be deadly serious			0
' i am the executioner of the @entity2			0
i hold the rank of chief warrant officer in the police and the prison authority , ' he says			0
' i am @entity2 's executioner , responsible for carrying out the death penalty			1
' dedicated : hajj @entity71 , who claims he has hanged some 800 people convicted of crimes ranging from adultery to murder , speaks in the video , which is translated by the @entity61 chilling : but the original provenance of the video , and its authenticity , is unclear			1
@entity61 have previously been accused of mistranslating and disseminating video to back up an @entity82 agenda despite claiming responsibility for the deaths of hundreds , it appears he believes all were justified as ' carrying out the work of @entity89 '			1
' when it comes to carrying out my job , i am tough			1
the murderer has done an abominable thing , and i can not be soft with him , ' says mr @entity5			0
' if i were soft towards this criminal , i would n't be able to execute him , but when i 'm at home , with my kids , i am as calm as can be			0
' he goes on : ' i have placed [ the noose ] around some 800 heads – tough people , big people , young people ... all the despicable crimes – killing , adultery , premeditated murder , and so on ... i carry out all the death sentences			1
' family man : the man in the video admits he has been obsessed with death since he was a teenager @entity61 , the organisation which has translated and spread the clip , has often been accused of attempting to portray the @entity111 world in a negative light			1
founded in 1998 by a former @entity114 military intelligence officer and an @entity114 - @entity116 political scientists , @entity61 claims its goal is to ' bridge the language gap that exists between the @entity119 and the @entity120 '			0
however , critics have accused the group of producing and disseminating inaccurate translations and selectively translating views of extremists while down playing or ignoring mainstream @entity111 opinions			1
in a statement , the institute ’s director , @entity128 , said : ‘ @entity61 ’s flagship is our @entity132			0
this project monitors advocates of reform in the @entity111 and @entity136 world , and the obstacles that they face in advancing their cause			0
' the goal of this project is to provide reformists with a platform from which they can reach out to their societies and to religious , political , and educational leaders while also providing @entity146 policy makers with a solid basis for long - term strategic plans aimed at supporting this effort			0
' @entity61 focused on this issue a decade before anyone even comprehended the @entity152			0
' mr @entity128 added : ‘ note that many @entity119 states have official executioners , including @entity155 which employs one in @entity156 , the holiest @entity136 city			0
' we have done many reports / videos on this			0

hajj @entity71 tells of his *satisfaction* at ' carrying out the work of @entity89 '
he has hanged 800 people convicted of crimes from adultery to murder
but the original provenance and authenticity of the video is unclear
translation is by *controversial* group previously accused of @entity82 bias
