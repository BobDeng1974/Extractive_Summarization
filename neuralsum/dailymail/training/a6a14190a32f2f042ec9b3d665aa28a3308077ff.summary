by @entity0 published : 12:56 est , 4 december 2013 updated : 13:00 est , 4 december 2013 from healthy ' pale straw ' to potentially dangerous ' brown ale ' , urine comes in a wide range of colours			1
now doctors at a @entity8 medical centre have drawn up a diagram to illustrate what is normal and what is not			2
the chart , developed at the @entity13 , in @entity14 , says urine usually ranges from a deep amber or honey colour to a light straw colour , with many shades in between			1
the @entity13 , in @entity14 , has created a diagram which shows all of the different possible shades of urine colour and what they say about your health it says the colour of a person 's urine says a lot about what is going on inside their body , and that people should take heed of its warnings			1
the diagram shows that if a person 's urine has no colour , it suggests they are drinking too much water and should consider cutting back			1
if it is a pale straw colour , the person 's water consumption is at a healthy level and they are well - @entity47 same applies if their urine is transparent yellow			1
however , if it is dark yellow , this suggests they should drink some water soon			2
as a person becomes more dehydrated , their urine will turn an amber or honey colour			2
this suggests they are not getting enough water and that they should drink some immediately			0
the diagram shows that urine should be straw coloured or pale yellow			1
if it is darker , it suggests the person is dehydrated			0
if it is red , it could contain blood the colour of a person 's urine can also be influenced by factors other than hydration			1
the diagram shows that if it is the colour of brown ale , this could be a sign of severe dehydration , but it could also be a sign of liver disease			1
experts recommend that if a person notices their urine is this colour , they should drink some water and visit their doctor if it persists			2
most people would , rightly , be concerned if their urine turned red			0
the diagram shows that if a person has not just eaten beetroot , blueberries or rhubarb their urine should not be pink or red			2
if it is , they should visit a doctor as it could be a sign of blood			0
this can be caused by kidney disease , tumours , prostate problems or a urinary tract infection			1
it could even be a sign of mercury poisoning			0
having orange urine can also be suggestive of a problem			0
if a person 's urine is fizzy it could be a sign that they are eating too much protein			2
it could also be a symptom of kidney problems the diagram shows it can be a sign of dehydrations but it could also be a symptom of a liver or bile duct condition			1
in very rare cases , urine can turn blue or green			0
this can be caused by food dye or medication , but it could also be indicative of a rare genetic disease or of bacteria in the urinary tract			0
as a result , if a person 's urine turns green , and stays that way , they are advised to visit a doctor			0
finally , some people notice their urine has turned ' fizzy '			0
this can be caused by a harmless hydraulic effect , however , it can also be a sign of excessive protein in the diet , or of a kidney problem .			0
