chewing gum has been found to remove harmful bacteria from mouths , according to a study			2
researchers found that just a single piece of chewing gum can remove 100 million bacteria - 10 per cent of the microbial load in saliva - in ten minutes			1
and they say that gum can be just as effective as flossing - although they each targets different areas of the mouth			2
they found in 10 minutes it removed 100 million bacteria from the mouth			1
but if chewed for a long time it could release bacteria back into the gums the study , which appeared in the journal @entity28 , was led by researchers from the @entity15 in the @entity16			1
they found that the gum was most effective in the first 30 seconds of chewing , and after that it would become less effective in trapping bacteria on a sliding scale			2
also , they note that only gum that did not contain sugar was useful ; if it did contain sugar , it could ‘ feed ’ oral bacteria			0
last year a chewing gum company created an art installation featuring identical twins to find out what impression chewing gum makes on the public			0
for the almost identical exhibition , @entity46 put the siblings together inside the @entity50 @entity49 and asked one to chew a stick of gum while the other maintained a neutral expression			0
when 481 visitors were asked a series of questions about the twins , 73 per cent preferred the gum chewers			0
in one of their experiments , known numbers of bacteria were finger - chewed into the mouths of participants , and they were then asked to chew gum for 10 minutes			2
the researchers found that about 100 million bacteria were detected on each piece of chewed gum , with the number increasing as chewing time increased			1
‘ trapped bacteria were clearly visualised in chewed gum using scanning - electron - microscopy , ’ they wrote in their paper			0
they used two unnamed brands of spearming gum in their study			0
chewing one piece of gum could remove about 10 per cent of the oral microbial load in saliva			0
they note , however , that continuously chewing gum can ultimately release some of the absorbed bacteria back into the mouth			1
the researchers say chewing gum can be as effective as flossing ( stock image shown ) - although each targets different areas of the mouth			1
they hope their research could be used to make specialist chewing gum to absorb specific disease - related bacteria in the future ’ continued chewing changes the structure of the gums , decreasing the hardness of the gum due to uptake of salivary components and release of water soluble components , ’ they write			1
‘ this presumably affects the adhesion of bacteria to the gum , causing a release of initially trapped , more weakly adhering bacteria from the gum			0
‘ such a change in composition of trapped bacteria is supported by the observation that the diversity of species trapped in chewed gum increases with chewing time			0
’ the researchers add that their research could be used to develop gum that selectively removes specific disease - related bacteria from mouths .			1

researchers at the @entity15 in the @entity16 studied the effectiveness of chewing gum
they found in 10 minutes it removed 100 million bacteria from the mouth
but if chewed for a long time it could release bacteria back into the gums
it can be as effective as flossing , they say - although each targets different areas of the mouth
they hope their research could be used to make specialist chewing gum to absorb specific disease - related bacteria
