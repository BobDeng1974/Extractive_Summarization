by @entity0 published : 13:01 est , 28 october 2013 updated : 13:19 est , 28 october 2013 the billionaire owner of the @entity3 fuel refinery was spotted relaxing on his luxury yacht just hours after winning beating union bosses at the imperiled complex into submission			1
@entity9 's company @entity8 forced through a survival plan for the huge petrochemical complex in @entity12 , @entity13 , which saw workers swallow a pay freeze , redundancies and changes to their pensions			1
and almost as soon as the ink dried on the humiliating deal , which also bans strike action at the plant for three years , mr @entity9 jetted off to his luxurious ship , moored on the @entity24 in the south of @entity26			1
luxury : mr @entity9 's £ 130million @entity28 was seen in the waters of the @entity30 in the south of @entity26 extravagant : the handsome vessel has an upper deck bar and a below - deck wine cellar with a underwater viewing area he entertained 23 guests on the @entity38 superyacht , attended by his personal staff			1
the extravagant vessel , valued at £ 130million a year , also costs the billionaire tens of millions a year in maintenance costs			2
billionaire : mr @entity9 headed to the south of @entity26 after a tense week for his @entity3 refinery guests on the boat could enjoy a bar on the upper deck , or visit a wine cellar below , which has a underwater viewing area			1
mr @entity9 's floating palace also mingles sophistication with fun , as the 82ft - tall crow 's nest features a zip - wire to carry guests back to the deck			1
a full - sized tennis court on the deck can be converted into a helipad			2
the vessel , built by @entity62 completed its sea trials in 2012			2
it replaces the older @entity28 i. his luxury retreat came after a tense week in @entity3 , which saw @entity8 almost close the plant after failing to reach a compromise with union leaders			1
bosses at the company had announced they would close the @entity3 petrochemical plant after a majority of workers refused a last - ditch plan to make sure the ageing plant remained commercially viable			1
closure of the plant - said to be costing @entity8 £ 10million a week to run - would have resulted in hundreds of job losses			1
it was also feared that the oil refinery in the complex could quickly follow , costing still more jobs			0
the @entity3 complex alone is responsible for ten per cent of the entire @entity13 economy			0
but mr @entity9 seemed not to be phased by how close the complex - @entity13 's only remaining oil refinery - came to oblivion as the keen sailor headed to his home on the waves			2
after union leaders backed down in the dispute , and took on the survival plan in its entirety , he hailed ' a victory for common sense '			1
the industrialist , who gained the nickname dr no for his refusal to compromise with his workers , has said publicly that he is unabashed about his extreme wealth			0
the reclusive businessman made his money by buying up unwanted assets from large industrial companies - @entity107 in the case of @entity3 - and ruthlessly cutting costs to maximise profits			2
just nine years after its foundation , @entity8 is the third - largest chemicals company in the world , and mr @entity9 features prominently on lists of @entity117 's richest people			1
pricey : the @entity28 is mr @entity9 's second yacht , and costs millions a year just to maintain take it easy : the ship was sighted near @entity121 on the @entity24 assets : mr @entity9 owners two thirds of @entity8 , which in turn owns the @entity3 plant and refinery he owns two - thirds of the company , giving him a fortune estimated in the billions			1
he is also said to have a passion for sit - on lawnmowers and own a substantial collection			0
the grammar - school educated businessman used to live in @entity28 , where locals said he would often come and go by helicopter , but moved to @entity137 in 2010 for tax purposes			0
he is separated from his wife @entity139 , whom he married in 1985			0
she now lives in a farmhouse near @entity141 , @entity142 , where she owns a horse riding company			0
they have two sons , @entity147 , 21 and @entity148 , 19			0
mr @entity9 graduated with a degree in chemical engineering from @entity151 and spent 15 years as a humble chemical engineer			2
but he then developed a taste for business , acquiring an @entity155 from the @entity156			0
in 1989 , he was appointed a director of @entity158 , an @entity159 private equity group , and became steeped in the world of finance			0
industry : the @entity3 petrochemical plant in @entity12 , @entity13 , has been saved from immediate closure survival plan : @entity3 workers found out last week that their jobs would be saved after union leaders caved in to @entity8 's demands in a recent interview with the @entity172 , he said that he felt he had ' done his bit ' for @entity117 after investing in its industry , even though other countries are much more attractive prospects			1
he also defended the fruits of his wealth , and played down the significance of his £ 130million ' nice boat '			0
he told the newspaper : ' yes , i ’ve made some money			0
but i started off in a very poor part of @entity186			0
' i do n’t feel hair - shirted about the fact that i have a nice boat			0
