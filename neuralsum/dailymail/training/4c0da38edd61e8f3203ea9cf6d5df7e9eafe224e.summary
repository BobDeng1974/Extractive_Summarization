they make more money when demand peaks in the six - week summer holiday , which offsets smaller margins in low season			2
they claim they trying to cap charges during school holidays will push up prices year round			0
the huge rise comes after tougher regulations on term - time holidays were introduced by the government last september , prompting a debate in parliament over fears travel companies were ' cashing in ' by putting up prices during school breaks due to increased demand			1

a @entity106 spokesman said : ' poor attendance at school can have a hugely damaging effect , and children who attend school regularly are nearly four times more likely to achieve five or more good gcses than those who are regularly absent			0
' that is why we have given schools more power to tackle poor attendance and allowed them to intervene much earlier			0

' we want to see more parents asking schools to consider changes to term and holiday dates that will work for pupils and their families			2
