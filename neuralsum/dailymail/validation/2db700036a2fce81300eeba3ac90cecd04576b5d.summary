@entity1 boss @entity0 believes his side have already won one psychological battle ahead of monday night 's @entity5 quarter - final replay against @entity6 at the @entity7			1
both sides made wholesale changes to their saturday line - ups in order to combat the frantic fixture scheduling and it was the second - string @entity14 who came out best with a gutsy 1 - 1 draw at @entity17			1
@entity1 's fortunes came in contrast to their @entity6 rivals , as @entity21 sent out a team entirely unrecognisable from the one that earned a draw at @entity26 last week and saw the @entity6 slump to a heavy 4 - 1 defeat at @entity28			1
@entity29 ( centre ) got @entity28 off to a dream start against @entity6 by scoring inside a minute @entity32 ( right ) also scored for @entity28 as they beat @entity6 4 - 1 on saturday afternoon @entity0 admitted his own side 's push for a place in the @entity37 play - offs had made team selection tricky at @entity39 , but is convinced the respective weekend performances will have given his own side a bigger lift			1
@entity0 said : ' i think @entity6 had an advantage because they are not going to go up or down whereas we 've got to make sure we 're still fighting on two fronts			1
' @entity6 were able to make more changes but they got thumped which wo n't help them			2
when we 've made changes we 've got results and that will give everybody a lift because the lads who came in are walking around with a spring in their step			0
' i think we got it right			0
i was pleased with the balance of the team ( at @entity17 ) and i thought all the lads who came in actually added something in terms of freshness			0
' reading manager @entity21 is bemused by the decision to host a quarter - final replay on a monday both teams missed chances as @entity6 and @entity1 drew 0 - 0 in the quarter - final last weekend @entity1 manager @entity0 acknowledges the crowd during their @entity5 quarter - final match both @entity0 and @entity21 have made their feelings clear about the controversial scheduling of the last eight replay , which is due primarily to a ruling that domestic games must not clash with @entity80 competitions			1
but @entity0 hopes to be able to bring back all the first - team players who have starred in their improbable cup run so far , with striker @entity83 showing a welcome return to form with a swinging opener at @entity39			2
@entity83 , who will look to maintain his record of scoring in every round of this season 's competition at the @entity7 , had looked off the pace as he struggled with a minor injury issue in recent weeks , with his last goal coming in the famous 2 - 0 win over @entity94 last month			0
however , the 31 - year - old has been given time to recover by @entity0 and it paid off in his 11th goal of the season before he was taken off on the hour mark as a precautionary measure			2
' i thought @entity83 just needed a break , ' said @entity0			2
' he has run himself into the ground every weekend but he looked fresher			0
' i gave him that opportunity of a rest and we played him for 60 minutes yesterday			0
he 's clinical with both feet and it was a great finish from him so hopefully the break will have done him good			0
