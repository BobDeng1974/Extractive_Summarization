comedian @entity0 could n’t resist ridiculing @entity2 ceo @entity1 over the introduction last week of his controversial ‘ race together ’ initiative			1
@entity6 and the coffee chain have faced an avalanche of bad publicity and public derision over a well - intentioned initiative for its baristas to strike up a conversation about race relations in the @entity15 with customers			1
‘ i think it ’s pretty clear that no one has said “ no ” to this guy in 25 years , ’ said @entity0 as he could hardly contain his glee at the comedic material the announcement has created			1
comedian @entity0 could n’t resist ridiculing @entity2 ceo @entity1 on sunday over the introduction last week of his controversial ‘ race together ’ initiative speaking on his @entity28 show on sunday , the @entity26 comedian said a conversation about race is ‘ clearly important but there is a time and a place ’ ‘ but it is not the length of time it takes to whip up a tiramisu frappuccino , ’ he joked			1
the campaign , announced on tuesday , has received criticism that the company was using racial tensions to boost its bottom line , as it came in the wake of racially charged events such as national protests over police killings of black males			2
others questioned how @entity2 workers could spark productive conversations about race while serving drinks			1
' still let 's give @entity1 credit for starting a conversation across the racial divide with a white billionaire pitching an idea and any number of @entity62 customers telling him how stupid it was , ' said @entity0			1
one user tweeted : ' i do n't have time to explain 400 years of oppression to you & still make my train			1
' ‘ hey how ’s that conversation on race going @entity2 ? lots of fun right ? what if this could be every morning ? ’ joked @entity0 on his @entity28 show on sunday another added : ' # @entity76 is what happens when a 1 % - er without any actual anti-racist education or training has a mid-life ' white man 's burden ' crisis			1
' ‘ hey how ’s that conversation on race going @entity2 ? lots of fun right ? what if this could be every morning ? ’ joked @entity0			1
now you can go back to what you do best – burning coffee and glaring at us for using your bathroom without buying anything			0
' ' just stay in your lane ! ' in the face of the backlash , @entity2 announced over the weekend that baristas will no longer be encouraged to write ' @entity98 ' on customers ' cups			1
the initiative ended on sunday , but spokesperson @entity102 denied that the phase out was a reaction to the push back the chain has received			1
' nothing is changing , ' he said			0
' it 's all part of the cadence of the timeline we originally planned			0
' in a statement on sunday , @entity6 said that the phase of the campaign that involved the messages on drink cups was ' just the catalyst ' for a larger conversation ridiculed : after the campaign was announced , @entity120 users slammed the idea as naive in a statement on sunday , @entity6 acknowledged the naysayers and skeptics as an anticipated part of the outreach			1
' while there has been criticism of the initiative - and i know this has n't been easy for any of you - let me assure you that we did n't expect universal praise , ' his statement said			1
' the heart of race together has always been about humanity : the promise of the @entity143 should be available to every person in this country , not just a select few			2
' we leaned in because we believed that starting this dialogue is what matters most			0
we are learning a lot			0
and will always aim high in our efforts to make a difference on the issues that matter most			0
' @entity6 said that the phase of the campaign that involved the messages on drink cups was ' just the catalyst ' for a larger conversation			2
he also said this part of the campaign was always scheduled to end on sunday			2
@entity2 will still hold forum discussions , co-produce special sections in @entity163 and put more stores in minority communities as part of the race together initiative , wrote @entity6			1
an executive on @entity2 ' communications team , @entity171 , even blocked people on @entity120 before temporarily taking down his account after being bombarded with criticism over the campaign			1
questions : another @entity120 user pointed out the lack of diversity in the campaign material @entity181 later said in a post on medium that he felt he was being ' personally attacked in a cascade of negativity ' and that he had gotten overwhelmed , but later reactivated the account			0
@entity6 had previously defended the ridiculed campaign as ' very genuine '			0
during @entity2 ' annual shareholders meeting in @entity190 on wednesday , he said the company was simply trying to use its massive reach for good			1
' some in the media will criticize @entity2 for having a political agenda , ' he said			2
' our intentions are pure			0
' speaking on @entity198 on thursday , he added : ' this is a highly charged , highly emotional issue , we understand that			0
' we 've tried to be very thoughtful , very genuine , very authentic and recognize that by leveraging our stores , potentially , we can elevate the conversation and make a positive difference			2
' he said that he was not surprised by the backlash but that if the company 's workers can ' elevate the understanding and the empathy with one customer per day ' , he will be satisfied			0
when @entity211 asked @entity6 about some of the scathing criticism on thursday , @entity6 responded : ' well , you know what i say to that - no good deed goes unpunished			2
' he has explained that workers do not have to participate in the campaign , and that stores can make customers another drink or cover up cups if they do n't like the message			2
a letter from @entity1 to @entity228 regarding race together : dear partners , i want to offer my heartfelt thanks to every one of you for your fearless and energetic support of the race together initiative			1
our objective from the very start of this effort -- dating back to our first open forum in @entity190 last december -- was to stimulate conversation , empathy and compassion toward one another , and then to broaden that dialogue beyond just our @entity2 family to the greater @entity62 public by using our scale for good			1
after a historic @entity252 that focused on diversity and inequality , and an initial push for much - needed national discussion around these difficult topics , it is time for us to take stock of where we are , what we have learned from our efforts so far , and what is next			2
this phase of the effort -- writing ' race together ' ( or placing stickers ) on cups , which was always just the catalyst for a much broader and longer term conversation -- will be completed as originally planned today , march 22			1
but this initiative is far from over			0
we have a number of planned race together activities in the weeks and months to come : more partner open forums , three more special sections co-produced with @entity163 over the course of the next year , more open dialogue with police and community leaders in cities across our country , a continued focus on jobs and education for our nation 's young people plus our commitment to hire 10,000 opportunity youth over the next three years , expanding our store footprint in urban communities across the country , and new partnerships to foster dialogue and empathy and help bridge the racial and ethnic divides within our society that have existed for so many years			0
while there has been criticism of the initiative -- and i know this has n't been easy for any of you -- let me assure you that we did n't expect universal praise			2
the heart of race together has always been about humanity : the promise of the @entity143 should be available to every person in this country , not just a select few			0
we leaned in because we believed that starting this dialogue is what matters most			0
we are learning a lot			0
and will always aim high in our efforts to make a difference on the issues that matter most			0
i want to thank those of you who took time this week to share what you were seeing , hearing , feeling and thinking as we rolled out race together across the country			2
an issue as tough as racial and ethnic inequality requires risk - taking and tough - minded action			0
and let me reassure you that our conviction and commitment to the notion of equality and opportunity for all has never been stronger			0
take care of yourselves and each other			0
i am proud to be your partner			0
with great respect , @entity1 source : @entity2			1
