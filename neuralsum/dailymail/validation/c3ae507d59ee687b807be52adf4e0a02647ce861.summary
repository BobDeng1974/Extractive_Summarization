a woman desperate to become a mother has been refused @entity3 treatment on the @entity4 because her partner already has a child from a previous relationship			1
now , a furious @entity8 , 23 , from @entity9 in @entity10 , is taking her case to the @entity12 in an attempt to force the government to act			2
according to ms @entity8 , she never sees her boyfriend 's daughter and insists that having a child is a ' basic human right for a woman '			1
@entity20 , 23 , pictured with partner @entity21 was told as a teenager she would be unable to conceive naturally because she has polycystic ovary syndrome ' i hardly have any contact with @entity26 , ' she says of partner @entity28 's four - year - old daughter			1
' she lives with her mum and she never stays with us so i do n't understand the decision			2
' when i was 17 i was told i would get two free goes on the @entity4 and i was n't told then that anything would get in the way of that			2
' i have already been told that parliament ca n't do anything and i am willing to go to the @entity12 to get it			1
' it is a basic human right for a woman to have a child and be a mother			1
even though i love my stepdaughter , i want a baby of my own			0
' ms @entity8 ' problems began when she was a teenager and was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome which caused small cysts to grow on her ovaries , preventing her from ovulating			2
the couple read their letter informing them they can not have @entity3 on the @entity4 as @entity21 already has a child promised ivf by medics at the time , ms @entity8 thought nothing more of it until , three years after meeting mr @entity28 , 24 , she decided she wanted to start a family and requested an appointment			1
but the couple were left devastated when @entity4 officials told them they were not eligible for @entity3 because @entity21 has a child , four - year - old @entity26 , from a previous relationship			1
dr @entity65 , chief officer for the @entity66 , sent a letter telling the couple they were n't eligible			0
' the eligibility criteria states that where either partner in a couple has a living son or daughter from their relationship or any previous relationship , funding is not available through any of the @entity79 in the @entity4 across @entity10 and @entity80 , ' he wrote			2
' this is irrespective of the age or place of abode of their son or daughter			0
' the barmaid said she intends to fight the decision denying her the chance to be a mother ' it is heart - breaking that i ca n't have children and it was even more devastating when i was told i could n't have @entity3 , ' says ms @entity8			1
' @entity97 is running out because i may not be able to produce eggs in a few years ' time so i am more determined than ever to get this sorted			0
' ' it could mean a bitter double whammy as it means my mum may never be a grandmother			0
why am i being penalised for a condition that i have through no fault of my own ? ' mr @entity28 , who recently left his job as a supermarket manager , added : ' i have been with @entity108 for three years and we want a baby together			0
' they have considered going private but say they are unable to afford the Â£ 5,000 fee since mr @entity28 is unemployed and ms @entity8 works as a barmaid			1
their local @entity116 mp @entity115 is supporting them and has said he will back her battle if she takes it to @entity119			0
guidelines published by the @entity121 ( @entity121 ) state all women under 40 should have access to free ivf			0
they should be referred after two years of trying to get pregnant but if they can only have a baby using the treatment they can start immediately			0
however the guidelines are voluntary and many local @entity4 trusts impose their own conditions in a bid to cut costs .			0
