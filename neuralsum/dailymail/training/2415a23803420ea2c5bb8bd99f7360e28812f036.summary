@entity2 was a keen musician and rugby player			1
he had only been in the job for five months another colleague had filmed @entity2 being ' shaken ' as he stood on the fork of a fork lift truck as he scanned boxes ' he was to be an apprentice and have a mentor			1
he was doing five days and meant to be doing 9 - 5pm but when he left at 5pm they said he had to work 9 - 6pm			2

@entity2 was coherent even though he was in pain			1
' the inquest heard that management at the warehouse encouraged workers to use the forklifts to raise staff to scan boxes as a time - saving measure ' i was curious , i thought if he had been hit further down below he would have injuries down below			0

' @entity152 , a trained forklift truck driver who formerly worked for @entity153 , said under safety rules workers at the factory should have scanned in storage items at ground level and not be raised up on pallets			2
but he said staff including @entity2 and another apprentice were instructed to get onto the forks of the forklift trucks and be ferried along the side of the storage racks to scan boxes as a way of ' cutting corners ' in order to do the job quicker			1
mr @entity152 said : ' i just kept quiet because i did n't want to lose my job			2
the general rule of forklift trucks was that you are responsible for yourself and your colleagues around you			2
' the lifting of another person was not allowed but it was your responsibility for the safety of that person			0
' i was always driving the trucks but i never let anyone else up			0
i got told in my training that if you injure the person , you are the one who will get done and could go to jail			0
it is your duty to look after your environment			0
