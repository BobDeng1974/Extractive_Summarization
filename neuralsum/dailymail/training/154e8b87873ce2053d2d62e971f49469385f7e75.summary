by @entity0 published : 11:18 est , 9 august 2012 updated : 12:13 est , 9 august 2012 colour confusion : furniture designer @entity2 , who is colour - blind , mistook red for amber , as he approached a level crossing in @entity5 - on - @entity6 a colour - blind motorist failed to spot red flashing lights at a level crossing just moments before his car was pushed 30ft along a track by an oncoming train			1
the @entity14 car belonging to 59 - year - old furniture designer @entity15 was crushed and dragged along as the driver of the @entity18 train slammed on the brakes			1
he broke his arm in the drama			0
@entity2 said that he had not seen the warning lights as he drove up to the unmanned crossing , which had no barriers and which @entity27 mayor @entity26 had highlighted as a safety concern as far back as 2006 , when he was mp for the local area			2
the shaken driver was hauled from the mangled wreckage after firefighters cut off the car ’s roof , driver ’s door and boot to allow rescuers to clamber inside			1
he was lucky to escape the horror collision with just a fractured arm and none of the 20 passengers on board the train were harmed			1
on thursday he admitted a charge of dangerous driving following the collision close to @entity49 railway station on the outskirts of @entity5 , @entity51			1
the collision happened just hours after @entity54 officers had been standing , giving safety advice to motorists as they negotiated the same crossing			2
the man ’s car was hit by the 18:17 @entity60 to @entity62 service , which was travelling at about 20mph at the time of the impact			0
' as he approached the level crossing the light to indicate the train was approaching was on			1
however dr @entity2 failed to stop and after 37 seconds of the lights flashing he had crossed the level crossing , ' said @entity69 , prosecuting			1
' at the same moment , the train was approaching from @entity5 and struck dr @entity2 ’s vehicle , pulling it ten metres down the track and causing damage to the car , to the train and injuring dr @entity2			1
' crushed : @entity2 's @entity14 was dragged 30ft along the track when it was hit by a slow - moving train at the level crossing wreckage : firefighters work to rescue mr @entity2 following the crash on november 17 last year it was estimated that the crash had caused more than £ 80,000 pounds worth of damage and brought that stretch of the rail network to a standstill			1
some 16 trains were cancelled , four were partly cancelled and more trains were delayed with the track having to be closed for 11 hours while repair work could take place			0
bystanders said they had seen the lights flashing at the crossing as dr @entity2 ’s car approached , and thought that the @entity14 would stop , only to hear a loud bang as the train hit the moving vehicle			1
train driver @entity99 said he had slowed the train down from 50mph as he approached @entity49 station , but had not seen @entity2 ’s car as it had been in his blind spot			1
' as i was going over the crossing i heard a big bang , ' he said in a statement			0
lucky escape : the driver only suffered a broken arm and no passengers were injured after the train ploughed into @entity2 's car ' i immediately put on my brakes			1
i looked out of the window and saw a silver estate car dragged ten to 15 metres			0
' in his police interview @entity2 , who has a phd in design , said he had known there was a level crossing in the area and had been expecting to see signage to warn him of the hazard ahead			1
he had slowed down to less than 15mph in preparation , and although he had seen a single ' pulsating ' light , he did not think this was the warning light on the crossing			2
magistrates sitting in @entity129 heard that he was colour bind and had difficulty differentiating between red and amber coloured lights			0
' i ’m looking for evidence of another light to tell me it ’s a warning sign and i continued thinking " ‘ this is n’t a crossroad - it must be further down , " he told police in his statement			0
' i knew it was about 100 metres to the crossroad			0
i did n’t know exactly where the crossroad was positioned , i ’m looking for evidence that the crossroad is nearby			0
' i ’m aware there is no barrier			0
the next moment there is a crash and i have no awareness i have crossed into a train			0
' @entity154 , defending , told the court that safety concerns had been raised about the crossing as there had been several near misses in the past decade			0
he said that in october 2006 @entity26 , then mp for @entity5 , had raised a question in @entity162 calling for it to be made safer			0
safety concerns : @entity27 mayor @entity26 had highlighted the unmanned crossing , which had no barriers , in 2006 , when he was mp for @entity60 as well as a lack of safety barriers , mr @entity154 said the lights could be obscured by foliage and had been tilted away from oncoming traffic - making them difficult for @entity2 to identify in the dark			1
' this clearly does not provide a problem for local residents , but for a stranger approaching the crossing from the side dr @entity2 was approaching is hazardous , ' he said			2
he added : ' an angled light appeared to be a pulsating light			0
as the court will know , the law is clear : making a mistake is not a defence and he has pleaded guilty			2
' mr @entity154 said that since @entity2 ’s crash on november 17 , last year , safety barriers had been installed at the crossing			1
presiding magistrate @entity187 said that grey - haried @entity2 , of @entity188 in @entity51 , had been lucky not to have been killed in the crash			2
' you caused major disruption to passenger services for about 12 hours and extensive damage , ' she said to bespectacled @entity2 , who stood solemnly in the dock , smartly dressed in a shirt and tie			2
' however , no - one else was injured and your action was not deliberate			0
' she told @entity2 that he would have to pay a £ 1,500 pounds fine , as well as £ 775 pounds in court costs and a £ 15 pounds victim surcharge within the next week			2
he was also banned from driving for a year and told that he would have to sit an extended test before being allowed a new licence .			0
