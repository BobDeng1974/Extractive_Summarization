@entity0 is set to cut thousands of jobs in its biggest ever restructuring			1
the firm is believed to be planning the reorganisation as it integrates the mobile phone make @entity6 it recently bought			0
the reductions , expected to be announced as soon as this week , could be in the @entity6 unit and the parts of @entity0 that overlap with that business , as well as in marketing and engineering , @entity7 reported			1
the restructuring may end up being the biggest in @entity0 history , topping the 5,800 jobs cut in 2009 , the report said			1
since absorbing the handset business of @entity6 this spring , @entity0 has 127,000 employees , far more than rivals @entity20 and @entity22			1
@entity23 is expecting chief executive @entity24 to make major cuts , which would represent @entity0 's first major layoffs since 2009			1
the restructuring may end up being the biggest in @entity0 history , topping the 5,800 jobs cut in 2009 , the report said			1
some of the job cuts will be in marketing departments for businesses such as the global @entity33 team , and among software testers , while other job cuts may result from changes @entity24 is making to the engineering organization , @entity7 reported			1
despite the problems , @entity0 shares have climbed 13 percent so far this year			1
last week , @entity24 circulated a memo to employees promising to ' flatten the organization and develop leaner business processes ' but deferred any comment on widely expected job cuts at the software company			1
@entity24 said he would address detailed organizational and financial issues for the company 's new financial year , which started at the beginning of this month , when @entity0 reports quarterly results on july 22			1
@entity0 could not be immediately reached for comment outside regular business hours			2
a two - year slump in personal computer sales ended in the second quarter , helped by improving demand in developed markets like @entity58 and @entity59			2
pc sales have fallen in recent years , hurt by surging demand for tablets and other mobile devices			0
tough economic conditions around the world have also disrupted sales			0
but quarterly figures released wednesday by the research firms @entity69 and @entity70 show the global slump is easing			0
during the april to june quarter , @entity69 said pc shipments edged up 0.1 percent to 75.8 million units			0
@entity70 , which also tracks pc shipments , had slightly different figures			0
better sales in developed markets and interest in lower - priced @entity81 models like the @entity82 , which uses @entity22 's operating system and starts at $ 199 , helped boost results			2
@entity70 vice president @entity85 said the better - than - expected results are partly due to a rebound from weaker demand last year , and potentially short - term replacement activity			2
' we can look for some recovery in emerging regions going forward , but it may coincide with slower growth in mature regions , and we do not see the recent gains as a motive to raise the long - term outlook , ' he said in a statement			2
sales were strongest in @entity59 , the @entity101 and @entity102			0
emerging markets continued to see declines , however , hurt by weak economies and competition from low - cost tablets			0
in the @entity101 , shipments rose 6.9 percent , spurred by businesses replacing office pcs and consumers updating @entity113 systems			0
@entity0 retired the @entity113 operating system earlier this year			2
' one encouraging factor was a good intake of lower - end systems , including @entity82 , which coincides with the recent slowing in tablet growth and perhaps signals the beginning of some stabilization on the consumer side , ' said @entity123 research analyst @entity123			0
@entity70 analyst @entity124 added that strong back - to - school and holiday seasons could help the @entity101 @entity81 market stay in positive territory for the rest of the year .			0
