by @entity0 published : 07:10 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 07:56 est , 4 june 2013 covering up : new guidelines banning shopkeepers from displaying lingerie and skimpy clothing on mannequins outside shops could be passed in @entity7 mannequins displaying lingerie could be banned in @entity7 in a bid to halt @entity11 's rape epidemic			1
@entity7 's municipal council passed a resolution barring stores from displaying scantily - clad mannequins outside city shops			1
the ruling will come into effect if it is approved by the muncipal commissioner			2
it comes as news emerged that two western women were raped in @entity11 in the last two days			1
a 30 - year - old @entity24 tourist was gang - raped by three men while hitchhiking back to a guest house in the northern resort of @entity28 this morning			2
the attack came just a day after it emerged that a a 21 - year - old @entity31 charity worker was allegedly drugged and raped while volunteering with an aid agency in @entity33			2
they are the latest in a spate of sexual assaults on foreign women in @entity11 that have led to safety warnings and a drop in the number of female tourists travelling to the country			1
the resolution to ban mannequins wearing lingerie was suggested by city councillor @entity47 who said that such displays not only degrade women but could also encourage men to attack them			1
she said : ' such people get provoked by mannequins			0
after all , a mannequin is a replica of a woman 's body			0
that 's why i oppose it , because mannequins do not suit @entity11 culture			1
' although the ruling will ban mannequins from going on display outside shops , retailers will still be able to display them how they wish inside stores			1
business officials have criticised the proposals , saying that they will have no impact on violence against women			0
on show : shopkeepers will still be able to display mannequins however they wish inside the store according to the new proposals ( file picture ) @entity79 , president of the @entity80 , said : ' we are living in the 21st century where these kinds of things , all porn , the movies , the pictures , all these things are available on websites , available on mobiles			1
( a ) mannequin hardly makes any difference to the people			0
' but @entity47 said pornographic internet images are very different than the mannequins			0
she said : ' if someone wants to watch pornography on the net , that is a conscious choice that he is making			0
in this case , the mannequins are everywhere and people do n't have a choice			0
calls for protection : the gang rape and murder of a student in @entity108 sparked widespread protest in @entity11 back in december ' they run into them when they step out of their homes and walk on the streets			2
' @entity11 have increasingly demanded stronger protection for women since the gang rape and killing of a student on a bus in the capital of @entity108 in december			1
that rape sparked public protests demanding better protection for women			0
in response , the government passed a law increasing prison terms for rape and providing for the death penalty in cases of rape that result in death or leave the victim in a coma			0
it also made voyeurism , stalking , acid attacks and the trafficking of women punishable under criminal law .			0
