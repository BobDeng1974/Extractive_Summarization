by @entity0 published : 06:05 est , 24 september 2013 updated : 08:08 est , 24 september 2013 for the past decade , scientists studying radiation left after the @entity3 have suspected that our universe is lopsided			1
now , cosmologists in @entity7 believe the data actually shows that the universe is curved in a saddle - like shape			1
if their theory is correct , it could overturn long - held views that anything travelling through spacetime does so in straight lines along a flat universe			1
@entity19 's skymap shows that one half of the microwave background is brighter than the other , and the universe has a large cold spot			0
scientists believe this provides evidence that the universe is curved the study , reported by @entity30 on @entity31 , suggests that in a saddle - shaped universe , objects travelling in parallel with eventually veer away from each other at huge distances			2
changes in the light emitted when the @entity38 was just 400,000 years old - also known as the cosmic microwave background - have helped scientists understand the structure and evolution of the universe			2
measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( @entity46 ) by @entity48 ’s @entity47 provided the first clues of a lopsided universe in 2004			1
@entity48 's 2004 results on radiation after the @entity3 were later confirmed by the @entity53 ¿ s @entity19 ( pictured ) , which mapped it with greater precision cosmic background radiation ( @entity46 ) fills the universe in every direction			1
it is the afterglow of the big bang streaming through space these last 14 billion years			0
it the oldest light we can see and the farthest back both in time and space that we can look changes in the light emitted when the @entity38 was just 400,000 years old could helped scientists understand the structure and evolution of the universe			0
the results were later confirmed by the @entity53 ’s @entity19 spacecraft , which mapped the @entity46 with greater precision			0
@entity75 ’s @entity74 and @entity76 believe that the results can be explained by a theory that suggests the universe formed like a bubble inside a larger universe , triggering fluctuations that caused the curved - shaped			1
‘ the observed anomalies in the cosmic microwave background are intriguing — they may just be a statistical fluke , but they might be an indication of new physical processes at play in the early universe , ’ researcher @entity74 told @entity31			0
the curved shape contradicts the view that moments after the @entity3 , the universe grew massively in size , causing the universe to even out in every direction			2
next year , the @entity53 hopes its @entity19 satellite will reveal whether the anomaly in @entity46 data was a fluke by releasing its most detailed analysis yet			0
the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation fluctuates more on one side of the sky ( the right side of this image ) than on the other , a sign that space might be curved			0

radiation left after @entity3 gave first clues of a lopsided universe in 2004
@entity75 now *claims* data is more *consistent* with it being ' curved '
if the latest theory is correct , it could overturn long - held views that anything travelling through spacetime does so in straight lines
