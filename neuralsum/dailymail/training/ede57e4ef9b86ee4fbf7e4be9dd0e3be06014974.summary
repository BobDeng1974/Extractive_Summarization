the @entity0 has overturned the will of a deceased man who left his entire estate to a hospital after being convinced that his children were not biologically his own			1
a total of $ 1.8 million worth of estate was left to the @entity8 by the man , who died in june 2012 and was also known to have repeatedly accused his neighbour of poisoning his plants , according to the @entity0 judgement			1
after one of his daughters challenged the will , the court heard that the father - of - three who emigrated from @entity19 , was often ' aggressive ' and ' hysterical ' and suffered from a ' delusional illness ' which worsened from 1998 onwards			0
the @entity21 overturned the will of a deceased man who left his entire estate to a hospital his children recounted to justice @entity24 how the 82 - year - old often accused his wife of being unfaithful to him and on one occasion , alleged she had been a prostitute and engaged in incest			1
in 2000 , the judgement records that his wife underwent a lie detector test at the man 's insistence , which she passed			1
' the deceased said that these results indicated that the person that administered the test was either @entity39 or @entity40 , and falsified the results of the test as a sign of ethnic unity with his wife , who was born in @entity40 , ' @entity33 revealed in his final decision			2
he had also requested toothbrushes and hair samples from his children on several occasions , before claiming they would be used in dna sample tests to prove that they were not his biological offspring			0

in the ruling published earlier this month , @entity33 wrote that while , ' the deceased 's will , on its face , appears to be properly executed ' the evidence presented ' raises a suspicion that the deceased suffered from delusions at the time that he made the alleged will , and that these delusions influenced his testamentary intentions '			0
a settlement was reached between the hospital and the man 's children that would see only $ 200,000 remain with the @entity8 while $ 85,000 was awarded to his granddaughter and the remainder split between his three children			2

the @entity92 man left his entire estate to the @entity8 , a judgement *recalls*
his children challenged the will and were awarded the *majority* of his estate in a settlement *approved* by the @entity0 earlier this month
they said their father often claimed his wife had been unfaithful to him and that his children were not biologically his own
in 2000 , he had submitted his wife to a lie detector test which , when she passed , he claimed had been *tampered* with by a ' @entity39 or @entity40 '
