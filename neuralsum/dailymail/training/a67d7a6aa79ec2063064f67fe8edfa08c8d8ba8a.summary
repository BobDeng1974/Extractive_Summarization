by @entity0 whose clothes are you 're lusting after this week ? @entity5 's coat ? @entity7 's cape ? @entity8 of @entity10 's clutch ? or a pair of ankle boots worn by the girl sitting opposite you on the eastbound district line ? well , lust no more			0
a team of technology whizz - kids at a company based at @entity20 , @entity21 , are developing a fashion - finding app enabling users to ' @entity25 ' outfits by taking photos of them , whereupon they will be shown a selection of options for buying the same or similar items			1
the find similar service has been created by the team at @entity32 , a leading provider of visual search and image recognition technology for mobile devices , based in @entity37			1
dress like a @entity8 : a team of internet whizz - kids at a company based at @entity20 , @entity21 , are developing fashion - finding technology to enable users to dress like their idols the technology allows you to find items of clothing that are similar in style to that which appears on your camera , meaning you no longer have to trawl the internet and play detective when you want to find out where @entity55 got her dress or @entity58 her scarf			1
@entity61 spokesman @entity60 told @entity62 : ' the company is four years old , and before that we did seven years of research at @entity20			1
@entity67 at @entity20 figured out the technology			0
' when we started the company we were doing a lot of work in the grocery sector , with companies like @entity75 - technology that enabled you to take photos of items in your fridge and find the exact match online			1
but that was exact matches , and over the year we developed an evolution of that : find similar			1
' the company soon realised that the best application for their new technology was fashion , ' because it 's so difficult to describe items of clothing things in words and search for them on the internet '			2
' but if you show someone a picture ' , continued @entity60 , ' you can see exactly what they 're talking about			0
' he continued : ' where colour , pattern and texture are involved find similar is very good			1
so you can enter photographs of friends , celebrities , magazines , and the database will hunt for similar matches , and find the exact one if it 's there			2
' the bigger the database the better the matches , so we 're currently talking to some very big retailers who have lots of images			0
and hopefully we 'll be helping people			0
' like @entity7 's dress ? the new technology will bring up options for similar dresses , most of which will be more within the budget of the average non-model the @entity129 team - who describe themselves as ' the engine behind the scenes ' - are taking their technology to people who run apps and websites where there might be an application for it			0
they said : ' the application of this technology is set to revolutionise the online and mobile fashion marketplace			0
' with it , retailers and major brand - owners are enabling their customers to start their individual searches for clothing or accessories - by just by taking a picture			0
' they continued : ' @entity152 is all about style , image and inspiration			0
either from magazines pictures , street - style images , photos of friends ' outfits or specific shop window styles you may see in the high street			0
' @entity32 's find similar mobile image search gives you the opportunity to be inspired by what you see around you just by taking a picture and asking the system to find what you are looking for			1
' finding items could n't be simpler , as traditional text based search or drop down category specific menu searches will never uncover what you are looking for			2
' @entity129 's development follows rumours in april that @entity25 - the @entity180 mobile phone music identification service - were developing a similar app. be a @entity182 : @entity184 's style can now be completely your own , as by using the technology you can find similar items of clothing just by taking a photograph a spokesman for @entity25 told @entity62 : ' @entity25 is not working on a new app for fashion			1
but , we currently have a merchandising feature incorporated in our television tag result - when you use @entity25 to tag any show on 160 channels in the @entity198 , you can get information on the cast and show , including trivia , music in the broadcast , cast listing , etc. ' currently , that merchandising feature lets people buy show - related items , which sometimes includes clothing similar to that which is featured in the program			1
our executive chair @entity212 was referring to our plans to continue innovating around that feature , which is already in play			0
' having said that , fashion houses could quite easily work with @entity25 to make their catwalk shows @entity25 - enabled			0
' in fact , right after the clothes featured in catwalk shows , the music is the next thing that people talk about - and @entity25 is frequently mentioned in @entity224 , @entity225 and other top tier fashion magazines			2
' fashion houses could partner with @entity25 to incorporate information about their new line or other products so that when people use @entity25 to tag the music in the show , they are able to browse the styles they see or view scents , accessories or other items			2
' mad for the @entity5 : get your hands on all of @entity5 's looks with @entity61 's new fashion - hunting technology that links you to similar items listen up : @entity25 have denied rumours they too are developing an app specifically for locating fashion items , though a version of the service is available in @entity249 via their tv ' tagging ' function ' shazam it ' : @entity25 allows you to identify music and even objects - including furniture and clothes - in tv shows			1
