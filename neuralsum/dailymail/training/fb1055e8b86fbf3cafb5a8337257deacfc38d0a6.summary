by @entity0 chemicals found in make - up , hairspray and food packaging are causing women to hit the menopause early , researchers warn			1
those exposed to high doses have been found to go through the change almost two and a half years before other women			2
and in some cases , these chemicals may be causing women to stop having periods 15 years too soon , say scientists			2
bad for your health ? : researchers believe pthalates - chemicals found in cosmetics - may bring on early menopause there is already is widespread concern over the potential health risks of pthalates , a group of chemicals found in plastics , cosmetics , household products and food packaging			1
recent studies have shown they may increase the risk of cancer , diabetes and obesity and there is even evidence they may feminise the brains of young boys			1
now @entity44 researchers say the chemicals are disrupting women ’s reproductive systems , including their ovaries , and leading to early menopause			1
dr @entity49 , from @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity52 , and colleagues looked at the levels of pthalates in the blood or urine of 5,700 women			1
long - term impact : pthalates have previously been linked to increased risks of cancer , diabetes and obesity those with the highest amounts were found to have gone through the menopause an average of 2.3 years before the others			1
the typical age of the menopause is 51 , so women exposed to the highest levels were hitting it aged 49			2
but dr @entity49 told the @entity74 ’s conference in @entity75 , @entity76 , that some women may be going through the menopause 15 years early , in their mid-thirties			2
an early menopause is linked to far higher rates of strokes , heart disease , bone problems and fatal brain haemorrhages			1
dr @entity49 said : ‘ we do n’t know yet if some of them are going through it one year earlier or some are going through it 15 years earlier			0
‘ early menopause has a lot of impact on your health			1
we absolutely think these chemicals have the potential to affect ovarian function and human reproduction			0
‘ there ’s a lot that we do n’t know at this point , our research is still preliminary , but it ’s enough to suggest it is having a detrimental impact in the long term			0
’ she could not explain why some women were exposed to higher levels of these chemicals			0
it may be that they wore more make - up , drank bottled water or ate more packaged foods			0
but @entity118 experts urged women not to worry themselves unnecessarily			0
professor @entity120 , who specialises in reproductive health at the @entity122 said : ‘ my concern is not high at this stage			0
phthalate exposure is ubiquitous and thus impossible to avoid altogether			0
‘ eating fresh , unpackaged food can reduce phthalate exposure but will not eliminate it			0

a group of chemicals known as pthalates are already thought to raise the risk of cancer , diabetes and obesity
researchers at @entity50 , @entity52 , believe they may also cause early menopause
chemicals are found in plastics , cosmetics , household products and food packaging
