what drove his actions was a strong moral compass			0

prosecutors portrayed @entity4 as ' the determined insider , ' an anarchist hacker and traitor who started working within weeks of his 2009 deployment to provide @entity19 and its founder @entity313 with exactly what they wanted			1
but @entity4 and her defense team maintain she was an idealistic soldier with a pure motive - to expose brutal truths about @entity320 's military and diplomatic corps			1
