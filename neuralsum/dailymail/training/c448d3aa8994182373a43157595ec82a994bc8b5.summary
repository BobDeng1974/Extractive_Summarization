@entity0 already offers storage for your emails , photos and documents			1
now , it wants to take things a step further - and store your genetic information online			2
the firm hopes its @entity12 project will lead to personalised drugs - and will charge just £ 25 per person to store data on its servers			1
' this means allowing researchers to access millions of genomes and run batch analyses , easily			2
it hopes the service will be popular with hospitals , drug firms and researchers will use the service , taking advantage of @entity0 's vast servers to compare information and find the cause of disease			1
' we saw biologists moving from studying one genome at a time to studying millions , ' @entity36 , the software engineer who led the effort and was previously head of platform engineering for @entity40 , the social network , told @entity45			0
' the opportunity is how to apply breakthroughs in data technology to help with this transition			0
' the goal of the system , @entity0 says , is to ' explore genetic variation interactively			2
' ' use @entity0 's infrastructure and big data expertise , ' it said			1
' store one genome or a million using @entity56 and take advantage of the same infrastructure that powers @entity59 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64			0
' this means allowing researchers to access millions of genomes and run batch analyses , easily			0
the @entity69 said last month that it would pay $ 19 million to move copies of the 2.6 petabyte @entity71 into the cloud			1
the @entity69 said last month that it would pay $ 19 million to move copies of the 2.6 petabyte @entity71 into the cloud			1
copies of the data , from several thousand cancer patients , will reside both at @entity56 and in @entity79 ’s data centers			0
doctors also say the move coule lead to more personalised medicines			0
' our bird 's eye view is that if i were to get lung cancer in the future , doctors are going to sequence my genome and my tumor 's genome , and then query them against a database of 50 million other genomes , ' said @entity96 , whose company , @entity98 , stores genome data with @entity79 's cloud system			0
' the result will be ' hey , here 's the drug that will work best for you			2

search giant hopes service will be popular with drug firms and researchers
can use @entity0 's vast servers to compare information
