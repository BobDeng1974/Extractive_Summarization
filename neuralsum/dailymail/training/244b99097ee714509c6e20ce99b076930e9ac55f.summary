by @entity0 study : academics say children could be refusing to eat their greens because of a survival instinct children who do n't eat their vegetables may be using their inherited survival instinct , a study has shown			1
dr @entity10 and dr @entity11 , both psychologists at @entity14 's @entity13 , wrote the study on how children behave around plants			1
the academics studied toddlers playing with different objects and realised youngsters did n't pick up natural things , like plants , as much as they played with plastic or metal objects			1
at the @entity27 at @entity13 , 47 eight to 18 - month - old children were observed and the psychologists who put them in front of two real plants , two realistic - looking artificial plants , and two other objects			1
the children in the experiment showed a ' striking reluctance ' to touch plants , the doctors noted			1
they believe this behaviour is progammed into children from birth to avoid them being harmed or poisoned by flowers or plants			1
' this behavioral strategy would protect infants from the dangers posed by plants by decreasing the likelihood of ingesting plant toxins ( by either consuming plant parts or ingesting toxins rubbed off on their hands from damaged plant parts ) , or incurring injuries from plants ’ physi cal defenses ( e.g. , fine hairs , thorns , or noxious oils )			2
the same findings can translate to the frustrations many parents face when trying to get their toddlers to eat fruit and vegetables , the psychologists say			0
explaining the findings , the report says : ' in modern @entity70 circumstances , plants are often peripheral to daily life			2
they may be encountered only in well - manicured lawns and parks , or as already - harvested fruits and vegetables in the grocery store			2
' throughout human evolution , plants have been essential to human existence			0
' yet , for all of these benefits , plants have always posed very real dangers			0
' academics : dr @entity10 ( left ) and dr @entity11 ( right ) carried out the study the study says that defence and survival mechanisms , teaching humans not to grab dangerous plants , could be why children are reluctant to eat leafy , green vegetables			1
' plants produce toxins as defenses against predators that can be harmful , or even deadly , if ingested , ' the paper continues , ' the costs associated with plant defenses have shaped the physiology and behavior of many non-human animal species			0
' however , the built - in reluctance could be changed , they said			2
' the current results suggest that human infants , like other non-human animals , possess strategies for mitigating the ancestrally recurrent dangers posed by plants			0
' we suspect that this initial avoidance may be a default strategy that can be overturned by social information indicating that a given plant is safe to eat or use for some other purpose			0
' we are not suggesting that infants are actively afraid of plants			0
rather we propose that once infants identify an object as a plant , they deploy a behavioral strategy of inhibited manual exploration , which serves to help protect them from plants ’ potential dangers			0
' vegetables : the study says that defence and survival mechanisms , teaching humans not to grab dangerous plants , could be why children are reluctant to eat leafy , green vegetables			1

dr @entity10 and dr @entity11 carried out the study at @entity13
47 eight to 18 - month - olds tested with plants and man - made objects
children showed ' striking reluctance ' to touch plants
