@entity1 head coach @entity0 pointed an accusing finger at his own team after they let 10 - man @entity5 battle back to grab a 2 - 2 draw at the @entity7			1
the result leaves @entity1 without a win in seven games and six points off the top two but @entity0 admitted his players only had themselves to blame for the latest setback			2
@entity1 had been in control until @entity16 fired them ahead in the 23rd minute after @entity17 lost the ball out on the right but a mistake by @entity22 just before half - time changed the game			1
@entity0 ( left ) screams from the touchline as his @entity1 side look to strengthen their promotion charge @entity27 watches on as his strike flies into the bottom corner to put @entity1 2 - 1 up against @entity5 @entity30 ( left ) is joined by team - mate and captain @entity31 ( right ) after making the score 2 - 2 on friday @entity27 put @entity34 in and @entity36 's wild challenge saw him red - carded before @entity37 coolly drove the penalty into the top right corner			1
when @entity27 burst into the box and turned one way and then the other before bending the ball low past @entity45 in the 57th minute , it looked bleak for @entity5 but they hit back when @entity46 cleverly played in @entity30 to beat @entity47 from 12 yards in the 75th minute			1
@entity37 was denied by the legs of @entity45 two minutes later and the keeper leapt to tip over a @entity51 header in the final seconds of stoppage time but @entity0 knew a great chance had already slipped away			2
' we are 2 - 1 up and i think the plan is going great and then we stopped , ' he said			1
' we started to get negative and think the game was won and that 's the disappointment			0
' we have to be ruthless , we have to go for the third and fourth and kill teams off but we played as if it was the last two minutes of the game and just tried to keep the ball and they were never going to accept that			0
' it 's very frustrating for everyone but we only have ourselves to blame for not taking advantage and not winning that game and getting back in the race			0
' i said at half - time we need three goals to win this game , we got the second and i thought we would go on but we did n't go on			2
there 's anger and frustration but we 've got six games to go and we ca n't feel sorry for ourselves			0
' we 've got to react and use the anger and make sure on monday that we are more ruthless because the performances are still good but we are conceding bad goals			0
' @entity5 head coach @entity79 was ' proud ' of the way his team responded to move to within a point of the top two			1
@entity16 ( left ) smiles to the crowd after putting @entity5 1 - 0 up with his fifth goal in seven matches @entity37 slotted the penalty past @entity45 in the @entity5 goal to level the scores at 1 - 1 @entity5 boss @entity79 was proud of his team 's fight in the 2 - 2 draw against @entity1 he said : ' i am proud because we believed we could change the situation , which is good news with six games in front of us			1
' we must be brave and believe in our possibilities			0
i am always confident in my team because if the players play with confidence , they believe they are a good team and can change the situation in the second half			0
' in my opinion ( @entity36 's foul ) was not enough for a sending - off but the referee has another opinion and that 's it			2
derby play good football but my team play good football too			0
