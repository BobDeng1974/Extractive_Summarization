by @entity0 published : 07:16 est , 11 march 2013 updated : 08:05 est , 11 march 2013 a salesman from the firm behind last year 's devastating outbreak of meningitis has revealed how the lab made up prescriptions for fake customers in order to maximise its profits			1
@entity10 , where the fungal disease which has killed 48 originated , was only supposed to manufacture drugs for individuals as it was not regulated by federal officials			1
to get round the ban on large - scale production , clinics requested prescriptions with invented names such as ' @entity20 ' , ' @entity21 ' and even ' @entity22 '			1
another worker claims he warned his boss that ' something 's going to happen ' just a month before the first of the firm 's patients died from meningitis , but was totally ignored			1
all those affected had been treated with drugs from @entity38 , which was not regulated by the @entity47 as it was only licenced to compound drugs for specific individuals on receipt of a prescription			1
but a salesman for the firm told @entity55 's @entity54 that the company was in fact acting as a drug manufacturer , and claimed that it had as many as 3,000 clients despite presenting itself as a ' mom and pop specialty pharmacy '			2
in order to circumvent the ban on large - scale manufacture , clinics would allegedly submit prescriptions under fake names and pretend these were their patients			1
outbreak : drugs mixed by the firm have been linked to a recent epidemic of fungal meningitis ' @entity77 , @entity22 - those ones did raise red flags , and we would call our client back , and say , " hey , give us different names , " ' the unnamed salesman said			1
' the follow - up names would be like a @entity84 , @entity21 , @entity85 - you know , @entity87 , @entity20			2
' when @entity38 staff continued to object , he said , ' sometimes [ clients ] would take a phone directory within their office , and scribble out their extensions , and fax it over to us			0
' he added that the company employed 30 sales representatives , but claimed that when inspectors visited its headquarters the sales team was told to stay away so as not to raise suspicions			0
@entity101 , a former technician at @entity102 where much of the contaminated material was made up , said that a year before the meningitis outbreak the firm started to increase its output by up to 1,000 times			1
' we became a manufacturer overnight , ' he told 60 minutes			0
' so we were basically trying to have the best of both worlds			0
it was trying to manufacture without the oversight of a manufacturer			0
' product : pictured are the vials of the injectable steroid used to treat back pain made by @entity10 implicated in the fungal meningitis outbreak he said that technicians had found mould in the laboratory around a dozen times in the three years leading up to the start of the scandal			1
according to mr @entity32 , late last summer he approached his supervisor and said : ' something 's going to happen			0
something 's going to get missed			0
and we 're going to get shut down			0
' he apparently expressed concerns the lab 's products would ' hurt a patient ' - but his worries were ignored by management			2
in september , patients who had been treated with methylprednisolone acetate originating from @entity38 began to fall ill with meningitis			2
the firm was rapidly shut down by the @entity142 , and has now gone out of business			0
owner @entity144 has refused to comment on the allegations made by 60 minutes , and invoked the @entity146 to avoid testifying to @entity147			0

drugs from @entity10 contaminated with fungus
firm was only allowed to make *medicines* for individuals , so clinics ' submitted fake names on prescriptions '
technician claims he warned bosses firm would soon ' hurt a patient '
48 people have died and *hundreds* in hospital from fungal meningitis
