by @entity0 they say a girl should be able to depend on her daddy and luckily for one beauty therapist from @entity5 that old adage was true			0
when @entity7 became so fed up of being overweight she borrowed £ 10,000 from the bank of dad and went on to lose 9st after paying for a gastric sleeve operation			1
despite previous attempts at dieting @entity7 had seen her weight balloon to 18st , requiring her to wear size 22 clothing			1
having being told she was ineligible for @entity28 funding she decided to pay for the operation to be done privately with money loaned to her from her supportive father			1
miss @entity7 said : ' my weight had got to the point where i was constantly feeling as if i did n't have any energy , and i was always unwell			1
i had taken to staying in , afraid of getting out and being active			0
' one night i broke down and told my dad how depressed i was getting , and how i was thinking about surgery			1
he believed in me , and said i could lose weight purely through dieting			1
but when he saw i was serious about it , he did some reading into it and decided to come with me to a consultation			2
' deeply unhappy with her weight , @entity46 decided that weight loss surgery was the best option ( left before , right , recently ) miss @entity7 saw her weight pile on as she fell into a cycle of comfort food and convenience @entity54 said : ' i began gaining weight after the age of 16			1
i led a fairly hectic social life when i started going to college , and often it was easier to routinely grab time - saving food like pizza and takeaways			2
' as my weight increased i became less energetic , and hid myself away , which led to comfort eating , so my weight just became more and more of an issue			2
' by 2012 , miss @entity7 was at her heaviest weight of 18st			1
she said : ' i was very upset about it			0
i did n't want to give in to the idea that i would be overweight forever , but despite dieting i just could n't seem to do anything about it			0
one night everything came to a head and i told my dad about it			2
' a week later he came back to say he had been doing some research and suggested we go to a consultation together to see what options we had			0
' the operation required miss @entity7 to completely overhaul her daily diet , eliminating junk food miss @entity7 was told she would not be eligible for @entity28 funding , but discovered that a gastric sleeve procedure could be arranged privately			1
her father @entity83 , 53 , eventually put the money up for the operation			1
@entity7 has no regrets about the operation and says her weight loss has given her her confidence back she said : ' i did n't know whether it was going to happen or not , because £ 10,000 seemed like an awful lot of money , but dad said he would help			1
' following the operation on january 10th 2013 , miss @entity7 lost 3st in six weeks			1
she said : ' i was so nervous before the operation because i had never done anything like it			2
i was in loads of pain after i woke up			0
' it was great to see the results at the six - week check - up because i was n't sure how effective the operation was going to be			2
as it turned out the effect it had was amazing			2
' the operation required miss @entity7 to completely overhaul her daily diet			1
before the operation , she typically ate nothing for breakfast , followed by a packet of prawn cocktail crisps mid-morning , then a portion of cheese and chips or a burger for lunch , with a cheese and onion pizza or @entity122 takeaway for evening meal			2
she would snack on crisps or @entity126 chocolate during the day			0
today , she eats @entity128 cereal with yogurt for breakfast , followed by soup with a small chunk of bread for lunch , and chicken stir fry for evening meal			0
she rarely snacks , but when she does she enjoys a small portion of soft cheese			0
miss @entity7 is now a healthy 9st and can fit into size 10 clothing			1
she said : ' i 've regained my confidence , and i love going shopping now			0
in my old life , i could n't afford to buy clothes because i was spending so much on takeaways			0
' it 's taken some getting used to , and it has n't been easy at times			0
i need to be careful to keep my protein levels up			0
i have no regrets whatsoever			0
' @entity151 's really pleased with the progress i 've made			0

diet of junk food saw @entity7 's weight steadily rise , *denting* her confidence
deeply unhappy she decided surgery was necessary to address her size
was told she was not eligible for @entity28 funding and so turned to her father
he lent her the £ 10,000 to have the operation done privately
@entity7 dropped from 18st and size 22 to a slim 9st and size 10
