@entity0 admits he does not know how impending fatherhood will impact on his performance at the @entity3			1
the world number one and new wife @entity5 are expecting their first child in october			1
they married in @entity9 a few days after @entity0 defeated @entity10 to win @entity11 , and initial indications suggest the @entity13 will struggle to play his best tennis			1
he was a shadow of the player that won his seventh grand slam title on @entity19 last month as he suffered early defeats in the @entity22 tournaments in @entity23 and @entity24			2
father figure : @entity0 admits that he 's unsure how fatherhood will have an impact on tennis @entity0 has been seeking advice from coach @entity30 about how to cope with the competing responsibilities in his life as he prepares to begin his @entity34 campaign against @entity36 's @entity35			1
the 27 - year - old said : ' a lot of things happened in the last two months , and it was a very emotional period			2
i just felt a bit flat on the court			2
i was n't managing to find that intensity and the perfect mindset			2
' but it 's all normal			2
it 's something that i 'm experiencing for the first time			2
so i 'm trying to talk as much as i can to first of all my coach that has been through similar experiences in his life more than one time			0
i 'm trying to get as much information as i can			0
champion : @entity0 kissing the @entity11 trophy after his five - set victory over @entity10 ' i have only positive and joyful feelings ( about ) approaching fatherhood , and hopefully it 's going to happen in less than two months			1
then i 'm going to enjoy it and try to take as much energy as i can , positive energy to the tennis court			0
' but without a doubt , life changes			0
my priorities are my family , my wife , my future kid			1
tennis is definitely not number one any more			2
' @entity0 has reached the @entity3 final in each of the last four years , beating @entity73 in 2011 but losing to the @entity74 last year and in 2010 , and also to @entity75 two years ago			1
hungry : @entity0 goes into the @entity3 as the favourite for the tournament after @entity73 pulled out with @entity73 missing as he nurses a wrist injury , @entity0 goes into the tournament as favourite , and his expectations remain high			1
he said : ' i 'm feeling better and better as the days go by			0
it 's something that is encouraging me for this year 's @entity3 campaign			1
' obviously i want to peak with my form at the @entity3			1
yes , i wanted to do better in @entity87 and @entity24			0
unfortunately i was n't even close to my best			0
friendly : @entity0 laughing with @entity89 at the @entity90 ' i have high expectations for myself			1
especially at this stage of my career where i feel like now is the time that i 'm at my peak physical strength			0
i want to use this time of my career as much as i can to win as many matches as possible			0
' obviously i know i 'm not the only one that has this kind of optimistic mindset			0
there are many players who are fighting for the same trophy			0
this is the last @entity106 of the year , and this is where you want to play your best			0
' the absence of @entity73 coupled with doubts over the form of @entity0 and @entity75 makes this potentially the most open grand slam in years , although @entity10 is in ominous form			1
@entity114 and @entity115 are leading the next generation 's push to break into the grand slam winners ' circle , and both will fancy their chances here			0
' when @entity73 is not around it changes because he always has been a favourite in every grand slam for the last seven , eight , 10 years , ' said @entity0			1
' definitely the tournament and tennis is losing when they do n't have @entity73 in the tournament			1
' i know that there is one thing for sure : everybody is starting from scratch			0
' @entity133 cruises through in @entity134			0
