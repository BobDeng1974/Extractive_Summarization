by @entity0 published : 16:10 est , 31 august 2012 updated : 19:39 est , 31 august 2012 barred : former home secretary @entity1 was prevented from taking his seat at the @entity4 opening ceremony because he was with his guide dog @entity6 it is the world ’s biggest showcase of equality for the disabled			1
but that did n’t help @entity1 when he arrived at the @entity12 opening ceremony with his guide dog			1
the former home secretary , who has been blind since birth , was unable to take his seat because he had his dog in tow			1
mr @entity1 was shocked and angry after a ‘ stroppy and insensitive ’ @entity20 official refused to let him sit in his allocated spot			1
after a frank exchange , a makeshift seat was eventually arranged for the @entity25 mp on an ‘ exposed , blustery gantry ’ for the three - and - a - half hour show			1
mr @entity1 , 65 , one of the country ’s most high - profile guide dog users , decided not to ‘ have a hissy fit ’ , insisting he did not want to detract from the spirit of the @entity12 and its ‘ demonstration of equality of opportunity ’			1
but he has now spoken out to ensure that others with guide dogs do not endure the same humiliation			1
he told the @entity38 : ‘ this is n’t just about me			2
this is about getting it right			0
‘ i want @entity20 organisers to learn a lesson for the future so that people with guide dogs can be treated as equals			2
’ mr @entity1 said he had to ‘ bite his lip ’ after he was told that his seat was unsuitable for assistance dog @entity6 , a black curly - coated retriever cross			1
he said that up until that point , games officials and volunteers had treated him with the utmost respect – but things changed when he tried to take his seat			2
he added : ‘ what happened highlights how far we still have to go in changing attitudes towards the challenges faced by people with disabilities			0
’ the married father - of - three , a lifelong campaigner for guide dog users , said that he has since had ‘ very strong words ’ with @entity66 , the chairman of the organising committee for @entity68			1
mr @entity1 said that on the night in question , he had been invited as a guest of @entity71 , and games organisers @entity73 knew he was coming			1
shocked : politician @entity1 , pictured with his two guide dogs @entity6 and @entity75 , campaigns for equal rights for guide dog users flaw : much of the seating in the @entity81 is not guide dog friendly he went on : ‘ they should presume that because i ca n’t see , i will bring a guide dog as it gives me independence when getting about the park and stadium			1
‘ as i walked to my seat , an official said “ sorry , you ca n’t take your dog down there			1
” so i asked why not , and he said , “ it ’s just not suitable			0
” i said that was his judgment not mine , and asked why we did n’t make a decision together instead ? ‘ that was the point when the official got quite stroppy			2
he said to me , “ you are not taking your dog down there			2
we will find you different seats			0
” i had to draw a breath and decide whether or not to have a hissy fit			0
‘ i would have done on a different occasion , but i bit my tongue			0
as a high - profile guide dog user , i very rarely have a problem			1
‘ it was quite novel actually , as usually i am taking up the cause for other people who have suffered prejudice or discrimination by having their dogs refused entry to taxis and restaurants			0
i have n’t had a problem for many , many years , which is why i find it quite shocking			0
’ he added that wednesday ’s experience was ‘ an indication of just how insensitive some individuals can be ’ and believes that instead of a flat refusal , the official should have discussed the situation with him			2
he added : ‘ after a while , they magicked up some chairs and said we could sit on those			0
but it was behind the tv cameras and was very exposed and windy			2
it was n’t what we had envisaged at all			0
‘ before we walked into the stadium , we had been treated very well			0
i can not fault it			0
it is such a pity that it happened			0
’ ironic : mr @entity1 says he was forced to sit in a ' blustery gantry ' because his seat was unsuitable for a guide dog fellow guests : @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , the @entity151 , prince @entity152 and @entity153 were also present at the opening ceremony high profile : the @entity4 opening ceremony , watched by 11.2million people , is meant to act as a showcase of equality for the disabled flying the flag : the @entity12 , expected to be the most well - attended since the event began , meant to promote equality remarkable : @entity165 @entity164 competes in the @entity12 by holding the bow between his toes and using a harness on his shoulder to pull back the arrow true grit : @entity173 's @entity172 , who has no arms , grips a towel between her teeth so she can launch herself into the pool at the @entity178 @entity179 , chief executive of @entity180 , said he was ‘ extremely disappointed ’ to hear about mr @entity1 ’s treatment			1
he added : ‘ we have worked hard to help @entity73 to ensure that both the @entity183 and paralympics are fully accessible to blind and partially - sighted people			0
‘ this has included detailed briefings and guidance on accessibility requirements for blind people as well as providing our sighted guide training to around @entity20 mobility volunteers			0
’ last night @entity73 would not comment in detail on the incident and did not clarify its policy on guide dogs in @entity4 venues			1
a spokesman said : ‘ we are aware of the issue and we are looking into the circumstances			0

former home secretary @entity1 was invited to the @entity4 opening ceremony as a guest of @entity71
but when mr @entity1 arrived , he was told he could *n't* take his seat because he was with his guide dog @entity6
an official then gave him *alternative* seating in an ' exposed , blustery gantry '
