by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 12:13 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 12:17 est , 3 october 2012 president @entity3 and governor @entity4 have spent millions defining themselves to the @entity7 public using campaign ads. now a new poll defines the elusive undecided voter : these elusive citizens are more likely to be female , white , lacking a college education and earning less than $ 25,000			1
according to @entity16 / @entity15 polling data accumulated over the course of 2012 , the ' undecideds ' make up roughly 6 per cent of the electorate			1
key voters : a new @entity16 poll highlights demographic trends in undecided voters , which some analysts say likens them to ' @entity25 moms ' because the are mostly female who earn less than $ 25,000 given demographics , there is a slightly higher concentration of said voters in an @entity31 including @entity32 and @entity33 , swing states that could determine the outcome of a close election			1
even though such voters are expensive to win over and perhaps less likely to make it to the polls , they continue to capture the attention of campaigns and political analysts for their potential to tilt the result in a tight race			1
after a long campaign season , the undecideds have also earned scorn from some pundits and humorists , incredulous that anyone could remain uncertain after months of campaign advertising and media coverage			2
' low - information voter ' is one of the more polite names attached to this group			2
' this year at the debates we should skip that thing where the undecideds dial in their reaction to every little moment , ' remarked television host @entity64 , ' and instead hook up the dial to their foreheads to see if there is any measurable brain activity			2
' calling the satire unfair , @entity4 pollster @entity71 refers to the demographic tendencies found in the @entity16 / @entity15 poll as ' @entity25 moms			1
' fifty - four per cent of undecided voters are women			1
' overwhelmingly they are concerned with their family budgets , not the national budget , ' @entity71 said			2
' they are concerned about putting food on the table or gas in the tank			2
they have n't tuned into the campaign yet because they are struggling with their daily lives			2
they are living one paycheck away from going off the financial cliff			2
' among poll respondents who answered 10 on a 1 - to - 10 scale of their intention to vote , the undecided group was more likely to choose ' none , ' ' other , ' ' do n't know ' or ' refuse to answer ' on a broad range of questions about the presidential candidates and national political issues			1
on questions about the budget deficit , same - sex marriage , healthcare and immigration , this same subset was twice as likely as all likely voters to answer ' unsure ' when asked about their personal views			1
more of them believe the country is on the wrong track - 75 per cent , compared to 60 per cent - and they are much more likely to respond ' neither ' when asked whether @entity3 or @entity4 is the more eloquent , presidential , or likeable candidate			1
voting tendencies : ' overwhelmingly they are concerned with their family budgets , not the national budget , ' @entity118 pollster @entity71 said of the so - called ' @entity25 moms ' ' i just do n't feel like either of them are trustworthy , ' said @entity123 , 54 , an undecided voter and mother of seven from @entity125 , @entity126 , who voted for @entity128 in 2008			1
' i normally make up my mind and know who i 'm going to vote for			2
this time i need to do more research			2
' @entity3 , she said , has done a ' lousy job			0
' @entity4 ? ' i do n't think we should be taxing the medium class and low class and letting the rich get by without having to pay ( taxes ) , and that 's what i feel he wants			0
' @entity123 said she receives three or four automated phone calls a week from the @entity4 campaign			0
she listened the first time			0
now she just hangs up			0
@entity144 , 39 , another undecided voter from @entity145 , @entity146 , has been out of work three years and is ignoring her medical bills			1
she said neither candidate offers her any hope			0
' the economy keeps getting worse			0
my electricity 's been off for months			0
i do n't qualify for ( public assistance )			0
i 'm a white woman at 40 with no kids , ' said @entity144 , who voted for @entity128 in 2008 and has yet to be contacted by the campaigns this year			0
' i do n't see what either of these presidential wannabes can do for me			0
i might put @entity159 down for president			0
' @entity161 , 38 , a school bus driver from @entity162 , @entity32 , said he doubted either @entity3 or @entity4 could win his vote			0
he said he voted for @entity164 twice , @entity165 twice , and ' reluctantly ' for @entity128 in 2008			0
' with the two clowns that are running , i say ' undecided ' because i do n't have a third option , ' @entity161 said , lamenting the lack of a strong third - party candidate			1
' if one of them showed up at my door and paid all my bills , he could sway me			0
anything short of that , no. ' experts debate whether it is more cost - effective to court undecided voters or spend the time and money getting loyal supporters to the polls			1
' what 's most important in this race is which party is most able to motivate its base , ' said @entity188 , director of the @entity190 @entity189			0
still , ' it could be worthwhile for the campaigns to go after ( undecided voters ) because in several states it 's a very close race , and it could be decided by one or two percentage points			1
' when @entity15 looked at current undecided respondents who voted in the 2008 presidential race , the undecideds were slightly more concentrated in a region the @entity201 defines as the @entity202 , comprised of @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity32 and @entity33			1
nationally , 76 per cent were white compared to 72 per cent for all likely voters			1
the @entity4 campaign is making a special effort to woo the undecideds in swing states with phone calls , direct mail , email and one - on - one contact , @entity71 said			0
' they sound like voters who are up for grabs			1
these are encouraging demographics for us , ' he said , even though @entity4 's overall standing among women in the @entity16 / @entity15 poll is 33 per cent			1
the @entity3 campaign has an extensive ground organization that emphasizes neighbor - to - neighbor contact with undecided voters			1
that kind of personalized contact is the most effective way to mobilize the undecideds , said @entity232 , a political science professor at @entity233 , but it is also expensive			0
' that being said , ' @entity235 said , ' it 's never good to write off a sizeable constituency			0
as we saw in 2000 , it takes very few votes to switch the outcome of an election			0
' the poll has surveyed nearly 100,000 voters since january 1 .			2

undecided voters tend to be female , earn less than $ 25,000 , and do not have a college degree
@entity118 pollster likened that demographic to ' @entity25 moms '
6 per cent of voters in @entity7 considered ' undecided '
