by @entity0 published : 03:57 est , 5 november 2013 @entity2 : 20:19 est , 5 november 2013 tax worker @entity3 has been jailed for two and a half years for an elaborate scam to con her colleagues out of cash it started as a little fund to encourage her tax office colleagues to save a few pounds for @entity10			1
but as it took off , so did @entity3 ’s money - making ambitions			1
the 58 - year - old @entity14 manager made bogus promises of interest rate returns up to 14.5 per cent to encourage 40 staff to invest thousands of pounds in her @entity10 savings club			1
as a result , some paid in their retirement and wedding funds			0
by now , however , @entity23 had turned the club into a ponzi - style scam and was siphoning off cash to fund her own luxury lifestyle			1
in all , the civil servant stole more than £ 160,000 which she spent on extravagant holidays , expensive clothes and trips to watch @entity34 play in the rugby @entity35			1
even her husband , who worked in the same office , was unaware of the scam			0
yesterday , as her duped colleagues spoke of their ‘ betrayal ’ , @entity23 was beginning a two - and - a - half year jail term			1
@entity43 heard she had run the @entity10 savings club at the tax office in @entity47 , @entity48 , since the late 1970s			0
the scheme started as an honest way to encourage workers to save for the festive season			2
but from 2001 she urged them to invest larger sums with the promise of interest rates way above levels offered by banks and building societies on the high street			0
some of those who invested their money thought she had negotiated a special rate with the bank where the money was deposited			0
in fact , she was using the cash from new investors to spend on herself and pay out fake interest rates when it came to @entity10 withdrawals			2
to prevent a ‘ run ’ on the fund at @entity10 she offered bonus interest rates to keep the money in the account			0
one of @entity23 's colleagues at @entity78 in @entity47 said : ' i feel betrayed by @entity3 as i trusted her implicitly ' colleagues invested a total of more than £ 212,000 , but only £ 48,000 remained by the time the fraud was discovered			1
@entity83 , defending , said @entity23 had resorted to the scam after she became used to having more money thanks to a £ 35,000 bequest from her father - in - law			1
he said : ‘ what is abundantly clear is that she is extremely remorseful and ashamed of what happened			0
this scheme was not fraudulently run from the outset			2
‘ i think we can only speculate as to what happened but around the time the fraud started her father - in - law passed away and left her with an inheritance of £ 35,000 , and she probably got accustomed to a nice lifestyle			1
she was not aware the deficit had reached such a level – the matter had just got out of hand			0
’ the fraud was discovered when @entity14 investigators became suspicious of large sums of money being deposited in @entity23 ’s personal account			1
she was arrested at work in april and confessed during a police interview			0
at court she admitted 21 charges of fraud and one of theft			2
sentencing her , recorder @entity119 said : ‘ you ran the @entity10 club at @entity14 in @entity47 and encouraged people to put in more than just a few pounds			2
‘ you lied to them as to the rates of interest , rates which were not available anywhere else commercially			0
‘ you have expressed shame and made clear you know your behaviour has let down friends and others who trusted you with their savings			0
‘ you frittered the money away on a luxury lifestyle of holidays and nice clothes			2
’ @entity23 was sentenced at @entity43 to two - and - a - half years in prison for a string of fraud charges one colleague wrote in a victim impact statement : ‘ i feel betrayed by @entity3 as i trusted her implicitly			1
’ the court heard that @entity23 , who lived in a £ 200,000 house in @entity47 , planned to try to pay back the money when she started receiving her pension in a few years ’ time			1
proceeds of crime proceedings are ongoing to recover the victims ’ money , although investigators believe they may receive as little as a quarter of what was invested			0
@entity23 worked in a clerical role at @entity14			2
following her suspension from duty she was dismissed in august 2012 .			0

@entity3 , 58 , jailed for two - and - a - half years for string of fraud charges
she blew cash on clothes , holidays and going to watch rugby in @entity34
@entity23 ran scheme for a decade before investigators *uncovered* *deception*
