@entity0 might never have made it as a best - selling author and @entity3 would never have existed if it had n’t been for his wife , @entity5			1
the new @entity7 movie , @entity3 , which is the third silver - screened adaption of @entity0 ’s horror story , was released on friday , october 18 , starring @entity9 and @entity10			1
but 40 years ago , when @entity0 wrote the first three pages of @entity3 in 1973 , he immediately crumpled them up and threw them in the dustbin			1
@entity3 launched his career as a best - selling author discarded : the horror story , @entity3 , by @entity0 , almost did not make it past three pages he was disappointed in himself and felt he could n’t write from a woman ’s perspective , according to @entity24			1
the whole story disgusted him , too			0
@entity26 , the main character , was an annoying , ready - made victim and he felt the plot was already moving too slowly			2
‘ i could n’t see wasting two weeks , maybe even a month , creating a novella i did n’t like and would n’t be able to sell , ’ @entity0 wrote in his memoir , on writing			1
‘ so i threw it away … after all , who wanted to read a book about a poor girl with menstrual problems ? ’ the next day , his wife @entity5 found the three crinkled balls of paper and when @entity0 came home from work , she told him , ‘ you ’ve got something here			1
i really think you do '			0
first attempt : in the early 70s @entity0 felt @entity26 , the main character , was an annoying , ready - made victim when he first wrote the book over the next few weeks , @entity5 guided her husband through the world of women , giving tips on how to mold the characters and the famous shower scene			1
nine months later the final draft was finished			0
this was at a time when @entity0 was a poor man			2
he and @entity5 lived in a trailer and drove a rusty @entity53 held together by baling wire and duct tape			2
@entity5 worked second - shift at @entity57 while @entity0 taught @entity58 at @entity59 , a private high school in eastern @entity60			1
to scrape by , @entity0 worked summers at an industrial laundry and moonlighted as a janitor and gas pump attendant			2
barely scraping by : @entity0 worked summers at an industrial laundry and moonlighted as a janitor and gas pump attendant while he was writing @entity3 in the early 70s he modelled the character of @entity3 on two of the loneliest girls he remembered from high school			1
one was a timid epileptic with a voice that always gurgled with phlegm			0
her fundamentalist mother kept a life - size crucifix in the living room , and it was clear to @entity0 that the thought of it followed her down the halls			2
the second girl was a loner who wore the same outfit every day , which drew cruel taunts			0
by the time @entity0 wrote @entity3 , both of those girls were dead			1
the first died alone after a seizure			0
the second suffered from postpartum depression and , one day , aimed a rifle at her stomach and pulled the trigger			0
the final draft was turned down for 30 publishers , but one , the editor at @entity98 , @entity99 , offered him a $ 2,500 advance to publish the book			2
instant : @entity0 was catapulted to fame with the book @entity3 in 1973 and has written many books since @entity0 used the advance to buy a shiny @entity107 and moved his family out of the trailer and into a dumpy four - room apartment in @entity111 , @entity60			1
they suddenly had money for groceries and could even afford a telephone			0
he hoped that fat royalty checks would keep replenishing his bank account , but @entity3 only sold 13,000 copies as a hardback , which convinced him to grudgingly sign a new teaching contract for the 1974 school year			2
but soon after , one phone call changed everything			0
‘ are you sitting down ? ’ he asked			0
@entity0 was home alone , standing in the doorway between his kitchen and living room			2
‘ do i need to ? he said			0
‘ you might , ’ @entity99 said			0
‘ the paperback rights to @entity3 went to @entity131 for $ 400,000 ... @entity132 of it is yours			2
’ break - through : the paperback rights to @entity3 were given to @entity131 for $ 400,000 in 1973 at a time when @entity0 was a poor teacher with almost no money successful : @entity0 is now the 19th best - selling author of all time @entity3 sold over 1 million copies in its first year as a paperback despite a mixed critical response			1
the @entity144 was impressed , considering it was a first novel , while @entity146 called it ‘ terribly overdone			0
’ falling somewhere in the middle , the critic at the @entity148 said , ‘ it ’s pure trash , but i loved it			0
’ the book - buying public was more enthusiastic - @entity3 was a hit			1
the novel struck a sympathetic chord with teens and adults who knew what it was like to be an outsider			0
in 1975 , it was adapted into a profitable feature film , which sparked a sequel a decade later			0
the second version : actress @entity166 in the 1998 film adaption of @entity3 new version : the new film adaption of @entity3 , starring @entity10 , pictured , was released on october 18 the story about @entity3 struck a sympathetic chord with teens and adults who knew what it was like to be an outsider @entity0 modelled the character of @entity3 on two of the loneliest girls he remembered from high school			1
the new movie came out on friday now the 19th best - selling author of all time , @entity0 won the @entity182 to @entity184 letters in 2003 and was invited to speak at the @entity185			1
when he spoke , he did n’t talk about writing or success or money			0
he talked about the woman who rescued @entity3 from the trash and insisted he keep going - @entity5			1
‘ if my wife had suggested to me even with love and kindness and gentleness ... that the time had come to put my dreams away and support my family , i would have done that with no complaint , ’ said @entity0 at the awards ceremony			1
but the thought never crossed her mind			0
and if you open any edition of @entity3 , you ’ll read the same dedication : ‘ this is for @entity5 , who got me into it — and then bailed me out of it			1
