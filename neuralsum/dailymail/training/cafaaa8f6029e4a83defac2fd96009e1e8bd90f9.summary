the @entity1 's top spokesman warned on wednesday that long - term ' generational ' conflicts in the @entity3 will require the @entity4 to have a military presence there ' for many , many , many years			1
' and despite a $ 500 million commitment from @entity7 to ' train and equip ' moderate @entity10 rebels against the @entity12 terror army , the @entity1 is mired in planning , still as many as five months away from arming anyone			1
rear admiral @entity15 , the @entity1 's press secretary , made the statements during a press briefing about @entity4 's efforts to combat the @entity12 terror army in @entity19 and @entity10			1
' nobody 's under any illusion that we 're not going to have to maintain our focus , energy and resources in the @entity3 for many , many , many years to come , ' he said			0
@entity1 press secretary rear admiral @entity15 said wednesday that the @entity4 will be in the @entity3 ' for many , many , many years to come ' bombs , not boots : @entity29 airstrikes coordinated by the @entity4 have taken out strategic targets but failed to slow the advance of the @entity12 terror army ' we 've learned that this is a generational issue , ' @entity15 added , speaking of the sectarian war pitting @entity36 sects against each other			1
' none of these problems are going to be solved overnight , or quickly			1
' the admission that a long - term @entity4 military commitment is in the offing will likely embolden war hawks in @entity7 and anger political allies of president @entity46 , who is struggling to maintain his dovish image going into the november midterm elections			2
@entity46 won the @entity49 in 2009 , shortly after taking office			0
he has been insistent that @entity4 ' boots on the ground ' wo n't return to @entity19 , a war - torn country that had a significant @entity4 military presence until @entity46 withdrew all troops at the end of 2011			1
@entity15 reiterated wednesday that ' there will not be a return of @entity4 ground forces in a combat role in this fight , in @entity19 or @entity10			1
that has been made very clear			0
' the emphasis , he said , is on ' trying to get a moderate opposition trained and equipped			0
' most estimates put the fighting numbers of @entity12 , the self - declared @entity68 , at 31,000			0
at best , defense experts project that the @entity4 can train 5,000 opposition soldiers			2
and as @entity12 comes dangerously close to seizing the key @entity10 town of @entity72 near the @entity74 border , @entity15 conceded that that effort wo n't start until months of planning are completed			1
' there 's been no vetting started yet and no recruiting at this point , ' he said , referring to the @entity10 rebels whom the @entity4 hopes to arm			2
' we are in the very early stages right now of trying to develop the procedures and protocols within which we would do that			0
' @entity15 also said the @entity4 has no plan to launch a humanitarian relief effort in or near @entity72			2
' we should all be steeling ourselves for reality , ' he said , suggesting that @entity90 and other towns will fall to @entity12			0
@entity15 noted that the @entity4 is working closely with @entity92 , which has agreed to host a training facility			1
that relationship , as @entity15 described it , is still mired in bureaucracy and drawing - board efforts , and will consume ' three to five months before we can even get through that process			0
' fighting the clock slowly : as @entity4 spends ' three to five months ' planning a way to arm moderate @entity10 opposition forces , @entity12 scoops up cities like @entity90 in northern @entity10 , just a mile from @entity74 ' that 's before you even start doing any of the training			1
so this is going to be a long - term effort			0
' @entity4 leaders are ' sizing up the facility , getting a look at the infrastructure , and sort of figuring out the architecture within which the training would actually occur , ' @entity15 said			1
the @entity4 hopes – eventually , he said – to set up ' a viable , sustainable , verifiable program to properly recruit and vet these opposition members			0
' that effort , @entity119 press secretary @entity118 said a few hours later , ' is a key component for our strategy and will be critical to our success			0
' training @entity10 rebels , he told reporters during his daily briefing , ' will have a pretty dramatic impact on the conditions on the battlefield			2
' but at present , he admitted , ' our capabilities are still powerful , but they 're limited			0

@entity1 spokesman said effort to arm @entity10 rebel groups against @entity12 has n't even begun and is in the planning stages
@entity7 has agreed to spend $ 500 million to ' train and equip ' fighters
@entity1 and @entity92 are ' figuring out the architecture within which the training would actually occur '
rear adm. @entity15 conceded that ' generational ' @entity4 knows problems in @entity19 and @entity10 wo n't ' be solved overnight , or quickly '
