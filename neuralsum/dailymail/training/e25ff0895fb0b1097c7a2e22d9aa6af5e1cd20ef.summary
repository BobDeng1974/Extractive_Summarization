by @entity0 published : 09:09 est , 26 july 2012 updated : 10:00 est , 26 july 2012 the number of police officers in @entity4 and @entity5 has fallen to its lowest level in nine years , figures showed today			1
office numbers plummeted to 134,101 - more than 5,000 fewer than the previous year and fewer than at any point since 2003 , the @entity8 data showed			2
the number of police staff was also down , dropping 8.8 per cent to 67,474 and police community support officers ( @entity13 ) fell 9 per cent to 14,393			1
pcsos are not police officers ; they are civilian members of police staff			2
they are designed purely to tackle local anti-social behaviour and local issues			0
but the number of special constables rose 10.4per cent to 20,343 , the figures showed			0
special @entity23 are the @entity26 's part - time police force			1
they are made up of volunteer members of the public who when on duty wear a uniform and have full police powers			2
shadow home secretary @entity32 said : ' the @entity34 - led government has cut nearly 10,000 police officers from communities across the country			1
' and we know that substantially more than half are from 999 , neighbourhood and traffic response - the officers we rely on in an emergency			2
@entity32 says the @entity34 government is more interested in cutting police numbers than crime ' these figures show the cuts to the police are deeper and faster even than experts predicted			0
' @entity52 's promise to protect the front line has been ripped apart by these appalling figures			0
' in just two years the government has taken police numbers back by nearly a decade , weakened police powers , undermined morale and reduced crime prevention			0
' @entity60 has no strategy to cut crime , only to cut police			0
' in the 12 months to 31 march 2012 , the 43 police forces have recruited just 2,394 full - time equivalent officers			1
only the @entity67 police force has seen an increase in its number of officers over the 12 months to march , rising 4.7per cent from 1,885 to 1,974			1
this is because they are recruiting now as they underwent reductions in officer numbers between 2006 and 2009 , several years before @entity4 and @entity5 as a whole			0
the biggest drop in terms of percentage came in @entity80 , where police officer numbers fell 10per cent from 2,021 at the end of march last year to 1,819 12 months later			1
@entity83 , where officer numbers fell 8.2per cent from 919 to 844 , and @entity85 , where officer numbers fell 7.6per cent from 1,655 to 1,529 , also saw significant reductions			2
the largest numerical decrease was felt by the @entity89 , whose lost 323 officers ( 4 per cent )			0
policing and criminal justice minister @entity92 said : ' these reductions in officer numbers are in line with @entity95 ( @entity95 ) predictions as a result of necessary savings by forces who are playing their part in reducing the deficit			0
' however , @entity95 projections also showed that 94per cent of officers in the front line will remain , the proportion on the front line is increasing and service to the public is largely being maintained			0
fading fast : police graduates passing out at the @entity112 police academy , @entity113 , as it was revealed the number of police officers has fallen to its lowest level in nine years ' we inherited a situation where there were some 25,000 officers not on the front line , so there was plenty of scope for forces to make savings while improving performance , as forces are showing as they continue to drive down crime			2
' the @entity130 is the largest force , accounting for 24.0 per cent of all officers on 31 march 2012			1
the eight @entity130 forces - @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity130 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity89 and @entity139 - accounted for 47.9 per cent of all officers			1
the largest decreases in percentage terms were in @entity80 , down 10 per cent ( 202 officers ) and @entity83 , whose numbers fell 8.2 per cent ( 75 officers )			1
the largest numerical decrease was in the @entity89 , who dropped 4 per cent ( 323 officers )			0
there were decreases in total officer strength in all nine @entity152 and in @entity5 in the 12 months to march 2012			1
the largest decrease in percentage terms was in the @entity156 region , who fell 6.1 per cent ( 554 officers ) .			0

@entity80 officers down by 10 per cent and @entity83 down by 8.2 per cent
