by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the @entity4 licence fee should be scrapped and replaced with a voluntary subscription service , tv presenter @entity2 has claimed			1
the former host of @entity7 warned support for the @entity4 would ‘ fall off a cliff ’ if the mandatory charge for all owners of a television set is not axed			0
but the @entity13 hit back saying the change would mean fewer people paying much more each year to maintain a quality service			0
@entity17 host @entity2 said people who support the @entity4 could change their minds if the licence fee is not scrapped viewers must buy a tv licence £ 145.50 licence if they want to watch live broadcasts			1
but they can legally avoid paying by waiting until their favourite show is available on @entity27 instead			0
the rise of rival subscription services including @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 has also raised questions about the viability of a compulsory charge for the @entity4			0
wrangling over the future of the licence fee is expected to build in the run up to the renewal of the @entity4 royal charter in 2017			1
@entity2 argues that the flat fee for every home should be replaced with a pay - per - view or subscroiption charge , which he claims could raise more than the current £ 3.6billion			1
@entity2 told the @entity46 : ‘ i 'm one of the few people calling for the abolition of the licence fee who are doing this because they treasure the @entity4			1
‘ the experience of @entity30 is that people will voluntarily pay far more than they will under criminal sanction , and easily enough to promote and subsidise the encrypted radio - receiver technology that would need to be phased in			0
‘ people who support the @entity4 now could change their minds ; this would be pretty dangerous for the @entity4 , ’ he added			2
the @entity4 ¿ s @entity27 website received a record three billion requests for free online programmes last year , reigniting fears viewers will stop paying the tv licence fee however a @entity4 spokesman warned : ‘ while subscription might initially appeal to some , it would actually lead to more expensive fees paid for by fewer people			1
' the licence fee is effective and good value and continues to be the best way to fund the @entity4			2
' @entity2 is only the latest senior figure with links to the @entity4 calling for an overhaul of the licenece fee			0
question time host @entity75 last year called on the director - general @entity77 to hand out the licence fee to its commercial rivals to create ‘ more variety ’ in tv and radio output			0
it came after former head of tv news @entity85 admitted the @entity4 was too big and too left wing , and also suggested the licence fee should be shared with rivals and the number of tv channels reduced .			2

licence fee ' should be replaced with pay - per - view or subscription '
warns people who support the @entity4 now could change their minds
