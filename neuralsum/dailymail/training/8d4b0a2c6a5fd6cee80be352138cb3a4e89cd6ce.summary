by @entity0 published : 10:12 est , 23 august 2012 updated : 10:16 est , 23 august 2012 ' @entity2 ' binmen have refused to empty 20 wheelie bins on a single street because they were all just ' one inch too full ' and therefore too dangerous to deal with			1
the refuse collectors in @entity6 , @entity7 , ignored a third of black bins left outside on collection day saying health and safety rules stopped them collecting bins which did not have the lid fully closed			1
instead householders on @entity16 got a sticker on the bins - which carry non recyclable waste including plastic and polystyrene - and nowhere to put their waste for the next fortnight			1
anger : bins like this one in @entity6 were left by binmen who refused to empty them because they were an inch ' too full ' ' sorry we are unable to collect any extra waste or recycling that does n’t fit into your wheelie bin			1
the lids of the bin must be closed to collect safely , ' the sticker said			2
but one local resident , a young father , who wished to remain anonymous , said : ' the binmen left all the bins which had their lids raised - even if it was just half an inch			1
' we all got stickers warning us about overflowing bins too - yet they should collect the rubbish every week			0
' it ’s a nightmare			0
my bin was already overflowing but it is now overflowing a lot more because the binmen failed to empty it and now the outside of my home looks like a tip. stuck : each bin had a sticker explaining how full a bin must be , but the one on the sticker is much fuller than some that were left behind by the refuse collectors outrage : aggrieved residents on @entity63 in @entity6 , pictured , have hit out at the council after their wheelie bins were not collected ' with having a little lad , the bins get full up quite quickly and because they are only collected every two weeks , we just ca n’t keep on top of it			1
' i ’ve even asked the collectors if they can take an extra bin bag , as the bin will only fit two bags in			0
they just told me that they were n’t allowed to do it			0
' the bin collectors wo n’t even empty the bins if the lid is open a tiny bit - it ’s stupid			0
why should the rubbish be left in my garden if i have put my bins out like i ’m supposed to ? ' i think it ’s outrageous that we have to pay council tax for a service that we are not getting , and it makes me very angry			1
the bags are just stacking up , and it looks terrible			0
' the bins should be collected every week , and we should n’t be left with the rubbish that is supposed to have been collected			1
' another householder said : ' this must be worth a council tax refund			0
it ’s disgrace that bins should not be emptied because they are too full			2
these binmen are just being jobsworths			0
' bamboozled : locals residents say they are utterly confused by the number of bins they need to use at home officials at coalition run @entity107 spent £ 7.3m of taxpayers cash on a new system different coloured wheelie bins - whilst shedding 350 jobs under @entity113 cutbacks			2
but they bamboozled locals with a system which includes blue bins being earmarked for paper and card , brown bins are now to be used for glass and plastic and green bins for garden waste and food			2
they also brought in new black bins for non recyclable waste and ' caddies ' also for food to replaced the ' old ' single black bins which the 136,000 residents of the town used to have outside their homes			1
the letters under @entity135 of the @entity136 warned locals if they continued to flout the rules they would instantly face a £ 100 fine , and if they failed to pay up they could be taken to court and fined up to £ 1,000			0
today @entity107 said : ' non-collection of overfull bins is in line with @entity107 policy which states that wheeled containers containing waste that does not fit comfortably within the container and the lid is ajar will not be collected			1
' a notice will be left on the container explaining why the waste has n’t been collected			2
the householder will need to use the @entity153 / local recycling site , or wait until the next collection			0

council *workers* blamed health and safety rules for abandoning full bins on a @entity6 street
they stickered each one of the 20 they left , even though some had lids that were clearly only *centimetres* ajar
residents of @entity16 say they now have nowhere to put waste with a fortnight until the next collection
