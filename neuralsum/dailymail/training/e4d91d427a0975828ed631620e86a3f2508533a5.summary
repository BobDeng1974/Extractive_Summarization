‘ i do n’t know if we ’ll ever get to the bottom of it now ’			2
@entity41 , president of victims of @entity4 , which represent the @entity45 families who lost loved ones in the disaster , said : ‘ @entity9 was shameless , he was unrepentant and chose to go to his death claiming that he had nothing to do with the bombing , which was unbelieveable			1
