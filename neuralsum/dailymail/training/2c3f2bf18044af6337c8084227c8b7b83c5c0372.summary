by @entity0 a couple now weigh less than when they got married 20 years ago after shedding 10 stone between them			0
@entity5 , 42 , and his 41 - year - old wife @entity6 finally faced up to the reality of how big they had become when they could n't fit into their outfits at @entity11			1
but things have changed and now they are celebrating winning @entity14 ’s @entity13 just in time for their 20th wedding anniversary			1
@entity5 and @entity6 weigh less now ( right ) than when they got married 20 years ago ( right ) @entity6 's weight crept up to 15st 6.5lbs and a size 20 , while @entity5 tipped the scales at 19st 10lbs with a hefty 48in waist they started slimming after @entity5 was forced to go home and change into jogging bottoms at @entity11 because he was ' spilling out ' of his best trousers			1
the @entity27 couple met in 1989 when @entity6 was just 16 and @entity5 was 17 and married five years later with the bride in a size 18 dress , while the groom wore a 48 inch waist suit			1
their two children - @entity34 , now 18 , and @entity35 , now 15 , - came along and @entity6 ’s weight crept up to 15st 6.5lbs and a size 18/20 , while @entity5 tipped the scales at 19st 10lbs with a hefty 48in waist after over indulging on treats including ready meals and tea and biscuits			1
but eventually the couple replaced frozen lasagnes and pies with homemade goodies as well as pasta salad and fruit - and lost 10st 4lbs between them			2
the couple , pictured before they lost weight , feasted on a diet of ready meals and were spurred into action when @entity5 could n't fit into his best clothes @entity6 shed 4st 12lbs and now weighs in at 10st 8.5lbs and wears a svelte size 12 , while her hubby lost 5st 6lbs to weigh 14st 4lbs and fits into a 34ins waist			1
breakfast now includes poached eggs with beans on wholemeal toast or a big bowl of fresh raspberries with fat free yogurt instead of cereal with milk			0
old habits of eating ham sandwiches on buttered white bread with a side of crisps and chocolate for lunch have been replaced by homemade pasta salad with chicken or tuna , spring onions , peppers and sweetcorn			0
frozen pizzas for dinner have been swapped for spaghetti and meatballs and a large salad , while the pair enjoy a mid-morning snack of fruit and mid-afternoon high - fibre cereal bar instead of biscuits			0
the slimmers have even replaced a normal cup of tea with milk for fruit or green tea - but still enjoy a beer at the weekend			0
teacher @entity6 said : ' my family always described me as ‘ from good stock ’ or ‘ big boned ’ and @entity5 was just told he had puppy fat so neither of us worried too much about our size			2
@entity6 and @entity5 celebrate as they are named @entity14 couple of the year just in time for their 20th wedding anniversary ' i suppose when we got together we were happy and content , and like a lot of couples that saw us gain more weight			1
' i always say we were blissfully ignorant because we were young and content , we did n’t realise how big we were or the health implications of our weight			0
' we did n’t think about what we were eating and just concentrated on enjoying our children			0
' in 2006 @entity6 joined @entity14 and dropped 4st 7lbs , but when she stopped attending the weekly group because of work commitments , she struggled to keep up the healthy eating and piled the pounds back on			1
but when her clothes began getting tight in january 2013 , @entity6 decided to join her local group in @entity27 under the watchful eye of @entity124 , along with cab driver @entity5			2
the couple now snack on fruit and high fibre cereal bars instead of tea and biscuits he said : ' the turning point for me came on christmas day 2012			0
' we got dressed up for dinner , put our gladrags on as you do , but i felt so uncomfortable in my smart trousers and shirt because they were tight and i felt like i was spilling out over my trousers			0
' i ended up going home to put my joggers on and that ’s when i knew i needed to do something			0
' the determined couple followed @entity14 ’s @entity147 healthy eating plan and started cooking from scratch - roping the kids into their changing their diets too			1
@entity5 said : ' we share the cooking and it ’s so much more satisfying than ripping off some plastic and popping something in the microwave - my specialty is tomato and basil soup			2
' the newly slim pair say they are happier and healthier than ever the couple have even signed up for the @entity160 in september , with @entity5 running for @entity161 and @entity6 fundraising for @entity27 ’s @entity162			2
@entity6 added : ' we ’ve got our wedding anniversary and the @entity160 this year , and now winning @entity13 makes it even more special			1
