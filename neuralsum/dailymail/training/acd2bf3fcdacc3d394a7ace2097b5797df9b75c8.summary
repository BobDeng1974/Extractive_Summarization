after years of study at elite universities , you could presume that our brightest students would emerge knowing how to apply for a job			2
but top employers are struggling to fill graduate vacancies due to a glut of sloppy applications			1
a leading recruiter said students about to leave university take a ‘ scattergun ’ approach to sending out cvs rather than properly researching each position they apply for			2
' @entity17 ' : employers attacked graduates for not paying attention in their applications some simply cut and paste paragraphs between cover letters , and even mistakenly refer to rival companies			1
they do not always understand the basic requirements of the job they are applying for or even what the role involves			1
this is despite the fact that many applications are from final year students at leading universities who are expected to achieve at least a 2:1 degree			2
@entity38 carried out by the @entity39 – which represents leading firms including @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity44 @entity43 – has cast doubt on the calibre of today ’s university leavers			1
the @entity39 took a snapshot poll of 68 members ahead of its larger annual summer survey			0
it found a predicted 10 per cent increase in the number of graduate jobs available on previous year			1
nine out of ten employers said they still had vacancies for this year ’s recruitment round			1
when asked to explain why the positions remained unfulfilled , more than half said they had increased the number of graduate jobs they had available			0
better standard : employers insisted students needed to research their applications better but 67 per cent said the applications they had received so far had been ‘ of insufficient quality ’			1
one employer said : ‘ it is important that graduates take their applications seriously and not just assume they will get an interview because of their grades and the university they attended			1
‘ they need to make real efforts in researching before answering the application questions			0
we do sometimes see that an answer might have been copied and pasted from another application , especially when asked the question , “ why have you applied for [ this company ] ? ” we sometimes see answers that say “ i ’m applying to [ rival company ] ”			1
’ another employer said ‘ better written applications ’ were needed			0
the study found the highest percentage of vacancies were in @entity91 ( 26 per cent ) ; electrical / electronic engineering ( 23 per cent ) and general management ( 18 per cent )			2
@entity94 , chief executive of the @entity39 , said graduates ‘ are not taking enough time over their applications ’			2
he advised : ‘ there are graduate vacancies out there and making fewer , well targeted applications rather than taking a scattergun approach to finding a job will pay dividends			0
’ young people struggle to learn foreign languages because they do n’t have a proper grasp of @entity110 , a former @entity106 don says			0
too many are ignorant of their own language due to ‘ deplorable deficiencies ’ in the education system which leaves them unable to tell an adjective from an adverb			0
professor @entity118 , now professor of history at the @entity120 in @entity121 , @entity122 , said students ’ widespread ignorance of basic @entity110 is hampering the learning of other languages such as @entity127			0
the 63 - year - old @entity43 - born historian told the @entity130 magazine : ‘ as university teachers in the @entity43 know , most young @entity43 are unequipped to wield their own language with concision , elegance , exactitude or power			0
‘ if you can not speak or write your own language well , you are never going to be able to manage to master another			0

@entity38 found applicants pasting *wholesale* from previous attempts
sometimes the graduates mixed up which company they were applying to
