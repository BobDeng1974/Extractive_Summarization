@entity0 has sent two fighter jets to investigate @entity3 and @entity5 military planes ’ entry into a disputed area of the @entity7			1
tensions in the volatile region have mounted since the @entity10 stated that it ‘ escorted ’ foreign warplanes out of its newly - declared air defence identification zone ( @entity13 )			1
the zone covers islands which are the subject of a bitter territorial dispute with @entity5 – sparking fears that it could lead to an unplanned military incident			2
two @entity5 f - 15 fighter jets : @entity0 scrambled jets today in response to @entity3 spy planes and @entity5 aircraft - including @entity26 fighters - entering its new air defence zone over the @entity7 last week @entity29 declared that all aircraft crossing through airspace must file flight plans and identify themselves or face unspecified ‘ defensive emergency measures ’			1
but the @entity3 , @entity5 and @entity34 have all defied the ruling over the past few days			2
in an intensification of the spat , @entity0 yesterday launched fighter jets into the area at the same time as foreign military flights			0
@entity0 @entity10 spokesman colonel @entity41 said warplanes had been scrambled to monitor two @entity3 surveillance aircraft and ten @entity5 planes , including an f - 15 fighter jet , crossing through the @entity13			1
he was reported by state media as saying that the jets had tracked and identified the planes			0
ministers in @entity50 declined to give details of the flights but said the @entity5 @entity10 was on routine operations and had encountered no ‘ abnormal ’ incidents			0
@entity0 announced the creation of the zone last saturday			2
overlapping claims : this map shows the respective air defence and economic zones claimed by @entity0 and @entity5 and with the islands in the @entity7 that the two countries have been disputing highlighted it covers a vast area of the @entity7 , including a region where gas has been discovered			1
the row centres on airspace over three uninhabited outcrops called the @entity70 by @entity5 and @entity70 by @entity0			2
@entity71 also has a claim to the islands – bought by @entity5 from private sellers in 2012 , much to the anger of @entity0 – and @entity34 maintains an interest in a submerged rock in the zone known as @entity79			1
the @entity3 called the establishment of the @entity13 a ‘ destabilising attempt to alter the status quo in the region ’			0
@entity84 , the @entity85 foreign policy envoy , expressed concern about the diplomatic flare - up			0
she said : ‘ this development heightens the risk of escalation and contributes to raising tensions in the region			0
the @entity85 calls on all sides to exercise caution and restraint			0
’ worth fighting for ? an october 13 file photo shows a @entity97 patrol plane flying past one of the unoccupied disputed islets in the @entity7 claimed by both @entity0 and @entity5 but her intervention was mocked by @entity0 ’s @entity103 spokesman @entity102			1
‘ madam @entity104 should know that some @entity106 countries also have air defence identification zones , ’ said @entity102			1
‘ i do n’t know if this leads to tensions in the @entity106 regional situation			0
@entity106 countries can have air defence identification zones			1
why ca n’t @entity0 ? ’ international analysts claim @entity29 is engaged in a long - term strategy to boost its claims to the disputed islands , rather than displaying a military show of force			2
june @entity119 , a security specialist at the @entity120 , said the policy was aimed at placating the domestic audience			0
she said : ‘ they will be seen to “ escort ” the intruding planes , but they are not going to shoot them			0

two fighters monitored two @entity3 planes and 10 @entity5 aircraft , @entity0 says
the country announced *unilateral* air - defence identification zone last week
it overlaps with a *similar* zone already claimed by @entity5
