that 's because @entity14 's family contacted police after hearing media reports to say @entity14 had told them and made @entity132 posts that she was pregnant			2
@entity14 's build apparently made her claims at least somewhat credible , as a criminal complaint lists her at 5 - foot - 4 and 230 pounds , but @entity123 said her family doubted the claims enough to call police as soon as they heard of the kidnapping			2

after the other employee left , however , @entity14 followed a discharge nurse into @entity58 's room and appeared to the baby 's family to be a nurse 's aide			2

that 's when , police said , ' @entity14 approached @entity58 and took the baby from @entity58 and told her that one more physical test needed to be conducted on the baby and that she would return @entity22 right away			1
' instead , @entity14 went to a secluded area of the hospital and put the baby in a red zippered cloth handbag and left the hospital			2
