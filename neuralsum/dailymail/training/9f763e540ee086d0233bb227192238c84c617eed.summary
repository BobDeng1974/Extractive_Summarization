@entity1 captain @entity0 will technically play his final match for his home - town club in saturday 's @entity4 but he is far from ready to hang up his boots			1
the 34 - year - old full - back 's contract is up at the end of the season and , remarkably , he has yet to open talks over a new deal			2
the decision of head coach @entity13 to cut short his stay at @entity15 and return to @entity17 after saturday 's game adds to the uncertainty but @entity0 remains laid back , confident that he will be starting his 18th season with @entity21 in february			1
@entity1 coach @entity13 ( left ) is returning to @entity17 after saturday 's @entity4 ' i 'm kind of in a different situation to most players , ' @entity0 said			1
' you 'd expect it to be done and dusted but i 've got a relaxed relationship with the chairman			0
' i 've spoken to him about it and said we 'll just get this season done and sit down and talk			0
i 've made it clear that i 'd like to go around for another year and i think the chairman is thinking along the same lines			0
' because i 've got that relaxed relationship and i trust him and ( chief executive ) @entity38 ( @entity39 ) and the people within the club , i 'm afforded that luxury of being relaxed about it			0
' @entity1 fullback @entity0 is confident that he will be back playing with the club next season @entity13 's departure has raised the tantalising prospect of @entity50 pairing up with his old @entity1 team - mate @entity51 to form a ' dream coaching team '			1
@entity53 , who has been @entity13 's right - hand man for the last two years after ' holding the fort ' with @entity39 for most of the 2012 season , looks sure to remain involved , either as the club 's new head coach or as assistant to the new man , but @entity0 insists the move into coaching right now would be too soon for him			1
' you never know , maybe in the future some time , ' said @entity0 , who was brought onto the @entity66 backroom staff for the 2013 @entity67			2
@entity0 ( left ) holds the @entity69 trophy with @entity71 captain @entity70 ' i 've made no secret of the fact i 'd like to get into coaching , it 's something that really appeals to me			2
' but what happens with the coaching is out of my hands			0
i trust in the people at the club to make the right appointments			0
