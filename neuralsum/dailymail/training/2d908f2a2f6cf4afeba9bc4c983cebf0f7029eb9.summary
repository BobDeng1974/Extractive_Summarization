she has @entity58 - a genetic condition that mrs @entity0 's brother @entity14 also suffers from @entity0 will eventually learn to read braille and have white stick training to help her cope when she loses her sight , but for now her parents are focusing on helping her make memories now retinitis pigmentosa is a rare hereditary condition affecting 10,000 people in @entity70 - it gradually destroys the retina , the light - sensitive layer at the back of the eye			1
the condition causes permanent changes to vision but how quickly this happens and how it changes differs between people			0
in most of the more common forms of retinitis pigmentosa , the first symptoms occur between childhood and the age of 30			0
the first symptom you is people with the condition find it difficult to see in poor light , such as outdoors at dusk , or in a dimly lit room			0
this is often referred to as ' night blindness '			0
while most people find it takes their eyes about 20 minutes to adapt to dim light , a person with the condition will find it will either take much longer or it wo n't happen at all			0
a second symptom is the loss of some o peripheral vision or peripheral visual field			0
this means that when the person is looking straight ahead they become less able to see things either to the side , above or below			0
currently , there is no known cure or treatment for rp or associated retinal disorders			0

mrs @entity0 whose 27 - year old husband is a civil servant added : ' although my brother has the condition and several uncles have had it , i never thought @entity0 could have inherited it because we were always told that only boys could get it			1

we do n’t know exactly when @entity0 will go blind but it feels as though her sight deteriorates every time we go to the opticians			1
