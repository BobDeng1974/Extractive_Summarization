by @entity0 published : 19:14 est , 11 february 2013 updated : 05:27 est , 12 february 2013 @entity2 boss @entity1 launched an impassioned plea to keep his bonus yesterday as his bumper pay packet was described as ‘ modest ’			1
mr @entity1 admitted he was the ‘ captain on the bridge ’ while his traders rigged interest rates but said he still merited being handed a shares pay - out worth £ 780,000			1
he received the backing of @entity2 chairman sir @entity12 , who described mr @entity1 ’s basic pay package of more than £ 1.6million as ‘ modest ’ by banking standards			1
@entity2 chief executive @entity1 speaks to the @entity15 yesterday sir @entity12 ’s comment was last night described by campaigners as ‘ an insult to ordinary taxpayers ’ , who bailed @entity2 out to the tune of £ 45.5billion during the financial crisis			1
mr @entity1 , sir @entity12 and a string of @entity2 bosses yesterday gave evidence to the @entity27 of @entity28 and peers over the libor rate - rigging scandal – at its worst between 2006 and 2010 – which culminated in a £ 390million fine from @entity34 and @entity35 regulators last week			1
the commission warned @entity2 against ‘ creative accounting ’ over plans to recoup £ 300million in bonuses from employees to pay @entity34 regulators			0
mr @entity1 said he accepted ultimate responsibility as the ‘ captain on the bridge ’ since he took the helm of @entity2 in november 2008 , shortly after it was rescued			2
but he faced awkward questions over why only one senior manager , investment bank chief @entity47 , has resigned over the wrongdoing			0
he was also asked why he was clinging on to the £ 780,000 shares bonus awarded in 2010 , which will be transferred to him next month			1
mr @entity1 , who already receives a basic £ 1.2million salary and a £ 420,000 cash payment instead of a pension , can cash the shares in a year later			1

write caption here @entity27 chairman @entity58 , who suggested mr @entity47 had been made into a ‘ human shield ’ for the debacle , said : ‘ mr @entity47 has paid with his job			0
do you not think you should pay with your bonus ? ’ mr @entity1 said his bonus ‘ should be assessed on all the things i do ’ , adding : ‘ if you look at the @entity2 we took on four years ago that we have done huge things to rescue a situation for the company and for society and stakeholders			1
‘ this includes hundreds of billions of pounds of risk that the country was exposed to and is n’t any more			0
’ the bank boss claimed he was responsible for defusing ‘ the biggest balance sheet time bomb in corporate history ’			0
over the last four years , @entity2 has removed £ 700billion of toxic assets from its balance sheet			0
mr @entity1 was supported by chairman sir @entity12 , who argued that he is paid ‘ well below the market rate for bankers ’			2
sir @entity12 also pointed out that mr @entity1 , who is eligible for a maximum annual package of £ 7.1million , has given up his bonus three times in four years			1
asked why only mr @entity47 has fallen on his sword , sir @entity12 said : ‘ we decided a single point of accountability was necessary – not a mass series of assassinations ’			0
but the comments about mr @entity1 ’s pay infuriated critics			2
@entity96 , of the @entity98 think - tank , said : ‘ the idea that mr @entity1 is paid modestly is insulting to taxpayers and people on average salaries			2
‘ there are big question marks over whether he deserves his bonus when the rigging of interest rates continued for two years under his watch			0
