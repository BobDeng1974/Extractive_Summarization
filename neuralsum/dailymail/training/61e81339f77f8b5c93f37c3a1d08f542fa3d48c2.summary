@entity9 and @entity10 from @entity11 , were just weeks away from picking up little @entity12 from a @entity14 orphanage , when the @entity5 president @entity15 passed a ban on @entity2 adopting @entity5 children			1
the move was widely seen as retaliation for a @entity2 law which targeted @entity5 suspected of violating human rights			1
@entity22 : @entity10 gives adopted son @entity12 a great big kiss after successfully getting him back to the @entity2 despite a ban on @entity2 adopting @entity5 children despite feeling that the odds were stacked against them , the @entity10 travelled to @entity5 mid-january so they could at least try to bring @entity12 back at the time the @entity29 were devastated , with @entity9 breaking down in tears on television as he made a heartfelt plea to @entity15 to reconsider the policy he told @entity34 at the time : ' i can not put into words how my wife and i feel right now			1
@entity5 president @entity15 passed a ban on @entity2 adopting @entity5 children ' and we ask @entity15 , please , consider alternate means , but do n't let these children suffer			1
that 's all we ask			0
' but despite feeling that the odds were stacked against them , the @entity10 travelled to @entity5 mid-january so they could at least try to bring @entity12 back			1
in an interview with @entity34 mrs @entity10 recalled : ' we did not know			0
we just prayed and kept the faith and just kept believing that , you know , all of our efforts would pay off			0
' the couple thought all hope was lost after a clerk at a @entity5 government office refused to process as passport for @entity12			1
' she looked at it and she said in @entity5 , " @entity2 ? i thought there was a ban on @entity2			1
how could we give them this passport ? " ' @entity10 recalled			0
' we held our breath and i gasped for air and i said , oh no. please , do n't let us go through all this and we 're going to have problems , " @entity9 added			0
the couple were save thanks to a loophole which stated that because the judge had already signed off on their adoption before the law was passed			2
they returned the next day and were issued a passport for @entity12			2
five days later , they left @entity5 and brought @entity12 home			2
new home : @entity12 plays with some of his toys back at the @entity29 ' house in @entity11 new wheels : @entity12 's new father pushes him around on a @entity86 - style tricycle ' @entity9 and i looked at each other and we said , it 's over , it 's over			1
and i ca n't even tell you the relief			0
and how elated we are , ' said @entity10			0
' i completely understand when a mother says that she takes one look at her newborn child and is instantly in love with that child			0
i 'm in love with him			0
i 'm in love with him , and i do believe he 's in love with us , too			0
' the @entity10 were one of an estrimated 1,0000 @entity2 families caught in teh middle of the adoption process when the ban was passed			2
the @entity108 estimates just 50 of those will be allowed to return to the @entity2 with their children .			2

@entity11 couple were weeks away from picking up little @entity12
but @entity5 president @entity15 passed ban on @entity2 adopting
seen as retaliation for @entity5 being targetted for human rights *abuses*
but they flew out to @entity14 anyway in a last - ditch effort to bring him back
