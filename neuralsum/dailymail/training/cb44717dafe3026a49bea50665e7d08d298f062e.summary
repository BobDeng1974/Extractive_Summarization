by @entity0 published : 18:27 est , 6 april 2013 updated : 18:27 est , 6 april 2013 the @entity1 was hit by a new split last night following claims that @entity4 is blocking plans by business secretary @entity6 to save the ailing @entity8 pub. @entity9 mr @entity6 wants to launch a new watchdog to combat allegations that big pub companies are driving tied landlords to the wall by charging too much for beer and rent			1
the new rules would give landlords the right to free themselves from brewers			2
community : the @entity1 is at loggerheads over how to save the ailing @entity8 pub but the chancellor has stepped in amid @entity24 claims that the changes could strangle the industry with red tape and put up the price of a pint			1
mr @entity4 has vetoed plans by mr cable to launch a public consultation this week , in the run - up to the introduction of new laws later this year			1
mr @entity6 says the best way to save pubs is to set up a statutory code governing the relationship between pub companies and publicans , backed up by an independent adjudicator			1
pubs are currently closing at the rate of 20 a month , and nearly 29,000 of the 55,000 pubs in @entity8 are tied			1
conservative mp @entity46 , who backs the new curbs , said last night : ‘ the large pub owners have , quite literally , been drinking in the last - chance saloon for too long			0
these new controls are vital because some landlords have been brought to tears and the brink of bankruptcy by unfair terms			2
we treat post offices as a vital part of the community and it is time pubs were regarded in the same way			0
’ the rift between mr @entity4 and mr @entity6 has fuelled fresh claims that the chancellor has ‘ sold out ’ to big corporations and brewers at the expense of local communities			1
in the past the breweries were big donors to the @entity72 , and close links remain in some areas			0
at war : @entity6 has proposed plans to create a watchdog to help @entity8 landlords but they have been vetoed by chancellor @entity4 who believes it will result in too much red tape the two biggest pub owners , so called pubcos , are @entity83 and punch taverns			1
other pubs are owned by local breweries			1
one insider said : ‘ the pubcos have organised a highly expensive and sophisticated lobbying organisation and it seems as though it has had a big effect on @entity72 cabinet ministers			0
‘ the pubcos bought pubs when property prices were high and now prices have slumped they are trying to exploit landlords			2
all landlords want is the right to a fair rent and to serve the beer their customers want at fair prices			0
’ mr @entity6 said earlier this year : ‘ there is some real hardship in the pubs sector , with many pubs going to the wall as publicans struggle to survive on tiny margins			1
some of this is due to pubcos exploiting and squeezing their tenants by unfair practices and a focus on short - term profits			0
‘ i hope my new measures mean publicans are given a fairer chance at running their pubs			0
’ he added that he had given the pubcos one last chance to change their behaviour last year , but it was clear the self - regulatory approach was not enough			0
mr @entity6 ’s code includes rents and the prices publicans pay for beer			2
the adjudicator would have the power to investigate and deal with disputes between pub companies and publicans , and impose fines			0
pubcos own thousands of pubs and bars and decide where tied landlords can buy beer from and at what price			2
the code would prevent tied licensees being forced to pay up to 50 per cent more for beer than other licensees .			0
