last week , @entity67 named five people to head a commission of inquiry into the bank , the @entity48 , or @entity30 , to get to the root of the problems that have plagued it for decades and mired the @entity3 in scandal over the years			1
at the start of this week , the top two managers at the @entity30 resigned			0
their boss , bank president @entity78 , had just weeks earlier praised @entity79 and @entity80 as ' truly happy ' and helpful collaborators as the bank worked to comply with anti-money - laundering norms			0

' he said the bank was reviewing each of the @entity30 's 19,000 accounts ' and we will systematically identify and eradicate wrongdoing of clients in our institute			2

police seized 23 million euros , though it was later ordered released			0
@entity8 news reports said prosecutors would exonerate @entity123 , given he had nothing to do with the day - to - day functioning of the bank , but would likely seek indictments against @entity79 and @entity80 , though the exact nature of the accusations against them remains unclear			0

despite the news of the resignations the @entity3 won coveted membership in the @entity145 this week , joining a club that aims to share financial information in the global fight against money laundering and terror financing			1
for @entity139 , dubbed the ' @entity157 of the financial world ' by some media , joining @entity145 means that the @entity3 now is part of a trusted ' family ' and has more help in combating financial crimes - even if it ca n't root them out entirely			2
' with this membership , we are a credible player in the international and global fight against money laundering and terror finance , ' @entity139 said in a telephone interview thursday from @entity142			0
' the @entity145 , which was created in 1995 , aims to smooth the exchange of information and improve cooperation among its members			0
those members are the financial intelligence units of countries ' central banks - the departments that collect and investigate reports of suspicious financial transactions			0

' no country in the world is 100 percent perfect , ' he said			0
' what 's important is if something is happening , you have the competent authority and you have the tools and measures to take relevant action			0
' the next step for @entity139 is to ink a bilateral agreement with @entity8 to share financial information - a critical step given that the @entity8 have been the harshest critics of the @entity3 's murky financial dealings , convinced that people have used the @entity30 to shield money from @entity8 tax authorities			1
as it is , @entity8 prosecutors have various investigations under way targeting the @entity3 bank and people who may have used it for less than holy ends			2
