top lawyers have written guidelines for @entity4 solicitors on drafting ' sharia - compliant ' wills which can deny women an equal share of their inheritance and entirely exclude non-believers , it was revealed today			1
@entity10 , which represents solicitors in @entity12 and @entity13 , has written a guide on @entity16 succession rules that will be used in @entity4 courts			1
it will mean that children born outside of marriage and adopted children could also be denied their fair share			1
the guide states : ' no distinction is made between children of different marriages , but illegitimate and adopted children are not @entity16 heirs			1
new guidance for lawyers on drawing up wills based on @entity16 principles have been released by @entity4 legal experts			1
pictured , the @entity32 of @entity4 preside over marital cases at their east @entity35 headquarters ' the male heirs in most cases receive double the amount inherited by a female heir of the same class			2
non-muslims may not inherit at all , and only @entity43 marriages are recognised			2
' similarly , a divorced spouse is no longer a @entity16 heir , as the entitlement depends on a valid @entity43 marriage existing at the date of death			2
' @entity10 claims the guide is simply to promote ' good practice ' and ' support members so they can help clients from all backgrounds ' - but the move has been criticised by equality campaigners			1
@entity56 , executive director of the @entity57 , an organisation that campaigns for strict separation of the state from religious institutions and equality of religion before the law , says the move is a backwards step that undermines @entity4 justice			1
equality campaigner @entity67 said the @entity10 document ' violates everything we stand for ' he said : ' the @entity4 has the most comprehensive equality laws in the world , yet the @entity10 seems determined to undermine this by giving approval to a system that relegates women , non-muslim and children born out of wedlock to second class citizenship			1
' instead of running scared at any mention of sharia , politicians of all parties should face these issues square on and insist on the primacy of democratically - determined human rights - compliant law			1
' laws determined by @entity91 should prevail over centuries - old theocratic laws			2
we should have @entity94 , not allowing any law to operate which disadvantages any sections of the community			0
' @entity98 , president of the @entity10 , said in a statement : ' this practice note provides guidance to solicitors dealing with clients where @entity16 succession rules may be relevant			1
' this is the first time such advice has been published and we hope it will assist solicitors with @entity16 probate matters			0
' there is a wide variety of spiritual , religious and cultural beliefs within our population , and the @entity10 wants to support its members so they can help clients from all backgrounds			1
' we hope this guidance will help solicitors assist their clients and go some way to forming an idea of good practice when it comes to applying @entity16 succession rules within the legal profession			0
' but @entity67 , who campaigns against religious discrimination against women , said the guidance was a worrying development			2
she told the @entity132 : ' this violates everything we stand for			0
it would make the @entity135 turn in their graves			0
' in the past she has spoken out about the growth of ' @entity140 courts ' resolving disputes			0
she said : ' no longer do we have a single legal code in our society			0
' instead , alongside our own law , there is now effectively a parallel quasi-legal system operating within some @entity43 communities			0
' @entity16 law , imported from theocracies like @entity151 and @entity152 , first began to be used here in a strictly limited form , dealing mainly with narrow issues like @entity140 financial contracts			0
' but as the @entity43 population has grown and the pervasive creed of multiculturalism has become ever more powerful , so @entity16 law has rapidly grown in influence within some communities			0
' there are now estimated to be no fewer than 85 @entity16 courts across the country â€” from @entity35 and @entity166 to @entity167 and @entity168			0
they operate mainly from mosques , settling financial and family disputes according to religious principles			0

the guidelines on wills could mean women are denied an equal inheritance
adopted children could also face *losing* out under @entity10 document
the move has been criticised as a backwards step by equality campaigners
