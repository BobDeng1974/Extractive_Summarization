' i thought it was a really harsh decision			0
what i would say is that referees have to be more consistent , ' he said of the penalty award			0
' there are a thousand incidents like that and to isolate one looks unfair			0
i have seen it again briefly and it looked like they were both at it			0
' the same thing happened in the @entity6 penalty area and if you give them all , the game will end up seven - all			1
' @entity3 has already collected one red card and five yellows since signing from @entity95 club @entity94 in august and his late intervention did spoil @entity66 's big night as the proper boss after four spells as caretaker			0
twice , 19 - year - old @entity16 had given @entity0 the lead with terrific long - range strikes , a fitting goalscorer as he was one of the youngsters developed by @entity66 at the club 's academy			1
but it is a sign of @entity107 's @entity0 at the moment that every forward step is met quickly with a backward one			2
no sooner had @entity16 put @entity0 ahead early in the second half than goalkeeper @entity112 allowed @entity11 's shot to go through his legs at the near post			1
@entity6 's @entity7 is hauled down by @entity116 ( right ) to give @entity6 a late penalty then when @entity16 repeated his magic to score from 25 yards , another of @entity121 's @entity95 imports showed indiscipline at a time when officials are looking out for shirt - pulling following the @entity125 off in the @entity127 campaign			1
@entity107 , who has sacked three managers since buying @entity0 in april , was at @entity5 to see his latest appointment take charge			2
@entity6 manager @entity131 said : ' 2 - 1 for us was more justified than 2 - 1 to them			1
but you ca n't do anything when a player ( @entity16 ) has a shot like that from 25 yards , you can only applaud			2
@entity11 sends @entity112 the wrong way from the penalty spot ' i did n't see the penalty at the end because i was looking at one of my player @entity145 who had an injury			2
but we deserved a result			0

@entity66 will have to pick his side up again			0
' we are a wounded animal			0
i am dragging them back into the world , ' he said			0
' i want better than ok			0
