by @entity1 reporter scientists appear to have traced the irresistible pull of the refrigerator at 2am to the ' night munchies ' gene scientists appear to have traced the irresistible pull of the refrigerator at 2am to the ' night munchies " gene			1
when the @entity15 gene is faulty , the natural mechanism that synchronises sleeping and eating goes awry , they believe			2
this can lead to ' night eating syndrome ' , the inability to avoid feeling hungry at night which in some people can disrupt sleep and lead to over-eating and weight gain			0
the discovery was made by conducting tests on mice with two human genes , @entity15 and its partner @entity28 , which has previously been linked to sleep disturbances			1
when @entity28 was defective in the mice , as expected they dozed off earlier than usual			1
but de-activating @entity15 affected eating behaviour , leading to mice wanting to eat when they should be sleeping			1
' for a long time , people discounted night eating syndrome as not real , ' said lead scientist dr @entity39 , from the @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity42			0
' these results in mice suggest that it could actually be a genetic basis for the syndrome			0
' we really never expected that we would be able to decouple the sleep - wake cycle and the eating cycle , especially with a simple mutation			0
it opens up a whole lot of future questions about how these cycles are regulated			0
' when the researchers restricted access to food , offering it to the mice only at normal meal times , they found that even animals with the faulty @entity15 gene maintained a normal weight			2
over a 10 - week period their weight was no different to that of animals with functioning @entity15 genes			2
when the @entity15 gene is faulty , the natural mechanism that synchronises sleeping and eating goes awry , they believe this showed that the weight gain caused by faulty @entity15 was entirely due to meal mistiming and not other metabolic factors			0
the scientists believe that normally , @entity15 and @entity28 are kept synchronised and turned on and off at the same time , keeping sleep and eating cycles aligned			1
but a mutation in @entity15 can break this link , leading to an urge to eat at night			1
the research is reported in the journal @entity83 .			0
