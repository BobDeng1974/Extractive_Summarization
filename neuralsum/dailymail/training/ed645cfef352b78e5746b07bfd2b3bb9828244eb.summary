by @entity0 the discovery of @entity3 ’s remains in a car park may have been out of this world , but a new exhibition has been accused of making him look as if he comes from another planet			0
experts are outraged that organisers at the @entity11 in @entity12 have painted a copy of the @entity3 ’s armour white , saying it makes him look like a @entity17 stormtrooper			1
members of the team who helped trace the skeleton have also branded an image of @entity3 lying in his grave as ‘ grotesque ’ , saying it shows a lack of respect for the dead			1
ms @entity38 , author of ‘ @entity3 : the @entity41 ’ , wrote : ‘ other grotesque exhibits include the white - painted depiction of the king ’s armour resembling a stormtrooper from @entity17 , despite representatives of the council and university having attended the presentation by dr @entity51 in march 2013 where he described his armour and illustrated its actual probable appearance			1
‘ as an example of the organisers ’ taste in these matters , it was only by strenuous insistence that we removed the planned visual which was to greet visitors : the central throne was to be drenched in a sickening pool of blood which dropped down to form words written in blood on the floor below			1
’ academics say that staff at the new @entity11 were given a presentation on how the armour would probably have looked , but chose to ignore that advice @entity38 , who is part of the team who helped track down the remains , says that alongside the armour there were plans for a blood - soaked throne in the exhibit , but it was removed after her team insisted she said about the imagery of the dead body : ‘ we know this will be devastating not only to those who had trusted that the discovery of @entity3 ’s remains would be conducted with dignity , but indeed to all civilised visitors who believe in the concept of respect for the dead			1
’ ms @entity38 said the exhibition sidelined the efforts of the team which found the remains ‘ despite years of research and ground - breaking discoveries ’			1
it also ‘ misses out crucial details about original commissioning , funding and work ’			0
the attraction allows visitors to see below their feet to the spot where the king was found by archaeologists in 2012			0
miss @entity38 has also objected to a projection of @entity3 's body as it would have appeared in his grave , branding it ' grotesque ' and saying it shows a lack of respect for the dead the exhibit also features a @entity124 printed model of @entity3 's skeleton which shows his infamous curved spine and evidence of the wound that killed him at the @entity130 since @entity3 's body was discovered buried underneath a car park in september 2012 , his remains and legacy have proved highly controversial			1
arguments immediately broke out over where he would be reburied , with his descendants claiming his body should be laid to rest in @entity138 , in accordance with his own wishes			2
however @entity142 judges have now ruled that his skeleton should remain in @entity12 , where it was taken by soldiers loyal to victorious @entity146 the skeleton is due to be sealed in a locked tomb at @entity149 next year			1
in 2012 , an archaeological excavation was undertaken in a city council car park using ground - penetrating radar on the site once occupied by @entity154			2
the @entity155 confirmed in february 2013 that all the evidence pointed to the skeleton that had been found in the excavation being that of @entity3 the skeleton of the last of the @entity161 kings was identified by dna analysis after researchers traced his living descendants			2
@entity3 was discovered in 2012 beneath a car park @entity3 was born in 1452 at @entity167 in @entity168			2
during the @entity170 , @entity3 's father , @entity171 , @entity172 was killed and in 1470 , @entity3 and his brother @entity169 were exiled when @entity173 , from the rival house of @entity175 , took back the throne			2
@entity146 's reign was short lived and during a battle the following year , @entity169 became king			0
in 1483 , @entity169 died and @entity3 was named as protector of the realm for @entity169 's son and successor , the 12 - year - old @entity169 @entity169 and his brother @entity3 were placed in the @entity185 and after a campaign to condemn the deceased king 's marriage to @entity190 , the princes were declared illegitimate			2
@entity3 took to the throne the following day			0
he was crowned in july and in august that year , the two princes disappeared			0
rumours spread the king had killed them to remove any threat they may have posed to his reign			0
in 1485 , @entity146 , @entity199 launched an attack on @entity3 on @entity130 in @entity201			0
many of @entity3 's key lieutenants defected and he was killed in battle			0
@entity146 took the throne as @entity146 supporters of the new king took @entity3 's body to @entity12 where it was buried without pomp or ceremony in the churchyard of @entity154			1
the exact location of the skeleton was lost to the ages until a team from @entity155 , using ground - penetrating radar , discovered it beneath a council car park			1
the remains were dug out in september 2012 , and in february the following year were confirmed to be @entity3 after dna analysis			0
next year the skeleton will be taken to @entity149 where it will be locked away in a sealed tomb .			0

@entity225 opens in @entity12 where body was discovered
but experts who lead search for the skeleton have branded it ' grotesque '
say painted suit of armour makes him look like a @entity17 stormtrooper
plans for a blood - soaked throne at entrance were *halted* after complaints
