for dinner the pair , who have four children , would order burgers from @entity6			1
@entity21 , left , weighed 22 stone , and her husband @entity23 , right , weighed 17 stone when they were turned away from the rides at @entity26 for being too fat and not being able to fasten the seatbelts @entity10 now weighs 11 stone and has dropped to a size 14 , while @entity23 lost almost seven stone weighing nearly 40 stone between them , the couple , from @entity32 in @entity33 , were shamed into losing weight when they found they were too fat for any of the rides during a family trip to @entity26			1

we could easily munch our way through three @entity47 each every morning			0
‘ we lived on takeaway food			2
and we would snack on @entity50 and hot chocolates too			0
it was embarrassing as the staff at @entity5 knew us so well , they knew our order without us having to ask for it			0
‘ we were n’t getting any fruit or vitamins and we were anaemic because of it			0
i never used to cook at home , we would have @entity43 's and @entity6 for every meal			2

@entity10 weighed 22 stone and @entity23 , 41 , weighed 17 stone			1
@entity10 said : ‘ it would n’t click over my stomach			1
the assistant saw me struggling and came over and told me that if i could n’t get it done up then i would have to get off the ride			2
they joined @entity77 and replaced takeaway meals with steamed vegetables and @entity80 ‘ @entity23 could n’t do his up either			2
we had to get off the ride with the children and they were crying			2
' it had upset the children so much			0
we had travelled all that way to go to @entity26 and they were so excited about going			1
' even playing with their children in the park was a problem because of their size			0
@entity10 said : ‘ when we took the children to the park they would beg us to run around with them , but we just could n’t			1
i ’d have to stay sitting on the bench and @entity23 ’s stomach was nearly as big as mine , so he could n’t either			0
‘ he could n’t play football with the boys because he was so big and if we took them swimming i would wear t - shirts and shorts to hide my flab			0
i felt so guilty on the children as they were missing out			0
’ the couple joined @entity77 in january after struggling to lose the weight initially			2
@entity10 said : ‘ we tried to lose the weight on our own , but we just could n’t , so we decided that we would join @entity77			1
that day at @entity26 was so awful it made us realise that we had to take drastic action			2
