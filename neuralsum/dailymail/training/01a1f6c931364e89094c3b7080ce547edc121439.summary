by @entity0 published : 09:24 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 11:04 est , 3 march 2014 @entity2 , who is known and loved in the fashion industry for her fun - loving and quirky personality , caused a stir when she made a selfie video on the @entity8 runway last week			2
and in an attempt to top her hilarious antics , the goofy supermodel was seen skipping down @entity13 's catwalk at the designer 's prestigious @entity15 show in @entity17 today			0
the 21 - year - old party girl did keep her composure during the main event when she served as @entity13 's clothes horse but let loose in the finale she and @entity23 giggled , shimmied and danced their way down the catwalk in front of the likes of @entity29 and @entity30			1
from oversized tweedy knit jumpers to matching knitted body bags worn across the chest , it seems that @entity13 shares the fashion industry 's vision for full - on knits ( take note come @entity53 )			0
but far from drowning her girls in her wooly creations , @entity13 employed her expert tailoring to offer a streetwear - meets - rap inspired collection in the most flattering form			0
models gone wild : front rowers , including @entity29 and @entity30 , tried to capture the models as they skipped by she ca n't be stopped ! @entity2 was seemingly in great spirits in @entity17 today as she took the fun factor backstage as well winter warmers : from oversized tweedy knit jumpers to matching knitted body bags worn across the chest , it seems that @entity13 shares @entity70 and @entity73 's passion for full - on knits this season , which she gave a sports luxe edge with zips , swirled rope embellishment and chunky neon soled shoes close : @entity13 and @entity2 share a hug backstage at the show			1
@entity2 , who is currently prioritising her acting career , only walked in a few shows this season and @entity13 was one of her top picks , as well as @entity88 and @entity8 best buddies : while @entity29 and @entity2 have n't been spotted hanging out a lot lately , the duo were reunited at the show in the @entity94 capital today continuing the sports luxe love - in , the 42 - year - old designer served up little evening dresses with a sporty edge and sporty sweats with zip embellishment			1
attention to detail did n't go amiss by @entity104 's daughter with hairy textures and silky tassels decorating her garments , plus splashes of tie - dye emblazoned on silky trousers and t - shirts ( bound to be a wardrobe staple of @entity2 's next season )			2
it was a case of ' the bigger the better ' when it came to parkas and anoraks , which came complete with mountaineering toggles and digital prints			0
@entity13 , who took a bow with her children at the end of the show , was possibly revisiting the raving youth of the @entity124 - also seen at @entity125 - and who better to show it off than the ultimate wild child , @entity128 ? big names : a tanned @entity2 was watched on the runway by @entity94 actress @entity30 ( right ) , who is herself a model too family matters : @entity29 , left , @entity13 's husband @entity133 , center , and @entity135 , occupied the front row today			1

a giggling , dancing @entity2 , 21 , joined @entity23 on @entity13 's runway today
watched by @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity13 's husband , @entity133 the pair had fun at the finale
@entity13 served up oversized knits with a sports luxe edge and tie - die detailing
