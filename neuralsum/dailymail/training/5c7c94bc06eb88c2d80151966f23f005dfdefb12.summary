prince @entity0 has delivered an impassioned plea to save the spiralling number of over- 50s shattered by redundancy from the scrapheap			2
he spoke from the heart about the ‘ lack of value ’ suffered by many of the estimated 425,000 middle - aged men and women currently unemployed in @entity11			1
but he also talked with pride about a charity he has set up to help mature workers who are out of a job or facing the threat of redundancy to start their own business			1
prince @entity0 talked with pride about a charity he has set up to help mature workers who are out of a job or facing the threat of redundancy to start their own business @entity20 – the prince ’s @entity22 – is the only organisation of its kind in the country to offer business advice and mentoring to older people and has already helped more than 23,000 in @entity30 and @entity31			1
@entity0 said : ‘ people feel they have no value any more and once you ’re made redundant clearly it ’s very difficult			0
‘ the great thing about all this effort is that no one should be afraid of backing someone because of their age because at the end of the day , if it ’s a good idea , it ’s a good idea , whatever age you are			0
‘ so we aim , through @entity20 , to show that there ’s still life in the old dog yet ! and so often we find that over- 50s who start their own businesses actually are more sustainable , in terms of a percentage of the success rate , than those who are younger			1
‘ so i think probably age and experience and wisdom does help you			0
’ speaking at @entity60 after a reception to celebrate the entrepreneurs @entity20 has helped to create , @entity0 , who turns 65 himself this year , could barely hide his frustration that so many older people are effectively being put out to pasture after redundancy			1
support : @entity0 , who turns 65 himself this year , hosted a reception at @entity60 , where guests included actress @entity70 ( pictured ) he talked about the dent in self - confidence that a once working , productive member of society can experience when they suddenly lose their job – ‘ a crying shame ’ , he said – when so many still need to provide for their families and have a desire to contribute			1
figures from the @entity82 highlight the nightmare facing a generation of older people when they are made redundant in their 50s			0
since the recession began in 2008 , the number of unemployed people aged 50 and above has rocketed by nearly 80 per cent to 425,000			2
of the total , one in four has been desperately looking for work without success for more than two years – which means self - employment is a hugely attractive proposition			2
@entity0 said that while he was proud of the work that his more well - known charity , @entity98 , had done in helping young people on to the job ladder , he felt that there was an equally important – and vulnerable – section of society that needed his help			1
@entity20 , set up in 1999 , has actively helped to set up more than 5,000 businesses , with a surge of people seeking support in recent years			1
@entity0 said : ‘ people were writing to me , they still do , that there is n’t anything out there to give them any help			0
‘ we can help people who want to develop a hobby sometimes into a viable business			0
we run courses which give them an idea about enterprise and business plans and how you manage cashflow and marketing and all these things , and provide them with a mentor			0
‘ we need to spread the word that @entity20 exists and we ’re here to help			2
