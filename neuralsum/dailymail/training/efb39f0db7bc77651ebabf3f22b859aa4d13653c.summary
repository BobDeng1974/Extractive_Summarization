by @entity0 published : 10:19 est , 15 april 2013 updated : 10:19 est , 15 april 2013 a vaccine against shingles could cut the risk of infection by half and reduce complications associated with the condition			1
new research has found that vaccine 's effectiveness against post-herpetic neuralgia - nerve pain that occurs at the site of a previous attack of shingles - was 59 per cent			1
shingles is an infection of a nerve and the surrounding skin			0
it is caused by the herpes varicella - zoster virus , which also causes chickenpox			0
battleground : vaccination has been shown to be incredibly effective in preventing shingles ( pictured ) most people suffer with chickenpox in childhood , and after the illness has disappeared , the virus remains dormant in the nervous system			1
the immune system usually keeps the virus in check , but later in life it can be reactivated and cause shingles			0
@entity37 tends to affect adults over the age of 50			0
it is not fully understood why the virus is reactivated , but it may be due to lowered immunity due to age , stress or another underlying condition			2
the lifetime risk of developing shingles is between ten and 30 per cent but this increases to 50 per cent in those aged 85 years or older			0
in the new study , dr @entity50 and her colleagues at the @entity52 , studied the medical records of 766,330 @entity56 private healthcare patients aged over 65 between 2007 and 2009			0
the vaccine could reduce much unnecessary pain suffering in the elderyl they found that while almost 13,000 participants developed shingles , the vaccine reduced the rate of infection by 48 per cent			2
but the research , published in medical journal @entity67 , did find that the vaccine was less effective against shingles in older adults with impaired immune systems			2
the vaccine is already widely used in the @entity56 and the @entity74 @entity73 ( @entity75 ) is keen to roll out an immunisation programme for everyone aged over 70			1
however the @entity75 has failed to negotiate a large enough contract with manufacturers to enable a national immunisation programme any time soon			1
this has put the @entity74 in a unique position – 60,000 doses have been supplied to @entity74 but there is no fair way of distributing them			1
it is not known when a nationwide scheme will be brought in			0
currently it is possible to get hold of the vaccine , @entity92 , on private prescription for a cost of around £ 100			2
dr @entity50 said : ‘ this study shows the effectiveness of the herpes zoster vaccine to prevent shingles and post-herpetic neuralgia in a general population of over 65s			0
‘ our findings should be taken in to consideration by those developing policy , particularly in the @entity74 where plans to offer the vaccine are being made			1

each year *250,000* @entity74 develop the condition
new vaccine could benefit over 50s most likely to suffer
*government* plans to roll out immunisation programme but date has not been *announced*
