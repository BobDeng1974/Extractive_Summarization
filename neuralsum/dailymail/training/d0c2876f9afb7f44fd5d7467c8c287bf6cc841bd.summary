families struggling to pay crippling heating bills this winter have been told by the energy watchdog to take packed lunches to work to save money			1
@entity6 has been criticised for offering ‘ patronising ’ advice , rather than focusing on stopping energy firms from ‘ ripping off ’ customers			0
energy companies have come under fire for not passing on a sharp fall in wholesale prices to customers , while price comparison websites have been accused of hiding cheap energy deals			1
it comes as a new study suggests energy firms have robbed the average family of £ 145 over the past year by failing to pass on a sharp fall in wholesale prices			1
but which ? said retail prices have not fallen in line with wholesale costs , cost consumers up to £ 2.9billion over the last year			1
this is equivalent of £ 145 per household on standard energy tariffs			1
last week it emerged firms have made almost 50 per cent more profit in a year			0
@entity6 said the average profit per household was £ 114 in the past 13 months – up from £ 77			1
but @entity6 itself has come under fire for not doing enough to stop customers being ripped off , and instead telling people to find other ways to save money to pay energy bills			2
while energy bills are still more than £ 1,300 , @entity6 suggested people could saving £ 735.80 by making packed lunches			1
in guidance issued by the regulator , drawn up by personal finance expert @entity56 , states : the average office worker spends £ 2.83 a day on buying lunch ( based on meal deals of a sandwich , drink and snack )			1
save your money and instead make and take your own food into work			0
' it also suggests cutting back on buying coffee , and instead take a flask to work			0
' cut back on a morning coffee each day by investing in a reusable flask			0
avoiding a £ 2.60 medium latte each day could help you save £ 676 across the year , ' the guidance said			2
people are also urged to ' get cheaper mobile phone bills by picking up a basic second - hand handset and then try out a @entity80 - only deal for a snip of the price '			2
@entity84 's shadow energy secretary @entity83 said : ' this is patronising rubbish			1
people do n't need lecturing on taking a packed lunch to work , jogging round the block or getting a second - hand mobile phone , they need a regulator that will stop energy companies ripping them off			1
' unfortunately , the reason the regulator has no teeth is because the @entity95 and @entity96 voted against giving the regulator the power to cut bills			2
' they now have nobody else to blame for the failure of the energy companies to pass on the full savings from wholesale cost falls to all consumers			2
' the next @entity84 government is committed to making big changes in our energy market : freezing energy prices until 2017 so that bills can fall but not rise , and giving the regulator the power to force energy companies to cut their prices when wholesale costs fall			1
' an @entity6 spokesman said : ' the last thing we intended to do back on 7 january 2015 was to give offence through a press release which was trying to get across the point that savings of up to £ 250 are available to energy customers			0
' the watchdog said it had referred energy firms to the @entity126 for a full investigation			0
but which ? said energy bills could have been slashed further and sooner than the recent flurry of cuts			0
the consumer group compared costs to suppliers of buying wholesale energy since 2013 to the prices paid by consumers through energy bills in the same period			2
it said the research suggests standard variable energy tariffs have not kept in line with wholesale prices over the last two years			1
which ? claimed it could find ' no justification ' to increases in gas and electricity prices in late 2013 , based on wholesale costs			2
it said the recent cuts of up to 5.1 per cent in standard gas tariffs by @entity155 suppliers should have been higher			0
if they were aligned with wholesale energy costs the cuts should have been in the region of 8.8 % to 10.3 per cent , equivalent to a decrease of between £ 777 million and £ 907 million a year to households on standard gas tariffs , the report claimed			2
@entity84 's shadow energy secretary @entity83 condemned the ' patronising rubbish ' from @entity6 it also said suppliers could reduce electricity prices by up to 10 per cent			1
which ? executive director @entity167 said : ' our analysis places a massive question mark over how suppliers have been setting prices over the last two years			0
they now need to explain to their customers why bills do n't fall further in response to dropping wholesale prices			1
' energy bills are consistently the top consumer concern so it 's about time people got a fair deal			0
' while the competition inquiry should establish beyond doubt whether the price people are paying today is right , consumers will now look to politicians of every party to set out how they 'll deliver fair and affordable energy prices in the future			0
' which ? said the research involved looking at commonly used buying or hedging models reflecting the range of approaches ' most likely ' to have been used by suppliers to estimate the cost of buying wholesale energy since 2013			0
@entity6 predicts the @entity155 will make £ 114 on the average dual fuel bill over the next year , up dramatically on the the £ 77 margin in 2014 wholesale costs are falling , making it cheaper for energy suppliers to buy gas and electricity before selling it on to families these costs were analysed against an estimate of what consumers have paid for wholesale costs through energy bills in the same period			1
@entity216 , chief executive of @entity217 , the trade association for the energy industry , said : ' customer deals are falling in price - over £ 100 cheaper than this time last year			2
' the which ? calculations are based on very many assumptions and do not reflect the cheaper deals we are seeing			0
' which ? points out that each company allocates their costs differently and this makes it difficult to estimate wholesale costs and hedging strategies			0
' indeed its hedging assumptions for 2013 are different from @entity6 's report based on the companies ' actual accounts			0
' costs are coming down but , because energy companies buy ahead to fix prices and to plan with certainty , the gas and electricity we are using today has already been paid for			0
' energy regulator @entity6 said it welcomes which ? 's contribution to the debate on energy prices			0
a spokesman added : ' we have consistently called for suppliers to explain the growing gap between wholesale prices and retail prices			1
' which ? 's report echoes @entity6 's concerns that bills go up faster in response rising wholesale prices than they fall when wholesale prices come down , which was one of the reasons for our referral of the market to the @entity126			1
