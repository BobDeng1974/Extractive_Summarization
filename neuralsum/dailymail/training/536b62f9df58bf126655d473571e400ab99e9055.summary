by @entity0 a cancer survivor has given birth to a baby boy after her first pregnancy was found to be a vicious tumour invading her womb			1
@entity7 and her then partner @entity8 were delighted when they discovered they were expecting their first child in 2010			1
but the couple 's excitement was crushed when doctors told them the unborn baby they so desperately wanted , was nothing more than a mass of cells			1
and in a cruel twist of fate , the mass of cells - known as a molar pregnancy - developed into an aggressive form of cancer			1
@entity7 , pictured on her wedding day with husband @entity8 , gave birth to their son @entity27 after her first pregnancy two years earlier , turned out to be a vicious cancerous tumour invading her womb @entity27 was born in march 2012 , after his mother mrs @entity7 beat her cancer with rounds of gruelling chemotherapy , that medics feared would leave her infertile mrs @entity7 , from @entity35 in @entity36 , was immediately referred for rounds of chemotherapy to help treat the tumour			1
remarkably , despite fears the gruelling treatment could have damaged the 40 - year - old 's fertility , mrs @entity7 discovered she was pregnant eight months after being declared cancer free			1
she said : ' when i discovered that i was n't actually pregnant i just could n't comprehend it			0
' i remember realising that i was n't going to be a mum anymore , and it felt like i was grieving for the child that i never had			0
' i felt like i 'd failed in so many ways and then to know i had n't even been carrying a baby in the first place was awful			0
' then to be told that the cells had turn into cancer was almost too much to handle			2
' it was particularly agressive so i had to be given chemotherapy that could affect my fertility			0
' i lost all my hair and it was such a difficult time			0
' but as soon as the chemotherapy was over and i was declared cancer free , i knew i still wanted to be a mum			0
' i fell pregnant eight months later with @entity27 - it was a scary time but he was totally worth it , i could n't be happier			1
' recalling finding out her first pregnancy was nothing more than a mass of cells , mrs @entity7 said : ' i remember realising that i was n't going to be a mum anymore , and it felt like i was grieving for the child that i never had ' mrs @entity7 found out she was expecting what she thought would be the couple 's first child in january 2010			1
the 40 - year - old , said : ' i was just beaming when i found out i was expecting			1
we had started telling people and going to baby shops to look at what to buy			0
' i 'd said that it might be nice to have a girl or even twins as i 'm an identical twin			0
it was all so exciting			0
' but a month into her pregnancy , mrs @entity7 noticed she was bleeding slightly and was referred to the @entity81 for a scan			1
' after everything that we went through , it 's like we 've finally got our happy ending ' - @entity88 survivor , @entity7 ' i thought the scan would be the first time i heard the baby 's heart beat , but i could n't have been more wrong , ' she said			1
' i was told that they could see the amniotic sac but they could n't see the baby			2
it was such a shock - i just did n't understand			0
' at first they said it might just be that they were scanning too early , and to come back a few days later			0
' but when i went back they confirmed it - the pregnancy was n't viable			2
' i burst into tears as they told me they needed to remove the mass of cells , and that afternoon i was taken for surgery			2
' i woke up 40 minutes later feeling empty			0
a doctor explained that there was no sign of a baby in the amniotic sac , and i had n't been pregnant at all			2
' but the couple 's grief was compounded when days after doctors removed the mass of cells - known as a molar pregnancy - they discovered mrs @entity7 , 40 , had cancer			1
her twin sister shaved her hair ( left ) as gruelling rounds of chemotherapy began to take their toll on her body eight months after being given the all - clear mrs @entity7 gave birth to baby @entity27 , and four months later she married her husband @entity8			1
she said : ' after everything that we went through , it 's like we 've finally got our happy ending ' @entity134 from the @entity135 said : ' a molar pregnancy is one where an abnormal fertilised egg implants in the womb			1
' the cells of the placenta grow very quickly and prevent it developing further , but the placenta keeps growing and pregnancy hormone levels continue to rise , so you will still have a positive pregnancy test result			2
' a molar pregnancy is often only diagnosed after the miscarriage has happened , during routine examination of the pregnancy tissue			1
' there is a very small chance that the molar cells can spread rapidly and become cancerous and so all women with molar pregnancy are referred for specialist follow - up			1
' if a cancer ( called choriocarcinoma ) does develop , the treatment is extremely effective			0
' the diagnosis of molar pregnancy can be very confusing , upsetting and frightening			2
' it can be difficult to understand what has happened and very upsetting to realise that the beginnings of your pregnancy never developed properly into the baby you thought you were carrying many weeks later			2
' many women and their partners are very frightened by the risk of cancer and you are likely to need lots of care and reassurance during your follow - up			0
' we suggest that you read our leaflet @entity176 ( @entity176 mole )			0
' it clearly explains molar pregnancy and the follow - up process and also includes comments from women who have had this kind of pregnancy loss			1
' you might also find it helpful to use our forum , where you can share your thoughts and feelings with others who have had a molar pregnancy			2
' it was only when mrs @entity7 was recovering at home that a letter from the hospital revealed there was a chance the mass of cells could become cancerous			1
two days later , @entity201 - a hospital that specalises in treating molar pregnancy - called to confirm she would need to monitor the levels of hormone pregnancy in her blood			1
however , the levels did not return to normal , indicating that mrs @entity7 had cancer			1
' i was home alone when i got the call , ' she said			0
' i 'd gone from an expectant mum to a cancer patient - it was unbelievable			0
' @entity8 was a fantastic support and assured me that we 'd beat it			2
' but it was a long struggle - the initial chemotherapy dose was too mild and the cancer remained present			0
' i was put on a higher dosage where i lost my hair and felt constantly sick			0
it could also have affected my fertility , the idea that i might never be a mother was horrific			0
' luckily the chemo worked and i was declared cancer free four months later			0
' doctors recommended the couple wait six months before trying for a baby again			2
and to their delight , mrs @entity7 discovered she was pregnant almost immediately			1
she said : ' when i fell pregnant again it felt like the nightmare was over			0
but once again everything went down hill - it turned out that i 'd had an ectopic pregnancy			2
' there was no link between that and the molar , but they had to remove one of my fallopian tubes			0
' finally , six weeks later i fell pregnant , and this time it seemed to be plain sailing			2
' i did n't have any morning sickness or tiredness			0
i finally felt happy again			0
' mrs @entity7 gave birth to the couple 's son @entity27 in march 2012 , and four months later she married her husband @entity8			1
' after everything that we went through , it 's like we 've finally got our happy ending , ' she said			1
' @entity27 is full of life and an absolute miracle - we 're over the moon			1

mrs @entity7 said : ' after everything we went through , it 's like we 've finally got our happy ending . @entity27 is an absolute miracle , we 're over the moon '
