by @entity1 reporter published : 08:22 est , 8 december 2012 updated : 08:27 est , 8 december 2012 in a blow for chancellor @entity4 financial markets have predicted @entity5 is heading for a triple dip recession @entity5 is on the brink of a triple - dip recession , experts warn as latest figures reveal industrial output has now fallen to its lowest level in 20 years			1
in a week when chancellor @entity4 put yet another squeeze on the hard working middle - classes , figures for october revealed manufacturing production dropped by 1.3 per cent - more than two per cent down on this time last year			1
markets had been optimistic that october would have seen a rise in industrial production but figures from the office for national statistics revealed it had fallen by 0.8 per cent			2
this was partly caused by a fall in @entity27 production of gas and oil , which has dropped by almost 50 per cent in the past three years			1
forecasts prepared by the @entity31 see the economy continuing to shrink for the final three months of 2012 before growth resumes early 2013 , picking up steadily throughout the course of the year			0
but the @entity31 has , in the past , been accused of being over-optimistic in its predictions and many economists question whether their figures would be met			0
some are calling this recession the worst yet - and while not as deep as those experienced in the 1920s and 1930s , recovery has been considerably slower			0
yesterday @entity44 declared that @entity5 must be more like @entity45 and develop a more modern workforce after companies complained of a lack of newly trained engineers			1
optimists have pointed to a strong start to the @entity53 shopping season and progress being made in @entity55 to tackle the sovereign debt crisis			0
the wider measure of industrial production fell 0.8 per cent , reflecting a record fall in oil extraction although this was partly due to maintenance on @entity27 rigs			1
making do : the fall in factory output was far worse than had been expected			0
industrial production fell 0.8 per cent , reflecting a record fall in oil extraction although this was partly due to maintenance on @entity27 rigs the decline adds to the recent flow of disappointing numbers for the @entity5 economy at the start of the fourth quarter and bodes ill for gdp after a rise of 1 per cent in the autumn ended the longest double - dip recession since the 1950s			1
the @entity78 said yesterday that the trade in goods deficit – the difference between exports and imports – widened to £ 9.5billion in october from £ 8.4billion in september			0
it came as exports fell one per cent in a blow to ministers pinning their hopes on booming demand for @entity5 goods overseas to more than make up for subdued spending at home			1
downturn continues : exports fell 1 per cent , dashing hopes on demand for @entity5 goods overseas exports are more than 10 per cent lower over the year to some major @entity55 countries including @entity45 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			1
however , exports to @entity104 are 7.6 per cent higher than a year ago			0
they were up 6.3 per cent to the @entity106 and 65.1 per cent to @entity107			0
the @entity78 noted ‘ a shift in the pattern of the @entity5 ’s trade ’ – with exporters becoming far less reliant on the troubled eurozone for business			2
@entity115 chief economist @entity114 said : ' judging by the official data that we have seen for the fourth quarter so far , notably retail sales , trade and industrial production , the @entity5 will struggle to avoid a renewed downturn in the economy after the brief return to growth seen in the third quarter			2
' the @entity31 this week slashed growth forecasts for the next five years and predicted a borrowing bill some £ 84billion higher than its last estimate			0
mr @entity114 added : ' while a dip back into contraction may prove mild and short lived , the concern is that any new downturn will not only put further pressure on the @entity5 's @entity136 credit rating but also provide a further set - back to a much needed improvement in business and consumer confidence			2

further fall in @entity27 production which has dropped by almost 50 per cent in the past three years
@entity44 declares @entity5 must be more like @entity45 and develop a modern workforce
fears a cold winter could spell further economic gloom
