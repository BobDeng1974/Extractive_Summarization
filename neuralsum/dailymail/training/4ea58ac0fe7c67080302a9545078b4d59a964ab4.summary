amish men walk to the @entity220 in @entity84 fending for themselves : a pair of young @entity5 boys play in a sandbox in front of the home of @entity227 the community has been torn apart by the scandal and highly - publicized court case traditions : an @entity5 buggy is driven down the road between the farms in @entity167 where a tight - knit community live by strict religious rules @entity238 broke away from the mainstream @entity5 in 1995 , seeking stricter cultural rules and @entity241 interpretation than is the norm in the eastern @entity6 community , authorities have said			1
he was the undisputed leader of his group , counseling relatives on religious matters , negotiating drilling rights on his land and denouncing @entity5 who questioned his authority			0
@entity12 's community , like many @entity5 groups , grew through marriage and the purchase of farmland to sustain extended families that work and pray together , mostly shut off from outside influences like electricity , autos and electronics			1
the five beard - and hair - cutting attacks followed years of animosity , traced in part to a nasty custody battle involving @entity12 's daughter and his strict demands on religious observance			2
the custody dispute led to a contentious history with local law enforcement over the county 's seizure of two @entity12 granddaughters from their mother			0
taking charge : younger members of the @entity5 community are being forced to put children to work to keep up with the labor after 16 adults were sentenced to serve prison sentences marching on : the @entity5 community has fascinated the outside world with its shunning of electricity , cars , electronics and the media one of @entity12 's daughters - in - law and a former brother - in - law told investigators that he allowed others to beat members who disobeyed him , according to an affidavit			1
he punished some by making them sleep in a chicken coop for days and was sexually intimate with married women to ' cleanse them of the devil , ' the two relatives said in the affidavit			0
@entity12 's defense argued there was no proof of such sexual conduct			0
his community had contact with other @entity5 groups , often because of family ties throughout the region or when gathering at livestock auctions or to buy farming equipment			2
some @entity5 spoke out against his authoritarian style , and the government said that led to the attacks as @entity12 tried to discipline dissenters who left his community and @entity5 bishops who condemned him .			1
