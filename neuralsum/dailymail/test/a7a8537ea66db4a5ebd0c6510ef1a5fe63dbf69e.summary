labour leader @entity0 secretly lobbied the @entity1 to change the time of popular comedy @entity3 on the night of the 1964 election because he feared working class voters would stay at home and watch the show instead of supporting his candidates			1
according to new archive footage held by the @entity1 , mr @entity0 went to the home of @entity1 director general sir @entity12 and told him the show could cost him 20 seats			1
mr @entity0 was leader of the opposition and was seeking to oust the @entity16 prime minister @entity15			2
the @entity18 leader thought the planned repeat of the sit - com starring @entity21 and @entity22 would hit them badly			1
the @entity1 is releasing an archive interview with sir @entity12 recorded in 1982 as well as a 1981 interview with the former prime minister			1
the joint project between the @entity1 and the @entity39 , which is being published today , shows the corporation 's involvement in elections since 1922			2
according to sir @entity12 's 1982 interview : ' he came around to have a drink			0
he had been very much upset because the @entity1 had planned the beginning of a series of repeats of a very popular light entertainment programme , @entity3 , on the evening of polling day			1
he thought that would keep away particularly @entity18 supporters from the polls			2
' at the peak of the show 's popularity , some 28 million people tuned in			0
sir @entity12 continued : ' @entity0 that evening began by accusing the @entity1 of plotting against him			1
i told him that he must really know in his heart of hearts that that was untrue , and unless he withdrew that remark there was no point in our discussing anything			0
we could just have a drink and that could be that			0
' he did withdraw and we talked about the @entity3 problem			0
the next day i discussed the matter further with the controller of @entity1 and we thought a good idea would be to shift it from early in the evening until nine o'clock , when at that time the polls closed			1
' i rang up @entity0 and told him about this decision and he said to me he was very grateful - it might make a difference of about 20 seats to him			1
' he won , i think , by four , and i 've sometimes wondered what effect my decision had on @entity82 political history			0
' former @entity1 director general sir @entity12 , pictured , said mr @entity0 feared broadcasting @entity3 on the 1964 election night could end up costing the @entity18 20 seats - they won the election by four mr @entity0 also gave an interview on the subject which has been published as part of the archive			1
he said : ' polling then ended at nine o'clock and a lot of our people - my people , working in @entity96 , long journey out , perhaps then a high tea and so on , it was getting late , especially if they wanted to have a pint first			2
' i said i did n't want a popular programme between eight to nine o'clock			0
it was the equivalent of bringing @entity102 back			0
@entity12 did n't think much of this argument			0
he said : " what would you prefer to put on between eight o'clock and nine o'clock ? " ' i said : " @entity107 drama , preferably in the original			0
