sacrifice : @entity1 was the only non-white man in his regiment they were all young , proud , and ready to serve king and country			1
but among the eager group of young men who had signed up to fight in the @entity9 together , one face stood out from the rest			0
@entity1 rushed to join the queue of recruits to the @entity13 when it was raised in september 1914 – and became the only non-white member of the 15th @entity15			1
yet were it not for a chance discovery almost a century later , his life – and death – might have been lost to history			0
a pair of broken and bloodstained spectacles in an @entity23 museum have shed light on the sacrifice of a volunteer who battled prejudice and racism to serve the country he made his home			1
they were the same glasses that ‘ @entity35 ’ , as he was called by his @entity38 comrades , had worn in a photograph taken at a training camp in @entity34			1
cruelly , the @entity41 - born student ’s race had barred him from fulfilling his dream of being an officer in the @entity44 , even though he was highly educated and had earned a degree in electrical engineering from @entity47			1
but it also won him a place in history			0
because less than 20 months after that training camp photograph , @entity1 was killed in action near the @entity53 on may 22 , 1916			1
academics believe that the 28 - year - old private had become the first @entity56 to die fighting for @entity58 in the war			1
although many more would later serve on the @entity60 in the @entity61 , at the beginning of the war , most @entity56 were banned from joining up in their own country because of racial prejudice			2
the catalyst that allowed the tale of @entity69 ’s spectacles to emerge publicly was dr @entity70 , a reader in @entity38 at @entity71 , who noticed them and some of his other belongings in a museum on a visit to @entity1 's home town of @entity77 , some 22 miles north of @entity78 in @entity41 , @entity23			1
one of the chaps : private @entity1 , centre , and his comrades pose for a photograph at a training camp in 1914 poignant : @entity1 's glasses and other belongings were discovered in a museum in @entity23 a book of friendship quotes given to private @entity1 by ' @entity90 ' , believed to be @entity91 when the academic mentioned his discovery during a talk at @entity47 , a local researcher recalled seeing @entity1 ’s name on its war memorial			1
from this , @entity99 researchers painstakingly pieced together one man ’s war			0
@entity1 had worked as an engineer while continuing with his studies			0
a photograph of a woman found in his personal effects , inscribed ‘ yours with love , @entity90 ’ , was found to be of @entity91 , who had links with the @entity111 in @entity99 where , it transpired , @entity1 sang in the choir			2
but although @entity1 was deeply involved in his local community , he faced discrimination even as he offered his life for the war effort			2
in an interview in 1988 , his fellow soldier @entity118 recalled : ‘ he was the best - educated man in the battalion and he spoke about seven languages , but he was never allowed to be even a lance corporal because in those days they would never let a coloured fellow be over a white man , not in @entity127			0
’ private @entity1 ( pictured wearing glasses ) with his comrades on deck during the voyage across the @entity132 from @entity133 to @entity134 , en route to the @entity60 in march , 1916 @entity1 is pictured far right with members of @entity137			1
the photo is thought to have been taken at @entity139 in @entity34 shortly after they signed up in 1914 dr @entity70 commented : ‘ i was absolutely stunned when i saw the pair of glasses			2
‘ it ’s one of the most poignant artefacts i ’ve seen – a material token of the fragility of life at the front			0
' more than a million @entity23 soldiers and non-combatants served in different theatres of the @entity9 , but what is so unusual about @entity1 is that he was not part of the @entity23 army but of the @entity157			2
‘ i sometimes wonder what his experiences would have been as the only non-white person in the battalion at that time			0
’ a photograph of a woman found in his personal effects , inscribed ‘ yours with love , @entity90 ’ , was found to be of @entity91 , who had links with the @entity111 in @entity99 where @entity1 sang in the choir private @entity1 ( fourth from the right in the third row back ) with @entity171 ( @entity137 ) of the 16th @entity15 in about 1915 it can not have been easy – but what has become clear is that @entity1 won the hearts and respect of his white comrades			2
shortly after his death , his commander wrote : ‘ his loss is felt very much throughout the whole of the company			0
‘ he always showed himself to be a keen and upright soldier , and myself and the officers of this company thought a great deal of him			0
’ a @entity189 @entity188 film tracing @entity1 ’s story is broadcast tonight on @entity191 ( @entity34 and @entity192 only ) at 7.30pm and is also available on @entity193 .			0
