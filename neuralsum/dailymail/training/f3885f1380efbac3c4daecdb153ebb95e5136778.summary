@entity2 , 38 , reveals he does n't like too much hair and he personally depilates everywhere			1
' if you have a hairy back , shave it ; brush your teeth ; fake tan i 'm not so much into			1
not too much hair i guess - i shave everywhere			1
i 'm kidding , i do n't shave everywhere ... but most places you do try to trim			1
' @entity2 likes to keep things fragrant as well as tidy : he reveals he is coming out with a new fragrance for men called @entity29 - a completely new venture for him			1
' i never thought i would say this but i was pretty involved in it , i wear it myself and i like it			2
' it has a woody kind of smell to it			1
i just went with my other favourites that i would wear in the past and combined them and said " this is the direction i want to take it in "			2
it 's going to come out towards the end of the year			2
' looking - and smelling - good is a priority for the star , who claims that since he 's turned 30 keeping in shape has n't been as easy			2
@entity2 , pictured earlier this month , says he prefers performing to burn calories rather than the gym ' one of the things i 've noticed , when you turn 30 and up , you 've got ta watch a little bit more what you eat			0
but in my case going on tour , two hours on stage , you actually lose a lot of calories which is good			0
i notice when i 'm not on tour i 'm not in as good shape			0
it helps me like a workout			0
' when it comes down to the gym or anything that 's cardio , like running on the treadmill , i 'm very lazy			0
what i like to do more is sports			0
whether it 's surfing or paying racquetball with my friends , you sweat a lot and i like that better			0
' and talking of getting sweaty ... we had to grill him about his chat - up lines			1
' my lines tend to be kind of stupid and immature , ' he says			1
' if a girl can laugh at a joke then i always think that 's cool			1
that 's fun , it 's a good opener			0
' and when it comes to dating , he likes to prepare things in advance but does n't like anything too loud or fancy			2
' i like dinner and a movie , and places that are not very loud			0
' ' my lines tend to be kind of stupid and immature			1
if a girl can laugh at a joke then i always think that 's cool ' the craving for simplicity is reflected in the title of his latest album , @entity12 and @entity100			1
' @entity102 is the first title i thought of when i listened to the album , ' he says			0
' a lot of times i thought , " maybe it 's too simple , too straightforward " , but every time i thought of a new title kept coming back to @entity12			0
' it 's something we can all relate to			0
