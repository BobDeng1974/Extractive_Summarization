a last - minute rush of shoppers visited the the ever - breaking healthcare.gov yesterday - what was supposed to be the final day people could enroll for insurance under the @entity12			1
however , the deadline has now been extended to tonight to give more people a chance to sign up			1
above , certified enrollment specialist @entity19 helps @entity21 enroll in the scheme demand : a last - minute rush of shoppers visited the ever - breaking website healthcare.gov yesterday not working : the malfunctioning website has now deployed a queuing system to deal with the high traffic the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) announced on @entity30 the website had ' surpassed a million site visits ' , according to @entity33			1
a staggering 850,000 of these visits happened before 2pm ( 7pm gmt ) , according to @entity29 spokesman @entity35			0
this followed more than 1.2million site hits at the weekend			0
the website - which has faced a series of problems since its launch - has deployed a queuing system to deal with the high traffic			1
this means more than 60,000 potential customers have been forced to leave an email address to be invited back later when the traffic is lighter			1
extension : yesterday was supposed to be the final day people could enroll for ' @entity12 ' under the @entity12			2
however , the deadline has now been extended to today to allow more people to sign up president @entity50 ( pictured left at a basketball game in @entity52 on sunday ) has insisted he is doing all he can to make sure people who miss the deadline can still get health insurance under a series of exemptions ms @entity35 told people wanting ' @entity12 ' to ' sign up today ' - but added : ' if you have trouble due to high - demand , we will make sure we help you get signed up '			1
customer @entity63 , 56 , told tv crews at a @entity66 library that she had been trying to sign up for health insurance - which kicks in on january 1 - since enrollment first became available , but had so far been unsuccessful			1
the @entity68 did n't have to test his patience with the error - prone website or spend hours on the phone with a volunteer ' navigator ' in order to sign up for new health insurance			1
a @entity77 official has confirmed that @entity50 simply dispatched his aides to the @entity66 insurance exchange 's office , where they filed his papers in person – while @entity50 himself luxuriated in his annual @entity84 vacation with his family			2
' his situation is unique , ' the official insisted			0
' the president could n't have used the @entity66 exchange 's website because the databases these sites use to confirm insurance eligibility would n't contain those sorts of records about him			1
' @entity50 chose ' a bronze plan ' – the cheapest option – according to the @entity77			0
but an official statement conceded the exercise ' is symbolic since the president ’s health care will continue to be provided by the military			2
' ' the implementation has been unsuccessful as far as i 'm concerned so far - i 'm almost in shock ' , she said at the @entity107			0
' it 's just so hard to believe they could be so inefficient with something so important			0
' the deadline for people to sign up for health care coverage was supposed to be 11.59pm yesterday			1
however , due to the site 's record traffic , the deadline has been pushed back to midnight tonight , according to the @entity117			1
the @entity77 has insisted that it is doing all it can to make sure people who miss the deadline can still get coverage under a series of exemptions , and apparently this date bait - and - switch is another way of trying to help			2
there is a ' hardship ' exception for some that permits them not to sign up any kind of health insurance at all without facing a penalty - the hardship being problems they 've encountered with @entity12 and its malfunctioning website			1
there will also be a ' good faith exception ' for others , according to a senior @entity50 administration official			0
' we 'll have a special enrollment period , ' the official said last week , for ' all those who make a good faith effort to get enrolled by the deadline ' but fail to do so			2
the official did not say how the government would determine whether or not the effort was made in good faith			0
still , others may simply get a break from insurance companies , which the administration has urged to be flexible with people who miss the deadline			2
problems : health secretary @entity156 speaks about the problems the troubled website has faced such is the uncertain state of ' @entity12 ' as it approaches what was originally supposed to be a defining moment - a signup deadline that would provide the first real test of the viability of the healthcare program brought into law by the @entity12			1
adding to the confusion is the fact that the original deadline for obtaining medical coverage was december 15			1
that was extended to december 23 after the federal government 's website , @entity174 , proved dysfunctional and sometimes non-functional			2
@entity50 said on friday that one million people had enrolled for new insurance plans under the law through @entity174 , which serves 36 states , and 14 state - run marketplaces			2
trying everything : president and mrs @entity182 met with a group of mothers last week in an effort to persuade them to have their children sign up for the healthcare insurance many more enrollments are a major priority for @entity50 's signature healthcare reform , which officials are still hoping will help millions of uninsured and under - insured @entity4 finally to obtain medical coverage by the end of march			1
it is not known how many consumers may have no insurance coverage during periods of 2014 if they failto sign up on @entity174 today			0
the @entity50 administration says it is trying to be flexible , but some @entity201 critics of the law say the frequent delays and changes have muddied the waters and confused people			0
' with no clarity as to when people should sign up and who they should pay and when , it 's a virtual certainty that many consumers will find themselves uncovered for a period of time through no fault of their own , ' senator @entity207 , a @entity208 @entity201 , said last week			0
administration officials said on friday there are fewer than 500,000 people who have received cancellation notices from their insurance companies and have not yet found alternatives			0
some were ' auto - enrolled ' in other plans by their insurance companies , the officials said			0
the pace of sign - ups has picked up since october and november when technical problems crippled the @entity174 website			0
anyone who tried the website in october and november and became stuck has been getting attention from the administration			0
officials sent more than two million emails to people who could not advance through the website			2
they have also made more than 600,000 phone calls to consumers and mailed notices to hundreds of thousands of people , officials said			0
' we are confident that we are doing everything we can so that individuals know what their options are to get coverage , whether it is at the marketplace or seeking it through the private insurers , ' said the senior official .			0

more than one million @entity4 shoppers visited healthcare.gov in past 24 hours
original deadline for enrolling for health insurance was 11.59pm yesterday
