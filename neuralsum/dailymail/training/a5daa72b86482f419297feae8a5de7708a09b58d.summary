@entity0 refuses to even discuss the idea of tightening laws to prevent knife - wielding thugs avoiding jail a crackdown to prevent knife - wielding thugs escaping jail is being opposed by @entity0 and other senior @entity7 , extraordinary leaked @entity9 papers reveal			1
despite heightened public concern over knife crime following the classroom stabbing of teacher @entity13 , the deputy prime minister and senior colleagues flatly refused to support a tightening of the law in private @entity19 talks this week			1
in one letter to mr @entity0 , sent on tuesday and marked ' restricted ' but leaked to the @entity21 , chief secretary to the treasury @entity22 insists jailing more offenders caught with blades would cost too much money			1
‘ it is very hard to see how it could be afforded			0
the @entity23 does not support this amendment and i am not willing to clear it , ’ the @entity7 minister writes			0
in another letter to the deputy prime minister , @entity7 schools minister @entity32 says mandatory minimum sentences are ‘ too blunt an instrument ’ and he is also ‘ unwilling ’ to support the proposed change in the law			1
justice secretary @entity39 has drawn up plans to legislate so that offenders caught more than once with a blade are automatically jailed , according to senior sources			1
the review is understood to have been prompted by alarming evidence that thugs are escaping jail despite repeatedly flouting the law by carrying knives			2
currently , around four out of five of those convicted of a knife crime do not go to prison			2
incredibly , forty per cent of criminals with at least three previous convictions are given soft sentences , such as fines , cautions , community punishments or suspended jail terms			2
in a move backed by home secretary @entity60 , education secretary @entity61 and defence secretary @entity62 , mr @entity39 is proposing to use a new @entity63 to make sentencing tougher for knife possession			1
conservative ministers want the measure put before mps within weeks , pointing to heightened public anxiety over knife crime in the wake of the tragic death of 61 - year - old mrs @entity13 in her @entity73 classroom on monday			1
stabbed : conservative ministers want the measure put before mps within weeks , following the death of 61 - year - old @entity13 in her @entity73 classroom on monday but the documents leaked to the @entity21 reveal that the proposal has become the subject of a fierce argument at the top of the coalition			1
one well - placed source said mr @entity0 , who chairs the @entity9 home affairs committee , declined even to discuss it when it was raised in a meeting of the senior ministers on the body on wednesday			1
‘ @entity39 pointed out that they had not talked about this change in the law to introduce much more serious penalties for knife crime and this was the forum to discuss it , ’ said the source			2
‘ @entity0 said “ we have n’t discussed it and i am not going to have it discussed ”			1
he said “ i ’m in charge of this committee - forget it ”			0
’ @entity104 say they now plan to vote in favour of the measure despite the @entity7 stance , with a @entity109 motion expected to be tabled as soon as today by backbench mp @entity110			0
rejected : @entity22 wrote this letter , leaked to the @entity21 , telling @entity0 the laws would be too costly in a letter dated april 29 , sent by mr @entity22 to mr @entity0 ahead of the meeting , the chief secretary said he had ‘ serious concerns ’ about tightening the law			1
‘ it would impose a substantial new pressure on the prison population as soon as it is implemented			0
the @entity123 ’s budget is already under significant strain and this proposal would certainly not be affordable before 2016/17 , ’ he wrote			0
‘ it is very hard to see how it could be afforded afterwards given the further fiscal consolidation required in the next @entity129			0
’ mr @entity22 acknowledged mr @entity39 ’s pledge only to implement the new system when it is affordable , but added : ‘ my strong view is that we should not be seeking to put measures on the statute book if they could not realistically be commenced for several years at best			1
‘ the @entity23 does not support this amendment and i am not willing to clear it			0
’ schools minister mr @entity32 , in a letter to mr @entity0 dated april 14 , insisted judges should be free to give repeat offenders whatever punishment they see fit			1
@entity32 branded the mandatory minimum sentence ' too blunt an instrument ' in his letter to @entity0 justice secretary @entity39 ( left ) said now is the time to discuss a change in the law but @entity7 and chief secretary to the treasury @entity22 ( right ) insists tighter restrictions would be too costly ‘ the principle of judicial discretion is the cornerstone of our sentencing framework and mandatory minimum sentences restrict such discretion and can lead to unintended or unwelcome outcomes , ’ he wrote			1
‘ i have concerns about the impact on the prison population and the deliverability of the policy within this @entity129			0
i am therefore unwilling to clear this proposal			0
’ another coalition source said veteran cabinet minister @entity167 , who was mr @entity39 predecessor as justice secretary and was attacked as too liberal by mps on the @entity170 of his party , is understood to be the only senior conservative backing the @entity7 position			2
‘ @entity175 does n’t like any toughening up of the justice system at all , ’ said the source			0
it is understood that the tightening in the law so that anyone convicted on their second offence – or more – would automatically be jailed			2
it would mean several hundreds more offenders a year facing jail and sent a powerful message to criminals that the use of blades will not be tolerated			1
tragic : hundreds of tributes have been left outside @entity192 for mrs @entity13 after her death , believed to be the first killing in a @entity196 classrom , shook the nation today mrs @entity13 's family gathered to read the tributes as conservative leaders were said to be drafting plans to legislate so that offenders caught more than once with a blade are automatically jailed the @entity104 made toughening the law on knife crime a key manifesto pledge , suggesting before the last general election that anyone caught carrying a knife should expect to face a prison sentence			1
to the fury of right - wing @entity104 , mr @entity167 abandoned the idea of a blanket promise , but the government has taken a series of steps to tighten the law for some offenders			2
the government introduced an offence of ‘ aggravated knife crime ’ for over- 16s who use a knife to threaten or endanger others in a public place , which is supposed to carry a mandatory custodial sentence			0
the offence of aggravated knife possession came into force at the end of 2012			0
judges must impose a custodial sentence - a minimum six months for an adult or a four - month detention and training order for 16 and 17 year olds - unless the court considers there are special circumstances which would make it unjust to do so			0
despite the crackdown , @entity219 figures last year found that even in such cases , fewer than half of those found guilty of threatening someone with a knife were receiving a jail term			2
a senior @entity7 source said : ' this policy is under discussion and no decisions have been taken			0
different members of the government , of different colour , have expressed concerns about its affordability			0

conservative ministers have drafted legislation to jail knife offenders
those caught with blades more than once would be jailed under new laws
follows tragic death of teacher @entity13 , 61 , stabbed in classroom
but @entity0 refuses to enter into debate , senior sources reveal
@entity22 insists would be ' too costly ' , @entity32 also *blasted* move
