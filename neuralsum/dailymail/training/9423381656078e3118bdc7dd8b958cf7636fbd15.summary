murderer : @entity4 , seen being escorted by police officers at @entity3 ' @entity2 , is seeking early release from prison serial paedophile child killer @entity4 has been denied early release from prison amid fears he will re-offend			1
a @entity12 court today turned down a request by the 56 - year - old to serve out the rest of his life sentence at home under electronic surveillance			1
it came after @entity4 's mother warned that her son will kill again if a court grants his appeal for early release from prison			1
the court then said there were ' no grounds ' for an early release , citing the ' absence of any prospect that @entity4 ' could be reintegrated into society			1
@entity30 , 78 , described her son as a ' repeat offender in his soul ' and begged judges to keep him behind bars			1
the 56 - year - old psychopath was arrested in 1996 and jailed for life in june 2004 for the kidnap , rape and torture of six young girls in the mid- 1990s , four of whom died			1
but he has now applied for early release under @entity12 laws which state prisoners can be freed after serving 15 years of a life sentence if they are no longer a risk			1
but his mother @entity49 has told @entity12 's @entity51 newspaper : ' i am certain he will start again			1
@entity4 is n't ready to be released because he still wants to attribute to others the responsibility for what he did			2
' this is a repeat offender in his soul , as he has already proved throughout his life			1
' @entity4 insists he is no longer a danger to the public and it is his ' human right ' to live at home wearing an electronic bracelet			1
judges will consider his application in private at @entity12 's sentencing court in the capital @entity3 at 2pm today - two months before he becomes eligible for release in april			2
the demand comes after @entity4 's hated ex-wife @entity70 was freed from prison earlier this year to spend the next ten years ' at prayer ' in a convent			2
@entity74 , 52 , had served 16 years of 30 - year jail term for complicty in the imprisonment and murder of her husband 's young victims			0

@entity12 's @entity110 newspaper said : ' according to the law , the sentencing court must take into account the views of the prosecutors , the prison and the victims ' families			0

chilling : a policeman walks down some steps in the house where @entity4 held some of his victims captive in an underground ' cell ' , right @entity171 : @entity4 tied his young victims to a bed on the underground dungeon in which he held them beneath his home in the @entity128 suburb of @entity129 @entity178 fury boiled over and more than 300,000 people took to the streets of @entity3 in october 1996 in a series of marches to protest at judicial incompetence			0
