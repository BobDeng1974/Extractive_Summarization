by @entity0 published : 20:05 est , 3 february 2013 updated : 04:45 est , 4 february 2013 @entity1 : the loyal supporter of @entity3 may return to quash any dissent as tensions in the party bubble over @entity1 is being lined up for a @entity9 return to help crush three fledgling plots against @entity3 ’s leadership			1
senior allies of the prime minister say he is considering making the former defence secretary chief whip to get a grip on his backbenchers as rebellion spreads even further than first thought			1
the @entity19 can reveal that @entity21 whips believe they have uncovered two more plots against mr @entity3 after allies of backbencher @entity24 were exposed last week for promoting him as the next @entity21 leader			1
the second plot involves a former @entity28 officer who has attempted to recruit supporters from among mps who used to serve in the @entity31 for what the leadership has branded a ‘ military coup ’ against the prime minister			1
at least one minister and several @entity37 have been approached with a view to joining the conspiracy - though party managers believe most have said no. separately ministers ousted in mr @entity3 ’s last reshuffle and those who have never been given a job have also privately discussed whether to act against him			1
this third ‘ plot ’ has not yet reached ‘ lift - off ’ according to mps in the know			0
but whips are monitoring this group of the ‘ disgruntled and the dispossessed ’			0
insiders say none of these three plots yet has the momentum to oust the pm , but concede the three groups of plotters are ‘ somewhat interlocking ’ and reflect ‘ widespread dissatisfaction ’ with mr @entity3 ’s leadership			1
treasury minister @entity59 today dismissed rumours of an imminent leadership challenge as ' a load of rubbish			1
' i ’ve neither been approached or asked to join anyone ’s team			0
we ’ve got a very good leader of the party , ' he told @entity71			0
current chief whip sir @entity72 called in mr @entity24 for a dressing down last thursday after he was named as the central figure in a plot to oust mr @entity3			1
but some of mr @entity3 ’s closest aides now want dr @entity1 to return as chief whip in a move that would be popular with the @entity79 and give him the authority to act against the plotters			1
insiders say he has served his time after quitting over his friendship with lobbyist @entity85 and remained loyal			0
he was a staunch supporter of mr @entity87 ’s recent speech on @entity88 and has remained close to chancellor @entity89 and justice secretary @entity90			1
sir @entity72 was ushered into retirement last autumn but recalled after @entity94 ’s resignation one month into the job			0
ploy : @entity24 was found to be plotting against @entity3 the ‘ military coup ’ plotters have privately discussed their options but unlike mr @entity24 ’s supporters - dubbed the @entity101 after his constituency - they have not identified a potential leader			2
@entity21 chiefs believe mr @entity24 , who has campaigned to scrap the expenses watchdog @entity105 , has primarily won support from mps who were publicly humiliated over their second homes allowance claims			2
those named in connection with one or other of the plots include @entity112 , @entity113 - an @entity114 contemporary of mr @entity3 - @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 , a former army colonel			2
mr @entity119 denies any involvement in plots but is widely reported to have sent a letter to @entity123 , chairman of the @entity124 calling for a vote of no confidence in mr @entity3			2
@entity1 with his best man @entity85			0
@entity1 was forced to quit over his friendship with the lobbyist a vote would be triggered if mr @entity123 receives 46 letters			0
mr @entity113 , who is an ally of mr @entity24 , was ousted from the whips office in mr @entity3 ’s reshuffle and also served as a @entity28 platoon commander with the @entity135 , is seen by party chiefs as the link man between the three groups			2
he also faced embarrassment over expenses when he was forced to repay £ 4,000 claimed on the wrong property			0
mr @entity113 , who was a year above mr @entity3 at @entity114 and whose wife @entity142 used to date the pm , has denied seeking to oust him but has publicly voiced his admiration for mr @entity24 ’s leadership potential			0
yesterday he told a sunday newspaper : ‘ it ’s got nothing to do with me			0

former defence secretary could stage comeback as chief whip to rein in *mutinous* backbenchers
the staunch @entity3 supporter could please @entity79
there are believed to be three @entity21 plots against the prime minister
treasury minister @entity59 dismisses idea of *mutiny* as ' total rubbish '
