a man who was diagnosed with an extremely aggressive form of cancer two years ago is now amazingly in remission thanks to a revolutionary treatment that involved receiving an infusion of the virus that causes @entity7			1
@entity8 of @entity9 , was one of 30 leukemia patients to undergo a trial treatment at @entity12 recently , in which white blood cells are implanted with a harmless form of @entity16 programmed to target and kill cancer			1
the 30 - year - old married father of one has so far responded well to the treatment and is now cancer - free for the first time in years			2
pictured above with wife @entity27 ( left ) and their son @entity28 ( center ) the 30 - year - old @entity9 man was one of 30 patients in an experimental trial , who received doses of the deactivated @entity16 virus , which act as cancer killing fighters in the body			1
of those who underwent of the treatment , 23 are still alive and 19 are now in remission @entity8 , wife @entity27 and their young son @entity28 have been travelling the country ever since he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2012 , just one year after their marriage , searching for an effective treatment for his cancer			1
' they were a young couple			0
they were n’t married very long			0
they had a brand new little baby when all of this started , ' neighbor @entity55 told @entity56			0
the @entity57 did n't find success though until they met dr @entity59 at @entity12			0
dr june and his team of physicians have spent two decades working on a breakthrough experimental treatment using the hiv virus			0
on thursday , @entity8 was welcomed back to his @entity9 neighborhood , after travelling the @entity66 these past two years for treatment @entity8 ( center ) and his wife @entity27 ( left ) are pictured above with dr @entity59 , who led the gene therapy trial at @entity12 ' we were calling it our hail mary pass , ' @entity8 said			1
… we did n't know how we were going to get out there , what we were going to do , but it worked			0
by @entity80 's grace i was able to come back			0
' on thursday , a healthier @entity8 returned to his neighborhood in @entity9 to a surprise homecoming celebration			0
the connection between leukemia and @entity16 was first discovered in 2006 , when an hiv - positive man named @entity86 was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia			1
after receiving a bone marrow transplant from a donor with a rare genetic mutation , @entity86 's cancer went into remission and the @entity16 disappeared from his system making him the first man to ever be fully cured of the virus			2
dr june is now looking to use the treatment to combat other types of cancer			0
@entity8 ( right ) pictured above with his wife ( left ) and their son ( center ) since then , dr june and his team have been working vigilantly on developing a hiv - based treatment for leukemia and this october , published a study showing the therapy 's success on 30 cancer patients			1
the patients who received the treatment had billions of t - cells extracted from their body , which were taken to a lab and implanted with deactivated @entity16			1
the ' serial killer ' cells are then put back into the body to fight and kill cancer , and remain dormant until the cancer reappears			2
while the idea of receiving a dose of @entity16 may seem scary to some , dr june says there 's nothing to fear about the stripped - down virus used in the treatment			2
' it 's a disabled virus , but it retains the one essential feature of @entity16 , which is the ability to insert new genes into cells , ' dr june explained			0
of the 30 leukemia patients who received the treatment , comprised of five adults and 25 children , 23 are still alive and 19 are in remission			1
seven - year - old @entity138 was the first child to receive the treatment in 2012 , and has been cancer - free for two years now			1
dr june and his team are now looking at using the @entity16 treatment to attack other forms of cancers , and will be starting trials this summer for pancreatic cancer patients			2
seven - year - old @entity147 was the first child who underwent the experimental t - cell treatment in 2012 ( left )			2
she is still cancer - free two years later ( right )			0

@entity8 was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2012 and has spent the last two years searching for an effective treatment
he found a *solution* at @entity12 , where he was accepted into a trial to receive an experimental new gene therapy
the treatment involved implanting white blood cells with deactivated @entity16 and *injecting* them back in the body to fight off cancer
of the 30 patients involved in the trial , 23 are still alive and 19 are in remission - like @entity8
