by @entity0 follow @ @ lauriewhitwell for eight years @entity2 ’s critics have beaten him with the prettiest , heaviest , most valuable stick imaginable			2
but this genius player now has the chance to lift it above his head in celebration			0
the stick is the @entity9 trophy – a 14in , 11lb , 18 - carat statue signifying the absence of international success for @entity2 , a man who has won everything there is in club football			1
for all the mesmerising goals , captivating slaloms , cute passes , manifold medals and staggering statistics , his inability to drag his country to a first @entity9 title since 1986 has been , for some , a barrier to entering the game ’s gilded hall of all - time greats			2
he was the brilliant virtuoso in an ordinary team , the lighthouse in a shallow pool , and @entity34 topped all other nations in @entity52 28 years ago because of his ability			0
at @entity54 he got them to the final			0
@entity2 ’s fault , by comparison , has been a failure to repeat that most remarkable of football narratives			0
in truth , his opportunities have been limited			0
he forced his way into the squad for @entity66 2006 as an 18 - year - old and became the youngest player and scorer for @entity34 at a @entity9 in the 6 - 0 win over @entity71 and @entity72			1
but he was a teenage newcomer nonetheless			0
four years ago in @entity73 , @entity46 was manager and his ideas for @entity2 were some way off central			1
‘ @entity77 plus 10 , ’ was how he described his team			0
what pressure ? @entity2 ( front left ) looked relaxed in training earlier this week ahead of sunday 's final write caption here talking tactics : @entity46 puts an arm around @entity2 during the 2010 @entity9 centre of attention : @entity2 is closed down by several @entity87 players during the 2010 @entity9 @entity88 to cheer @entity2 & @entity34 in @entity9 final in @entity90 , @entity2 has been granted a platform to perform and seized it			1
@entity46 may have repeated his claim about @entity77 after the midfielder ’s superb performance against @entity35 but without @entity2 , there would have been no semi-final match to speak of			1
at 27 , his athletic peak , he has produced when it matters , getting decisive goals in three group games and laying on @entity101 ’s winner against @entity102			0
before this tournament , @entity103 had , to common consensus , wrestled the crown of world ’s best from @entity2			1
phenomenal scoring for club and country , topped off with @entity113 glory , edged @entity103 ’s claim			1
down and out : @entity103 struggled at the @entity9 as @entity115 crashed out emotional scenes : @entity103 breaks down in tears as wins the @entity118 earlier this year historic moment : @entity103 ( right ) celebrates scoring as @entity119 win the @entity113 standard bearer : @entity2 has long been compared to @entity46 , who won the @entity9 in 1986 national hero : @entity122 is mobbed by fans after helping @entity90 win the 1970 @entity9 in @entity52 it came combined with a relative lull in @entity2 ’s form and fitness			1
just the 41 goals in 46 games for @entity131 last season			0
perhaps affronted by the notion his rival has risen to prominence , perhaps electing to strike hardest under the globe ’s gaze in @entity137 , @entity2 has responded			0
masterminding victory over @entity66 in the final would get him to the summit of individual acclaim once more			2
as well as @entity46 , he would join @entity122 , winner of three @entity142 , when regular discussions take place on the best to ever kick a ball without any footnote or disclaimer on international merits			1
his exploits in @entity90 have already gone plenty to lifting @entity34 albatross from around his neck , but winning on sunday would place a golden frame around his picturesque career .			2

@entity2 will captain @entity34 against @entity66 in sunday 's @entity9 final
if @entity34 triumph , @entity2 will be up there with @entity46 and @entity122
@entity103 led real to @entity113 glory but @entity2 can surpass that
@entity2 has scored four goals at the @entity9
